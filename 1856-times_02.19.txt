I DBAE1O AXDTQA, OP X! BAAM. On - ---- nSunday -a musiian who may be said to have ;rnmied a connectinig -link -between-te-mnn-of] the present generation and their grandfathers breathed his Last. Seldom has there been so remarkable a case of professional longevity as that of Mr. John Braham. There is scarcely a person living too old or too young to have heard him sing. -Bornat London in 1774, of parents of the Hebrew persuasion, he is one of the many instances of that aptitude of the- Jewiish race for music which can scarcely have escaped the notice of any observer of the present age. At a very early age he was confided, already an orphan, to the care of Leoni, an Italian singer of celebrity, and made his d61m as a public singer before he had attained his 11th year, when, from the quality and compass of his voice, he was enabled to sing several 'raxurnsongs that had been written for Madame Mara. When he lost his boyish voice his future prospects appeared doubtful, but he found agenerous patron in MIr. Abraham Goldsmith, and became a professor of the piano. On his voice regaining its power he went to Bath, and there, in the year 1794, made his first appearance at some concerts that took place under the direction of M. Rauzzini, who, appreciating his talent, gave him musical instraction for three years. In 1796 young Braham was engaged by the stillremembered composer Signor Storace, for Drarylane Theatre, and his J'btt (which was in an opera called Mahmoud) was so successful that in the year following he was engaged for the Italian Operahouse. Hoping, however, to achieve a reputation more permanent than could be obtained by any other course, he resolved to visit Italy and there to complete his musical education. Florence was the first city at which he appeared in public; thence he went to Milan and afterwards to Genoa, at which latter place he studied composition under Izola. Leaving Italy in conseqaence of numerous solicitations from his own country, where the intelligence of his Italian saccesses had awakened a lively cuiosity, he made his d9but at Covent-garden in 1801. Thnis iSs the point from which may be dated that triuniphant career during which he created a constant foriore, the effect of which has lasted in some degree even to the present day. A vocalist who WaS also asn accomplished musician was a rare spectacle at the commencement of the present century, and for many years he was without a competitor. Long after his voice had lost its original power he was successively engaged at several theatres on the strength of a reputation which seemed undying, and his proficiency in sing,ing andel's musicwas universally acknowledged when his career as a dramatic vocalist hadreachedl its termination. The facts may be deemed interesting that the opera in which he made his first appearance after his return from Italy was a work byMessrs.Mazzinghi and Reeve, entitled the Chains of tJc 'Reart, that for a series of years (terminating in 1810) he sang at the King's Theatre, in concert with Mesdames Billington, Foder, and Grassini; and thst when Weber composed his opera Oberom1, for the English stage he was the original Sir Huon. Whie his success as a vocalist was without precedent, Mr. Braham was also renowned as a composer. Not only did he write several of the most pular songs, but he composed a tolerably long list of entire operas, as they were called in their time, though, according to present notions, they were merely dramas, interspersed -with occasional songs. Of these the most celebrated were perhaps the Cabiwet and the Devil's Bridge, relics of which willbefoundineveryold-fashioned book. The only vocation which Mr. 33raham tried without success was that of manager. The St. James7s Theatre, which he built as an opera-house, and which was first opened in 1836, never satisfactorily answered the purpose for which it was origially intended. In private life Mr. Braham was generaUly respected. He moved in good society, and among his acquaintance his fame as a man of extensive information and as a humorous retailer of anecdote was Ecarcely inferior to his reputation as a vocalist among the general public.
DEATH OF THE DUKE OF AORFOLK, K. G. We deeply regret to announce the death of the Dulke of Norfolk, which took place yesterday morning, at Arundel Castle, the ancient baronial seat of his illustriou3 family in Sussex. His Grace during the last two years has been in an unsatisfactory state of health, -which has occasioned uneasiness to the members of his family, but not alari. It appears his Grace was seized with serious symptoms yesterday morning, which caused the atmost alarm to the Duchess, and at a fewv minutes before 10 o'dock the noble Duke expired. The deceased, Henry Charles, Duke of Xorfolk, Earl of Arundel, Surrey, and Norfolk, and Baron Fitzalan, Clun, Oswaldestre, and alVtravers in the peerage of England, thePremier Duke and Hereditary Earl Marshal, was the only child of Bernard Edward, 15th Duke of Norfolk, by Lady Elizabeth Belasyse, third daughter of Henry, second and last Earl of Fauconberg, which marriagwas dissolved in May, 1794. The deceased Duke was born 12th of August, 1791, and married 27th of December, 1814, Lady Charlotte Leveson Gower, eldest daughter of Granvi'le first Duke of Sutherland, and sister of the present Duke. By that marriage the late Duke had issue three sons and two daughters -namely, the Earl of Arundel and Surrey (now Duke of Norfolk), Lord Edward Fitzalan Hooward, MLP., married to Miss Talbot, niece of the late Earl of Shrewsbury, Lord Bernard Howard, who died in Egypt a few years ago; Lady Mary, married to Lord Foley, and Lady Adeliza, married last autumn to Lord George Manners, .P. His late Grace, when Earl of Surrey, wasthe firstRoman Catholie who took the oaths and his seatin the House of Commons after the passing of the Roman Catholic Emancipation Act in 1829. The billreceived the Royal assent onthe 13th of, April, and Mr. IL H. Hurst, ALP. ifor Horsham, resigned his seat, and the Earl of Surrey was returned for that family borough, and took his seat in the House of Commons on the 6th of May following. He was again returned for Horsham at the general elections of 1830 and 1831 At the next general election in, 1832,he was returned, in conjunction with Lord George Lennox, for the Western Division of Sussex, and continued its representative up to 18I1, when his Grace was sunmnoned by writ to the House of Lords, during the lifetime of his father, by the title of Baron Maltravers, one of the ancient titles of the family; and on the 16th of March, 1842, he succeeded to the dukedom, on the death of his father. His Grace had filled several offices in Her Majestys household. In July, 1839, he was appointed Tresurer of the Queen's Household, and made a Privy Councillor, having succeeded Sir W. H. Fremantle, who had discharged the duties of that office more than 20 years. On Sir Robert Peel's retirement from office in July, 1846, he succeeded the Earl of Jersey as Master of the Horse, which office he held until the formation of the Earl of Derby's Ministry. On the Earl of Aberdeen taking offlce he was mnade Lord Steward of the Household, but soon afterwards relinquished that place to Earl Spencer, in December, 1833. In politics it is almost unnecessary to say his Grace was a stanch Whig. He was highly incensed at the Papal aggression, and the same year his Grace renounced the Roman Catholic faith, and passed over to the Anglican Church. Th1e deceased Duke Is succeeded In the dukedom -x~a ancient family honours by his son Henry Granville, Earl of Arundel and Surrey, born Nov. 7, 1815, and married on the 19th of June, 1839, toAugusta Mary, daughterof Admiral Sir Edmund Lyons, G.C.B., Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Eleet, by whom he has a youtthful family. The present Duke was formerly in the Royal Horse Guards; and on his retirement from the army, in 1837, entered the House of Commons as representative for Arundel, which he sat for in several Parliaments. He also sat for the city of Limerick for a few months, The Duke is a rigid Roman Catholic, and highly esteemed by the Romish dlergy. The late Duke was a Knight of the Garter, a Mellow of the Royal Society, and several other societies. The hereditary office of Earl Marshal, so long continued in the Norfolk family, is descended h;' the female side from Thomas De Mow,bray Earl of 2Nottinghau, the first EarlMlarshal of England,
ONE INCIDE 3W FAVouR OF THE N:?W POLICE BilL-Tinivell is a small village in the county of Rutland, one and a-half mile from Stamford, IUncolnshire. A few ,ights ago the house of r. Bradsbavv, the well known sheep-breeder, who resides at Tinive7ll, was burglariously cntered, and among the property stolen was a gold medal and a silver mnedal, awyarded to 3r. Bradshawv at the recent Snuthfield ClUb Shov. On the discovery of the bul6ary next morning the aid of the Stanford polce was soueht, but, as Tinivell is beyond the limits of that bormigh, r Bradahaw's messenger was referred to the chief constable of Rutiland, who real es at Oakham, ten miles distant, The Polica Gazce has since given the description of three men supposed to have committed the burglary, and who left Stamford after information was given to the police of tht town. Of comse, before the Butland officer arrived at Stamford the thieves were m an miles distant. The chief constable oDf Stamfor jutfe i conduct in refusing tc look after the thieves, who were probably within a few hundred yards of- his own house at the tiin he received inforatin o th buglay, y satig tat,inthus refusing hs aid,hewas onlyadheyrinbg toinstructionlaid diown for iythe town council, not to go beyond the J~o~ou. - -dry

As usual, Madame Goldschmidt appearedfive tiines; as usual, she began somewhat tamely, and warned- into enthusi3sm (and into realy great singing) as she progressedThe fist Piece-"Non mii dir," from Don Gioranniis not altogether suited to her. At any rate, although the slown movement was well and chraely delivered, the finale was by no means "up to the mark," b., no means what an audience "at a gunmea a-head" had a right to expect fromthe most "famoue' singer (except Malibran) since Catalani. It wanted point, it wanted fluency, and it wanted finish; while, for dramatic expression, it could not be compared With Mademoiselle Cravelhi's or Madame Viardot Garcia's execaution of the same movement at the Royal -Italian Opera. That Madame Gboldschmidt, when in the -ein, can sing (and has sung) "Non mi dif" as weul as any ono else, if not better, may readily be credited; but at the beginning of a concert she rarely seems to be in thorough command of her resources. The popular duet from Iossini's Turco in Italia (" Per piacer ala Signora"), in which she was joined by Signor F. Lablache, went off with much more spirit; and, notwithstanding that Madame Goldschmidt's readingwas to a degr anti-Italiaii (and consequently unorthodox), there asm an bandon, abrilliancy, and a certain persuasve originality about it, that we were by no means disposed to find fault. Therew2salsotheriscormica-notthe genuine Southern humour, but something, which, though odd, was entirely spontaneous, and not easyto be resisted. Why, by the way, does the accomplished Scandinavian never attempt the bravarU, songs of Rossini? They are surely as good a those of Bellin, Donizetti, &c.-and, what is more, they represent (in figare) that inexhaustible "old well" out of the depths of which nearly all the mnusical inspirations of modern Italy have been drawn. The scene-and-air of Alice, in Bobcct I4 Dieb.c-which occurs just before the innocent peasant-girl encounters Bertram near the precincts of the ruined abbey-has alvways been, is now, and must remain, so long as her voice shall endure, one of the capital efforts of Madame Goldschmnidt, not merely in an artisic but in a poetic sense, not merely in execution butin conception. With this true inspiration of Meyerbeer Jenny Lmnd first made the complete conquest of the English public, when (in 1847), young and a stranger, as Mr. Lumley's champion, she may be said to have stood, almost alone and wholy undaunted, against the unprecedented opposition in Covent-garden. Grisi, Mfario, Persiani, and Ronconi were the acknowledged chiefs ; the newly discovered Alboni, the most admirable modern representative of leitimnate Italian song, was in reserve; and the formidable Mr. Cost pioneer In the face of these, however, Jenny Lind succeeded, as all the world, or at least all the musical world, is aware; and the long notes, dying gradually into silence, with which she called for Raimbaut ("Rambaldo") were not only echoed from the mimic cavarns of the stage, but vibrated in the hearts of the public, and were there responded to with a unaimous sympathy, which if the gifted songstress has forgotten she mnst be the most ungrateful of her notoriously ungrateful tnbe. But that she has not forgotten it' we had a right to beoieve yesterday, when she emecuted the same scene by mneans of which she first made her triumphant appeal tothe densely-packed audience of Her Majesty's Theatre-an audience the more worthy of propitiating, since amongthem was the late composer, Mendelssohn, one of Jenny Lind's most ardent worshippers, who on that memorable occasion (he died not long after) made his iat appearance in a public theatre. If there was any difference in the Madame Goldschmidt of yesterday and the Jenny Lind of nine years ago it was in favour of the former. Such singing is not to be criticized, nor can any of the stereotyped epithets of eulogy suffice to render it justice. We shall, therefore, refrain from accumulating adjectives, satisfied with recording our sincere conviction that Meyerbeer, when composing his beautiful and characteristic music, could not possibly have dreamt of a morefaultless interpretation. The duet of the same composer, entitled- "La mere grande," one of his fugitive vocal pieces, with pianoforte accompaniment, was sung with the greatest effect by Mhdame Goldschmidt and Miss Dolby. This duet (ike everything Meyerbeer writes) is essentially dramatic; the cadences, though elaborately ornate, are in excelent keeping, and were warbled -with a neatness and purity of intonation as honourable to Mms Dolby as to her more renowned companion. To conClude, Madame Goldschmidt gave a beautiful (almost Mendelssohnian) song, by Mr. Benedict, called " My heart the iolian harp resemibles" (in which she was accompaniedlbythecomposer); andthe "InvitationtoDance"a "Dalecarlian melody, one of the wildest, most original and most delightful of those popular national tunes to which she is so passionately addicted. In this last Madame Goldschmidt was her own accompanyist; and "the voice a d the i;ArLout" ware = --b one as in the weli-iomwn similie of Shelley's Sensiivc PlanIt. Besidesthedaet, MissDolbygaveStradella'soldaria, "Oh, del mio dolce ardore." Mr. Swift, the tenor, sang Cherubini's " Ave Maria" (with Mr. Lazarus in the clarionet obbligato); and the first omanza of Manrico (VerdPs Trosztore) in such a manner (the "Ave Maria" more especially) as to justify the praise already bestowea upon the beauty of his voice and the geniality of his expression. Herr Otto Goldschmidt performedMendelssobn'ssecond pianoforte concerto, with orchestra (in D minor), one of the finest and most difficult ever written for the instrument; andThalberg's Tarentega, a very excellent thing in its way, though belongingtoan entirely different schooL Herr Goldschmidt's partiality for good music must always entitle him to the respect of connoisseurs. This is the fourth grand concerto-two of Beethoven and two of Mendelssohn-he has played in public. Mozart is still open to him-to say nothing of Dussek, Moscheles, lummel, and Sterndale Bennett. The band performed the overtures to Spobr's eTssonda and Weber's Elaryanthe-both masterpiece and in the same key-besides the march from A Mdtumnner Niges Dream. Mlr-Benedict conducted with his accustomed talent, and accompanied Madame Goldschmidt and Miss Dolby on thepianoforte in Meyerbeer's duet. A concert of sacred and miscellaneous music is announced by Madame Goldschmidt to be given at Exeter-hallvery shortly, the proceeds to be devoted to the "Nightingale Fund."
COVEXT-GADE.RW THEATE. Last night Mr. Balfe's popular opera of M7e Bohemsian GirZ was produced, for the purpose of introducing anew English tenor, Mr. Henry Haigh, in the part of Thaddeur. Mr. Haigh was vell received, and, indeed, made a very favourable impression. He has a good voice and a larg share of musical feeling. On the other hand, he has nmnch to learm as a singer, which, benhg evidently young, it depends upon himself to acquire The audience were not merely kcid, but disposed to regard everything from the best possible point of view. r. High received an encore in "gThe fairland of Poland," a double encore in " When other lips and other hearts," and was twice recalled afterthe fall of the curtain. Ee mnst not, however, attribate this success so much to his own excellence as to something in his voice and in his talent, which, while it enlisted sympathy, also appealed to indnlgence. He has qulities that 3ustify us in expecting much from him; and if he fils to make progress we shall be equally mistaken and dis- ap oted. )f tnhe rest of the perfor ance, if we except the Devilshoof of Mr. Farq n, which was spirited and effective, the less said the better.
SUDDEN ILLNESS OF MB. SEPJBANT WILKINS. - - _- I . . . _ Yesterday morning painful exdtement was occasioned among the members of tbhe bar and the profession generaly in the neighbourhood of the common law courts at Guild. hall, by the sudden and alarning illness of 3r. Seijeant Wilkdns-an illness which at one period it was feared would terminate fatally. The learned se jeant had been examining witnesses in a railway case in the Common Pleas, but was all at once seen to leave the court. He was scarcely able to stagger into the adjoining lobby, and then became quite exhausted, and vould have falluen but for the assistance of a nuber of gentlemen present. He was scarcely able to breathe, and was evidently suffering from spasmodic affection of the chest. Fortunately, a number of medical gentlemen vere present on the tril, and Mr. Stilton, of Guy's, Mr. Cocks, 3fr. Day, and others, promptly rendered every assistance. Stimulants and restoratives were administered, but with very little effect, and the sufferings of the learned serjeant for upwards of an hour were painful in the extreme; after the lapse of half-an-hour he was placed in a cab, when the fit was renewed, and it became evident to the medical gentlemen that to move him until he had rallied would be productive of extreme danger, but as soon as it was deemed safe the sufferer ws removed quietly to his chambers in King's Bench-walk, Temple. We are happy to state that, on maldng inquiries at a late hour las night, we were informed that the learned se4jeant was much better. _ _
I JRRDR OF A GiRL A2 SZYG2O'0. Yesterday two prisoners charged wifh the murder ol' a little -girl in'Lintou-street, ldington, -were examined xar Clerkenwell Police-coudt. They gave their -1 a._r Chales Somner, aged 29, an engraver, and Celestinb SEomer,;is wife, aged 25, and were charged on sUspicioiL Of causing the death of a girl,nme unlnown, but apps,. rently about 14 years of age, at their residenoe, No. 18, An. ton-street, in the paih of St. lary, Islington. TheeflrA. witness called was 1fr. uspectorHuaton, of theN division, who deposed a follows :-Yesterday afternoon, about half-past 4, in cons. sequence of infornitbin Irzceived, I proceeded, i comp' j of Sergeant Towvnshend,z23N,-to the houselNo;, l Lin- . ton-streef4lington, ~hen the door wasopened byai about 15yea'rsof age. We proceeded along the pasge,. and SaW the fuznale prisoner earning up the 3dtchen sta's. Whenshesaws Ehe said "Whatdoyouwant? saida, " W will tell you after we have lool;edinto your cellar." Shethxezsaid, " Good God, what do you want to do thlt for ?'- At. that moment the -iale prisoner came out of t3ie- wlqusr_' We then went down stairs and into the kitchen together., A light was obtained, and Sergeant Townshendirent into thecellar. Hecameoutshortly afterwardsandsaid "Itigt quite right, the body is there." I then went into the cellar, and found a child there, apparently about 14 years of !ae' withits ithroat cut in a very dreadful manner, and quite dead. Sergeant Townshend then took hold of the femaIf prisoner and said, " You maust consider yourself in mn custody on supicion of causing the death of this feinaei child." She said, "I did not do it. I know nothing about it. I heard something last night near the railing but didi not know -what it was." She then turned to her husb=a and said, " I did not say anything to you about the matter, in case it should make you timid." Both prisoners wera then conveyed to the station-house. The prisoners declined to say anything, or to ask t1ii witness any qaestion. SergeantEdward Townshend, 23 N, said,-I accompaniecT thi last witness to the house in question about 4 clock yesterday afternoon. At the time I did not know the pr,son6r?names. Weknockedaatthedoor, whichwascopenei by a little girl, and, upon asking the name of the prisoner-; we proceeded into the passage. I met the woman comi-ng upstairs, when I asked her if her name was Somner. She aid it was, and thea asked what we wanted there. At that moment the husband came out of the pArlour, and exclaimed, "What is it? What is it you want?' Ithen said "We should hlke to look into the cellar of your house." The woman said, "Look into my cellar? Gooi Good, what for?' I asked them to come down stairs with us. We then all proceeded to the kitchen, and, having procured a light from the servant girl, I went into the celar underneath the pavement, and there I saw a girl about 14 years of age, lying dead on her back. I saw blood, apparently clotted, on her throat. I then went into the kitchen, and, addressing the inspector, said, " It is quite right; the body is there." I then seized the femals prisoner by the wrist, and said, " You will cousider your. self in my custody for having caused thisgir's death." She said, "e Me? I did not do it; I know nothing about it.' After a short pause she said, " Oh, yes; I heard a noise outside the area railings last night ' and then, lookin_ towards her husband, she said, ' I did not tell you, dear,' as I thought it would make yon timid." Having procorecE a cab, I took both prisoners to the station. I afterwarvd went back tothehouse, andEmade a carefulsearchof the various rooms. On proceeding upstairs I went into the front room, which was used as a bedroom, and under thet bed I found an old black 'gown with spots of blood upon iv,' which appeared to have been partially washed out. I them went to the cellar with the surgeon, and found the doox spotted -with blood. There were also marks of blood ox the kitchen door, and on a lucifer-bcx. Upon making a. further search I discovered a spot of blood on the pillow ot the bed in which the servat slept. The male prisoner, when asked by Mr. COnTRe if he wished to ask the witness any questions, said, " No; it i5 notme; I saidatthestation-house that I did not khnov anything about it, andlagain say here that I know nothing about it." The woman, in answer to the same question, Eaid, " No, I don't." Rachael Mont, a little girl about 15 years of -age; deposed as follows:-I am a servant-girl, lving in the house Nro. 18, Linton-street, Isington. I went into the service on the 15th of last September. On Sitmr. day tight my mistress went out about 10 'clockr, but before she did so she came and said I was to go to bed. I did not go to bed, but sat up maldng myself anpziron.' That was in the kitchen. After my mistress had been out some time I heard the keyput into the street door, and them Ipat outthecandleand gotintobed. Iheaudmymistress comeinto the passage, and she had aperson with her. Sho came tothe top of the stairs and said, ";Are you abe4l. Eachacl? I made no answer. She then went up-stairs, and afterwards came down and drew the kitchen bhndt down. She thenleft the kitchen, and said to a little gir,' "Comedownhere." The girldid so, andthenmy mistresswent, into the cellar and told the girl to come to her, but the girl stopped at the kitchen door. listress said, "Come here; what are you afraid of l" Theyboth came into theidtcheun The girl thensaid, "Ilamnotafraid; butitis a strange place to me, I have not been here before." They them went out into the area, vhen the little girl said, " Soma one wants to cut my throat" whenu my mistress said,' "Suppose I was to cut it? The girl said, " Oh, yon are going tokill me," and then called out "urder." This sh caled out several times, and said, "The Devil wi taka you; the Devil wil take you; you wil kill me; yox wil kill me; I am dying; I am dying." The girl them made a horrid noise, as if she was breathing hard, and my mistress said "Hush," several times. My mistress then put; the candle out, came into the kitchen and walked up and! down in the dark several times, and said to herself " I Will kIll you I' She then got the lucifer-boa, lit the candle, andl went into the cellar again, and was there for some time, but I did not hear the girl speak again, and all was quiet. A, short time after this she came in, shut the door, and went upstairs. lly master was out at thxe time, but he cames home about 1 o'clock. He let himself in with a key. IE knew it was about 1 o'clock, because I didnot go to sleep for the rest of the night. I had seen the girl at the hous2 one Sunday evening before. That was about a month ago.' I knew it was the same girl because I opened the street door and heard my mistress tell the girl to wipe her feet andgo into theparlour. She wentinandimymistre3sanj the girl went out, and returned witha borwith three clasps, Whenmy mistress went out with the girl she had a larga stone withher, wrapped up in a piece of cloth. Mymistre3 toldme to go to bed on that night, but I refused, when shetookthegirl awaywith her, and told me to stopap until she returned. That was the only occasion lever saw the girl there. When my mistrss went out on Saturday evening shehadthe same dress on thatshenowhas, but; when shecameintothekitchenshe hadanold black drses on. Afterallwasquiet my mistress cameto my bedsidee and said she had been to marL-et ;that she had got change forhalfa crown, but that she would not pay me until Sunday. morning. By mistress then went up tobed, and! did nor. see her again that night. When she waS talking toame as my bedside she appeared to be very 'white and much agie tated. By Mr. Consr-MHy mistress also said in the kitchen,' while shewas walling about, "She wil not tell any more lies about me." Both prisouers declined to put any question to this wit* ness. Mr. George Coward, divisional surgeon, sida,- reside at No.6, St John's-terrace, NewNorth-road, Horton. On Sunday evening last at about 5 o'dclocl;, I was called uapon bvInspector Hutton to go to No. 18, Linton-street, and in a, coal-cellarlsawthe bodytof achildaboutl4yearsofag I: discovered three large wounds, from theback of the neck to thefront, embracingthewholeof theleftside.

Her right; side was very dirty, as if she had lain on her right side whilo thethroat was cut fromthefrontand then been pulled round. From the nature of the wounds, Iam satsfied they were infficted by some other person. She could not have done it herself. Sergeant George Besley, No. 12 N, said,-Between 6 and' 7 o7clock on Sunday evening I went to the house No. 18.

Lord I23)HURST repeated that the interval which had elapsed since the last meeting of the committee hac 'been too brief to allow of farther searches being made. Lord BROUGHAM had understood that those furthen -searches'would be completed by Thursday next. Lord LYIDHURST-was not in a position to pledge him self-to that-day.

That was one of th, obstructions-wlncdh'they hud met with in the prosecution o this inquiry. The LORD HAICELLOR declared that he heard th, circumstance mentioned by his noble and learned friend fe the first time. The late'Iaster of the Rolls, lord Langdale had certainly .always contended that tho officers of tha Court ought'not to hbe-distu±bed in the performance of thei ordinary duties without-eiqress- directions from their lord ships' House. lord BRCOUGHA-said,,no doubt the present Master o -the Rolls had taken theosameview as Lord Langdale. lord CAEb0RSLI was .-se there was no intention t( -throw the leaet4obetacle-in .theway of the inquiry from anu -ua3rter, a7nd he-should regret-ny delay, as it was desirabl -their lordships should comne to a' decision as quickly as pos -sible.

Lord BROUGHAM :said -that no one felt more strongll -than he did the great -expediency and necessity of expe diting this inquiry, and.of coming4o a conclusion one wa3 or the other withfiehileastpossibledelay- but it was quiti clear that the delay now required-to be interposed TM exceedingly important.; 'because if there had been no dela, his nobe and learned friend-wouldthave beua prepared ti vre notice of a motionL forThurEday. or Friday next. Thi q estion, therefore, wasvihetherthe discussion should tak pce on one of thoseedays,-or-be deferred till Mondaynext. 'The Earl of DERBY said, ifthis case was to be arguen as between the House and a court of law, he could under -stand -why the noble and learned lord - (the Lord Chan cellor) ahould not be willing to -afford any facilit in carry-.g it forward, but -,he thought it was not . -case to be taken up as between -two opposing parties.

If by that it was meant to ask hin vwlether in the argument that would ensue he shod4 urge -that nofurther search had been made, he vas preard at-snce to admit that it would not be at all necessary for isis argment to urge that point. For himselF, in duvBly,heshouldrequireno such search, butshould assnme, that the search had been made; but he had no power to bind other parties by suda an admission. He should be eemely glad to expedite the discussion. Nothing would be more inseemly or inconvenient than to interpos the least delay beyond what was absolutely necesSAry. Lord ClAMPlETL said, after that admission on the patt of the Lord Chancellor, he would strongly advise his noble and learned friend (Lord Lyndhurst) to close his tase, and to dispense with any iegative sarch. The IORD CHANCER OR observed that it must at the same time bc well known to noble lords on both sides of the House that there was a great number of grants and creations in modern times Ihear, hear), andhe would assume that their lordships vould aow that, and treat it as a matter of fact. (H1ear, hear.) He had that morning received a letter from the Deputy Keeper of the Rolls in Dublin, informing him thathe had a gmnt there for life only of so late a date as that of the reign of Philip and 3ary. He had promised to send a copy of it. The priesent case would not, therefore, amount toa negative search if it should turn out that there was such a grant; and it would be comPpetent togroduce it. After all, it would only amount to tbis that i ere was a precedent within 300 years instead of 400 years. Lord ST.LEONARD`S said, he betievedthe casereferred to by his noble and leamred friend related to the Irish peerage, and not to the English peerage. Lord A'BINGER called attention to a case which had occurred in the reign of Henry VIlL, in which the King granted a patent to the Abbot of Tavistclk to sit in this hoase as one of the lords spiritual. That patent had been declared invalid, and the question ws whether it had been inquired into by Parliament. As he understood that, upon the arst discussion on this subject, the jurisdiction of P?arliament to inquire into a point of this nature had been disputed, and the absolute power of the Crown to.confer a right to sitting-in this house had been maintained, the case l he had mentioned might be one of some importance, aud niight be worth referring to. It would be found in the 4tb book of Cokes Insitutes, page 45. Earl GREY asked if, after what had been said, there -war any obstacle to the course which the noble aud learned lord (Iyndhurst) originally intended to take-namely, to lay . on the table to-day the resolution he meant to move or Lord BROUGHAE thought that, in a matter of thif importance, it would be better to delay for a few days than to proceed with undue haste. Lord ABINGER looked upon the question under consideration as most important; it was, in his opinion, nthini less than the maintenance of the hereditary character of this House, which gave it a stability and permanence thai neither rank nor wealth nor any other quality could, he believed, confer upon it. The Earl of DERBY thought the House generally was disposed to adopt the coure which would most facilitate the proceedings, and at the same time not- expose them to the charge of neglecting duly to consider this uestion. In aD probability the further evidence to be prodced weouLd no1 have'verymateril bearing upon the case, and hewas in formeed that the gentleman who would be directed.to searcl for further precedents, and establish, if he might so say, the negative, would be enablea to make that search and preduce the result of his inquiry by 2 o'clock on Friday. Teir lordships had intended to proceed with the discussior on Thursday, bau perhaps the delay of a single day would tb ver rtanta* and he would, therefore, sest thai rthey shouLd meet ou iday to receive the additionall evi deuce and then proceed to the discussion of the question. his noble and learned friend would probably be able to giv -in ewichread by orthmcerowkthe tems of as f Eaows tio which he intended to move. Lord LYNDHandST.-Tcisnisiupon the assumption, and ,the very reasonable assumption, that the furher search fon :precedents wiELl not throw any additionalL light upon the question. (Hear, hear.) The noble and learned lord then handed in the resolution, which was read hy the clerk at the table, as follows - "The committee have, agreeably to your lordships' peorder,neaminred and considered the copy of the letters patent, purivring to create the Right Hion. Sir James Parke, Knight, a baron of the united kingdom for life; ad they report it as their opinLon that neither the said letters pateat nor the said letters patent with the usual writ of summons issued ia pursuance thereof can entitle thegraitee therein named to sit and vote in Parliament." Lord LYNDHUPS,T.-I shall propose this resolution ia the Committee of PrivilLeges on Friday nexct. Lord GLENELGsaid that in the discussiono pn this qaestion tho points raised were the les and the expediency or the coastitutional nature of this exercise of the prerogative. Nodw, itwasof the utmost importance thai I they should proceed with due de.iberation in conidering se grave a subject, and he therefore thought it would be very Lsatisactory, as there had been such a difference of opinion among high legalL authorities upon the question of legalLity, if they couldobtain the assistance of some of the learned judesHy prperled to fak the noble andtlearned lord whethe r he propsed to ask for that assistance, thongh he (lord Gleneg) would not have their lordwhips bound by the theopinion of any person if it was contrary to that entertained r bythemsteves? .lord LYNiDHUT.-I certainTy have no intenti;on whatevesr to cahL in the assistance of the judges.

Lord CAMPBELL said, if this were a question relating .to the consruction of en act of Parliament, they miight svery properly caLl for the opinions of the judges. Such was the question raised in the Brnndon case, and in the same r way, with regard to peerage cases which had tarned eUpof the effect of an attainder, and upon the descent, accordig tec dthe zules of the coamon lanw, the judges had been caled in Psto assista hut where the point involved depended entirelg upon the ferci conneetudo -Perliars^enSsi, those learned persons Lhad disclaimed jurisdiction, and had more than once isaid that they were not competent to give any ODinion. (Hear.] .In such cases they had referred to the Earl ?Jarshal, or te ,the Constable, or to the House of Lords, who were the sole judges of their own privileges. Considerable delay vk'ould also arise from calling in thle judges, and the matterEthen cou]Ld not possibly be decided until the very end of the present session of Parliament;* for the judges were about to set out on their several -circuits, and it wvould require a long timne for them to hear the case and give their opinions upon Lord ST. LEONARIYS said that in the Brandon case, to which, reference had been made, the judges attended in order to consider aud argue the point, 'hich turned upon the construction of the Act of Union -wth Sicotland. The question was punt whethaer the opinion of the judges should be taken and decided in the negative, and the House then proceeded to a decision upon the sub3ect withest the assistance of the judges. and, in hisopiruon, thtcaaosedrded a strong precedent against calling in the a6distance onf the judges in the present instance. lord BO31GEAU said, tat wha was stated by his noble and learned friend with respect to -the Brandon. case was perfectly.correct, hutie hehad oitted to mention the .sequel to that case.

'- B~~KRS.. The Earl of b ARDWIcd E observed that, upon the firs day of the session his noble friend (the Earle of en ough) had invitede- the GoverDnment to lay uPOn the table of the houseall the palers relating to the siege and capture of as. HI;s noble friend wsvery desirous that those paper should hiave beeni placed nlpon the table before the Secretary of State for iForeign Aairs took his departure for Paris; gan he understood the. Government to say that very probably they would be presented in time to peninit a discussiontotake place upon them before the Secretary of State departed. He was informed, however, that the Go. vernment had since stated to his noble friend that the pressure which was placed upon them to expedite-the mission of the Secretary of State to the Congress at Paris, and the necessity for his speedy departure, were such that they were afraid they cond not place the papers onthe table previously to the departure of the Secretary of State. He (the Earl of IHardwicke) might observe parenthetically, that, however great was the necessity for the speedy departure of the noble earl, it appeared that he would be the1ast to arrive of all the high functionaries whose duty called themn to the Congress. As the ilnportance of the question was very great, and he was exceeedhngl1 anxious to see the papers, he asked the noble earl the President of the Council to be good enough to state when they wonla be placed upon the table? Earl GRANVILLE said, that the question had better be addressed to the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whose attention had been particularly directed to the subject. As he (Earl GranviUle) was not aware that the guestion was to have been put to hin, lhe was not prepared, sn the absence of the Under-Secretary, with an answer. The Earl of tALAMESBURY asked the noble earl to urge upon the Under-Secretary the necessity of prodacing these papers as early possible. Ee WaS perfectly aware, from experience, what the 3abcours of the Foreign-office must be at this time, but there had lately been an additionof eight or3 10 gentlemen to the staff, who now assisted in performing the duties of the office. BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE. On the motion of Lord BnEDSDALx, the following resolutions were agreed to :-"That no private bill shall be read a second time after Tnesday, the 8th day of July next. That no bill confirnng any provisional order of the Board of Health or authorizing any enclosure of lands under special report of the Enclosure Commissioners for England and Wales, or for confinuing any scheme of the Charity Commissioners for England and Wales, shal be read a second tine after Tuesday, the 15th day of July next. That when a bil shall have passed this House vith amendments, these orders shall not apply to any new bill sent up from the Honse of Commons which the Chairman of CommitteeW shall report to the House is substantially the same as ths bill so amended." Lord REDESDALE said, their lordships were aware that he had in formner years proposed another resolation as to the time after which they would not take the second reading of public biUs. He regretted to say that last session the resolution in question vwas not adhered to as it ought to have been, several biUs the urgency of which was not such as to justifya departure fromthe resolution havingbeenbroughtin andpassedafter manynoblelordshadlefttown, assuming,asa matter of course, that the rule would be observed. If that resolutionwas tobeagain adopted by theirlordships, it ought to be on the distinct understanding that no public bills, unless they were of sufficient urgency should be taken into consideration after theperiod named in the resolution. The noble marquis oppoite assured him last year that he highly approved theorder, and thought it should be fairlyconstrued according to its terms. If that assurance were repeated now on the part of the Goverlnment, and if he felt that he. would not be misleading the House by asking it again to adopt the resolution, he should be happy to give notice to that effect; but otherwise he should not trouble their lordships on the subject. Earl GRAiTVILE thought the resolution referred to by the noblelord had done great good in expediting public bussnews in the House of Commons. But itwas mamfestiy impossible, with a due regard to thepublic interests, to lay down a rule which should in no instance be departed from. At the same time, he was most anxious to assist the noble lord in carrying the resolution into effect. Earl GREY said that, if their lordships did renew the resolution of last year, they were bound in justice to -their own character to adhere to it. He might remind them that a bill-important, indeed, but witheut even the pretext of urgency-for the permanent improvement of the law was brought into that house last session and passed through it with breathless haste, when it was utterly impossible to consider it, and when the House was in such a state that not one individual not holding some office in the Government or the household could be prevailed upon to vote with the MEnisters, and when, by a mere official majority, in a very thin House at the beginning of AuguAst, an important measure was passed into law. He alluded to the LImited Liability Bill. For his own part, he thought it so importxat that the Hoase should maintain its charadter b adhering to the resolution it had deiberately adopter that, at great inconvenience to himself, he came from a considerable distance in the country for the express purpose of endeavouring to persuade their lordship to stand by their regulation. It was represented to the Govermment that the subject of the bil was one of great importance, that few noble lords differed altogether from them as to the principle of the measure; that all admitted that the principle was one which, at all events, deserved tha utmost consideration; but that the law of partnership waa a question of all others requiring the greatest care and deliberation. It was pointed out that the bill, in passing ths other House, had not received that attention which its imnportance!demanded; that in the then state of this House, there being not a single day to spare, it would hava to be passed through its successive stages on consecutiva days, and that in those circumstances themeasure could not be consideredin amannerworthyits importance. These representations had no effect whatever upon the Government. The measure was pressed forward; the House sat on ona occasion till 2 o'clock in the morning; and a great many alterations were made which, suggested on the spur of the moment, could not all be of a beneficial character. He confessed that upon so difficult a subject it was far beyond his power to be able, in four or five hours, to form a positive opinion as to how the biU should be amended. But thebest proof that he and those who acted with him were right, and that the promoters of the bill were wrong, was to be found in the fact that already, at the g - of the session, the Government were introducing- a new bill to reWal the hasty legislation of last year (hear, hear),-a bill, too, founded upon very derent princples from that of last session even before it was amended. (sear, hear.) To show their lordships how littlo the latter bill received from the Government that consideration which its importance demanded, he might mention one curious circumstance. It was proposed in the other house to insert in the bill four or five clauses of great importance; Those clauses were opposed by the Government and rejected. fHear, hear.) In the bill of the present year those identical clauses, word for word (hear, hear), had been introduced by the Government themselves, and now stood part of the rmeasure under the consideration of the House of Commons. (Hear, hear.) Was thata proper and deliberate mode of carrying on the legislation of the country? (Hear.) Could anybody say that the permanent improvement of the law of parnershi, however important, was a measure of urgency He aditted its importance, but it would be trifling with the House to say that it was a matter of urgency that a law under which the commerce of the country had flourished for many years should be arended a few months sooner or later. (Hear, hear.)' He mentioned those circumstanuces because he thought that, if their lordships did not meanto adhere to the resolution against reading public bills a second time after a certain fixed period, it would be far better to abstain from pass'u it. If they intended to adhero to it in spirit and truth,he believed the resolution would be a most important one, and was persnaded that, if they steadilg refusedo taepmeasuressntoheatproweni Woold= impigosil to conisider them properly, the Govern- met and the other House would find some meansof bringing such bills before them in due time. (Hear, hear.) -Earl VRAINVLLE said, that he remiemibered only ohe bull-the Limited Liability Bil-which was urged upon their lordships last year after the time naTnedin the resolution.

PIRtACY - THE EASTER ARCHEEI AGO. * The Earl of AL2BEMLE rose to present a petition from the native and j>sropean merchants of -Singapore praying for protection to thb;!r -trade from. piracy, and to ask question of the Governmsss.' on thc' subect. With regard to the value of this trade, h.. might staet that in 185455 the imnports to F.ngapore, Pean, and MaaccaU aivni4e4.to tQOO,OOOz.,-and the exports to 4,25I,IQML, whlue the tonnage inwad. being of the same amount wie the tonnage o.nts!ards, weas 44 .orths.

But thi5was not U. The shen-of.wvar sent to the Easteri koLi- X pelaS to protect our own trade hi-aa the same defects which -mar ed those sent to the BalticJ to estroy the trade of -the enemy. They.were uttrly unfittedfor-the seas. they saile in, and (or the office on which they-were employed. They were generally frigates' and sloops.of war,: wth a . dep I draxght of water, -aud were therefore unabloe to prsue ; I light pirate vesel -that could run sat once;mtio. shoAl , water, and be' drawnm up in the 'rad an:vg the i bamboosthatlined-the.cist. (Hea'r,he2r.)' It pjseared, besides, that the instractions of the Lords GoDm:sioners of the Admixalty, according-to.the conktruction 'put o them by the naval officers at 'the various. trtiions prohibited them from e'therpmu a gordetainihg a. vessel except when ie the act of p tracy, which wes in effr?ct an immunsy fr,m - lin hment As -p the. East.bInetera. Cnnpany, c inwehse a n te protectinuof til settlements was placedhithe petitioners stated that they -had- no vessels whatever in those seas. Th e, most .fornldaqble piracies 'at the-present time were these of the Chinese.- .Trhese were.unknowv.n'a very fewr years ago, and they'i had growno0nti of the-rebo11ion mnthat country. .Thepirates having vessels better manned: and better .armned than the natives of the Archipelago, they, became roportionably -formidable to the :uropean; vessels of ord size, and large Chinese junks were in no danger from, butthe 7smaller class of junlis and the native craft generally fell an easy prey to, their attacks. Ah.part ~fror thle social. and moral obligtioBls whxichly upon us.to pu.down piracy, .we were bonnd by a convention wiith the Governmnent of the Neth1erlands, agreed to in 1824, to ta;e measures for its suppression in those seas. The Dutch had performed their duties honestly end faithfully. They had a flotilla of steamers and other *mall vessels which were constantly employed in the pursuit of pirates; but how opuld webe said io perform our part of the bargain when we :employed vessels wholly unfit for the purpose, and, morever, shack3ed.those we bad with conditions which made it impossible, for them to pursue a pirate unless caught in the act? He begged, therefore, to ask what-answer had been given to the memorial from the merchants of Singapore addressed to the Lords of the Admiralty in June, i855, on this subject? Earl GRA2TVLLE said, the Lords of the Admirlty had in the course of- last year received information to the effect that the pirates in those seas were doimg great Injury to trade.by meansi of the small boats which they employed, and that the ships sent out from this country were not of a description to deal with them effecttually. (Hear, hear.) Orders were accordingly sent out that a class of smaller vessels should be employed for that purpose. It appeared' that considerable difficulty had been experienced in finding the description of vessels reqired, in consequence of the great demand that e.isted or te exort of cavalry regiments from the East Indies to Egypt, but at the last ac-counts the admiral on the station had been able to detach one steamer for the pirate service, and arrangements were being made for the adoption of more rigorous measures. (Hear, hear.) On the motion of the. Earl of BEssionoRaur, a return was ordered of-all persons who had qualified to act as justices of the peace in the several counties in England .and Wales, and of the number of petty sessional divisions in each county, the number of parishes comprised in each division, and the number of magistrates usually acting therein. The Tril of Offences Bill, the Vice-President of the Committee of Council on Education, Bill, the House of Commons Offices Bil, and the Metropolitan Police Bill passed through committee, and were reported without amendment to the House. Their lordships adjoured at 10 minutes to 6 o'cloek.

TIIE ATl;TACK ON THE BEDIA. Mr. LAYARD askedthe Under-Secretary for War, why the list of officers reconnnended by General Simpson for promotion for distinguished services ii the attack on the Redan, on the 5th of September, alluded to in the Gazette of the oth of' October last, had not yet been published, and whetherit was the intention of the Secretary of State for War to publish that document? Mr. PEEL said, he had not been able to answer this question the other night beeause no previous notice was given of it ;but hehad since ascertainedthatwhenitbecame known in this country that the siege had terminated, and that Sebastopol was taken, Lord Hardinge wrote to General Simpson, requesting him to send home a lisb of officers whom he would recoammend for brevet rank, as well of those who bad distinguished themselves in the attack on the edan, as of those who had, from the begining of the siege to its close, been conspicuous for zeal and gallantsy. It was in the expectation of receiving such a list that this note ws appended to the despatch to which the hon. gentleman adverted the other night, but no such list had been received; for General Simpson had taken a different course, and had sent home the whole return which he received from, the staf from the heads of departments, from general officers commnnding divisions, and from the commanding officers of regiments, of those persons under their respective commands the officers first named thought deserving of mention. General Simpson said that, in preference to making a selection from the lists himself, he sent them home for the gidance of lord Hardinge, and preferred that Lord Hardinge should make out the list of officers most worthy of being rewarded. The result was the brevet of the 2d of November. The returns were not such as wxre usually published in the Gaz-ett, not being returns of officers named for brevet rank, but they were in the office of Lord Hardinge, and could be referred to in case it should be to the advantage of any oficer concerned to do so. Mr. LA-YARD inquired whether it was not intended to publish the list of those officers who had distinguihed themselvesintheattack-ontheRedan? - Mr. PEEL replied that General Simpson had sent over no other list than that he had just described. STAFF OF THE AP=,rY. 3Mr. EWART inquired of the Under-Secretary for War whether any measures were in the contemplationof the Government for the eicdent reform of the Staff of the British army, so as to make-it a nucleus of the best and most intelligent officers thereof, who should receive their appointments on the ground of merit only? - I Mr. PEEL said, that the question of requiring some test of merit before officers were placed on the Staff had been. under consideration, but nothing was dedded or agreed to yet. DUBLIN IOSPITALS. Mr. GROGAN asked the hon. gentleman the Secretary to the Treasury if he could inform tbe Reoec -when the s-eot vr the commission appointed last session to inquire into the Dubibn hospitals would be presented? Mr. WIISON replied that the report w in course of preparation, and would very shortly be laid upon the EXAMINATION OF CIVIL SERVATS. Lord GODERICH begged to ask the right hon. gentle-man the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether the Civil Service Commissioners were about to Present a report upon the quliications and examination of applicants for civil appointments ? The CHANCELLOR of the EX}C EQUER said that the commissioners were preparing such a report; it w3s in a state of great forwardness, and would, he expected, shortly be presented, and laid before Parliament. APPO MENTS IN THE FOREIGN.OFFICE. Lord PALMERSITON laid upon the table a copy of correspondenco on the exa-ination of persons appointed to situations in the Foreign-office. COURT OF CHANCERY (IRELAND) BIIL. On the order of the day, for the second reading of this bill, Mr. S. FITZGERAILD, after presenting a petition against it from the inoorporated Solicitors of Ireand, rose to move that the bill should be read a second time that day six months. HIe regretted that the opposition to this measure had not been undertaken by some one of greater legal standing, but jusified the course which he had adopted, on the ground that the measure was founded upon the abolition of the Encumbered Estates Court. For a similar reason he could not sunport the measures of the hon. and learned gentleman, the member for Enni.kldlen ( Vr Whiteside), on the same subject; and, must therefore, look for support to those members on both sides of the house who ' witnessed with pleasure the progress in material prosperity which Ireland had recently made,-and who attributed much ofthatyrosperity to the successful operation of the court which it was now proposed to abolish. The position of the hon. andlearnedSolicitor-Generalwas, inhis oponion, amost extraordinaryone. Hehadpasseda studied but well merited eulogium upon the manner in which the Encumbered Estates Court had worked, and concluded by askdng the Hrouse summarily to extinguish this court, and to transfer its jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery, which it appeared, upon the face of his own bill, he beheved needed that its expenses should be diminished, its proceedings amended, and its jurisdiction and powers increased. If he had taken an opposite course and had proposed to transfer to the court which he had pr3isedsomce porthonof the jurisdiction of that which he said needed reform, his conduct would at least have been consistent; but when he praised one court and then asked that it should be extinguished, when he said that another needed reform and asked that business might be transferred to it. he asked that to which he (Mxr. Fitz- the House would not assent. The bill pro- founded upon the report of the commissior appinted to inquire into the Encumbered Estates Cu. e(Mr. Fitzgerald) thought that it -vas much to be regretted that that commission was conposed entirely of lawhyeis That opinion was founded upon no want of respect for the learned profession of which ho had once been a member, but simply upon a consideration of the duties wthich the commision had to -iwchadge. It was appointed to inquire into a court the jurisdiction and proceedmgs of which were quite uenusual and exce tional. wtvas scarcely possible to imagine any systemeof lega admi. nmstration more foreign to &heideas and associations or more completely alien to tho ha.bits of lawyers who had been accustomed to practice in the old tribuals- than the particular system ito which it was the duty of the comrmissioners to inquire. For this reason, and for many others, itwas much to be wished that the commission had not been made to consist exclusively of lawyers, and of lawyers, too, accustomed to practis in the Court of Chancery. It woul:l have been exceedingly desirable to have bed in the commiscsion a few eminent civilians, as was the case when as Government inquiry was instituted some years smice into the proeedifngs of fhe Couarto Chancery in England. The commission appointed on that occasion was originally composed of lawyers otly, bht, in compliance wiith the prayer of an address to the Crown on the subject, there were added two distinguished civilians the rght hon. baronet the member for Carlisle (SirJ Graham3 and the right hon. member' for Oxfordshire (Mr Henley); anditwas well knwng that to those gentlemen the commoners were idebted notonlyfor most zealous cooperationinteprosecntion of theirlabours, bt also forsote of the most valuable recommendations contined in their report. (Hear, hear.) -With this excellent precedent before them, he conld not help thinksing th thtee public would havebad greater confidence in the esent report if-it, like that to which he hied alluded; had emanated- fFm a commissionl not exclusively composed of lawyers.: It was worthy of remark that, though one of the topics of inquiry assignedX to: the commissioners, wvas wvhether the jurisdictioni of tels Encumbered Estates Court shouald be transferzed to the Court of Chancery, or the -former tribunal - be' continued for a limited period, no expressibw"of opinion on *this pointi was elicited from any of -the persons to whom queries vwere -addressed. by the°omurissioners.

Moreover, whiler entirely acquitting the Iish Soliitor-General of the leasf desire to perpetrate a ob, he thouht it right to say that there were in this oill certain proviions with respect to -officeswtowhich the attention of the House ougbt to :be directed. They were aware there were too many instances in Ireland 'where men in the full vigour of their powena were removed from offices and hid pensions assigned to them, that the duties heretofore discharged by theta might be performed, under a different name e other persons. It would be invidious in him to name individual i4stanoes of thiskind ; but certainly, whether they looDedtothePo5st office, the Board of Works, the Poor-lavw Board, or any other public department in Ireland, they would fnd the examples of what hehad stated so numerou as to render it. high -time that the attentionof that House was directed tcw the subject. The hon. and learned gentleman, in introducig this mesure, said thatit would ultimately effect a considerable saving of' expense to the country; yet he was. obliged at the sne timeto admit that, in consequence of tha burden of compenSationwitchitwouldl tawlfor persons who weretobepensionedin the full fgor andrmeiof life, there would be nol present saving of eepense whatever. - Itn might, indeed, happenlthat f portion of the staff of the Encumbered Estates Cout would be employed in the new Coast of Chancery. Still this bill would pension Thef masters, notwithsto.nding that their funutiona were vrtuly those of vice-chancellors; and it also containeda provisico. rendering nobody eligible for the office of vice-chancellor who had not acted as a practismg baxrister for 15 yearsrestriction.wihich would have the effect of forcing Mr. Aim missionerHargreaveintoinvoluntaryinactivity.to donbtthe hon. and learned gentleman woul place great reliance on that part of his measure which conferred on the Court of Chancery the power of giving an indefeasible rarliamnentary title to every estate sold i that cost. Certainly it might appear unfair that the advantage of such a title should be enjoyed by the owner of an encumbered estate forced into thatco,while itwasdenied to theunencumbered proprietor who went before that tribunal voluntarily; buv-it should be remembered that t;hi;s was hnt a very smlall pa.rt. of a very great quesion ; and, inasmuch s the comnise sioners ppointedtoinquire into the registration of titles i England and Irand had not yet made their report, it wouldc be most unwise for the friends of a comprehensive refornm on this subject to sanction the premature introduction int -Ireland piecemeal of an exceptional system of legislation. The Master of the Rolls was adverse to this part of the hior. and learned gentlemian's scheme, and thougPht it ough to be postponed till the report of the comssioners above referred to had been presented. This bill also proposed to establish a court of appeal; but that provision, howvever encelleutinitself, wras :notsufficienttoinduce the lIonseto addp a measure contaiing so many objectional e details. regard to the present Encumbered Estates Cort which i§ was proposed to abolisb, nogreat social change demauded by an imperative political necessity couid be carried out without incidentallv workiIng some personal hardships but the operations of that tribunal had unquestionably, in the main, proved most beneficialto Ireland, and, if it were continel with an increased staff, and removedto a more convenient. sitation, it would, doubtless, be capable of confe - still further advantages on that country.

If the 1ouse eonsidered that the proceedings of that Court had hitherto been bteneficial t Ireland and wrere likely tobe so infuture, he asled them, to snpport the amendment he begged to move-that the bil' mrea a second thme that day p es months. c - ld. POLLARED-'URQUHART, in seconlding the amendment, expressed his opinion that the establishment oF Thek Encumbered Estates Court had effected a great improvement in the social condition of Ireand. Eormerly the get majority of the landed proprietors of that country were alienated from the mass of the people by religions and political differences, and many of them were involved in sch hopeless embaraments that they were uble to rendertheir property beneficial to themselves or to discharge theirduties to those with whom the possession of such property broughtthem into cornexion. These evils, which had beenm groin for many years, were brought to a climax in 186and he believed that, if the diflculty had not been solved. by the establishment of the Encumbered Estates Court, manylish proprietors, wrho were nowin comparatively good. ircunstaries, would have been weighed downbythe calai.- ties which visited the country. It was becausehe wished to. avoid the recurrence of such a crisis that he urged they HIouse not to interrupt the presentarragement, or to interfere in such a manner asto throwv difficulties in. the way o£' the free transfer of lauded property. Mr. DEASY supported the bill, because he believed itsa tendency would be to faeilitate the transfer of land. The. measure appeared to him to involve three importantprin- iples-first, the perpetuation of the powrers now vested in and exercised by the Commssqioners of the Encumbered Estates Ceurt; secondly, the trensfer of those powrers to' the Court of Chancery; and, thirdly, the internal reform of the Court of Chancery itself, by the abolition of the office of masters, and the substitution of new judges who should. unitein themselves the functions of judges and nasters. With regard to the first of theseprinciples, hethought therze was no difference of opinion between the mover and seconderof the amendment and hiraself, and he believed that publc, opinion was almost unanimous on the subject. Experience had shown that the high powers intrusted to the lEncumbered Estates Court mightbe vested ina judicial tribunal with great advantage to the country aud with perfect safety to individal rights, tInder the anthority or that court, property of the value of 14,000,000!., and yielding an income of nearly 1,500,004 a-year, ha, been transferred, with a Parliamentary title, tonew propri etors The qestEon the House hadto determine was, in what macmer the powers thus exercised should berpe. tated,and the present hbill proposed to transfer such powers to the judges of the Courtof XChancery. The onlvy lternative he had heard suggested was the prolongation of the ex. istence of the Enucmbered Estates Court; but it must 1 remembered that that was an exceptional tribunal, established to deal with a particular emergency, and invested with stringent and arbitrary powers, which it was intende should be exercised only for a temporay andlimitedperiod. As an administrative tribunal, that Court had been eminently successfal, but he denied that its working; as a judicial tribunal, had been equally satisfactor7 As a judicial tribunaL it was not calculated to afford sati faction. Its mahinery was too complicated for that pur pose, and it was by n.o meass for the mterest of the pnI that. it should be perpetuated. The Court of Chan possessed every facility for undertaking its business, a there Ws no reason why the trausfer should not be at on effected. Thehon.membcrwhomovedtheamendmentseem to be rather prejudiced against the name-of Chaneery (bea hear) but It must be r.emembered that the Court Chancery wvas not what it was; it3 mode of procedure had been completely changed, and he was convinoed that the important business-connected with the transfer of pr onety no done in thte Encumbered Estates Coulrt, could1 extremely unwise to leave two tribunals standin of a ordinate and co-extensive jurisdiction The retvoul be, that they would become rivals and would be bidders on atamst the other for busiess. He hoped the Hene woul alowvthehS togo into committee, where, whatever defec there mightbe in its machinery-, and he could not say1 approved of ill of it, could be remedied. The hon.a learned member forEunismdilen had a bil on the-paper fc to-nziht on-this subject, but the -hon. and learned mnembe would scarcely go so far, he thought, as to reject this b simply becauseit differedfrom his own in somue of its de As to the unsatisfactory character of the machinery whi had been so much dwelt apon, that. was hardly a questio forthe present occasion. He agreed that at tresent tb machinery proposed by the bill wams nnsatisfadiory; thtwas a mnatter which could be remedlied in commi It was quite true that if the arrears of the Eneumk *Estates Cour were transferred to the Cour of Chancery, would be impossible for the latter tribunal in its prese condition to dispose of these arears,sand at the smie . to proceed with its current busin ess. But that difficulty no reason for refusing to read the bill a second timue. - 'I might be found means by which the Court of Chun could be rendered equii to the new duties prop to be imposed %uon it, either by increasing the or otherwise; but that vas a subject for. c sideration in committee.

In saying that he did not mean to imply that he had not sufficient confidence in Her Maeets Irish law officers to induce him to assent to the second readirg. The bill was founded upon the report of a vcommission, and due deference should be paid to the recomanendations of such learned persons, and to the endeaovours of the law officers of the Crown to act upon that report for the irrprovesnent:of the law in Ireland. But the working of the Encumbered EAstes Court had been highly neficil -almost uni-versal testimony was borne to the excellent results wbich had followedits constitution, and having had tonie accidental experience of the administration of property in the Iinsh Court of Chancery, and also a greait deal of e.esience of such matters in the English Court of Chancery, he thought the House sholuld hesitate before removing the administration of landed property from a court which had hitherto been so atisactorilyconducted backaain totheeCourtof Chancery. They had heard of reforms about to he adopted in the Court of Chancery, .and ho should have been much more satisfied if he had also heard that those reforms had been carried into execution, which might have justified the confidence of the public in the transference of the duties of the Encumbered 3Estates Comnissioners to that court. The best course, in his opinion, would have been to see that those reforms had b£en eflected, and then to have provided that under its new administration it shouIdbe requared to discharge the additional bhsiness that ws proposed to he thrown upon it. No complaint had been made in any quarter against the Encmubered Estates Court. It had disposed of in immense qnantitv of business in the most satisfactory manner.

So faras a judgmentconld be formed from ,the statements containedin the usual sources of information teyhad every reason to Wieve that the people of Ireland 3ma been as much satisfied, generally, with the proceedings 4of that court as the public of England. He had not the least objection to the second reading of the bill, but l-e hoped the House would watch the measure very vigilantly. Another matter ir-connexion vwith this subject was the expense attendant upon the transfer of duties from one court to another, involving the extinction of the functions -of one of such courts. Pensions would have to be &ranted to those functlionaries whose duties would cease, tehile new Dfficesatconsiderable expense wouldbocreated. Without iavir.g any personal interest inthe matter, he had thouht it his duty as an independent member of Parliament, afer laving paid great attention to the subject, to trouble the House with the few remares he had made, in the hope that they would watch the progress of the bill with that attention which its importance required. Mrr. THIESTDE said,the observations of the right hon. -entleman who had just addressed the House were entitled to-consideration, but it struck him tht the speech of the Cight bon, gentleman fcurished arguments aganrst the vote whih hewas about to give. This wtas a question which eughttobe watched with the clo est jealousy, beth with t ezrd to its financial bearing, and with reoard to the good which it was eaIculated to do for rheland. He conscien- sosy believed that this bill was impracticable in its siecution through the medium of the Court of -hancery. lThat coutrt could not perform the work at was preposed to transfer to its jurisdiction. Since ieilast adteat the Eouse on the subject he had been .o Ireltid, and had asked the opinions of a great number of members of his own profession as to the nature of the bil.

On the contrary, when he asked thimpnhether the Court of Chmncerv could transact the an-ears of business proposed to be transferred to it,they nnanimously ansvered that it was impossibie. Be understood from experienced -oEcitors, that the number of estates at present for sale in Sfhe Encumbered Estates Court was 1,000, involvino a pro- wrty to the amount of 16,000,0007. or 17,000,000?. in v gaue there wsere 3,o0,000?. non to he distributed, the right to -hich money wat yetsto be ascertained byEthe court.

Butwhile their decisions in respeatd to the sale and t-ansferof landed property isadbeenmnostsstisfactory,it was well known that their deei-sions with regard tothe appropriationof the fnndssorealized bad not been satisfactory. the object to be attained was the -combination of these two functions-the disposition of the lan and ti e distrbution of the money. It was the opinion of the solicitors as a body (and their opinion was very nseful, for they were a highly pratica body of men), that the bil would net work, and that the business could not he doner f itwere put in Chancery.

He saiy , that the wuork proposed tobe t<raLfesrecd to the Court ot Chancery was more than it was possible for that COurt to do. fe observed that before any trausfer of lfauded property could take place in Iroland bytmeans of the eourthoa Chnucery, the abredtct of title must be thoroughly inWiected; and, as those abstracts were -often yes-v inaccurate, it wrould create the necessity of an inspection of the title-dees themsrelves; and he invited the lord Chancelor to ask the ieaster of the Rolls of Engoland rhat onerous duty that would involve. Such being the duates that would beimposed upon the Court of Chancery, lhe felt that the arrears of husiness would be so great that -they could not be performed, and he therefore felt that he -ould not accede to the arranoeent. The eastern of the tolls also gave his opiuion about the machinery by which -this additonal busess was to be transacted.

These would have to perform bosiness whichrwasdnowadisposedof bycnine judfi-s -nanme!y. the Lord Chancellor, the Ma3ster of the Ito5 foul llaisers in Chancery, and the three judges of the En cumberecd Es.tates Court.

WVhat the Ma^ster of the Rolls said wYa-, "Give us work wrhich we are able to do, and we reready to undertake it " but to begin by thcrowinlg four years' arrears into the court ws to destroy at -Once the whole efficidency of the coulrt and to neutralize -all the advantages proposed by this measure. He would ask the hon. and learned mem ber for Cork whether this .wss matter of detail ? WYas it matter of detail to do away with a cou.rt which dealt wvith property to the extent of -20,000.000?. in value? It was not just to imnpose upon the House the duty of putting into shape a measure -of reforml, which ought to be done bya select COlnmittee. Mie Encumbered Estates Conammssseners recommended that {he iatamr and fees upon all proceedings in Chancery should bie abelished or reduced, and on a previcous occasion he bad vzoted from a return published wvhich showred that the fees paid in the County Gourts amuounted to 200,000t. a-year. Rowr, I:e w anted to know, if this principle wvere adopted for Ireland,whether they were gelsg to ac upon it universaly He doubted very much whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer would be prepared to sanction the applcation of such a principle to England But his strong objection to the biU was, that it v.-as a job-the biggest job, ule believed, which had been laid apon the table of that house for a quarter of a century. TWo Vicehancellors were to lbe apated, and si chief clerlcs were to be attached -to the Master of the Rolls and tho Viee-Chan. Cellors, with salaies of 1,250?. each, which would very aeon be increaed. Then there were to be six junior clerks; and how were these officers to be appointed? The commissioners properly recommwended thatthe judges ahould have the appointment since those persons would be respon. aible for the due execution of the duties of thoeeundeniheir authority- and the bill introdued last session br the Solictor-ieneral for Ireland adopted this recommendation rhich was in accordance with e established practice in Egland. To hi infinite surprie, however, the present bil ook the entire of these appoinentsfrom the udges, and p)laced them in the hands of the Lord lieutenant. 2Now, he looked upon this as a joh. The offcers of the Court of Chancery, who were perfectly able aill to worki but were to be thrust aeide by this mear, wrere to be turned over to the tender mnerciee of the Secretary of the Tresury, and that gentlman would, no doubt, eut down their pensions to te lowedt poenbb POit, while good salaries would be gwen to friends oftheAdminitiou, -who would be iffed into the appointweat oreted der tih bilL He aked He hetherancha proposition was r ful to the judges, or was in iteelf rea able a iust?

The latter staff had no claim for compensation if their places were abolished; the Court of Chancery, on the otherhand, had a claim for compensation and, therefore, it seemed the Treasury was to-be burdened'by pensioningoff one set of officers and sppointing another who could not dischae their duties so velL It was proposed now to make the Cotrt of Chancery the great conveysneing machine for the whole of Ireland; so that wihereas at present a man mig-ht sell his estate if encumbered, he might hereafter go to theoCourt of Chancery, owing no debts, and at the expense of the State have his estate conveyed Sor him to somne other person. It would be impossible for the Court of Chancery properly to conduct its business if to that court were transferred not only all the arrears of the Encumbered Estates Court, but also a11 the conveyancing business of Ireland, and be believed that the vast majority of the professon in Ireland looled upon the scheme before the Hose as impssible to be carried into execution. Why should Ireland be legislated for on different princples to those which obtained in legislating for England. The Solictor-General, he believed, had a bill which he intended to introduco upon the transfer of land in England, and yet the Hous as now asked to rashly adopt for Lreland a principle founded, it wazs true, upon a portion of the report of a comission but the enidence taken with regard to that portion of the reprt was worth positivey nothing. Theprincipbeonce admitted, thatthe Court of Chancery should tund'ertake the whole of the conveysneing business of the country, where could it end?- Why should not the court undertake to settle the affairs of all the mercantile ,portion of the community? He thought that the suggestion was very dou'otfl indeed that persons encumbered their estates 3olely for the pleasure of selling them in the Encumbered Estates Court; but he implored the House not to consent to apply a new principle unless they were willing to apply it to England also. As to the great question of the expediencyof establishing a system by whichlandcouldbe transferred as easilyas stock-, lettbat beconsideredbyitslf; but he hoped that now, when every day the differences between England and Ireland were dwindling away, the House would not consent to establish one system in Ireland and a different one in England. The present bin would not affect only encumbered estates, but a person being only tenant for life, and owing no money, might, by evading the vigilance of the court-a thing which under the press of business wfhich would arise would not be im vible-transfer property which he had no right to transfer, and give to the purchaser an indefeasible title. If the Government persevered in pressing the bill toa second reading, he had no alternative but to record his vote against it from a conscientious conviction that it would plunge beth tribunals into confusion, and that it would be impossible to bring it into practical operation. Mr. Serjeant O'BRIEN considered that the objections which had been utged against the bin were applicable only to some of its details, while the principle of it was entitled to the favourable consideration of the House. If the principle of giving a Parliamentary title, which had already produced such good effect were to be continued; it mnst be extended to unencumbered estates, for, if it were not, the owner of anunencumbered estate was pLaced in an unfavourable position as compared with the owner of encumbered property, because, in the case of two estates of equal size and equal valne as regarded Productiveness and locality, the one 'wshich could be sold with a Parliamentary title would bring two or three years' purchase more than the other. He doubtedwhether the immediate abolition of theEncumbered Estates Court would be beneficial to the public in Ireland. The question was whether the powerof givinga Parliamentary title ought not to be continued and extended? It had been said that the Court of Chancery in Ireland had so bad a reputation that Parliament ought not to gve it new powvers. But was it to be proposed that the Irish Court of Chancery should be abolished altogether2 The bill in many respects only carried out the principles of recent Chancery reform in England, since it proposed to abolish the office of master, and to appoint a new vice-chancellor. He would admit that if 'he arrears of the present Encumbered Estates Court were all at once thrown the Vice-Chancellors, it was impossible they could get through them. (Opposition cheers.) But this was a matter of detail, which could be considered in committee. Only 372 petitions were presented in 1854, so that the number of estates brought into the coiut had diminished, and he believed, that if the arrears were disposed of, the new tribunal wonld be enabled to e-xecute the duties thrown upon it by this bilL At present, the same property was sometimes at the same tine in the hands of thetwo courtsa state of things which could not be said to be beneficial to the landed gentry of Ireland. He was unable to see any remeny for this evil, except the establishment of the prindip tt there should be one court and one tribunal, 'which should have the power of sllingthe property and deciding upon all matters connected with it. The binl had the unanimous support of the commissioners, including, among them, the Master of the BeoUs and Dr. Longfield, and as it only continued and extended principles which had already been adoptedwith success, he should give the measure his support. Mr. GEORGE agreed that this questioLwas not of a party nature. There was one principle common to the biUs of the Solicitor-General for Ireland and of his hon. and learned friend the member for Enniskinlen (Mr. Whiteside). It was that the time had arrived to transfer the jurisdiction of the Enoumbered Estates Court to the Court of Chancery. But whereas the Solicitor-General also wished the arreanrs of that tribunal to be transferred to Chancery, his hon. end learned friend made the wiser proposition of allowing them to be swept off by the commissioners. He thought the Court of Chancary ought not to be allowed to sellunencnnbered estates, but that theirjurisdiction ought to be limited in the same manner as that of the old tribunaL He also thought it would be improper and unjust to create new officers instead of makig use of the present' staff of Masters in Chancery-gentlemen who were perfectly competent to perform the duties which would devolve upon them. There could be no doubt i that a court of appeal ought to be established, to save suitors from the expense of an appeal to the House of Lords; but it ought to consist of two judges besides the Lord Chancelor, and an appeal ought to be given from the Lord Chancelor as well as from the Vice-Chancellors. If the Government would consent to refer this binl, to-ether vith the bils of the hon. and learned member for inniskilen to a select committee, he should vote for the second reading, but if that course were not taken he should feel bound to oppose it. Colonel DUNNE was one of those wvho originally opposed the institution of the Encumbered Estates Court, and experience convinced him that he was right. No one could deny but that frauds had been most frequent under it, and creditors had been injuriously affected by the sale of property in a glutted market. He intended to vote against the present bill, not because he wished for the continuance of the Encumbered Estates Court, but because he wished to put a stop to such legislation. It was not correct to say that it necessarily did away with encumbered estates, for the new purchasers might immediately encumber the property. He would not admit that expediency was anyreason for passingthe present bill Expedienha gt theountr into a war; expediency had carried the contry through it with disgrace, and expediency was now leading the country to a disgraceful peace. It was absurd for the C-overwnentto talk of administrative reform when they now proposed to remove, with compensation. a number of men fuRy competent for the discharge of their duties, and put in their places others who, when the Encumbered Estates Court was first formed, were told that they had no right to compensation. A portion of the provisions of the present biU would enable the Court of Chancery to seU settled estates, and there was no power to prevent injustice being done under it. These were his reasons for opposing the bill; for he believed that the Encumbered Estates Court would have died a natural death when the period for 'which it now existed by law terminated. He would cordialy support any motion for the imrovement of the proceedings of the Court of Chancery, for he did not desire that litigation should be either tedious or expensive; but the transference to the Court of Chancery of the powers of the Encumnbered Estates Court would not, in his opinion, be any improvement, and in opposing the p resent bin he acted in accordanco with the wishes of many landowvners in Ireland. The hen, member for MSanchester on aformer occasion expressed satisfaction at the introduction of English capital into Ireland, but he was happy to say that there had not been that inundation of English caDital wvhich was hoped for by some. There were men in Ireland 'with large capital who had purchased the sold estates, and he, for one, wished thatIrishmen should bothe possessors of the property. He would ask whether the proceedings i respect to the sale of these estates had resulted beneficially forthetenais 'What was the cause of the murders that had taken place,-Of Miss Hinds and others? 'he=new proprietorsofcours wished to make the most of their money; and they exercised rather harshly their rights vn expelling the tenants and clearing their estates. Mr. BLAND supported the second reading of the bilL It was admitted that the jurisdiction of the Encumbered Estates Court, which under peculiar circumstances had operatedbeneficially, should at some tine be terminated, and he thought the time had arrived when the business of the Encumbered Estates Court might be transferred to a reformed Court of Chancery. The reason given by the hon. member for Wexford for opposing the present bill ww one of detail, and in committee he shoald concur to a certain extent with the hon. member, for he thought it would be impossible, if the a ears now exjstin- in the Encumbered Estates Conrt were at once introduced into the newly contituted Vice-Chancelore' Courts, that it could be got through, together with the other current business, with the staff proposed. He therefore thought that the Encumbered Estates Court should be allowed to continue to wind up the business now before it. He also thought it essential that a reformi, similar to tbat which had taken place in the Epglish Court of Chancery, should be effected in the Irish court. It had been sad thatthe Vice-Chancellorsshould be hosen from the masters, and admitting that they were gentlemen of Dreatf allity and experience,. stin he thought that that. a matter which ought to be left to the responsp ity oE (lreanment, and wrhich -it was not the oco or.duty..of Parliament. to determine. T.he ElleUm- bered Estates Court wvas one which had been tug-; gestged lby the emergency of the timse; it b ad pruie well the work hich had been expected from it; but he apprehended that no law er lDould recomaend thxt it sfiould be perpetuaxted. no approved -the principle of the bill before the House, and he was readY to go into the de- tail with the same sprint 'of ipitial just ce with whichhe was prepred to exaina the competing measur roposed by the hon. and learned member for Enniskllen.

Br. )I'MAHOX urged that there was nothing of greater importance to the people of Ireland in the ae gate than that they should be- ablo to obtain aid at as cheap rate as posble. He could not sunport the measure before the House, because it would transfier to the Court of Chancery, which had already a great deal to do, the unconstitutional and unusual powers which had been hitherto exercised by the Encumbered Estates Court; and he for one, infinitely preferred,- when unconstitutional and exceptional powers were grsanted to ay tribunal, that they should be conferred upon an extraordinary rather thanupnA an ordinary court of the country. lIe trusted that the Government would direct their attention to the removal of the obstacles wvich impeded the transfer of land in Ireland If they would abolish jud_ments and entails, establish a county rnister, ymaso Ec rprymetb transferred with as much readi'ness as intho cohobd courts of this country, and adopt a few other simple measures for facilitating the transfer of real estate, they would confer a vast benefit upon the county, and would render an Encumbered states Court altogether unnecessary To get rd of all the difficulties, they had only to provide, insteadof creating new offlces at great expense, that the appeals from the Court of Chancery should be to 'th Court of Exchequer Chamber. he would support theo bil if he thought it likely to attain the object in view; hut aS he believed it would not do so he should fote agaonst the second reading. Mr. MhAIceS weas in stein difticulty how to votfe po the present occasion. Thero was much in the bill which he approved, but also a good deal which he disapproved. It was proposed to appoint two vice-chancellors. Be thought statements had been rade to the Hoase which rendere eit incumbent that tbat course should be adopted. It was pro posed to abolish the masters in ordinary- that had lately endone in En,gland, and he thought the Court of Chan cery had been saved by the abostion of the masters' offices. It was prop?osed to constitute a courtof appal in Ireland. Iofapproved that object, thongh ho objected to the constitution of the court, thinking that no court of appeal should consist of less than three judges: He also approved that part of th bill which altered the procedure in Chancery, and did not object to the discontinuance-not ammediately, but after some time-of the Encumbered Estates Court. But the other provisions of the bil weroa ben to grave objections. Considering the immense arrears o busi ness in the Encumbered EBstates Court-no fewer than c,60o esttesrem sningtao fsold-andtathegreat difficulty of the Court was, not the selling of the estates, but the distribution of the proceeds, nothig could be more wildthan to transfer the whole of that business at once to the Coart of Chancery, clogging the new niachincry which i was proposed to create there. ear, hear.) He, therefore, approved the smugestion which had been made, that the Encumbered yEstate Court should be retained for a time. It had been proposed that theprese,trbi, with those introduced bythe horu and learned member for EnnisiElleu, should be referred to a sdeect committee. He hope that course would be adopted. It would be impossible to consider the bill fully in a coin niittee of the whole House. There were objcbtions to almost every clause, and some of the provisions were of tha most outrageous nature. He could not understand for what reason iti was proposed that the patronage of the ofces of the court should be in thec ands of the lord-Lieuteant-that was te sab, in the Governmcnt of the day. Great advantgwe had aisen in the Englsh Court of Chancory from thc judges having the scetion of theirrown officers. When patronage was in the hands of the Governmenlt, it was given to its supporters, not to the most ft and proper persons for the offices. |tWhy, then, did the hon. and learned gentleman depart, in this matter, from the practice in England, from the report |of the commission, and from his own P reposal of last year?' Was patronaze for ever to he the blight of Ireland? Aeain, it ws proposed by this biwU that the chief clerks should We barristers. hn England they were not bafristers, but sonlcitors. Why wRere barnsters to be excluded in England butnadmittee in Iceland? He waj s afraid that in tieland there was a class of barristers who clung to the patronage more than was the case in England. Another part of this bill to which he objected was that which would throw upon the Court of Chancery the whole conveyaucing of the co ntry. If that were carried out, there must be as many conveyancing counsel acting maserthe direction of the coart forthepuroswofinvesthepinctitles as there werenovhcwriting clerks tor making out tphe docaments. Under thesE circumstances he trusted that the hon. and learned gentleman (iWr. Fitzgerald) would consent to refer the bill to a select committee. f it were understood thoatitat course was to be adopted, he (Mr. Maibs) would vote for the second reading; hut, if it was not, le must oppose the bill passing that stage. MEr. EL HERBERT, as one whEo had assisted to p.sS the Esncumibered Estates Act, justified his support of this measure, which destroyed the court erected under that act, on the ground that, as the present Master of the Rolls, the author of that act concurred in the report of the commission on which this bill was founded, he could net but entertai confidence that therewas in itnothing which was inconsistent w ith the principles of the measure vhich it was intended to supersede. Onc effect of the Encumbered Estates Act had been to diminish the value of al land which was not sold under its operation, and for which, therefore, no Parliamentary title could be given. That injustice the resent bill nrofessed to remedy. H, as aenonprofessional man, could net say whether, as it now stood, the measure would fmlfel that promise; but he felt confident that itc ould not bc allowed to pass without its provisions being made to accord with the expectations which it held oat. Mr. CaS, bein the only membrer of the Encumbered Estates Court toemnission in the hous who was not connected with any of these bills, wiched to state the reasons which had led the commissioners to adopt the conclusions at which they had arrived. He was sorry to see that this had been trcated as a lawyer's buestion. That was not the light in which he viewls ed It, nor had it been so regarded by the commission of which h e was a mcmber oThe cosmmissioners began their labours by endeavouring to obtain from the officers of the Encumbered Estates Court in Dublin, tand the members of the bar, ever kind of information that could be afforded them. After taking that evidence ithe commissioners held a meeting in this cour..ry, at which Sir.J. :oinilly, Mr. Blackburn, the late Lord 4 'hancehlor of Ireland, and others were present, and he might state that there was laong them not the slightest difwerence of opinion as to the past c rking of the Encambered states Coulrt, the unanimous opinion being that that Court had done infinite service for Ireland (hear hear), and that whatever less it had occasioned the individuals at its commencement, the time had long gone by whensuch a charge could be brought against it, and that it was to be viewed as a court that was affording a market for the sale of land in Ireland sunerior to what could be obtained in any other quarter. (Rear, hear.) They thereo fore came to the conclusion that it would be idle to propose to Hcr Matesty to abolish or curtail the powers of the Encumbered Estates Court; but then the question arose, was it sufecicuwttocentinuethe existingopowersofthatcourt? Rhear.) It was clearly shown to the commission that cases were constantly occurring to which the Encumbered Estates Court to couldnotdomplete justice-that other questions besides those of the mere sale of land freqently came of which it could not take cognizancet and which ita had to relegate to other tribnals. ilt was found also that the court which was dealing with the greater pht of the land of Ireland conducted its proceedings in an obscure street in Dublin, and a loud cause of complaint was that the publc could not command in it those professional services whic wore rqauired. (Hear, hear.) It was obvious, therefore, that it woulde necessaryto remove it to another sitation; and, morover, thatdif they did anything with thcour Ot they would have to consider the necessity of adding to the staff which was notorioasly insraident with regandto such persons as clerks and examiners. (Hear, hear) A still morc important questieo, however, was whetrer, when they were going to make the powers of the Encuabered Estates Court pprmanent, they had any right to confine those powers to estates that were encumbered. (Hear, hear.) Complaints on this score came to them from various parts of the country. Proprietors whose estates had never been encumbered to the extent of a shilling wished, nevertheless, to sell them, and they asked, with some reason, why they should not be permitted los~eThlthemi a-cour where they would get from 20 to 30 per cent, more than if they were sold in any other way. (ear, hear.) The hen. f and iearned member for Enniskillen (. Whiteside) challengedhim to say that there had ever occurred a single case of nictitious encumbrance, in order to get an estate into thisI court. X0ow, he certainly could not give the name in any such case, but the commisioners had it in evidence that fictitious encumbrance were resorted to. Mr. Smith, a berister in Dublin, stated that he had known cases where encumbrances vwere created by proprietors onunencumbered estates expressly for the purpose of thereby selling the estates with a Parliamentaryvtitle, and his testimony was borne out by others. (Hear, hear.) iBut, apart from this, there was no reason or principle why the prifi- lege which was granted to an encimbered should not be extended to an unencumbered estate. (Hear, hear.) Carefully reviewing all the circumstanees of the case, the commioners came to the conclusion that therewas no valid reason why the privilege of conferring Parliamentary titIes should not be extended to unencumbered estates. Afterthey had made the court permanent, extended its jurisdiction, enlargeditsstaff, and erected new buildings, what would have been the result? Manifestlythis-tlat they would have had side by side the Court.of Chancery, with all the powers of the Encumbered Estates'Court, and the Encumbered Estates Court, with all the powers of the Court of Chancery-two tribunals of co-ordinato urisdiction, with a double outlay for judges and, officers. hnis being obviously undesirable, the commissioners concluded that, provided it should be found possible to make the co3t as moderste and- the manner of- proceeding as simple in one court asin the other, there could be no better course than to bring the whole system within the compas and oneration of- one tribunal. (Hear, hear.)

This howeover, did not at all vary with what happened in nEgland, where there was an appeal from a Vice-Chancellor either to tho Lord-Chancellor sitting alone, or to the Lords Justices, of whom only two generally sat. So that in the latter case, if a differenoe of opinon occurred between the two, the result was precisely what wvould arise in ' the court of ippeal proposed by this bil.L Mr. 3MALNS.-The Lords Justices' Court consists of three. Ir. CAIBNS.-No doubt that was the theory; but practically it oftener sat with only two. The next question of detail was as to the appointment of the chief clerks of the judges, not by the judges themselves, but by the Lord-Lieutenant. This provision, if adopted, would be fatal to the wholemeasure. (Hear, hear.) It 'was framed in direct and flagrant oppsition to the views of the commissioners, who recommended that the Mlaster of the Polls and the vicechancelors should each be assisted by a chief clerk and tw6 junior clerks, the selection of whom should rest with those Judges themselves, who would be held responsible for the due performance of the duties of their subordinates. It was to be hoped, therefore, that the Government would modifythis part of theirbil. Thehon. member for Horshlam (Mr. S. Fitzgerald) said that another provision of the bill would have the effect of excluding Mr. Hargrave, the junior commissioner, from tho proposed court. This result was one which would certainly be much to be regretted, for no member of the Encumbered Estates Court had rnoro succesfully or satisfactorily discharged his duMes than that gentleman; and the Executive woulId, therefore, do wellto secure a continuance of his services, and they should alter the bill with that vievr if such a course was realt necessary. Thatwerenot a proper time for entermngfurthermto an examination of the details of thlis measure. lndeed the course of the debate of that night showed that it would be inconvenient to discuss points of detail in a committee of the whole Hlouse (hear, hear), tehrefore it was greatly to be desired that the Go. vernment should consent to refer tho whole of these bils, after their second reading, to a select committee. (Hear, hear.) Mr. G. BUlTT concurredwith the hon. and learned gentleman.who last spoke in approving generally of the reconmmendations of the commission, and, in so far as this bill was framed in accordance with those recommendationssathough in many respects it was not so framed-it should have his support. He did not think that the objections he entertained to some of the details of the measure, which required careful consideration, and in his opinion much alteration, would justify him in voting for the amendment. He would recommend the Solicitor-General for Ireland to assent to the suggestion of the hon. and learned member for Belfast, that the bill should be read a second time, on the understanding that it should be referred to a select committee along with the bils which had been introduced by the hon. and learned member for EnniskiUen (Mr. Whiteside). Oye objection urged against referrin this bil to a select committee wHas the length of time that might he occupied in the discussion of its provisions, but, on the other hand, if the details of the measure were considered in a committee of the whole House a great deal of time must necessarily be consumed, and he theouht with less probability of a satisfaltory result. He would, therefore, move that this bil, along with the hiUs of the hon. and learned member for ELiskiluena be referred to a select committee. (eear, hear.) The hil as now framed departed n one very important respect from tho recommendations of the commissioners. Thocommissioners recommendedthat theofficers of the courts, the chief clerks and others, should be appinted by the judges but this bil prop osed that such appoointments should be vested in the Lord Lieutenant * and hc appealedito thce SoietoraGenewi forEngland, whether it 'was possible the system could work well if the judges had not the appointment of these officers upion whose knowledge, zeal, and integrity they were obliged to rely? He fuzlly approved that portion of the measure which prou osed to render the jurisdiction of the Encumbcered Estates ourt 'applicable-to estates which were not encumbered (hear, hear), but the mode in which this was to be effected would require careful consideration, in order that those inconveniences which had been suggested as likely to arise from such an enlarged jurisdiction of the Encumbered Estates Court might be avoided. He thought that, with the assistance of the Solicitor-General, a mode of registe n titles and of giving Parliamentary titles might be devi which would be very advantageous to the people not only of Ireland, but of England. Sir E. PERRY said, this bill involved a question which had long received his attentive consideration-namely, the formation of a judicial establishment for dispensing justice ins cheap and summary manner. He confessed that, from w hat he Lad heard of the object of the bill, lie had come down to the house with strong prepossessions against itbut, after hearing the able speech of the hen. and learned member forBelfast, he was satisfied that the principle which it aimed atestablishing was altogether- sounid. The object of all law reforms was to destroy the vicous system of procedure which had long marked English law, and to render justice accesnsble to the pooras well astotherich npon the cheapest and simplest terms; and, if the oblct of this bill, was simply to transfer the jurisdiction of the Encumbered Estates Court to the Court of Chancery, he regarded it as an admirble measure, and one which ought to receive the support of all stanch law reformers. Attention had been caled to those details of the bill which referredto the judicial patronageto be created. HIe had himself been caed upon to dispense such patronage, he had for 20 years witnessed its dispensation in this country and in India, andhe believed there was no greater blot npon our judicial system than the manner in iwhich such pattowage was exereised bymembers of the bench. The judges of the united kingdom were celebrated for the high position wnich they held and for their immaculate dispensation of justice, but,if any fault 'was to be attributed to-them,it certainly was in connexien with their mischievous distribution of the p.atronsgre p]acedin their hands. Officeswerecreated towhich the jud ges were allowed to appoint; then fees were levied for the paysnent of the officers; and the greatest evils connected with the administsution of justice would he found to have arisen from this mischievous imposition of fees and the unwillingness of judges to interfere with the recipients. He believed that nearly all the quarrels and difficulties that arose with respect to the courts of law in India might be clearly traced to the improper exercise of patronage, and he thought one of the most valuable points in the present measure was the propositin to transfer the patronage from the judges tothe execative Government. Of course, the Executive were just as likely as a judge to make a bad appointment, but the advantage of the transfer would be that While, from the high position held by the judges in this country, no man-however desirous of exposIng a job-would venture to attack them, if theexecutive Government-the HomeSecretary or the lord-lieutenant-mado improper appointments, half-a-dozen members on both sides the house would at once spring up and impugn their conduct. He thought two broad prnaiples had been clearly established by law reformers duriig the last 20 years, as those upon which the administration of the law courts should be bared-first, that fixed salaries should be paid to the officers of the courts; and, secondly, that the subordinate appointments shonid be vested in the executive Government, which would be responsible for their disposition. Mr. KENIEDY was in favour of referring the several bills relating to the subject to a select committee. The grievances complainedofwere mere matters of detail and ad- iutted of an easy remedy. The profession had great reason to complain of the inconvenient locality in which the Encumbered Estates Court was placed. It was at least threequarters of a mile from all their other practice, and they were thus expected, as itfwere, to be in two places-at once.- The consequence was-and this was thereal grievance-that some half-a-dozen gentlemen monopolized the whole practice of the court, but it certainly was a strange remedy to propose for this to throw the business of the court into the Cout of Chancery, which had already as much of its own as it could well get through. (Hear, hear.) He had no objection to allow the Court of Chancery to deal with unencumbered property; but the encumbered estates, for the present, at least, ought to be left to the tribunal which had hitherto dealt with them in a manner satisfactory to all parties. He did not despair, however, of seeing the whole business united at some future time, when the circunstances of the country were changed and the present arrears cleared off under one tribtnal. Unless the Government would consent to refer these bills to a select committeo be should support the amendment of the hon. member for Horshams._ __ M. T. O'BIR T supported the second reading of the bill, thinking that its details-to some of which he objected -would be much better delt with by a committee of the whole House thauby a select committee. Mfr. J. MZGERAID said that, Though the oppo. nents of the seceo' reading of the bill were numerous, their -argume were so inconsstent and irreconcileable that l 'might well be smid to answer and refute each of 'or -stanoe, the arguments of the hon. and leariemember for Eninidlen completely counterbalanced whatever weight might be possessed by those of the hon. member for Morsham. The hon. member for Drogheda, in the snme way, might be: set against the hon member for Portarlington and the two hon. and learned members for WezIord entirely neutralized each other. Al, however, with tho solitaxy exception of the hon. member for Portarlisgton, seemed to agree in this one. principle-that there should be a oentinuanro of the system of-thelEncumbered Estates Court ir Ireland. (Hear, hear.) He wAs himself one of the strongest advocates for a contimmance of the system wbhicthhQ beleved had worked well for the country, but he drew a distinction between the, sysem and the tribunal. The popur oection was to t'ge transference to the Court of sneey. he Encurmhd EstatActwas-atempOra meaure, teutitu tn exceptional-tribinalorasllyfor three years - 1852,when thst period bad elapeed, a new Gevernmqnt was in offee, And ord Derby stated h inenoU t contue tha act for another year, during which the attention of theTerd Chancellor would be directed to simphfying the proceedings of the Court of Chancery to adapt it to carrying on the business of the Encumbered Estates Court. The members of the other House were- generally in favour -of a transfer ,-of the jurisdiction to the reformed Court of Chancery, and, whenever the subject waas discussed'in that house, it Was argued that the Encusnbered Esates Court should not lbe made-perpetual, but that inquiry hold be instituted whether it ought not to be trausferred to theCourt of Chancery. A COmIssion ied, accordingl, in 1854, and upon such high authority as the reportoM o t ommission he ta the te& inaskiig nt hjde prevaise,sion the tits tciedinaskiX othe House to read the bil a second time. But his case did not restthere. Thiebill,instead of throwing the Ecumbeored Estates Cour into the Court of Chanocery, would convert the Couirt of Chancery into the ucpumbered Esttes Court, asfar as reIarded simplicity of t edi th in 1849, wheni the latter courtwas establshed, 17 eassunrth of Chancerywasunrefornev ge T nold system est tose suit refler from g st euge tr the mnonths acI ,againo prothsea dge,revto so that fit wso edns Oa o rskou the saet of aneerybe t estate.

It was now propased further to simplify tbE proceedings so as to niake the Court of Chancery the cheopest and best tribunal to which this new jurisdiction couldf we intrusted. It was proposed to abolish toe system of msen and to make it imperative on the judgeto taharge of -ay case from their commaencement tothLoeir termination. To, still further simplify the practice and procedure, an end vould be put to every technicality-tw all days for want of partes or from deaths of suitors, and he ventured to predit that, instead of the Court of Chancery being the bug bear of ' the country, it would become the cheapest and simplest and most expeditious tribunal in the land. He said confidently that in the Irish Court of Chancery cases were decidea more rapidly and with Ies expense than could be doneinanycourt oflaw. If ie was righ. inthe statements which he had maade, ws there any need of as). prehension in conferring upon that, court, in an imlowvay condition, this ner j'urisdiction 9 In confirmation o what pehad stated, he might mention that within theflastilO days hehad receive a letter from theLord Cbatcells of Ireland in which that learnedperson stated that he had then dIspDsedofllt'hecasesihiscourt which had been in existence before the last term, except two or three postponed, at the request of the parties; andhre was then proedineto hear, o anLdy hearin eases of thle LwstAerr, anver hopeds to conclude the whole of them before he rose. The same statement was lade respecting the business before -the Master of the heolls. The next objectdion which lie (Mr. ]Fitzgerald) would reforto was as to the continuance of the Encumbered Estates Court, He had ever been an advocate of that cour, and liad always pedicted its saccess. He had always felt thedifficultyof denygto owners of unencumbered estates the advantages which that court bestowed upon the owners of encmbered roet,as it was certain that P.

The hon. and learned gentleman was 3ighLt in stating that this was contrary both to the recommendionto ofithe commission an tothe obil of lastyear. Buthe would exltain how the case stood. By thepassing of thismeasure two classes of subordinate officerswould be thrown i out of emplo poment; first the examiners of the four mnastersv and, secondly, the staff of the Encurmbered Etates 45ourt. It was recommended by tne coumission. to appoint as many of the officers of the Encumbered Estates Court as it wa practicable, it being considered of public advantage that their services should be secured. Considering that if these appointments were left to the judges they would be without any check, it wbas thoght wiser to vest the apwhictmehts in the Eecutive, and, whoever might 1)0 the Chief Secretary for Ireland, the appointments would be miade undler the pressure of arliamentary 'ii responsibiliy. That being the greatest job inD the bil, the hon. and learned gentleman then caled attention to what he described as being a sti greater job, which the hend, and leamed gentleman said was contained in clause 19. That clause rovided for the qualificatrou of chief clerk to the Lord Chanceor, oaster of the lRolls, or Vice-Chancellor ; and enactedl that he munst either be abarrister of six year'standing orasolicitor orattorney oflO-years' standing, or have hel the office of Master's examiner in the Court of Chancery, or of secretary, regis trar, or examiner in the Court of Chancery, or inth Court of Commissioners for the Sale and Transfer of Eucumbered Estates in Ireland. He confessed that he alone was responsible for the framing of that clause; and his object was to make the officers of the Encumbered Estates Court, whose efficiency had been proved, eligible to appointment to those offices But he did not thereby intend to prescribe to the Executive that such persons should be so appointed. He had also another ohject-namely, economy; for if the Executive selected any of those discharged officers the public would be relieved from making them compensation for the offices of which they had been deprived. The hon. and learned gentleman had said that there was an object in the clause, and that it Was intended to make provision for some particular individual. v, no one was more answerable for the clause than himself, and he (Mr. litzgerald) could assure the hon. and learned gentleman that lhe had not the most remote idea who the gentleman was to whom allusion was made. He only knew one person comnected with the Encumbered Estates Court, and he had been an officer from the commencement of that tribunal. The hor.. and learned gentleman's impression, therefore, wasentirely without foundation. The hon. and learned gentleman had also objected to the LiII, on the ground that in its very frame and SCOpe it was impossible to be carried oult * or, to nse his own words,- tha it was impracticable, and tiit the new court would be clogged up with business. The hon. and learned gentleman said that there were three commissioners in the Encumabered Estates Courts, and that it was proposed to transfer the duties they now. discharged to a court consisting of only two judges. It was true-there were three commissioners, but the chief of them was Baron Richards, who assurmed the office of Chief Commissioner, although he sat only in the appellate tribunal, and was not expected to do anv of the daily bsiness of the court. It was only recently that be had done so, as he reularly performed his duty as Baron of the Court of Ex;chequer. So that, although it was literally true that there were thre3 commiioners, yet substantally there were only two. He could not predict who might be the two new vicechancellors, but he did not think- it too much to say that they would be as able to tranct th business they would have to do as the two wvorking commisioners I the Encumbered Estates Court. Under the present bill the vicehancellors would be pronidedsithi an ample staff of tw cwhief and two junior clerks; and, as they w eld? commenc their duties without any arrears of businas, there wasreason to eppose that thes; would not be able to deal wihthe business that maight cosbeforetheminasatisfactorymanner.

I ZOfDOV, ISDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 13. l The House of Lords met yesterday at 2 o'clock.' -MThe LORD CHANCE1Boa read* a letter from L4d VM nAYDLE, statingthMt he deOMned-t6*nd, by Ids counsel, before the Committoeof Pvii then went into - comeait eges on the patent of the Wenaleydale Peerage. IMr. W. SxM, Assistant-Keeper of Record& Wasi caled, andproduced the patents of theBanbuty, the Purbeck, tbe Worcester, and other peerages, Sad copies of the journals referring to the summons of Peers called to the UJpper House during the life of their fathers. MIr. H. G. SARPE, Assistant-Keeper of the Rolls, was also called, and put in the translations and extensions of the text of the several patents, and extracts from them, ordered at the last sitting of the Committee. Lord LYNDinusT said the search for eases through the Rolls and Records had not been completed, and asked the LORD Cn}cemor. whether he would consider that the cases already printed comprehended all the questions required for raising the argument. The LORD CHANCELLOR could not give that assurance; Lord Lm-N-DHusr must take his own course and make out his own case. Lord LYNDHnsT stated that the MASM of the RoLLs declined to direct his officers to make the necessary search without an order of the House, and there had been no opportunity of obtaining that order. The Earl of DERBY thought the case should not be taken up like one between opposing counsel; it was not the case of Lord LT-DIIST alone, but, affected the whole of the Peers, and no obstacles should be thrown in the way of settling it. The LORD CHNCELLOR would not take any advantage of the incompleteness of the search of these documents; he would assume, in argument, that every search had been made. The Earl of DERBy believed the examination of documents would be completed by F:iday next, and suggested that the Committee should adjourn to that day, and then take the discussion on the evidence now before it. Lord LyziDHrsT gave notice that on Friday he should move a resolution, stating as the opinion of the Committee that neither the patent to Sir J. PARKE, nor the writ of summons issued in pursuan^e of it, could entitle him to sit and vote in Parliament. The Earl of DEBny asked if it was the intention of any Peer or of the Government to move an amendment on that resolution. Earl GRuNivLLE promised that if any amendment was moved due notice should be given of it ; but he must have time to consider the matter. L Lord BnoOUGHA.i hoped in the interval the Government would carefuIy reflect whether it could not relieve the House, the Parliament, and the country from the difficulty it had raised in a manner so uncalled for. The Committee was then adjourned till Friday next, at the usual hour of meeting, 5 o'clock. The House then resumed, and adjourned during I pleasure. Their Lordships re-assembled at 5 o'clock. The Earl of HAnnwscKE asked when the Government would lay on the table the papers relating to the fall of Kars. Earl GuArivrLLE was not prepared to answer the question. A resolution proposed by Lord RFDESDALE, in reference to the private business of the House, was agreed to after a short discussion. TheEarl of ABmErvr, in presenting a petition from the merchants of Singapore and other places, asked what measures the Government had recently taken to suppress piracy in the Chinese waters. Earl GRANVILLE stated that a steamer had been detached for that service by the Governor-General of INDIA. The Trial of Offenders Bill, the Mietropolitan Police Bill, and the House of Commons Offices Bill went through committee. The House then adjourned. In the House of Commons, on the order for the second reading of the Court of Chancery (Ireland) Bill, Mr. S. FrrzoanALD moved to defer the second reading for six months. He remarked upon the inconsistency of the SouicITon.-GNsui for Ireland in proposing to extinguish a Court (the Encumbered Estates Court) to whose salutary operation he bore the strong,est testimnony, and to transfer its functions to a Court which, upon the face of the bill, appeared to requirereform. He dwelt upon the vast amount of business which the measure would throw into the Court of Chancery, beyond the power of that Court to grapple with, and upon the additional expense it would cause in the first instance by the creation. of new places and the grant of compensations. He objected to the introduction of exceptional legislation, as applied to Ireland, in the power conferred by the billupon the Irish Court of Chancery of giving indefeasible Parlialmentary titles. The amendment was seconded by Mr. PoLxTnD- URQT7HART. Mr. DEASY supported the bill. Mr. FITzGm AD, he contended, had not dealt with its principle, but with its details and machinery. Themeasure involved three principles-namely, the perpetuation of the unusualpowersgiven to the Encumbered Estates Court, the transfer of those powers to the Court of Chancery, and the internal reform of the Court of Chancery itself. AUl opinions united in favour of the first. With regard to the second, he showed that evils and abuses arose from the defects of the Encumbered Estates Court, which could not dispose of various questions of law and equity, nor be clothed with the powers of the Court of Chancery without introducing a rivalry and conflict between co-ordiate jurisdictions. It was to the Court of Chancery, reformed as it had been, and regenerated as it wasto be, that it was proposed to transfer, uniting them with its own, the powers of the Encumbered Estates Court. lfr. M'CAn- opposed the bill, and deprecated any mieasure that would put an immediate end to the Encumbered Estates Court. Mr. ELLICE, although he would not, he said, refuse his assent to the second reading of the bill, warned the House to watch with great jealousy its provisions. The Court it proposed to abolish had been productive of great benefit to Ireland, and he should hesitate at parting with such a tribunal before he was convinced that something better was to be substituted for it. Bfr. Wn:rrsmE opposed the measure, simply because he believed it impossible (and this was the opinion of high authorities), through the medium of the Court of Chancery, to do the work which the bill proposed to cast upon it. He objected to the bill, moreover, as a job. The new officers were to be appointed, not as usual, by the judges, but by the oGovernment-a course, in his opinoi. not fair or respectful to the Irish Chancery Judges. He objected strongly, likewise, to the Court of Appeal created by the bill, and to the making the Court of Chancery the great conveyancing engine, at the expense of the State, for Ireland alone. These were objections not of detail, but of principle. M1r. Serjeant O'BIEN defended the bilL The first question was whether the power of giving a Parliamentary title to estates in Ireland should be continued or not. If it was, it should be extended to unncumbered property; otherwise it would be an injustice to owners of estates. Then, was the Encumbered E statesCourtto be remodelled, so as to be enabled to deal with questions of contract andtitle ? If that was done, there would be two Courts of Equity in Ireland and aconflict of jurisdiction. He believed the reformed Court of Chancery would be quite able to dispose of the additional business. Mr. GEonox did not concur with MIr. S. FrzGERALD, who wished the jurisdiction of the Encumbered Estates Court should be perpetuated; but he was not prepared to transfer it to the new Court of Chancery, with extended powers. It was contrary to every principle, he thought to allow that Court to give new titles to unencumbered and unlitigated propertiy. He would consent to the second reading of this bill only on the condition that it be referred, with Mr. WHnmrE7's five bills relating to the Court of Chancery, to a Select.Committee. Colonel DuNKE resisted the second reading of the bill, not because he wished the Encumbered Estates Court to be continued, but in order that its functions, which, he said, had done great evil and injustice, might cease. - Mr. BLT,D was favourable tothebil, but iniFited upon the necesaity of continuing the Encumbered Estates Court until it had wound up its arream, which would clog the new machinery in the Court of Chancery. Mr. EnioH spoke in favour, of the bill, fr. IVMAtow against it, and Mr. MAxn;s partly for and paly vgainat it, offering to vote for the aseoad reading if the bill was to be refernd to a Select Committee. Mr. H. EEnBERT eonsidered that the owners of inencumbered property should have the same advantages with respect to title as encumbered owners. Mr. CAwNS, as one of the Commissioners upon whose report the bill was founded, explained the reasons of their recommendations that the privilege of acquiring a Parliamentary title should be extended to unencumbered owners, and that the powers oftheEncumberedEstatesCourtshouldbetransferred to the Court of Chancery, the practice of the latter Court being assimilated for the purpose to that of the former. The objection founded upon exceptional legislation came too late, after the establishment of an Encumbered Estates Court in Ireland, which did not exist in England. Mr. CAnuis considered other objections reoarding matters of detail, in some of which the bill, he observed, departed from the recommendations of the Commissioners; and he thought it would be satisfactory if this and the other bills were referred, after the second reading, to a Select Committee. . This suggestion was strongly urged by Mr. G. BuTT, who assented to the principle of the bilL Sir E. PEPnY supported the bill, and hoped that the Soraorron-GENmsuA for Ireland would adhere to that part of the bill which placed the patronage in the hands, not of the Judges, but of the Government. Mr. KENwnEDY opposedand Mr. P. O'Bi.rsupported the bill. Mr. J. D. FrERAxiD, in making a general reply in defence of the bill, noticed the antagonism of opinions in the HIouse, except upon one point. All agreed that there should be a continuance of the system of the Encumbered Estates Court--a tribunal which was never intended to be perpetuaL In 1849, when that Court was established, the Court of Chancery could not have done the business given to the Encumbered Estates Court; -whereas smce then its system had been totally altered anad its proceedings simplified; and it was now proposed further to relieve and reform that Court, so as to make it a cheap and speedy tribunal, and fit to deal with the business which the biU would transfer to it. He then proceeded to meet objections offered to the principle of the measure, and to justify the conferring upon the Court of Chancery power to give a Parliamentary title to owners of landed property which was not encumbered. With reference to the charge of a job, preferred by MIr. Wim}snx against the bill, he explained the reasons for deviating from the recommendations of the Commissioners, and not leaving the nomination of the new officers in the Judges, but giving it to the Executive, under responsibility to Parliament. He was wiDina that this bill should be referred to a Select Conmittee, but he could not consent that Mr. WHrisDres five bills should be sent with it. Mfr. NA.PiER said, from all he had heard it was his conviction that if this bill passed the whole thing would be brought to a dead lock. After a few remarks by Mr. BENrcK, Mr. DIsB,Imy said he thought it would be the nmost judicious and graceful course to refer all the bills to a Select Comnuittee. Mr. S. FITZGomALD having withdrawn his amendmient, the biU was read a second time. On the order for the second reading of the Juries (Ireland) Bill, M1r. WHTESIDE objected that the bill would aggravate the evils of the present jury law in Ireland. Mir. J. D. FITzGEAmuD shortly defended the bilL Ultimately the second reading was postponed until that day fortnight. The Drainage Advances Acts Amendment Bill was read a second time, after a reply by Mr. WrLsox to a call for explanation by Colonel DuimE. The Turnpike Trusts Arrangements Bill and the Commons Enclosure Bill were read a second time. The report of the Committee of Supply was brought up and agreed to, after some remarks by Mlr. W. Wn.ars, answered by Mfr. WnLsox. The Charitable Uses Bil passed through committee, with amendments. Sir G. GREY moved for a Select Committee to inquire into the present constitution of the Ecclesiastical Commission for England; into the operation of the act of the 13th and 14th of Vicroni, c. 94, and of the act of the 14th and 15th of VwToRrA, c. 104; and into the expediency of further continuing the last act, and of consolidatino' the Church Building Commnission with the Ecclesiastical Commission. He stated briefly the objects in view in appointing this committee and the subjects which woulld come under its consideration. A conversation ensued, in which Mr. Spoo-iiimn, Mr. LAssTT, Mr.. IINGouA, the Marquis of BLANroRD, Mr. WA-'O LE, and other members participated, and the motion was a,greed to. The remaining business having been disposed of, the House adjourned at 20 minutes past 12 o'cloclk
It is a piece of reiteration on our part to state that, inasmuch as the CHkN.CsELToR of the ExcH,qunm increased our debt in all forms last year about 23,000,0001., it is scarcely to be expected that he can do with much less addition to the debt this year. We must therefore express our surprise at the very small amount of the loan announced yesterday. All that the CHANCXe,on of the E&cnIEQmm asks for at present is 5,000,0001. ; and out of the 7,000,0001. excess upon the usual amonnt of the floating debt he only proposes to fund 3,000,0001. The latter is simply a matter of account, so it is to the former alone that we have to direct our attention. It is a very small sum compared with the extraordinary demands on the Treasury, which cannot be less than they were last year. There is not a preparation for war which is not carried on with even greater energy and cost than last year at this time; and, as we have frequently observed, the cost of war is one of those effects that come long after the eause. A loan of only 5,000,0001. will certainly entail the necessity of a loan of 16,000,0001., or more, before the close of the session. The calculation probably is, that by the time all the instalments of this loan are paid in peace will be proc6Aimed, our army will be on its way back, our fleets be paid off, and Consols be near par. In that case the 16,000,0001. will certainly be obtainedl on easier terms than just now. Nevertheless, it is of no use to blink the fact that some such sum will certainly be wanted, and that even the smallness of the sum now asked for, as well as the rapidity with which the instalments are to be paid, proves the imniinence and anount of the next appeal that wiul be made to the moneyed world. In fact, this dribblet of a loan is just to satisfy present needs and stave off the evil day till, it is to be hoped, the Conference at Paris has come to a happy and honourable conclusion. The gentlemen who met Lord PALmES-ToN and the CHm\cmon of the ExcHEQumt at the Treasury attempted in vain to extract some sort of omen for the future, and inl the silence of the oracle had the strongest confirmation of their own jusi forebodings. We believe their part will not. be so easy. If they bid high, they may spoil their game 'hen the grand loan comes on; yet they evidently have an interest in keeping up public credit. For our part, we conceive that we have uo other interest or duty in the ail'air than to speak as plainly and boldly about it as we can; to enlighten the ignorance of some and dispel the illusions of others; to keep well before our readers the true condition of the public fnances, and let them know the real significance of a loan of 5,000,000., to be paid up in two months from this time-that is, within a fortnight after the reassembling of Parliament from the Easter recess.-
'What was Irelind before the Encumbered Estates Act came into operation? An ansiver to this question must be sought in the hideous annals of. the Wlhiteboy, or in the ludicrous ebronicles of Castle. Bwa4rent. Let us omit all mention of the noithern province, and excludo also from vie4 the estates of those great Enigali proprietors, who, holding land ii Irelan4d coild afford tX ad as landlords to their teiiftts. Wo! are not 3bout to lay any ta- upon the historical capacities of our readers. We do not propose to take, them back to the times when -DAm O'Co r,rn, a little ingenuous boy, was about to start as a pupil for Douai,. nor to the sober seaaon of '98. In the course- of our few remarls no Irish M.P. shall be introduced as returning to his paternal acres in the family heasse amid the sincere lamentations of a numerous body of attached creditors; no Irish gentleman shall shoot sixteen of his intimate friends in support of Colonel BATH's favourite theory of the "'dignity of man." We ask but to turn back fifteen leaves in the volume of Time, and tak;e our Irish friends as they were fifteen years ago-in the year of grace 1840. The projected shadow of the coming evil lay very blak on the land even in that day. Plague, pestilence, famine, murder, and sudden death were all at hand, but the demagogues stuck to their agitation, and the peasants to their traditional lawlessness and their ghastly mirth, even when the last plank was sinking beneath their feet. It was felt on all sides that there was something fearfully amiss. Ireland was guessed at like a riddle, manipulated like an experiment, laughed at like a stock joke, venerated like a great mystery. It was clear enough Irishmen could not, or would not, tell us anything about the causes of their distress; and if any Englishman ventured at a modest guess they all rose upon him as on a wicked man, intent only upon deriding the sufferings of an oppressed people. They were even proud of their inexplicable distress, as a patient is proud in a hospital when sixteen physicians have pronounced him to be labouring under sixteen distinct forms of disease. There is something, after all, in being a puzzle to the faculty, and such was Ireland to the faculty of polticians. The only thing clear was that everything went wrong. Landlords got no rent; mortgagees got no interest; the tenants who paid no rent talked of hard times-and when an Irishman taLks of hard times he shoots an agent froma behind a stone dike; the political agitators bellowed, and suggested a deliberative assembly of Irishmen on College-green as the panacea for all their ills, and it was they who would have deliberated; the priests on the Sunday denounced the base Saxon and the " bloody "a n-d brutal" 'Whigs from their altars by way of humanizing their flocks; squatters squatted where they would, in defiance of law and landlord; and the Iandlords in retaliation sent policemen and soldiers, if need were, to pull their cottages about their ears. There were only four well organized bodies in the country. There were the police-they were pretty well organized; there were the priests-they were very well organized; there were the political agitatorsthey were organized better still; and, finally, there were the Whiteboys-they were organized best of alL There were not any conservative bodies, with the exception of the police, and the vigour displayed by that body was but an index of the crime that was abroad. Now, when any person ventured in that day to insist upon it that the great social curse of Ireland was the bankrupt condition of the landlords, he was looked upon not only as a man of weak judgment, but as oue of perverted principles and wicked heart. What ! take away the land fromn the owner of it?T What! deprive the farily of its possessions, when it was matter of notoriety that the O'RowLs, of B3allythunder, had held their paternal acres for three centuries, during two of which they had set their creditors at defiance; and, during one, creditors and mortgagees? Their successful defence of the "property" entitled them at least to an honourable capitulation. Besides, nobody but an Irish landlord could manage an Irish tenantry. This is a saying which has often puzzled us. It was quite clear that a demand for the half-year's rent could but have led to one result-murder. Would it have done to sing a melody or two of MIoosz to the defaulting tenant, and endeavour to soften his heart with music? Would it have been politic, on the whole, to incite him to perform one of his national dances, and, taldng advantage of the excitement of the moment, to appeal to his better feelings? No-nothing of all this would have done. Ireland must be given up to the Irish. Landlords and tenants in that eccentric division of the empire must be left to buly and shoot each other in their own way. It would be repugnant to the feelings of all classes of the community if any attempt were made to put their arrangements, as between landlord and tenant, upon the same footing as in other countries. There was no help for it. We had other things to think of; and, after all, it was to be presumed that the Irish peers and Irish members knew what was best for their own section of the empire. At last the famine came, and after the faminme the plague, and the improvident but inevitable sacrifice of millions of pounds on the altar of humanity. It was at last felt that the evil had reached so intolerable a height that some remedy was absolutely necessary in order to avoid the recurrence of evils which were an imperial disgrace. IJnder these circumstances the EncumberedEstates Commission was formed, and directed to take estates from nominal owners who had already made away with all their rights, andto transfer them under a secure and Parliamentary title to purchasers who could afford to pay for them their proper value, and enter into possession -with unfettered hands. The operations of this Commission have been eminently successful. Thanks mainly to the exertions of the Commissioners, and to the timely policy of the measure intrusted to their administration, Ireland ias been converted into a country very different from her former self. We do not say that the presence of -a rich proprietary body is the panacea for all Irish ills, but certainly without the presence of solvent landlords we should have very little expectation of future improvement in that country. Well, then, now that this measure has been so very successful, it is gravely proposed to extinguish the Encumbered Estates Court, and to transfer its powers to the Irish Chancery. What is the necessity for this? " Oh ! " said MIr. DAsY, last night, " the Irish " Chancery and the Encumbered Estates Court side "by side constitute two co-ordinate jurisdic*" tions." Mr. Serjeant O'BR=n added, that if the power of giving Parliamentary titles to estates in Ireland is to be continued, it should be extended to unencumbered property, and with that the Commission cannot deal.- It is also said by the supporters of the Irish Solicitor-General's Bm that it will, in reality, perpetuate the powers of the Commissioners in the hands of the Irish Chancery judges. 1M. Wn rrsm, in reply, believed the bill to be a mere job. The new officers were to be appointed by the Government, not by the judges of the Irish Chancery. This gentleman, in conjunc,tion with Mr. Er=oEx and several others, entreated the Government to let well alone-a request in. which we are very confident as manny of our readers as take an interest in the question will heartily join.
There are two parties very n iich aggriev0 by the present condition of Chu,rch-tes. Theirgievancee, however, are by -no mleann the saine. The clergy and churchwardens, backed by the more zoi miembera of the Ch,urch, haTe an ancieu4 *uwtomary right to levy rates for tho jepA of the church and for the maintenaco ot clvine service; but, while flattered -with tho prtWnoe of thm right, they cal only enforo it witk +he, assistance of a majority in the V ,by. It frha quently happe is, therefore, that they camot eniforoe the right, aiud hrsve not done so for many year&-. in some parishes never at all in the nemory of ,nan. Having, however, a legal maintenanoee they find it all the harder to collect -voIuntary sub. scriptious, or to put the church on the same footing as religious and charitable institutions of a minor character. They find it difficult to get either the one or the other, and betwreen the two stools of law and goodwl the church often fals to the ground. This grievance rankes in the mind of many a clergyman and many an earnest Churchman. They do not like to surrender the rights of the Church, and give up the battle for Church-rates so long as the shadow of a right remains. Hence the most venerable- and august institution in the country, the very edifices of which are many of them as old as the COwQUEnOR and far older than. Parliament, subsists in many places in a state of proud poverty, or a medium between despotic pretensions and actual squalor. Such is the hardship of the Church. That of the Dissenters is also considerable. They are liable to be called on to pay to an institution which they tbink little better than the Popery that Churchmen, in com-mon -with themselves, have long ago renounced, and to support a rival at the demand of a tyrant majority. Notwithstanding aU that the bolder class of Church advocates choose to say about rates being an obligation, not on parishioners, but on houses and lands, they certainly are felt to be a burden on the conscience and an insult to independence. Nor are these the only clases aggrieved. They who pay rates for the support of a church two or three miles off, ihey who have built churches for themselves witiout the power of levying rates, they who find nearly the whole area of the church monopolized by large pews, and they who have the pleasure of hearing the sermons preached and the service conducted in a manner -which grates against all their warmest feelings and profoundest convictions, do notlike to pay a tribute which, besides its cost, is the symbol of an abject subjection. When this is the state of things, and when a civil war actually rages on the subject of Churchrates throughout the whole of the kingdom, so that it is only a question of time how long they wil -be collected in any given parish, it is a wonder that no decent plan has been hit upon for putting an end to a scandal and a nuisance. The only result, besides the civil war itself, with such superciliousness on the one side and rudeness on the other, has been a series of bids on both sides. Now it is the advocates of the Dissenting interest, now the friends of the Church, that come forward with a plan for putting the Church out of its pain by determining the question one way or another. Nothing shows so iU for the sense and temper of the Church as that it has not ere this settled upon some scheme for the satisfaction of all reasonable people. The Church of England at this moment does not possess any extraordinary amount of eloquence; it hardly professes to be learned; it eschews philosophy, and lays little claim to those austere virtues which won the reverence of a simpler age. It ought at least to exhibit some of that practical good sense with which most men supply the want of genius, poetry, and romance. . In no matter has it so great a call and so good an opportunity to exibit this one redeeming grace as in devising some plan for settling a wretched pecuniary squabble. So long as it simply looks on the breach widens, parish after parish falls a victim to the epidemic resistance, the rates, once refused, are never more granted, and there is an end of the question as far as that parish is concerned. Meanwhile,. every session is producing schemes from other quarters, all coming with the immense recommendation that, at all events, they settle the question. Many a man has acqniesced in a very strong remedy because he conld nlot stand the worry, and fret, and discussion about a mild one. In like manner even quiet church people will soon consent to the amputation of Church-rates altogether in order to save the perpetual blistering, plaistering, lancing, probing, cutting and hacking, that goes on at present. Indeed, every year that the Church declines to come forwaard with a remedy we are drifting nearer to the most summary possible treatment of the disorder. The bill just introduced by Sir WIm-us' CrAy, Mr. HuTrr, and Mr. M1AML to abolish Church-rates, and to maake other provisions in heu thereof, wiIL probably not be very acceptable to those Churcht people who have stood out for the Church's common law right to a maintenance by rates. It proposes to substitute for the rates voluntary subscriptions, to be spent, as the rates arenow, by the churchwardens, subject to five auditors, to be nominated, one by the clergyman, the other four by the congregation. This part of the bill is c£ the less importance, inasmuch as the auditors would not be wanted if there were no subscriptions, and, if there vere, the subscribers would probably take their own measures for the proper employment of their money. The real gist of the bill is the substitution of a voluntaty collection for a forced rate, and, though this may seemi to give up the whole question as regards the Church, yet -we cannot help suspecting it wmill come to this in the long rm. It certainly will if the Churcn does nothing. Had the Church in the metropolis not followea bacl counses, and resisted the extranural interment bills, one and all, for so many years, it would probably have made a much better bargain than it has now. The same result may be expected from the tenacity with which the Church clings to its rates. If it sets its face against all accommodation and all adjustment of claims, it wmill find that one day it will have to swallow as best it can some such simple and final measure as that now before
The importance of regular and rapid communication between our Australian colonies and the mother country is every day becoming more apparent; and, if anything were required to demonstrate it, the late commercial crisis would suffice, when *t may be said that the whole mercantile interest looked with breathless anxiety for the arrival of even a single ship laden wcith that precious metal which was' to relieve, were it ever so little, the pressure on. the money-market. While we at home were, perhaps, ansiously waiting the arrival of the costly freight, it was, through our own mismanagement, tossing for so many weeks uipon the ocear th&t the mere interest of the hundreds of thousands of ounces of gold thus- for the time sunk would have more than covered the price of a steamer tO convey it.

The following statement in reference to the TipperaryJoint-stockBank is extracted from the week-ly tradc report of the Freemu's Jo7Tuni. The fact of the draughts of the bank being refused by thc Bank of Ireland on SaturdAay was the topic of common conversation on that day, but no public allusion was made to it in any of the evening journals, in the hope that here, as in London, the refusal of the bank authorities to honour the draughts was merely the result of a " mistake :"- "A A sensation was made in the middle of the week by the announcement that the draughts of the Tipperary Bank on their London agents, Messrs. Glyn and Co., had been returned with the answer 'not provided for.' The alarm was somewhat diminished on the Bani of IreLand, their Dublin agents, continuing to pay up to Last night, and a statement also appeared that the misadventure in London was the result of accident. The course pursued by the Messrs. Glyn having throw-n a doubt on the bank produced its natural consequence-a severe and sudden demand for repayment fron their numerous depositora to an extent for which there was not sufficient time for preparation. Itis said, however, that all the brancheshave up to this fully met aU demands; but we cxceedingly regret to state that the Bank of Ireland have to-day refused to pay their draughts. We learn that great exertions arebeing made to enable the bank to continue business, which we trust will be snecessful, as the stoppage of a bank having so many branches atthepresentseasoncoadanot buxtproduce averybad effect. Thebank never did anybusiness in Dublin, andalways transacted their agency at the Bank of Ireland. They never issued notes, but availed themselves of a provision in the Bank Act, enabling them to issue Bank of Ireland notes on the terms laid down in the act. Their paid-up capital is said to be about 50,0001. in 10/. shares, but the amount of deposits is believed to be very large. The list of shareholders of the banki- appeared in the Gazct18 a few days ago It consists chiefly of English proprietors, there being out of 99 names 6S in England, the rest being chiefly in the. ocality, only a single shareholder, a highly respectable solicitor, residing in Dublin. The English proprietors are chiefly in the agricultural districts, two-thirds of the entire number being in the four counties of Essex, Bedford, Hertford, and Buckingham. There are 24 farmers in the lis', and five members of Parliament." The announcement of the death of Mr. John Sadleir, to whose enterprise the bank was mainly indebted for its existence, was telegraphed to Mr. V. Scully, M.P., in the course of last night, and is published in the papers of this morning. TnE MISRI ENCH. It is stated that an address from the Irish bar to the Lord Chief Justice Lefroy and Baron Pennefather is in preparation, on the subject of the late motion in the House of Commons. A similar address from the attorneys and solicitors is in contemplation. DARIXNG ATrEMPT AT ASSASSNA3TION. lhe Sligo papers of Saturday bring accounts of a daring attempt to murder, made on the previous nigsht on Mr. Lemon rstrong, agentleman of high position, residing ir. the county of Leitrimn. 3fr. Armstrong was returning from Sligo on a jauntrng car, accompanied by his wife, and was fired at when passing a grove of trees between Friarstown and Dromohair, the baU of the assassin strik-ing him in the hip and lodging in the thigh. Two men have been arrested, and Mr. Armstrong has identified one of them as being the person who fired the shot. This man's name is M7Gany, and he is, it appears, an old hand in the trade, having been formerly tried at Leitrim Assizes on a charge of murder. Another account says,- "i t appears Mlr. Arnstrong and his lady left Sli4o on their own car for home, and when within half-a-mile of Dromobair they met two men who saluted them, one of whom, however, as soon as the car paissed, turned round and fired at them. lodging some slugs in Mr. Armstrong's back, and completely riddng his coat. Fortunately, he was able to drive to the police barrack at 'Dromohair and give the alarm, whllen the police wvent at once in pursuit, and succeeding in arresting two men (brothers), on one of whom slg,cp,and a bullet-mould were found. Dr. Thompson, of Dromohair, and Dr. Lynn, of Sligo, were in attendance .as soon ss uossible, and we are happy to hear they do not consider the wound dangerouls."'
SUICIDE OF MR. JOHN SADLEIR, M.P. Although until the nature of the evidence as to the motive which induced Mr. Sadleir to commit suicide be known nothing positive can be stated, yet there seems to be an impression that the deceased had disordered his moind by over-speculation. That the deceased committed suicide the medical post vzortenz examination performed yesterday and other facts which have come to light distinctly prove. It seems that the deceased was at his club up till half-past 10 on Saturday night, at which hour he returned to his residence, 11, Glocester-square. At the club his friends observed nothing strange in his manner, and when he arrived home he seemed in his usual calm state of mind. He then ordered coffee, and, as he recquired nothing further, the servants, as was usual with them at that hour, retired to rest, leaving their master up drinking his coffee. Whether he went out immediately after taking tle coffee, or remained in until early the following morning, anrd then strolled up to Hampstead, no one can say, but the latter is the presumption, although at the same time it is certain that he did not go to bed that night, as his bed was found undisturbed the following (Sunday) morning, and when the servants got up they found their master absent. Indeed, his hours were so mncertain, on aecount of his Parliamentary duties, that the servants were not alarmed at his absence on the morning in question, for they considered he might have made an appointment late the previous night. He was in the habit of staying at Hampstead, at Jack Straw's. Tavern, and his lifeless body was found only afew yards from that inn. It has been erroncously stated, that the deceased's remains were discovered by the police, but they were found by a man named Bates, a donkey driver, who at half-past 8 o'clock on Snuday morning was proceeding in search of a strayed animal, when he came urn the corpse as it Lay at about 130 yards from Jack Straw's Castle, on the west side of the heath, and close to a small footpath which leads down from the flagstaff at the top of theulL Bates immediately hurried to the police-station. Inspector Green (S division) and other members of the force at once proceeded to the spot, and there found the deceased lying as if - alseep on a small mound, which he had evidently expressly picked out for the occasion, and a silver cup, together with a large-sized bottle,--nmarked with several labels, " Poison," by his side. Life had been extinct some time, although the body was then warm. Inspector Green had the body removed to the workhouse, and, upon examining the deceased's pockets be found a small slip of paper, on which was written,in a clear, hold hand, " Jobn Sadleir, 11, Glocester-square, Hyde Parlk" There was also some money, in gold and notes, in the deceased's pockets, as also a case containing two ra7ors and several lumps of loaf sugar, which the deceasedno doubt intended totaekewiththepoison. Inspector Green,through the slip ofpaperalludedto,wasatonceeenabled to send to town and have the deceased identified, the writing on the paper being recognized as his own, so that the poor man must have prepared it with the express intentiSn of its being the means of leading to his identification. The silver cup was immediately recognized as the deceased's own property thronob its bearing his crest. The bottle which had contained the poison, and which would hold at least half a pint, was not only labelled in several places with the word "poison," but the leather coveriog over the stopper had the same wvord w.ritten thrice across it in large letters. The deceased was a bachelor, and the melancholy event was in the course of yesterday telegraphed to his only relative, a brother residing in Ireland.

SECONSD EDITION. -THE TIrMBS OFFICB, TuesdayMorning. : EXPRESS FROM PARIS. ' The t,,llowing is the letter of our Paris corcespondent, ,dated yesterday, 6 p.m. - Count Buo.1' who left Vienna on the evening of the 12th, had u astened his departure by a day in order to have tilhe to see M. de Beust at Dresden, and to spend a few j,tOurs with his relatives at Frankfort and Mannheim. On taking leave of the Emperor His Majesty is re,.'orted to have addressed hirn nearly in these terms:- "You, my dear Count, know as wel or btter than any one the policy I have followed in the present question, *nd the intentions which I have always e'ntertained. In order to carry them out you need not adherW entirely to the letter of your instructions. AU that you Ao 'will I know be well done, if you contribute, as I hope, to the re-establish. ment of peace on a solid basis, and which -.ill be realized if it be a peace honourable for al parties.' If these words be correctly reported, Count Basol will represent not merely the person bet also the most secret thoughts of the Emperor. For some time past Count Buol had been looked upon with little favour by the Austrian aristocracy, in consequence of his adhesion to England and France. Since the acceptance by Russia of the Vienna propositions, and the greater probability of a pacific solttion, matters have changed. The night before he took his departure from Vienna his saloons were crowded by aU the Viennese aristocracy-so arowded indeed that there was hardly standing place. This may be cornsidered in the light of an amende honorable for their previous censure of his policy, and also their approval of his present acts; and we may conclude that the influence of MI. de Buol in the councils of Vienna is now more secure than ever-if the term can be applied to any MIinister. In one or two political circles here it is whispered that, however appearances may be to the contrary, the English Cabinet, or rather our representative at Vienna, is not quite easy in mind, and not over-contented with the indications he thought he observed in Count Buol a short time before setting out for Paxis. There were, it appears, certain symptoms which indicated a tendency to be too induilgent, too condescending to Russia. It is not unlikely that while he deprecated what were called exigences on the part of his own Government, our Minister at the same time exerted all his influence to counteract that Russian tendency in the Austrian Plenipotentiary, and to enforce on him the propriety of maintaining a dignified and firm attitude in the presence of the Russian Plenipotentiaries in Paris. In his very latest conversations he impressed, again and again, on his mind the absolute necessity that the allies who signed the treaty of the 2d of December should remain united and firm througlhout, and should not spoil the affair from the beginning by ceding one inch to Russia. It is to be hoped that the political atmosphere of Paris will not be found to possezs that relaxing power of Vienna -which had so fatal an effect on Lord J. RusselL BaronB. unow,who has by the way already paid his visits to the whole of the Ministers, and who was. to be received this afternoon by the Emperor, as also Count Buol, states, with much apparent frankness, that Russia is most anxious for peace, because she stands in need of it; and that she has suffered a great deal from the war. This opinion the Russian diplomatic agents both at Vienna and Berlin confirm. The latter say that though Russia has means at this moment for a third campaign, yet that she could not continue the war without exposing herself to the greatest dangers. Her armies may bo in force, and even be supplied with arms, food, and clothing, but the means cf transport are scarce, the distances are immense, and there is an almost total impossibility of expeditious communication. All thisisadmuittedby Russians themselves, who must be in a condition to know the truth. The admission ought not to make us more willing to give up a particle of our advantages from any ill-placed feeling of sentiment. Colonel Mlanteuffel was to leave Vienna for Berlin on the 15th. He returns extremely dissatisfied it is said with the turn affairs have taken, or pretends to be so; and does not conceal his feelings on the occasion. He says that it is not possible to conclude a peace which can be called solid or durable without the intervention of Prussia. He does not appear to convince his hearers of the fact, as, from what I can learn, the opinion that peace is certain is daily gaining ground among all classes in Vienna. Colonel M.anteuffel believes that Prussia is not treated as she ought to be, seeing that it was she who contributed the most to the acceptance by Russia of the Austrian propositions, which no other Power but herself could have obtained. The most natural remark on this assertion is, that if Prussia really possessed the great influence at St. Petersburg she now boasts she had, it is surprising she did not exert it before. The right she attempts to establish on the ground of her participation in the Treaties of 1841 is hardly tenable. These treaties were not made with the view totheirsubsequent modification, and, moreover, they, as all other treaties referring to the same question, are annulled by the war. You have been before this informed that the propositions of Austria were referred to the Commissions, with the object of framing a report. A project, intended to please both Rarties, was drawn up, it is said, by M. von derPfordten, and submitted to the Vienna Cabinet. The object was to preserve substantially what was demanded without exhibiting any want of dignity or consistency on the part of the Diet; to concele in weility all that Austria wished, while the Germanic Confederation should have the right of giving its judgment on the resolutions that may be come to by the Plenipotentiaries in Paris. The project of M. von der Pfordten appearedtoo generalinthe eyes ofthe Vienna Cabinet, andsthc ERporo - l-i-PIf agreedlwith his Minister that it should be strictly confined in its application to the fifth article of the propositions. M.vonderPfordten made no opposition, neither did A. von Beust, to its amended form, by which the idea of a representative of the Germanic Confederation at the Conferences was given up. According to this project the Confederation is made to express its approval and recognition of the propositions of Austria for the basis of negotiations for peace, and its gratitude to Austria for the efforts she has made in effecting their acceptance by Russia. It signifies its ad. herence to them, while reserving the right of examining the resolutions and obligations which may be the result of the negotiations, particularly with refference to the special conditions comprised in these propositions. The project concludes by expressing the hope that Austria and Prussia will continue to eroploy their good offices in promoting the interest of their common country. I may observe that thWs last passage is said to have been added by Count Buol. In one instance, at all events, the Paris Conferences even before their commencement have produced some benefit. I allude to the question of the refugees. A decree will soon be published by the Austrian Government, which divides the Lombardo-Venetian refugees into two classes, excluding such as have suffered pains and penalties of a corporal kind inf9icted in coure of a legal sentence. One class comprises those who within a year will decide on preserving the Austrian nationality, and the other applies to those who make the choico at once of a foreignnationality. Theformner will be allowed to return to their country, and re-enter on the possemsion of the property which is sequestrated. The latter will be required *. dispose of the property they possess in Austia. This- measure is attributed to the infuence of Eon>nd and Frhnce; it seems a sort of qualification forthe Conferences, and at all events it will enable Auatria i2 take part in them much more at her ease with respect to Sardinia. It is'denied that Austria et'tempted to exclude the Piedniontese Plenipoten tiaries from the Conferences. I have this day been assured thtat wrarlUe pre-d parations in France are continued just a*if no Conferences were about to be opened. The Patrie has received the following tekgeaphic despatch "BRUSSELS, EZB. Is-Count OrIoff arrived here y-eirday at 10 o'clock p.m. He will probably be received to. morrow by the King, and leave in the evening for Paris.6 The Emperor yesterday received the Earl of Clarendon, English Minister for Forei.i Affairs,and Plenipotentiary to the Conferences which are about to be opened at Paris. The Earl of Clarendon was introduced to His Imperial Majesty by the Grand Master of the Ceremonies, and presented !ky Lord Cowley, the Britis Ambassador. Count W.-ewski, Mlinister of Foreign Affairs, was in attendance at the presentation. In, the course of the day, the Emnperor also receivei;at a public audience Btron de Grancy, who has heretofore exercised the fumcions of resident Minister of the Grand Duke ef Heesn, and the Baron hacl the helo'r of presenting letters accrediting him to' the French Court as Envroy-Extraordinary and Miniiter-Plemipotentiary of the Grand Diuke of Hesse. We read in the Constiftitiomwae,- " For an object which may be readily understood, some foreign jourmals, in announcing the arrival in Paris of Baron de Brunow, have related that onr enteringtlae railway terminus the Russian Plenipotentiary was the object cf a kind of ovation, and that the poLice were even obliged to interfere for the purpose of dispersing the numerous assemblages which hadk collected there, and in front of the hotel where 3L de Branow alighted. The authors of these accounts, in order to cary the fertility of their imagination to its fullest extent, added that a bouquet was thrown to M1. de Brunow, and that cries of "Vivc r Bwssie " had been raised. It is needless to insist on the absurdity of these recitals, which are com. pletely untrue. ML de Brunow arrived in Paris at 10 o'clock at night, when the terminus was deserted, and irmediately, without being in any way remarked, entered the carriage of IL de Seebacb, the Saxon Minister." We read in the Mon itcwir de la Flotte "Our private correspondence, received rid Constantinople, brings accounts from th e coast of Asia of the 3dinst. The winter, although verycold in that part of the Black Sea, had not been so rigorous as in the region of the Dnieper, and the thermometer had never fallen under 15 degrees centigrade below the freezing point. At the last date the temperature had considerably improved. The French gunbrig Vigie was stationed at Trebizond, and an English ship of war, with a vessel of the Ottoman navy, -was lying at Batomu. The north and north-westerly wivnds had raged with extreme violence along the neighbouring coast during the month of January, but without occasioning any disasters at sea. Their effect, however, had manifested itself in a inore disastrous manner on shore, particularly on the high table land. A snowstorm had continued there during 10 hours with frightful intensity, and proved fatal to a Russian convoy on its way to carry provisions to the small garrison left at liars by General Mouravieff. A detachment of 75 men perished in the snow, which accumulated as high asthe wals of the place. It was said that the divisions of the Russian army, encamped in the mountains had also greatly suffered, that their communications were interrupted with the remainder of the country, and that their supplies were nearly cut off. The acceptance by the Emperor Alexander of the peace propositions had been officially made known to the Russian authorities in Georgla, Armenia, and the Caucasian provinces, where the announcement had produced the best possible effect. The public feeling in that respect appears to be general, and the successor of the Emperor Nicholais becoming daily more popular. The English steam corvette Miranda was within sight of the coast, coming from SebastopoL She was said to have been placed at the disposal of General Williams, whose exchange was demanded by his Government. The health of the General and of the other English and Turkish officers, taken prisoners at Kars, was excellent, and they were treated with al the attention due to their courage. The aituntion of tho Ottoman army, commanded by Omar Pasha, and encamped at Batoum and Redout Kaleh, was al that could be desired. Theso troops iwerv abundantly supplied with provisions, and had satisfactorily got over the winter." M. de Gigandes, Colonel of Artillery, who lately arrived from the Crimea, where he took an active part in the labours and perils of the siege of Sebastopol, died at Marseilles on the 15th inst.

The ever-cautious German Cois frederation is not likely to pledge itse}f to maintain the five posits wi efl amis, but it will agree to consider the first four ponts the unstlterable basis of peace, and accept the fifth "with the limited explanation given to it by Aastria."

St has exacited attentionherethat allPrussl n correspondents appear to entertain doubts of the sincerity of Russia, and one of them, who writes for the nu'seutrg Giszete makes the following remark: If it wias the sole object of the Russian Government to gain time, and to win ever tha Plenipotentiaries of its antagonists, as it did Lord John Rusoell and f Dronun do ehtys at Vienna, it couid not act otherwise than it,s noto dain. This relaection is often aade in very influential circles, and the oant of confidenca in the future is the greater, because w.e are no longer so exactly informed of the intentions of the Rusian Government as we wel re when Count Ounster T ss alitasy Plenipotentiary at St. Petrsburg."p The Doau hch has received someinfortation fromSt. Petersburg which iS of interest, although it reFers to bygone matters. Ads you long since learnedfrom me, thenewsof the aliance between the Western Powlers and Sweden made averygreat impression onrthe l.us sian Court, and some of the Czar s mlitably advisers where of opinion that warought to be declaredagaiust beg Oscar. The question was discussed in a Council ,of Wanr which was held at St. Petersburg, but General von Berg, the Governor of Fi5nland, settled the matter by declaring that if war was declared he would not answer for theibehviour of the inhabitants of theprovince entrusted to his care, tnless the army then in ianland received a reinforcement of n0,000 men. It .as finilly resolved to take no notice of the Smedish treaty, which probably was the wisest thing that could f nder the eircam3tances be done. It must not be supposed that the Bussians are standing with folded arms while the negotiatious forpeace are going on. The fortifications and preparations for defence are continued writh the greatest energy on all parts of the Baltic and Gu'f of Finland, and more particularly in the neigh- a bourhood of Ryga and Swcaborg.

The Plenipotentiaries are beginningto follow each other rapidly. Count Orloff and Anli Pasha have :not Iet made their appearance, but the former will be Jure to-morrow, and the latterperhaps on Thursday. Lord Clarendon arrived at past midnight last night, and has taken up his quarters at the Hotel de Louvre. Count Vuol came about two hours earlier; he is lodged at the Hotel Bristol, Place Vehdome. The latter is accompanied by Baron 31eyaenburg, 1. de Kletzl, Count Czeceny, Secretary of Legation, and by A. Buhl and BaronWerner 2a secretanes. Among ther diplomatic strangers I may mention Maron D derstr;m, the newly-appointed Swedish 3 1initer, who arrived at 2 o'clock this afternoon from LVienna. Lord Clarendon, in company with Lord Cowley, who also returned last night, had an audience of the Emperor to-day. None other of the Plenipotentiaries have as yet conferred with His Majesty; theirturn will come in due order. Count Buol 'ill be presented to-morrow. I believe the priority in this respect was not without intention, and perhaptit was 3meant that the representative of the ally who has shared from the beginning in the sacrifices which the war has cost should, so far as -that circumstance may be considered as an honour, -sti have the first place. The most earnest pro--fesions are made in official quarters here of the -wish and determination of the Emperofs Govern-ment tormaintain the alliance withEngland through-out. From what I see I do not think it possible the Conferences can begin before Saturday, and I .believe nothing positive has as yet been decided -with reference to detail in conducting themn. As astters stand at present, the chances are decidedly -in favour of a pacieic solution, and the incredulous -are sensibly diminishing. I hesitate to give an .opinion on this subject, and I doubt whether any one can say more than that the chances are favourable until after the firSt eight or ten. days of the -Conferences. RUSSI. We have received the St. Petersburg journals of the 9th inst. The Tournal de St. Petersboutrg publishes an Im-perial manifesto, announcing the marriage of His Jsajesys brother, the Grand Duke Nicholas, to the Grand Duchess Alexandra Petrowna (Princess *of Oldenburg). The Gazette publishes a long list of promotions in -the army on the occasion. All the Imperial Grand Dukes are appointed Aides-de-Camp-General to the Emperor, retaTiing their other honours and ap- poTtments. A letter from St. Petersburg, of the Oth, in the - n.ititteticrnne, says - "The marriage of the Grand Duke Nicholas with his cousin, the Princess Alexandra Petrowna, of Oldenburg, took place to-day. At early dawn the firing of cannon and -the ringing of bells announced the opening of the fte. Although an official programme of the proceedungs had been published, it is not the one, you may be assured, which Will be carried into effect.

General officers in full uniform, Ministers, members of the cGarps diptomatique, civil and military functionaries, the members of the arLstocracy, and the wives of the ambassadors and grand dignitaries, glittering with diamonds and eaveloped in the richest furs, were seen flockingtowards one point-theWimterPalace. Thestreets and qutys were covered by an immense crowd. and theweatherwassomildthat the. people could without inconvenience to themselves stand still and witness the equipa,es passing. In the large state saloon of thelTmter Palace the invited guests found assembled all the Imperial familyand several foreign princes, relatives or friends of the Grand Duchess.

Gount Valentine Estereazy also appeared amid the glittering throng for the first time at one of the Court gaLis.

The invited guests then left the palace, to retwn in the evening to a grand banquet and concert. It was at first intended that there should be asplendid bali, for which invitations had been issued, but the death of Marshal PasLdewitsch caused this arrangement to be chsaged, and a concert was substituted for it. If the weather this evening is as fine as it has leen during the day the streets wilM be thronged during the whole night. To-d%y and for the next few days it will be useless to discuss here the question of peace or war, as the rejoicings for the marriage will be the exclusive object of attention.; the *Crimea, the Westerm Powers, and the Conferences of Paris sre for the moment nearly forgotten." SARDINIA. (pnor O1JR OwW COP.BESPONDEST.) TURIN, FER. 14. Some additional particulars of the forthcoming A,strian amnesty have transpired to-day. It appears that, with few exceptions, it is intended the amnesty shall be general and unconditional; that it is to be made known individually to those whom it may concern by Austrian authorities in foreign countries, and not by an Imperial decree. Those who choose to re-enter and reassume their citizenship wil at once be put into possession of their property. Those who do not choosetoreturnmaydemand permission to sell their property; and the property of those who do not choose to do either before the end of 1856 will be handed over to their lawful heirs and successors; but it is not intended in any case to confiscate properties to the Crown. It is reported here, on very good authority, that the Austrian Government has also been exercising -it,s influence on the Courts of Rome and Naples to induce them tomnake similar concessions. Yesterday Count Cavour announced officially to the Chamber of Deputies his own appointment by His Majesty as Minister Plenipotentiary for Sardinia at the, Paris Conference, and that of AL Lanza as ad interim Mrinister 1-4 f l-.. _ o 1 in the evening he left by the last train for Susa, accompanied by MM. Cavour (his nephew), Centurione, and Nigra. The Chamber of Deputies voted yesterday, by 82 -votes to 29, the estimates of expenditure for 1856, aniounting to 140,8'7,054f. The Senate still continued the discussion on the Usaury 3Bill without coming to a division. A Royal decree, bearing date February the 13th, determines the interest on Treasury Bonds to be - isaued on the i1thinst. to be 4percent. for those of from 3 to 6 months, and 5 per cent. on those of from 7 to 12. This being the anniversary of the death of the 3uke of Genoa, funeral services were performed in the churches of the Superga and St. Lorenzo, by order of the Duchess, his widow.

The virtual effect, at the present time, of this abuse is to impose on all British travellers or residents in tius ldngdom who derive their income from their native country an income-tax considerably exceeding in amount that which is now imposed by our own Government for the support of the war. The abuse in question consists in this -that the Neapolitan Ilint, instead of paying as other Mints pay, the actual equivalent of silver, with an infinitesimial deduction; only, to repay Mint expenses, has been converted icto a heavy source of profit, illegitimate and unusual, and bearing most onerously on foreigners. The present price fixed by the 2Neapolitan Mint for pure silvei is about 4s. sterling per lb. leM than its actual value. The injustice hasbeen ofgradul growth-say, within the last 15months, and has completely deranged the exchanges between the two countries." I refrain from repeating the minute and accurate, details which you have already published, and shall content mysel with stating one broad fact resulting from this shameless fraud:- "1 The actual par of exchange, basingthe calculation on an equivalent in pure ilver, may be taken at 578 grains per pound sterling. But the present rate of exchange is 522 grains per pound sterling, or 10 per cent. blow par I Of this difference the Neapolitan Government retains 8f per cent. profit for on their coinagc." The remonstrance concludes with the assurance that " The undersigned disclaim all intention of complaining of thle abiue in question,except as it directly affects themselves. Viewed in reference to Reapoliton subjects or their in. terests, it is purely a domestic question; but, taken in connexion with the annual tax it imposes on foreigners, it is clearly an international one. As such, it is respectfully submitted to your Excellency for such action as you think proper, or for reference to the British Government." After such an appeal as this the question is thrown completely into the hands of the British authorities, and it is impossible to believe that so ggross a violation of international law, and one so heavily affecting the interests of British subjects, wil fail to receive the deepest and most urgent attention. Indeed, it is a matter of great surprise that a line of conduct which, as between man and man, would be denounced as infamous and fraudulent, should have been so long permitted to this country. Bywhat right divine is it that the Neapolitan Government, after outraging common justice and humanity in the treatment of its own subjects, i proceeds to levy black mail on those who cross the frontiers of the kidn dom ? It is time that this and various other abuses should be inquired into and I put a stop to; and most devoutly is it to be hoped that the grievance will be so clearly explained to, anld sO strongly urged upon the attention of His Sicilian Majesty that he will himself at once perceive the justice of the remonstrance and remove the cause. have spoken of it in this letter as a ques- tion betwveen Great Britain and the Two Sicilies; I but let it not be forgotten that Francead the United States and every other country whose subjects, either as merchants or visitors, have relations with this kingdom are equally the victims of the fraud. Nor is there any limuitto it. Thrice since November, 1854, has the Mint price of silver been reduced. A Royal rescrHtto remains in force which confers on the Minister of Finance tho powver to continue these half-yearly reductions, and if we are to judge the future from the past theywillbecon- inued. WVhat, then, is to limit this arbitrary imposition? Nothing, it would seem, except the conscience' (alas! a forlorn hope) of this Governnent or the impatience of foreign'ones. Let, tllerefore, the British Government take the initiative, and let there be a combined action on the part of al other Governments interestedto insist on the abandonment of a line of conduct so detrimental to the interest of all classes, whether natives or foreigners, and so completely in violation of iniernational law as well as of common honesty. I must not omit a prompt act of grace performed by His Majesty on the request of the British MiEnister. A British sailor, ina row withaSicilian, struck him a blow which killed. The man, called Grandy, was tried by the Grand Criminal Court at Girgenti, and condemned to 13 yeams' imprisonment in irons; an application was made to Sir William Temple, who lost no time in applying to Cassisi, the Minister for Sicilian Affairs in Naples. By him it was referred to the King, who, on the 2d of February, immediately granted a free pardon, on condition of his leaving the kingdomn. In ourown courts it would havebeen brought in homicide, as there was no zazlZzee prepene in tho a|fliair;- but, novertheless, there was a promptness in the pardon which makes it gracefu'l. Our Carnival terminated in a quarrel between the Spanish MIinister and a Swiss officer. WVho was in the wrong it is difficult to say. The officer challenged the AMinister, and is now in arrest, but threatens to horsewhip him on being liberated. SPAN. (ERo0r OUR OWN CORPESPONDxNT.) AtrA llID, FEB 13. The scheme of the now Finance Minister for making up to the Treasury the deficit which the repeal of the excise duties on produce (consumos) will produce was read yesterday in the latter part of the sitting, and is published to-day. The Minister withdrew that part of the budget, but proposes to maintain the gate dues levied on provisions, &c., and to-extend them to all the provincial capitals and qualified seaports. The dulties formerly paid by these articles will be modified and somewhat reduced; they embrace wine, spirits, oil, vinegar, meat, lve animals and birds, charcoal, sugar, fruits, &c. Senor Santa Cruz calculates that 60,000,000 reals will be received from this source, and proposes to make up whatever deficiency may exist in the ways and means of 1856 and Srst half of 1857, according to the budget of his predecessor, by an impost to be levied onall other towns, &c., not subject to pay the above duties at the gates, to be apportioned by the Government on each province according to the wealth and produce of the same, and to be distributed and levied by the provincial deputations and corporations, by imposing taxes on particu3ar articles, granting for a stipulated sum the exclusive right to sell by retail various articles, increasing the property-tax and that on trades and professions, and, finally, leaving thestum requiredtobe madeup to beassessed by the householders amongthemseIves. Thecorporate authorities are authorized to adopt these means jointly or separately. This project of law does not seem to have prodluced generally a very good effect. It is spoken of asmerely continuing the former system under a diferent name; but, as the Cortes had passed a resolution that permanent means must be provided for meeting the expenses according to the estimates for 18a5 and half of 1857, it might be difficult to find any other way of realizing the amount required that would not be open to equal objections, tariff reform,the simplest and least onerous way in which the revenue might be inCoooa ,l Q i l-S.ot o..toh, bvlug opposed by such combined interests as to be a thing more to be desired than expected-at least, to such an extent as would efficiently extinguish the deficit. The Cortes wrill probably pass the bill if the Goverunment insist upon it. At the Bolsa to-day the Three per Cents. were done at 37 95, and the Deferred ditto at 23 65.
SM W. CIAY'a CHwMa RATxSs ABoLrroN BiM.- Sir W. Clay's bill "to abolish church rates, and to make other provisions in lien thereof," was printed yesterday. It enacts the total abolition of the impost of church rates in Englond and Wales after the passing of the act, with a proviso saving sums borrowed on clhurchrates. The churchwardens of parishes are, by clause 3, empowered to receive and collect voluntary contributions for the purposes of the parish churcb, but no disbursement must be made without the approval of auditors, who are to be elected annually (to the number of five), of whom one will be elected by the incumbent, and the other four by the inhabitants in vesr assembled. The auditorsamust be owners or occupiers of ,eS in the parish church, or adult mnale comamunicants at =hesaid church or some chapel of ease duly licensed by the bishop, and no auditor must be interested in the supply of materialr, Lc, for the church. The auditors wi meet twice a-year to approve and allo* the estimates and to pass the accounts of the churchwardens; aud the latter are to prepare estimates of the current expense. The accountg must be open to public inspection. Official disputeg are to be decide by the ordinary. Balances in hand are to be given over to succeeding wardens. The act will not extend to the two sister ldngdomst.

AAMEZCJ. A . [A summary of the followin-. received by Eleclrz Telegraph, appeared in or Second Edition of yeste -- LIVERPOO, MoNDY. - The Boyal mall steamship Africa, Captain Shanvon, arrived this morning with advices from New York to the 6th inst. She has onlreigiht $303,941 Wc have no aivals of stemers at New York to report. Conorems was organized on the 2d, through the pluraitv method, by the election of hIr. Banks. The final balot stood-Banks, 103; Aiken, 100; Scattering, 11. Subsequent to the declaration of the result,andtheannouncementbythetellersofMr.Banks'* majority, objections were started by the KnowNothings as to the legality of the whole proceeding, whereupon a resoluftion endorsing the action of the Houso was offered and adopted. The lobbies of the House were crowded to suffocation, and the excitement was inereased by the startling cry that $ boy was being crushed to death by the pressure iff the galleries. Some of the members shouted out, "F all backl" " Fallback!" and others, " Handhim over the rail " The boy was at length released from his imminent danger. Deafening shouts of applause from the Republican side and other quarters of the House greeted the announcement of Mr. Banks's election, and in the galleries ladies waved their handkerchiefs. For several minutes the disorder was beyond description. On the 4th the formality of swvearing in the members took p lace. The UJnion, official organ, thus speaks of mr. Banks's election.- "Although' the resullt is one that every rational man must regret, yet, as the Republicans have a known majority in the house, ard therefore are entitled to a Speaker, there is reason for acquiescing, inasmuch as it enables the machinery of Government once more to move on." In the Senate, on the 5th, the CentrallAmerican Question was again under discussion, Mr. Foote being the principal speaker. His speech, as condensed for teleg7raphing,7 was to the following effect:- "Though not an admirer of lMr. Buchanan, he took pleasure in eulogizing the arguments advanecd by that gentleman to sustain the views he entertained of the proper construction of the BEiwer-Clayton Treaty. He regarded' the reasoning of Mr. Buchan asasound andof consummate ability. The faithfbul observance- of the treaty requres 'of Her XbijesWs Government the immediate withdrawal from any occupancy of, or dominion over, any portion of the Mosquito territory or sea coast, by virtue of a pretended protectorate. Te claims of England' over Central America and the Bay Islands being founded upon no right of discovery, conquest, purchase, or treaty, her occupationof the territory is consequently a clear case of forcible entry and detainer, and her right the same that a' highwayman has to pursue an unarmed traveller. He maintained that the honour of this country, no less than its interests, demands that we shall insist upon England's fulfilling her treaty stpulations. The idea of yielding to the Pretensions of that Government, and allowing her to evaeeitsplain provisions, is not to be thought of for a moment. He proposed that a direct Congressional declaration be made of our construction of fthe treaty, and of our pUrPOse to enforce the obligation result. ing from that construction. If this prove unavailing. and after negotiation shall' have been exhausted, he would entertain a proposiMion similar to that sog'ested by Mr. Seward-namely, to give England official and formal notice that she muast withdraw; from her Central American occupations by a given day; if then she holds out, and disregards all our sumnmons, ho would have her removed by force of arns. Let England understand that we are in earnest about this, and that it is not a second edition of ' fifty-four, forty or fight,' and then backing down to forty-nine. If, after so much forbearance, war comes, let it come. We shall be iustified both by God and man." - The organization of Congress had occasioned the usual scra2nble by office-seekers. It is best described by a Washington correspondent:- " rx. Glosbrenner, after a severe and exciting straggle, to-day was re-elected Sergeant-at-Arns. This was a sad disappointment to the Black Republicans. Nathan Darling was elected doorkeeper. Johnston, the postmaster, was 'overslaughed.' The contest for printer waxes hotter - the excitement this evening is intense. Wendle says his chance is sure, while, on the other hand, the Opposition say they will head him 20 votes. The respective fends of several clergymen are pressing with great earnestness their peculiar qualfications for the chaplaincy. The contest for printer and chaplain comes off to-morrow. Quite a num7cerostook place to-day. There is to be a general slaughter about- the Capitol in a few days. Ira Goodnow, lieutenant of police in New York, wams appointed assistant doorkeeper, 'The pressure for appointments is awful. The area round the Hall of Representatives was crowded this afternoon with hundreds of office-seekers, wshile otherssoughtrefugein the rotundo of the Capitol Memibers, before and even during the session of the House, were constantlv signinf agplicauts? papers. No sooner had Captain Darling qualified as doorkeeperthan he removed a messenger and appointed hissuccessor. This served as asignalfortthe crow inside to rush upon him with importunities, and the scene of excitement was heightened on the adjournmentof the House by the rushing in of tho office-seeldeg forcee ewuaide." The New York Tribune compares the success of the Banks party to the battle of Waterloo-. "Waterloo was gained by the unflinching and unconquerable steadiness of the British battalions, whicb, drawn up in squares, defied all the French charges, till Blucher at last appearing on the French flank, and Bonaparte able to wait no lon-er for Grouchy to come up, ordered the last desperate cAarge of the Old Guard, which parting 'like the rest, the route became total-not the bhatle only being lost, but the Imperial throne along with it. Just so the Republcans at Washingtonfirm as a rock against all assaults, whether in the House or from without the ouse, aainst open violence and secret treachery, against cannona1es by avowed enemies and undenninings by pretended friends-endured it all mQst manfully; till the Administrtion traders, pressed by the clamours of a host of unpaid -officials, satisfied that the Northern Know-Nothings, much as they might wish it, did not dare to come up to the scratch, and clutching at the hope of making Mr. Aik-en Speaker, consented to the plurality rule, charged desperately at the head of the Old Guard, dashed fiercely and confidently on the Republican squares, which in vain they attempted to break, rolled back in confusion, and fled the field." The Washington correspondent of the New York Herald says it " has leaked out of the State Departanent' that the FrenchGovernment had assumed a position in relation to certain Russian vessels that had been transferred since the commencement of the Eastern war to citizens of the United States, being at the time of the transfer in American ports, which it was likely would " make difficulty unless the President faints." A list of the vesselshad been furnished to the United States' Minister to France, and the determination avowed on the part of the French and English Governments to hold them as lawful prizes of war if they are captured. According to the correspondent, " Mr. Mason, it is reported, exhibits some apprehension on the subject." The Irislunen charged at Cincinnsti with Fillibustering desgns against Ireland had been acquitted. MIdlle. RacheI had reached New York, enw rodte for France vid England. The Government of Granada had demanded of the United States7 Government that her Minister at Washington shoulld be apprised of the intention to transport United States' troops, in order that the Governor of Panama, being advised of the fact, might be able to distinguish Fillibusters from boud fide troops. It also demanded that 'United States' troops on transit through the territory should conform to the civil laws of the country.

BArK OF FWANCE. TO THE EDITOR OF TBE TIlES. Sir,-Yn remarking on the just published accounts of this institution, some of your contemporaries, noticing that the protested bills are only 16,121f., have inferred that the bad ebts of the barnkare represented by this small amount; but, to the astounding of every one who will look at the third item on the creditor side, there appear "commercial bills overdue, 496,377,016f. !'-an amount greater than the whole stock of bills not yet due, and more than five times as great as the capital of the banks lInm. Sir YOIUR CONSTANT READER. Feb. 16.
SO THE EDITOR OF THE IES. Sir,-Oa Thursday evening Lord Ellenborough drew the attntion of the House of Peers to a petition from some seamen, complaining that they were often subject to hardships and legal penalties, arising from the unseaworthiness of .ships which thev Lad joined in ignorance of theircondition; also, of others being undermanned; and higs Lordship took occas.on to quote from the report of an inspector of prisons, which, I believe, he wonld find very great difficulty in substantiating. liow, practically, there is no sailor worth his salt who cannot, from the nature of the trade in which a ship is engaged, her looks, age, owners, and other undeniable tests, let aloha Lloyd's Registry, tel the character and conditionof the ship he sails in. As for beingundermanned, Eng'ash ships inraably carry larger crews than American ones; and no shipowner in the long run ever proftedby overworking his men. The fact is that the present race of sailors has greatly degenerated With few exceptions, they are a most abandoned set, living while on shore at the mercy of crimps, and their wages for months after they go afloat, mortgaged to redeem the robberies and exacions while in those dens of infamy. lNo sooner do they join a ship than they try to find o*t s me loophole to get ashore, and by all sorts of infamnous accusations endeavour to saddle the vessel with m&any serious expenses; but invariably, when the trick is discovered, and they are rewarded with 12 weeks' imprisonment and hard labour, cry peccavi, and offer to retaur to duty. To satisfy Lord Ellenborough and other philanthropists that I don't write off the book-the Donald Mdackay returned the day before yesterday to the Mersey, after being 24 hours' at sea. Inconsequence of being tender, and rather than overwork his people by adjusting his ballast at sea, the captain came back to the river to altr his trim. Yesterday morning, 32 of the crew refused to turn to, on the plea thlat she was undennanned;- this being the first intimathon ofsuch a discovery. CaptainWVarner remonstrated in vain-came ashore, got warrants, a posse of police -went off, and brought the refractory lot before the stipendiary maristrate, who, after a minute investigation gave them 12 weeks' and hard labour. This morning, a solicitor auplied for a memorial to Sir George Grey to emancipate these worthies, as they were now quite wlling to go on board, having discovered their mnscalculation of beating the captain. Alas, poor Jack! the reply was, that respect for his morals forbade te idea of shortenin- his captivity. I only wish Lord Ellenborough could be induced to buy a ship andmanage her for one voyage. If the romance of " simple-minded tars " be not dissipated by such an experiment, ral forfeit my head. Yours, obediently, T. xi MACKAY. Liverpool, Feb. 16.
A FUG'rrivE SLAvE 3h IaVEmPOoL.-The Aaerican shlip Asterion, Captain Day, which arrived in the Mersey on Saturday evening, brought to the free shores of England a slave woman, under xather peculiar oircumstalic'. It appears that, while tho ship was loading in Y-Nw Orleans, . - poor creature made her escape, whereupon her imster oifered a reward of $0 to any one who wold restore to him his " property." The police, as is usual in such cases, made strict search throughout the city and on boarl the veaselsin the harbour, bxtsheeluded theirvigilanc4, and found a frisnd in the shii's boatswain, -who secretly conveyed her on board the Asternon, and kept her in his berth during the whole of the passage, which occupied about 2C5 days. The Estraugest part of the affair is, that, wtith the exception of her liboerutor, the boatswvain, her presence in the ship Was unknown to the captain, officers, and crev. lVhen t1h vecsel anchored in the Mfersey, the Custom-house officers went on board, and, while one of themn was rumin "in in the boatswain'sberth, he found her concealed amoug the bedclothes, in a state of nudity, having on only a waist'elt and a turban. Wearing apparel was soon provided, and she was removed on shore and taken to a boarding-house in Queen-street; a free woman. She is a mulatto about 20 or 25 years of age, was tidily attired, and appeared to have been well treated during the voyage. The boatswain and the whole of the crew of the Asterion are coloured men.- Liverpool Albion. THEE ART UlNoNv Or GnAsaow.-This institution, to obviate the complaints of the late delivery of prints to its subscribers, is about to issue in len of one large engraving which would take upwards of twoyears to print, two of smaller size, which, while admitting of more rapid execntion, wi maintain the highest standard of excellene as impressions, and each beof greater value than the amount of scription. Tho subjects selected for engraving this year are Cope's "Eirst Born," executed by T. Vernon,I and W. T. Leitche's "Villa Fountain," Iengraved by W. Forrest. Both are admirable specimens of line engraving. and will sustain the pro-eminence which inl tblt respect the Art Union of Glasgow has established over its London fival. The committee of manigeineut publish a numuerous list of paintings bought for distribution as prize at the Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, and WorcestrExhibitions, It appears that Glasgow has no exhibition of the kind this year, having no building suitable for the purpose. The list referred to is stiU incomp ete, the' purchases at the Edinburgh and London Exhibitions yet remaining to be efected.

' - - - -- -- ifondayE-velng This being the day for the ailnounoement of the conditions of the new loan, tho tnglish funds have experienced considerable fluctuation. Consols for money, which left off on Saturday at 901 to J, wera first quoted 901 to A, whence, in consequenoo of somo heavy sales, they declined to 904. Theythen recovered to 901, but presented an unsettled appear; ance irutil a telegraphic message from the west-end notified that the loan is to be for only 5,000,000., -when a sudden rise took place to 91 to J. It haW not been statea that there was als to be a funding of 3,000,000 of Exchequer-bills, and -when this ad; ditional intelligenoe was received the market partially lost its buoyancy, anll a reaction oocTred toi 901 to 91, which was the final quotation. For the account the last price was 91t to J. The favour. able effect produced by the smallness of the loan was to some extent counteracted by the haste with which it is to be called up, the interval between the payment of the deposit of 20per cent. on Tuesday next and the fina instalmentbeingscarcelymore than eight weeks. The lastloan was calledaup at an averaga rate of about a million a fortnight, while in the prement instance the average will be about a million and a quarter a fortnight, and its influence, there. fore, as regards the demand for money and the pressure of new stock on the market, during tho short period over which the operation is to extend, will be much greater, although the amount is only 5,ooo,ooo0., than thatwhichwasproduced within any correspondingperiodbytheloanforl6,000,000!.Thera is no doubt, however, that any material disturbance caused by it from time to time in the money-market will be limited to a day or two about the date of each instalment, since al the payments will be disbursed by the Government nearly as fast as they are received. It is understood that Messrs. Rothschild intend to open a list both for the new loan and the funding of Exchequer-bills, and that & circular to that effect will be issued to-morrow. NO other list has been spoken of. The assumed certainty that a fresh loan will be required before Midgsummer, and the fact that peace is not yet concluded, however confidently it may be anticipated, will render capitalists extremely calutioas as to the terms which should now be offered. Banlk Stockl left off at 213i to 2141 ; Ee-e duced, 91t to #; New Three per Cents., 9li tGi 92; Long Annuities, 3i; Annuities, 1885, 162; India Stock, 223 to 226; India-bonds, 7s. to 3s. discount; and Exchequer-bonds, 971 to 98. Exchequer-bills were improved by the proposition for funding, and the closing quotation was 2s. discount to2s. premium. .The demand for money to-day was rather less urgent, but still nothing was obtainable below the Bank rate. Foreign securities exhibited firmness, but the operationi were unimportant. An advance of J to 1 per cent. took place in Turkish, which was fairly maintained. In the Six per Cents. the transaction3 were at 93 for money, and 93k, b, and 94 for the account. The Four per Cent. Guaranteed Stock was dealt in at 100, 1001, and i. The other bargains comprised-Brazilian Small, 103; Ecuador, 5; Granada Deferred, GU; Mexican, for account, 20-; Russian Five per Cents., 105; Spanish Three per Cents., for accotnt, 42iS and J-; the New Deferred, for account, 23i andi; Venezuela, 28k, 29lt, and 28; the Deferred, 12; and Datch Twoand-a-Half per Cents., W3k. The final quotation of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening failed to arrive, but the opening transactions for the end of the month were at 73f. SXc., showing a decline of an eighth. The continental alvices continue to describe a satisfactory appearance of the exchanges. At Paris there has apparently been a slght mitigation of the pressure for money, the rates of continuation on the Bourse having become more moderate. At Ianburg the charge for discount is 53 per cent. There was a numerous attendance of capitalists al the Treasury to-day to receive information with regard to the proposed loan and funding of Exche. quer-bills.

"'The deposit wil be 20 per cent, on the 26th of February, 1856; and the instkaments- 20 per cent. on the 13th of March. 30 per cent. on the 29th of March. 20 per cent. on the 10th of ApriL 10 per eent. on the 24th of ApriL " The contractors for the loan to have the option of contracting for the Exchequer-bill funding on the same terms as shall be accepted for the loa. " In the event of the contractors wishing for an option to pay money, instead of Exchequer-bills, it will be received at 1001. 5s. money for every 1001. of Exchequer-bills." In ansuwer to questions from Baron Rothschild, M1r. L. Cohen, and others, it was sated. by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the total amount of the mifunded debt in existence is about 23,000,0001., and that no discount will be allowed for prepayment of instalments, the shortness of tha period over which they are spread rendering it unnecessary. Shouldthe parties who take the loan refuse the option offered in coimexion with the proposed funding, the Government, it was said, willv when the biddings are made on Friday, state the terms they are prepared to accept. With referenoo to the payment of instalments, Baron Rothscild wished to understad clearly whether contractorawould bo liablo after the payment of the deposit. In the late case of the Turkish Loan, some subscriberi not having paid upon their rxip on the precise day he instaent fell due, the Bank of England apphed immediately afterwards to the contractors to make good the amount. The sum was not large, but if suich a precedent were to be etablisheditmight lead to inconvenience. In oidi. Lpxy tmuwtigs tho holders -of thc scrip, after
RAILWAYt IM BENCE. R - <3REAT ITORTRER. The directors of this eomany have just L'cued their report. It states that 11,267,09Th had been received on shares and loans, and 11,061,5192. had been expended, inClujin 155,802. during the alf-year, leaving a balance fin cas ' securitiesof205,5782L Thegrossearnhsintbehialfyearhave I beenO2S,9i61, beingan increase of48,i27r. above that earned j in the corregpondingperiod of 185. The gross exenditur for the half-year amounted to 3084122., orbl,724abovethat of the correspondingperiod of 1854. The balance of earnings beyond expenses is 720,7' .; bein larger by 14,003h. than the balance at the en orf 1854 . 'rom the 320,7732. is. deducted 185,4611. for Interest on loans, tho payment of rcnts, and other fixed cha,ges, and dividends on the various preference stocks, leaving 145,3654. available for dividends on the original stock on the B and A stocLk, and is largerby 60844 than the balance available for similar dividends to December, 1854.. The working expenses in obtaining the increase of traflic have beens greater in proportion to the receipts than in 1854. Derides the increase in wrorking expenses the addition to capital of 600.0002. raised lBy the issue of the 5 per cent. redeemable preference stock of the 12th of December, 1854. has becomne a further charge upon ithe net revenue of 13,02, and haste be deducted therefrom2 The available balance admits of a dividend upon the originaL stock at the rate of 6 per cent. per annun, or, for the halfvear, 3 per cent. ; on the B stock, of 31 percent. for the half-year, making 0 per cent, for the year 1855; and upon the A stock 2' per cent for the year 1855t, leaving a surplus of 1122. Th%e dividend upon the original stock for the year 1855 is at the rate of e4per cent. They stak that if the cornmny had kept all it had earned, instead of paying over 31,-2141. to the London and North-estern and Midland Companies, under the " Gladstone award," and 29,8671. to other raily companies under the "octuple aIree ment," the dividend on the original stock would have ken at the rate of about 52. Ss. per cent forthe year 1855. The report goes on to state that " Both these agreements terminated with the year 1855. A new arrangement, embracing a more equitable distribution among the several comrnes engaged in the trafflo to and from the north and with Scotland, came into operation on the 1st of January, 1856, and promised to work for the mutual benefit of all, and it is hoped may yet be attended with that good resmlt; but for the moment, at least, it is threatened with the serious consequences of an interrotion arising out of the unexpected competition which the London and North-Western, the Midland, and the Mianchester, Sheffield, and LincolnshiroRailway Companies, combined undar private agreements, have recently commenced against the Great Northern Company. "sThese agreements between the Lendeon and North%res.ern, the Midland, and the Manchester, Siheffield, aid Inmcolnshire Comnanies, tben'ghf the&prticulax are not published, are wesr known to have fot their object the preventing any exchange of traffic to and from Manchester-and the district west of -the Mlidland line, thereby depriving the Great Northern Company of a legitjmate share of traffic iin goods and passengers within districts to which the Great' Northern line forms a second and equaUy good route to and from London; and the three companieshaming formedc such a compact against the Great Northern, persist in requirmg the Great Northean to recognize their agreements as the basis and condition precedent to any arrangement for the future regulation and distribution of traffic between them and the Great Northern Company, rendered desirable upon the expiration of the 'GLadstone award,' on the 31st of December, 1855. "T ho origin of the ' Gladstone award' was as follows:Fiveyears ago, to put an tend to the rainous cempetition whih the t'ndon and iorth-Western and theMeidland Companies had adopted, it was agreed to refer to the decision of the Eight Hon. WV. E. Gladstone the proportion, or percentage, of receipts, due to either route, arising from traffic to and from certain six towns-subsequently, by consent, extended to sib other towns,-to which the trains of the London and North-Western and the Midland as well asthose of the-Great Northern, had access. Mr. Gadstone made his award, giving to each company a share of the traffic, with an aUowance of 20 per cent. on anv excess carried by either route beyond the amount award The result has been that under that award the Great Northern earned and paid over to the other companies a net sum of 25,612l. in the year ended June 30, 1855. Bat for the whole;year to December, 1855, the total paid over to the three companies, includin2 aLso payiments under the octun{le agreement to them and to othier companies, exceeded 61,000. The directors felt it their duty to attempt a fresh arrangement, and, in order to discuss a re-distribution of the traffic, the general managers of the four companies met from tim ime; with returns before them, prepared by the railway clearing-house, of the traffic of the four companies, but they could not agree as to the proportons of the redistribution. Subseqaently, negotiations were entered into by deputations of d.rectors from the four companies; these were broken off, and the present competition begun, because the Great Northern declined, and persist in refusing, to recognize as the basis and condition precedent of treating for the future the agreements of and between the three companies, wshich the GIreat Northern directors have never seen. "The Great Northern have made four distinct proposals, all of which have been rejected, and an attempt is made to justify their rejection on the alleged ground that the Great Northern directors disclaim their own actin declining to ratify and adopt the recommendation of their own officer the genera manager, who met the other managers with the clear and previously assented to understanding that 'any sehemeforthedivisronof traffic at which we (they) might arrivewas to be subiectto the approval of our (their several) boards.' Whatever power or anthoritymayhae beengiven to themsnagersoftheotherthreecompanies, thoGfreatNortherm general m.^ater had not, and has not pretended, and does not pretend that he had authority or permnission, directly or mdirectry, from his, the Great Northem boa, or any of its members, to do more than to submit or recommend what he might consider proper terms or conditions for future arrangements or division of the traffic, to be approved of or otherwise dealt with as his own directors might think proper. The Great Northern general m3anager accordingly snbmitted to his directors the minutes of the proceedings at the several meetings he had had with the managers of the other three companies. The Great Northern board objected to, and have since persisted in refusing to adopt or recognize, those minutes. "TAihe long-pendina differences on the subject of the disputed agreements with the South Yorkshire Railway and River Dun Company have been finally dosed. All accounts were first settled, and that company and this company have since, by formal deed, released each other; and arrangements have been for sometimeinoperation bywhich the coal and other traffic over the South Yorkshire line to and fronm Doncasteris carried on with the Great Northern Company on amnicable tenrs. The directors state with pleasure that they have not foumd it necessary to present any bill to Parliament this session. The schools at Doncaster, conducted under the superintendence of the Rev. John Campion, appear to carry out satisfactorily the objects for which they were established. The construction of the main line having been completed by Mr. Joseph Cubitt, as engineer in chief, his engagement with the company terminated with the end of last year, and he will, in future, act as the company's consulting engineer." The auditors, MIessrs. J. Chapman and J. Cattley, state that the accounts of the company reflect great credit on the departmient in which they are kept, and that the accounts of the stores department are balanced, and the stock taken with thegreatest care and accuracy every half-year. The report of Mr. Sturrock states that the extra expense in the locomotive department is due almost entirely to an increase in the train mileage of 196,888 miles, and of 2s. 101d. per ten in the cost of coke. The number of miles run by the engines was 3,05Z2,2, against ,834,07 at the corresponding period of 1854. The consumption of coke averaged 31-41b. per mile. The total working charges, including rates and taxes and Government duty,forthe siX months, amounted to 308,0832., or 48 99 per cent. of the gross receipts, and show an average cost of 2.14s. per mile for the 2,863,416 miles run by the trains. The number of mules worked over by the Great Northern Company was 411, of which M28 miles belong to other companeis. The length of ralway maintained by the company is 311 miles. ROYSTON ANOD EETC11M. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday, at the offices, St. Gelen's-place, and the usul dividend at the rate of h per cent, per annum, for the half-year ending the 31st of December last, wis decared. The meeting then separated. SCINDE. The first annual meeting of this company was held yesterday, at the offices, Gresbam-house, Old Broad-street; Mr. . P. Andrew in the chair. The report, an abstract of which appeared in Zic ltincs of yesterday, was taken as read. The CAllusio, in movig t the aoption ofrthreport,. saidthat, although their preliminary expensa were light their liabilities were considerable. The engineering staff was beig rapidly icreased, prior to commencing operations in India. Be thought their solicitor's charges were very moderate; they did not exceed 1,2002. for preparing the bill and obtaining the act of Parliament including the deed of settlement and all attendances and consultations up to the present time. (H ear, hear.) With regard to their liabilities therewerenowabout4,hetnes ofhmaterials forthepermaneint vay in courseof shipment, andother mattersin course of preparation. Allusion wasmadeto theport of Kurachee in the report,whichmightrequire somefurtherexplanation. During -the south-west monsoon, in June, July, and AkugTust 1853,; several sailing ships, of from 700 to 800 tons, had entered the harbour and left it in safety. This was, of course, the most unfavourable period of the year. In 1854 about the same number of vessels and steamers passed in and out of the harboulr, and they never heard of any accident having occurred. The only difficulty was a bar of soft sand, over which there was 20 feet of water; but the authorities had ordered two large dredging machmnes to be emplojad to remove the obstruction. It was; a landleeked lgrrbour. and capable of affording considerable accomaisodalion to shipping. It was Mr. R. Freer who srggested the Scinde Railway, and he (the chairman) was requested to. take charge of it and carryit out which. they could do with energy and economy. ~Vhen completed it would relieve the traffc of the Indus. The country boats now took from one to two months to reach Hyderabad, and not more than five out of seven arrived there safely, owing to the difficulty of the navigation. The swift steamers su able for the river were not fit to encounter the ocean swell on the voyage to Kunrrachee, hence the advantage of the railway from the latterplace to Hyderabad, which was the point at which the navigation of the river wasgood. His idea was that, by the extension of the railvvy where reqtired, and the use of the navigable portions of the river by .3neans of fast steamers, tho whole line up totlahote in the Punjaub might be worked alternately4by means of the railways where required, said by stamers where the na tion was good. 'L persons accustomed t6 haveDling 00 or 400 miles in 24 hour= it might Gem a very tedious and expensive p3c to hsve transshipments in tncourse of the journ , but wrhen it was considered; that the average rate of traveling in the commtry he illuded to, in India, was10 niies ady, the objection to trnsipping goods, with a iew to sre a large outlay of eajiital, wras not connidzaU especially wrhere the wages of ablebde men did not exceed 3d. or 4d. a-day. That means of communication would be a vast improvement on the present mode; and when the natives apnreciated the value of time more thin at present, or the development of traffic required a more rapid mode of conveyance, railway communication could be completed throughout the whole distance. A very large traffic would come by the railway down to Kur. rac ee, which was 200 rmiles nearer to Aden than any other port, and 700 miles nearer than Bombay. It would be of still greater importanco when the short route to tho interior of India wvas carried out by the Euphrates valley and tho Scfido valley, by which 1,000 mileg would be saved. Tothe accomplishment of this route there were political and social difficulties, but there were no physical difficulties. The Government had recently put ontwo steamers betweenKurrachee and Siez, in orderto testthepracticability of the route. Sir H. MAnDDocr, ALP., seconded the motion, and in doing so said he hoped that, with the economy with which they mad commenced, and the energy with which the work would be carried out, it would lead to a very early completion of therailway. The proposed line would be abotit 110 miles in length - it woul&run from the Port of Kurrachee to a part of a noble river navigated by steamers at Hydeaba, oenin upa cuntr hainga population of abouta 30,000,000.There was 8nomdroyubht thatat the end of 10 years the railway would be estended beyond the 110 miles, and before the end of 15 years a line of railway would he completed from Kurrachee to the Punjaub. Tfhere could be no doubt that the means taken to improve the harbour of Kurrachee would make it more accessible for ships and steamers than Calcutta. In reply to questions, it was stated that it would be constructedas a smgle line in the first instance. hMr. Garrow, the engineer, stated that the line could be opened in three years from the'present time. The details for the whole of the railways in India had been agreed to by hMr. Stephenson, Mr. Pendel, and himself, as to gauge, rolling stock, and so forth. Sir H. MAnnocs, in reply to a question, stated that coal of an excelent quality for making coke had been discovered in some mines in India, with which he was connected, and consequently a great'saving to the railway companies would be effected under that head. At present the cokie had to bo sent from England. The Bengal coke could be sent by country vessels to various parts at a moderate cost. Tho colienes aJluded to were near the Rnnegange coalfield. Resolutions were passed, adopting the report, re-electin' hMr. Andrew and Mr. Williams, the retiring directors, and fixing the number of the directors for the present at fivethree to be a quorum. Sir H. MDDOCK remarked that Mr. Andrew had origin. ally projected the lne from Calcutta to Rajmahal, thence toAlllahabad by .steamers, and from the latter placo to Delhi by railw-ay. HIe had net been treated fairly by tho authoritkvs in respect to the Upper India Railway, and sup. p.ised they had granted him the Scinde Railway as acompensation for his services. Mr. A.. Mackenzie and Mr. H. Borradaile were elected auditors. The proccedings concluded with cordial votes of thanks to the chairman and directors for their services. TRAFC RETURNS.

- r2'Y CORN TrADE. UARK-LANE, MoNODAY Amnmox. FEB. 18. * With large arrivals of foreign wheat and four last week the general supplies were moderate. kxports, 350 quarters of wheat, and 79 quarters of oats. The home supply of wheat was 5,167 quartesS, the foreign 25,147. Of this there wero about 8,000 quarters from New York, and 10,000 from India. The morning'6 show from Essex and Kent wasmoderate, with the condition of Dany samples improved. Though ales were not readily made at the Kentish stands, those of Essex found a fair business at Is. to 2s. advance. In foreign, however, there was no improvement. The quuntity of coxnts_ flour ws 12,120 sclks. The foreign was 250 sacks, with 25,179 barrels from the United States. Norfolks were firn, being generally held at 51s. American, not being pressed, retained its value. Towvi quotations unchanged. Of barley there were 3,599 English, and a moderate addi. tion of samples for the morning. The former rates were more readily obtained, and ls. advance wa, occasionally made. In malt there was no change. The supply of oats was short-viz., only l,61l3 in all,. 5,240 being from Ireland, and 4,265 from Harlingen. There was some improvement in this trade, but it was limited to t'he low qualities of Irish, which sold at 6d. per quarter more money. The quantity of beans was moderate-viz., 456 quarters foreign, with 707 English. Peas were short, anounting to only 467 quarters English. Bothtthese descriptions of pulse weremore firmly held, and qualities fit for seed were held at higher rates. The arrival of linseed from India was considerable-viz., 12,619 ; exports, 110 quarters. The reducedprices of spr corn have lessened the demand for feeding pur oses, and rates were 2s. lower.

This cas stood over from the 11th inst., anda s in the pper this morning as part hea d; the reply, however, as not called for, as their Lordships affirmed the decree of' Vice-Chancellor Stuart in all unportant particulars, and directed the appellants' to pay the costs. Lord Justice Turner gave a long and very elaborate judgment, Lord Justice Hmgbt Brace only re5sarking that he agreed, and had only to iadd he observed with smprise and regret the lmo1t0 incredible line of conduct pursued by one of the defendants, and not by him alsne.' e f e d 'Mr. Malins and Ma; 1EL Stevens upported the decree of' theViee-Chancellor; Mr. Craig and Vr.G. S. Low were for the appeal. EOBTnSOS V. ITCHD. The argments in ti appeal, from- a decision of the baster of the Rolls, were commenced on Saturday, aid the facts were in part set out in Th' iemaes of Mondy. Theo plaintiff alleged, among other things, that he engloybd; Messrs. Kiteln and Grugeon "as. his brokers in the buying and selling of shares and bonds. in British, colonia, iand foreign rail1way and mining comrpines, and of stocks of foreign countries," from which they. received large sms, and retained for commission, continuation, and brokerage, large sums on his account; that they actod ,I as jobers as well as brokers," and in maqy instances when he gave.themn orders to buy theywere sellers, and acted as principals,.though professing to act as brokers,; and only entered into barzgams through their own books; snd that they also sometimes nominally and fictitiously usedthe namesof other Parties, "in order to dereive and cheat the laintiff" >and&had defrauded him of large sums of money, sides ci.arginghimwithcontinuationandchargegi everysettlingd-ay, which occurred onceafortnight; thatthey sometimes iadvised him to close certain transactions, whaich be did, and theythen continued them on their own account, nmaking thereby large profit to themselves and in other in stances advised him to keep them open, which he did, and they continued the same on their own account, charging him on settling-days with large sums of money, and apprpriating to themselves the- gain ona fal or rise in the market; and that by such means they had defrauded t,he plaintiff of very large sms of money. The bill, among other things, required the defendants to set forth the names and addresses and descriptions -of the persons from whom they purchased the sbres, bonds, and foreign stocks, and the tunes wvhen and prices at which and the persons to whom the same were sold and disposed of, or the names of the persons; whose n=ames they nominailly or-fictitiously used in en; such transactions, andto distinguish in their eccounts the several instancesi in which they wrere jobbers or principals. The bill also required the proiuctionof their books, and prayed accounts. Such and such like were the questions and the accounts in relation to which questions were put and asked, which the defendants declined to answer and produce, but which the Master of the RoUs declared mnust be answered and produced. Although the point does not arise upon the answer, yet it is essentiallythe same as if it, did, for the same questions were put in a rird rtoLcc examination of the defendants on their affidavits filed on a motion for the production of documents. Mir. Fo?rrT and Mr. MATNaDALE argued the case for the appellant. th.e OUNDEL PA3aR and Mr. W. RUnDAL were-for the plaintiff in support of the decree of the Court below, and stated that the loss the rev. plaintiff had sustained was no less thanl5,COOI by the conduct pursued by the defendants; and, in answer to a question from the bench, added that that loss was not attributable to a mere run of il luck, but to something else. Mr. FOLES ' was heardinreply.- Lord Justice KNiGiiT BRUCE said that the suitbefore the Court was instituted bra person describing himself as David Robertson, of slo. 4, Rutland-gate, Hyde Park, clerk, for an account of certain dealings and transactions of I a stockjobbing description, and by which that gentleman alleged he had been, to his regret, a loser, in which he had been engaged with the defendants, who were stockbrokers or stocLjobbers, or both. The transactions were not vwithin the Stockj6bbing Act, 7th George IL, c. 8. and therefore not strictly stockjobbing, although his Lordshipadvisedlyused that term. The cAse turned upon another statute, which regulated the sworn brokers of the city of London, and which rendered the defendants liable, as they said, to certain penalties if they were called upon to anlswer the questions put to them in the bill; and the question was whether the plaintiff was not entitled to th at rule of a court of equity that as principal he was entitled to the accounts of those who had acted as his agents, and his Lordship was bound to say tbat, notwithstandig the laical nature of his transactions writh the defendants, he was so entitled; and, although the rev. plaintiffin the face of societyl avowed himself apartacipafor in such matters as the bill disclosed, and wising that he (the Lord Justice) could refuse him his cost, he feared he must let him have them, and agree in dismising the appeal with costs. He heartily trusted, howver, that the Court might hear no more of this cause, or of any such. Hlis Lordship~gave a preference to the law as laid down by Sir Anthony Hart inthe case of "Green v. WVeaver" in 1 Simons's Reports, 404, decided so lone' ago as it had been. Lord Jusctice TrIMLtEB quite areed tbat the appeal must he dismissed with costs.| SAUNDERlS V. DEUICE.!

ROIIS' COURT, Cn scERmY-LAN- FEB.18. WORTHINGTON V. CANN. tBefove Mhe IR of MPue RaT.TRI 1The MASTER o0 the IOLLS gavo jUdgMent in this suit, the object of vwhideh wato set aside the lease of a house in Abchurch-lane, on the ground that the terms of the lease were unfavourable toward the lady beneficially interested in the property, and}hadbeen agreed to by her trsees without her sauctionandagainst her wishes. It appeared that the plaintiff Mrs. Worthington, was separated from her husband, and that in the year 1840 a deed was executed by which the house in question was assiged to trustees for her benefit, powers being reserved to the trustees to sell or let tie same vith her permission. At the timna of the execmtion of the deed the house was let on a lease, which expired in 1850, when a Mr. leslie made an offer for a new lease of the house at a yearly rent of 1101. This offer the trustees aceepted, notwithstanding Mr Worthington protested against their doing so, and had given notice to Mr. Ieslie that she would not consent to his having a lease granted to him on the terms proposed, inasmuch as the rent offered was too low, and she could get more by letting out the house in separate sets of offices. The Court, after hearing the evideace on both sides, was of opinion that more might have been obtained for the house than Mr. Leslie had agreed toVgive; that the trustees had no right to grant a lease' of it in the face oE their estuiq7ue trs' exspressed wishes; that such lease should be set aside; and that Mrs. Worthington had a right to claim the ssistance of the Court of Chancery to protect the integrity of her interest under the deed of 1840.

The facts of the case hafing been stated in 2'7 Times of this day (Monday) it will not"bo necessaryto do more now than to refer to them briefy By the Norfolk1 Estuary Amendmant Act (1849) the Rau Brink Commissioners were required to contribute the sum of 60,0001., which wms to be paid in certain instalments, towards the execution of the works thereby authorized to be constructed " by and out of the tolls vested in or payable " to them, "and which tolls ar thereby charged with the payment thereof, and by such sale or mortgage of the lands and property of the commissioners as thereinafter mentioned.'

Bacon and MIr. Busk for the commuissioners. The VIc-Crsmecxauou said that he thought that the act of 1849 gave the plaintiffs a charge on the lands soldby the commissioners, and that the latter had not established a case which entitled them to applythe proceeds of the sale of those lands to theprejudice oD the plaintiff's claim. There would therefore bean injunction in the terms of the notice of motion. SITGDE1C V. CROSLANwD. -- This was a suit for the administration of the estate of the late William Sugden, of Leeds;'and the bill also sought to have it declared that a sum of money which had been paid to one Jarvis Horsaeld, a trustee appointed by the testator as a consideration for his retirinz from his trust, should be repaid by him and applied for the benefit of the certu V IQe trnstsentitleclunder the testator's wilL .The testator,'by hiswill, made in March, 1852, appointed the defendant Crosland one of the trustees and erecutors of hiswill, which contained a power of appointing new 'trustees. By a codicil made in the.j ensuing Isovamber the testator revoked the appointment of Croslhud *s-oneOf his trustees and executors, and appointed Jervis Morsfield in his stead. The testatordied in 1853, and subsequently to his decease Crosland was appointed a trustee and executor of the testator in tse place of Horsfield. After that am poittment it came to theplaintiffs knowledge thatHforaield, had received from Crosland the sum of 751. as a consideration for his retiring from the trusteeship of. thetestator's Will and codicil in favour of Crosland. It was statedthatthe I sum of 75!. formed no part of the testator's assets, but that I it had been paid by Croslind out of his ownupocket. L - M r. Mains and mr.

SUTCIjFr.- The chief question' in this cse was whether trustea shouldbe ordered to pavythe costs of the suit which it was aUleged had been rendered necessary by their refusal to ex. ecute a conveyaice without the snction of the Court, tbera being no sufficient grounds for such refusaL The rouncds put forward by the trustees were rested on the validity of an appointment made by a father in favour of two of his children, and which the. ustees considered was so tainted( with fraud, by reason~ of a benefit baving accrued tothe fatherbimnself by the transaction, that they declined to re. cognize it as a valid appointment, except under the in-. deinnity of the Court. The short facts of the case asgatber{Sd from the evidence vrere that the father wvas entitled to cer-. tain property for his life, with remainder to his children ac he should appoint; that, upon histwo elder sons coming oi: age, and wishing to be started in life, their father, at ther urgent request, agreed to enter into partnership with thei asc orudeaers, that the partnership being in want of capital to carry it on, itbecanie necessaryto raise money for tho purpose; that accordingly, on the 4th of February, 1852, an appointment ws executed by the father of a portion oC the pro ty over which he had a power, and of which the corn mil formed a part, in favour of the two sons ; ansi that on the day following a mortgage was created by il three partners for 800!., recited to be paid to them, aasl which was securedpartly on the property appointed to the sons and partly on the machinery of the mill itself, which belonged -to the father absolutely, and was of th Pe value of upwards of 600L Onthe deathof thefather, ia September, 1852, leaving seven children, further advamces were made to thetwo sons, and the legal estate in tF'e property chargea being in the trustees they were appliedw'' tor a conveyance, - which they refused to execute, ex-cept; under the order of the Court As far as possible to remove any objection as to the appointment having been fraudulent, two out of the other five children executed a deed confirm.. ing it, the renining three children being intata - but, the fsal till being insisted on, the suit was instituted. Mr. ROLT and Mr. Caus, for the plaintiffs, urged upons the Court that the whole costs of the suit ought to be paici by the trustees, and more especially because, in addition to the objection being utterly untenable, they had thought fit to encumber the case with evidence which had nothing whatever to do with the case, referring to the state of the family for many years past, and to some alleged early em. barrassments on the part of the father. lr. Pn xuiuRGAaST, for the tiusSees, contended that they had no personal interest in the matter, and had acted entirely from a sense of duty. They had taken the opinion of an eminent conveyancing counsel as to the question whether the mortgage deed, coming so soon after the appointmient, wasuot, en the very broad principles of courts of eqity which applied to these transactions, quite sufficient to rI a suspicion that the appointment was tainted with some benefitto the father, andtherefore invalid. With respect to the evidence, the issne of credit and responsibility hadl been directly raised by the bill, and the defendants iuterr gated on the pomt. The VIca~-CZ CEIAxCzriOa, advertingtothe facts of the case,' said that there could be no doubt as to the bona isIa of the3ppointment, and that there had been no bargain or stipislation with the father whose own property formed part of thesecurity for the debt, and who hims"eli bad a life interest int the property appointed. All fraud 'was most positively negatived by the eidence. It might havo been better i the mortgage deedhbad-been framed soas to show that:the money berrowed formed the share of the son's capital in the business, d to have had it so carried into the books of the. partnership With respect to the conduct of the trsteeshis Honour said that they did not appear to have taken any trouble in the matter by making inquiries about thetransaction, and thus obtaining the same information as was now presented to the Court, which they might have done; and, disapproving, as he did, the manner in which they had conducted the case, he should certainy not allowrthem the costs of this discussion. They would have their costs, charges, and expenses properly incurred in the trust, but not in the suit.

Lord CA3VBEIL said the question was oLe entirely for the jury to decide upon the evidence and the urobabilties o the case. His Lordship, however, thought that the. view - given of the circumstances hy the barboursnaster, who was an unprejudiced witness, would probably be considered the correct one, and adopted by the jury. That evidence wag entirely in favour of the plaintiff. The jury found their verdict for the plaintiff for 53. the agreed amount of the damnage.
INSOLVE.NT DEBTOS' COURT, Fc. 1& IN RE A3RAIEXA5 RODRIGUEZ BRANDON. I (Beforo Mr-. dominisutioer P=.nrT .1 le insolvent, awiolesale rc4ot and shoedeaier in oundsditch, was oppaed by Mr. Nichols, and wvas supported by Mfr. Sargood. epre f t The insolvent had exotdlarge quantities ofgoods t Australia, consigned to his son, Moses Brandon, who vvas entered on the schedule as a debtor to the extent of 2,8O~ on account of such consignments. In April last he calm! his creditors together, and, stating that the depressed state of the Australian markets had interfered toliminish the returns from his son, a letter of license was signed by tho creditors, the insolvent undertaking to pay overt two in.- spectors any smus he might receive from his son. It. ap- peared from the schedule that since that time remittancea: had been recedved from Moses Brandon to the extent ot upwards of 1,1001., of which the insolventpaidtohiscreditom only4001., and expended 7801. innew venturesto his son. the results of which were as. yet unlmowm. Another pointr raised in the case was whether Noses Brandon was not a- partner of the insolvent, whose business had been carriedf. on under the styl&of " Brandon and Son." Two witnesses were called, who swore that the insolvent had.distinctly told them thae his son Moses] was a partner. This statement, however, was strongly denied by the insolvent, who said the son who was his partner was Henry Brandon, aged13. The learned Comn&sioS33B said the evidence upon the question of the partnership was strong enough to raise X suspicon, although perhaps not sufficient to convey convicfion. One suspicious circumstance was that the inscl. vent, out of the multitude of letters which he must havoc received from his son Moses, only produced one, and ever in that one, selected, no doubt, with care, the son spoke ot the personsintefested.in the property as "we"-an espression which could only imply that he was jointly interested with his father in the speculation of which he-was writing. However, upon that poit it was impossible to decide with certainty; but it was clear that the inslvent had not deat with big re litt iirly. lifter obtaining from them am indulgence, upon condition of Tdndihg overre-itemnll moneys which he might receive,t onchose, instead of doirg so,dto invest a large sum in a renewal of the speculationsb which had aready been sO unfortunate as to compel him ta call his creditors together.

FA bNicliolas awas to be lAown up at 1 p.mi. The 'FrenYch enguieers were puncttual to tireir time. -Mirshal Pelissier had been little more than a qnnrter of an hour chatting and pacing about on a b.ti4ik he had selected for his station, and General Codrington could have been buta few nminutes in the ; 1 Redan, when a double burst of snmeke fixed every- body's eyes upon the fort. This is (I should now say, was) of a curved shape, forming nearly a quarter of a circle, one extremity-of the arc pointiing south and tle other east. The two extremities 'vere first biown up, and the principal explosion 'seemed to be that of the easter end, whlich vwas in the form of a round tower. The effect of the rising smoke was very striking and peculiar. The day was - extremely fine, the sky nerlyy cloudless; the vhite *masonry of Sebastopol, beutiful even in those ruinhs *with which the well-preervedl but doomed fort con- spicuouly contrasted, lay silent and seemingly .abandoned in the embrace of the bright green sea. Suddenly, forth gushed the smoke, not rapidly, but in heavy billows, rising and rolling one above the other as if the vapour were so dense that it had a strtuggle to nscend. Slowvly it rose; .o slowly that it was easy to imagine fantastical forms, melting aw-ay but gradually. Immediately over the eastern explosion there hung for some seconds what seemed a mighty gray lion, witl head, mane, and body perfectly defined in shadonwy delineation. Otlhers besides myself recognized the fanciful image, acceptable as the emblem of dissolving Russian strength, and presently replaced by other vague shapes. Upwardsof 20 seconds elapsedbeforethe explosions wereaudible in front of Picket-househill. There was so little wind that the smoke rose to a considerable heiglht before it began to drift ofl in a south-westerly direction, and it rose, not - in colunus, buit rather in heaps or domes such *as a-re sometimes seen in the sky when clouds are piled oneach other. The lower part of these heapq of vapoiTr joinetl, and the scattered summits dispersed and mingled before the liglht north-easterly current, sooner than the centres blended, and sc there rezained a sort of loophole in the smoke, through which was seen a patch of the emerald wates glittering in the brilliant sunbeams. The effect, ol Course very transient, wvas extremely beautiful. The whole nuss of smoke then began to clear oft, anc the spectators impatiently awaited the momeni when the windward extremity of the fort should be diixcosed to their gaze. A sort of low gray spit w&n presently seen, but was almost immediately agair averclouded by other explosions whiclh now- rapidl3 succeeded each other. There were seven in all, now of themi muchl loudler than the report of avery heavy piece of ordnance. When the explosions in the docka took place, on various occasions nithin the last twc months, there was always great alarn, commnotion, and plunging among the horses tethered in the reaA of the dockyard wall, and, notwithstanding the great difference of distance, something of the kind v anticipated among the nunmerous chargers and ponies assembled this morning on the hill in ream of our old trenches. Few of them, however, appeared to notice the explosions, and those showed but slight uneasiness. 'When aU the miines had been fired and the smoke cleared off, we saw how completely the French engineers had done their work. The long, mazsive, stonc fort-certainly the mosl prominent object in a bird's-eye view of Southerr Sebastopol-had totally disappeared, and in its plac( was a low fiat bank of gray ruins, as nearly as migh' be of the same colour as the smok-e that had jusi been blown away from it, and of which some linger ing remains still oozed and curled out from the rub bisL. So important a feature was this fort, that itn removil has made quite achangeinthe physiognomy iof the town. Before the explosion the Russian had been firing from the north batteries-nol heavily, perhaps at the rate of a shot per minute and we fully expected that, on witnessing the destruction of one of their finest forts, they wouk open an angry fire, as they have done on man) former occasions, in hopes of damnaging the troop and engineers theysupr,posed to be in the town. Buf they did not do so, and fired less after than before the explosion. One shell burst high over the 3lalakhoi, andanother-from the battery east of Fori Constantine over the town, and one or two of the Inkermann batteriesgent a shot or two in the direc. ftion of our lines, but that was nearly all, and, aftem 'waiting a uhfle in hopes that they were mute only fromastonishment and would presently make up fol the delay, most-of the spectators, whose feet were by this time getting benumbed in their stirrups, tuned iheir horses' heads homewards. I have not yet ascertained with .oenainty the quantity of powdex usedto bIow up thefqrt,but, judging from the extent dcl eat solidity .of the bnilding, and from the >owpleteness of the dectruction, it must have been rery large. I was t-old to-daydthat it exceeded the quautity destroyed in the unfortunate explosion oi t 'be French left siege trai. The destruction of the , 'etern and last remaining dock wascompleted last WEVek, without noteworthy incident. _tgreat deal of the xrnin has been effeeted witL the Zussim' own powder captured in SebastopoL The explosion I have described is the only incident of importance that has broken the mono'ony of camp life since I last wrote. A shocking xiaurder was committed last week in one of the Light Division hospitals by a soldier of the 7 th Regiment, a yo uth ,of 19, named Day. He was hospital orderly, vi'd *-as in attendance upon an artilleryman who ha. aIgn badly hurt when the French siege train blewlpu, The artilleryman, grateful for his care, took a .pu , containing about 121., from under his pillow, and2gtre him 5s. The sight of the gold was too xtro,igg teraptation for Day, who, it is said, was a Ioudoe,l3ief before enlirtment. He took a crowbar and de;I ,a violent blow upon the artilleryman's bead The For fellow sriekaed "Murder !" when a second bloW fractured his am. His cries brought in the oi.er orderlies, and, after a most violent resistance, Day was overpowered and scured. The artilleryman is since glead. The money-order offices at Balaklava and Headquarters have now- been a w8ek open, and the use Pe, bM Aitlrto been made of 1JherR more than judtifies the most sanguine anticipations of those who predietaed bat they would be accepted by tbe anmy a5 % b^ and great convenience. On Monday, U a-quartcrs' post-office, orders were given to tAe pmolunt of 1701.; on Friday to that of 301. (,n Wednesday, at BalakLava, 3001. of orders vv,ro istsed, and on Saturday 5001. Thlis {ivya a, tOXtI of 1,2701. sent homno in onie week by the army in the Crimea, in stums varying frow. 11. to 51. There were fowr cases where the 5aWme man sent home more than 511 (by taking twvo or more orders), and a few others where siums of less than 11. were sent. It wro take 21. 10s. as the average amount of We orders, we find; that iipwards of 500 men %.ave availed tlhtteAelves of this cheap and ready means of reitffting money to their families. There can IWmdly be a dotibt that a very large portion'd the money thus sent is reseacd from the eantien men and other sharks, who lprey ulpoi the -sier, and into whose hands it wotuld otherwise fIL The army is much indlebted to the Post-office s.uthorities in Constantinople and in London-by whom, as I hear, the plan wvs simultaneously suggested-for extending to it the benefits of an insti- tition the introdulction of wlhiehl of couirse gives | good deal of additional trouble to post-office cmtp70yes in the East, but -which] will tend to diminish dnnkenness and to improvo the character of tlle soldier-to say nothing of the comfort it will be to nany a poor family in England having father, husband, or brother serving in the Crimea. The senders of the money are from all branicles of the service, including the men in the Army Vorks Corps, aniog whonm, as we have had abundant opporttnities of seeing upon thle roads and in the neighbouirhood of their cunip, there has hitlherto been a good deal of drunkenness, owing in part, no doubt, to the very h igh wages they receive. It would perhaps save trouible, prevenit crowding at the post-office, and prove an accommodation to soldiers, whom duty inay prevent from getting to Head-quarters or Balakiava during the hoturs of isstte, if a sergeant of each regiment wvere to take the miioney from the men. the list of names and necessary particulars, and procure tho orders. But doubtless the commanding officers of corps will make sueh arrangements of this kind as are most fitting and convenient, and best calculated to indulce soldiers to remit money to England instead of squandering it in the Crhnea.

THEi BRITISH HOSPITAL AT RENKIOI. (FRO3E OUI OWN CORUEsrONDENT.) ElKrIUOI, JAN. 31 hIore sick-but upon this occasion the cases were again of mild ch.aacter, with the exception of about 312, which will requre great care and attention. I feel assutred that the authorities at home would feel pleased at witncesing thc comforts provided for the patients during the sea pasage. The stcamcrs are of the finest build, being taken either from Cunard's aNorthl American iine or fronm the lVest India service, .nd they are fitted up as floating hospitals, replete wvith comfort. On the 28th a large vessel was seen steering direct for the iiouthl pier throug,h a heavy mist of rain; sheo p roved to bo the Alps,I wvith 120 invalids from Balaiklava, a nd orders were given for immediate preparation for their disembarcation. The medical officers went to their respective posts, strong fatigue parties of soldiers were ordered out by Major Chads, the military officer in command, and a proper number of wards were put into tho usual state of comfort. At one end a large stove blazes cheerfiully; at the other, wrater, arrowroot, and other necessaries are kept hot and ready in Price's candle-stoves; lights are suspended at intervals along the walls, and a requisite runber of nursos and orderlies are seen busily occupied in airranging the fhuniture and bedding. Of the rapidity with which matters at e enlioi are COnIducted an idea may be formed when I state that the Alps dropped anchror offthe south pier at 3.30 p.m., the first boat left the ship's side, about half-a-mile from the shore, at 4, and every patient was in bed and under treatmcnt, having been dinted and prescribed for by the proper medical officer, by 5.20. It is above a quarter of a-mile from the south pier to the corridor. Rain fell heavily, the ground was soft and muddy, the ayhight was gone at wl anlld yet the men -oore deposited in thou' beds wvarm and dry, and without fatigue. The accomplishlment of this was duo to the railway, whlich now runs from the pier into the corridor, where a turntable receires it, ready in a fewv weeks to dhrect the carriages upon branch lines whichl will bring them to the very door3 of the wards. Instead of patients being carriel sinigly upon stretchers, between twvo men staggering over the rough wild country, with their worn-out and groaninlg blurden, 50 or 60 men are put upon trucks, covered up with blankets, and ga.lloped ,ntii the hospital along the smooth tramway in a few minutes. Never *.as a more successful work iundertaken, and it will remain a matter of history that the first railway ever laid down in Asia Minor was on thc plain of the Blenkioi Hospital, and used as a transport for sick and w ounded soldiers dluring thle camlpaign in the Crimea. I mentioned in a former letter that for some time the medical staff has been pretty well occupied, many of the cases having been very severe, especially those among the Laud Transport Corps. It is not possible to say positively howv the last arrival by the Alps may turn out, but I believe the greater number will do well; nevertheless, there is even among them a proportion of fever cases. The accompanying lst of deaths for the week will enable your readers to form their on judg,ment as to the efficiency of this hospital, particularly when it is borne in niiuld that since October there have beeni between 1,100 and 1,200 admissions, a mortality of not 1 per cent., and only three eases of readmission for relapse. There has been no epidemic, no spreading of disease from bed to bed, no case of indigenous disease. The life here is undoubtedly rough ;alarg,e proportion of the common comforts of polished life must be surrendered, and the name of luxury must be forgotten, but I think it wvill be conceded that the objects for which this establishment was founded have been attained, .aid that the gentlemen appointed have been faithfuli to their trust. It isacomunonrerarkthat the first four lines of the letterfromnRenk-ioi in Die Times resembles LordRaglan's despatches in its details abouit the weather. The observation is ,ust, but correct information as to tlle nature of the climate here was too important to be omitted. For the last week it has been very fine, tne thermometer has varied between 50 deg. to 60 deg. Fahrenheit-55 derr. being what in England we term. temperate. WVe gave before us some weeks of heavy rain, but the cold is passed. It may be said, therefore, that to an Englishman's idea we had no winter, althouglh to the shuddering native the occasional two dayes frost seemed its sternest realization. We are told that we have passed through an average winter, and this statement seems borne out by the nature of the houses, the dress of the inhabitants, the aspect of the coumtry, and the character of the vegetation. It is desirable that rain should fall, because of the water-supply. At the present moment there is more than the reservoir will hold, but the daily consumption is enormous-Mr. Brunton estimates the amount now used at 30 gallons a-head ! six to 10 gallons is a liberal allowance to each man, but it is thought undesirable, now that it is unnecessary, to check this growing taste for cold water. Two more springs-perhaps three-will be added to the general supply next summer, so that there will ba ample for the wants of the hospital, even when developed to its fulll extent.- On the 28th 6i2patients and two officers were sent home invalided by the Saldanha transport. The latter was an officer of the Bashi-Bazouks, now convalescent from a most severe attack of dysentery, and one of the assistant-surgeons of the Renkioi Hoital, M3r. Roberts, whose health had seemed to fail Lim ever since he quitted England; and here I may remark that many persons, both men and women, have applied for posts in the hospitals of the E3ast, labouring under a most erroneous impression that a residence in this part of the world would impart to them a strength to perform duties for which in a colder climate they found themselves unequaL Here most of the advantages of a warm country are to be obtained, it is true, but then there are the- discomforts of an early settlement among an uncultivated people, while the proper discharge of hospital dluties, which must be gone through with equal regularity whether the thermometer stands at 25' F., or above 900, makes a considerable demand upon the personal strength. No one should volunteer to any such office unless -with an uninjured and strong constitution. The delicate are upon all occasions the first to suffer. The following is a list of deaths in the general hospital at Renlioi, from the 28th of January to the 2d of February:- Piivate PBichard navel, gelatio, diarrhnea; Private Stephen Balls, fever- Private Epbraim - Brown, paeunonia;and Private JesepimWinterbottom, dysentery.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Evenatatimonwhenthe "puroandsimnple"acooptaneo of the Ultimalissims Five Points is securing for Europe an honourablo ard permanent pece, there are individuals inquisitive enough to ask, "What is becomo of the Five Pointsof Asia ?" A highly commendablo politenessprevents our politicians from obtruding such tlemeo upon a people courteous, yot suseoptiblewithal, like ourfricnds thoereneh. But, Sir, although wo naturaUy blush to own it, there is a placo called India which England conquered in tho somi-barbarous ages that preceded railways and peace-policy, electric telegraphs, and "sham wars;"there is moreover, an out-of-the-way nook named Persia, where some miUions of a coin termed rupeos have been spent for other purposes than the general diffusion of British bnlion ; and, sad contrast to the amenities of diplomacy I certain honest, but deluded, persons, somewhat aLfter the fashion of " the Duke," cannot discover tho policy of not hitting one's enemy as hard as one can, and in the most vulnerable place. They loudly declare that they have lavished blood and treasure, not simplyto prop uip the totter- ing old Porte, tosmash the Twelve Apostles, and to dismantle th souithern suburb of Sobastopol, but with the end and aim of crippling boon Jilc tho resources of Russia, and thus of rendering active aggression on her part in Asia as wecl as in Europe, for soine years at least, impossible. The nentralization of the Caspian Sea, still a Russian lake, is deemed wvorthy of consideration by these unpolitical people, wlo have been suspected of discussing en ptite contit.i the subsidizing of Schamyl, the exclusion of Muscovite influenec from Kurdistan, the re-establishment of Britishl prstiUge in Persia, the salvation of Kliiva, and tho curious, though scareely the delicate, question,-W'Wat are the frontiers of Russia in Central Asia ?-The Araxes ? Or the Persian Gulf? Or the River Indus? E.arly in the present century tw-o grcat military routesaccording to Sir J. ifPDonald, conmected Russia with Nortliern India. The line of least resistance, if we may trust Eldred Pottinger, lay tlrough Mfushed, Herat, Cabul, andCandahar, to Peshaw ur. The other, passing by Bokhara, Bah, and the Hindoo Kusli, was deemed impracticable until General Harla's Paropanisan march with artilery in 1838. This subject engrossed the attention of Stirling, ConoDy, Bnrnes and Abbott, 'Mouravieff, Orloff, Zinnmermawn, and a host of others. Captain Grover complained that the British public believed Bokhara to be in Persia. But in 1836 Mr. MINeill went to Teheran as Minister, and M1r. David Urqnhlart became Secretary of Embassy at Constantinople, while Mr. B. Fraser remained as Oriental Reporter in Downing-street. The Eastern question was written up, skirmishers were thrown out in the daily papers, the monthlies swept the field in serried files, cavalry and artiolery succeeded inI pamphlets and reports, tle heavy quarterlies acted as support, andahuge portfolio tlc rserve; the Guards' charge was the " Progress and Present Position of Russia in the East." 1Nei1, Chesney, and their followers proved the northern apophthcgm-"The road to the English lies tlhroughl Persia." They showed that an invasion of India was not only possible but probable. To the frigid apathy of 1828 succeeded tho fever fit of 1838, and relapses of Russophobia throutgh the five subsequent years. Presently the question of Indian invasion vi4 Persia. chameleon-likke, changed its colour. In 1839 Perofsky advanced upon Ehiva, "to strengthen in that part of Asia," said his master's manifesto, "the Lawful influence to which Russia has a right." Honneur oblige] At the sametimc, England prepared to push a spider's web beyond the Hindoo ulish, for the purpose of entanglng Dost Mahommed. It i printed tlat Baron Brunow then remarked to Sir J. Robhouse,-" If we go on at this rate, Sir John, the Cossack and the Sepoy wiU soon meet upon the banks of the Oxus ;" and that the President replied with aspirit. "Ve-ryprob.bly. Baron, bit, however mich I should regret the coUision, I should have no fear of the result In this year of grace, 15G, the Proteus once more alters shape. The sun of Circassia, Persia, Kurdistan, Ehiva, and Affghanistan has sunk below tle political horizon in England. Russia has pushed on her lines tirough the dark. The first parallel, the Caucasas, is, and is to be, purely Russian. The second, Persia (aUowed in Nasirel din Shah's day peacefully to occupy the }erat for which Mahomed Shah was all but invaded), is also exclusively Russian. The third, Affghauistan, remains, but thc head of the Russian sap, diplomacy, is firmly planted in the land. Sir, the honest individuals to whom I referred labour under another strange hallucination. They assert that active and efficient measures might have broken up these paraUlels, and crushed Trans-Caucasian Russia even in the ast campaign. I will briefly glance at their delusion. They say that early in 1855 Schlamyl sent his Naib, or managing man, to Constantinople for the purpose of securing what all such people want-a subsidy; that the Naib returned to the Caucasus in disgust; that Schamyl, abandoned by the Porte and Great Britain, shook hands with his old enemy, and that when 0 mar Pasha advaned upon Georgia the Daghestani tlhreatened to fall upon the Turkish rear. Diplomatists will readily discern that Schamyl, a brigand, who flogged his mother, put to death Russian prisoners, and beheves himself an inlcarnation of the Deity, could not, in an age of perfect respectability, be recognized publiecly as the ally of a highly moral nation. On the other haud, people not versed in these humanities assert that the Revue desDcuxMondes has thrown doubt upon the " Prophet's" il conduct; that at any rato an agent or agents, recognized by Government, might have been sent to inspect and report upon the possibility of a "Pancaucasian Empire ;" and, lastly, that the history of alliances contains some holy, but many unholy, ones contracted with potentates whose private character was none of tho prettiest, who have not been averse froma little murderand hypocniV, and, in fact,,whose principal merit was the being en grand what Schamyl is said to be en petit. The principle of non-intervention-so truly worthy of a great nation-as laid down for Central Asia by Sir G. Barlow, has been duly carried out in Kardistan3 The Porte cannot levy soldiers in the country of the Spahis, once the flower of Eastern cavalry; but the Russians have officered Kurdish regiments, and their spies have diffused discontent through the land. The diplomatist knows that these Kurds -a scurvy set of saintless fellows who live by violence and rapine-are not to be encouraged; that the cause of Turkey is well-nigh hopeless around lake Van, and that one I "daurna name" has threatened to -.thdraw the light of his countenance from Britannia should she attempt " establishments"in Central Asia. On the other hand, the clique, never without a dernier mot, declares that among the records of the Foreign-office lies an excellent plan by General (now Sir W.) Williams for energetic action in Kurdistan; that officers of note have volunteered for service in a Kurdish Contingent; and that, had Kars been provisioned and Omar Pasha enabled to reach Kutais, in another month a column of mountaineers might have been marching upon Tiflis. It is not to be expeeted that the head of either party -initiated, or uninitiated-should know aught beyond generalizin" concerning such corners as Georgia, Abasia, Imeritia, Mngrelia, &e. Yet, sad to relate! they are not greed upon the course to be parsued there. Politicians assert that those provinces dechned undertheis own princes, feoffees of Turkey and Persia, and flourished under Russian dominion; they could notresubject Christians to,the Moslem; they respect the Czar's avital unwillingness to yield territory-no matter how won --and they insinuate that the exalted personag,e to whomu I tremblingly alluded hesitates, in the plenitade of his traditional kingeraft, to makte the P-orte too powerful. The tmpolite cavillers at these decorous doctrines retort, withsome stale proverb concerning the fiat of justice, and would even rather fight single-handed than swim paceably with the streant when it sets the irong ff Abasia and its vicinity be ten--e Tncognift, Ehiva and Affghanistan labour under the imputation of being subjects exclusively Indian, fit themes to narcotiza the House of Commons, and for the "own correspondenaVs column of a Gr=at Courier or a .unjab im. No ftress, however, is laid npon English supineness in those Eurasian lands, even by the loudest of the clamourers. But theyare not slow to blame India, which might have taken a more patriotic part in the present struggle, and might easily have excluded Russian influence from Persia--and the contmnonsregions. Having made by study and observation some acuaintance with those countries, and being convinced that tbe subiect no so neglected will again become momnentous, I shall be tempted to devote a second letter to the present tat3e of Pesn", and suggest a remedy for the littledtisordernow afllet~sg ie.
