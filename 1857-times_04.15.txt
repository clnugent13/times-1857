The quotation of gold at Paris -s, aout 6'Per mille premium, and the short exchange on London is 25.25 per 11. sterling. -On comparing these rates with the English Mint price of at. 17s.- 10id. per ounce for standard gold, it appears that gold is nearly 3-lOths per cent; dearer in Paris than in London.
By advices from Hamburg the price of gold is 424 por mark,. and the short exchange on London is I .4 per 11. sterling. Standard gold at the English I Mint price is therefore about 2-10ths per cent.
dearer in Eamburg than in London.
The course of exchange at New York on London for bills at 60 days' sight is lOe per cent., which, when compared with the Mint par bebween the two countries, showsthat the exchange is against EBg-' land; buts after making-allowance for charges of transport and difference of interest, the present rate leaves no profit on the transmission of gold either way between England and America.
The English funds opened. steadily this morning, but the market almost immediately became langaid, and continued without any tendency to revival thrQughout the day. The first quotation of Consol
for money was 92i to 93, whence'they soon declined to 92k, the final transactions being at 921 to J for' money and 934 to i for the 7th of May. Loans on Government securities were in request at 6i per cen't. There were several purchases of stock in the morning on the part of the public, but the general disposition of the speculators was to effect sales.. Bank Stock left off at 214 to 216; Reduced, 91i to i; lNew Three per Cents., 911 to J India Stock, 222 to 223; Exchequer-bonds, 984 to i; India-bonds, 7s. to 4s. discount; and Exchequerbills (March), 2s. discount to Is. premium.
In the discount-market and at the Bank the demand for money was very active. Some large amounts of silver purchased about a fortnight back are to be paid for on the 16th aid the increased preesure is attributed partly to tius circumstance.
Foreign securities were steady, prices in some cases exhibiting increased firmness. Turkish Six per Cents, were negotiated at 94~ and j for money; and the Four per Cents. Guaranteed at 100k and i for the account. The other traactions comprised -Brazilian Five per Cents., 994; Chilian Three per Cents., 78; New Granada Active, 24; Guatemala, 55; Mexican, 23'; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 77i and 7 ; the Three per Cents., 54D and
; Portuguese Three per Cent3. 45; S an Five per Cents., 90. ; Spanish New Deferred, 2S; the Certificates, 64 and f ; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 97.
In the foreign exchangea this afternoon the transactions were not extensive, and the rates were considered about the same as last post.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse failed to arrive this even|ing, but transactions took place shortly after the opening at 70f. 16c. for the end of the month, showing no alteration.
A sum of 170,0001. out of the gold by the Royal Charter was sold to the Bank to-day, and a further large amount is expected to be taken there tomnorrow.
Nothing has transpired in London lately regarding the projected Turkish Bank, but advices from Constantinople give further details, which enable a clear view to be formed of the intentions of the Government regarding the entire scope of its operations. They confirm the impression first expressed, and, as they are not likely to be repealed or modified in favour of any other scheme, since it is said the native houses are ready to take up the concession in case it should be abandoned by the capitalists of London and Paris, the following amended r?sumg will prove useful :-The privileges are for 30 years, and extend over the whole of the Turkish dominions, giving the right of establishing branches in any part of the empire. The capital is to be 10,000,0001., of which 2,500,0001. must be paid up. The Board are to consist of a Governor, Deputy-Governor, and 24 directors, the Government nominating the Governor and Deputy-Governor and siX directors, the remaining 18 directors being elcted by the shareholders. The right of issue is for 15,000,0001., with a reserve of one-half in specie. Within six months from the conmmencement of business the Bank are to withdraw that portion of the existing.State paper circulation which bears interest. This amounts to about 2,700,0001., of which 1,600,0001. carries 6 per cent., and ,100,0001. 10 per cent. The circulationl not hearing interest-about 2,300,0001.-is to be redeemed within 15 months. The total to be redeemed is, therefore, 5,000,0001. The depreciated specie currency, amounting to 4,500,0001., is to be replaced by new silver and copper coinages to be gradually supplied from the M.int-the former with an alloy of 16 per cent., the latter with an alloy of 33 per cent. For the amount of paper currency withdrawn the Government are to give the Bank transferable Six per Cent. Treasury Bonds, secured by a special assignment of the revenues of the provinees of Eonia and Eutayah, Adrianople and RJsl uif, amounting to nearly 1,000,0001. per annum. Similar bonds are also to be given for any difference resulting between the value of the depreciated currency called in and the new coinages issued in its place. Finally, the Board are to have the power ol carrying on all legitimate banking operations in the same manner as the Banks of England and France, and it is to be assumed that the conduct of the general business of the Government at certain rates of commission is also contemplated as among their most important functions. The whole of these arrangements are creditable to the framers of them, especially as they are characterized by a certain degree of stringency which indicates that the Government consider that if Turkey is fit to enjoy a National Banlk she may properly insist upon dignified conditions which shalI mark her emancipation from the hands of those speculators who have hitherto traded upon a discredit, caused not by dishonesty, but mismanagement. It is alleged that such hesitation as has yet been manifested in London in takinog up the project is to be attribated to dissatisfaction that the Government have not offered more extensive means of gain, such as would be satisfactory to the concoctors of Banks of Cr6dit Mobilier, and also that they have retained a considerable amount of control in their own hands. The terms, however, supposing them to be faithfully upheld, are such as 'to admit of profits equal to anything that a rational investor could desire, and if more were granted they should operate rather to deter than to attract. Of course, the gains from the circulation would be greater if the specie reserve were fixed at one-third, instead of one-half, but at the beginning the precaution is a wise one, and it can be modified if experience shall show the safety of the lower amount. With regard to the redemption of the 5,000,0001. of paper circulation, it may be taken for granted that the void created by its withdrawal will be supplied by the notes of the new Bank, while there is also reason to believe that a farther large quantity of these notes will pass into currency in exchange for some portion of the enormous amount of English and French gold at present understood to be hoarded throughout the empire for want of some safe representative medium. In that case it might be possible for the whole process of the redemption of the currency to
be carried out without the necessity of a single ounce of bullion being permanently drawn from England or any other country. It is asserted, moreover, that there is a prospect of the -Six per Cent. Treasury Bonds held by the Bank being always negotiable at a premium in case of need. At present the interest bearing portion of the paper circulation is said to command a premium of 11 for the Six per Cents. and 11 for the Ten per Cents. Upon the question of management most persons will agree, after what has lately been witnessed of the course of London boards, that a direction composed of leading merchants selected by English, French, and German shareholders, with an infusion of Government officials in a proportion to fix responsibility upon the State without conferring any power of action except such as may be sanctioned by an. independent majority, will at least be equal to any form yet devised. The separate interests and even jealousies of the merantile members would prove the best guarantee against any of them being allowed to carry out wild view,s of their own, and the influence of their respective 'Governments would b available in united force against any undue assumption on the part of the State or its nominees. Looldng at all these fea-
tures, and at the salutary effect which a regeneration of the currency and banking system of Turkey must exercise in developing her commerce, partica.. larly with Great Britain, there is every ground for desiring that the concession may be acted
upon withou1t delay, either by ourselves or by the native houses who are reported to be anxiots to obtain it. An additional satisfaction will be derived from witlnessing the unusual fact of a State with a depreciated currency meeting its obligations in full-an example itrikingly different from that set by Russia in former times under similar circumstances.
At a meeting of the Acadian Charcoal Iron Company held, to-day, Mr. .T. A. Roebhuck, P., in the chair, the repofTh detailing progress, of -which the following is an abstract, was adopted -- c
"' The existence in unlimited abundance of iron ores of the most valuable descri tione and of extensive forests of the finest' wood for the imlngi of charcoal, required for smelting the iron, has been corroborated by competent persons mnployed specially for thc purpose of making the requisite local examinations, as well as by the expetience of the workings. The iron that has been already received in this country is 'proved beyond all doubt to be of a qualitv to command a. ready sale a't the highest market price, and it is now being manufactured within the estimated cost. Several tons of malleable iron having'been sent to Sheffield to be mnanufactured into steel are stated by somo of the leading manufacturers to bo of the most excellent quality. Although there -has been -a greater delay than was- at Jrst alticipated in getting the works into a productive condition,. thc directors'think it right to state that this delay vias occasioned by a want of, local information incidental to the com' mencement of an undertaking like the . present. The inquiries that were made to obtain this information have occupled much' time, but were absolutely requisite before mahdng any expenditure on the part of the company. The time occupied by these inquiries aLso afforded an opportunit4 for improvement in the form of the furnaces, which bas materially increased the production, 'with a reducedconsumption of ore and fuel; and for preparing and storing before the, 31st of December, a quantity of ore and chircoal sufflcient to enable the company, with the supplies contracted for and now in course of regular delivery, to complete the remainder of this year's contract -with Her Majesty's Government, and to continue the smelting of further quantitics of pig iron, and to manufacture bar iron, for which there isa regular demand by the trade. A further cause of delay was, that the Government of Nova Scotia has during the last year drawn largely upon the ivailable labour in the country for the construction-of a railway from Halifax to Quebec, a portion of which is now open. This railwa passes the companiy's vorks at Londonierry, Nova Scotia,
and will be hi bly useful to them; but it deprived the com-. pany of mu-ca of their labour and raised the plice of the remainder. To obviate these inconveniences the directors bave selected and engaged a considerable numnber of the emigrants who, an the disbanding of the German Legion, were sent out to Nova Scotiaby Her Majesty's Government. These maen have been for some time at work; they place the com;y in an independent position as to labour, particularly as to skilled labour, the want of which had previously been severely felt. The accounts of the company hiave been duly audited. The accumulation of prepared ore and fuel at the works is very large, and together with the iron received and that on its way to this country wil amount in valuo to nearly 8,0001. As the navigation re. opens and permits further shipment this month to this country, the directors have every con-denoc that they 'will soon be in a position to pay a fair dividend upon the paild-up capital of the company."
The weekly reviews fronm the Amsterdam and Rotterdam produce-markets state that, although. business was less active, prices continued to be well supported. All the principal articles were dealt in to a moderate extent, but the speculative demand had almost wholly subsided. The letters from Rouen mention that the market for manufactures was inanimate, purchases having beenlimited, owina to the commencement of the Easter holydays. 0
The Amsterdam Bank has just declared a dividend of 152 guilders per share of l,OOO-nearly 15i. per cent.

RAILWAY CAPITTAT ANDTI RTP3VRN? A onnrrkTmco
It appears from a comparativesstatement of English" Scotch, and Irish capital and revenue accounts for th years 1855 and 1856, compiledby Mr. J. S. Yeats, of Warnford-court, that railway property has during the past year considerably improved in value, The compilatioi contains the prnucipal items of capital and revenue of 90 railways arranged m a clear and concise manner, with a view to present a uniform statement of the accounts of all the railways in the united kingdom which were open for traffic in 1855 and 1856. A statement of the capital and annual rentals of 46 leased lines is given. The total capital of the 136 railways amounted on the 31st of December, 186, to 295,708,7371., of which the sum of 248,773,67L. belonged to English lines, 32,270,9761. to Scoth lines, and 14,664,0901. to Irish lines. The total amount of capital at the end of 1855 was 288,705,632Z., showing an increase during the year 1856 of 7,003,0841., while the increase in dividend or interest charged to revenue was 1,168,561L, or 16 7 per cent. of the increase. The amount of dividend or interest charged in the year 1856 again.t revenue was 12,130,8611., or at the rate of 41. 2s. 0,d. per oent., and in the year 1855 10,962,3001, or at the rate of 31 15s. Ud. per cent., showing an increase of 1,168,a611., or 6s 1d. per cent., avlable for interest and dividend. Tlhe traffic receipts for the year 1855 amounted to 20,249,0721., and the working expenses to 9,957,5841., or 49'17 per cent., and for the year 1856 the traffic receipts amounted to 21,853,02U., and the working expenses to 10,311,9541., or 4718 per cent., showing an increase in the receipts of 1,603,9531., and of M54,3701. in the working expenses, being an increase of only 22 09 per cent, on the increased receipts ; but on the whole an increase in the receipts of 7-34 per cent., and a decrease of 1-99 per cent, in the working and other expenses.
The tradic receipts on the English lines amounted in 1856 to 18,613,8321., and the working expenses to 8,850,4231, or 47-54 per cent. ; on the Scotch lines the receipts amounted to 2,209,2291., and the working and other expenses to 1,041,7944, or 47-15 per cent. ; and on the Irish lnes the receipts amounted to 1,029,9641., and the wrorking expenses to 429,7371., or 41172 per cent., which latter does not include Government duty on passengers, because none is charged on Irish railways.
It appears that the dividends on the ordinary capital of Enghih railways in 1856 averaged 31. 17s. 71d. per cent. (which would have been more if the Great Ns,orthern had paid the last dividend they earned), against 31. 4s. 10Ad. in 1655 ; on the ordinary capital of Scotch lines to 21. 18s. Ojd. per cent. against 2t. 4s. 0Od. in 1855; and on Irish lines to 41. 4s. 1id. per cent. against 31. 13s. lld. per cent. in 1855, showing an improvement of 12s. 9id. per cent. in the ordinary dividend of the English railways; of 13s. 11.'d. per cent. in the ordinary dividend of the Scotch railways; and of lOs. 2id. per cent. in the ordinary dividend of the Irish railways. The average rate of dividend paid on the capital of English railways, including preference capital and capital of lea"ed lhes, amounted in 1856 to 41. 2s. 2id. against .31. 17s. 4Ad. in 1855; on the Scotch lines to 31. 13s. 9.}d. against 34 5s. 6.id. in 1855 ; and on the Irish lines to 41. 3s. 4d. against 31. 14s. 1.d. in 1855, showing inthe whole an increase in the return for capital I on the English railways of 4s. 10?d. per cent., on the Scotch
railways of 8s. 3d. per cent., and on the Irish lines of 9s. 2Ad. per cent. for the year 1856 as compared with 185D5

Hospital Nurses.
HOSPITAL NURSES.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TInES.
Sir,-I see by advertisements in your columns that the Nightingale Fund is about to be closed, and that hiss Nightingale is to establish an "1 institution for the training, sustenance, and protection of nurses and hospital attendants." No better application of the money could possibly bo made, and I am glad to see that the trustees haverejected the tempting offers made to them toadd aNightingalewing to this or A igitingale wards to that other hospital, in consideration of a special endowment from tho fund, and have resolved to devote the money to the object originally proposed. Hospital nurses have for the last year or two teen the victims of much unmerited abuse. They have their faults, but most of these may be laid to the want of proper treatnient. Lectured by committees, preached at by chaplains, scowled on by treasurers and stewards, scolded by matrons, sworn at by surgeons, buUied by dressers, grumbled at and alused by patients; insulted, if old and ill-favoured; talked flippantly to, if middle-aged and good-humouredtempted and seduced, if young and well-looking,-they are just what any woman might be, exposed to the same influences,-meek, pious, saucy, careless, drunken, or unchaste, according to circumstances or temperament; but mostly attentive, and rarely unkind. To such a class the institution projected by 'miss Nightingale, if properly supported by hospital authorities, must be of incalculah e benefit, and the advantages to the hbepitals quite as inestinable. Who, for instance, that has been inside an hospital, has not not constantly seen how nigently a traininginstitution was needed? A poor woman is left a widow with two or three children,-of course, quite unprovided for. What is she to do? She would starve on need -work; slh is unfit for domestic service, which besides is too poorly paid to enable her to maintain her childrenshe knows nobody to give her charring, and has no money to buy a mangle, of which there are already thrte in the court. So she thinks of an hospital as a natural refuge, as nursing is her nataral employment-gets a recommendation from a clergyman to a matron, is engaged, and turned into a ward to pick up a knowledge of her business as she best can; and her first experiences are usually sufficiently disgusting when sbe encounters an irritable surgeon, wbo expects to have everything ready to his band from a wretched woman in the last stage of anwiety and ntrvousness, whom no one has taken the trouble to teach even the names of things she is expected to be ready with.
But there is one thing not mentioned, althou h Miss Nightingale may have it in her mind, and which I would de-ire to press strongly on her attention, and that is a provision1 for nurses of good character in their old age. I have recently had brought to my knowledge two cases which mnay illustrate the need of such provision. They are those of two sisters of a large London hospitaL One of these poor women was in the service of the institution 22, and the other 24 years In the course of this time age bad come upon them, and they were not found so aotive a8 they had been 20 years before. It is reasonable to suppose they had good characters, or they would not have been retained in the eervice so long. However, they were discharged with a small gift, and when they have spent that tbey are allowed to eam a poor existence by doing drudgery in the same institution m which they had been sisters. Iacreasing infirmity will soon Prevent tbis, and then there oDly remain for them the workhouse and the grave. It is a very encouraging prospect for the other nurses, but I suppose there is no help for it, although large pensions can be tound for retired governors end matrons. I would recom. )merd these two poor women to MissNightingale's attention. One of them, I amn told, understood her business better than any other in the hospital, and, putting the patients out of consideration, was of the greatest use to numbers of drersers during their novitiate.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

No one can study the statistics relating to French population, and compare its failing power of increase with the progress of other nations, without being convinced that some great natural or social cause checks the vitality of the whole people. It is not as if the dhninution of increase were local, temporary, or dependent on certaiu political disorders; it has been gradual and pro
gresing, until now it seems that the total population is actually lessening. What makes the fact more singular is that such a condition of things is confined to France. The great and never-ceasing increase of the English race is notorious, and need not further be dwelt upon; but Germany and Russia have also shown no deficiency of prolific power. Although Muscovite Atatistics are hardly to be depended upon, it seems certain, from the testimony of travellers, that in the great territory of the CzA.
the human race is multiplying and extending. The progress of the Germans has been by no means unsatisfactory. It is true that narrowminded Governments and obsolete laws have done their worst to cheek development, and that the Fatherland does not, in fact, gain as much as it should from the increase of its sturdy and laborious race. But the Germans have during the present generation become a great emigrating people. There has been no want of activity at home. Witness the railways with which they covered their country before France had more than one or two experimental lines. Their chief activity, however, has been directed to the New World, and of late years they have poured out in numbers nearly equalling the Irish and far exceeding the genuine Anglo Saxons. Yet, with all this great drain, the population, except in some of the southern districts, increases by no means slowly. By mere relative increase of numbers the kingdom of Prussia and the empire of Austia may be considered as every day raising their position in regard to their neighbours to the south and west.
We might easily adopt the fashionable theory of race, and say that the Teutonic nations or the Slavonic nations are destined to become greater, while the Latin nations, with France at their head, are destined to remain as they are; but, after all, this kind of reasoning amounts to little more than saying that what is is. The question for us is ratbher to find a reason why such a people as the French, who otherwise show no signs of national decrepitude, who hold their high place in arms, in arts, in literature, and in political influence, whose language is more widely spread than ever, and whose country is the second countrjof every educated man, should have lost that power of increasing their population which is particularly active at present among the other great peoples of Europe. The facts of the case are strong and point to the outbreak of the first Revolution as the era from which this decline must be reckoned. Recent writers have narrated circumstances which corroborate and tend to explain the returns of the late census. For instance, it is declared that there has been a physical deterioration of the French race within the last 70 years. We are told that before 1789 the minimuum height for enlistment in the Line was 5 feet 1 inch, French measure. After a quarter of a century of war the minimum was reduced to less than 4 feet 10 inches, and in 1830 to less than 4 feet 9 inches. This standard was still further reduced during the reign of Lous PHnippE. If the same height were exacted now as under Louis XVI. more than 120,000 soldiers would have to be dismissed the service. Yet, although the requirements of the authorities are so much lessened, the rejections are in an inordinate ratio to the whole body of conscripts. In six years, from 1831 to 1837, 504,000 youths were admitted and 459,000 rejected. The deterioration, if we mav trust the statistics of the French writer whom -we quote, has gone on advancing. In the six years from 1839 to 1845 only 486,000 were admitted against 491,000 rejected. That is, actually more than half the conscripts were found unfit for military service, either through exceeding smallness of stature, weakness of body, or some other physical disqualification; and yet certainly the French armies are strikingly deficient in men either of size or muscular power. That more than half the population should fall short of the moderate standard required in the regiments which we see defile past in a French town is certainly a most surprising and startling fact. But for the explanation. It can hardly be doubted that the devastating wars of the Republic and the Empire have been the chief cause of this deterioration. One may see on pretty nearly every Parisian bookstall a large broadsheet exposed for sale entitled " Fastes MiZitaires." Opposite to every day in the year is the name of some victory or assumed victory won between 1792 and 1815. During those years the French fought more battles than we have since the beginning of our history, and their Generals of that time may be with accuracy called heroes of a hundred fights. But dearly has France paid for all this glory. It is no exaggeration to say that the entire vigorous male population of the country was swept away, leaving only the rejected of the conscription to be the fathers of a future generation. And when we remember that Lutzen and Bautzen and Leipsic were fought principally by boys whose year of enlistment was anticipated by the desperate EMPEBon, we may form some notion of what kind of men the conscription was likely to reject. It is indeed singular, and speaks well for the mettle of the race, that the present generation of French soldiers, smaller and weaker in body than any Europeans South of Lapland, should still be in spirit, in endurance, and in all those qualities which go by the name of " game," 'superior to perhaps any other in the world.
To the slaughter of the great war we must add the enforced division of property as a cause of deterioration and diminished population in France. We need not revive the discussion about large holdings and small holdings, because there are countries where one, and countries where the other, system is successful. The true principle is not that they should be small, or that they should be large, but that they should be free to be either, according to the exigencies of the culture and the instincts of the people. In this country, and in any other where the individual is enterprising and ambitious, petty agriculture would be impossible. The Englishman would get rid of the half-acre pateh which he had inherited, and would make his way to London or Manchester, or go to sea, or employ his labour in some way or another more profitably than by staying on his little piece of
ground. But the French peasantry, at a time I
when they were exhausted by war and uninvited
by any development of mercantile enterprise, first came under the action of a system which gave to each a bare subsistence in return for monotonous and spiritless labour. The enforced division of property has been, in fact, a law of entail of the worst kind, and each generation has inherited perforce the poverty and inertness of its predecessor. For forty years, and until lately, there has been hardly any improvement among the bankrupt and struggling proprietors of the soil of France, while the grasp of the mortgagees on the land has been yearly tightening. Who can wonder that the families of these people are not large, that they carry out to the letter the teachings of MALTUs and MnL, and deliberately marry ,with the intention of having only one or two children, or none at all? There has been no manufacturing industry to employ the increased numbers; there has been no education to inform them how they may rise to a higher station. The priest, the maire, has been but the instrument of Government, upholding the existing system. There has, in fact, been a perfect social stagnation, andwe cannot but believe that there is now less enlightenment and vitality in the rural districta of France compared,with the capital than in the days which preceded 1789. To the obliteration
by time and legiBlation of these two great evils,the physical deterioration caused by war and the social inertneJ3 caused by the extreme poverty of the great mass of the people,-must France, we think, look for the renewal of her energies and the inc.ease of her people.
Our despatches from India, which now com-
Our despatches from India, which now comprise intelligence from the Persian Gulf, show how inadequate are the agencies even of steam and electricity to fulfil all the conditions that might be desired. Although the Persian war has for some time been terminated by the conclusion of a treaty, we are still apprised of the progress of military operations, as if the campaign were to run an uninterrupted course. The design of Sir JAmzs Oum to make an attack upon the Persia. station at Mohammerah is now sufficiently explained. This town, situated at the conflux of the Karoon and the Euphrates, about 30 miles below Bussorah, commands the water communication by which supplies might reach our army at Bushire, and it is with a view of clearing this passage for the convoys coming down to us that the expedition against this place has been projected. As it is garrisoned, moreover, by a considerable force of Persians an opportunity would also be presented of dealing out to the enemy a repetition of the blow inflicted at Kooshab; but as it was thought that our forces, after securing the position, would immediately return to Bushire without attempting any advance into the interior, it may be hoped that tidings of the pacification will by that time have arrived to put a stop to the operations of war.
From India itself occurrences are related which show how much yet remains to be accomplished in divesting the Hindoo mind of the suspicions and delusions with which fanaticism oppresses it. Among the noEions inculcated by the Brahminical religion is the belief that certain things are so essentially impure as to defile those who taste or handle them; and the consequence of any such defilement is nothing less than loss of caste-the moat terrible penalty which a EHindoo can suffer. At Barrackpore--the great military station near Calcutta-some cartridges were served out for the practice of the troops with the new Enfield rifle. To facilitate the process of loading in this exercise it is necessary to grease the cartridge at one end, and a rumour was spread among the Sepoys that the fat used for this purpose was either bullockls fat or the fat of the hog -an impure animal. The result o/! this presumption was immediately shown in the serious disquie. tude of the troops,who imagined that the loss of caste would follow the use of this impure substance, and their prejudices were at first sO indulgently regarded by Government that the fat was withdrawn, and ghee-or clarified butter-substituted in its place. Presently, however, their minds were seized with another impression equally unfortunate, to the effect that the obnoxious substance had been used in the manufacture of the cartridge itself, and that it was therefore impoasible for them to escape the dreaded contact. Upon this they were addressed by the Brigadier in command, who assured them, apparently to their satisfaction, that no design whatever was entertained against their religious convictions; but we now learn that the uneasiness on this subject had extended northward from Barrackpore to Moorshedabad, where the soldiers of a native corps were only brought to reason by a demonstration of open force.
In these circumstances all who are acquainted with Indian history will at once recognize the recurrence of embarrassments and difliculties long since experienced. The fatal mutiny at Vellore in 1806 was an explosion originating in very similar persuasiont. On that voccason- a new headdress had been introduced, which offended the Sepoys, partly by its resemblance to the European hat, and partly from the belief that hogs skin was employed in the manufacture of the cockade. Political disaffection, too, had its share in the revolt, and just as intrigues of the Eing of OUDE are spoken of, probably without the least foundation, at the present time, the machinations of TDrpoo's family, with far more reason, were referred to 50 years ago. Our position, however, in India has E en so largely strengthened since those times that we can look with much less alarm to the or3ration of these impracticable delusions. It -will be seen in our correspondence that the cavalry at Moorshedabad could have been cor4idently relied upon, if necessary, to act against their brethren of the line-a circumstance in some degree explained by the preponderance of Mussulmans in one of these arms and Hindoos in the other. But besides the aid, always available in such emergencies, of cavalry and artillery, we have now a valuable resource in those irregular battalions which have been raised in large numbers from the various populations recently brought under our rule. A few years ago one of the Bengal regiments was actuaUy disbanded for mutinous conduct, and replaced by a corps of Goorkhas; while on this very occas;on 2,000 Sikhs would have been brought up to Moorshedabad if the alarm had continued. The evidence, however, borne by these events to the tenacity of Hindoo prejudices is somewhat discouraging after all our reforms, our schools; and our railways. We might have looked by this time for better things. We have abolished suttee and infanticide; we have seen the marriage of widows tolerated, and there is no longer the old difficulty in getting Sepoys to go on distant service. We should be glad to learn that the present delusion is exceptional and transient, and it is not a little remarkable that in the same letter of our correspondent which relates the disturbance about the cartridges it is stated, with reterence to Hindoos and their agriculture, that " the ' native prejudices' we are so fond of talking "about never stand in the way of their interest. "I saw a Parsee, a Brahmin, a mehter (scavenger), "and an Englishman all sitting on the same seat "in the railway the other day, and all profoundly "indifferent to the outrage on their respective " superstitions."
From these, however, and other incidents mentioned in our correspondence it is obvious to draw a moral as to the necessity of maintaining a sufficient force of European troops on our Indian establishments. Large, indeed, as are the military forces of our empire in the East, it cannot fail to be observed that any extraordinary demand on behalf of distant operations creates always an undesirable amount of pressure, and usually denudes some stations of their proper garrisons. This result will cease to be surprising if we consider the
proportions whicl all Indian expeditions seem unavoidably to assume, and the numerous points on which action may be called for. The army under the command of General OuTrxAr may appear small in itself, and it would, indeed, have been insufficient for its work had the war been continned; but this is only one force out of several whbich circumstances were thought likely to reqnire. It is said that an expedition was contemplated from Shikarpore, in the direction of Candabar; and a march to Cabul was speculated on as the probable service of the large body of troops assembled at Peshawur. At this moment the proceedings of a hill tribe beyond the Indus are demanding immediate correction, and the mere unruliness of a band of robbers will provide with occupation a force of infantry, cavalry, and artOlery, amounting in reality to little less than a well appointed army. All this while, too, there is Oude to be watched and Burmah to be preserved, ithough it is satisfactory to remark
that the disturbance lately announced in the latter province seems tolhave dwindled to the dimensions of ordinary brigandage, while the progres of the country itself is reported in terms of unqualified approbation. We now possess the delta lands of the Ganges, the Indus, and the Irrawaddy-three of the richest rivers of the Eaat,-and, as far as territory can bring wealth, all the sources of opulence are at our command. Unhappily, as every year proves, the tranquillity of these vast possessions can be insured only at the cost of large military establishments; but as the power which secures our own dominion shields also the life and property of millions -as the prosperity of India stands on the same basis with the authority of Britain-as it is to the protection and inlluence of our Government that Hindoos must look for the advancement of their race and country-we may accept tho obligation imposed upon us with less regret, and employ at once the right and might of conquerors in the true interests of the empire committed to our cre.
Time was when the profession of the Filibuster
Time was when the profession of the Filibuster was an honoured one on the islets and keys of the Caribbean Sea. The sea rover and the bucanier then constituted the chivalry of this beautiful region and of the long seaboard of the North American continent. The traditions of their bloody adventures have come down to us mellowed and chastened by the softening influences of time, yet even when seen in the Far West of memory enough of horror clings to the recitals to show us that the Filibuster's calling, even in those days, was a rough season's roughest work. Whatever might have been the case then, thus much at least is clear,-that modern civilization refuses to recognize the heroic element in these exceptional vocations. The pirate now-o'-dsya is run up to the yardarm or reserved for the gallows at the nearest port, without scruple and with little pretence of sympathy. Fair ladies, even in their perennial lachrymatories, have not a single tear for the modern Tuiwms and DuviLs, who are tried regularly at the Assizes or at the Central Criminal Court, and as regularly executed, unless the Home Secretary commutes their punishment into incarceration, and banishment, and hard labour for life. There is, indeed, au occasional and partial outbreak of morbid sympathy for some particular criminal, but still the opinion of the majority takes its course, and crime for the most part receives its due return. There has been of late years but one exception to this rule, and that has existed in the United States of America. We will not be so unjust as to say that even in the great Northern Confederation public opinion has been in favour of Filibusterism; a concumrence of circumstances combined to produce the res*lt. It was known that territorial extension in various directions was desired by aU classes; there was an infinite variety of local Governments; the Central Executive was feeble, and not easily roued to action; there was dispersed throughout the States a floating population of desperadoes, the offscourings of Europe-men without national feeling, and scarcely with human hearts; finaUy, the tribes or nations against which attack was directed were of so savage and debased a characterwith the exception of Cuba-that it could not be supposed the distant nations of the Western world would take much interest in their fate. The time, however, has arrived when, even in the States, this disgraceful practice seems to have fallen into such disrepute that the public force of the country will be effectuaUy exercised for its repression. We would not attach too much importance to the declaration of a newly elected President, who on the occasion ef his inauguration necessarily speaks, like the PoPp from the Gallery of St. Peter's on Easter Sunday, to the world at large. MIr. Buc Awx's expression of a just and pacific policy cannot, however, be wholly disregarded; for if a ruler sets his face against unjust wars in general he can scarcely countenance Filibusterism, which is to organized warfare what murder and burglary are to those great contests of nations by flood and field which make ambition virtue. If oppression and usurpation and injustice are to be worked out, by all means let the direction of affairs rather be intrusted to Statesmen and Generals and Admirals than be left in the hands of reckless adventurers like WALKEE of Nicaragua, who produce an infinite amount of humanu misery without any ultimate or correlative benefit to mankind. The citizens of the United States shonld consider that one such enterprise as that of WALKER works them far more harm in the public opinion of Europe than any considerable operation of war, which, although undertaken on insufficient grounds, may yet be extenuated, if not justified, by the precedents of other nations and the sanguinary chronicles of Western conquerors.
WVALKFn, if we are to judge by the accounts weI have just received, is at his very last gasp. It is not only that he has been foiled in the operations he had undertaken, nor even that his communications with the seaboard of the Isthmus, and consequently with the United States, had been cut off; far worse than this remains behind. Sickness and famine had decimated his ranks, which he could not replenish, and the survivors, undeterred by the terror of his threatenings and the sight of his military executions, were deserviug to the Costa Ricans in large bodies. So long as the process had been carried on piecemeal, and the men had left his lines by twos and threes, by fives even, and by tens, it was not impossible for him to catch the runaways, and a very simple matter to kill them as a warning to others, so long as those others could be found to level their muskets against the breasts of their comrades. We are now informed that of the 500 men whom he had left a body of 126 went over to the Costa Rican lines and surrendered. The Costa Ricans behaved with sound policy as well as with great humanity towards the fugitives. Theyreceived them kindly, and gave them food and clothing and a free passage to the United States. We have received an address to their fellow-soldiers yet with WrALKPE, which 70 of their number signed before quitting the country into which they had been so villanously entrapped, and where they had endured such terrible sufferings. " What benefit," say the subscribers, " have you received or are "you likely to receive from the hard-fought battles "of Rivas-first and second, Virgin Bay, Masaya,
or Granada, or the terrible sufferings of the "return from Santa Rosa? Think of the horrors "of the siege of Granada, where the sick "and dying lay mingled with the dead and "wounded; where innocent and helpless women "and children were dying in your very sight from "privation and sickness, while you yourselves "w were supporting a feeble strength upon unnatural " and loathsome food !" Of IVAtLK himself, as might be well supposed, the fugitives speak in t(rms of the profoundest execration, and invite their former comrades to follow their example, and desert to the Costa Rican lines. So great was the effect of these invitations, that within a very few days WVALKER lost half of his little army by desertion. Meanwhile the various Central American Governments had entered into ii*`arrangements with regard to Nicaragua as would have the effect of annihilating the political existence of that State, and, union being so far restored, the net
was drawn closer and closer every day round the little remnant of WAtLEix's force, which, in al
probability, at the time we write has ceasedl to have any organized military existeno, This, tlhen,
is the ena of this ill-starred- expdition, whichA probably within a limited area, and amongaspe ue population, produced as great an amount of human misery as any similar foray upon record. The inhabitants have perished in great numbers by fire, by famine, by pestilence, by the sword. The slege of Granada alone would be suicient-to give an unhappy immortality to WALrEes enterprise had that been the only event in the foray, so horrible were the sufferings endured on either iide during its continuance. We must not, however, forget the wrongs endured and the privations suffered by the wretched creatures whom the Fibuster had allured beneath his banners from, the States, under the pretence that they were tQ weoeve allotments as colonists, and inplements to till theo soil, and seed for their future harvest. As soon as they reached the shore of the presumed EL Dorado they were at once seized by Wsizxes agents, and compelled to bear arms, despite of al their remonstranees. No one who has read merely the account of miseries which soldiers regulay enlisted in the service of any civilized Power have endured can form an idea of the tortures inflicted upon theso miserable creatures. WALKpa was not only compelled to fight battles in an unhealthy climate with a most insufficient force-that force consisting of civilians who had been just entrapped by his crimps-but he was under the necessity of taking greater precautions against his own men even than against the enemy. Terror was the. agent with which he worked-hence an unsparing recourse to military executions. He himself sat as judge without appeal, and his suspicions 'were his law. The good effect that may be expected from this mass of human calamity is that the qstem of Filibusterism, as practised for too many years past, indirectly under the auspices, and certainly with the connivance, of the Inited States, may receive its deathblow.. Even among the desperate men who commonly engage in audi enterprises can it be supposed that the inlibuster's trade will any longer be a popular one, when they have learnt by the fatal experience of WAj. es companions what that trade really means? Surely the " Lone Staf' and other such romantic symbols will have lost somewhat of their charm when it is ascertained that the bright luminary simply shines over the forgotten pits into which their mangled and emaciated bodies may have been cast.
We have for several years past most urgently and
We have for several years past most urgently and consistently opposed any further expedition to the Polar Seas in search of the relics of the Erebus and Terror. We are fully persuaded that many years ago the last survivor of the unfortunate expedition in which Sir JomN FRAnw- and his companions were engaged had ceased to exist. We rejoiced inl the recent determination of the Admiralty not to throw aWay good lives after bad, and to refuse absolutely the countenance of the Government to any further explorations in the Polar Seas with the hope of recovering that which had long since perished. When we say thus much it wMill not be supposed that we are asking for any assistance from the public authorities, or even from the public, towards a new expedition which Lady Fp.A 7xaW has set on foot. This lady, as we have been given to understand, has embarked the last relics of her fortune in an ultimate expedition, which is to be directed towards that particular spot of the Polar regions where tidings may be expected from the Eaquiamaux of the lost voyagers. The expedition we believe to be a Quixotic one; but who will venture to speak with disrespect, or even with iifference, of the efforts-ay, of the desperation of Lady FREANLW, in such a cause ? Looking at the matter as one of plain common sense, we believe that speedier and cheaper access to the region in question might be obtained by overland and smallerexcursions from the extreme settlements of the Hudson's Bay Company; but Lady FRAsuTxu
has resolved upon a final expedition by sea, and therefore we can only say "GOD speed" to the adventurers in so noble a cause. Public assistance to this bereaved lady might have been given in one way. What if the old Resolute had been handed over to her as a gift from the English public? The seabattered and ice-worn sbip might thus have been turned to some account, and Lady FRAxLnyW might possibly have been saved some expense. We can form no favourable expectations as to the results which may be looked for from this last Arctic Expedition; but, as far as Lady FAzmW&rn
is concerned, she has every right to the sympathy of her fellow-countrymen.
THE INDIAN MATERIA MEDICA.-The Government
THE I DIAN MATZIUA mI cA. -The Grovernneut of India pays upwards of 40,0001. a-year for quinine alone. Notwithstanding this vast expenditure the supply might be tripled with advantage. Indents for quinine are Jelonsly watched. At civil stations it is almost refused, and durinz au outbreak of fever it is always the first article to faf short, and the last to be sufficiently replaced. Of the cost of the remaining drugs we are not informed, but it cam scarcely fall short of something like 30 lacs of ruees a- year. These two figures are sufficient to prove the unportance in an economical view of the substitution of native drugs. On the important benefits their introduction, or rather discovery, would confer upon the poople, it is needless to enlarge. To the mass of the population English medicines are totally inaccessible. Almost alone among imported goods drugs maintain the price they bore in the good old days before the Pagoda tree had been shaken into barrenness. Men in sickness do not ask the price of medicine. The vendors have every interest in maiutaining it. Doctors have little interest in its rcduction, and so the good old profitable rates are allowed quietly to endure. The natives do the best they can, Eonetines reviving under drugs that would hUll any othler race of human beings, but usually dying of attack-s which the Englishman regards as temporary iUs. The evil and its remedy are both understood, and have been pointed out about once a-week during the half of the past century. Yet we have done nothing towards obtaining the remedy we all know to exist. There is probably not a medicine imported frim Europe, not a costly drug from South America, which has not its counterpart in India. What have we done to discover them? Doctors living alone, without communication with their brethren, occasionally stumble on some valuable plant, some febrifuge or substitute for catechu. They cure all around, satisfy themselves of the correctness of their views, and report to the medical board. The white ants eat the report with gusto, the doctor moves on disheartened to his next station, and there the matter ends. It is useless for the advocates of these effete institutions to ti"k of the valuable investigations thev have suggested or proposed. Howr many English drugs have they displaced within this generation ? It is a result, not a report that is required, and the only one obtained is an immense expenditure. At the present moment there is a committee sitting to ascertain wrbat articles now imported from Europe can be obtained in India. Howmany drups will that committee condemn? WewiUventuretopredictnotone, though every member *. it has probably some vague idea that all the English medicinescan ba replaced. We need an officer specially ap pointed for this duty, with power to make researches thuhboutIndia, and to compel theservicestoaid hina. Usually aU information obtained will be willingly laced at his disposal. It is hopelessness rather than want o energy whichleads so many surgeons toleave theirinformation inaccurate or half-digested.4 No man with brains to devote himself to study wiU submit his wrork toa board selected for its age, and still leat t l a board 'which is regarded as a se-

A skilled chymist, communt-. cating with all India, testing every drug, and bringing all e±perience into onalocus, would do more in a year to ascer tain the true quaities of the native pharmacopceia than the boards wi5l accomplist in a century. Such an officer wculd be no very expenaslv addition to the staff of the medical ssnice.-BRnmbap lTleyrapmh

TRLE PERSIAN WAR.
(FROI AN OCCASIONAL CORnESPONDIN'T.)
CAMP BEFORE BIJSHIRE, FEB. 25.
Since my last communication little of interest has occurred in this quarter worthy of being recorded. Owing to the non-arrival of the remaining portion of the Second Divison, which was confidently expected here ten days ago, as well as in consequence of the strong north-westerly gales which have prevailed, and which have prevented all intlercourse with the shipping in the harbour, the Mobammerah expedition has been delayed. The day before yesterday, however, it was found practicable to get the Semiramis and Berenice steamers under way. They took in tow the Ocean Monarch and the Futtey Mobarek, with one battery of artillery, a corps of dooly-bearers, stores, &c., as also three gunboats. These will be dropped near the estuary of the Shatt-ool-Arab, there to await the remaining part of the force destined to capture and garrison Mohamnmerah. The steamers will return immediately, and the Hon. Mr. Murray, who goes up in the Beren ice, will be made over to the Comet, which will take him as far as Basra, whence he is to make his own way to Bagdad.
Captain Kembal], Resident at Bagdad, arrived here a few days ago, and reports that the garrison of Mohammerah has been increased, and that 13 guns have been mounted in the embrasures of the forts. The Arabs in that quarter appear to be in
anxious expectation of our approach, which, it is I to be feared, will be the signal of a general rising of the tribes against their Persian master. It will require a little diplomacy to prevent these wild clans from committing every kind of excess, and at the same time to keep on good terms with them ourselves. The latter is absolutely necessary to the success of our operations generally, for one great object in seizing Mohammerah is to open out the resources of that district to the wants of our army.
The officers employed in procuring baggage-cattle report that 5,000 camels w;ill be ready in the course of a fortnight. Mules also are being bought up at s3agdad and Mosul, but I fear it will be several months ere a number suficient to enable our army to advance from Bushire is procured. This, perhaps, is the less to be regretted, since without large additional reinforcements, especially European, it wvould be imprudent to think of advancing beyond Shiraz. The operations of our Generp.l are, indeed, even now very much crippled for want of troops. The entire army, when the whole of the Second Division arrives, viw not amount to more than 10,000 men of all arms. From 3,000 to 4,000 of these will advance to Mohammerah. and a good moiety of that number must remain to garrison it. I believe that an advance thence to Shuster and Dizful might easily be made with the co-operation of the tribes, but such a course would be worse than useless unless Sir James could leave adequate garrisons in those places. He cannot detach more men from before Bushire while the enemy maintain their position below the passes. Rumour gives their numbers there at from 5,000 to 25,000 men, with 8 or 90 guns, and reports still prevail of many regiments being on their way from Isaphan and Teheran. Again, the Bazaar report is that the Serkesheekshi Bashi, or Commandant of the King's body-guard, in company with Hamza Mirza, the Shah's uncle, is on bis way from Teheran, empowered to conclude a treaty of peace. If this is reaUy the case, and we are able to secure ev.n our principal objects, I trust tbat no bone of contention will be raised on our side, and that an end may be made of this war. On the other hand, however, sbouild no such overtures be made by Persia, 'we must, as far as 1 can see, be prepared for a serious struggle; and, if Herat is the stumblingblock, that must be renoved out of the way by our taking possession of ii. Averse as England and India may be to undertak;e military operations in that quarter, she wvill ultimately be driven to it, since it is not difficult to foresee that the eventualities of the war in this direction may lead to the occupation of Herat by Russian troops. We should seek to strengthen Persia, and that we might more readily do by holding Eerat than by any other means. We could then aford to be less suspicious of the Persians, and perhaps more generous towards them, than we I,ave been, despite their insincerity and perfidy. WVhy Affghanistau shonld be such a bugbear to the English public no military man appears to understand. Our position on the Indus is now totally different from wbat it was at the period of our disastrous retreat, and the Affghans themselves know us better. Besides, what security bave we, in the actual circumstances of the reigning dynasty there, that after the demice of the Dost one or more of the aspirants to the musnud will not se3k the protection of the Persians, or even of the Russians, against British interests in Affghanistan?
After-reports from the adjoining neighbourhood lead us to believe that many more of the Persiaus were killed at the battle of Kooshab than we ourselves believed. Hundreds of the wounded were said to be strewn near the river Daliki, and from a'l accounts the blow then struck has quite disorganized the army under Soojah-ool-Moolk, who, if rumour speaks truly, has been displaced from his command. It is now becoming the prevailing opinion that the Persians will not again meet us on the plain, but in cac:e of.our approach will retire into the passes, and there dispute our onward progress. The camp at Bushire is being fortified with strong redoubts ; the force is remarkably healthy, and a good tone generally prevails among officers and men. Lord Seymour arrived the other day from Bagdad, and has been appointed, for the present, assistant to Major Taylor, in the political department. We understand that this young nobleman is anxious to obtain some military oflice,in order to enable him to take an active part in the war..

Clergymen On The Hustings.
CLERGYMEN ON THE HUSTING&%
TO THE EDITOl OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Looking over some late Timns I observed a para. graph in that of Monday, the 6th of April, headed " Clergymen on the Hustings." Your correspondent "J. L. S." Instances various counntis in which during the last general dection clergymen have Proposed and seconded candidates, and he disapproves both of their appearance on the hustings and of their employment as magistrates, which latter office, he thinks, leads them to mingle in the business of electiong. Among the counties mentioned is Herefordshire.
Now, I tbink "J. L. S." reasons on a limited v ew of facts. The facts connected with the county of Hereford I personally know, and a statement of them may, perhap., enlarge the idea he suggests of a clergyman's situation.
The three gentlemen he mentions in that county as secondiDg the nomination of candidates are owners of large landed property as well as clergymen. They hold no church prefeiment, but, whether they did or not, they and clergymen generally, in common with all other men, when they are employed in carrying out the laws and institutions of their country, are working by that means towards the ends of 'quietness, peace, and love." The better clergymen they are, the better magistrates and judges are they likely to be. The election of representatives to carry out those views which Englishmen form respecting the government of their country is one of the duties of an Englishman, and the spirit in which elections are conducted depends on the tenper and principles of the electors. It is surely an error to limit the idea of the hustings to that of a scene of riot and pal y violence. The clergyman has a duty to perform there, and it is with that viewheand everyothervoter should comle. vr te oe
There are two instances in Herefordshire of clergymen who have 1,ecome peers by the accidents of death and unexpected succession-the late Lord Hereford and the present Lord Saye and Sele. These two clergymen took their seats in Parliament, as in duty bound to do, and exercised the other duties of their new position. Ordained commoners whose position has been altered by similar changes act, of course, in a similar manner. For instance, these Herefordsh1re lndowners fulfil the offices of countzy gentlemen of large property, and according to their diligence in dis^harging their obligations best do their duty in that state of life to which it has pleased God to call them.
A clergyman's general duties are bounded by the timae wbich his peculiar clerical duties leave him; and the fair treatment both of the cl.rgy aud the country would be to throw open every office of the constitution to those unbereficed clergymen whom circumstauces engage to renounce permanently the charge of a living.
Your obedient servant.

The Free Pubhl Library was opened in uctober, 1852, in temporary premises in Duke-street, where the collection in natural history belonging to the late Earl of Derby, by whom it was bequeathed to the town, was removed. The library was openied with 10,000 volumes, wbich number had increased to 21,021 in August, 1856, exclusive of 13,524 books in two free lending librarie, one in the North and the other in the South district. The proceedings of the day will commence with the peesentation of addresses to M.r. Brown, at theTown-hal after -which that gentleman, tbe guests, visitors, and otler. will march in procession to the site of the building, and, after the ceremony of lying the stone, a banquet will b' held in St. George's-ball.

TIPPERARY COUNTY.
The O'Donoghue and Mr. Waidron were yesterday returned without opposition.
The state of the poll on the first day leaves little doubt as to the resalt of the contest for the county of Dublin. The old Dublin brigade is left intact, and six of Lord Derby'is most strenuous Irish adherentswiUl resume their accustomed places in the new Parliament. No one is surprised at the failure of Sir Charles Domvlle. He may have meant well, but he has yet, much to learn of the tactics of electioneering, and his perfect sinplicity in the art, the conseqnence, it may be, of a first attempt, will account for the indifferent stand he haa made against the return of Colonel Taylor, for, as already stated, of Mr. J. H. Hamilton's re-election there never was the slightest dovbt. Sir Charles's attempt to coerce his tenantry to support Mr. John Reynolds in the city, his depreciation of the "vill
owners," and other slips have all told in the longrun, and have been turned to the utmost advantage by artists better skilled than the hon. baronet in the devices incidental to a contested election. All the accounts from Galway continue to speak in terms of congratulation at the release of that county from the thraldom of Dr. MacHale. After all, the conte3t has not beenfought upon the old and used-up sectarian grounds. It was literally a battle for lay independence as opposed to spiritual supremacy in temporal matters; and it is but justice to mention that many of the Roman Catholio clergy and one of the bishops by their support of the Liberal Protestant candidat3 showed an equal distaste to the intolerable dictation of the great Western autocrat, A letter from Galway dated Saturday says-

The first day's poll at Wicklow pretty plainly intimated that there, as well as in Dublin, the old members are quite safe, and that the Whig, Lord Milton, and the Tory. Mr. Humne, are sure of a renewal of their Parliamentary lease. The Hon. Capain Monck was too late in the field; had he been earlier there would have been a reasonrble chaace of his displacing the Derbyite candidate. In Clare the Conyng. ham interest has completely triumphed, and Loid Francis heads the poll by a sweeping majority. Mr. Luke Whito has retreated from the perils of a contest, with three candidatcoef kindroap olitioo i.a thb oounty of ClAra. flis reasons for taldng this anexpected step are thus set forth in his letter of resignation:-

Mr. Hamilton O'Hara's futile attempt to storm tha county of Antrim has ended, as every one knew it would. Colonel Pakenham is, as a soldier, popular with all clases. and his ultra-Tor3ism endears him to the gentry. Mr. George Macartney is not an especial favourite, but the electors are too much wedded to old prejudices to cast him aside to make way for a geutleman professing Liberalism to a pitch that would have startled any constituency in Munster or Connaught.
The Home-In-The-East Reformatory.-The an-
TRE Ho-nr-iN-TRE-EAsT REroRsuAToRy.-The arnual meeting of the friends of this institution was held yesterday at the Home, Old Ford, Bow, when in the absence of the President, the Earl of Shaftesbury, who forwarded 101. towards the emigration of the most deserving inmates, the Itev. G. T. Driefild, the Rector of Bow, presided. Previous to the meeting a numerous party of ladies and gentlemen, including a large number of the clergy, assembled at the Home, and went through the different departments, expressing their approval of the entire arrangements, and their admiration of the cleanliness and orderly behaviour of the boys. The company then assembled in the schoolroom, where they were addressed by the Chairman, who entered into details of the origin of the Home, from which it appeared that a single person in Stepney first called in a number of boys, vwho bad formerlv run wild about the streets, to assist him in his business, and, when he had inured them to habits of industry and application, some clergymen and otheri remroved them to this place, and thus founded the Home in theEast. The rev. gentleman then went through the course of moral and mental cultivation adopted in the irstitution, bore testimony to its proper management, and lauded it as one of the many steps in the right direction towards carrying forward the reformatory movement. The report, a very interesting document, read by the secretarv, Mr. A. J. Scrutton, entered at length into the plan which had been adopted in the Home, and the rssrlts attending it. Of 88 boys admitted in 15 months (the period embraced in the report) the history of 62 was given-14 were orphans, 12 had no mother, 11 no father, 8
ad step-parents, an4 17 both pareats still living; 15 had been in prison once, the same number twice, and the same number from three to nine times, while 17 had been guilty of tbefts, but saved from prison by the leniency of their victimas; 28 had been admitted on the recommendation of the chaplains of the metropolitan prisons, 21 on the application of friends, 9 by paren's, and 4 by commitments under the recent Act of Parliament ; 36 had been in a dayschool, 23 in a Sunday-school, 26 could neither read nor wvite; and of the 36 who had been in a daysobool not one-balf possessed more than the first elements of reading, and few knew anything of writing and cyphering. Payments had been made by parents and otheis for three boys, at 7s. a-week; for 15, at 5s. ; for three, at 4s. ; for one, at 3s. ; for ten, at 2s. 6d.; for four, at 2s.; and for one, at Is. On the question of mental control the Govsrnor of the Hone reported, that the cause of the fall of these boys, in most cases, was the bad examples of their parents, ill-conducted homes, and in many ceses by the father being a drunkard, andtbe mother leaving home to support the family, when the children being left to take care of themselves became acquainted with bad associates, and their dowvnfall followed. The majority of admissions consisted of tlhe utterly depraved aud destitute, many of whom had had no home for years,
excepting a night's shelter under a railway arch or in a cart. During the 15 months 65 boys had left the Home, of whom 10 had absconded before the probation and nine after, 12 had left voluntarily, three been dismissed, one put in prison,and two in tbe workbouse. 37boys had thus left the Homeundercircumstances which were notencourag. ing, but over which the committee had no control. Besides tbat number, eight bad been taken home and provided for by their fnends 17 had left for situations, and seven had behaved so well that they had been sent out to Canada a few days since at the expense of the institution. The report gave several cases of boys having met wihh great success after leaving, and concluded with pn earnest appeal to the charitable for an increased amount of support. The financial statement showed the expenditure to have amounted to 9481. 17s. lld., exceeding the income by 1411. 10s. 3d., and on the specia fund there was a debt of 2161. 19s. 4d., and an expenditure of 3561. 12s. 6d. The report was adopted, and the followingresolution, moved by Mr
. Payne, and seconded by theRev.E. J. Hatch, cbaplain of Wandsworth Gaol, 'Rmanimously areed to:-" That this meeting, gratefully xecognizing the beneficial results of the present reformatory movement throughout the country, is especialy convinced that juvenie reformatories are essential to lessening tbe growth of crime awong the large criminal population of the land." Otber resolutions in furtherance of the objeets of the institution were also passed, the speakers being the Rer. Dr. E[elvlethe Rhe Rev. S. Davies, 31r. Greaves, Mr. T. Scrutton, and other gentlemen.

Her Majesty's Theatre.
ERB MAJESTY'S TIJATRE.
The Mane that took place withia the wlvls of the Opera house when, aftor two blank seAsons, it re.opened last year, will not readily be forgotten by any one who witnessed it. There have been noisier demonstrations of every emotion of which the human heart is susoeptible, but never was the expression of thorough contentment more generally and obviously diffused among an assembled multitude. The habituta of the old establishment, who had been compelled to follow a sort of nomadic life, rejoiced greatly to find themselves once more at home, Mr. Lumley's re-appearance :n his ancient domain was a #ort of " Restoration" in the dyes of operatio Cajaliers.
The joy evinoed on the occasion of a. "Restoratione is by no means a lure earnest of the popularity of a dynasty. Everybody is delighted to see an old friend, after along absence, on the mere strength of his oldness, without the slightest reference to his merit or intellectual qualities; but when the hand has cooled from the effect of the first shake, and two or three reminiscences have been conned over and laughed at, a man is often surprised to find what a consummate "bore" his old friend has become. The ova'ions that took plae in May, 1660, were no preven. tive agains the events of 1688. In spite of the scene thst distinguished the early summer of 1856, those who did not sympathize with the operatic Cavaliers might atill murmur that lyrical kingdoms are rather more than less susceptible of revolution than States political, and that nowhere did the sins of misgovernment and the discontent of the multitude find a practica expression more rapidly hau within the walls of a theatre.
However, the operatio event of May, 1856, more fortunate than the political event of MaUy, 1660, was followed by no reaction. The delight expressed on witnessingthe re-opening of the old house was fully equalled byadetermination on the part of the public tokeep it open. Al persons who survey the facts of last ummeer in a calm historical spirit Will admit, whatever may be theircritical views, thatMademoiselle Piocolomini was the Iyrical "lion" of the season The affection for tho old house being backed up by admiration for the new vocalist, the constitution was without any internal ailment that could undermine its security. A luckless singer or two of the second rank might indeed achieve his cr her little flasco, but this would no more endanger.the general edifice than the delinquency of a sniserable pickpocket would ruffle the sublime tranquillity of Hobbee, "Leviathan." So permanently popular is Her Majesty's Theatre that at the end of the autumn, when people had forgotten to think about Italian operas altogether, save as things to stsrt up, like spinach, In the ensuing spring, Mr. Lumley astonished the world by opening his house on two nightg, and such was the force of the attraction, that his superabundant friends threatened to become his invaders, and, in spite of the remonstrances of strenuous gatekeepers, essayed to storm the palace out of pura loyalty. To find an -nalogy to the scene that took place on the 25th of last October, we must fancy the events at the Tuileries on the 20th of June, 1792, all resulting from sheer love and enthusiasm for Louis XVL
The aspect the house last night presented, when the doors were opened for the season of 1857, gave evidence of continued prosperity. All the boxes and stalls were occupied; every item of the entertainment was received with unequivocal signs of gratification; the lessee was enthusiasticaly called; so were the principal voclists; not a single manifestation of success was wanting.
Respecting the new tenor, Signior Giuglini, who made his first appearance last night in La Fwvorita, the greatest curiosity prevailed. Rumours had been spread to the effcct that he was lookled upon as a vocal wonder in his native Italy, and the statement, widely circulated, that tho Emperor of Austria, unable tD get him sooner, has joyfully ,ecured him for the year 18, was just the sort of thing that even those who might not comprehend the mysteries of an aesthetical dissertation could fully appreciate.
The very first aria executed by Signor Giuglini convinced his auditors that he was not one of those vocalists who look Eo large in the columns of an Italian or Spanish newspaper and sound so snall when they reach a London or Parisian stage. The compass of the voice was evidently extensive, and, moreover, even throughout, without any breaks in the high or low places, the notes all came from the chest, the intonation was faultless, and the tender emotions of the earlier scenes were expressed with genuine feeling. But when, discovering that his King has fobbed him off with an unworthy marriage, the newly made noble dashes his order upon the ground and breaks his sword across his knee, there was a spirit in Signor Giuglini's action and a force in his voice from which it was easy to be seen that the gentle lover of the first act had given slight hints rather than full dcemonstratlona of hia strength. The pleasure of the audience was heightened to admiration, and great things were expected in the third (properly the fourth) act, where the lovers meet in the convent, and renew the protestations of an affection that has been so sadly crossed. The beautiful aria, " Spirto Gentil," in which the solitary Fernando abstracts himself from the vices of his lost bride and indulges in mystical contemplation of herbeauty, isrevealed to his mind's eye, was given with the most exquisite feeling imaginable, the voice being thoroughly subdued down to asl the humility of hopeless misery, but fuUy sonorous and distinct throughout. It was a lyrical wail, kept within the bounds of the best taste, and the falsetto notes-which the vocalist now introduced for the first time-seemed wondrously accordant vwith the anguish assumed. A lunanimous demand for an encorc immediately followed the conclusion of the aria, and consideration for the singer alone prevented the honour from bc:ing repeated. There is nothing very extraor. dinary in applause at the song, but the entranced manner in vvhich the audience hung upon the notes of this aria, as they were so softly and smoothly poured forth by Signor Giuglini, and the sudden change from rapt attention into noisy enthusiasm made up a compound effect that is only witnessed on the occasion of genuine triumphs. From this moment the vocalist seemed inspired, and when the lady of his thoughts became bodily present, and ho reproached her with the incorrectness of her position at Court, he reached the perfection of musical declamation. The voice, in which power had hitherto seemed the least remarkable quality,now reverberated through thehouse,gaining volume from the assumed rage of the singer. When the curtain feil three enthusiastic calls brought Signor Giuglini and MademoiseUe Spezia as many times to the lamps, and then the ha&ititis, having first summoned Mr. Lunmley into their presence and honoured him with a thunder of congratulations, retired into the lobby to discuss the events of the evening. The success of the new tenor was on every tongue, and the only question was, how far we must look back to find a like triumphant dMt of the same class of voice.
Mademoisele Spezia, who played the frail but lovely Leonora, is an- actress of great energy, and made a considerable sensation hythe details of the dying scene inthelast act. Her voice, most extensivein its register, is not remarkable for flexibility, and her attention has probablybeen directed more to dramatic expression than to the mere effects of vocalization. The spirit with which she interpreted the character completely gained for her the sympathies of the audience, and, though Signor Giuglini was the " lion" of the evening, she had every reason to be satisfied with her reception. The importLnt character of Baldassare was played by a third dZbutant, Signor Vialetti, a basso profondo, endowed with extraordinary power in the lower region of his voice. Signor Bcneventano, the parc nobtc of last year, was an august Alfonso XI.
With respeot to the new danscusel MademoiseUe Caroline Pocchini, who made her first appearance in the baUet ot La Esmeralda, we must at present confine ourselves to the brief statement that her success is unequivocal, and that she dances the immortal Truandaise in a style -which is completely her own, and is, moreover, in the highest degree piqua7n. On a future occasion we may return to the performances of this fascinating young laay, and also to the merits of a certain pas dc cisip, which is intended to make a great stir among the lovers of the choregraphic art.
The following verse was added to the National Anthem, as sung last night, to celebrate the auspicious event of the day-
* May the sweet babe just born,
" like ber thi6 laud aore,
" HoLoue'dw bere seen! " Prea wscoteed In her birth, " Plenty on bouateous eadb,

The Missing Steamship Oneida.
THE MISSING STEAJISHIP ONEIDA.
TO THE EDITOI OF TH1E TIMES.
Sir,-By the late advices from the MtIauritius we hear that the ship ViDa de Bade encountered on the 14th and 15th of February, in lat. 13' S., long. 74' E., a severe hurricane, which commenced at south and ended at west, showing that she must have passed through the N.W. quadrant.
Now, as these storms arise near the west coast of Sumatra, and prog,ess in a W.S.W. direction, at the rate of about 250 miles a-day, it is very probable that the Oneida may have met the ViUe de Basle'& hurricane in about lat. 8'30 S., and long. 92' E., whereslbe would be on the 10th or 11th of February. I do not, therefore, agree with your correspondent " S.," wbo asserts-thatthe Oneida would not cross the track of the hurricanes; but I think with him that there is as yet no cause for poaitive alarm for the safety of a ship so well equipped aed so ably commanded. She may have disabled ber engiusa or I st her masts, and the gear have fouled her scraew, 'h I^i would take a considerable time.to clear, es-ecialkix nsettled weather, and I trust that we sball ere long her et her having safely arrived at the Mdauritius, for wlseh port sbe would most Vrobabty bear up. if cinu msuha!didU t admit of her continuing on the shorto'r, but far uua nmustain, route to her destination, or toh atavsia.

Royal Italian Opera.
I BOYAL 1TAir_A OPERA.
The eleventh season was Uirug. ed ht night with a performance of Bellini's Purlani. CireunrtcUes hioh aliution has already been made forced Mr. Gye, uch to the chagrinof hig patrons, again to have reconrse tothel7cfmw, en attendant the resurrection of the magnifioent theatr-' im Bow-street, to which all the world, or at lea the operStia world, is looking forward rith intene anxiety. The bereave6 impr.aarjo bad no alternative; but that, with his accustomed energy, he is resolved to make the best of his position Was evident at , glance last night. The interior of the theatre has been taxtefuy and handsomely redecorated during the brief interval allowed for operations since the secession of Mr. DillonWs histrionic company; and the official announcement that "the boxes and alls have beell rendered more commodious" is not without warrant.
In fact, there is an air of comfot as well as of eeglaer
abouttheaudiencedepartment, which was inagreatmeasure wanting last season. Other improvements call for notice, not the least significant of which is the new approach to the pit, through the principal entrance in Wellington. street. By means of this judicious arrangement a communication between pit and boxes is established, ana the agreeable intercourse that gives such a charm to the opera, and the want of which was recently so mauch deplored, ceases to be an impossibility. The pit at the Lyceum may now boeregarded as a much less melaucholyplsceof resort. The occupants,nolongerpennedup fortheovening, norcondemned to betake themselves to the open street, as a sort of natura} foyer, between opera and baUet, can both enjoy the music and pAy an occasional visit to their more fortunate acquaintances in the stall and boxes.
The incidents of last night's performance were neither so startling nor so new as to demand a very long desription. but they were satisfactory enough in most respects to authoriz a favourable one. Mr. Costa, on appeasing in tho orchestra, was loudly welcomed. We verily believe that the eminent NeaPolitan-or rather English (for we undertand ke has been n turalized a British subject) conductor would not abandon his post even were the Royal Italian Opera, through farther misadventure, to be temporarily located at the Marionettes, Jis conrshney does honour to him, and the public knows how to appreciate it, of which last night's reception wasan instance. The frst few chords at onoe proclaimed the band the same as that which last season,in spite of its inevitably reduced proportions, enforced the unanimous aelnowledgment of its undiminishe4 excellence. The familiar faces of Sainton, Dando, Mellon, Lucas, Howell, Pratten, Lazarus, the Harpers, Barre, and others, inspired immeraiate confidence; and, while the absence of two performers of the highest rank to whom the habitutei had been aceustomed since 1847 was mar'ked with expressionss of regret, no one doubted that the places of Hill and Baumann, principal viola and baessoon both of whom died last sumnmer), would, under Mr. Costas direc tion, be assigned to competent successors. A word must record that no perceptible difference was remarked in the ehorbs one way or the other. On this subjectk however, we shall have frequent opportunities to enlarge.
And now, what is to be said of rhe Furitani? Shall we describe the music Every note of it is as patent to opera. goers as household words Shall we attempt a digest of the plot? This would be equally superfluous, since, although to explain it with perfect clearness has baffled the skill of the keenest analysers of dramatic fiction, its very obscurity is a hackneyed truisn. A good deal,perhape, might be writte, about Henriette of rance -the intrepid and sagacious wife of Charles " the msty"-who is made to cut so shabby a figure in the librctto of Count Pepoli, but it is too late in the day. The book of the Puritani is a stereotyped absurd. 7ty, destined in All likelihood to be handed down to posterity through the force and enduring beauty of Bellini's melo., dies, and as such let it be respected. Oar readers will Pardon us for a little discursi-eness on consideration of this being the opening night of the opera-an anniversary on which we have been annually accustomed to prepare for their morning perusal something like a column of information and criticism. To talk a column about the Psrten4i, however, would puzzle a musical Mr. Gladstone. The east of the dramatispersonce alone offers occasion for comment.

The last name brings with it a gleam of conrolation. Of Grisi, who has had more " columns" dedicatedto herpraises than any otheroperatifsingerof the last quarter of a century, there is altcays something to say, sinceineverynewperform ance she does at least one or two things that elidt enthusiasn, as genuine and apontaneous as if they had never been done before. And, then, how many assotlations are connected with her reassumpticn of one of her old part ! Who that is old enough can have forgotten those liquid tones, that fluent execution, that enchanting face, that earnest and natural expression which in 1S- first exerted an irresistible spell, and drove all London wild with the sparkling divisions of
Son vergin vezzes, 'In reta dli p"
-or with the sadder and more touching strains of "c Qui isa voce sua soave ?" No one, we are convinced. It is not Possible to witness Grisi's Elvira, even at the present time, without a certain emotion, and this independently of the many tender and exquisite points that still proclaim it an impersonation wholly apart from the common routineHow many things there were last night that called! for unqualified admiration, amid inequalities for which time alone is responsible, those who were present can testify. For example, the me= voce (of which Grisi was always an accomplished mistress) in the theme of the polacca (" son vergin"), which more than compensated for a certain timidity accompanying the execution of the florid variation of the coda; the sotto voce with which the opening of the mad sane (" Qui Ia voce") was delivered; the dramatic ebullition of passion that gave life and reality to Elvira's appeal to Giorgio-
"0 tolieteml la vita
0 rendetemi il mio amor !"
the genuine feeling and rich quality of the middle tones of the voice in the well-known " Vien, diletto"-these and other excelencies deserve to be chronicled as proofs that if Grisi is not the Elvira so many of us can remember, she is still, viewing the part histrionically and vocally as a whole, without a competent successor. The audience received their old favourite last night with their accustomed warmth ; she was twice recalled, and continually applauded, just as if she had never taken leave of the public in 1854. Tant micvx.
As Signor Gardoni and Signor Graziani were both afflicted, more or less, with hoarseness, we need not criticize their performances. In the case of the latter this contretemps necessitated the omission of the obstreperous duet, " Suoni la trouibs," between Giorgio (Signor Tagliafico) and Ricardo, of which Rossini, when writing to a friend at Bologna an account of the production of I Puritani in Paris, said, " The duet for the banses I need not describeyou must have heard it." On the whole, however, in spite of many drawbacks, the opera, as we have hinted, was well performed. The enscnible at least was powerful if the cast of the principal characters might, with some amount of ingenuity, have been mado a trifle stronger; and the audience, seomingly determined to be pleased, were indulgent and encouraging throughout.
The entertainuments terminated with a slight badct dirter tissement, entitled Les AbeiZlers, which, if we are not mistaken, is an excerpt from Hal6vy's opera of Le Juif Errant. A new dancer- Mademoiselle Delechaux-and a very pretty scene by MIr. W. Beverley were the chief incidents of this unpretending trifle.
The next operas are to be 2Yorma and the Troratorcthe last for Grist and Mlario.

DISGRACEyUuL WEDDING.-On Easter Monday a remarkable wedding took place in Bradford parish church. James Tetley, a paucr, well on in years, was married to Betty Stoskdale, wvhos previous husband was killed at BowVIng Ironworks. The parties had lived some time as man. and wife, and the legalization of the marriage was necessary to secure pauper relief. A procession left the neighbourhooca of Sticker lane, where the couple resided, shortly after & o'cloclk, accompanied by thousands on its onward march, the multitude still increasing in density as it passeI down Leeds-road and up VIica-lane to the Old Church. It was led by a man on horseback with white hair, 97 years of age, dzessed in a scarlet cloak, and this patriarch of the cavalcade gave away the willing bride. Two other horsemen. followed, one dressed in a soldier's coat and a sorry hat, with his face painted as red as the coat; and the ether in s bearskin jackce or cape, with hat to match, nd bhis face p2inted like that of a savage New Zealand chief. Then. followed, in a cart, the bride and bridegroom, with an object sitting low between them, resembling, 'in his crouched position, the fgure of " Old Nick," playing the bagpipes in, "Tam O'Shanter." The bride sat calm and meek, seldom, looking round her, but the excited bridegroom ofte gesticen lated violeutly, sliowieg the intended wedding-ring on the lttle finger of his right haud.

[A portion of the following appeared In our second edi. tion of -osterdav:-1
PARIS, ARILs 13, 6 F.ML. I
The Grand Duke Constantine will be here on the 23d. M. de Kisseleff, General Todtleben, and other Russians of the army and navy now in Paris, wiU, as a matter of course, go to Toulon to meet him. Admiral Hamelin, Minister of Marine, and other high functionaries, will, as a matter of courtesy, proceed thither also for the same purpose. The Emperor was anxious to pay him a higher honour still by sending his couisin, Prince Napoleon, to meet the Grand Duke. The Prince was spoken to on the subject, but it appears gave a formal refusaL The conversation appears to have been rather animated at one moment, the Emperor making use of every argument and putting forth all his powers of persuasion to convince his cousin and induce him to consent; but as yet in vain. His Imperial Highness, whose repugnance to a Russian alliance, or anything approaching it, is very strong, remained and remains unmoved; he declared his readiness to absent himself from Paris, if necessary, while the Grand Duke was here. Whether he will yet change his mind it is hard to say, but to this moment he has not done so.
General Todtleben is of course rather f9ted among official people. He remained with the Emperor nearlv an hour at his frst audience. The Emperor asked him whether, if the French and English had marched on Sebastopol at once after the battle of the Alma, they could have taken it ? General Todtleben declared that there was no doubt about it, as there were but two or three battalions in the place. This opinion was subsequently expressed by himto others.
The Ministerial paper, the Pays, says that advices from the Persian Gulf state that the armistice concluded between Persia and England was announced on the 9th of March to the General commanding the English expedition to Bushire, and that the convention relative to the suspension of arms had been signed anterior to the treaty of peace between the two nations, and when the bases of that treaty were agreed to.
A letter from Vienna of the 10th announces that telegraphic despatches had been just received from the Danubian Provinces, stating that the Auition, a despatch boat of the Sardinia navy, had arrived on the 7th at Ismail from Constantinople, having on board the Sardinian Commissioner, the Chevalier Benzi.
The Pays mentions that the Bourrasque, the Couleuvrine, and the Rafale gunboats, lately fitted up, are destined for the Senegal station.
A Madrid newspaper, the leading organ of the Liberal party, was lately prosecuted for an article which it published on the voting lists on the occasion of the late elections in Spain. The Iberia (the 5ournal in question) was defended by M. Olozaga, (late Ambassador from the Queen of Spain to the Court of the Tuileries,) who may be justly regarded as the Erskine of the Spanish bar. The trial came on on the 7th, and excited greater interest with tho Madrid public than any similar event for some time past. To the eloquence and skill of the advocate it is indebted for the signal triumph it has obtained in its complete acquittaL In the course of his speech M. Olozaga alluded in these words to the efforts made to establish a representative government in his country:-
" We desire-and I speak in the name of my political frionds of the Iberia, and of the whole liberal press," said the orator,-" we desire to see representative government In all its force and in all its truth. We have indood passed through many unhappy circumstances; but in the conduct we have pursued he who would say that misfortune and suffering have turned us aside from that cause, or disgusted us with it, would be greatly in error. The husband. man who sees his fields laid wasto by the tempest, desolated by storms of hail, or parched up by the heat, accepts the visitations of Heaven, and, with pious resignation, says to himself, 'My sins, perhaps, have brought on me these disasters.' But the patience he shows under suffering does not affect hisphilosophicand Christian couwage; and withrenewed energy he returns to his labours, though with the conviction that the produce of that year is lo3t to him. We, gentlemen, are those resigned husbandmen; and we believe that, whether we have or have not contribu ted ourselves to our disappointments and our reverses, we become not only worthy of a better fate by our resignation, our perseverance, and oar firmness for the future, but we render an essential service to our co untry by combining together all the meaus 'vhich the law places at our disposal to constitute a legitl-nate electoral body, of which our Parliaments are to be the issue, and by so enlightening public opinion that future Cortes shall be the genuinie expression of the will, the wishes, and the necessities of the Spanish people.
"Gentlemen, representative government is a magnif. cent compromise between ancient institutions and modern requirements. It is useful to the people in their social and political progres, in elevating their dignity, in improving their education, in securing their welfare, and in teaching them the difficult science of self-government. To tho Throne it is indispensable, as a safeguard against revolutionary slhocks, and even against those other dangers which are less violent and less apparent, but more to be dreaded, and to which it is exposed by cer tain tendencies it may not be able to resist openly, but which merit careful attention, as the complications they involve would affect all Europe if prudence did not conciliat
the conflicting interests and opinions which divide it. Representative government, moreover, enables the Thro-ne to dis. embarrass itself of its treacherous friends; of men whose only ambition is wealth; of inen who impoverish it; of men who corrupt because they adulate it, and of those who are at the same time ambitious and cowardly ; of those creatures who first bring danger around it, and then basely abandon it in the hour of peril ! Such is the system of government that some persons are now pleased to calumniate, but which wec defend with all the force the law gives us; and which, confident in the purity and excellence of our doctrines, we shall continue to defend with porseverance and courage; and to obtain the triumph of such a cause we will employ aU the legal means that are still left us, whatEver be the attempts to cheat us of them."
The Bishop of Nancy, principal Almoner to the Emperor, has returned from Rome, and has brought with him a Papal BuU for the better organization of the Tmperial Almonry. Hitherto the household and all persons conneeted with the Imperial Palaces belonged to the parish or diocess in which the Court happened to be situate. For instance, the household of theTuileries, including theEmperor himself, were considered as parishioners of St. Germain de l'Auxerrois. This was felt to be inconvenient where points of jurisdiction and discipline -were concerned, and might lead, I will not say to any very violent dissension, but to differences which, even among bishops and canons, do not tend to the increase of charitv. The Emperor has a decided repugnance to discord among chuirchmen, it is so difficult, he thinks, to deal with them; and the Bishop of Nancy was requested to settle the affair at llome. According to the present arrangement the Imperial household, and all who in any way depend on the various Palaces where the Court may reside, will be considered as under the authoiity of the Almonry; they will, in fact, form a sort of speeial diocess, which the Bishop as Grand Almoner will administer. The bull has not yet been made public as accepted and authorized by the head of the State. It is suspected there may be in it some phrase of too ultramontane a character to suit the tastes of those who stand out forthe liberties and franchises of the Gallican Church, Whether anything passed between the Pope and the Bishop about the coronation I am not aware. On. the whole,
he has returned, according to all reports, well satisfied with his reception by the Holy Father.
It is expected that the difference which exists between the Turkish and Persian Governments relative to their boundaries will be amicably arranged, the Persian Ambassador having proposed to refer it for arbitration to the Emperor of the French.

Trade was dull last week in Paris, both among the mannfacturers and shopkeepers. The approach of Easter induced some purchases in the fancy shops, but business, unfortunately, is not so active as might be expected at this season of the year. Neither are the orders received by the manufacturers in the departments as numerous as could be wished. Tho manufacturers are still obliaged to make concessions in order to effect sales, The difficulty of obtaining discount is one reason for the
dullness of trade. It was hoped that the Bank of 'rance would reduce its rate of discount to 5i per cent. at the begiring of this month, but the higher rateo-of interest in London prevents it. The x¶aiufacturers of Rouen ar, among those who compIain most of the present state of trade. The high price of the raw material used by them prevents them disposing of their goods at remunerating prices. The tendency to a decline in the corn-markets throughout France be. comes more decided, according as the season adlvances, and the favourable appearance of the growing crops can be better appreciated. ThQ holders of large stooks of wheat appear to have re. solved to bring them to market, and to ascertain their losses, after having for months indulged the hope of high prices. The farmers likewise are beginuing to follow their example, fearing, no doubt that an abundant harvest will reduce prices-sti
lower. Wheat fell again at the last Paris marke If. the sack of 240lb. of the beat qualit, If. 50c. the sack of second quality, and 2f. 60c. th1
sack of third quality. Throughout the departinents the fall is genera], averaging 2f. the hectolitre. Flour has fallen in Paris lf. the sack of 157 kilo+ grammes, and there is a great difficulty in making sales even at that reduction. The country market4 are generally well supplied, although the spring work in many places prevents the farmers from bringingforward their stocks of corn. Wheat ii again beginning to arrive at Marseilles. Thi arrivals last week amounted to 100,000 hectoliti%i of wheat, and 14,000 hectoitres of Indian corn, The price of raw silk is maintained in the de ah ments of the Drbme and the Ardkche, withoul much business doing in those markets ; but,' as thi stock of silk in the hands of the manufacturers
Lyons and St. Etienne is nearly exhausted, a further rise is expected, particularly as there are stiU reports current of a disease among the silkworms. The high' price of sugar in Paris is weR maintained, but withE out any further progress. Home-made sugar ham risen slightly at Lille. Letters from Nantes statO the prices of sugar at 69f. 50c. for West Indian, 70Ef forBourbon, and Sf.for Mauritius. Thewine-market at Bercy remains unchanged, without much business doing, the consumers taking as little a s possible,- in consequenlce of the high prices, and- the appearance of the vineyards giving ho~pes of a most abundant vintage. The weather which prevails at present in the south is most favourable to the vines. The price. of spirits distiled from beetroot in Paris is quoted as 124f. the heetolitre. At Bordeaux the " 3-6" is quoted at 21F.f. the hectolitre.

A letter dated from the Abruz2i, in the kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the 22d of March, says that it would be impossible to give a true idea of the rgime which prevails in those provinces, or of the suiferings endured by the inhabitants. Their liberties and lives are at the mercy of the commonest informer. A corporal of gendarmerie isaspowerful as the King, and a judge of the third class is above the law. The writer of the letter mentions the follow"iii
fact in corroboration of his statement ;-Monsignor Belgrado, Bishop of the diocess of Ascoli, In the Roman States, has within his jurisdiction a portion of the province of Aquila, in the kingdom of Naples. From time to time he makes a pastoral viitinto that portion of his diooess. Some time sine the Bishop, who was formerly Papal nuncio at the Hague, and who naturally receives the foreign journals, was visited by a young man at Civitaducale, who found in one of those foreign journals a strong article in disapprobation of the King of Naples' system of government. The young man was so imprudent as to mention this fact. He was immediately arrested and cast into prison. After much suffering he was released, but on condition that he should not quit the town of Civitaducale. This restraint is still imposed on him, notwithstanding the intercession of Monsignor Belgrado, but a bishop is powerless against a police officer. Thus the most innocent action is converted into a crime, and the most trifling expression may entail on the utterer the most violent persecution.
A letter from Palermo of the 31st, in the Opini oe of Turin, announces the execution of Spinuzza, one of the insurgents engaged in the late outbreak. "Pursuant to the sentence," the correspondent writes,-
"H He was shot at Cefalu before his own house, his famnily having previously been sent out of the town In order to spare them the sorrow of witnessing the tragedy. Before his executiorn Spinuzza was taken to a church opposite his house, where he confessed his sins, obtained absolution, received the sacrament, and heard mass. Durlng the whole ceremony the sacristan, who had known him from his boybood, wept bitterly. Spinuzza, before leaving, begged to be allowed to embrace him, which was granted; but the sacristan fainted in his arms. Spinuzza supported him, and took him to a seat; and, notwithstanding the opposition of the officers, took off his own cloak and covered him with it. He was then led out of the church, seated in a chair, and blindfolded. Before receiving the fatal shot he exclaimed, 'Liberty for ever 1' the sgnal was then given, and he expired without a struggle."

VIENNA, AmrL 11.
A few days ago the Ost-DeutschePost and the Oesterreichische Zeitung affirmed that the concentration of 20,000 Sardinians in a camp near Alessandria would not lead to any counter demonstration on the part of Austria, and a similar assurance was given to me by a person who is generally well informed of the intentions of this Government. It is, however, possible that both the above-mentioned papers and myself were misinformed, for it is now stated that
uount (iyulal, the commander of the Austrian army in Italy, has received instructions to form a
"ceamp of instruction" between Sesto Calende and Somma, which places are at the southern extremity of the Lago Maggiore. If this report, which circulates in military circles, should prove to be correct, Austria will have placed herself in a most unpleasant position, for authentic in. formation was yesterday received from Turin that the idea of pitching a camp at Alessandria had been relinquished. Unfortunately for her dignity and reputation, Austria permits the world to see that she is jealous of the increasing influence of Sardinia in Italy, and the measures which she
tokes against that State arc such that they are invariably disapproved by the other Powers. It is stated by a Brussels paper that one of the complaints made by this Government against the Sardinian Cabinet is that the latster has declared its intention to complete the fortifications of Alessandra, but it is somewhat difficult to believe that the statement is correct. During the last year Austria has greatly strengthened her position at Piacenza, and it would therefore be the height of injustice if she should object to the Sardinians fortifying the only fortress which they have between the Austrian frontier and Turin.
The Timpul (the Times), which is the organ of the Union party of Bucharest, publishes the following programme-
' L Guarantee of the autonomy of the Rouman nation and of the international rights based on the 'eapitullationa' (treatries) which were concluded between the Rounman
countries and the S ertbi o Poswfer in the years 1393, 14sy, and 113; neutrality of the M2oldo-Wallachian territory.
" 2. The fornation of oMai,od and Wallachia intol one siDgle State, underone aingle Government.
*3. A foreign hereditary Prince to be chosen from one of the reigning European families; his heirs to be brought up in the religion of the country.*
"4. A representative Government, with one sing'e Assembly, according to ancient custom. ' This Assembly t be so formed that all the different classes of society shall ba represented in it.
" These are the bases on which, in our opinion, it woal I be possible to effect the political organization of the two PrIncipalities. The internal reforms could be earrie4 ohab by the Representative Assemibly, which would meet'as sooaM as the future constitution of the two countrios had been introduced. Oar political confession of faith is eypresse&ie. the following sentences:-
"1. Xespect of property, oftrhatever kind itan`ayb'el. "2. Equality of all RIumans in the eye of the law.
"3. Personal and individual freedom, and free labout for the peasnts."
The foregoing recalls - to. ny raemory the. wsihes expressed by the Viennese Radicals in May, 1848. Those " go-a-head" politicians rejected with. disdain the constitution granted by the Emperor Ferdinand, because it stipulated that there should be two Cbambers,- The institutions of England were declared to be old-fashioned, and the Senate of the United State3 was denounced as a "ssuperfluous luxury." The Agram Zeifung states that bL Luca Radovitch, who was abo-dt 'a month ago carried off by the Montenegrins from the Austriau territory near Cattaro, has been put to death in his prison at Cettinye, but the news does not obtain credit here. A. Luca Radovitch is an Austrian subject, but the demand of the Inperial Government for his liberation has been much less peremptory than it would have been had it not been suspected that he was a Russian agent. On the 7th the firm of Euechnich at Trieste suspended pavnent; and the circumstance has created consi-derable sensation. The head of the house, who died about a year and a-half ago, was considered a Very wealthy man, as he gave his youngest daughter a dowry of 10,0001. when she married Prince Daniel of Montenegro.
Things cannot be going on smoothly at Venice, for the TIriesrZeiughaslearnedthat Count Correr, the Podeata of the city, has tendered his resignation to Count Bissingen, the Stadtholder of the province. The probability is that the resignation of M. de Correr will be accepted, as Count Bissingen has recommended to the Governor-General three members of the municipal council as fitting persons for the office of Podesta, or Mayor. The Emperor will nominate the person proposed by his brother, the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian. In official circles it is stated that 400,000 forims (40,0001.) per annum have been placed at the disposal of the (iovernor-General of the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom, but the sum is too smalL The Archduke Regnier, the late Viceroy, had 500,000 florins, but it was hardly enough to defray the expenses of the Viceregal Court, although the necessaries of life were at least 25 per cent. cheaper then than they are at present. The Patriareh of Venice, who was between 80 and 90 years of age, died at 11 o'clock in the morning of Thursday, the 9thinBt. Agreatmany lodgings have been taken for English and French families at Venice, and it is as well that such is the case, for there is as great a stagnation in the trade of the city as there is in the waters which surround it. On the 2d the Archduke Maximilian of AustrianEste left Modena, where he had gone to visit his sick nephew. The health of the Duke of Modena is so much better that he is again able to perform his official duties.
The Cardinal-Archbishop of Vienna andhis Jesuit partisans are said to be intriguing against some of the employes of the Ministries of Justice and Public Instruction who are suspected of being averso to the ceaseless encroachments of Rome on the sovereign rights of the Emperor, and it is probable enough that the report is well founded. The Roman hierarchy " terrorizes"' the lay enmp1oyEs, and it is my firm belief that very many of them act contrary to the dictates of their consciences in order to avoid giving ofence to a body which indirectly rules the State. At the end of March CardinalAltiers who was formerly Papal Nuncio here, consecrated the new Bishop of Crema (Lombardy) at Rome. In a speech which he made on the occasion his Eminence observed that it was for him a most agreeable task to oonscorato the eubject of an umperor " wsv ad made the important interests of the Church his own." Cardinal Haulik, who was present, replied, "that the clergy owed their regeneration to the Concordat, the Imperial author of which was the pride of the Church."
According to St. Petersburg letters the administration of Poland is likely to be entirely separated from that of Russia. It is also stated that directly after his marriage the Grand Duke Michael will be appointed Stadtholder of the kingdom of Poland. The Guiide to Natiomsl Ecowwrny, a new Russian paper, which attacks the Customs system violently, advocates free trade, at the same time that it points out the faults of the Administration and denounces the Infamous venality of the empl es.
ERiza Pasha, the newly-appoited Turkish Minister to the Court of St. Petersburg, is prepar
for his departure. As soon as the British fleet had quitted the Dardanelles orders were given by the Porte to the governor of the castle not to permit any vessels to enter the Straits by night. O)n the 3d inSt. the British squadron under Admiral Lyons entered the port of Smnyrna.

BERIIN, APRIL 12.
The further news that we have received from Copenhagen is still very scanty, consisting only of those scraps of intelligence that telegraphic correspondence peculiarly afl'ects. According to a despatch from the Danish capital of Friday evening, the King had not as yet accepted the tendered Ministerial resignations, and, according to another, dated the same evening at half-past 6 o'clock, His Majesty had accepted them; where the information is bothcontradictory and brief there is no help for it but patience. Unfortunately, the trial of patience may last many days yet, for in Copenhagen, as well as here on the continent, the press evinces its deep religious feelings by abstaining from publication on all the holydays that were ever observed by any church in any century; a decorous practice which, as it involves a great saving of paper and print, while the payment of the subscribers remains undiminished, brings with it its own reward. The Privy Council was to meet on Saturday at Christiansborg (the King's Palace in Copenhagen), under the presidency of His Majesty, when it was believed that the weighty questions with regard to the future Ministry and its policy would be decided.
Here politics are enjoying their Easter holydays: the Ministers and most of the deputies have left town; the former to recruit themselves from the labours of the late arduous debates and to steel themselves against a defeat which awaits them on the resumption of business by th'e ouse of Notables. According to the report of a committee of that Rouse, the magnates of the land
are recommended to reject the proposed biUl for raising the price of salt, which is a monopoly of the State, and there is very little doubt that they wil comply with the recommendation. The House of Deputies has already rejected the other proposed bill, for laying a tax upon all houses and tenements; and so the Exchequer, which has been suffering from deficient supplies for many years past, stands a fair chance of being driven to resort to sensible views of taxation; but this last resource will not be adopted for a few years more, until the weaknes i or fa-inness of the country has shown itself still more unmiastakeably than in the explanations that ! Ministers have been obliged lately to give in the
Chambers. In public life in Prussia no measure, however good, is good enough to justify to the taxpayers a fresh tax or an enlarged outlay; even the j redemption of the Sound Dues, that tourniquet oa
the Baltic artery of Prussian trade, met with cavilers on the Right side of the House of Deputies; and in private life the Prussians are so fearful of becoming extravagant that they won't even go to the expense of asldng the price of any article.
jPrince Alfred, who is still at rGeneva, is expected at the beginning of May to arrive at Gotha, where he will reside for a short time at Schloss Rosenau. At the conclusion of this visit to the territories of which the young Prince will probably one day be X the reigning monarch, he will repair to the University at Bonn, and pass some few terms there. For the Prince of Wales there has also been taken a convenient and agreeable dwelling in the immediate vicinity of the University town, where - he will shortly come to reside,

The annual grand Swiss rifle match will be held this year at Berne, and a circular, which actual circumstances render important, has been addressed by 'the central committee to the various rifle associations. A passage of the circular says:-
* "The weapon which for many years has been an object of amusemeut in days of peace has Teconquered the rank it occupied in former times, for the man who is properly armed is a freetnan."
The document terminates-in the following man ner:-
" Let aU of you, dear Confederates, take part. in the coming solemnity. Doubtless, you will bring with you conflicting political ideas, but you will be all made welcome. The citizen anxious for peace, who, in order to attain with certainty his aim, is inclined to yield a portion of his rights, will not receivo a less hearty welcome than the brave patriot who will notconsent to a peace becauseit has been purchased by concessions and not achieved bywar. Allthese dissonances willbebarmonizedbymeansofoneabsorbing idea-that Neuchbitel is and must remain exclusively Swiss.

'A LEXANDR]iA Anr'i 4.i
The Londonx mails of the 26th ult. reached Alexandria this morning by the Peninsular'and Oriental Company's steamers Pera and Euiine, from: Southampton and M"areifles, and afr expected to'proceed from Suez on tl e 7th inst.' by -t1 Alma and Ganges, which arrived froiu Caicutta and Bomba on.the 30th ult. and 2d inst.
The administration.of the transit department has lately received some modification by the appointment- of a comaittee cf directors, composMd of three Europeans and three Turks. Of the former, one is Mongel Bey, a Frenchman, and chief engineer to- the Egyptian Government, and the other two are merchants, one of whom is an Englishman, the chief of a firm that has for many years been established in this country. What the function of the committee will be does rot yet precisely appear, but it seems likely that its appointment is more immediately in connexion with tlie conduct of xailway affirs, which, togetEer with the introduction of the electric telegraph, have of late years added considerably to the business and duties of the transit department, now officially termed "T.ransit and Railway Administration." The railway between Alexandria and Suez is that of paramount importance, but it must be remembered that this line is not the only one in course of construction. In this, as in other thingAs the first' stop has led to another, and thus the railway from Alexandria to Cairo, called into existence by the transit, lIa led to the commencement of a line branchina off from Zaute, in the centre of the Delta, to Lunianond, on the Danietta branch of the Nile, which it is not improbable will ultimately be prolonged to the cotton districts beyond. Another line has for ome time likewise been in course of construction, running from Alexandria along the northern banks of Lake Mareotis to a distance of about 18 miles, where a permanent encampment is to be established for troops, and this line may also be cited, though without entering into the question as to the policy of the expenditure, as adding to the prospect of a regular system of railway communication being gradually established in this country. The Egyptian railways must, however, always be in close comnexion with the transit, and the arrangements attending them in some degree subordinate to that department; but the question now arises whether the general direction will be best carried on by one efficient man at the head of the administration, armed with sufficient powers and with a well-selected staff of officers under him, or by a board composed of several members; and it must be admitted that those best acquainted with this country will generally pronounce for the former plan.
In connexion with the Mareotis Railway we have lately had to deplore an accident by which several lives have been lost. A locomotive was propelling a long train of heavil laden trucks, and owing to the absence of the usual signal fag, which indicated the spot where the train should be stopped, the driver overshot the mark; two or three trucks ran beyond the extremity of the line of rails, and, falling among a number of workmen, caused the death of nine, besides wounding about the same number.
A project has lately been brought forward for the establishment of a new bank. The promoters of the scheme are chiefly Greeks, and it appears likely to receive the support of the principal merchants of that nation, who, as is well known, possess a large share of the business of Alexandria. The operations of the contemplated establishment, it agpears, will be conducted on the principle of the od local banks, which combine brokerage with banldng transactions, and, indeed, rather render the latter subservient for the extension of their business as brokers. The Bank of Egypt, meanwhile, has been successful in the competition for one of our principal financial operations-namely, the remitting to London of the Egyptian tribute, which, as your readers are aware, is appropriated for the payment of the interest on the Turkish loan. The amount is 283,0001., to be remitted in instalments of about 15,0001. by each Indian mail payments one month after the delivery of each set of bills. The tender made by the Bank of Egypt was 96 39-40th tariff piastres per pound which, at the present value of sovereigns in the orcinary commercial currency, is equal to an exchange of about 1001 to 101 piastres for three months' bills.
The new chart of the harbour of Alexandria, showing the position of the buoys and beacons with which the entrance to the ort has been marked off under the direction of M. Hommey, lieutenant de vaisseau in the French navy, has finally been re* ceived in Egypt, and the Government has distributed a large number among the various European consulates. The sailing instruciions are printed on the charts, but these had already been published by the British Consulate, who received them from the Hydrographic-office, framed from a report made by Captain Monsell of Her Majesty's ship Tartarus.
The Viceroy has been at Alexandria for some days past, but intends passing the approaching month of Ramadan at Mariout.
Business has been very quiet during the past fortnight, and quotations for grain and pulse, owing to the scarcity of supplies, are almost quite nominal. Contracts for future delivery have also been neglected, but prices are maintained. Of cotton we have now considerable stocks, and there has been some decline in the price of lower descriptions, the quantity of which greatly preponderates. Shipments of the staple during the past five months amount to 47,200 bales against 62,900 bales during the same period last year; and of that quantity 30,200 bales have gone to England against 37,400 bales last year.
Exchange on London at three months' date 102& piastres per pound for first-cla ss aper. Marseilles, 4f 98e. per dollar of 20 piastres. Freighta are very duUl, and quotations quite nominaL.
THE ARMY IN INDIA.-If the augmentation of
THE ARMY IN INDIA.-lf the augmentation of our army be delayed the safety of our empire is, we believe, compromised. Oar forces in this country are on a peace establishment, and we are not able to detach 20,000 men for service in foreign parts, with any degree of safety or propriety. The extent to which this presidency is denuded of troops is hardly credible. We may mention that in Bombay itself so small is tho garrison that the aconstomed guards at the pay-offmce and the residences of the Members of Council have had to be withdrawn, At Ahmedabad the police aro doing garrison duty-while in Poonah, the headquarters of the Nlahratta country, we have less than 1,000 men of al arms ia place of 5,000, the usual and safe complement. We have never been contributors to alarm in this country, but we confess that there is dangerpressing danger-in this sudden withdrawal of the troops, absolutely necessary for our safety even in times of peace. Again, our army is altogether under-officered for the exigencies of war. At the present moment we can point to regiment after regiment with but three or foar European officers doing duty with them. The 15th Regiment of Native Infantry, now in garrison, has but three European officers with it; the 29tb, in Belraum, a like number; and there are a few regiments with half-a-dozen Europeans resent. There is temerity as welU as timidity to be avoioed, and if this war, to which we are committed, is to last, the army must bo augmiented, and the proportion of European officers increased. Neither the one ieasure nor the other can bh safely delayed any longer.-Inidian Papcr.

GBRA7`BXHIBITIOjY OF A RY VREASURES.
(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDEN.)
MANCHESTER, AI'RIL L3.
'the collection of aucient pictures, whiclh is very large and valuable, will be exhibited in the south gallery. Ithasbeenplacedunderthe charge of-Mir. Sehaxf, jun., who has adopted a s3mewhit novel
lan in its arrangoment. He has proceeded upon the broad principle of devoting one entire wall to the works of the Italian and Spanislh in.aters, and the other to the productions of Germany. Flanderi, England, and all countrie3 foreignato Spain and Italy. But that is not all. The picttres on both .ides of the gallery are arranged in chronological order, so that the works of each master of Italy or Spain are placed opposite those of a painter belonging to some other country who lived in the same period. Angelico da Fiesole, for example, is opposed to John Van Eyck, Rubens to Guido, and Vandyke to AVelasquez. The lesser divisions of schools, which are those of Tuscany, Siena, Naples, UImbria, Cologne, Flanders, Saxony, and Nuremberg are marked by being kept in distinct groups, ald arranged for the most part in parallel lines one over the other. With a few exceptions, which will presently be specified, the pictures exhibited are those of masters who flourished between the years 1400 and 1700, a period of three centuries. The latest painting in the gallery almost corresponds in point of date with the commencement of the modem Engliszl school, and consequently no place is given here to the productions of Hudson, Hogarth, Thornhill, Richardson, or any of the English masters who lived at the beginning of the 18th century.
The gallery is divided into three main halls, the first, next the transept, being devoted to the earlier period of art. The centre of the end wall is occupied by a picture which created some sensation in the Royal Academy two years ago, and which is now the property of the Queen. It is the work of Leighton, and represents the triumphal procession in which Cimabue's picture of the Madonna was carried through the streets of Florence. On either side of it are displayed specimens of Italian art, from the classic fresco paintings of the Baths of Titus and the Catacombs down through the feeble attempts of Cimabue and the bold and inventive pieces of Giotto to the productions of the 14th century and the dawn of art in Germany and Flanders. Mr. Scharf commences his series of German, Flemish, and English pictures with the works of Van Eyck, which are followed by many fine specimens of Grunewald, IMabuse, Matsys, Rubens, Vandyke, Holbein, Rembrandt, and other well-known masters, closing at the end of the third or last hall with paintings belonging to the latter part of the 17th century. The contributions of Prince Albert to this branch of the exhibition are very extensive and important, for his Royal Highness possesses an almost unbroken series of examples of early German art. The illustrations of Italian and Spanish art commence with the works of Angelico da Fiesole, and include a great number of pieces by Botticelli, Perugino, Raphael, Michael Aigelo, Titian, Paul Veronese, Velasquez, Marillo, and other eminent masters, ending, like the pictures on the opposite side, with the year 1700. The magnificent equestrian portrait of Charles I., from Windsor Castle, by Vandyke, occupies a position at the bottom of the gallery corresponding to that of Leighton's picture at the top.
It would be impossible to convey any adequate idea of the great value and beauty of the Italian and Spanish collection. Such a display of masterpieces has probably never before been witnessed in England, and it convincingly proves the statement of Dr. Waagen that we possess art treasures far surpassing those of any other country. The series begins with a head of Christ by Angelico da Fiesole, which originally formed part of a fresco representing the crucifixion. Fiesole is represented by another picture-the "Entombment of the Virgin"-which was formerly called a Giotto, and as such was engraved by D'Agincourt. His works are followed by specimens of Sandro Botticelli, with his wildness of form and pedantic display of Greek learning. Perugino, the master of Raphael. is present in five predella pictures, contributed by Mr. Barker, and in a superb altar piece-the Virgin and Child enthroned, with St. Jerome and St. Peter on either side-exhibited by Lord Northwick. One of the earliest specimens of Raphael is the " Crucifixion," taken from Citta di Castello, painted in 1500. Mr. Fuller Maitland contributes the " agony in the Garden," mentioned by Vasari in his Lives of Painters. Two celebrated Madonnas are furnished by Lord Cowper; Miss Burdett Coutts exhibits the "Madonna andChild," which was formerlyin the collection of MIr. Samuel Rogers, together with another picture representing the "Agony in the Garden ;" and Lord Warwick sends a duplicate of the " Joanna of Aragon" in the Louvre. Near the
works of Raphael is placed a "Holy Family"-I II Reposa-by Barto omeo, the finest specimen | of that master in England. Of Michael Angelo we have the picture representing "Christ and the Woman of Samaria," which was formerly in the collection of Ottley, and a "HolyFamily," unfinished, belonging to Mr. Labouchere. Michael Angelo is followed by specimens of the early Venetian achool, represented byAndrea Bellini and others, and by the works of Francia, the friend and correspondent of Raphael. Further on the glories of Venice present themselves to view, Titian, Tintoretto, Paul Veronese, and their contemporaries. The " Europa" of Titian has been exhibited by Lord Darnley, and here also is his original sketch of the celebrated " Gloria," or apotheosis of Charles V., still in Spain. The "N ine Muses," by Tintoretto, has been lent from Hampton Court, and there are no fewer than five large allegorical subjects by Paul Veronese. The Bolognese school is represented by Caracci and others. A splendid " St. Agnes," by Domenichino, has been obtained from Windsor Castle. Velasquez and the Spanish masters are also well represented. The portraits of Velasquez are hung exactly opposite those by Vandyke, so that the productions of the two great masters of portrait painting may be studied together, an advantage for which the vistors ought to be thankful to Mr. Scharf. The Duke of Bedford, Mr. Farrer, and Mr. Hoskins have contributed some fine specimens of Velasquez. Several magnificent Murillos have been furnished by Sir CuUing Eardley, the Rev. Thomas Stanniforth, and Mr aicdiam Sterling. Among the specimens of the academic and decorative style of painting may be mentioned some frescos taken from a palace at Milan. They represent the contest between the Centaurs and the Lapithie, were painted by Gambara, and have been contributed to the exhibition by Prince Albert. Below Murillo are some of the later masters,-the naturalists, as they are called -of Italy; and the serles closes with some vigorous pieces by Salvator Rosa.
The collection of pictures belonging to Germany, Flanders, England, and other countries foreign to IWy and Spain is very extensive, and embraces Xhqome splendid specimens of art. It begins with an
old cepy of a famous altarpiece, representing the "Adoration of the Lamb," by Hubert and John Van
Eyck, formerly in the chapel of the town-hall I at Ghent. The curious Orford picture, by Grunewald, now the property of Prince Albert, is a striking feature in the collection; but, admirable as
is, it must yield the palm to the celebrated
M'aouse, representing the "Adoration of the Kings," from Castle Howard-a picture formidable to the pre-Raphaelites on account of its exquisite finish and its selection of the more refined objects in nature. Flanking the Mabuse are two fine pictures from Hampton Court, representing James IV. of Scotland and his Queen. Lower down the gaLery is the "Misers," by Quentin Matays. Rubens is represented by several of his most splendid productions. The Queen has contributed his " St. Martin dividing his cloak with a Beggar"; and Mr. Mathew Wyatt exhibits the magnificent picture of " Juno setting the Eyes of Argus in a Peacock's TaiL" Here also is Tomyris ordering the head of Cyrus to be bathed in human blood, and among a number of other pictures are portraits of himself, his wife, and the Bishop of Antwerp. Several excellent specimens of Snyders have been contributed by the Duke of Newcasdle, the Earl of Derby, and Sir Philip Egerton. They consist for the most part of marketpieces with fish, frait, and flowers, but there are also one or two boar and wolf hunts. Of Poussin there are some admirable specimens from the galleries of the Earl of Carlisle, the Earl of Yarborough, and Mr. Mox. In addition to the 'Triumph of Bacchus" and a " Holy Family" there is a small repetiton recently found in Dorsetshire of a pictnre called the " Testament of Eudamiidas,"* *by Poussin, which, after being engraved with great care in France, was brought to England and lost. The Vandykes form, in number and value;
annimportant part of the collection. One of his finest partraits is that of Snyders, the painter, contributed by the Earl of Carlisle: The -companion portrait-that of Snyders' wife-is exhibited by Lord Warwick. It is said that the grandfather of the present Lord WVarwick proposed to the then Earl of Carlisle that they should toss for the possession of the two pictures. WVhether the latter nobleman was willing to entertain the proposition is not related, but it was never carried out, and " Snyders and his wife" were doomed to remain separate for some time longer. They are now reunited for a time at Manchester. Her Majesty has contributed several Vandykes-among others the splendid equestrian portrait of Charles I., already noticed. The " Children of Charles I." have likewise been obtained from the Long Room in Windsor Castle. Lord de Grey is also an important contributor of Vandykes. One, a superb picture, represents three chiNlren (names unknown) standing on the steps of a portico; painted by Vandvke in the style of his Genoese period. The " St. Jerome," wvith the angel holding a pen-L'A/nge a la 'plume, as it is called in France-frome the collection of l.ucien Buonaparte, has been contributed by Mr. Lucy, of Charlcote-park. The works of Vandyke are followed by those of Sir Anthony More and other foreign artists vvho visited England in the 17th century. We then come to specimens of the Dutch school, in which the collection is particularly rich. George IV. was a great admirer of Dutch artists, and made a large collection of their works, of which a considerable number have been c ontributed to the exhibition by the Queen. Mr. Thomas B3aring, Mr. Henry HIope, and Miss Berdel hlave furnished numerous specimens of Rembrandt,
Vanderveldt, De goning, Jan Steen, Teniers, and* other Dutch masters. One of the most striking paictures at the close of the series is a portrait of Peter the Great, by Sir Godfrey EKneller.
Such are a few of the more prominent pictures in the ancient gallery. Many most interesting. specimens have necessarily been omitted. We have. niot mentioned, for example, a fragment of a curious fresco representing the "Fall of the Angels," by Spinello Aretino. It belongs to Mr. Layard, who rescued it from destruction somue time ago in Italy. Vasari relates that the devil was Painted so hideously uglythat he appeared to A retiuo in his sleep and demanded the reason of such uncivil treatment. The answer of Aretino is not recorded, but the story runs that the interview made such an impression upon his mind that he fell into a melancholy which lasted the rest of his life. Perhaps it is improper to add that the provoking researches of modern critics-Lord Lindsay and others -have proved that Aretino lived far beyond the period stated by Vasari, and that he painted some of his best works after his alleged colloquy with the Prince of Darkness. The figure of His MIajesty, unfortunately, is not in the fragment contributed by Mr. Layard to the exhibition.
One of the objects aimned at by Mr. Soharf in the formation of the gallery has been to reunite, as far as possible, the scattered fragmnents of the Orleans, the Solly, and the Rogers collections. HIe has 5ucceeded in doing so to a great extent, and the visitor will have an opportunity of viewing, re-collected in these galleries, collections which'aernwe throughout the world. rnwe
The Borough Of Kidderminster And Its Election Riots.
THE BOROUGH OF KIDDERMINSTER AND ITS
E3LECTION RIOTS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-The public press continues its indignant comments on the recent "stoning" of the Vice-President of the Board of Trade and the principal and most inteligent of the
citizens of Eidderminster. The outrage did not surprise| me (and it was not perpetrated chiefly by inhabitants of the borough, but by " foreigners," introduced as usual from the neighbouring districts, who enjoy a wake or occasion of row), nor wil it astonish you or your readers when you read the singular and remarkable facts in this letter. I am a Worcestershire man, and, I am sorryto confess, an octogenarian, having been upwards of half a century thoroughly acquainted, as your readers vnil perceive, with the " ins" and " outs' of the borough. My facts aud retrospective review wiUl cast some light on the transaction.
Kidderminster anciently sent members to Parliament (Willis, in the.Yotitid Parliamentaria), and, by the writs of the Record Commaissioners' publication, sent two members to Parliament, with wages, tenip. Edward I. The town afterwards relapsed as a " decayed borough," or it was "disused." Three centuries ago it became flourishing and noted for its manufacture of broadcloth and fancy stufl-. Cnarles 1. maunicipaUy Incorporated its enterprising and affluent inhabitants, and from the spoils of the Reformation it secured a Royal grammar schooL It played a prominent and conspicuous Puritan part in the popular contest against the Stuarts, but at the Commonwealth period it was not specially privileged to return members to Parliament Jn the schemo of representation of Oliver, the " ord Protector." It did, however, participate in the revolution of po]tical power, every inhabitant of Kidderminster possessed to his own use of real or personal estate to the value of 2001. being entitled by the ordinance to a vote for five representatives of the county of Worcester-the city of Worcester being the only town separately enfranchised and returning two mermbers per se. Kidderminster, at this epoch of civic existence, could not have numbered 30 county electors. A century ago the manufacture of carpets was fortunately introduced. The population doubled between 1801 and 1831; in the latter year its inhabitants numbered about 15,000. It contributed its Political Union in aid of Birmingham. Lord Grey's Reform Act bestowed upon the town, with a properly enlarged boundary, the right of returning one member to the reformed representation. The gross population, not the relative number of 101. qualifications, ob. tained that "right." Eidderminster oame just within the scale, and had friends at Court. The Boundary Commissioners of 1831 specially reported that it would only yield between 400 and 500 10. tenements, "of which about 40 or 50 are situated beyond the boundary of the borough." They recorded in their rep.rt that
" The small proportion which the number of 101. houses bears to the population is remarkable, but may be accounted for by the unusually large proportion whioh the number of the labouring class bears to that of the other inhabitants."
Indeed, the year's amount of assessed taxes at that period was under 2,0001. Its municipal government was then selfelect, or " close ;" the local governing body consisting of a high bailiff, 12 aldermen, and 25 assistants; the latter, in fact, being mere honorary members of the corporation, having no authority. The high steward and the recorder were also non-resident, and were only honorary fanctionaries. The town-council had no property except a townhal], three small houses, and a market-house; all being " incumbered," the Commissioner of Municipal Inquiry in 1834 (the present Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas) reporting the mortgages at 8,900-" a sum not far short of the total value of the property." There was no civil court held under the municipal authorities. The police consisted of two constables, and the entire town at night was committed to the care of 1I nightly " charlies" or watchmen. The gaol would have petriaied even Howard. The following is its then description by Sir Alexander Cockburn:-
" There is one gaol belon gig to the corporation, which is used for the temporary confement of prisoners previously to commitment. It is of a very inferior description, being situate under the Town-hall; and, in point of fact, nothing more than a cellar. affording no admission in a sufficient degree either to light or air. There are no beds in this prison, neither can a fire be lighted in it, whatever maybe the inclemency of the season. It was stated in evidence by one of the night constables, that having at times bad occasion to be in the prison with persons in custody, he had frequently, after staying in it an hour, been quite unwell from damp and chill. As the prison consists but of one room, it is impossible to keep prisoners separated from one another. The only aperture through which air is adroitted is an iron grating, level with the street, through the bars of which quills or reeds may be inserted. By this means drink is frequently conveyed to the prisoners, and it bas sometimes hagpened that persons confined during the night have been found the next morning so intoxicated as to be incapable of being examined by the magistrates P'
g Such was the " governent"r of Kidderminster two years fter its Parliamentary enfranchisement. By the Municipal Reform Act a polie rate is now raised, though still insufficient, for the conservation of life and property. Wine constables only existed to face the recent riot !
Now, what was tho social condition of the mass-the working classes 7 Of course, equaUy neglected. Wages had fallen considerably in 1832. In that year the Right Hlon. Charles Villiers, as a Poor Law Sub-Commissioner, reported that " the increaqe of their numbers and their general improvidence have occasioned a great faU in wages and much distress." Masters and Men were demoralized so far as their relative duties and rights. A Kidderminster vestry, alarmed by the pressuro of poor rates, had reported to the ratepayers "that a practice had obtainedof labourers being engaged at half or even one-third of the usual rate of wages, upon an understanding with their employers that the difference should be made up to them from the parochial funds."
The Census Education Report and Tables (1&53) return only three fountains of adult knowledge under the denomination of "Literary, Sdentific, and MechenicsIistitu. tions." The first was termed the " Kiddermsinster Athen. neum," the members paying 8s. per annun, in numlber 31, with a library of 400 volumes. The return as to frequency.
of lectures states " sometimes." The second is caUled the IC MiltoDn Institution," With>22 members, paying 6s. per annum, possessing 600 volumes. Its return as to lectures was " none." The third institution was maintained by 49 members, contributing 2s. 6d. per quarter, having accumulated 278 volumes; no lectures. Thus, in a population ex ceeding 30,000, 102 persons only provided themselves with OnteUectusl culture after the period of school, and of which gross number the females were only four.
I now come to a brief history of the Parliamentary representation of Kidderminster. In 1832-3 the first election for this "virgin borough" was disgraced by an expenditure of several thousand pounds on both sides, the late Mr. Godson, a Tory, polling 172 votes, and defeating a Liberal (the present Sir G. R. Philips), who polled 159 votes. Both candidates expending in "treating" and hired mob partisans large sums, a petition could not expediently be prosecuted. In 1835 the tables tarned, Mr. Philips winning by 197 votes, Mr. Godson polling only 124 A similar profligate expenditure accompanied this contest. Tn1837Mr. Godson recovered his ground, defeatingMr. John Bagshaw (the present member for Harwich) by 198 to 157. In 1841 Mr. Godson again met an opulent opponont. Mr. Sampson Ricardo appeared, as a stranger, on the issue of the writ, but polling only 200 against 212. This contest was a sceno of riot and costly drunkenness. It is notorious in the borough that the defeated candidate within a week expended 4,000., that his successful opponent exceeded that sum, and that the " managers" of both parties did not abstain from bribery. Hired mobs were the order of the day. In 1847 Mr. Godson walked over the course, his purse and his invincible determination affrightingall comers. It is equally notorious that Ridderminster cost that gentleman " a fortune." On his death, ia August, 1849, Mr. Best, a barrister, son of a local merchant, became the " Protectionist candidate." The Liberal party, diseusted by the previous costly and uasuccesaful management of its interest, resolved to fight a "pure election." The late Mr. Thomas Gisborne was their chosen candidate. He polled 200 against 217. Itis well knownthat Mr. Gisborne might have bought the return by purchase of a small and floating party, but'he declined the bargain.
Such were the earlier contests and the state of the borough paries when the dis0olution of 1852 ocourred, con. sequent on Free Trade. At that period, the local parties much broken up, the leadlng men of all sections deemed it high time to make common cause, to combine in the election. Th e " influence" of Lord Ward has been mentioned in relation to thisborough. The fact is that hisLordship's influence is small, though, of course, desirable, but that nobleman acceded to the selection of a creditable candidate. Mr. Lowe contr '-d thereturn, as the elect of the large raajorityof all classez,ousting Xr.Bestby246votesagainstl52. Onaccepting office Mr. Lowe was re-elected without opposition. His xeturns, to my knowledge, havebeenperfectlypure. I now arrive at the last and eventfl election. No contest could be more wanton or unjustifiable. It was an appeal only to a small minority, on no principle, tuless to gratify the vanity ofthe opponent. The result is before the country, in the disgrace Of the borough and the temporary embittering of lasses. On previous occasions "treating" had been the benefot of publicans. But, to the honour of the former elas, the large majority disinterestedly supported Mr. Lowe. Nevertheless, I cannot but complete my local statistics by the record of the extraordinary number Of publicans and beershop-keepers in this thirsty borough, The Parliamentary License returns of 1852 exhibit the almost incredible figures of 84 publicans and 66 beershop. keepers I Of this " licensed" body 109 persons were on the register of Parliamentary electors, in a gross constituency of 494-viz., 70 publicans and 39 beer retailers I Jn a population of such demand for fermented liquors can we marvel that the sanitary and educational government reports are uncomplimentary to the Kidderminster community-that the church accommodation is small-that the comparative numbers of the educated and untaught are discreditable-that savage riots and hired mobs have repeatedly disgraced its election contest ? By the last census returns the united libraries for instruction of the working classes comprised, I think, in gross only 400 volumes.
I have no personal knowledge of Mr. Lowe. 1 only respect him as a rising and remarkable public man, of distin. guished talents and accomplishments. Nor do I occupy so large a space of your journal from any motives or objects In connexion with the borough he honourably represents; I freely admit thatEidderminster has electoraUy redeemedits political character by the election of such a man; but I have simply recorded facts as iUustrative of the social condition of the non-electors, and as startling proofs that the upper and middle classes of Kidderminster, and all our manufacturing and rural districts, must combine to raise the moral and inteUectual principles and the habits of the people-to enhance their physical comforts and enjoyments-ana ro teach thea to know and to value their own better interests. The demagogues, be they who they may, and the higher pro. moters of the, abominable riots hi Kidderminster (if any) are the real ringleaders, however behind the scenes, and far more deserving of punishment. No stone ought to be left unturned to detect the instigators. The town was more or less in a state of riot the whole election day, and some of the principal inhabitants were also victims of ouLtage and severe personal injury. If impunity is to follow such lawless and barbarous acts the repetition of them is certain. Your contemporary, the Bxaminer, remarldng on the magisterial laches in fines of some of the convicted rioters of Is. each, well observes, "If these be specimens of Eidderminster justice, let us not be astonished at Kidderminster outrages." Mr. Lowe may have his head again broken, on the popular idea that he has brains to spare.
An extension of the franchise in lKidderminster to Si. rated occupiers would raise the constituency to 2,410 electors. If this increase be effected by a coming further Xeform Bill, and withoat conditions for a purification of such an electoral qualification, or unaccompanied by an improved mode of record of the vote, what may be the character of the next contest, or of the successful candidate ?

Equalization Of The Poor-Rate.
EQUALIZATION O THE POOR-RATE.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIDMS.
Sir,-The inequality in the assessments of different parishes to the poor-rate, alluded to by an "at-end Churchwarden," has not escaped notice as an element to be corrected when the equalization of the London rates takes place. Every suggestion for this equalization is founded upon the idea of equal valnes paying equal amounts, and the best means of obtaining an equitable valuation is undoubtedly by the property-tax valuation. This applies to all the metropolis, and is a fair, just, and equal assessment. Besides, it can be applied at once without expense, as all the data are already obtained.
For the information of the vast multitude of your taxpaying readers I subjoin a few instances of the assessment inequality in London parishes:-
rab Property-tax Poor-rate
Value. Aueament. St. George's-in-the-East £106,469 ... £i3,297 Whttechare3 Union .. 223,087 .. .. 228c6 Bermondy ... .. .. 128,0 .. . 309 Bethnal-grn . ..1.8I92? .. .. 130,1 5
Inthese unions, admittedly the most destitute in the metropolis, the assessment equals or exceeds the rack value of the property, and in St. George's is one-third more than the rack value. Now, is this the case generally throughout London ? If it be, there is no great injustice done. Lot us take a few instances in other localities
Pariah. Prroerty-tax Pcer-rate
Val. AFseument, St. George's, Hanover-uare £1,C97,688 . .. £69,36o. Mnyleboue . .. .. 1,168,657 - . 1-. 81,485 Hackney Union .. 470,351 . . - 231,393 West London Union. .. 226,895 .. .. 1610 IWineon .. .. .. 49,773 .. . 5 172,381 Paddi n ..o .. .. 43$7i3 . 390,730
In all these cases the disproportion between the true value and the poor-rate assessment is most glaring * they re not only lightly rated-none of them, except the West London, exceeding Is. 6d. in the pound, and the rates 'of St. George's, Hanover-square, and Paddington, the two richest, being only 7ad.-but the property is most unfairly exempted by a low fictitious value being substituted for the real worth. One would think that the difference between 7id. and is. in the pound would have been a sufficient one, without adding to it by such an inequality in the assess. ment. The total property-tax value of London is about 13,500,0001. annually; the poor-rate assessment is only 10,000,0003., the richer parishes being assevsed at the lowest rate, and the poorer ones at the highest. Is this fair? I am, Sir. yours. &o.

POLICE.
MANSIONEHOUMS-Thomas Walcot, formerly a journey. man in the setvice of Messrs. moces and Son, shoe-manu. facturers and merchants on Tower-hill, was brought before Mr. Alderman HALr4 charged with having robbed that firm, whilein their employment, of six pairs of water-tight boots, Mr. Lewis said, he a peaed on the part of Messrs. Moses and Son to prosecute tile prisoner for a felony committed while in their service, and it would ultimately turn out that the prisoner had beeu connected with five men now on remand upon a charge of having plcndered a great number of packages of large atities of boots and shoes belonging to PA9. Isenburg, of Leadenhall-street.
Mr. B. Moses, one of the prosecutors, said,-The prisoner was in our employment as warehouseman for nine years
revious to the 4th of November last. In May last
received a written communication, in consequence of which I deemed it my duty to watch what was going forward on my premises. On the 4th of NTovember I dismissed the prisoner from my service. During the last 12 or 18 mnonths he was in our employment we missed large quantities of goods; amounting in value to about 1,0001. We had also in our employment a man named Timothy Desmond, who was dismnssed on the same day that the prisoner left. On the day in question I found in a cellar adjoining our premises, which was used as a tinman's shop, and in which Deemond used to make paokingeases, six pm-rs of watertight boots, of the value of 31. From information I received I caused the prisoner to be apprehended last night. *Upon being brought to my house by the officer he said that both he and Desmond hadbeen deeply implicated in robbing me,andheaskedmeto forgivehim forthesakeof biswife and family. I told him that the law must take its course. The goods we missed were chiefly boots and shoes, and a large quantity of knives.
Timothy Desmond.-I live at 85, Chamber-street, Goodman's-fields, and am a tinplate worker. Prior to the 4th of November last Ihad been for 13 years in the employment of the prosecutors. During a portion of that time the prisoner was m the same service, and during the last few months of our employment there we were in the habit of stealinproperty belonging to the prosecutors. We used to steal " water-tights." On the 4th of November, tho day we were dischrged, the prisoner brought to the cellar in which I was at work six pairs of watertight boots, but I had no opportunity of removing them before they were discovered by Mr. Moses. The prisoner and I shared money about a dozen times, the produce of goods stolen from Messrs. Moses. A man named George Boyce paid me on several occasions for goods which had been stolen by the prisoner and myself. We shared upwards of 501. between us. A man named Pickering used also to convey goods away, and he has paid me about 121., of which the prisoner received his proper proportion. The selling price Of the stolen boots was lUs. per pair, and we used to get 4s. per pair for them. The goods used to be taken to the house of Boyce, wvho has paid me money for goods that I had stolen and delivered to Pickering
Prisoner.-Have you told the truth? Witness.-I have.
Prisoner.-What did you give me for the boots?
Witness.-They were sold at 4s. a-pair, and out of 24s. I gave you 10s.
Prisoner.-Are you not ashamed to look at me? You confess yourself to be a thief.
Witness.-I don't know why I should be ashamed of myself, rm sure.
Prisoner.-You are the biggest villain upon earth, and you ought to have a rope round your neck.
P. W. Donoway, a metropolitan police-constable, No.
129 H, said heapprehended the prisoner, who confessed to. Mr. Moses that he had been deeply implicated in robbing him, and asked for forgiveness.
The prisoner, after the usual caution had been given himi, said in reply to the chaige,-Mr.Moses has made the amount of which he has been robbed immensely too large.
He was then fully committed for trial
The LoRD MAYOR requested that the press would acknowledge the receipt of a 401. Bank of England note from "3L E. A," and of IO. from Messrs. Broughton, Hunt, and Broughton, forthe poor-box.
Bow-sTRsEr.-A well-dressed young man, who desrribed himself as a clerk, and said his name was John Fraser, but refused to give his address, was charged by Mr. J. HL F. Lewis, of Essex-street, Strand, solicitor, with indecentlv exposing himself in the street, opposite complainant's house.
The prisoner said there must be some mistake. He was remanded for further examination.
WES=sTsR .-On Monday a woman 70 years old and her maiden daughter, a shrewish-looking excitable person of about 35, both of whom gave their names Anne Eobinson, were charged with being disorderly at the house of Mr.
Morris, 19, Lower Beigrave-street. They had gone there on. the previous evening and set up a claim to the rent of the house, which was resisted on the ground that they had no title to it, upon which they knocked violently at his door and collected several persons. The defendants, after a suitable admonition from the Bench, were discharged upon entering into their recognizances to keep the peace. Yesterday, however, they were again brought to this court charged under the following circumstances:-
Marian Morgan, housekeeper in the establishment of Viscountess Ponsonby, said that her Ladyship had been annoyed for some time past by the defendants, who had repeatedly been to the house, demanding the rent of it. They came again on Monday morning, together with two men and a woman. They made a great noise, and, although told that Lady Ponsonby never saw strangers, reFused to leave, Insisting upon an interview with her. Witness had promvionslzive, the yonnaer defendant the name of her Ladyshp's lawyer, to whom she was referred, but she replied that she had nothing to do with lawye±-s ; she managed her business herself. Finding they still continued in the house and made a great noise, the servants endeavoured to put them out. The younger defendant, who was very violent, struck witness a blow in the eye.
Ellen rnott, housemaid, said that the defendants had lbeen to the house repeatedly during the last year and a- half setting up a claima for rent. The party gave a double knock when they came on Monday evening, and upon the door being opened they all came into the passage. Witness tried to put the younger defendant out, when she struck her twice. Witness really thought, from her conduct that she must be insane. She had been repeatedly told that if she. had any clain upon her Ladyship she must apply to her solicitor.
Miss Robinson, in reply to the charge, said that her mother was next of kin to Miss Hawgood, and consequently was entitled to the rents of five houses in Chester-square, and four in Lower Belgrave-street. The estate, however, had been thrown into Chancery, but the suit had recently terminated in her favour, and the Lord Chancellor sent her a note, informing her that she was entitled to the rents. Her mothtr then appointed her the receiver, bat when she applied at Lady Ponsonby's she was told that the lawyers on either side would settle the matter. She wrote to Lady Ponsonby, but all the replyshe got was that her Ladyship had sent it to her solicitor. She went to the house with some friends on the previous evening, when she was struck by the witness 4rnott. She denied having intentionally assaulted the housekeeper, and said her hand might have touched her in preventing its being jammed in the doorwvay.
She called two witnesses who mainly proved that after defendants had been ordered out of the hiouse there was a great scuffle.
Mr. AiNoLD, in adverting to the excitability exhibited by the younger defendant, said It would be a waste of time to attempt to address her. He was under a strong impression that sho was labouriug under a delusion respecting the estate she spoke of, and feared that she was more entitled to commiseration than punishment. Whether her claim was imaginary or real, she was not justified in going to persons' houses and making this disturbance. She must enforce her claims by law, and eject or destrain, if she could find any broker insane enough to act upon her bare word. He had told her on the previous day that she could not be permitted to break the peace, and had dismissed her upon entering into her own recognizances, and, instead of profiting by his caution, she had repeated the offence with even more violence than before. He was wiUing to suppose that the blows had been accidentally given in the scufle, but it was necessary that she should be restrained, and be therefore called upon her to find baiI, but discharged the old lady with a caution.
WoRsl-sTsRe.--George Hollis, a young man described as a gasfitter and pewterer, in Rose and Crowncourt, Finsbury, was charged on re-examination with stabbing his wife.
Sarah Crater, the prisoner's sister-in-law, stated,-At 4 O'clock on Sunday afternoon I, the prisoner, and his wife were all together in the sitting-room, when my sister, who was making a pair of trousers, suddenly stopped, and said she should not do so, as it WaS very unlucky to work on a Sunday. Prisoner said, " Won't you do them? Then I will have your life." She replied, " lNo, George, I will not, for it is unlucky, I tell you." Prisoner Immediately took a clasp-Iknife out of his pocket, opened it, and, standing in the front of her, raised his hand. She bent down, and the blade went into her right shoulder, behind. He struck her with great force. Prisoner was sober; and his wife exclaimed, "Oh, George, you have stabbed me !" I screamed "Murder !" and he said "Hush, hush !" I have seen the wound, and it looks very bad. Mysister and I went to the doctor's immediately. and had the wound examined. Prisoner is a very bad temper, and his hand trembled with passdon before he struck her. Just before my sister put her
word aown I was changingmyfrock, andlhe put his handurn me indecently and pinched me. She saw him do it, an I think it was that made her put her work down and then throw it out of the window. I went down and picked it up out of the backyard. She laughed at him just before he stabbed her, and told him " Sit down, don't put yourself into a passion; you had no right to do such a thing to her. Yon are a nasty fellow." It was after this that be struck and stabbed her as I have described. The prisoner left the house, but In the evening, towards dark, while my sister was in bed from the wound, my little brother, at the street door, told me the prisoner was there, and on seeing him over the way I asked him to come up and see her. He did so, and asked her how she was then. She replied,-"Very bad- and I hope you will not come near me any more. I donet want to see your face " and he went away directly. They have no family, 'have only been married a year and a-quarter, and were alwavys uarrelling. My sister was In a bad sate of health before this through the prisoner's habits.
William Stephenson, of Doggett's-court, Moorflields.-I found the knife produced (a clasp-knife, with a blade very sharp but very rusty) in our back-yard, half ooen, on Sunday afternoon. Iheard something fall, and on l7ooking what it was I found the}knife.
A certificate from a surgeon named Elwin having been put in, descnbing the wife as confined to her bed with a punctured wound in the shoulder, accompanied by inflammation and fever, the prisoner was upon this evidence remanded tfll yesterday, when the e, a pretty young woman, who wept bitterly while givngherevidenee against her husband, was brought to the cour and after describ
the provious part of the transaction in much the same terms as the first witness, but with a manifest feeling throghou notto sy moe aginstthe prisoner thanm she could help, stated,-Tho prisoer told hme if I did not do the trousers he would have my life. I laughed at and aggravated him very much, and then (bursting out sobbing) he up with the knife from his right-hand pocket, with th
blade onen, and again askea M6 if Iwoula do them. I said I woul not, and he then struck me in the shoulder- but I think he only did it to frighten me; he did not s e me with much force. I screamed on feeling that I was cut, and told him he had stabbed me.' My sister screamed "M 3urder I" and he sid, "For God's sake, hush P, I bled X great deal, and went with mJy sister to a surgeon's, who probed the wound, and said it wAs nearly an inch deep. On returning home my husband was gone. Three bours after he returned and appeared very sorry,-indeed, I am sure that he is so,-and spoke very kindly. He is very hottempered. Itwaslwihotoldhimtogo way, asaconstable was after him, andhe therefore went. The wound is in the soft part of the shoulder, but isnow quite well. I stooped when he aimed the blow at me, or it would otherwise have struck my left breast.
The prisoner, w/ho appeared to bevery distressed and melancholy, wvas aked iEhe wished to put any questions to his wife, bat replied in the negative, and was therefore remanded for the completion oE the depositions.

Elizabeth Creasy, of No. 1, Lion-street, New Kent-road, said she was at No. 18 in the same streOt on Saturday night last, when one of the prisoner's children came down etairs and said his mother had sent him out and had locked the door. Witness went uptirs insantly and knockedat the door,andreceiviog no awer she forced it open. On entering the room slhe Iound the prisoner hanging bys r Ope and

Police-constable Daniel Moore, 241 P, deposed tbht about ll o'clock on Saturday night he went to the house No. 18, Lion-street, New Kent-road, and there found the prisoner lying on a mattress in a very exhausted state, and observed a deep mark, as If caused by a rope, round herneck He, also Tound Chat she had supended herself from a beam and had very narrowly escaped death. When asked b the magistrate what she had to say to the charge,. t e unfortunate prisoner seemed in such a state as to be incapable of answering; but Cook the gaoler, said, from a converstion he had had with her, it appeared that her husband had been at one time a licensed hawker, and made a good living for herself and-her family, but some time sine he had the misfortune to meet witbk and join a set of card.sharpers, and, since that time had nothing but a conhnuathon of misfortunes. When her husband had been committed from this court in November last the money found on him had been appliedtohis support in prison, and she and her three children were left penniless, and the consequence was that they were obliged to go into the workhouse. There they remained until his release about four weeks ago, when they came outand went to live in Lion-street. A want of success on the part of her husband kept them very low, and his apprehenson so soon again left her and her family nothing but ruin ataring them ie the face, for the first week he was remanded she had been obliged to part with a large portion of her thing, and finding on :aturday last that there was no chance of his discharge, but, on the contrary, that he was likely to get 12 months' for his offence shoeparted with the remainder of her things, gave her chcliren something to eat, and made up her mind to hang herself.
Mr. BLLoTT rennded the prisoner for a week.
George Lee, a lad employed by the South-Western Railway Company as a van guard, and Robert Barnes, a youth formerly mn the employ of the same company, but who had been discharged, were placed at the bar on a chare of stealing, the former a silver teapot, and the latter a safver slugarbasin, both of the value of 20L, from the company's premises.
From the evidence it appeared that early in the month of December last the masmve articles in question had been packedup in a box by a lady in Hampshire to be forwvardedtoher silveramith in town, and the box-was entrusted to *~carrier to be delivered at the Fareham station, tobe forwarded bythe South-Westerallailway. The carrier, however, instead o paying for the box ani having it entered and forwarded iU the usual way, gave it in as an empty box, and it was forwarded with other lumber to the Nine-elms station, whero it remained for some days in the open yard. The prisoners being employed about there, opned the box and helped themselves to its contents, Lee taking the teapot and Barnes the basin. Inquires respecting the property had been going on, butn re ting it had been diovered until Monday, when the mother of Lee offered the teapot in pledge at Mr. S vage's, a in Iambetb, who stopp Sit.
The prisoners pleaded " Guilty," and were sentenced to four months' hard labour each.

Advice To Filibusters.
AID VICE TO FILIBUSTERS.
The Newv Yorki Tinu's publishes the following address I 'o the Filibusters remaining with Walker, itsued by a body of deserters from 'Walkers force in Nicaragua, who were well received and hospitably treated by the Costa RicEu, and shipped, with passage paid, to New York:-
" Countrymen and Fellow-Soldiers,-We, the asndersigned, deriring to erncourage you to foUow our example and leave a dishonoarable ansd thduiness service, do hereby pledge our word of honour a.s fellowsoldiers, and owr brotberly faith a scountrymen in a foreign land, that implicit reliaRon may bo placed by yoa in all the proclantatioms of the Governiment of Costa Riea, inviting yOe to lay down yeur arms, and promissing a 'free transit and assistance to the United States. aThe GOvernment of Costa Rica goes still'further in practice 'tlan in the proclamations, for she allows (and protects) all -who prefer remalisin and settling .ia'the co intry to going
.ome, to do so npon as favourable terunn as she grants to any foreigners vithin ker torritery.
Sinoe we olainied the ,rotecteion of Costa Rica we have 'teen'treatedin such a Inasaeras tceause us to regret that ve ve bore Arms against her, and suoh as to inspire us with zentiments of respeot ead gratitode, very foreign to those with which base and icterested'parties had inspired us by 'false representations ere we had any other bitt hostile inter'course with the natives of the State.
" On the Toute into the country, from the time we en'conntered the first Costa 'Rican picket until the present, all our waRsts have been supplied by the Government or people, far better than the mantrap Walker ever supplied them ; and there ismot 'a doubt Mit that the Government will continue'to supply them, until we either leave for home or ake employment in the country with the view of settling here.
",Friends of all grades and countries now in Nicaragua, -we earnestly urge you, for your o an sakes and the sake of 'humanity, to desert at-ence, and in a body, the man whom you full well know, by bitter experience, has bat deceived vYou from the first moment you were engaged in his service by hi; interested myrunidons
" How many of you are there who were induced to come to the country as perceable emigrants, some bringing wives 'and children'? ilow were you received when you arrived in -Nicaragua? Were you assigned land by the Colonization-offlice? Were you furnished with seeds and agricultural implemonts, and facilitated in taking possession of and
-commenoing the cultivation of yoar 250 acres (or more) of land? Tou ory along with us, I No!' And we respond Wat you A2u1 weul know, you were handed a musket or rifle ,3t your introduction to hicaragua, and told you were enrolled in some company to fight for the land you were to ha,ve, and fight for it, too, against the natural and rightful -owners of it; but, above all, you were to fight to advance the mad ambition of a man so devoid of natural sympathies and the sentiments which ennoble human nature, tisat he wouldfeel no compunction of consdienco in destroying a world, did he but think he would reign king, even only over i's desolation.
" To one and all who came with whatever expectations or 'under whatever inducements, we ask what thanks or emoln:ment h.we you received, or can you expeeb to receive, from impoverished Nicaragua, or thankless, unfeeling Walker? .For all the toils and privations, the night marchings and watchings, the hungerings and thirstings, the sickness, 'wounds, and battles you have experienced and suffered in one form or other, we answer emDhatically and truly, None. Where is the realization of aU the briliant promises from 'time to time made by the arch Filib6ster and his myrmidons? vanished into thin air, or rather into tho sulphurous vapour 'of villanous gunpowder.
" What benefit have you received, or are you likely to receive, from the hard-fought battles of Riiva', first and second, Virgin Bay, Masaya or Granada, or the terrible sufferings of the return from Santa Rosa? Think of the horrors of the siege of Granada, where the sick and dying lay mingled with the dead and wounded, where innocent and helpless women and children were dying in your very sight from privation and sickne3s, while you yourselves were supporting a feeble strength apon unnatural and loathsome food, to enable you to resist a victorious oneimly, and viutorious onlythrough the notorious incapability of lhim whom you looked to for guidance and direction,
" And all these trials and horrors you have experienced for no other available purpose batt to gratify the wildest species of insane ambition with which God ever scourged Qhmanity for its sins.
" This man does not even possess the tact or ability to gain a-id keep some small portion of the respect and affection of yourselves, his soldiers. You do not either love or respect him as a man, or confide in bin as a good general. Why, then, do you still cling to him Is it that you fear treacherous treatment on the partof an enemy who offIr such liberal, even generous terms? If such should be the reason of your still adhering to a dishonourable God-and. man abhorredand failing cause, we tell you, brothers, dismiss it at once from your minds, for the pledge we have given you we call God and the world to witziess as truth.
"'There is no dishouour in the soldier's deserting a dishonourable cause.
"Desert it, then, one and all: and for the sake of humanity, by so doing, put a speedy end to the unavailing bloodshed and suffering which have so uselessly entitled Nicaragua to the epithet which once attached to our now bappy and peaceful Kentucky, of the 'dark and bloody ground."'
State Of Trade.
SrATE OF TRADE.
MANCHESTER, Aritte 14.
In cloths we have had a flet market, particularly for India goods, the letters by this nmail not coining to band until this afternoon. The high price of discounts for India biUs, -which is about 7 per cent., also tends to cheek business. For the heavier makes of cloth, such as longeloths, T-cloths, and domestics, there is stiU a demand at fall prices. In yarns the market is not active, but there is enough business to keep prices firm, and in some cases, where there are no stooks, and spinners are well engaged, as much as Ad. per lb. advance has been given. A small cloth-agent is reported to have suspended payment, with liabLlities to the amount of about 10,0001.

NOTTINGHAM, APRIL 14.
The bome demand for lace continues good, but the holy. days are interfering with business this week. Plain nets are in request at high prices, and there are signs of improvement in the fancy and silk branches. The price of silk and cotton is stiU very high.
T'hle hosiery trade has been active for a considerable period, and is still in a satisfactory state.
Worsted yarns and silk are exceedingly dear.
LEICESTER, ArRIL 14.
We are in the midst of the Easter holydays, and therefore there is not much doing. In most branches business is quiet. Up toi the present time the operatives have been tolerably employed, and as stocks are low anything like a demand will cause briskness in the labour-market.
LEEDS, APRIL 14.
There has been a little more inquiry for light materials asitable for spring, but in the other branches of the woollen cloth trade no improvement has been manifested since S.turday. The holyday seasons generally influence business, ar.d this morning there was only a smaUattendanceof purchasers at thecloth-haUs. The transactions were few, and a quiet tone prevailed. The inclemency of the weather tends to retard the demand for summer goods.
HIUDDERSFIELD, APiTTL 14.
The cloth trade of this district has rather retrogradcd, the improvement noticed last week 2not having been maintianed. There have only been a small number of buyers in -the town, who have principally bought odd lots, at a little reduction in price, or have contented themselves with looking out for new patterns. There is no animation in any branch of the trade.
Plaistow And Its Population.
PLALSTOW ANTD ITS POPULATION.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMIES.
Sir,-Perhaps no one can more faithfully, and with greater knovledge of facts than myself, corroborate the statement of Mfr. Brady in Thtc Timncs of last Thursday, as to the deplorable state of the roads, ditches, &c., in the Victoria Dook district of my parish. I have watched the progress of this large population from its commencement; I have seen with painful interest house succeed to house, row to row, without the slightest attempt at drainage; in. -deed, the attempt woesId have been useless.
As buildings inoreased, the ditches, which of old used to son one into anotUer, gradually became detached; as a mecessary consequence :th of the most injurious descrip. tion stealbhily but sureLy rose inch by inch to the surface, imtil, in many instances, they became cylinders of mud. I think I could point out chronologically every cylinder -thus created.
There certainly have been attempts to improve the 3roads. The refuse of coke.cvena, glass-works, &c., has from time to time been thrown upon them; but the ,first truly wet day made them ac bad as ever, with a somewhat deeper tinge-of Ldack, so that John Bunyan's descrip. iion of -the 5ltough of Despond has perpetually recurred ,tome as literally verified in tbis part :-(I quote merely -from memory). " Yea.; to my knosrledge cartloads of good material have beon heaperi upon it af by any meas some impravement midst be mana; butali to no purpose, for all that has been done, or is Jikaly to,beo-dne, it is the Slough .of Despond till."'
I hve kelpt a statisCloal accotnt of deaehs in this district sas compared 'vUth -thoa in PlF ' bow proFer, and in one particir halfy"ar, when the popxation .of the two places was about baancd ,(if we except 1 days duiqg which the cholern ravaged one small locality) the propocrtim was very pearly 69ve to one. I called on the vicar of mn adjoining parish idmilarly cireumstanccd (in miniature) to mine, Amnd he remarked that 16 had kept a similar register, and found the proportion exacly the name.
This is a fearful state of things indeed, and, if I could btn t Save one wish granted me, it would be that two or three gentle. men, whose influence in the State could procure redress, khould meet me at the Barking-road station on some wet ,day, or better still (except that there is no time to lose) on sc.me hot July day, that I might introduce them to sights
e have never before seen, the like to which I firmly belie" does not exist in any other part of the kingdom.

NEWMARKET RACES, THIS DAY.
Four races are set for this day, the first at half-past 2 o'clock.
The attendance on the heath showed a marked improvement over that of Monday. A drenching rain fell during the night, but a strong wrind produced a most beneficial effect upon the ground, which could not be called "had going." No special train, not even one to Cambridge in connexion with the five minutes PsaSt 7 o'clock train for Londonwa put on by the Eastern Counties Railway Company, and those persons who wished to return to town in the evening nad scarcely time to see the principal race, and were sub ected to much inconvenience and annoyance. Had they ben double the distance from London, and had theracing been an hour later, they could have witnessed the whole of the sport and got away without the slightest hurry or trouble. The last train from Newvmarket is at 25 minutes past 4.
The Colliery Explosion At Lundhill.
THE COLLIBEY EXPLOSION AT LUNDHILL.
On Sunday last, in oonsequence of the finding of the body on Friday night, the pit was visited by great numbers during the day, many of those present being relatives of the unfortunate men in the pit, as it was generally thought that otber bodies would float on the pit being unroofed. At 6 o'clock in the evening the chair which was at the bottom of the shaft, and which could not be pulled up with the entire strength of the two powerful engines, was bared about two or three inches. As the removal of this obstruction was essentially necessary not only with regard to the using of both buckets and the speedy emptying of the pie, but also the liberation of any of the bodies which might be kept down by the chair, it was determined late on Sunday night that an attempt should be made the next morning to hoist it out, and that no efforts should be wanting to eZlect this most dangerous but highly important object, which would be the means of mairiDg the emptying of the pit a comparatively easy matter, occupying only some tbree or four days. For this purpose, at 8 o'clock on Monday morning, five picked men descended to the surface of the water in the shaft and examiDed the cbair, which they found to bave diverged from the centre of the shaft under one of the arcliways cominmicating with the workings of the pit. Their first object was to endeavour to get it into the centre, so that it might be drawn np, butthis they fonnd a work not only of great difficulty, but of considerable danger, as aLl of them had to work in the water, which would be abou5 seven feet up the sbsft. After almost superhuman efforts for upwards of eigbt hours, the men ali the time being dienched to the sklin, the heavy, cumbersome chair gave way, and was moved into the ccntre, and was then raised by the power of the two engines. Along with the clair two corves were also brought up, as well as a considerable quantity of wood and other materials. The conductors, it was then found, required repairing and lengthening. The getting out of the chair, the most important and difficult operation that has yet taken place since the opening of the shaft, will, it is expected, speedily bring the labours of the gentlemen on whom has devolved the responsibilty of extinguishing the fire and reaching the bodies to a conclusion.
Considerable dissatisfaction has been expressed as to the conduct of the jud;cial f nctionaries in leavibg the body in the shed where it was removed on Friday nigbt, without having it either viewed by the jury, if that was indispensable, or givng an order for its burial, so that the body of the unortunate victim was left in almost the last state of decomposition from Friday night up to Monday afternoon witbout its being known what was to be done with it.
On Monday evening, however, an order for its interment having been received from the coroner, the remains of the unfortunate man were buried. Whether any special order to exempt the coroner and jury from viewirg the bodies had been issued or not we were not able to ascertain * but in this inctance the body was -not viewed, from which it seems probable that such an order has been received.
The interment was conducted with the greatest secrecy under the superintendence of Mr. Green, superintendent of the Barnley plice force. The body was taken from the shed by two of the workmen employed at the pit, and placed in a conveyance, and it reached the Darfield Churchyard about 7 o'clock. By this time a report had got abroad that the body was about to be interred, and a 1ISIN concourse of spectators, chiefly women, assembled round the grave. The funeral service was impressively read by the xLv. B. Charlesworth, vicar of Darfield, andtheproceedings were of so solemn a character that scarcely a dry eye was to be seen. Had the proceedings not been conducted with such secrecy, there is no doubt but that a much larger number of persons would have been present. The cofn having been deposited in one of the comnartments of the graves constructed for the reception of 16O7bodies, it was sealed in such a manner as to prevent any noxious smell arising therefrom.
From the time of the chair being got out up to yesterday afternoon (the time of our parcel being despatched the ope. rations of draining had boee suspended, and the workmen were employed in getting. out -d_b-is and lengthening and repairing the conductors at-the bottom of the shaft. These cgerations are very tedious, and the men engaged in them are constantly drenched with water. Bat for these stop. pagh the pit would now have bei# unroofed. It was, how. ever, expected that by last gve g the operations would have ag%Ja fairly commened, if no further stoppages take plaoc the water is expeptgeto be unroofed this day. Yesterday afrn°oon it 'was vpry currently ramoured that the bodies of a man and two boys had eeen found, but whether correct or Pt*wise our reporte hb4 W meas of ascertaining.

Farm Leases.
FABM LFASES.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Perhaps xr. Pearson, who writes in 2we Times of to, day in regard to long leases, is not aware of the fact that at least in one district of Scotland tenancy agreements eaduring for four or five years certain have been in uee for many years. The principal objection to them is that they are virtualy perpetual th some rupture takes place between the landlord and tenant, and there are few landlords who either like to warn away a tenant without very good reasons, or tD have anything like a zuptrre with him.
Now, with leases which run for , 19, or 21 years, the time of expiry is known to a day, and the proprietor cau look forward to advance of rent being received if the times warrant the expectation,vwithout doing anything unpleasant to the tenant. Under the running four or five years' leass the landlord is sometimes induced to wain away the tenant s;mply that be may get an advance of rent; and the latter, being annoyed at tbni, is tempted to scourge the soil more than he would bave done had he been bringing a long lease to its natural termination.
The three years' leases suggested by Mr. Pears8n wiU not suit improviDg tenants. Many investments in land are four or five years before they yield their fiaits, and no wsn who cares for his own interests wiU be disposed to risk his capital on any such uncertain tenure.
There can be no donbt that the fixed lease of say 1.5 or 19 years is the best for all parties. It secures the rights of the tenant, and yet affords the landlord an opportunity of getting a periodical a ivance of rent as orten, perhaps, as he could wel expect it. To prevent his gettingbad tenants he ought to be very careful in selecting them, and in miking ful inquiry respecting their characters, skUJ, and means; and if he holds out suitable encouragement he will, with ordinary care and discrimination, easily obtain good tenants; but otherwise he has no right to expect that they will be inclined to come his way.

Accident To Mr. J. G. Dodson, M.P.-On
AccmDz-rT To MR. J. G. DODSON, M.P.-On Thursday afternoon, after the declaration of the poll for East Stissex, an accident occurred to MIr. Dodson, which, though at first assuming an appearance calculated to excite alarm, happily resulted in no personal injuiy. Having trausacktd buniness in the committee-room at Albion-stree=, Mr. Dodson mounted a gig with his brother-in-law, Mr. W. Campion, in order to proceed to Danny. The maro he was diving was a high-spirited ore, belonging to Mr. Read, poeting-maser, and while standing at the door of tho committee-room had manifested signS of impatience and excitement at the noise of the bands and the huzzaing and the waving of flags. She started with the OCcupants of the giz m a nervous, flurried manner, and when they had gone a mile out of Lewes on the Offham road they overtook a number of labourers and children carrying some flags with Mr. Fuller's and Lord Pevenseys colours. Apparently without any evil intention the flags were suddenly unfurled as the gig came up. Mr. Dodson was drivig on the right band side, close to the raised footpath, in order to pass the party with the flags, when the mare, with a sudden bound, sprang with her forelegs on to the path, andendeavoured to leap down, gig and all, into the field on the other side of i*. Mi. Dodson succeeded in pulling her back into the road, but the jerk back snapped the shafts off close to the body of the gig, the latter turning completely over. The gentlemen extricated themselves from the reversed gig without seriouts injury to themselves, while the mare lay kicking and plunging about amoong the broken harness. Assistance was soon obtained, and tho horse and broken vehicle were taken back to Lewes, while another chaise was obtained in which the
tentlemen were safely conveyed to their destination,ASu8me Advert zsr.
We are requested to state thit it was "CisB3 Jane Evans," and not "M Miss Victor," who played the part of Marie St Clair in tbe D(ah ofEr at b4ler's-W=Is on Monday evening.
The Public Health.
THE PUBLIO REALTH.
(From the Reeistr-General's Weeirlv rwyn- ip
The deaths registered in london, which in the previous week were 1,235, in the week that ended on Saturday do. clined to 3,059. In the 10 Yeas 1817.56 the average number of deaths in the weeks corresponding with last week was 1,104. But, as the deaths of last week occurred in an increased population, the average should be rased. for the purposo of comparison in proportion to the increase, in which case it becomes 1,214. Hence it appears that the deaths now roturned were less by 155 tham the number which the average rate of mortality would have produced.
The deaths last week referred to diseases of the zymotic class were 18L while the correoted average of corresponding weeks is 246. Typhus and common fever were fatal in 50 caes (20 of which ocwurted in the north distrirts); the average is 48. Fifty children died of whoopingcough; the number according to the average rate of mortality would have been 63. Twenty-three children died of scarlatina, the average being 36. Measles was fatal in 17 cases, the average being 25; smallpox in 3 cases, the average being 14; and diarrhoea in 10 cases, the average being 16. No deaths from smallpox occurred in the east, Routh, or west districts, and none from measles in the west districts, a portion of the metropolis which was remarkably exempt from fatal cases of the zymotic diseases. Threechildrendiedat 17, New-end, Hampstead, on the 2d, 3d, and 6th inst. respectively, of fever; they appear to have taken fever in Hampstead, to which they had been brought for change of air when recovering from whoopingcough. Bronchitis carried off 113 persons, and pneumonia, 81; both numbers being near their respective averages Four persons died of intemperance; 2 of delirium trcmn . 2 of carbuncle. Two women died at the age of 94, and one in Lewisham Workhouse at the age of 96.
Last week the births of 835 boys and 773 girls,-in all 1,608 children,-were registered in London. In the 10 corre. sponding weeks of the years 1847-56 the average number was 1,51L
At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height of the barometer in the week was 29-519 inches. The instrument ranged from 29-27 inches to 29-82 inches. The mea temperature of the week was 49 9 deg., which is 4-6 deg. above the average of the same week in 43 years. The mean dailv temperature was above the average on every day, except Saturday; on Sunday and Monday the excess was 10 deg. and 8 deg. The highest temperature ocourred on Sunday the 5th, and was 65 deg.; the lowest on Friday, and was 37-3. The range of temperature in the week was 27-7 deg. The mean dew point temperature was 45-0 deg., and the difference between this and the mean air temperature was 4 9 deg. The wind, which had alternated between south-east and south-west during the week, changed to north-west on Saturday. Rain fell on every day except Wednesday, and the whole amount of tli- week was 0-53 inches. Thunder was heard on Tuesday and Friday.
