That sufficient provision is made for the spiritual wants of our seamen athbose none will assert. Thatl106,286 of theDe, annually frqenuitIn

At home then, and mnore especially abroad, there is ample scope for a new Society, wbich by means of its agensm, wil aLoprjachthe saileren his own element,ansi from shin toship preach the Gosplof salvation.
To carry ouxt thin obj'ect the Sciety will employv chaplains and lay agents. Their sphere of action will be the wind-bound shipping In roadsteads and vessels lying in harbours and deckcs at home and abroad. They wil,bypubiomin)istrations,by private intercourse,and by the digitribution of the Scripturi o, &c., convey relgiGusv instruction to seamen, and thus endeavour to awaken them to a sense of their responsibilitlee, and to point thems to that rAviour who loved them and gave Himself for them.
To maintain a continuous, Individual overeight, seamen wll he furnished,with notes commending them to the spritual saxe of the various chaplains or missionary Agente at home ansi in foreign Porte. There notes, given by one chaplain onL the departure of a chip and received by another on its arrival, will ensure to the seamen affectionate counsel.
The Society will, moreover, press upon the notice of the seamea the advantages of sasors' homes, lendinglibraries, eavings'banks, &c.. every means, in short, by which his condition can be improved.
The Society earnestly entreats all Christian men to assist In extending to seamen those blessings which we all enjo'o shore, and of which thesaior s dpried taneary ae, nd itout which his highest inteest ar inianer f beng acrficd, edbimself lost for erer.

Th othpectaut features inthis undertaking are the following:_
First, That 210 miles of the railway are already opeu for Cradle,and eigh more are znearly completed.
Be d,, That about two-thirds of the Company's capital being provided by the Nassau Government in Four ptr Cent. Boads, every 41i

Third, That a dividend of at least seven per coot. per annum la thus secuedw to the shareholders during coDstruction.
The Nass..u Rallwars will contlinue the F'rankfurt and Wiesbadetn and the Wiesbaden an' RudetsehEno Lnes from Rudesheim to the frontier of Prussia, oppositeCOubleotz. As the Cologne Railway, already open to Bonsn annaIRolandswerth is being rapidly completed to Cohlentz, the line of railwasy comumofcianu betweenL Cologne and Frnkfert will thus be completed by toie Nawau Company.
The annual traffle betwten these two points considerably exceeds 1.000,000 passengers and 1,C00000 tons of goods,
The couees,loa is for a term of 84 years ; It includes a branch line up the Valley of the Lahin, which will start from lahLsetein on the Rhine, and extend to thc eastern frontier of thie Ducby of hasetas, there to meet the Prussian line from Gle.esen. The Latbn district is rich in mninerals and it. existing trade is sufficient to supply a large and yeintneratUve traffe to the railway,
UkThe first eight mailes of this branch have been nearly Completed Itrom Iah stae.n to Ems) by the Nassau Goverument, Tire Coionau. islto take potsseson of these works, and to pay I per enot. oa thLsaumns

Freehold Movement In Scotland.-A move-
FREEHOLD MOEmET i SCOTLAND.-A movement was lately commenced in Edinburgh, and has since extended to other Scotch towns, having for its objects the extension of the Parliamentary franchise to theprpretors in counties of freeholds yielding a clear rental o ,as in England; the conferring on 40s. freeholders within burghs the right to vote in their respective counties; and the extension of the English ystem of rgistration to the Scottishx counties, for which a, bil wams ointrroduced last session, applicable both to burghs and counties, but which, being opposed by the Scotch county members, was then restricted to the
burghsq. Two public meetings on the subject have beenI held in Edinburgh, addressed by the Rev. Dr. Begg, a Fr!ee Church clergyman, Mr. Doncan M'Laren, and other leaders of the movement and at the last meeting of the Towncouncil resolutions -were carried, vvithotut a division, in favour of the objects sought, though severl members recorded their dissent from thie proposal to introduce freehold burgh votes into the county representation. The movement is promoted ch.iefly by the " advanced "1section of the Liberal party, who, being generally favourable to a large extension of the suffrage, desire to equalize the privileges of the franchise in England anxd Sotfland, as well as altimately to secure a wider basis of representation. The deign has also been very openly expressed that by means of the freehold system the Conserative influtence which ~revalls in about three-fourths of the counties of seotland shlould be overbalanced, not by the rural, but the burgh freeholders The change is li-ewiso advocated as an important means of woial elevation of the working classes; and a deputation from Birmingham and London is at present on a. Scottish tour explaining thu
oprtion and results of the freelhold land societies esat-
or'ished of late years in some of the English midland
counties. The movement has alreadY elicited aconsiderable amount of opposition, both from the Conservative and Whig organs, oiffhese grounds, amnong otherss, that the burgbs are not called upon or entitled to agitate for any change in the repre-sentation or registration of the counties, and that the
grnigof county votes to burgh freeholders would swata Itheirrepresentation.Variousother questions-bavebeentmixW .up with the, present agitation, such iLs the small prop)or. tionate share of burgh representation which ScotlandenDioys as comnpared with her counties and as compared with Eng. land an~ Ireland; her small share in the aggegate reprosentation of the united idngdom, &c, ; but it is understood that action will in the meantime hs limited to bringin -before Parliament a mneasure to accompIlsh the three objec`t *farst alluded to.

Lord Adolphus Vane Tempest, M.P., And "The Staff Officer."
LORD ADOLPHUS VANE TEMPEST. M.P., AND
"THE STAFF OFFICER."
Lord Adolphus Vano Tempest, M.P., who it will b3 remembered was with his regiment in the Crimea in the winter of 1854, has been relating his experience of that sad season in the Athenmum, at Durham, Professor Ohavalier, of the university of that city, occupying tho chair. During the course of his lecture the gallaut member directed attention to a book that has recently been published under the title of Ex:pericnccs of a Staff Gficer. This book, he had been told, had created a a great sensation in fashionable circles; but, for his own part, having read it himself, he could state that he did not xnowa more complete exemplification of the fable of the " daw in borrowed plumes.' The book contained a great deal of most fulsome eulogy of Lord Raglan, which, though an evidence of gratitude, was by no means a token of dliscretion. This gentleman, whowas no doubt comfortably provided for at head-quarters, was pleased to give the BrItish army some advice-and that was, to make the best of everything. In one place he spoke of the bad weather, and after expressing his thankfulness that he was not to be sent out, the "Staff Officer" stated that he was about to take possoion of a smith's shop. The position of the Staff Officer" was cortainly a moro desirable one tban that of the regimental officer or the private soldier, who had not the chance of taking possession of a smith's 8hop; but they took the advice of the writer and made the best of it. Again, the "Staff Officer" described the state of the trenches, which he said were so full of wet and mud that it was impossible to wade through them; but the regimental officers and men had to wade through them, and be in them, not for hours, but for whole nights, and thoy "made the best of it." Further, the "Staff Officer" stated that, on vsiting the hospitals in December, Lord Raglan declared them to be in as good order as circumstances could admit o£ Good order I Did Lord Raglan call it good order when some of our men were lying ill of brain fever, without so much as a blister to be apphed to their heads-when others were suffering under the worst forms of dysentery without proper drinks to assuage their thirst-and when the only alloviations to their sufferings were obtained from a source which, withont meaning any reflection upon the parties who had promoted it, he must say England had no right to be dependent on -healluded to Th7 TimesFund. Thelecturerthen statod that about thoperiod referredto a vesselcallel the Paramattawas lnng at Balaklava, and she received a cargo from the John aLasterman, that cargo consisting of spirits, wine, mademeats and soups, hospital beds and stretchers, and various other things that, if rendered available at once, might have been instrumental in saving hundreds of lives. Having refferred to some other passages in the " Staff Officer's" experience, the lecturer remarked that it was evident the writer had never had green beans served out to him to make coffee of, or to dig his own roots for firewood, through ground covered with two or three feet of snow, and with a bad pickaxe. Head-quarters were warmer than the soldiers' tents, or the "Staff Offiosr" would have had some different experiences to write about. From his own (Lord Adolphus') experience, the regimental system was that which stood the severest test. He saw the head-quarter system fail, the commiseariat system fail, the transport system fail, and every department of the army fail, except the regimental department, and he believed that the so&tliers in the army would willingly bear their testimony to the fact that the regimental officers had done their duty from the time they went out to the period of their return, they having acted up to the advice of the " Staff Officer" and made the best of everything, getting the men to ao the same. The lecturer now proceeded to refer to letters written by him during his stay in the Crimea. The first of these contained an account of his arrival at Balaklava, and some allusions to the then recent battle of Inkermann, and others showed the state of the army before SebastopoL From these it appeared that the English army was defioient in almost everything they required. The officers were not so badly off as the men, because they were enabled by means of money to obtain proper food, though at enormous prioes, and had clothes to cover them; but the men in the ranks were in the most destitute condition. As there was nothing like the argumsstuin ad hominien in theso matters, the lecturer put a case to his audience. How, he asked, would any gentleman present, who was accustomed to go home to his comfortable cup of coffee, like to have a few green coffee berries given to him, and be told to dig some roots from frosty ground with a bad pickaxe, and then make a fire and prepare his own coffee t (Laughter.) Such was the case of the English soldier in the Crimea. After 24 hours' work he had a bit of salt pork, a biscuit, and some coffee berries given to him. The pork he threw away, and after a considerable amount of manual labour he succeeded in getting some roots and in roasting his coffee, with which he made a cup of coffee, or rather discoloured beverage. Lord Raglan was seldom seen out, and one of his aides-de!amnp happened to hear by accident that the men were having green coffee served out to them. This was reported to Lord Raglan, and Lord Raglan sent for the CommissaryGeneral and made a great disturbance; but it was quite by chance that he heard of it. He (the lecturer) had frequently seen the men bruismg the roasted berries between stones, and a mill that had been sent to him by a friend, though probably not bought for more than 2s., was really invaluable. There had been a great deal of discussion as to whether the Governmeat at home or the authorities in the Crimea were to blame for the evils to which he had alluded. His own opinion was that a great part of the evil was owing to the expedition having been sent out at so late a period withont sufficient provision in the first instance, and at the same time he dia not think that so much had been done by the authorities in the Crimea as ought to have been aono. (Hear, hear.) There were three great evils from which the British army suffered;-One was the issue of green coffee, another was the absence of fresh meat, and the third was the want of bread. He had always held that each of these evils could have been easily remedied by the exercise of the smallest amount of ingenuity or invention on the part of the authorities. With reference to coffee, there was no difficulty in the way of organizing roasting and crushing establishments at Balaklava, where fuel was to be had in abundance, and it would have been as easy to have sent the coffee out roasted as in its green state. (Hear, hear.) Then, as to bread, there was no reason why bakeries should not have been established, inasmuch as there were bakers in every regiment, and many of the houses in Balaklava had ovens. The French met with no obstacles on either of these points, and the French army was regularly supplied with bread, and coffee was served out to the men that had been roasted and crushed. Then, as to fresh meat, there was no earthly difficulty in the way of obtaining an efficient and regalar supply. There were many steamers lying for weeks and months in Balaklava harbour that might have been employed in the conveyance of live stock for the use of the troops. One of these ships he mentioned on account of its name; it was called te Propeller, but for two months it lay in the harbour and never once propelled anything. (Laughter.)
GALE OF WIND AT MALTA.-Our advices from
GALE OF WiND AT MIALTA.-OUr advices from Malta to the 8th of January announce mnch damage to the many ships in port, windbound and under average, from a sudden gale of wind which came on on the afternoon of New Year's-day, blowing a perfect hurricane all night, and with but little abatement unti' the forenoon of the 2d. During the height of the gale the wind was from E.N.B., and the barometer fell from 2994 to 29'15, the thermometer ranging between 470 to 52', heavy rain falling nearly all the time. At the very commencement of thealale a small pleasure boat got swamped by the sea and foundered off the Jews' Sallyport, by wMhich disaster James Warren, a stoker, and William Smitb, a quartermaster of the gunboat Faney, met with a watery grave; two Maltese boatmen (father and son), who were in the same boat, were saved. The gunboat Cracker, lying in the Eliema Creek, dragged her anchors and grounded, but was got off without damage by the Recruit and the Fancy, wbich kept their steam up. The Neapolitan brig Ferdinand, with suphur, was wrecked on the rowder Magazine Point, and the brig Alacrity, with Indian corn from the Danube, knocked her bottom out and suffered such other serious damage that her cargo, with the exception of about 300 quarters, has been condemned, and will be sold under the authority of the Commercial Court. The Mehemet All, a French ship, laden with deals, from Trieste, bound to Algiers, was dashed to pieces on the coast of Gozo LCaptain Callamoro and one hand lost. Thbe ,steamer Brenda had her bowsprit carricd away, besides :other damages. The Dutch galliot Wilbelmina also sustained much damage, and was at one time in great danger. 1m fact, tcarcely a dozen out of some 200 vessels in-port ihave escaped rnffering zame damage or other, and it is sup. posed tbat 12,0001. will not cover the -loses. The soldiers' huts on Fort Manoel IsWand, facing Sliema, were blown away, and several of the inmates more or less hurt. Some small tenements in the vil17ges were also knocked doni by Pthe violence of the-windand-rain.

The Affair At Canton.
THE AFFAIR AT CANTO.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TTIMES.
Sir,-Now that we appear to be once more embarked in a war with China, that portion of the press and of the public which acts upon the maxim that " whatever is is wron,'" has found no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that, according to the publisbed despatches, we are all in the wrong on this occasion also, and that in the matter of the Arrow, which led more immediately to the outbreak of hostilities, the right is entirely on the side of the Chinese, this country being flagrantly in the wrong.
I trust to be able to show conclusively, on the strength of the same despatches, that this opinion is utterly erroneous, that the course pursued by our authorities in China was the only course that could be pursued with a due regard to the honour of England, and that the contrary opinion is based upon a palpable misapprehension of the whole question at issue. The matter is in all respects of so grave a character that it cannot be too clearly explained.
Under the Hongkong colonial law (as approved by the Queen in Council) aU vessels owned by briti-h subjects or by Chinese holding long leasea of land in the colony may be registered as Britisel vessels when engaged in the coasting trade with China on giving the proper securities and forms, and are then entitled to carry the British flag and to all the privileges of British ships, one of lhich is that under the 9th article of the suppl3nentary treaty with China, Chinese criminals and Chinese subjects on board of them can only be arrested by the Chinese authorities through the intervention of the British ConsuL These licenses are granted frora year to year, and are annually renewable. The now notorious Arrow was a vessel furnished with one of these licenses, dated September 27, 1855, and expiring September 27, 1856, or 11 days before the outrage committed by the Chinese in seizing all her crew.
I will not stop to inquire whether the Arrow had left Hongkong for Canton before her license expired, as the deskatches do not show this. But if it should prove, as is very likely the case, that she had, and that she sailed under the protection of our flag, and moreover intended, as is probable, to renew her license on her return to Hongkong (the only place where she could procure it), I apprehend that the British protection under which she sailed would remain by her till her return, even in a legal point of view. Morally there can be no question that it would, and that our authorities were perfectly justi. fled in applying the article of the treaty to her case, as a " British ship," in the true meaning and intent of the phrase.
But let this pass, and let us exaniine the question as it stands in the despatches, and by Yeh's own admission.
Now, nothing can be clearer from beginning to end than that Yeh believed the Arrow to have a British register. His letters contain this admission over and over again. His very first communication, dated October 10, states that Loo-Aching obtained a (British) register for her, through the firm of Block, of Hongkong, om the verry day that shte wvas conpleed, and he even adds that it cost $1,000. His subsequent letter of October 14 repeats the same account. Further on he tells us that his officers, when they boarded her, " were not aware that s.hie was a foreign lorcha." It is true that at first he began by insisting that she was a Chinese vessel, but this was entirely on the ground that she was built and owned by Chinamen, and therefore could not be foreign. But our Hongkong Government had already shown that she could, and had given her the right to bear the British fag for the year that had just expired.
It is therefore established by Yeh's own evidence that he knew that from the day of her being launched she had borne the British flag. It is also certain that he was not aware of the expiration of the license a few days before the outrage, as the circumstance is not once referred to by him throughout the correspondence; and, in fact, as7 the vessel continuedto carry the British flag, he could have no ground for supposinr,g that her position had been in any respect changed. He could not plead ignorance of the existence of our colonial law, for it appears that a translation of it had been commu[nicated to him by Her Majesty's Plenipotentiary many months previously.
Had Yeh intended to protest against our colonial law as an improper one, he was clearly bound to do so, not by such an outrage as this, but by addressing himself to the British authorities.
We therefore see that Yeh (believing the vessel to be British registered, and not knowing anything of the expiration of the license) was bound by every international obligatioR, as well as by the wording of the treaty, to arrest the suspected persons on board only through the medium of our Consul. Had he done this all the mischief that followed would have been avoided. Mr. Parkes would have discovered, on examining the ship's papers, that the license had expired, and that we therefore had no right to interfere. The result might have been very awkward for us, and the Chinese would probably have represented it as a triumph over the " outer-barbarians."
Can anything be clearer, then, than that, even if owing to the technical difficulty caused by the license having expired, the strict letter of the treaty was not violated by Yeh, he intended to violate it, and that the course he pursued was a gross and premeditated insult to the British flag
Yeh denies, indeed, that the British flac- was flyiiig at the time, but our Consul satisfied himself from the master (Mr. Kennedy) that it was; and Yeh moreover acknowledges that it was on board thevessel, another proof that he looked on the vessel as having some British rights or privileges. That the master was an Englshman nobody wiU deny.
We have, then, a vessel with a British name,with a British master, with the British flag flying, and (as far as Yeh was concerned and by his own confession) a British register; and yet we are told by some of our press that no offence was intended. Away with so un-English, so utterly untrue an assertion I
Truly is it said by one of your leading French confreres that the very persons who are now declaiming, " withmore vivacity than justice," against Sir Michael Seymour and Sir John Bowring would have been the first to clamour against them had they tamely submitted to so gross an insult to the British flag, and that England would have become the laughbing-stock of the continent if she had put up with such an outrage for the sake, as they would have said, of not injurng her tea trade just in the season.
I have in the above remarks confined myself strictly to the Arrow case. Were I to go further and explain what is notorious to every one who has been in China, or is connected with it, that the Canton Government had for a long time been systematieally evading its treaty engagements; that it treated with contempt all remonstrances, and even all friendly communications addressed to it by the treaty of Powers; and that it had set its heart on humiliating us as it has crushed the rebels, I should trespass too much on your space. All who have turned their attention to Chinese politics knew that this storm was brewing, that the cup of our forbearance was nearly full, and that very little would suffice to cause an explosion. The explosion has now come; we have the might on our side, but, still more, we have the rihJ^ on our side-the absolute, the incontestable right, not only on the great questions at issue between us and Clina, but on the small matter of the Arrow, which has brought about
tne crisis.
I will only add, in conclusion, that which all your readers may not know, but which those who have friends in China do know-viz., that Yeh, the hero of those who are fighting the battle of the Chinese in this country, has, in the short time during which he has been uovernor-General of Canton, beheaded no less than 70,000 human beings.
I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your very obedient servant.

Tuesday Evening.
Ihe quotation of gold at Paris is about 6 per mille premium, and the short exchange on London is 25.224 per 11. sterling. On comparing these rates with the English Mint price of 31. 17s. 10id. per ounce for Istandard gold, it appears that gold is nearly 4-10ths per cent. dearer in Paris than in London..
By advices from Hamburg the price of gold is 423 per mark, and the short exchange on London Is 13.2k per 11. sterling. Standard gold at the English Mint price is therefore nearly 9-lOths per cent. dearer in Hamburg than in London.
The course of exchange at Newr York on London for bills at 60 days' sight is 108i per cent., which, as ccmpared with the Mint par between the two countries, shows that the exchange is nommially against England. But, after making allowance for charges of transport and difference of interest, the present rate leaves no profit on the transmission of gold either way between the two countries.
The English funds opened heavily this morning at the depressed prices of yesterday, but some purchases on the part of the public caused the market to close with a better tone. Consols for money were first quoted W3g to i, and the last transactions were at 934 to i for money and 931 to 7 for the 5th of February. Bank Stock left off at 216 to 218; Reduced, 937 to 94; New Three per Cents., 94* to i; rdia Stock, 219 to 221; Exchequer-bonds, 98 toU9*; and India-bonds and Exchequer-bills, 2s. discount to 2s. premium.
In the Stock-Exchange to-day there was an increased supply of money, and the rate for short loans on Government securities was 5 per cent. In the discount-market and at the Bank of England the demand was moderate.
Foreign securities have been quiet, with a moderate amount of business. In Turkish the dealings in the Six per Cents. for money have been at 95; and in the Fotir per Cents. Guaranteed for money at 103, and for the account at 103k and i. Thegeneral transactions comprised-Brazihan Five per Cents., 3 01 ; Ecuador New Consolidated, 14 ; New Granada Active, 21 ; the Deferred, 6g; Mexican Tbree per Cents., 21t; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 78; Portuguese Three per Cents., 44; Russian Four-and-a-Elalf per Cents. Small, 97; Spanish Three per Cents. New Deferred for account, 23k; the Certificates of Coupon not funded 54 per cent.; Swedish, 85; Venezuela, 35f and i; the Deferred, 14k; and Dutch Two-and-a-alf per Cent., 65.
In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates generally -were about the same as last post.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were, 68f. 5c. for money, and 68f. 20c. for the end of the month, showing an improvement of an eighth.
A further sum of 50,0001. in gold was taken from the Bani to-day for transmission to the continent in payment for silver. As the large total of silver expected by the Atrato from Mexico is not likely to arrive before the end of the month, it is to be apprehended these purchases may continue, and thus increase the probability of a resumption of restrictions by the Bank of E:ngland.
The bar silver brought by the last West India packet La Plata has been sold to- day at 62 d. per oz., or id. beyond the price obtained for tbat by the previous packet. A slightly higher rate, however, was paid before the departure of the last Indian mail.
In addition to the regular shipments of specie to the East, considerable sums have been taken during the paEt four or five months to the Cape and Mauritius by the mail line to those colonies. The average since July has been nearly 50,0001. per month. In December the Ireland took 62,0001., and at the beginning of the present month the W. S. Lindsay 33,0001. to Mauritius alone.
At a half-yearly meeting of the City Bank this morning, Sir R. W. Carden presiding, a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum, jfee of income-tax, was declared, and the report and accountswere unanimously adopted. It was stated by the chairman that the present meetirg had been called with the view of affording the shareholders information, and that the directors were able to give a satisfactory account of the progress of the business of the establishment. This would be vouched by the course of the profits, the amrount realized in the first eleven months of operations having been 21,7901., while in the succeeding six months it had reached 20,8001. The directors propose to keep the dividend at the rate of 5 per cent., leaving the balance to be distributed in the shape of a bonus at the termination of the financial year, the whole of the preliminary expenses having already been discharged. Looking at the accounts as they actually stand, the board could, on the present occasion, have declared a dividend at the rate of 8 per cent. had they deemed it desirable. The interest paid on current and deposit accounts for the six months has been 14,9511. ln answer to questions it was stated that an appropriation of 5001. has been made on account of the building fund during the half-year, and that the directors have had under consideration the question of an increase of capital. A further issue of shares to the extent of 1,500 may take place in the course of the year, which, added to the 225,0001. already raised, will make a total of 300,0001. paid-up, or a nominal capital of 600,0001. The whole discussioll was of a congratulatory character, and votes of thanks to the directors, manager, and auditors (the latter of whom were stated to have nmade a most searching investigation) were inmmediately passed. Subjoined is an abstract of the report, &c.
"The directors have pleasure in meeting the proprietors, believing that it will be agreeable to them, at the present time, to receive a report of the progress of the bank for the last six months, although the deed of settlement does not require the directors to convene half-yearly meetings. The accounts of liabilities and assets and profit and loss now submitted show that, after deducting current expenses, a proportion of building expenses, making ample provision for bad and doubtful debts, and also after allowing interest to the amount of 14,9511. 3s. 3d. on current and decosit accounts, the directors are enabled to declare a divi=end for the half-year ending the 31st December last, at the rate of 5I. per cent. per annum, free of income-tax, and to carry forwaid the sum of .3,7421. Jos. Td. to the profit and loss new account, to be dealt with on the 30th June next, that being the termination of their financial year. The direotors, under the conviction that the success of the bank mainly depends upon its being so conducled as to secure public confidence, have, during the past half-year, increased the amount of its available securities by further purchases of Exchequer-bills. The low rate of interest these securities bear as compared vwith that which has been current in the money-market, and the present low price at which they are valued in the annexed account, have necessarily diminislhed the amount of profit; nevertheless, the directors doubt not that the course -which they have adopted will nieet approval. The City Bank was admitted to the Clearing-house on the 1st October last.,,

At ahalf-yearly meeting of the St. Katharine Dock Companvfleld to-day, Ms. J. W. Cater presiding, a dividend was declared at the rate of 44 per cent. per anntum, free of income-tax, and the report and accounts were adopted. It was explained by the chairman that the business of the docks continues to be steadily developed, and that the outlay for works has produced a favourable result. Since 1850 the public have received benefit to the extent of 60,( 00!. from a rednction in charg and th. policy of thedirectorw, while encouragingtrafe, I istomaintaina steadydividuid. One ortwoproprietoraobjetedtotLh rate of distribuiion, coaidering that it might safely be raised to 4; per cent., fr0e of ineomotax, or S per cent. lw sixeome-taxi, a the pfoapect of the company are gradually impeoring, l the rese re liha reached 66,000l. To tes tho opinioix of the
mneeting aru amendment to thisi effect wa5 propo5ed, but it was negatived, by a large majority. lin the coruse of the proceeding3 it was agreed, in accordance with the recoituendation of the directors, to appropriate out of revenue the further aum of 32,7251. towards the cost of the various additional buildings and improvements lately completed ancd now in progress. Annexed is an abstract of the report:-
.IThe accounts of receipt and expenditure of the company show that during the yeanr ended the 31s of December last the gross earnings have been 306,45U.; and the expendituire, incluing interest, 203,5631.; leaving net earnings 102,81. Outt of this amount a dividend was declared at the general meeting in July last at the rate of 2 per cent. (free of-income-tax) upon the capital stock of the company, and the directors recommend that a dividend of the like amount be now declared for the half-year ended the 31st of December last. Since the half-yearly general meeting in July the court of directors have given their anxious consideration to the subject of the adaitions and improvements undertaken during the last five years, and to the apportionment of the cost of the same to the several accounts of capital and revenue. They find that the sums disbursed for those improvements, together with the outlay which will be further required for completing the same, amount to 172,0061., towards which the proceeds of the Eaydon-square property, and the amounts resolved at former mneetings to be written off from earnings to the cost of new works, have provided 34,8751, leaving the sum of 137,131 to be now dealt with. On careful ivestigation of the expenditure on the improvements in qurestion the directors have come to the conclusion that it will he sound policy to appropriate out of revenue a further sum of 32,72al. to these works, carrying only the baLance, 104,405t., to the capital account; and as they consider it preferable, and more in accordance with the opinions expressed byroprietors at previous meetings, that the former sum geh e so appropriated at once out of the rest, instead of portions thereof being written off the earnings of future half-years, they have directed the accounts to be prepared accordin"ly, anticipating that this course wiU have full approval. fhe balance brought forward ou the lst of January, 1856, after providing for the dividend paynble for the preceding halfyear, was 88,8101.; adding to1tbat sum the net earnngs of the paSt year, and deducting therefrom 43,6451., the dividend declared in July last, te'ether with 5,0001. then appropriated totthe cost of new works, and 32,7251. now written off from the rest for the same purpose, gives an available balance of 110,3281. After payment of the dividend now recommended there wiU remain a balance or rest of 66,6821.
T l'he following is a comparative statement of the quantities of goods landed in these docks during the years 1854, 1855, and 1856 respectively, and of goods in warehouse at the close of each of those years - also of the shipping and tonnage that have entered the docks during the years named:-

The Peel R*ver Company have issued their repoit preparatory to their meeting on the 10th of February, and a dividend is recommended of is. per share. The operations of the company in live stock in the year 1855 produced a profit of nearly 17 per cent. on the 29,4801. at which it was originally purchased, and at the latest accounts this departnment was still, on the whole, going on satisfac. torily, although there had been partial damage from an unusually severe season. No new gold discoveries had taken place on the company's lands, bnt the recent rush of miners to the Rocky river, which is about 50 miles north of the company's town Tamworth, had caused a few additional license fees to be paid upon the Peel lands, the number, which was 26 in July last, having increased to 99 in Au ust, paying 11. each. The influx of population at the Bocky river was expected likewise to stimulate purchases of the company's lands, although for the moment it had diverted attention from transactions of that nature.
The East India and China Association have published a comparative statement of the number of ships, both British and foreign, with their aggregate tonnage, entered inward and cleared outward with cargo from and to places within the limits of the East India Company's charter from the 1st of January to the 31st of December, 1855 and 1856.
According to the statement of vessels entered inward the port of London shows a decrease of 40 vessels, but an increase of 9,828 tons; the difference between 866 vessels with a capacity of 488,766 tons in 1855; and 826 vessels, with a capacity of 498,594 tons, in 1856. In the case of Liverpool there is an increase of 73 vessels and 77,338 tons, the arrivals in 1855 having been 261 vessels, with a capacity of 190,534 tons; and in 1856 334 vessels, with a capacity of 267,872 tons. The return for Bristol exhibits a decrease of 10 vessels and 1,633 tons, the difference between 32 vessels, with a capacity of 13,225 tons, in 1855, and 22 vessels, with a capacity of 11,592 tons, in 1856. From the Clyde, the statistics show a decrease of 2 vessels and 1,011 tons, the arrivals in 1855 having been 35 vessels, with a capacity of 14,721 tons; and in 1856, 33 vessels, with a capacity of 13,710 tons. The net increase presented by a review of this statement is 21 vessels and 84,522 tons, the arrivals in 1855 having been 1,194 vessels, with a capacity of 707,246 tons, and in 1856 1,215 vessels with a capacity of 791,768 tons. The principal increase in arrivals has been in vessels from Calcutta, Mladras, and the Cape of Good Hope.
The statistics of vessels cleared outward present in the case of the port of Londos an increase of 53 vessels and 50,079 tons; the difference between 681 vessels with a capacity of 431,692 tons, in 1855, and 734 vessels with 481,771 tons in 1856. In the case of Liverpool the increase is 39 vessels and 45,436 tons, the departures in 1855 having been 465 vessels witb a capacity of 380,484 tons; and in 1856, 504 vessels with a capacity of 425,920 tons. The return for Bristol shows a decrease of five vessels and 1,022 tons, the difference between 13 vessels with a capacity of 7,986 tons in 1S55, and eight vessels with a capacity of 6,964 tons in 1856. The figures for the Clyde exhibit a decrease of three vessels, with an increase of 2,449 tons, the departures in 1855 having been 107 vessels, with a capacity of 62,899 tons, and in 1856, 104 vessels, with a capacity of 65,348 tons. The total net increase of vessels cleared outward appears by this statement to be 84 vessels, and 96,942 tons; the difference between 1,266 vessels, with a capacity of 883,061 tons, and 1,350 vessels, with a capacity of 980,003 tons. The principal increase is in the departure of vessels for Bombay, China, New South Wales, and the Cape of Good rEope.
The Stornaway has arrived from Shanghai in the Downs with 3,657 bales of silk, and 192,2001b. of tea.

To The Editor Of The Times.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMfES.'
Sir,-I wish to recall ptblic attention to the Falkland rslands as a penal settlement. My motive for doing so is that I think the pablio mind is earnestly bent on discovering some place of transportation for our convicts, some methol of eliminating the convict element from the atmosphere which it is now so frightfully poUnting. Ly reason for obtruding my own views on publc attention is because among all the letters and suggestions which I have seen in the papefs on this subject there is not one proposal that has yet found favour with the public, nor one that is not open to fatal objections-Vauconver's Island, on account of the enormous length of the voyage and the proximity to California; Hudaon's Bay, from the simple fact that con'icts could never maintain themselves there, and must consequently be maintained by us; the northern coast of Australia, from its sterile character and tropical situation; the Hebrides, from their too great proximity to home.
Western Australia, whither they are at present sent, is also objectionable from its very limited power of per. manently absorbing them, the country for many miles back being nothing but a sandy waste, and free settlers sent there being unable to find employment; the consequence Will be that the convicts, as they become free, either must continue a burden on the country or will find their way to the goldfield and this the gold colonies wilU not tolerate. More. over, it has been shown in evidence (Ist Report on Transpor. tation, 1856, q. 3,911) that eaoh con-cte sent there has cost this country more than 1,000., 3,900 having cost upwards of 400,0001., the appetite of that little colony for convicts being so insatiable as to crave for 700 per annum at a Cost to us of 70,0001., and yet withal so dainty as utterly to eschew and repudiate women, boys, and Irishmen; that is to say, it is willing to take any number of full-grown Englishmen, whose labour is worth at the least from 301. to 40 per annum per man, if we will pay a premium of 100D. and odd with each. Surely this is a hard bargain for us. I hope, Sir, if you ! ill give me space, to show that we have it in or power by a well-framed plan of organization, to found a purely penal settlement, which shall be calculated to form the germ of a great and valuable colony.
That it may not be considered a piece of mere prosump. tion in mo to have addresed myself to this task, I must premise that I have visited the penal settlements of Van Diemen's Land and Norfolk Island, the latter while stiU a penal settlement, for the express purpose of obtaining some insight into the subject; and Ihaveomittedno opportunity of making myself acquainted with the habits and tendencies of the various classes of convicts congregated in those regions. My experience has led me to the conviction that they are more susceptible of good influences than is popularly be. lieved; that, under due incentives and with fitting 6pportunities, a large proportion of them are capable of becoming and do become respectable members of socioty; and that there is no inherent impossibility in a community of con. victs growing up into a well-ordered commonwealth. The essentials for this are a due mixturo of the sexes, a snail. cient space for expansion, and a proper primary or. pnization.
The first needs no comment. The second I believe to be abundantly furnished in the Falkland Islands, with the resources which the neighbouring coasts afford. These I wiU first endeavour to point out, and then proceed to describe the organization which I propose for the settlement. And here I must remind you that Lord Grey, than whom probably no one is more conversant with the subject, has given his evidence most strongly in favonr of these islands as a place of transportation. (Ist Report on Transportation, 18i6, qq. 1,696 to 1,749.) And I find that in much that I have to urge I have been anticlpated by his Lordship, and yet, singular as it appears to me, public attention seems now to be altogether diverted from this land of promise.
I wiU not, however, quota his Lordship, or any favour able witness, I wiiU rather take the evidence of an oppo nent-
"Fas est et ab hosts doceri."
Mr. Elliott, examined before the committee of last year, says (qq. 521 to 26):-
" Some military settlers were sent to the FalklandIslands, and though they are able just to live in tolerable comfort, we do not hear of their amassing wealth. An old soldier makes but a poor farmer." Again,-"I think they coald barely raise the m eans for their subsistence and no more. The Falklands constitute a very poor and languishing set. tlement. The old soldiers just live there and no more. It is an inhospitable cUmate, extremely boisterous. Corn to grow there must be carefuUy sheltered."
lotit be granted that it is an inhospitable climate, such a climate is the very one best adapted for convicts. A rude and boisterous climate will stimulate their energies, will compel them to exercise and labour, to keep the life-blood circulating in their veins. It seems that it is not considered too inhospitable a climate for pensioning our military settlers upon; but our pot convicts, the darlings, must be nursed in the luxurious lap of some soft and genial clime. Never, Sir, was a more fatal mistake made than that of sending large numbers of one sex exclusively to a warm luxurious climate -to a zone in which the animal passions run riot. The evil consequences, one would have thought, had boen safficiently apparent in the earlier history of Norfolk Island, and yet so little impressed do statesmen appear to be with the real cause of those frightful evils that they are even now longing for the discovery of an advantageous site in some tropical region, such as the north coast of Australia, Moreton Bay, &c., and are actually sending men alone in thousands to the torrid climate of Western Australia, a country in which the thermometer positively ranges in summer higher than in most parts of India, and where, of course, the inevitable consequences are already appearing. (See q. 1,574.)
To proceed with our text.
It is a Tery poor and languishing settlement; the old soldiers just manage to live there, *nd no more.
Q. 52L-They are able just to live there in tolerable comfort, &c.
Very well, they are able to gain a livelihood, and whero an old soldier wil just manage to live a convict will thrive. The convict is a much more energetic man as far as regards self-maintenancoe than the old soldier; the contrast in Australia and Van Diemen's Land is perfectly notorious. I have visited soveral of tho pensioners' settlements thero, and never found one of them doing reore than living from hand to mouth, while many and many a convict, onceo turned adrift in the colony withoat a fraction, now possesses his thousands of acres of land and tens of thousands of sheep.
It wil not grow corn. No ; but it grows potatoes to perfection. Its humid climate is favourable to aU kinds of esculents; it produces spontaneously the Tussack grass, which feeds large herds of the finost wiUd cattle, whoso hides are an article of rapidly-increasing value; it pastures herds of wild horses and droves of pigs. A country which yields subsistence to the military pensioners, and which enables cattle, horses, and pigs to increase and multiply, is not to be despised. It possesse peat in abundance for fael, and a bush which burns while green; the fresh sod for raising temporary shelter, and, there can be no donbt, clay for more permanent buildings. Though corn does not ripen wel, yet oats, in all probability, would succeed; and what more do we want? Are not these all the elements which have for ages supported a dense population in Ireland and tho Western Highlands? Bat these are not their only reeources. Tho neighbouring coasts of Magellan's Straits abound in seals of the largost species and in whales and swarm with fish. Nor are these valuable fisheries likely to be soon exhausted, for the vast submarine forests of woed (which grows there to the length of 60 fathoms) afford a shelter and refuge which protect them from wholesale destruction. Another inexhaustible sourc of wealth and prosperity exists on the neighbouring coasts of Tierra del Fuego, which are clothed with the largest description of timber, down to the water's edge. Here is a resource for ship building and also for maintaining a supply of timber for refitting ships, and this leads me to the great value of these islands ia a national point of view.
Corsider how large a part of the commerce of the world is now continually passing withing 100 miles of the eastern Falkland. There are aU the homeward-bound ships from Australia, Van Diemnen's Land, and New Zealand, from the Pacific Islands, and the Great Southern whale fisheries, and all the outward as weU as homeward trade both of Europe and America to California, Lima, and Valparaiso, and a very large-proportion of these are passengerships. Now, the Pantof aport for refittingin the neighbourhood of Cape Horn is most severely felt. The Falkland Islnds possess the most splendid and secare harbours that can be desired; and if any facilities for refitting were afforded many a gallant ship, tempest tossed off the Horn, or unable to weather, from the eastward, that formidable cape, would dombtless take shelter there. For this purpose it would bo necesmry, as Lord Gray has pointed ont, to form a dock in Berkeley or Choisul Sound; and this single work, I don't hositato to say, would be of the greatest national importance, while it would lay the foundation of success and prosperity to the oolony. It is estimated that a ship going in there for ropairs or refreshment would save from 10 days to a fortnight as compated with the loss of time involved in going into Rio; but this is tho least part of it. Imagine a ship di&sasted off the Horn; how is she to get to Rio? Whilo the Falkland Islands even a disabled ship could generally reach with the prevailing S.W. winds, We have gono to great expense in carefully surveying the coasts And harbours of ijesoislandi.

Sips that touched there would gladly pay highly for freah supplies Tho homeward-bound passenger ships from the

I maintain, then, that the FaLkands, vith their various and abon. dant resources, aro capable of providing for a very large population. They are not of the inconsiderable extent that is generally imagined; their length from E. to W;'i.s 1
miles by 60 from N, to S. According to Mr. Darwin they are more than half the extent of Ireland. Their position on the globe is another most favourable circnnmunce. They are not in the neighbourhoody of any civilize cotutry, and the planting of convicts therecouldnotgive risoto ingry remonstrances or complaints from any foreign Power or colony of our own. The escape of prisoners thence' need not be apprehended, for if they landed on Patagonia they must starve. The distance from England also i3 jast wha, it should be-only half that of Australia, and the cost of transport consequently proportionably less, while it is sufficiently remote both for ourselves and our colonies.
The plan of colonization which I propose is a very uimple one. I would offer to the ticket-of.leave men, and to the far more formidable class of expiroes who ire daitlybeiun turned loose upon society, a pqsage to theso islands, and a few acres of land upon arriving there, with seed and implements, which should give them no excuse for not-oulti. vating their lots; I would also offer thom a fair rite of wages on the docks and the Tery few public works ?rhich would be requiredl; I would at the same time inform-them that unless they could show a fair prospoct of employment in this country their rejection of such favourable term5 would expose them to suspicion, and Would recommend them to the particuar attention of the police. I would encourage their taking out wives with them in the first instance, and, of courso, pay the women's psage; but as soon as proper buildings could be qrOtd and4 som organization established, I would send out the tchole of our women prisoners; for women areas necessary to our infant colony as they were to the very dimilarly-coustituted one of early Bomo; and our present inability to sendout the femaleprisoners isacknowledged to be an evil of the greatest magnitude; nay, great as is the evil of rtaiinjg men in the country after tho expiration of thoir sentence, tho retention of women is considered by competent tuthorites to be a stil greater evil, both to themselves and the
1ommunity. (See Colonel's Jebb's evidence, quesioz 1,459.) Of course, these women should be xubjected to ab Oertain penal servitude and then allowed to marry. In casothese terms should be thought too favourable for ticket-of£leave men and expirees, it must be-brnoe in mind that we want to get rid of these people; we annot drive them Away; thereforo we must in a, inanner bribe them. I propose, in addition to the 'expirees and ticket-of-leave men, to send out a certain number of those whose penal entence has yet a year or a year and a- half to run, in order that Government might have a certaln amountoflabour to depend on forthe construction of the dock. which should be pushed forward with the utmost rapidity, and such of this class whom Government might not abso. lutely requiro, or who might not be strong enough for this kind of work (those, for instance, who wouldbe draughted out from Dartmoor), I would lend tothose of the freo class whose conduct should justify toe belief that they might be intrusted with the charge, in order to assist them in breaking up their land, &c., the prisoners, of course, returning at night to the custody of Government. This assignment system I would extend as opportunity offered, and make it a prinoipal feature of the scheme, for I believe it would have a doubly beneficial effect on the employers and the employ6s. Give a man ever so little property and repose confidence in him, and you go a long way towards reforaing. him. besides, I consider that the competition for this labour would be great, and would operate as a restriction on its abuse. On the other hand, the employ6 would. bo learning, in the service of another, the kind of labour wlvoh he would look forward soon to exercise for his own benefit. I would by no means exclude the pensioners who ar there from the benefit of this assignment system, but by allowing them to share in it enlist their sympathies in the success of the settlement. The inveterate militaryhabits which indispose old soldiers for a life of labour by no ineans unfit them for the position of masters and for the eharge of convicts. At the same time I would let it be distinctly understood from tho first that this is to be for ever a penal colony, and those pensioners who might grumble at the change should be compensated for their improvements and removed elsewhere. I would send out Jron barracks for the prisoners, as these involve no waste of time in erecting, and when surrounded with sods would be warm and secure enough. The free people might remain on board the ships until they had erected their own abodes. The getting in of the eed as early as possible would, of course, be of paramount importance, and fortunately it could be soon effected, for the breaking up of In open countryis avery difforent processfrom thelaborious and tedious operation of clearing a primeval forest.
For the construction of tho docks I would depend on an engineer, with a party of Sappers and Miners to direct the works, rather than on a great contractor, who would require time to make the inquiries on which to found his estimates. Time is precious, and I Would fit out a great expedition as soon as might be of some of thoso ships lying in ordinary, which could so wel be spared, contemplating the probability of their detention for a considerable time, perhaps altogether, as hulks; and, though I well know that the name Of hulks is a bugbear, still the advantages of them for our purpose are 80 obvious, and the improvements which might be made in their arrangements also, I think, sa obvious, that I do not hesitate to mention them. I believe that a single sloop of war, with a party of marines, would be a sufficient force for the maintenance of order without the presence of troops, whom we can so il afford.
It is said that Government have granted some peculiar privileges to a Fuegian mission now established on East Falkdand, butI cannot bolieve that it has thereby precluded itself from making use of this fine island for Imperial purposes. I would rather hope that we might reckon on the aidof the missionaries to assist us in thisenterprise.
These, Sir, are my views of the advantages which the Falklands present over all other places in the world for a penal colony. I believe, in fact, that it is the only possible place that remains for a penal colony, and, s such, that it should be occupied at once. My letter has run to a considerable length, and yet, in order to abride it, I have suppressed many considerations which I had wished to urge.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

liNDON. WEDNESDAY, JAR UABY 21, 1857.
England has a very strong constitution. We don't mean its political constitution,-that we leave to speechmnkers and bookwriters. We mean its constitution in the same sense as when we say that such a man has the constitution of a home, which, by the way, is not so strong as a man's. But a man may be said to have a good constitation, when he survives the yellow fever, or 35 fevers, like Dr. LmvINosrN; or half a century of tropical suns and brandy and water, or of evening parties and green tea, or a dozen wounds; when he can point to the place where, 20 years ngo, a spear or a gig shaft went in at one side and out at the other; or where from that period he has carried a bullet or two in his body. In this sense England has a good working constitution, a most
elcellent physique. So don't be alarmed, gente reader, timid reader, when we inform you that a Socialist Parliament, the very like of that. installed nine years ago in the Palace of the Luxembourg, is now sitting from time to time on the great historical site of Smithfield. It sits there not without authority. His Majesty the LoBD MAYoR, though he has not opened the session in person, has done so by commission; that is, by permission. Several thousands assemble, and the speakers talk Communism of the boldest character. They are not disturbed. No cordon of troops surrounds the market; no collision is expected or provoked ; nobody anticipates a fusillade in Giltspur-street, a massacre in Long-lane, or an emeute in Cow-cross. There is not even a Govermment reporter on the ground. Their insatiable curiosity renders it worth the while of independent reporters to take notes; otherwise these harangues would pass into oblivion as fast as the lowing of the kine, the bleating of the sheep, and the grunting of the pigs, lately in those very enclosures. In any other metropolis a Communist Parliament would throw the whole body politic into the most frightful disorder. Obstruction, collapse, and fever, advancing from its lowest to its typhoid form, and ending in utter madness, would be the inevitable consequences. Here we can go on for months with Socialism in Smithfield just as the man lived for yeas with a dozen knives and a comb in his stomach, and just as men stiU live when their lungs are said to be gone or their livers turned to stone. The truth is, we have all discussed these theories over and over. Mlost of us have been Socialists ourselves in our time; so we know al about it, and when Mr. HOBBa s or Mr. DonBEs gets up and propounds the Socialist theory as a grand discovery of his own, we inwardly reply that we could say a good deal more for it if we only thouglht it worth while.
Apart from their testimony to the melancholy fact that there is a certain number of persons in considerable distress, what is reported of the oratory in Smithfield is of no great importance. Mr. PiBaca was the historian of the meeting. He traced the abject condition of London worknien to the time when WIL1IAM the CoNQuxnoi came over with his barbarous hordes, and reduced the people to the condition of slaves. He couceived they had a right to share in the wealth they saw accumulated about them-a theory, by the way, which lay at the bottom of the said Norman invasion. He thought that every man had a right to an equal division of property till every man 'was satisfied. They had only to find out the fulcrum and they could move the world. This gentleman was a cabinetmaker. Though a profound historian and an ingenious statist, he did not inform the meeting how many mahogany wardrobes, marqueterie cabinets, or walnut-tree tables, would remain to the share of every day labourer and coatermonger when the proposed subdivision of property had been repeated, say, only half a dozen times, and everybody had had satisfaction. Mr. MACRAY then proposed to divide among the people all the unoccupied land in the country. Whoever wanted land, let him have his fill of it. " Let them cling to the land: let "them remember the words on the fiont of the "Royal Exchange, ' The earth is the LoRD's, and " 'the fulness thereof,' for they had a right to its "fulness." Very good. The long love of land,-this " clinging" to the soil, is a generous and truly British feeling. It lies at the very bottom of our best and dearest institutions. The worthy shoemaker testified to the same feeling that animates the industry of the city merchant and the Manchester millowner. They both toil at their desks, screw at everycorner, and live-aye, sometimes die, too -in omnibuses, in order that their sons or their sons' sons may be landowners, lords of manors, territorial gentry, county magistrates, and old English gentlemen. The blood of our indigenous ancestors still flows in our veins, and we all revert to the bosom of dear mother Earth. Our only difference with Mr. MAcRAY is, that we wish rather too well for him and his friends than to put them on their ten or twenty acres -of bad land. We know what it is to have to deal with five hundred or a thousand acres of land not of the highest quality, and we don't think that Mr. MACEAY'S case would be much improved by squatting on 30 acres of 1Baggahot-heath. He 'would soon wish himself back in Smithfield, where the rainwater and the manure do not pass so directly to the bottom of the earth. Besides, what would he do for horses, cattle, implements, and other live and dead stock ? He would have to mortgage his 30 acres to Mr. LEvi, at 6 or 7 per cent. ; and jutst conveniently as his second year's crop was coming into ear he would find himself sold up and a man in possession; when, of course, he would be wanting another division of property.
MIr. MACHEATH-evidently related to the celebrated captain of that name-is a bold blade. He denounced landowners as robbers, and was for retaliating upon them. He proposed a penny subscription. The pennies were to be for two purposes,-first, to wrest land from the said robbers; then to pay for the emigration of those who might prefer a foreign land. But, Mr. MAcaniTri, there is another alternative. Every Englishman,happily, has three courses open to him, as Sir RonERT PEEL used to say. There is the home, the foreign, and the coloinil market for industry. The last speaker at the last meeting in Smithfield stated, we know not on what grounds, that there were altogether 35,000 work-people in the different trades necessary to building now out of work in this metropolis. These he made up thus; -9,000 carpenters, 4,000 plasterers, 4,000 painters, 1,000 stonemasons, 15,000 bricklayers and labourers, and 2,000 smiths, moulders, decorators, &c. Why, these are the very trades wanted in our Australian colonies. The most ordinary workmen at these trades are getting the most extravagant wages at Sydney, Melbourne, and other cities. Even in Canada these trades are short of hands. Of course, it is not our place to recommend the United States, but our correspondence from New York in our paper yesterday will show the London workman that cabinetmakers, moulders, decorators, and the highest order of workmen, are quite as much in request in New York as they ever were in London. We
cannot advise anybody to change his alegiance, but he had better do so than make a disturbance at home. In all classes those who cannot get on at home go somewhere else. This clergyman's brother, that clergyman's daughter, this country gentleman's two sons, and even some of that Bishop's famnily, have left old England for ever and settled in the antipodes. The merchant is unfortunate, and his sons try their luck in another hemisphere. Australia is full of gentlemen. University men, barristers, surgeons, and artists there keep "stores" or even stalls, tend sheep, serve as mounted patrol, and even drive carts. There are a good many at the diggings. One poor fellow who had been whitewashed in the Insolvent Debtors' Court in this country is now earning an honourable livelihood by whitewashing houses at Melbourne. Now, it will be rAther hard if the middle classes of this country have to send their unfortunate relatives to Atustralia, and yet are to be called on to mainthin, or, what is the same thing, find work for, all the artisans out of work at home. There is a homely saying, that " what is sauce for the
goose is sauce for the gander," anad Mr. MACHEAT,H'S idea of emigration strikes uis as
a very good one for all classes, particularly for those represented on this occasion. It i3 the chief resource of this colntry. We are a nation of wanderers. We have wandered into England, and if we can't live here we nzust wander out of it. Celts, or Saxons, or Normans, we have been always on the move; and, if we find ourselves in a strait, we must not stop the way, but ' move on,"
This is the true application of the text quoted by the philosophical shoemaker,-" The earth is the " LoRa's, and the fulness thereof." It was so used by the Pilgrim Fathers when they landed in New England. They added, "The LORD has given "the earth to His saints; we are His saints; "therefore, let us take possession of the "earth." So, instead of the words on the front of the Royal Exchange being an invitation to all Londoners to atay at home-to throw themselves on their parishes or seek a division of property-it is, in fact, a hint to disperse and occupy the earth and enjoy its fulness from sea to sea and from pole to pole.
Some 16 months since, when the details of the
Some 16 months since, when the details of the last struggle at Sebastopol became known, we received no little abuse from a number of incensed critics for our observations on the part played by the British Generals at the Redan. We had regretted that on September 8, as often before, the incapacity of our leaders had placed our achievements in lamentable contrast with the suCcesses of the French. The common sense and the high spirit of the English people caused all but a small minority to agree in the disappointment and disapprobation which we expressed; still, there were not wanting those -who professed to see no miscarriage in the unhappy repulse, no subject for regret in the failure of their countrymen in the crowning contest of the war. The argument of these persons, of course, was, that the several attacks were to be looked upon as one, and that we had our share in the success of the Malakhoff, and our allies their responsibility for the failure at the Redan. The usual appeal was to the French themselves. It was only T7he Timres, they said, " that pretended the "English ought to have been successful. The "Parisians, with that chivalrous feeling which "distinguishes them, gave us full credit for the
common victory. In fact, the Redan was not "meant to be taken. General SimirsoN, whose "geniusPErissixn andNiEL warmly acknowledged, "had taken a masterly view of things. i3e had "sent 1,500 men to a feigned attack. It was in "the programme that the Light Division was to be "cut up, and, with a sagacity to be found only in "the highest minds, regiments with a large propor"tion of recruits were chosen because the loss "would be of less importance to the country. The "Emperor NAPOLEON, the French army, and "French society in general, were enthusiastic at "the achievements of the brave English, which "only a few discontented and ignorant writers "at home sought to disparage." This was the reasoning of the thorough suipporters of the military magnates at home and abroad. We had said that not only in France, but throughout neutral and observant Europe, this country had lost ground by the slackness and want of spirit of the British officers in command. The calumnious assertion was indignantly contradicted. Frenchmen, Germans, and Italians, it was declared, were ful of admiration of the part played by the British force. In their superior acquaintance with the art of war they were not likely to fall into the errors of shallow critics at home. Whenever the campaign should be discussed by the French themselves ample justice would be done to the skilful English commanders, so scandalously misunderstood and misrepresented in their own country.
We have now an opportunity of testing the value of these assertions. The book of M. DE BAZANCO-urT, a semi-official performance, shows how far the French authorities are willing to give us our due even in respect to those events in which we earned a fullshareof glory. But, if any onewouldgain a just notion of the value which the French Court and army wish to place on the services of the English during the war, it is sufficient to read the official report of the banquet given the other day by Prince NAPOLEON to the general officers of the army who took part in the Crimean campaign. We in England have had Crimean banquets, and we may say that not only in the first triumph of the aliance, but even during the last few months, when diplomatic questions have somewhat divided the two nations, the tribute of respect to our allies has never been wanting. The French Generals and the French army have always been alluded to in terms of admiration, the health of the commanders has been drunk, and the mention of their names has been the signal for hearty acclamations. General DELLA MARMORA and his Sardinians, OtAR PASHA and the army which kept at bay the Russians on the Danube, have been great names at our feasts. Now turn to the French entertainment. It is the reception of the chief Crimean Generals by an Imperial Prince, himself a sharer in the campaign. It is a public affa-r, officially recorded in the Moniteur. There are present men who filled the highest posts in the French army from the beginning to the end of the war; the colleagues of Lord RAGLAN as wel as of General SnIPsoN and his successor. Addmiral HAAtELI-, the Duke Dr MALARHOFF, MIarshal CAN ROBEEIT, Marshal BosQuET, Generals REGN2AULT DS ST. JEAN D'ANGELY, Dx SALLES, NIEL, AlMAHoN, are all present. These men saw the landing at Old Fort covered by a British fleet; fought action after action in company with the British; they shared with them in the dreary labour of the trenches for 11 nonths; they saw tens of thousands of their men brought to the seat of war in British transports, and their sick carried down to the Bosphorus by the same means. They have been thanked as a body by the British Parliament, and wear severally the Order of the Bath on their breasts. Yet at this great official banqnet the English are never once mentioned. We are as much ignored as if no English soldier had set foot in the Crimea, as if no English sailor had ever entered the Black Sea. Marshal ST. ArtAUD is spoken of as having made for himsref at the Alma a windingsheet of the tricolour of regenerated France; Marshal CA."oBEnT has the praise of havina disciplined an army for the conquest of Sebastopol, and to Marshal PEtissIma is a%cribed the crown of final success. The Generals are congratulated on having renewed the glorious traditions of the Republic and the first Empire. " Posterity will "say that at Moscow our fathers vanquished the "Russians, but were overcome by the elements; "while at Sebastopol you have overcome the "elements and vanquished the Russians. In "history 1854 will respond to 181l. The im" mense advantage of the war-I say it with pride "-is that you have proved that France still has "her 'Grand Army."' Such is the speech of his Imperial Highness Prince NAroLEoN.
The two Commanders-in-Chief, Marshals PELISsiBB and CAwrosELT, return thanks, and propoie fresh toass in muich the same style. The French army, its conquest of Sebastopol, and its termination of the war, are the themes of high laudation. No other force is mentioned. No allied Generals are even remotely alluded to as sharing the glory and the untimely end of ST. AYNIuID, or. the
success and happy return to home of PxlSSOR and CAmEOBELT, NrEn and BosQuGET, We are
always hearing from a certain military set in England of the esteer W3isch Lord RAGLA?
enjoyed; how he was beloved, admired, ana deferred to by his foreign colleagues, and anecdotes innumerable are related of this fond anad chivalrous confidence. Yet here the dead English General is unnamed. Not one of the 52 guests present, not one of the band of Generals who for so many months met him in the field or at the counciltable, had a word for the memory which it has been asserted they so much cherish. Of cous, his successors are equally unnoticed.
In fact, the nwt d'ordre evidently was to suppress England, and the military failures, the last and greatest of which was at the Redan, have given a colour-false as it is-to the cavalier silence of the Palais RoyaL General SDnPsON, at the crowning struggle of the war, -was unequal to the occasion, sent an insufficient force of raw youths to assault a formidable position, was repulsed, omitted to renew the attack, and failed even to occupy the place when it was deserted. The result was that the fall of Sebastopol was mainly the result of a French exploit. The apology was, that the attack on the Redan permitted the capture of the Malakhoff, and that a chivalrous ally would not suffer our reputation to suffer. Where, now, is the chivalry ? Where is the acknowledgment of English services? The victor in the eyes of the world takes all the benefit of appearances. We may prove our merits, it we can, to a listless audience, which has already formed its conclusions, and is tired of the whole subject. Of what avail are mere eonventional rewards ? General SDMrOsN has his four grand crosses, and General CODRnecTO is placed over the heads of other Generals and covered with decorations. But these cannot alter the opinions of the world, nor restore the prestige which has been lost. What was the position our Generals had won for us we may judge by the French banquet. It was reserved for the courage of the present PnEMIIER and the patriotic resolution of the English people to insure the fruits of our joint victory, to restore the country to a leading place in Europe, and regain in the Cabinet the reputation vahich our Generals had lost us in the field.
Ding-dong, ding-dong! A bell acts upon the
Ding-dong, ding-dong ! A bell acts upon the sense of hearing by a constant repetition of one monotonous note. Now, with regard to the vexatoa questio of our convicts, and of our convict discipline, we are anxious to produce an effect upon the rate-and-tax-paying mind of the country, by humbly imitating the vibrations of Big Ben. Cost, cost, cost, is the note which we would ring into the ears of our readers until we find that our senators, and philanthropists, and DRACOS do really give some smal share of attention to the expense of executing their laws, and of putting their experiments, whether of mercy or severity, to the test of practice. We are ready to admit, as a basis of argument, the great principle of penny wise and pound foolish. The point is not to be decided by the mere figures of the balancesheet. We must consider whether the work for which we pay has been well done. At present there can be no doubt that the work has 71ot been well done. The cost of doing it iU may be understood from the following figures. In a letter which we have received from Mr. EDDY-a RADCLIFFE Travelling Fellow from the University of Oxford, and which we print to-day-the following rcsun.5 of a certain portion of the First Report on Transportation may be found -.- Each convict sent "from this country to Western Australia has cost "the country more than 1,0001-3,000 having "cost upwards of 400,0001.; the appetite of that
little colony for convicts being so insatiable as "to crave for 700 per annum, at a cost to us of 70,0001." So far for the pecuniary results of the transportation system as recently carried out. Next, foi the plan of home-punishment and the cost of that plan we turn to a conumunication made by MIr. CHARLES PIA-PsoN to the LORD MALYon, which was printed yesterday in the columns of this journal. Towards the close of this paper we find PIr. PEABoN speaking of the prison palaces and castles of indolence, "where
ablebodied men in the prime of life cost for board and lodging 301. or 401., aiid earn only 31. or 41. per annum, where they lhave labour for relaxation only, and spend their time in "qualifying themselves to deliver lectures upon a variety of subjects which it would have puzzled the Admirable CrOmisoN to deal with." Considered solely with reference to cost, MIr. PEARSON is no doubt right. We may entertain considerable doubts as to the degree of comfort experienced by prisoners to vwhom labour is a privilege and a relaxation, but what if their sufferings are entirely thrown away ? Here we have been in full fruition of separate systems and silent systems for a very considerable period, and still the country is infested with criminals, with or w^ithout tickets of leave, and we are upon the eve of a solemn discussion as to the best method of dealing with the convict calamity. Thus, the cost of BiLL SYmS, if we transport him to Western Australia, stands at just 1,0001. to the community. If, on the other hand, we elect to keep that ornament of society at home, we have to pay an annuity of 301. or 401. per annum for that moral luxury, besides the cost of re-catching and re-convicting him after liberation. In this little calculation we take, of course, no accoiut of broken eggs-that is, of all that Mr. Svaxs may have pilfered or stolen during the parentheses of his prison career. We simply regard bim as a permanent annuitant upon the budget of the country, and debit him with the charge of recaptuing his person from time to time. To these two estimates we would add the calculation of an eminent detective officer, who, whenever he saw a little urchin placed at the bar of a police-court for picking pockets, or some other juvenile ofifeice of the like kind, was wont to remark, "Ah!
that's 3001. to the counitry before we have done with you." If the preceding estimate be correct, and-little BILLY ripens into the mature Mr. WILLIA31 SYxES, whom we are in the habit of converting into a public ainuitant, or of removing to Western Australia, the worthy officer's calculation must be far below the mark.
* Wben the point is considered under the head of public security to life, limb, and property, the actual cost of our present convict disciplineextravagant as it may be-appears but a secondary consideration. The needful work, as we muaintaim, is not done well, althouglh the price of an imperfect result is very high. The system must be radically changed in one way or another. Mr. CHAnIS PEARSON is all for industrial prisons -that is, for prisons in wvhich so much b&oud fide labour shall be extracted from the convicts as shall pay for the cost of their maintenance. This plan, no doubt, recommends itself to the mind by a kind of scientific roundness and completeness. A man has violated the laws of his country, he is therefor3 sentenced to a term of imprisonment, and during that tenn he is made to give back in .labour all the charges to which the community is put upon his account. We pass over the economical objections, on the ground of interference with the regular labour of the country, which ihave been urged against this proposition. These probably have been exaggerated, and, at any rate, even if the inconvenience suggested should result, it would be ligbt in comparisotli with that Which the community must endure from the presence of an active and energetic criniinal population. Mr. PEAssoz's plan, however, which is as old as the
hill or as picking of pockets, if accepted in its 1a.impl , is tainted, to our apprehension, Iwith this defect-that, if we aaopt it, wo retain at home all our criminals, and we cannot avoid the conclusion that the most economical, the most merciful, and the most effectual manner of dealing with them would be permanently to remove them from the British shores to regions wvhere they might atand a chance of earning an honest livelihood when their terms of imprisonment had expired, and where, at least, they would not be able to carry constant terror and apprehension into the heart of a peaceful community. The worst criminals removed, we might deal in a far more lenient spirit, and with better hopes of reformation, with offenders who might yet be reclaimed.
For all this-we confess it frankly-we do most seriously object to so monstrous a charge as 1,0001. per man, for the maintenance, diet, clothing, and passage-money of these wretched convicts. The chief point of detail, supposing that we are agreed upon the question of principle, is as to the spot where our penal settlement should be established. Many places have been proposed-the territories of the Hudson's Bay Company, Vancouver's Island, and the Gulf of Carpentaria, in North Australia. Various recommendations and various drawbacks attach to each of these places, which we have separately considered. This day Mr. EDDY, whom we have already quoted, comes forward as the advocate of the Falkland Islands as the aptest spot within the domains of the British CROWNN which could be selected as a place of penal settlement. Unless his statements can be set aside, the suggestion is worthy of all attention. The selection of the Falk'and Islands as a place of deportation for our convicts would not embroil us with any foreign Government or eolony. The islands could be easily guarded, so that escape would be impossible, or nearly so. The climate is reasonably good, at any rate not detrimental to the health of Europeans. A sufficiency of produce for the support of the penal colony could, as it appears, be raised upon the islands. Finally, the cost of transporting the convicts to that spot would be far short of the old Sydney or Tasmanian calculations. We invite especial attention to Mr. EDDY'S letter.

Mr. Thackeray's Lectures.
MR. THACKERA 'S LECTURES.
If Mr. Thackeray treated the memory of George III with more lenity than might have been anticipated by all his hearers, he certainly made amends for the unexpected clemency by the discourse which he delivered last night on the subject of George IV.
In surveying the career of the so-called "first gentleman of Europe," the lecturer professed his inability to discover any single cause for respect, or any claim to the title once bestowed by the population of this kingdom. He could not even regard the lastof the Georges as a "man" in any sense. He could find a coat, a waistcoat, and divers well-made articles of clothing, but behind these habiliments thero was literally-nothing. When the Prince came into the world on the 12th of August, 1762, he was received with every testimonial of idolatry, and the spirit of adulation pursued him to the end of his career. The beauty of his facewas patent to alleyes,his proficiencyin everyspecies of accomplishment was everywhere extolled, even hs supremacy as a classical scholar was loudly proclaimed. lTo individual had ever been portrayed in such a variety of costumes,-in short, there was scarcely a sort of dress in which he was not exhibited. A. populous district or an army was not a more expensive article to rmaintain than this superb Prince of Wvles, who was always taking money from the nation, and always flinging it away.
As the child is father to the man, so did George IV., in Mr. Thackeray's opinion, give earnest of his future eminence by the invention of a peculiarly large and inconvenient shoe-buclde. As for his friendships and his amours, they merely bore witness to the fickleness and frivolity of his character. The only associates after his own heart were parasites and persons engagedin the mostignoble pursuits, and tbough Fox, Pitt, and Sheridan sat at his table in his earlier days, his intimacy with those great men was but the freak of a mom ent, and they must have felt in his presence they were only associating with a Derson in every respect their inferior. However, good and bAd, friends and mistresses, all were dropped in turn, and the favourite of the day was forgotten on the morrow.
The reputed kindness of George IV. to the servants of his household Mr. Thackeray willingly conceded, with the remark that this one small virtue comprised all his goodness, and that it was counterbalancel by his heartless conduct to Brummel, when that lunlucky beau-the Prince's superior-fell from his fashionable eminence.
Theold story that hlr. Elliston, when he represented Geerge IV. at the mimic coronation enacted at Drury-lne, actually took himself for the monarch wrhose rank he assumed, was told by Mr. Thackeray with the sapplementary comment, that the belief of the real personage that he ha( anything to do with the glorious deeds performed during his Regency was equally abeurd. He might indeed have neen possened of the bravery inherent in tbe House of Brunswick and displyed in such an eminent degree by his predecesiors, but the fact could never bo proved by a being who iassed his exiietence wrapped up in SVfaddlhngclothes, ain his weeping interviews with his Ministers on the subject of the Cathlolic Emancipation Bill contrasted unfavourably wfith the manly resistance of his father on a similar occasion.
Mr. Thackeray did not omit the opportunity for reflecting on the great change in manners and morals that has tken place since the decease of George IV. Many a man now old had indulged during youth in the vices of gaming, drinking, and swearing to a degree that woald now create amazement, and the decline of the " ring" was one of the changes that show the improvement or the age within the last 25 years. The former prevalence of vices now obsolete was illustrated by several amusing anecdotes.
Utterly denying the claim of George IV. to be termed the "first gentleman of Europe" 3r. Thackeray devoted the latter part of hi8 lectur, to a coment on a few personages
vho might be regarded as the real gentlemen of the period. These wsere Sir Walter Scott, Bobert Southey, Bishop HIeber, and Lord Collingood, whose moral virtues he extolled in connexion with their intellectual greatness As a final contrast he drew a comparison between the first party given by the Prince in London-described by the magazines of the day as the nc plus tsrd of magnificence-with a ceremony that took place in the same year, namely the retirement of Washington from public life in the presence of tho United States' Congress. A compliment to the present sovereig, a possessed of the virtues iu which George IV. was so lamentably deficient, concluded the discourse, and Mr. Thackeray retired amia loud acclamations.
The lecture, of wrhich we have briefy stated the purport, was the last of the series, but so great has been the attraction of the course that it was commenced de voro on Saturday, the 10th Inst., and the Saturdays intended for a-separate body of subscribers are not yet terminated. The room has beenr invariably crowded to repletion, and a passenger in Edwards-street, seeing the throngs that have emerged from the doors of the Marylebone Institution, would scarcely have believed that a lecture was the cause of an excitement so extraordinary. Themerit of being the first to mske an un-illustrated lecture a causo of " crush" is entirely.due to 3r. Thackeray.
While on the subject of the Marylebone Institution, we may state that the Mronday evenings aro devoted to the dramati¢ readings of Miiss Glyn, whose series comimnenced on the 19th inst. with Antonp and Clcopalra. Those yet to come will comprnise the Mirchcinl of I'm icc, Romco and Julict, and Oe1sWJo.

The State Of Newgate.
THE ST4TE OF NEWGlATE.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Some remarks have been made on mne for a pasage in a letter insrted in your paper, referring incidentally to the convicts in Newgato all beiug confned in one room together, and vwhich may be fresh in your readers' memory from your leading article on the state of Newgate. I anwer that such statement were true to the very letter, not exag. gerated, not declamatory, not deniable in any single particular; but to pass from personal matter (for which the public will care nothing, unless it bears onpublic interests), permit me to ask for a small space to call attention to the following corroboration of the state of Nea f6 from a report made to the Lord Mayor and Court of aldermen aS far back as the 20th of November, 1855, by the Rev. John Davis, the Ordinary of Newgate.
He there states that,-
" The great and crying evil in tho gaol of NYewgate is the want of sufficient means to s parate prioners who may not be addicted to crime as a habit from those inveterate offenders whose desire and de]ight is to lead others deeper and deeper into guilt, and particularly those who may not be so thoroughly cont ated as themselves t is obviously contrary to all propriety, but there is nothing against thelaw, to confine in the same ward these persons
"1. A burglar, whose habit of entering houses inthe night for plunder leads to many adventures and hair-breadth escapes, and renders hin a diverting and entertaining companion, where he can in security to himself describe his proceedings as he can in Newgate, and where he becomes a dangerous and most pernicious associate of others not so deeply versed in crime.
"2. A swelhnobsman, dressed up as smart as fashionable clothes can make him, generally with little or no education, but whose dexterity is chiefly in his fingers and his cool impudence.
"3. A bank clerk, accused of forgery, but steeped to his chin in lieentiousness, profligacy, and vice, and ready to receive any further iustructions in iniquity.
"4. A man who, from depraved and brutally dissolute habits, has killed his wife, but a coroner's jury has made his offence manslaughter.
5. A receiver of stolen goods, who has been the purchaser of gold watches, the produce of burglaries, plate to an amount, and has for years known all the most successf thieves of every description, and is well recognized in the ward where he is placed
" 6. An utterer of forged bank-notes, who has misled many, and plundered the public through a series of years by plausible pretexts and apparent respectability.
"7 One of a gang of foreers who for years have lived and growrn rich on the plunder of bankers, while the dupes the emloyd hve eenconvicted and transported.
' 8. youm bee n chred with embezzlemnent, rho se crime may be the mis-appropriation of a few shillings, and who is petrified and astounded with the companions around
" let us just imagine what eight such offenders, shut up for 20 out of 24 hours together, have to talk about. The wards in Newgate are so constructed that it is impossible to overhear the conversation that takes place; but from other sources I havo been many times informed what it isI and this, deplorable as it is, cannot be materially alterei unless the prison be differently constructed, or the number of officers so increased as to render it possible to keep up vigilant personal superintendence both by day and night.
'"The burglar will suggest how they might escape out of prison, and several of the same class of offenders in the samge ward are al was dangerous.
" The swe? lnobsman relates his peculiar adventures. He travels a good deal. In fashionable ball-rooms, in banking-houses, in churches, aud at races, or wherever numbers of the upper classes meet, he is in attendance. He telLs Isis comnpanions how he has succeeded; he shows them the way to accomplish his purpose; and, if they doubt him, he picks their own pocket to prove it to them. He informs them bowv to fix the attention of the party he wants to operate upon, and when that is rivetted points out the method thait succeeds.
"The receiver of stolen goods tells them that if he gets off without punishment he shall be glad to give them as much as anybody for what they get. He has a crucible always hot; that it is foolish to run risks for the sake of a little more; and he can do their bank-notes for them. In ftact, he is carrying on his offences within the walls of the prison just as effectually as if he were at liberty, and the amount of mischief that he does to incipient offenders does not always end when the seducer is convicted; it merely co mnmences should he be acquitted.
" The utterer of forged banknotes goes through his adventures, and describes the disguises he assumes, the dupes he has employed, and-what is worse-the great success be bus mnet vrtth i for it seems f abulons to repa what such men say they oave acquired But whetherrue or false, fabulous or fact, its influence for contaminating, debasing, and destroying the hearers is just the same.
" The effects produced by these and worse communications-for it would be silly to suppose that we can ever get at the worst-are lamentable and most disastrous. Humanity, justice, and judgment alike cry aloud for the extermination of such evils."
After refering to what has been done in other places to remedy these evils, the report proceeds
"NRewgate will stand alone in the metropolis as a gaol of association, sutbjected to the corruptions and contaminations of past ages, and unreformed among all the new and valuable improvements carried out in the other metropolitan prisons."
Thus, while my statement referred to the assoeciation of the convicts (and, alas, sometimes the innocent) after trial and conviction, the chaplain, in the above report (as he and others, by the by, had often done before), shows how the prisoners are confined together before trial.
As Newgate is the prison of the Central Criminal Courta Court having by far the most important and extensive criminal jurisdiction in this country, including, not only London, but the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Rent, and Surrey, sitting every month to try at each sitting always more than 100 prisoners-it is of paramount importanco that such prison of Newgate should be one of the best regulated prisons in the country; whereas now it is one of the worst, if not, indeed, the very worst; and, while the extracts I have given relate to what goes on there in the day, r emphatically warn those who have its control and supervision that the doings of the day Egive no idea of the far more villanous depravity which is perpoetrated there in the wards at night,

The Late Duke Of Rutland, K.G.
THE LATE DUKE OF BUTLAZD, K.G.
We have received intelligence of the death of the venerable Duke of Rutland, which took place at half-past 3 o'clock yesterday, at Belvoir-castle, near Grantham, in his 79th year. The immediate cause ,of his death was an attack of bronchitis, superve-uing on a gradual decay.
Johu Henry MhInners, 5th Duke and 14th Earl of Rutland, Senior Knight of the Garter, Lord Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum of the county of Leicester, and Colonel of the Leicestershie Militia, High Steward of Cambridge, Recorder of ;Scarborough and Grantham, a trustee of the i3ritish Museum, and one of the Council of King's College, London, was born on the 4th iof January, 1778. He was the eldest and last surviving 3on of Charles, fourth Duke (son of the -celebrated Marquis of Granby), who died suddenly in 1787, at the age of 34, from an internal attack while holding the important post of Lord-Lieutenant of Jreland,*by the Lady Mary Isabella Somerset, youngest daughter of Charles, fourth Duke of Beaufort, who died in 1831, long after she had outlived 'ter reputation as the most beautiful woman of her day.
The late Duke succeeded to the princely title and -estates of his father when he was under ten years of age, and consequently held his dukedom for *the unprecedented period of all but 70 year3. At te usual age his Grace entered Trinity College ;Canibridge, then under Dr. Postlethwaite, where he took the degree of M.A. in 1797. At the time of his decease he must have been nearly the senior 'member of that college, with the exception of Lord 'Lyndhuist, who graduated there some three years before him. Having come to his title at so 'early an age, his Grace was never able to hold a -seat in the House of Commons. In 1799, however, -he took his seat in the Upper House, and naturally gave his support to the then existing Ministry of Mr. Pitt, -who, it may here be remarked, owed to the aecommendation of the father his first introduction ,to public life as member for Lord Lonsdale's pocket'borough of Appleby. The Duke, however, though on one occasion, we believe, he moved or seconded the Address in theHouseof Lords, nevertook anactive or promiinent part in the proceedings of that assemibly, but contented himself with -giving to the MIinistries of Pitt, Addington, Perceval, and Liver7pool, as afterwards to Wellington, Peel, and Lord Derby a steady, but silent support. During the oreater portion of his time his brdAhers, the late Xords Charles and Robert Mainers, represented the 'Tory interest in the counties of Leicester and Camibridge, in which lies the greater part of the property 'of the house of Rutland.
The late Duke was by conviction a strong supporter of the old-fashioned opinions of his party on 'Uhurch and State questions, and accordingly he opposed the relaxation of the Test and Corporation Acts, and also resisted the Catholic Relief Bill as long as he felt that the latter could be refused with safety to the State. Indeed, so late as the month of January, 1829, we find the name of his Grace headin an address to the Crown against the pro.posed innovation in the constitution, but as soon as lie was convinced that the Duke of WVellington and Sir Robert Peel had but one course open before them, if they wished to avoid the horrors of a civil war, he did not shrink from professing a change in his opinions and from vivincr his vote in favour of the measure. «1ventually, however, his deeply-rooted pri'ciples or prejudices resumed their place, and at the final division in the House of Lords upon that important measure his Grace was one of the four dukes who voted among the minority,declarina themselves II not content." To the Reform Bill, also, his Grace was strenuously opposed upon prin'ciple, thoughl here again, in the self-same spirit, he 'abstained from recording his vote against the ,measure on the decisive and final division of April 14, 1832. His opposition to the repeal of the corn laws is too recent to need being repeated here. A 'Tory by conviction, and possessed, as he was, of the extensive political influence which vwas inseparable from his large landed property, it is not remark'able that his Grace should have received an early imark of Ministerial favour in the shape of the Blue Riband of the Garter, which was eonferred 'upon him in 1803 by the then Premier, Mr. Ad*dington, afterwards first Lord Sidmouth, and for many years previous to the time of his decease he bad become senior Knight of that illustrious order.
His Grace, however, found a more congenial sphere of action in his native county and his -domestic circle than in political affairs and the atmosphere of courts. As a magistrate, country gentlenan, friend, neighbour, and parent it is not too much to say that he was equally honoured and beloved. As a proof of the affectionate reaard in which he was held by his tenantry we may mention that so lately as Christnmas, 1855, the tenants 'on the Belvoir estates presented him with his :portrait, which they had painted by subscription by Grant. He took great pride in his corps of Leicestershire Yeomanry ; and at Christmas and other seasons of the year, and especially on his own birthday (Jan. 4), he rejoiced in keeping opea house in "princely style, and in entertaining not eonly his family and friends, but the leading, inhabitants of the county and hlis own poorer dependents. He also subscribed largely to the maintenance of the Leicestershire hunt, though for some years he had been unable to follow the amusements of the chase. -It should be added that his Grace was regarded with high esteem by the poet Crabbe, vho owed to his father his earliest preferments; and who mentions him with much respect in the prefaces prefixed to his poetical works.
By his wife, the lady Elizabeth Howard, daughter 'of the fifth Earl of Carlisle, to whom he was married in 1799, and wlho died about 30 years ago, he had issue four daughters and three sons. Of the former, -two are deceased, the lady Katharine Jermyn, and the Lady Emmeline Stuart Wortley; though the reputation of the latter lady as a poetess of no -common order will not readily pass away. Her death, near Beyrout, in the autumn of last year, which will be fresh in the memory of our readers, was a grievous blow to the nDuke, who was fondly attached to her. His two surviving daughters are the Lady Elizabeth F. )rummiond and the Lady Adeliza Norman. His 'Grace's three sons all hold seats in the present House of Commons-the Marquis of Granby, for North Leicestershire; Lord John Manners, for Colchester; and Lord George Manners, for Cambridgeshire. Lord George, who is also a captain in the Horse Guards, was rccently married to the Lady Adeliza How,ard, daughter of the late and sister of the present Duke of Norfolk. The name 'of Lord Joha Manners has long been before the political world as head of the Woods and Forests -under the short-lived Administration of Lord Derby, while the literary public are better asquaiilted with his Lordship as the author of some poems of a highly feudal and medi eval character, and of a Plea for Natiowal Holydays. His Grace's eldest son, Charles Ceeil John, Marquis of Oranby, who has now suceeeded to the Dukedom, 'was appoioted in 1852 Lord-Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum of Lincolnshire, on the resignation of the late Earl Brownlow. He was born in 1815, and is unmarried. His Lordship is well known as one of the heads of the " country" or Protectionist party, in which capacity he has frequently spoken wvith considerable ability in the House of Commons,, though he did not take office under Lord Derby. It may be remembered that he declined to lead the great Conservativc party in the House of Comnous on the death of Lord (;eorge Bentinck.
'Tihe vast estates. of Belvoir are possessions inherited by the ducal family of Rutland on account -of their deecent from the ancient Barons Roos or De Roos, an heiress of which noble family married Sir Robert Manners, ex-Sheriff of Northumberland, towards the close of the 15th century, and eventually succeeded to the Barony of De Ros. Thomas, 13th Lord de Ros, created Earl of Rutland in 1623, and honoured with the Knighthood of the Garter, held many important posts in the Court and Cabinet of Henry VIII. He -was tjv. grandson of Anne Plantagenet, sister of King nVdward IV. It is remarked as strange by Sir Egerton Brydges, in his article on the English peer-age, in the Quarterly Reiev) for April, 1830, that, "notwithstanding this alliance with the House of York, the Earls of Rutland were able to escape the 'oppression of the Tudorvs." The second Earl rebuilt 'the family mansion of Belvoir. On the death of the third Earl, in 1587, the titles of Rutland and De Roo became separated, the latter passing in the female
* The late Dr. Watson, Bishop of Llandaff, in his place in the House of Lords, pronounced a warin eulogiuiin on the Duke soon after his deceawe, which may be found reCorded in the enndeman'is Magazine for November, 1787. A more correct and far more graphic account of his character, and of his Lord-Lieutenancv in Ireland, miay be folund in the 2d vol. of Sir Nathaniel Wraxall's Poathuus aMiwirs (If ffiiOwi lime.
line to his Lordship's only daughter, wife of the cele. brated Lord Burleigh, afterwards Earl of Exeter; but the titles were again united for a time in the person of the sixth EarL The tenth Earl, who had previously received a summons to Parliament from Charles IL, in his father's lifetime, s. Lord Manners, was raised to the dukedom in 1703. The second Duke married a daughter of the celebrated patriot, William, Lord Russell, by whom he became the grandfather of the great Marquis of Granby, whose military reputation, handed down to our own times on the signboard of many a village inn, WaS %ron during the years which he spent in Germany as Commander in Chief of the British forces serving under Prince Ferdinand of Brunavc1. The Marquis of Granby, who died before his father, and consequently never succeeded to the dukedom, was grandfather of the Duke so lately deceased.
The late Archbishop (M1anners-Sutton) of Canterbury and the first Lord Manners, sometime Lord Chancellor of Ireland, were first cousins of the deceased Duke. T'he Archbishop's eldest son, Sir Charles Manners Sutton, was for many years member for the University of Cambridge, and Speaker of the House of Commons from 1817 to 1834, and was elevated to the Viscountey of Canterbury in 1835.
Murder Of A Wife By Poisoning.
MUBDE2R OF A WIFk BYTPOISONING.
On Monday night an inquest, held at Chesham, before MIr. F. Charsley, one of the coroners for the county of Bucks, resulting in a verdict of " Wilful murder" gainst Philip *Vhite, a shoemaker of that town, for poisoning his wife, was brought to a conclusion. The inquest, which was opened on the 30th ult., was twice adjourned. On the two former occasions a number of witnesses were examined, including two little girls, the prisoner's daughters by a former wfe, of the ages of 13 and 8. The substance of the evidence on those occasions was as follows :-The prisoner, whose first wife died some time ago of consumption, leaving four children, one son now married, a boy of 14, and the two girls above alluded to, had been married to the deceased only nine months, she being at the time of her marriage the mother of three illegitimate children, one of whom her husband had to maintain. It appears that during this period and for mouths previously Ann Seaward had been living in the prisoner's house, apparently assisting in tho domestic work. Between this woman and White an ilicit intercourse had been carried on previous to his second marriage and subsequently during the temporary absence of his wife. Her evidence, most reluctantly given, further went to show that he had administered to her a drug called hiera-picra to procure abor. tion, she being in the familyway dorinm his wife's absence. It appeared that the deceased had 'een for five weeks nursing a woman at Chesham-common, when she was recalled by her husband, Ann Seaward having declined to remain longer in the house if his wife was away, in consequence of the illuatured remarks of the neighbours. She accordingly returned home on the 14th of December, and she died on the Sunday following Christmas-day, having been confined to her bed for a week with erysipelas. During this period the prisoner called in no medical aid stating he owed the doctor money for his previous wife. She was attended by her mother and sister and also by Ann Seaward, and when Mr. Dewsnap, a surgeon, was called in by the mother the day before the deceased died he found her fast sinking and in a most neglected state, though the mother and sister appear to have done all they could for her. A witness named Mitchell swore that the -risoner on the 23d said to the deceased she ought to have a
octor, and that she replied, " Pooh ! What good could he do ?" and another woman, who had taken work to the prisoner while his wife was dying, proved he had said he wished he was a single man, as he had been the Christmas before. In consequence of the neglected state of the deceaed an inquest was held, when the testimony of Surgeons Farthorne and Dewsnap, of Chesham, having shown the existence of arsenic, the case assumed a more serious complexion, and the prisoner was taken into custody immediately after the first day's proceedings on the charge of poisoning his wife.
On the inquiry being reopened yesterday, Mr. Joseph Heath, a chyniist in the town, deposed that on the 4th of Deceusber the deceaeed, who was a customer of his, had purchased half an ounce of arsenic, alleging it wiS to poison *i,ce. She had signed the entry reguired by the act, and he gave her two packages of arsesiuc coloured with soot, in the proportion of one-sixteenth, cautioning her to be careful as to its use. It was quite usual to sapply arsenic for killinz rats and mice to persons who were nowvn.
Profeor Taylor was next examined.-He deposed that he had received for analysis a jar, containing the stomach of the deceased and its contents, the intestines, a Portion of the liver, one kidney, the spleen, and part of the heart. From a ch5mnical analysis he had come to the following conclusions :-First, that the contents of the stomach of the deceased contained arsenic, chiefly in the blood and mucus; second, that there was arsenic in the coats of the stomach ; third, that the appearances presented by the stomach were such as usually attended poisoning by arsenic; fourth, that tkingthese appearancesin conjunction with the discovery of arsenic in the mucus and blood of the contents of the stomach, and the absence of any other cause of death revealed, by the post mnorten examination, it was higbly probable that the death of the deceased was caused by arsenic. A supplementary examination confirmed these conclusions. He had no doubt that a sufficient quantity of arsenic to destroy life had been taken by the deceased. The body of the deceased was not penetrated with arsenic to the extent he had known in other cases, but that might have arisen from the poison being taken only a short penod before death, so that it had no time for diffusion, or it might have been taken some period before death, and removed by what was technicaUy called elimination, or the throwing of the poison out of the body. Few persons lived mnore than three days after taking arsenic, and the appearances presented in this case were such as were commonly seen when the poison has proved fatal in two or three days. There was no arsenic dissolved in the stomach. The appearances were consistent either with a recent administration of arsenic in a large dose, or an old administration in several sniall doses.
Philip White, a son of the prisoner, aged 14, who cried a good deal while he was giving his evidence, deposed that ne evening, a month before his stepmother's death, he asked her if she ad the face ache, and she replied she had the heartache. About five weeks ago his father, who was drank at the tine, said to him, " Your mother is a -; she is no mother t you." His mother was downstairs, and might have heard the reniark. He never heard his father wish his motherdead, or knewthem to quarrel. She was in bed about a week before she died. She was light headed before Christmas day. On that day she had her dinner of beef pudding and savoys, taken to her by his sister. She eat all the savoys and wanted more. She died on Sunday, the 28th. He never heard of her having been sick tiU after she was dead. His sister EatniU had said she herself had been sick while Iss mother was ill. The night before his mother died Ani Seaward was in the houe, and she and his father went butside for a few minutes. He had once lieard his father say to his mother d be wished he had been S hxundred miles off before he had seen her.", He never beard his mother coniplain of his father's attentions to Ann Seaward.
Superintending.covsa~ble Wootton deposed that on his taking the prisoner into custody after the first day's adlournment he saidhbe would go and tel the jury all about it. Witness said " You are too late; the jury have lef!," The prisoner, turning to the witness, Mr. Mitchell, said "aI wish I had told the jury all about it; ifit had not ben for you I would, but, a-s we are all married, I'll tellyu
wato itwas. twAbout three weeks ago my wife went to Mr. Heath's and bought some arsenic. She used the arsenic occasionary to get rid of a child. The last time she took it was on Monday last." Witness took him to the lock-up, when the prisoner, in the prsence of Buinker, the lock-up keeper, said, "1Ab well; she's dead and gone. I suppose I shall awing next March for her." On beinfg tAken to Aylsbuy Gol he risnersai, " aminncen ofthe

Ann Seaward was then recalled. She is rather goodlooking, hut very deaf, and mnany years the prisoner's juio, e being about.50. She abed tears while under ex-
amnto, and the prisoner watched her intently. She said that before the prisoner bad mar-ried his last wife he had asked her to miarry him, and she had refused because he was so much older than herslf. During his wife's Mlness he asked her would she marry him if his wife died, and she replied she would. She said so because he had said that on the Wednesday, the 24th, he coiild have killed her sooner than let any one have her. She had been out that evening with another young mnan, and the prisoner had followed her.JHe struck her for iton the Thuisaday, and said, " You say you won't go with any one else any more," which she repeated. The prisoner had given her money to buy hiecrapicira. He mixed a dose for her, and it made her very sick. Heafterwards gave her another dose. One night while his wife was away she was in the prisoner's house, when he took her fromn her own bed to his.
Thin the prisoner denied, and asked the witness if she had not kept company with a young man from Michaelmas to Christmas, to which she replied in the affirmative.

DUBLIN, TUESDAY MORNING. TE QUEEN'S COLLEOES.
It is stated that Government is about to i3sue a commission, at the head of which Mr. Temple is likely to be placed, for the purpose of inquiry into the internal economy, curZica of education, and attendance of the several professor and presidents of the Queen's Colleges, and the several rules and ragulations which govern each, with a view to their modifloation and improvement.
IaX YIII AT TM ]RA Ai Q1 IrE-lAlUPt
The origin ot the acc;dent, which threatened the destruction of this noble edifice, still remains a mystery, but it seems that it is in some measure to be attributed to a scheme of economy which has been recently carried into effect by the directory, who have thought fit to abolish the night watch of two clerks which, up to a late period, patrolled all the corridors at stated periods during the night. The fire might have broken out despite the utmost vigilance, but it could not have spread had the watch continued. The following additional particulars are supplied by the morning papers-
" The event, although happily productive, as far as can yet be seen, of nothing worse than considerable temporary inconvenience, was of the most alarming nature, and had the flames continued but for a brief space longer with their original fury the chief ornament in a city proverbial for the elegance and architectural iplendour of its public buildings must unquestionably have, been laid in ashes. The fire originated in the very heart of the edifice, the accountantgeneral's departm ent, which is divided at one extremity by a corridor from the board-room, or ancient House of Lords, at the other end from the private apartments of the housekeeper by a corresponding passage, and runs parallel to and adjoins on one side the cash-office, which in former days was known as the Irish Houseof Commons, and onthe other the entrance to the quarter in which the bullion is deposited. After the conclusion of business on Saturday Mr. Roberts, the gentlem an discharging the duties of house keeper, went his accustomed rounds, and saw that the different gaslights had been duly extinguished, and that nothing was to be apprehended from the remnants of the fires. On Saturday night the same precaution was repeated, and on Sunday, to all appearance, everything was secure. The mischief is therefore believed to have originated in one of the lengthened flues extending from the fireplaces in the bookkeepers' or accountant-general's offices-the depart. ment being divided into these two separate chambersto a stack of chimneys in the main building, between which and the scene of the conflaration there is the corridor already referred to. Some difficulty is experienced in accounting for the manner in which the fire, supposing it to have originated in this manner, communicated with the furniture in the apartments, which was almost wholly consumed; and, on the other hand, adopting the idea entertained by a few, if the fire had its commencement in the desks, how it should have ignited the roof. Various accounts are given of the manner and the persons by whom the flames were first seen. One version is that Miss Roberts, who had been compelled to remain awake by indisposition, saw the light from her window, which immediately overlooks the roof of the accountant-general's department. The sentry upon duty avers that he was the first to discover it; and the alarm was certainly communicated in the first instance to College-street police-station by PoHee-constable Joseph Lambert, 98 B, who from his post in Fleet-street observed the conflagration, which would appear to have manifested itself in an exceedingly sudden manner. After some delay, during which the flames were burning fiercely, the keys of one of the front gates in the railings at College-green were obtained, inside of which there was a large tank of water that afforded a capital supply to four engines, which were at once connected wit it, Eight watering carts, filled, also arrived about half-past 5 oclock, but could not get into the yard ia rear of the bank premises, owing to the quantity of nose which was lying about in all directions. The military guard having chrge of the building, under Lieutenants oJohnston and Tracy, worked with good will and considerable effect; and the staff-officer of the night, upon being applied to, wasaboutto orderdown a strongforce of soldiers torender assistance, when, as is stated, hewaspreventedfrom2doing so by the intervention of the officer in charge of the police, At a subsequent period, however, their attendance was considered necessary, and a numerous party of the 4th Regiment under command of Captain Peyton and Lieutenant Martin arrived from Shlip-street Barracks, and a still larger number of the Grenadier Guards, under Colonel Lambert, reached College-green about 8 o'clock, by which time, however, the fire had been almost entirely subdued, Its force having be gun considerably to lessen a little before 6 o'clock. A window at one end of the roof was forced out and the heat cracked a great portion of the glass in the main building, which narrowly escaped destruction. At the other end tbe corresponding window in the House of Lords, which is situated at a similar distance, fel out, and here also the framework became molten, while the wall of the corridor beneath became ominously blistered. The flames, also, darting out through the centre skylight, communicated with the roof of the cash-office, although the latter is very many feet higher; but the ornamental coping, which is of wood, was at first charred, andsubsequently caught fire, while the stone supports were cbipped and blackened. The flame ran up the roof, and in lO minutesmore this noblehall would have been destroyed but for the engine on the roof, which fortunately stopped its PZogress before much damage had been done. The most singularfeaturewithregardtothe fire is, that where it was fiercest it didnot extend generally, but burnt one portion of the roof completely; and again in another porti n lower down did the same, leaving the intervening space almost wholly untouched. When at length water could be brought to bear on the interior of the accountant-ecneral's office, it was seen that the door of one of the two iron safes, which are set in recesses at either side of the fireplace, and in which all the important books and documents are kept, had become quite red, and it was therefore a matter of urgent moment to cool it, The other, from its peculiar position, could not at that time be got at, but both, with their priceless contents, fortunately escaped unharmed, saving merely the trifling damage done by the dropping of some wooden moulding from off the inside of one safe-door, which, it is stated, slightly singed the edges of two of the books. There was also a book-rack in this apartment, which was completely charred, but its contents, for the most part some ledgers of less moment, escaped with the loss of their bindings, although from the evidences upon the floor it was manifest that some had not merely ' with back and sides gone bare," but that more than a few had been wholly consumed. Contradictory statements are made upon this head, but of this there can he no doubt, that a very lively bonfire of a pile of books, which was going forward in one portion of the apartment, was extinguished by the water from the roof. The valuable furniture was very nearly, if not altogether, destroyed, and the contents of the desks, with letters, small sums of money, office coats, &c., wholly perished; and after the temperature hadlsufficiently subsided specimens of what had been the Queen's current coin were picked up most woefully defaced, in defiance of ' the statute in that case made and provided.' Strange to add, however, a diamond ring, which had beenin one of the desks, escaped without injury. At the time the fire broke out there were four families sleeping upon the preniises, in addition to the porters upon duty-i.e, the secretary, deputysecretary, and cashier's households, all of whom dwelt in premises detached from the main building; and the housekeeper, whose apartments were, one might say, 'next door' to the fire. In the words of the officiaT return there were sleeping in the house 26 individuals-' six men and 17 women-all escaped without accident,' The insurances effected by the bank are considerable in amount-i. e, in the National Office,10,0001 .- Patriotic 10,000L; Royal Exchange, 5,0001.; and Adals, s,ooo
But, notwithstanding those heavy insurances, and the fact that the numberless corridors tend in a measure to isolate any portion of the premises that may be attacked by fire, there was a very generally expressed opinion yesterday that the dtrectors had not exercised a sound discretion in discontinuing 'the Bank Guard,' which formerly took nightly charge of the buildin and that, if this corps had been still in existence, in aX probabity the fire would have been sooner discovered, and it would not have reached the dangerous beight to which it extended. In the opinion of competent persons the fire had probably been smouldering for days, and only burst forth when it succeeded in getting vent-an opinion which is corroborated to a certain extent by the fierce body of flame which burst forth when the roof was stripped.
"The following 'official' report of the accident has been supplied by the Bank authorities-
"`' Bank of Ireland, Dublin, Monday, January 19.-Early this morning a fire broke out at the Bank of Ireland, in the accountant-general's offce, the interior of which was destroyed, but the books and papers connected with tbe department, having been deposited as usual over night in the 'safe,' are uninjured. The fire made no further Progress, and the business of the hank proceeds as usual. The premises are largely insured ''

THE SADLIRS.-IU justice to Mr. Nicholas Sadleir it should hb stated that that gentleman is no relative of the brothers John and James Sadleir, being a member of a different family and of a different religious creed. As such he is naturally anxious to relieve himself of the odium of being in any degree connected with the suicide or the ex-Meniber for Tipperary. John Sadleir served his apprenticeship to Mr. N. Sadleir, and subsequently became a junior partner in the firmJ but on the ditsolution of tho rartneBh p all commuiiicatfon ceased between them. It Fhould*also be mentioned that the paragraph in the Dublin Journal, referred to in The Tsimes, was supplied without the suthority of MIr. N.

The Public Health.
THE PU7BLI0 REALTH.
(From the Registrar-General's Weekly Return.)
In the week that ended on Saturday the deaths registered in orndon were 1,17L Of these 582 were deaths of males, 589 those of females. In the ten years 1847-56 the average number of deaths in the weeks corresponding with last week was 1,219; but, for the purpose of comparison, this should be raised proportionally to increase of population up to the present time, in which case it wil become 1,341. The result of the comparison is that the deaths of last week were lees by 170 than the averge rate of mortality would have produced.
The deathasin the week from diseases of the respiratory organs (under which head phthisis is not included) were 280; in corresponding weeks of previous years they ranged from 153 inx the year 1853, when the mean temperature of the week was 45 deg., to 386 in the cold winter of 1855, when the mean temperature of the week was so low as 29 deg. Since the present year commenced the weather has been mild, and the mortality from diseases of this class is not high. In the last two weeks the deaths from bronchitis rose from 140 to 170, and those from pneumonia fell from 87 to 77. Phthisis (or consumption) was fatal to 152 persons last week, of whom 73 died in the period of life 20-40 years, And 52 in the subsequent period, 40-60 years, leaving only 27 of the deaths from this disease at earlier and later ages. Whooping-cou,gh has increased within the last four weeks, and in the present returnw 55 children are stated-to have died of it Thirty-four deaths occurred from typhus and common fever; this number is not high comparatively, but it should be observed that nearly hal occurred in the Eastern division, while only four or five deaths were registered in each of the other divisions. A family in Shoemaker-row, City of London, has lost three children in 10 days from scarlatina, but the registrar has not heard that the complaint is prevailing in his district. In a house in Haberdashersi-plxce (East), Shoreditch, four deaths have occurred within 10 weeks, arising from disease of various idnds.
The deaths of four nonagenarians were recorded in the week. The oldest was a gentleman of the age of 96 years, who died in Lambeth.
Last week the births of 966 boys and 818 girls, in all 1,784 children, 'were registered in London. In the 10 corresponding weeks of the years 1847-56 the average number was 1,521.
At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height of the barometer in the week was 29-636 inches. On Sunday (the 11th) the reading fell to 28-85 inches, and on Saturday rose to 30'21 inches. These values were the lowest and highest in the week. The mean temperature of the week was 36-5 deg., which is rather above the average of the same week in 43 years (as determined by Mr. Glaisher). The thermometer fell to 26 deg. on Thursday, the lowest point in the week. The range in the week was 20-5 deg. The mean dew-point temperature was 33-9 deg., and the difference between this and the mean air temperature was 2-6 deg. The mean temperature of the water of the Tlames was 40-1 deg. The direction of the wind was very variable, on Saturday it was south-west. The fall of rain was 0-39 inch, most of it on Sunday.

Surrey Theatre.
SURREY THEATBE.
As a substantial prelude to the mirth and splendour of the Christmas pantomime a new drama, with quite as much pretension to be caUed a comedy ags many pieces of the oldfashioned "legitimate" repertory, has been produced at this theatre. The plot is of the simplest. Mr. Praiseworthy(Mr. Shepherd), an elderlygentleman, dwelling on a fine estate in Yorkshire, has brought up two nephews, Reginald (Mr. Basil Potter) and Theodore Prodigal (Mr. Calvert). The latter of these two youths has offended his uncle by losing a large sum of money in a suspicious manner and clinching the misfortune with a m&-altiance. He is accordingly cast off, and is living with his young wife in the humble capacity of a field-labourer. Reginald, on the other hand, is making a briliant figure in the metropolis, where he has married a lady of supposed bigh extraction. The worthy uncle, who is now residing alone, makes a will, in which he leaves all his property to the more showy brother, and probably this document would in due time have been carried into effect, had not an old friend, Major Stormont (Mr. VoUaire), conversed with Mr. Praiseworthy on the characters of the two nephews, and hinted his conviction that Reginald is a heartless scoundrel and Theodore a very ill-used person. To test the truth in this important matter Mr. Praiseworthy vives out that he is dead, and his kinsmen come to the family mansion to hear the reading of the will. Reginald and his consort give themselves all the airs proper to upstart insolence, while Theodore and his peasantwife are exceedingly amiable aLd interesting. The conduct of all parties is closely watched by an old steward, who is a very mysterious personage in the eyes of the dramatis person7w, but whom the audience recognise as Mr. Praiseworthy himself. The will is read by iJ ajor Stormont; Reginald is allowed to enjoy a temporary belief that he is sole devisee, when his hopes are crushed by the appeatance of the testator, who tears up the unrighteous testament, ejects Reginald and wife from the premises, and takes to his arms the wrronged brother, who has really committed no fault at all, and who would not even have incurred suspicion had not his letters to his uncle been intercepted by the designing Reginald. No party is more diqguated at this turn in affairs than one Mr. Capias (Mr. H. Widdicombe), a sharp lawyer, who has already bought the old gentleman's estate of Reginald, on the faLse supposition that he is sole devises.
The notion of feigning death to watch the living is not by any means new to the stage, and the connoisseur of the class of comedy that prevailed at the dawn of the present century wil be perfectly aware that the school of ethics by which fashion and vice are declared to be synonymons is of no recent foundation. Mr. Phillips, the author of the new piece, which, by the way, is entitled A Bird in t1te Hand worth two in the Beh, has drawn his inspiration from a familiar source, and has painted his characters in all the strong black and white proper to the school, contrasting the most outrageous insolence with the n7mha lStra of virtuous sentimentality. But, at the same time, he exhibits constructive talent of no mean order, and, though his play is manifestly English, he has submitted to the severest rules of the old French classics, making the whole action take place in one room, within the limits of a single day. :5imple as it is, the story entirely fills up three long acts, and without the introduction of a single melodramatic incident the interest of the audience is maintained to the end. The dialogue, moreover, though not free from old-fashioned common-places, is frequently smart and pointed, abounding in lines which, though they may not sparkle brilliantly to the eye of a reader, tel with great fh-rce on the ears of a general audience.
Mr. Praiseworthy, who is the chief personage of the piece, being mostlyseen in the assumed character of steward, is played with a great deal of quiet purpose by Mr. Shepherd, who delivers with infinite unction the many sarcastic moralities put into the mouth of the eccentric, cynical old gentleman. Insolent vice and humble virtue are brought into effective contrast by Mr. Basil Potter and Miss Er&s Clayton on the one side, and Mr. Calvert and Miss Adelaide Biddles on the other. The crafty lawyer of Mr. H. Widdicombe is an admirable bit of strong colouring, and, strange to say, though this same lawyer is endowed with all the rascalty which dramatists, with scarcely an exception, award to his profession, he is a popular personage with the audience. Fashionable insolence iS the vice mainly held up to execration, and Mr. Capias, who is a rapacious creditor, is the scourge of the fashionabl insolent. A good common hatred iS the best promoter of friendship.
The action, as w e have stated, takes places in one apartment, and great pains have been hestowed to produce an elaborate representation of an old English interior, with its broad hearth and abundant ornamental devices.
Naturalized Aliens.
NATURALIZED ALIENS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Allow me to express my full concmrence with the excellent remarks that have appeared in your columns 'with regard to the rights of naturalized aliens. There can be no doubt that the circular the Home-office has sent round on this subject is in flagrant contradiction with the " Act to amend the Laws relating to Aliens." (August 6, 1844.) A single glance at the certificate which is given to every naturalized Englishman will show at once that we are entitled to the same privileges as every natural-born British subject, except that we cannot become a member of Her Majsetys Privy Council or of either House of Parliament.
gally speaking, we are therefore when abroad not outelaw,bsuthcatve the same claim to protection as all our
Unfortunately, it appears that the Home-office has subverted these simple constitutional principles in order to please the Pru8sian Government. At least I have' been infonned-and a Prussian gazette has since then coDfirmed the fact-that the circular above alluded to was drawn up in consequence of the arrest on the continent of Mr. Ziepel, formerly judge-assistant in Prussia, but for years a naturalized Bnrtish subject. Mr. Ziepel recently went to Saxony to visit his aged mother and to meet a bride whom he intended bringing over to this country. At Dresden, however, he 'was arrested by the police of Saxony, though he had never in that kingdom made himself obnoxious to any one in power. He was subsequently delivered over to Prussia, and there, at Maagdeburg, he is now in prison, accused of having committed in 1849 several political crinmes," which, acoording to the Draconic code of the Prussian Court, may be punished by death I
law and humanity alike require that the English Governm fent sluld interfere on behalf of Mr. Ziepel, as they have on behalf of Mr. Turr. I believe, too, that the former has claimed British protection. It is, hoiwever, with a view to evade the obligation of affording protection that the Homeofhco has sent forth the recent thoroughly anti-constitutional circular, thereby outetepping every limiit of the law.
By sna1-ing knowrn, Sir, these facts in the columns of your powverful paper you 'ill drawr pnblic attention to the unfortunate position of one of our fellowr-citizens, and at the same time oblize sYour ohecli,nt as,-.rt:

EMANUEL HOSPITA-L.
itr. Alderman WRE brou ht up a report from the committee for conducting the adiairs of Emanuel Hospital, recommending that 8 additional girls should be presented to that charity. The report also referred to the expediency of the removal of the hospital from Westminster to a more, distant site from the metropolis, and aisked for pDwert to enable the commnittee to seect a suitable plot of ground on which to erect a moew hospital.
The report was received, anditwa referred back to the committee to carry its objects into effect.
THlE GAOL.OF NEWGATE.
Mr. Alderman WIRE said lie wished to draw the attention of the Court to some statements of an erroneous character which had lately appeared in the pubi journals, and
which he conceivcd it to be necesmary to correct. Ho
thought that these statements ought tobe referred to the Gaol Commmittee, in order that that body might exarine into and report upon themn at the a extCourt.
Sir P. Lts UvRiE said he did not see any necesity for
referring, anodous comsunmictte on tht Srhad appeared in the ublc pper toany ommtte; ad h conceived that

"That it be referred to the Gaol Committoe to inqure Into the state of thebgaol of Newcate. and to inquire whether there Is any reasonable
on.r cmplaint. and, if so, whether It is In the power of this Canvt:to Semredy It."
Mr. Alderman CniRTT.-Eighteen months ago this Court did ap,point a committee to inquire into the state of the gaol of Nhwgate. That committee made a report upon whie the Court acted, and it was referred to the comi nisaee to devise a plan for its improvement. A plan was devised accordingly, and was submitted to the Secretary of State, as mentioned in Mr. Alderman Roses letter. The Secretary of State returned the plan, asking for further details. Further plans were then furnished to the Secretary of State, and we are expecting from dcy to day to receive the Eanction of the Government for carrying out the report of the committee whichi was appointed 18 months ago, and I bave no doubt that when Newgate shat have been altered in the way laid down in these p lan it wiu be in as satisfactory a condition as it is possible for us to make it. (Hoar,, bear.) I think, therefore, that to appoint a committee again, or to refer the matter to a committee again, is altogether unnecessary. (Hear, hear.)
Mfr. Alderman RosE.-I think that the fasts having been stated the allegation is answered, and that any further reference would only be taking up the time of the comnmittee and doing no good. The fact having been stated that aNDewgate was in an unsatisfactory condition, a counter statement has been miade showing what we have done to remedy the existing state of thing, and that is aLs much as eithertweor the public require upon the subjeia (Hear, hear.)

The Price Of Gold.
THE PrICE OF GOLD.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir, -I have been confonnded with my Australian brotber, and have suffered a gentlo reproof in your columns for his sins. Pray, therefore, allow me to remind the writer of the letter signed W. H. B.," in The Times of yesterday, and other correspondents, that I have not asked for an arithmetical demonstration of the par of exchange between Londonand Paris, and that no one has yet answered what I have saked, and what is the only difficulty. What is nmeant by saying that gold in Paris is at 6 per nille premium5?
It is no answer to this to calculate, as your correspondents do, the intrinsic par, amd then assnme and add a premium. I wish to know the nature of this premium.
A premium generally means the difference between an actual and an arbitrary price. A price or a valae can only be expressed by a compaxison of two different articles
An onnce of gold bullion must be always worth an ounce of gold bullion, for the simple reason that a can never ba equal to a + y. The pnce of gold in Paris, therefore, must neccssarily be expressed in some article different from itself-c. g., in silver bullion, silver coin, or gold coin. Your cornespondent " Par" will find that the common authorities give no information upon this point.
"E. J. P. D.," it is true, informs me that the proposition quoted ' means that the demand for gold is such that peaple are willing to give 1,006 francs in silver or copper for 1,0c0 francs in gold. " But this, if it were so, would not expre the price of gold, but the relative values of gold ana 8lver coin. This explanation, however, would indicate that silver in France is, and has been for sonie time, at an exceptional low value in relation to gold, which is obviously contradicted by the actual price of silver in the market-a price which has long made it profitable to treat French silver money as bullion, and to export five-franc pieces to foreign mark-ets.
It is possible that my question, thouh puzzling tome, is capabWe of a very simple and easy expranation. In humble anticipation, therefore, of a rap on the knuckle, rwhich shall be better deserved than the one which I have already receiveo, I again subscribe myself a

PARIS, MozDrAY, JAN. 19, 6 P.M.
I have to correct an error in my letter of yesterday with reference to Verger, who now lies under sentence of death. He has notU4days after the rejection of his appeal by the Court of Carsation, ift as is all but certain, it be rejected. He had three clear days after the sentence to appeaL Generally speaking, persons in his condition wait for the last day; Verger sent in his this morning. The Court of Cassation will, I am told, meet to-morrow, and the apDeal wiM doubtless be taken into consideration. if the Court come to a decision during the
'itting, and the decision be in the negative, he may be ordered for execution on Thursday. He has in timated a wish to petition the Emperor for a commutation of the sentence, or even pardon. No one believes that the prayer will be granted, as no extenuating circumstances, realor imaginary havebeen found in his case. The execution will probably take place some day this week at the prison of -La Rog,uette, near Pere la Chaise, on the esplanade outside the gate.
The Persian Ambassador arrived here last night, and has taken up his quarters in a private house in the Champs Elys&es. He is accompanied by Mirza Zeman Khan, as First Councillor; Mirza Malcom, Second Councillor; Mirza Rim, First Dragoman; Mohamned Ali Aga, Second Dragoman; Marimak Khan, First Secretary; Mirza Ali Mejni, Second Secretary; irza Ebd Eassem Khan, First Writer; Mirza Hiussein, Second Writer; Mirza Riza, Doctor of Medicine; and Foquetti, Professor of Pharmacy of the College of Teheran. M. Duberstein, interpreter attached to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who had gone to Marseilles to meet the Ambassador, has returned with him to Paris. Feriik Klan has besides brought vith him 20 servants and six magnificent black horses. Groups of people stood near the door of the hotel nearlythe whole of the day, 'while the servants in their picturesque costume were arranging the baggage of the Ambassador.
The following despatch has been received :_
"1 BERNE, JAN. 18.
"The Royalist prisoners of Neuoh&tel, escorted by a detahment of Swimss troops commQanded by five officers, were conducted last night to the French frontier, which they crossed at Pontarlier. The Federal Council has given orders to immediately disperse the troops already ssembled; and General Dufour, in an order of the day of the 17th, has anuounced to the Helvetic army the pacific solution of the difference, adding, that the solution in question protects the interests, the dignity, and the honour of Switzerland.'
The present may be regarded as a dull season in Paris, and there is not much business doing in commercial quarters. The year 1857 is commencing, however, in one respect, under favourable auspices. There is but a small stock of goods in the hands of the manufacturers, and they are accordingly replenishing their stores while waiting future orders. These orders, it is hoped, wiiU not be long delayed, inasmuch as the French export trade has been languishing for some months past, in consequence of the financial crisis which has been more or less felt throughout Europe. Several manufacturers have been assured that they would receive large orders for Russia if the Russian Government could be induced to modify their Customs tariff. The existing duties are so exorbitant that theprincipal French articles used at St. Petersburg are smuggled into Russia. It isverywellknown atMfarseillesthatacarcely a captain of a merchant vessel arrives there from Odessa but has orders for some expensive articles of French millinery and silks. In fact the Russians, since the peace, have been the best foreign customers at Marseilles. The accounts from the manufactiuing towns in the provinces are not unsatisfactory. Several purchasers have appeared at Rouen and Mulhouse, and, were it not for the high price of manufactured goods, caused by the increased value of the raw material and the rise in workmen's wages, they might have effected large sales during the last week. Money has become more easy in Paris for commercial purposes. The continual losses which have been experienced fol some months on the ParisBourse have disgusted many speculators, who have foundto their cost that the slower mode of acquiring a fortune by legitimate commerce is in the end more certain. The Bank of France does not yet appear inclined to receive for discount commercial bills having 90 days to run, and stiRl less to reduce the rate of discount to five per cent. It is true that the limited state of its funds does not allow it to be very generous. Its cash in hand declined on the 8th inst. to 191,000,000f., and it is said to have fallen still lower within the last week. For these reasons the public are desirous that the Bank may be permitted to increase its capital. The eorn-market was firm last week, without any further rise in prices. The moment a rise of a franc or 2f. on a sack of flour was apparent there were numerous sellers to be found. The last accounts from the north indicate a tendency to a falL Buyers are to be found in the Paris market at 80f. for the sack of flour of 157 kilograinmes of the best quality. The trade is confined to the bakers, the speculators having large stocks on hand, which they purchased at higher rates than the present market price. The reserve of flour in the Paris stores has been reduced within the last eight days by 3,000 metrical quintals, and is now not more than 7,000 metrical quintals. A number of buyers from Lyons attended at the last Pariscorn-market. Ordinary and inferior qualities of wheat were chiefly sought for at an advance of 70c. the hectolitre. The millers, who have a sufficient stock on hand, made no purchases. Butehers' meat was never so dear in Paris as at present, and it still continues to rise.
There is not mueh businesa doing at the wine market of Berey, but wines of every quality maintain their price, although large quantties continue to arrive by the Orleans and Lyons railways. The high price and the scarcity of wines at Bordeaux have paralyzed al business there. Letters from Chalons-sur-Saone announee that a fall in prices is beginning to be perceived in the wine markets of Burgundy.
TheEmperor yesterday received CountKisseleff, the Russian Ambassador, and Baron de Brunow, who is on an extraordinary mission to Paris. A great number of foreigners of distinction were in theecourse of the day presented to their Majesties by the Papal Nuncio, the-Turkish and Russian Ambassadors, the American and Wurtemberg Ministers, and the Charge d'Affaires of Greece.
A Paris correspondent of the Nord of Brussels offers the following explanation relative to the reported changes in the organization of the Bank of France:-
"11f. Schneider, one of the governors of the Bank, has been requested to draw up a raport on the modifications which might be introduced into the statutes of that establishment iith respect to the extension of the charter, which terminstes in 188, to the year 1900; and to the increase of eapitl, which from 91,000,000 would be carried up to 259o000,000. This would allow the bank to dispose of a more considerable sum for makiDng r eports, or carrying over 3 per cent. stock, at the Bouxse at a lowv rate. That document will probably be submitted on Thursday to the Council of the Bank of France, whioh will deliberate on the two points with the view of obtaining a decision on the part of the Government."
The following private letter, bearing date the 11th of January, has been received from Naples:-
" After the explosion of the powder magazine a police

The object of the comnis.sion is 9 find out a grand conspiracy conectd with the atUenspt of Milano and the two explosions. They have Adrefdl set to work. 3More than 100 persons have been *Aested, of course Iiberals, among 'whom I know Ciuccio Aetdinand MasseiiiS, Bardate, ex-magistrate, Cascia, Gargen'
,IfnO, Mattici, M-ani, and Ginseppe Costebili, who had just beea released from prison. Allthese persons have been throwxt into dungeons without examination, and without being aware of the cause of their arred. It is rnmoured that the Government has discovered the authors of the ex. plogion of the Carlos IIL in the commander of the ship, -*e ofaicers, and in fact all who had escaped the explosion. It is also reported that the seamen have spoken, and indi. .cted the criminals paid by the English. the Royal 4 lhs aa the oourtiera say ttb it ias nceary to iSnih any cost 'with the English, and to toap6l Uth depatrire

the part of those people onthe honour of England. Altera delay of seven days, the official journal has at last spoken. 'We re happy,' it says, 'to be able to announce tba'i several persons (33) were saved by the boats of the Erglish corvette in the bay. The Count of Aquila sent immnediately (after five days) one of his officers on board the &[alacca to tbank the commander.'
"On Friday evening, the 9th, the police invaded five coffeehousas-namely, the Colonna d'Oro in the Toledo, that of the Piazza di Gerolamini, two in the square of Capo di Napoli, and one inthe Vicaria-moreover five estaminets for shopkeepers and a pastrycook's establishment. I will mention to you what took place in the Cafe de Ia Colonna d'Oro when I myself was present. In the others it was pretty much the same. At 8 o'clock in the evening Gondi, Commissery of Police, followed by a strong patrol of sbirri and Gendarmes, presented himself in the caf6, placed sentinels at all the doo rs, and commenced a search. He began by taklng the names of the persons present, rwkich he wrote down in a pocketbook. A Frenchman, named Aillaud, was among them. 'Who are you? asked the Commissary of Police. ' Well, I realy forget my name,' was the answer, 'but you wi find it here,' and 31. AillaUtd presented him his passport. The Commissary bit his lips, and let him go. He then searched the pockets and the hats of every one present, caused the arms of every one to be bound with cords, and, escorted by tho abirri and the Gendarmes, made them traverse the city, and lodged them in the prison of the Vicaria. A crowd followed the prisoners. The cafes were shut up, and on two of them appeared a notice, 'Closed by order of the police.' More than 100 persons were thus arrested. On the folloWing morning a printed placard appeared on the walls with these words,-' The faction which call itself the Government arrests the whole city. Patience ! Thehour of the tocsin for vespers will arrive.' Out of these arrests the Government will get up a trialto be displayed to the eyee of :Europe, which wll somewhat raise the courage of the Royalists.
" On the following night the city was deserted and the caf6s empty. The gas has been turned off from a part of the Royal Palace, from the Theatre of San Carlos, and that of the Fonda, as an explosion Is apprehended. The theatres are to be closed for three days, the 1lth, 12th, and 13th, in order to avoid a demonstration which wAs prepared in them for the 12th, the King's birthday. To-morrow, the 12th, the Royalists are expected to make a demowstration of affection for their ' dored Sovereign.' The word has bean sent round for all honest men to keep within doors; the streets will be deserted. Many families have already quitted their houses in the Raue de Toledo.
" At Penta, province of Salerno, a person ;ammed Petrone chanced to make some remarks about the King in a caf6. The gendarmes made an attempt to arrest him, but a priest, a brother of Petrone, issued out with a poignard in his hand, attacked the gendarmes, klled one of them wounded three, and put the rest to flight. The whole family at once quitted the place, and repaired to the mountains. In this country those who would enjoy liberty must lead the life of brigands. It is a civil war without a truce. A hundred persons are released from prlson to-day, but 200 are arrested the next. The official journal of the 10th says:-' Cherishing in ourRoyal soul the desire of improving more and more the condition of the prisoners, and wishing that their moral shall not be inferior to their material improvement, we decree that the moral and religious direction of those who are detained in prison is 'intrusted to the rev. fathers of the Society of Jesus. One of the rov fathers shall form part o' the Commission of Prisons, and will have a deliberative voice in the examination of affairs.'
" On Saturday and Sunday last 10 more coffeehouses were shut up. In all 400 persons have now beein arrested Bianchini has sent in kis resignation. In Sicily two parties of refugees have landed. The police have arrested a person named Pellegrini. The others are safe in the island, and are preparing another insurrection."
A letter from Turin of the 15th inst. announces that the inhabitants of Milan have subscribed a considerable sum of money to raise a monumaent to the honour of the Sardinian army. This monument is to be erected on one of the public places at Turin. The sculptor, Vincenzo Vela, has been appointed to execute this monument.
The inhabitants of Lombardy have sent the amount of their first subscription for the 100 cannon of Alessandria, with the following address
" To THE P2mzaoroxs.
"During these days, when people endeavoured to impose on us the obligation of enthusiasm, when all sorts of sacrifices are demanded ofus-and the most cruel, that of being wanting in national dignity-the Lombards, wishing to give a striking proof of their real sentiments, offer for the present to the Piedmontese the sum of 7,000f. for the 100 cannon of Alessandria, at the same time expressing a desire that the following inscription shall be placed on the guns supplied with this money:-' La Lombardia con vol.'
" Generous brothers! think or us, compelled to rejoice in our misfortunes, when a mendacious press will tell you that our festivities are spontaneous !"
A private letter from lIadrid of the 12th inst. says:-
"' The financial situation of the Government is anything but flourishing. It can hardly be otherwise vith extraor. dinary expenditure and extravagance. The current revenue and the 60,000,000 of the MiLres loan have been quickly spent, and the Government are now trying to negotiate the remaining millions, which are to be delivered in subsequent instalments. This will, of course, be an additional burden on the Treasury. Bat what of that? At the same time there is some intention of discounting the promissory notes (Pagares) of the purchasers of national property, which be come due at fixed periods for 10 years, as one bf the condi. tions of the sale. I fear much that when the day comes for a change of Government the public coffers will be pretty much in the condition they were in previous to the revolu. tion of 1854.
" In a former letter I mentioned that General Narvaez would seize the first opportunity of sending out of Madrid some of the generals of whom he is apprehensive. Prim gave him the chance he wished for. On the other hand, Prim wanted some such incident to recover the good graces of his friends, 'which he forfeited since 1844, when he showed himself too energetic against the Junta Central Prim'ssecretary and aide-deocamp, who had accompanied him to the East, have been also ordered out of Madrid. The Ministerial journals have been uttering for the last few days certain threats, which indicate that the Govermnent intend having recourse to new and very violent measures. Arrests have been made in several of the provinces for the purpose of intimidation and of preventing a conflict on the re-establishment of the octroi duties.
"I spoke some time ago of the manner in which the Court was received at the opera. Flrst, the publio hissed when the orchestra struck up the Royal 3March. The police who were stationed in every part of the theatre, arrested several persons, and then the public began to applaud furiously, and, of coarse, ironically; but many of those who applauded were also arrested Now, instead of applauding or hissing, the public began to cough in chorus; and, as the police cannot prevent people from catching cold, it will be curious to see how they will try to put down coughing. When the arrests were made for applauding several respect. able persons among the audience, who, in all sincerity and without any evil intention, manifested their admiration of this or that musical passage, were confounded' with the mal. contents, and were also taken ap and detained several hours in custody..'
"There has been a good deal of agitation to-day in Madrid. The troops remain umder arms in their barracks. Proclamations to the army have been sent about in profusion, offering the soldiers their finl discharpe from military service if they retire to their homes. One regiment in particular is spoken of as regarded with great suspicion. The officers are incessantly watched. The Government would not be sorry that a rising should be attempted ; its repression would give them more strength; but while their agents do everything to promote it they fear that it may extend too far, and that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to put it down."

CONSTANTINOPLE, JAX. 9.
On Wednesday last,t the th Inst., another Conts 0f
rence waa hLeld vt thed, IWnenh Ebfirey on the firmaa tof. be Isnd lnotthe eonyocat,oa ohe Divanx ad hoc is~ Dnubia ~riipa1it Th&object of itwas the~ssl oasesi01 ~woZed~thjeatwch14 Ona da sed poit by thet 7th the fa~neots conferecs I wr ,I nesad the hatof ilwskind.
Thero will be, indeed, some more oonferences, in whichtheCommisioners are to partUipate,but these will be taken up rather -with giying the necessary explanations on the spitit of the whole document and hearing any observations which members of the Commission may think fit to make, than with any discussion on the tenour of the firman itself.
*It is scarcely necessary to speak of the propriety of conferesnces in which the Commission should take part, for it is self-evident. It wil be the Commission who will have to work with the Divans, and see that the firman is carried out in the spirit in whici it was conceived. Besides, the firman is drawn up in such general terms that it will be the affair of the Commission to fill out all details; it becomestherefore essential that those who drew up the firman and those who have to carry it out should ceme, if possible, to a previous understanding, or else false positions canuot be avoided. As it is, the position ii awkward enough, because undefined. The Ambas.
eadors, being the accredited representatives of theiGovernments at thePorte, were of course the personi
who had to discuss the firman witn the Turkish. Ministers; but howr will it be when the Commission has once gone to the Principalities ? There are there likewise agents of the different Governments who are the means of communieation with the local Governments of those countries, and who are under the jurisdiction of the Ambassadors at Constantinople. Now, should any. difference. |aise on the interpretation of the firman, who will I be the judge between the two parties, and is it not
to be apprehended that collisions must ensue which will retard the organization of Moldo-Wallachia? It would be therefore desirable that the relative position of the Commissioners and the accredited regular agents of the Governments should be, as far as possible, accurately defined.
A short time ago the students of the Polytechnic School In one of their walks through the fields, entered a French burialground, and amused themselves with breaking down the cross and defacing the inscriptions,which in their ownlanguage aikedall passers-by to respect the remains of those who had died in their country's service. This is so much the maore to be regretted as it is the only case of the kind which has occurred, the numerous burialgrounds of the alied armies having been always religiously respeted; it reflects ratner a bad light on the spirit of a military establishment organized on a European footing. The French Ambassador made a strong representation, on the subject, and having proved the outrage, asked for the dismissai of the professor who was accompanying the students, and who had been himself educated in that institution; he insisted on the officer in charge of the students being degraded, and on the whole elass being punished, all which demands were immediately satisfied by the Seraskier, Riza Pasha. This has caused great discontent in the whole school, not so much on account of the punishment itself as because the French Ambassador, instead of leaving the punishment in the hands of the competent authorities, should have specified the manner of the punishment himself.
The Polytechnic School brings me to the subject of the army in general, which requires a few remarks. The last cannon shot was scarcely fired when the Turkish Government hastened to reduce the army. You must know that the Turkish soldier has to serve 12 years, of which he passes the first five in the active army, and the remaining seven in the Rediff, or militia, which is only called out in time of war. The first step, therefore, was to send these latter back to their homes. But, besides this, even the greater art of the active army had served their time, anJ had, now that the war was over, a claim to be dismissed likewise. Tho Government, although usually not very particular on the subject, was unanimously so on this ocsion, and sent away almost all those who had servedtheir time, without even waiting for the recruits who were to replace them to come in. The result of this is, that most of the regiments are frightfully reduced, and that it is not at all uncommon to find companies of from 6 to 10 men. This hasty and inconsiderate reduction tends very much to destroy whatever organization existed before in the army; while, if the thing had been done gradually, the recruits, who are, perhaps. easier formed into soldiers than those of any otherceountry, would have had an opportunity to acquire something of the spirit of the old soldier. We have the effect of this hurry under our eyes. The 4th Regiment of Constantinople, which I remember as one of the crack regiments of Omar Pasha's army, and which was inferior to no European regiment in drill and discipline, is now scarcely to be recognized before the guardhouses of Constantinople,
Besides the breaking up of the old spirit in the army, this hasty reduction has other drawbacks. The disturbances in Montenegro made the concentration of a considerable force necessary in Albania, and the brigandage about Monastir, and in Epirus and Thessaly, gave occupation enough to the army of Roumelia, so that scarcely any troops remained for the whole Danubian line. I can tell you, on the authority of a well-informed English officer, who lately inspected the whole line, that for the extent of 400 miles, comprising four first-class and sx second-class fortresses, the entire number of the garrisons does not amount to more than 1,500 or 1,600 men. Now, it is all very well to trust to the force of treaties, and show childlike confidence, but if there is no danger for the present nobody can say that the Danubian line wil not be required as a line of defence some time or other; and if all the means of defence-ramparts, guns, arms, ammunition, and stores-are left to fall into decay, all these things will be found wanting at the time of emergency, or will at any rate have to be replaced at an enormous cost.
You will easily believe that the means of defence on the whole line must fall into decay if I tell you that besides the guns which are in store there are rather more than 900 guns in position, so that there are not two men to one gun, Indeed, in many cases there is not one man, for, a good psit of the garrison being required in each place to do the honours to the commander, the rest must try to get through their duty as best they can. How is this possible with 500 lmen at a place like Shumla, or 200 at Widdin ? And all these inconveniences arise from a wrong, principle of economy. The finances are shattered, it is true, but it is not in this way that any result can be obtained. The soldier is nowhere a cheaper article than in Turkey, and the General officer nowhere a dearer, and at the same time more abundant, commodity. There are numbers of thema who squander the pay of many a soldier doingnothinginConstantinople. Thereductionought to be made there, and, in general, in all the waste tha-, isgoing on in thedepartments of the centralGovernment. If all the useless hangers-on with rich sine. cures were sent away it would, without exaggeration, enable the Government to maintain twice as large an army.
AS far as I can ascertain, no news of a positive acceptance of the bank proposal of the Government has as yet been received by Messrs. Wilkins from their directors. In the mean time, the Turkish Government is endeavouring to bring about a fusion between the company whose agents have accepted tho proposals and the Ottoman Bank. At the prasent moment this is scarcely feasible, as the coaditions proposed, are so vague in themselves that everythling must depend on the arrangement of details. For instance, one of the most essential poiuns -the amount of notes the bank will be allowed to issue in proportion to its capital and to the bullion deposited-is left blank.
L Yr. ayard, M.P., left Constantinople on Wednesday last, on his route to England. His railway project, connecting the Danube with the Arch.- pelago, wbich I mentioned in one of my last letter*, may be considered as settled. It has passed aU the series of councils, has the consent of the Grand Vizier, and the Irad6, which is already drawn u.,' has only tobe signed by the Sultan. It will be sent after him as soon as this is done. That this railwdy excites great hopes you may judge from the circumstauce that 1,000,0001. sterling has been subscrib-A in the place. This is a betterguarantee for its paying than the6 or 6 per cent. which the Turki-h Government could have been made to proxiie.
The only engineering diffMculties will be the Balk n road. The two higher passes of Irnowo and the Demir Kapu pass are out of the question, for they wouldrequire colossal works. Thereremain the third and most direct pas of Karnabad, the Nadir Derbend pass, and the route by Cae Emineh to Bourgas on the sea shore. As none of these passe have ever been surveyed with the view to a railway it would be impoible to say anything certain, but that near the sa shore would appeaii at firEt sght the moat pracgcable, the only difficul:y otlRcd being the p omntory to the south of the DBy of *Yarna and Cape 3Xi~ino, Uall the rest being JeTol sea shoe. to Bour from thee aa& eay

A Swiss Ultramontane colony has obtained such a firm footing in Germany, and has such powerful protecttors here and elsewrhere, that a paper which is said to receive a "subvention" from this Government can venture to publish such an artiole as the following:-
"HOW A CROWN WAS INTRXD M INR m Y 1857.- Ia 1842FrederickWilliam IV. went toNeuchAtel and received the homage of thepeople as ,Prince of Neuehltel and Count of Yalangin! The Swis Confederation sent an embassy to congratulate the Sovereign on his having taken posses. sion of a crown inherited frotm bis ancestors, and guaranteed to him by the treaties of 1814 and 1815. In 18 there was an insurrection in Neuchatel, a Demo. cratic Government was formed, the Prince was deposed, the Swiss Confederation made common cause withr the new Administiation, and guranteed the Democratic Constitution. Frederick William IV. appealed to the great Powers, who, in 1852, unanimously recognized his rights in the Principality of Neuchatel. In 1856 the &faithfil' inhabitantS of Neuchttel rose in rorder to reconquer the rights of their Sovereign, but they were overpowered by the Democratic party, imprisoned, and treated as traitors.

The following intelligence from Venice may be of interest to such readers as take an interest in the sayings and doings of crowned heads. While the Emperor was at Venice above 10,000 petitions were presented to him, and the majority of them he received with his own hands while walking out to visit the public institutions. One day, a Es Mlajesty
3wa entering the Church of St. Zachariah, two girls, of 14 and 16 years of age, asked to be permitted to tell him what they wanted. The Monarch gave his |aconsent, and Ias informed tha the petitioners were reduced to the greatest distress, as their father had been put into prion for a debt of 400 lire (about 13L 7s.), and had already beon absent from his home a fortnight. The Emperor paid the debt, and by doing so probably saved the
ies from perdition. As their Majesties were leaving their gondola, near the iron bridge, in order to go to the Academy of Fine Arts, a beggar-womaw put her hand on the shoulder of the Empress. sh soon as Her Majesty turned the old woman fell on her knees before her, blessed her, and kissed the hem of her dress. As the Emnperor and Empress were leaving the Church of St. canthony, at Padua
were separated from their suite by the crowd, so completely shut in that they could neither advance nor retreat. "My very good friends," said the EmperorinItalian, " prayoletme and myTwife pass." cioom was made as rsoon as the words were spoken.
Their Majesties were at La Scala, the great Milan theatre, last night, but we have not yet heard what kind of reception they met with.
According to an eye-witness, the Brescians were "abominably frosty" when the illustrious travellers entered their cit y.

The Grand Duke Constantine returned hither on Friday evening from Hanover, spent yeaterday in the circle of the Royal Fmsily, and wil return to hanover this evening. Prince Friedrich Wflhelm returned also from Breslau to be present yesterday at the mariage of one of his adjutants, and wbl rema ihere forafewday. Prince Albrecht of Pressiarnd his son have also repaired to Berlin, like the other Princes just mentioned, for the purpose of being present at the festival which is at this time being celebrated at the palace, viz., the Ordensfest, whic a ways held on the 18th of January or the Sunday next following. This day is the anniversary of the founidation of the Prussian kingdom in 1701, whenrthe Elector Friedrich II., of Brandenburg, took the liberty of crowning himself at cirnigberg as King in Prussia. It was not til after the first partition of Poland, when the remainder of the territory that had formerly belonged to the Teutordc Order came into the ponsession of Frederick the Great, that the title of e ing of Prassia was assumed. History tells of this iirst Eing iwh
Prussia, Friedrich in, a vain ostentatious man, that on December 16, 1700, he informed the various Powers of Europe by a circular despatch of his intention to promote himself to the rank and dignity of a King; and c th e very next day-so inpatient was he for the ceremony-he set off from iBerlin for Eonigsberg with a fearfully enormous cortege, in which no less than 30,000 horses figured. By dint of greast exertioon n the part of this numerous equine force the cavalcade, which was divided into four sepaate portions, succeeded in reaching E6nigsberg in 12? days, a distiance now traversed by railway in 19 hours, and there it was that on the 18th of January, 1701, the Elector Friedrich Il f. O Brandenburg assumed the title of King in, Prussia as Friedrich IL This passion for the kingly title cost the country, for the expense of the coronation alone, 6,000,000 thalera (900,0001.); every button on Friedrich's dress cost 3,000 ducats, the clasp on his purple mantle cost 100,000 thalers, -and the croAwn, which was worn
atop ot a stately full-bottomed wig, was set with large single dianonds all over the hoops. The crown jewels worn by the Queen were valued at 3,000,000 thalers, and the sceptre which the King wore was a present to him from Peter tho Great, who had not many years before come to Beriin in the suite of his own Amabassador. What a contrast between the simplicity of the great man and the ostentation of the little one !

This was an Appeal from a decree of Vice-Chaueellor Stuart. The bill was filed by the official assigee of Peter So werby, decea, wed ho was declared a bankrupt in the year 11. Pazaeter aopperby obtned his certificate, and in the month of January, 11, made his will, whereby, inter Coia, he directed his execxtors (the defendants), within three years from the date of his deeaye, topay unto thle official Assignee of hiis banVrutcy, in trust to pay all the creditors who had proved their ebts, so much money as would make the dividend equal to 20s. in the pound. The claim made |by the plaintiff wasfor 3,10Dn., which the executors refused

Corley said that the ring upon her finger belonged to him, and told her that a marriage h taken place. He also at the same request read the evidence as to desftruction of documentg, consising of what Mr. Corley had himself sworn-namelv, that Crump had, after his wifes death, handed to him a packet of his own letters, few in number-four or five; be had destroyed them th t were very short letters, ando ntained maerely Inquiries Iatr her health and other matters of a personal nature.

was plain that the agreement was not limited to 2,0001., althou that sumn was mentioned ir the original memorandum. ft was equally clear that if it wrere confined to 2 0001. Mnr. Campbell never so understood it, or agre tusts i should be so, for in all her letters in which the settlement was mentioned she spoke of -her property being left to her " as before her marriage." n ven Mr. Corley himmel in some measure so treated it, for he did go to the bankers and utrtorize them, bafter the marriage, to honour her checks as it she were sugle, and did not limit that authority to atein., bthe ilt it general over the whole 8,0001. Then, assuming that to be the ar rcsult of the whole evidence, the next question would he upon what trusts the settlement was to be The eression, in the acn ement, "as if unmarried," and Thee liner letter, "cmine to use and to will," showed that there was to be a trast-an executory trust-for her benefit, and if the correspondence were laid before any conveyancer in Lincoln's-inn as instrucetions for a settlement he would have drawn it so as to give a life estate in the interes for her separate use to the wife, with A power of appointment to her over the capital, and in default of appoitment the capital to go to her next-of-
in. No inxteresb would in such a case bo given to the husband, becauso the husband did not bring any money into settlement. Her letters showed that she considered she had made ample provision for him under the truts of he-r father's will. The learned counsel cited several cases to show that where A professional man acts for another he is bound to show that he fuly explained the matter, and if he could not doh s everything should be presumed against him. He cited "1Montesque v. Sandys" ftSegrave v. Curwen," "Bulkely .Iifod Anote

which had not been seen by Mr. Corley.7 Mr. Church, the solicitor for Mr. Corley, said that Mr. Poulden bed in his posse-ssion, Among other parcels,a packet of letters of aMr. Corley, arked, "to be destroyed After my eath," or.some such superscription.
Mr. Poulden, inL answer to a question from the Court, said he had eight or nine boxes, and which mnost probably all contained letters. Of one of those boxes Mr. Camnpbel had the key.
Mir. Campbell admitted he had the keys of all.
The COURT ordered the boxes to be brought to-maorrow (this morun) andathe keys of them to be handed over by MIr. Campbe/
Mr. GREENE then proceeded with the evidence to show, first, that the lady kept the entire control over her property to the last; and, secondly, that down to 1850, notwithstanding the former causes of offence, she entertained a very strong maternal affection towards her son. The learned counsel then prooeeded to argue that it was shown that the lady lived aU her life, vwith occasional exceptions, when her son's conduct was such as not to mect her approval, upon terms of the wrarmest affecotion with Mr. Csanpbell,-ax affection only interrupted by her connexion with Mr. Corley. The other side would contend that there was evidence of various actsof violence and impropriety on the part of Mr. Campbell, but it was plain upon the evidonce that she always forgave him and treated him with the utmost partiality and fondness. From 1845 downwards Mlr. Corley was on terms of great intimacy with the lady, and, being a widower, obtained the means of so influencing her that he became the participator in her income of 8001. a-year, and a life income inthe property left by her father; and, as he hoped, the absoluteoowner of her savings, amounting altogether to about 8,0001. Thisgwasdoneby xaggerating the vices and follies of her son, and then inducing her to believe that he would be the best protector of that son. The learned counsel commenteA at length upon the fact of Mr. Corley having kept back letters of Crump addressed to him until the hearing of this cause on Saturday last, although ie had sworn in both this suit and in that of "Corley v. Lord Stafford," that he had produced all the docaments in his possession, custody, or power, showing that all reliance upon his testimony was vain. As to the amount alleged to have been agreed to be settled being confined to 2,0001., there was no evidence of Mr. Corley.
Mr. DANrnL.-On the contrary, in his answer which is in evidence, he says that the difference between Kim and the lady did not relate to the being married in a chapel or not, but to the amount to ho settled under her own control, and that was the reason why the sum of 2,000 fwas mentioned in the original document.
Mr. Daniel commenced his Address for Mr. Corley; but it seems to bo more convenient to give it hereafter entire.
Mr. Southgate is on the same side.

This case came before the Court for the purpose of vary. ing an alleged directron in a decree made by hts Honour at the hearing of the cause. The case had reference to certain policies of insurance, to the amount of about 20,0001., on the life of Lord Huntingtower, to secure a debt of 9401. owing by him, and the Court had directed the deed assigning thoee policies to be set aside on paymuent by Lord Hluntingtower of the money he had bond fide recoived. It was now contended that a direction had been subsequently attached to the decree by the Court that certain account should be taken as to the premiums and payments on the policies in question, and the plaintiffs as representatives of Lord Huntintower, now sought to have this direction with. drawn, and the order to go merelr for all patties to be restored to the position they held before the execution of the deed, which had been declared invalid.

THE GRBAT LUXmOURG RAILVAY COMrPANY V.
3rAGYAY.
The biUl in this case alleged that Sir William Maeuay, while president and manager of the Great Luxembourg Railway Company, became, m conjunction with Alderman Moon and others, one of the concessionaires of another Belgian line of railway, known as the " Grand Junction;" that Alderman Moon and the other concessionaires having retired, Sir W. Magnay became gole concessionaire of the Grand Junction; that Sir W. Magnay ad. vised the Great Luxembourg to purchase the con. cession of the Grand Junction, and that towards such purchase the directors of theGreatLuxembourggaveto Sir illiam Magnay, astheirpresident, 5,000. worth of their shares that the Grand Junction Railway had turned out a failure, and that Sir William Mapay had kept the shares of the Luxembourg Railway for his own use, and refused to account for them. This the diroctors of the Great Luxem. bourg Railway contended he had no right to do, inasmuch as he had obtained the shares in his fiduciary character as predent of their railway, and could only make use of them according to the resolutions of the company, which had been passedfor hisguidance withrespect tothem. Inanswer tothee allegations and this contention Sir W. Magnay dehied his right to accoent to any one for the shares he had received, inasmuch as they were given to him as sole concessionaire of the Belgian Grand Junction Railway, and the directors of the Luxembourg delivered them to him with the perfect knowledgo that he was such sole concessionaire, and with the sole object of paying him part of the purchaso-moneyfor the toncession they desired. To the sufficioncy of this answer the plaintiffs now excepted, and
His HoNous allowed their exoeption, giving the defenI dant time to put in a more complete answer.

And in the tbird letter the testator, writlng to Mrs. Kay, after refusing to execate a post obit bond to leave his son 5,000. it hit decease, and after stating his propoBas as to his son's settlement, said, "And finally to recognize my son in common with the rest of miy famill in the future provisione of iny will." The sm settled by the testator on the plaintiff, Irrespective of other property comprised iin the plaitiff's marriage settlement, Amountedto 3,6004, and the testator exededTabout 1,0004. in furnishing the plaintiff's house on his marrage, which took place in November, 1832. The testator haa snven children, and it was stated that he had given about 9,00. in his lifetime to one of his sonf, Charles Kay. The only interest taken bytheplaintiffand Charles'Kay under the testator's w wbich was dated in l841,was arcontingent reversionary iWterest in eertain pre r the teatator's residuary pro=~ ha-dng been dips~bty" hti-m for the benefit of h other five children and their isse. By a codicil, however, dated in 1846 the tebDator gave to the plaintiff a sma of 2,5001. The value of the property given by the teator to his five children mentioned Io his will was about 7,0001. The plaintiff by his bill pyterdihnat It might be decaed that the a tetator, on the occasion of the plaintiffs marrage and in consideArtion thereof, entered into a contract with the plaintiff and his wife to leate to the plaintiff at his decease, besides and independlently of the sumi of 4,6001. or thereabouts, advanced, seted, or pad for the plaintiff's benefit on hi marriage, a share of his estate at least equal to the sharme to be taken by the testator's other children respectively, and that It vmght be declared that the slaintiff was entitled to demand and receive fromi the trusees and executors of the tetator's wil one equal sxth part of the teetator's residuary'pro. party for, i cas the Court should be of opinion that the plaintiff ws not entitled to a sixth of asuc residue, then that it mightbe declared that theplaintiff was entitled teia seventh part thereof, including tr amnount advand by the tesontorto Charles Kay.

site forthei w t he cn tiff M v er. Bacon and Mr. Litteforhooterdeen ts were not calledaupon.
The VimCnx-CucxLon said that the bill was filed byr the plaintiff, who claimed as against the estate of his father, the tesator i the cause, ma povision ir mpursueance of an agreeas ent Alleged to 'ao been made prior to and i consideration of his marriage. The agreament was said to be contained in letters, one of which was addressed to the plaintifs intended iother-in.law. According to the plaintiff's construction of that latter it
imounted to a representation by which the testator engaged, in consideration of his mharraget that he would
tek eaprovision y will i for the plaintiff e to that which he mnight mae for mhs other children. thare could be no doubt that if prior to the plaintiffs marriage amre presentation had been made on this subject sufficiently ceretain and defint e and if the arriage had taken place on the faith of that representation, it would have bound the testtoer. The law on this subject was clearly stated by Lord Cottenham in 12 CL. and Fin. 62. His Lordship waq; there reported to have said, "A representation madohee don party for the purpose of influencing the condute of the ether party, and Acted on by binm, -will in general be sufficient to entitle him to the as pranAe of a court of equity for the purpose of realizing such representation;" and Lord Campbell, at p. 8es Id., said, "It seems Lord Cottenham was s~peakinig of negotiations in referenceoto marriage."1 According to that doctrine, if theplaintiff could show a representation made before his marriageby hisfather, as tothesamountof propertywhich the ltter would leave him byhiswl, the plaintiff was entitled torsuoas againstbhis father'srepresentatives tolhavethatrepresentation mSad good. There must, however, be areasonable certaintyas totemountof the
isin to be made. Here the documentary evidence trely failed in establishing the plaintiff's case, and the 'three ifferent aspects under which the plaintiff, in'the prayer of his bill, soumht relief, showed the difficulties under wbich the plaintiff fe t he laboured. The question for the consideration of the Court was 'wether the provision mande by the testator, under his wil and codicil, for the laintiff was asufficient performance of his promisenthat he wA recognize the plaintiff in common with the rest of his family in the future provisions of his 'will" He was of onDnion that it was. In the present case there was not that invredient of certainty as to the anountlof the provision to be made which was mainly relied en in theHammsly v. De Bied," 12 Cl. and Fin but here there was morely a loose and vcage promise ofx thes part of the testator that be would re0otitize theo lIIntiff in. common with the rest of his famoly in the future provisions of his willtHe thought there had been a fair and liberal performance of that promise, and he mustdeclare tbhatit had been sufficiently fulfilled bv the pro. visin the testator had made for the plaintiff by his wi and codicil.As the testatin r had hansecreated the difficulty 'which had arisen, the costs of all yparties, as between solicitor and clent, must come out of his estate, the plaintiff being one of his executors.

The agreemIent 'was entred into in 1t47, ancd the coman y 'took possession at once under it.

The vendor replied that be could only make a possessory title, and that if the company were not satisfied with it they had better pay the purchase money Into court, under the 76th sec f on of the rands Clauses Act, asd leave the vendor to get it out as he best might. The company replied that this would be the better course, but afterwardg stated that they had been advised that a good title could notbi e thus mLdetha claim having ben made to the and on behalf of the re

(Sitin9s at Nisi Prius, at GuildhaU, before Mfr. Justice
WILLXS and a Common Jury.)
RANElr V. PAYNE.
This was the first of the causes set down as " defended" ia the list for to-day, but when it was caUed on no counsel appeared for the defendant.
Mr. ROBINSON, on behalf of the plaintiff, stated that the action was brought to recover a sum of 501. alleged to be due for the services of the plaintiff in having introduced a gentleman of rank and influence as director to " The Western Bank of London," in accordance with an agree. inent entered into with the defendant to the effect that he, the plaintiff, was to have 501. for every fit and proper person whom he might succeed in inducing to become director of such bank.
The case for the plaintiff having closed,
Mr. Justice WILLEs said, that he was of opinion that the contract proved was tainted with illegality, and as the illegality was of a. nature to affect the public he Ehould take advantage of the 19th section of " The Common Law Pro. cedure Act, 1854," by which it is provided that it shall be lawful for the Court or judge at the trial of any cause where they or he may deem it right for the purposes of justice to order an adjournment for such time and subject to such terms and conditions as to costs and otherwise as
they ore may think fit; and as he (the learned judge) thought,|pat in the present case such course would further the ends of justice, he should adjourn the trial of this cause to the second sittings for London (next Tuesday), in order that he might consult his brother judges as to the propriety of interfering, although the defendant did not think fit to appear.
* Mr. ROBINsox begged to be allowed to say a few words on the point, but Mr. Justice Willes refused to hear him - however, at a later period of the day, in answer to an aPplication made by the learned counsel that a verdict should be taken for the plaintiff, subject to the result of his Lordship's determination as to the illegality of the transaction,
Mr. Justice WILLES; said, that at this time, when so many were most probably ruined by having had transactions with the Royal Bntish Bank, he thought that the occupation of entrapping men to lend their names to bubble schemes was one which should be looked upon 'with suspicion, to
Mr. llonnrsox.-This, my Lord, is no bubble scheme; it Is now in full operation, and but that we have before us iustances of apDarently safe banks failing, I should say that the Western Bank of London is secure. We have the gentleman here who was induced by the plaintiff to become a director; he will say he was not entrapped, and that he is now a director. The concern is at work and quite firm.
Mrf. Justice WILLS.-You must give the defendant notice that this cause will be taken next Tuesday. and in the meantime I wil consult my brother judges as to 'what ought to be done. The defendant has only pleaded the general issue, and it is a question 'whether I should not ailow him to add a plea which will raise the point of fraud and illegality.
We abstain from reporting the evidence adduced on the present occasion, as it was entirely ex parte, but as the case was in the course of the afternoon finaUy adjoured until Tuesday next, if the defendant appears we shall be able to give what is said on each side of the question.
MILLS V. PROCRTER.
Mr. Laxton apoeared for the plaintiff; Mr. O'Malleyland Mr. W. G. Harrson were for the defendant.
This was an action brought by the plaintiff to recover frona the defendant the sum of 501. for the tuition, Szc., of the son of the latter as an agricultural pupil for, half a year. It appeared that the son of the defendant had been received 4t,6 the house of the plaintifffor the purpose of learning farming, and he was to pay for this and for board, lod ig &c., 10L0. a-year. A day or two after the expiration of the first half-year he had been removed, and, although several letters had passed between the plaintiff and the defendant after the young man had left, no allusion was made to the supposed liability of Mr. Prockter to pay more than the fee or the half year during which his son had actually remnained with the plaintiff.
A t the conclusion of the case for the plaintiff
Mr. O'3LALLEY objected that he could not recover on the declaration as framed; it ought to have been in form for damages sustaned bythe plaintiff by reason of the defendant having taken his son away before the term agreed upon had e-xpird
Mr. Justice WILLESs saad that in any case, whether the aUegations contained in the declaration were proved or not, he thought the defendant had a very strong case, but that it was a pity that friends should quarrel, and the best way of ending tjhe matter was for the parties to consent to with-
fter some discussion this course was eventuaUy adopted. e efct is that each htigant pays his own costs.

* This was an action upon a guarantee given to secure the payment, by a person named Wilson, of 1091., for bricks sold to him by the plaintiff.

The defendant and Wilson swvore that the plaintiffsaid he would give Wilson ito custody if the security were not given.

COURT OF EX(flrYOTTR1T T on
Ah- RE TYtOMtAR r(,Pnq
(Suing in Banco )
Mr. M'OBumcY moved that Thomas Cross, who appeared in court in the custody of the gaolor of one of the city of London prisons should be discharged on habeas cornus. The return of the writ, which had beea granted during the term, set forth that the prisoner was detained under a conviction of the LordMavor, for that "he on the 24th day of December inst., in this city, then being a suspected person and reputed thief, frequenting the public streets and places of and in the said city, then and there was found in 'Railway-place,' being a public thoroughfare, and one of the places of public resort of and in the said city, with intent feloniously to steal the goods and chattels of Jane Seymour," whereupon the said Thomas Cross was adjudged to be a " rogu and vagabond' within the statute 5th George IV., cnap. 83 and 84, and sentenced to be imprisoned for tbe space of three months.
The CsZF sAmON having inquired what the nature of the objection to the conviction was,
Mr. M'OuBenY stated that the conviction was defective on the ground that, while it professed to be founded on the Vagrant Act, it did not show on the face of it that any offence within that act had been committed. The third section was aimed against suspected persons found frequenting places of public resort with intent to steal, and a convction under that section ought to allege that tho offender frequented the place where he was found. Now, it might be that the prisoner had never been in Railway-placeo before the occasion in question.
Mr. Baron MARTIIN.-Do you contend that if a thief frequents Fleet-street for the purpose of stealing and seeing an opportunity to commit a felony in Bouverie-street, goes into that street and is there detected in the act, he cannot be convicted because he has not " frequented" Bouveriestreet?
Mr. AVoUBREY.-That was tho contention for the prisoner, and that principle of construction was in accordance with the recent decision of this Court in "The Queen v. Jones."
Mr. HiU appeared in support of the conviction, but was not called on.
The COURT being unanimously of opinion, that the facts and allegations set forth in the conviction clearly established an offence within the third section of the act, the prisoner must, therefore, be remitted to his custody.
Judgment accordingly.
JUDGMENT.-RABBER V. .JESSUP.
The CHIEF BARON delivered judgment in this case, 'which was an action against the clerk of the Waltham Local Board of Health, raising the important question vhether, on the peculiar facts set forth, the Tneral Health Act had been legaly appled to the pariah of Waltham; and if so, then, whether a certain highway rate made by the board could be supported? As to the first point, the Court was of opinion that, under aU the circumstances of the case, the act had been properly applied to the whole parish, and was not limited to the township of Waltham abbey, as the plaintiff contended. As to the second point, the defendant admitted that under recent decisions the highway rate could not be supported, but he relied on the statute, 17th of Victoria, passed for the purpose of curing the defect and indemnifying aU parties engaged iu collecting such illegal rates. That act Passed after the trial of the cause on which this case hv been framed, and the Court was of opinion that they were bound to give judgment on tbe footing of the law as it stood at the trial. and not with reference to an act passed in the meantime with the object of altering that law. There must, therefore, be judgment for the plaintiffin so far as the highway rate was concerned,
with costs.
Judgment accordingly.
KE31P V. COV5NQTO.
The CHn BAROX having delivered judgment in this ease also, the foUowing observations were made by the Court on the application of Mr. Lush for leave to appeal in reference to the much discussed case of
KiNGSFORD V. MERRY.
The C=mF BABON,-We must be cautious in granting permission to appeal. There was no misdirection in this particular case, and we decline to grant any leavo. In a recent case which has excited lreat public interest (';Kingsford v. Merry") the Court of :chequer Chamber has been supposed to have overruled my direction at the trial. The fast wa1s that the Court of Error did not overrule either my direction or the ruling of this Conrt, but by some mistake very much to be regretted, the case was presented to the faotof Ee on a totaUy erroneous'statement of the
Mr. Baron MARTI wished to confirm this statement. The case stated to the Court of Error in " Kingaford v. Merry," was totally different from the facts presented to my Lord on the trial, and to this Court on the argument of the rule, and is in itself nittorly unintelligible.
Mtr. Luss was glad that this application had given risEO to these statements to the Court, as there iad been great maisconception on the subject of "Kingaford v, Mlerry," which wvas very much to be regretted.
The Cmxa' BARON.-There can be no doubt of that, Whoever was to blame, there was a misstatement of the facts to the Court of Error in that case which operated greatly to the injury of the defendant. lf the facts of the case in "Kingsford v. Mferry"had been presented to the I ourt of Error correctly, and as they occurred in this court, there was no doubt that the decision of that Court would
lave been in accordance with that arrived at here. They were, however, different, and consequently the decision was different also. The consequence was that it was very desirable that the grounds of appeal should for the future be reduced into writing and submitted to the Court for its perusaL
The subject then dropped. and the Court proceeded with the new trial paper.

JUPP V. RICHARDSON AND ANOTHERt.
This was an action broughlt upon an alleged guarantee made by the defendants in the following letter:-
TSir,-Mr. Chapman, the builder ofkthe two housesaN OIL 18 and 19, Totty-stret. liethbas-green, has5 requete us to retain for you the amount for the time being due from im to you for timber. &c, out of the proceeds of the houses when vold; vith which request we Will COMMl. "Yours obediently.
RICHARDSON AN]D WANBEY.n
The defendants pleaded that they did not promise as alleged; then that the houses were not sold within the mneaning of the promise;' that they never received the said proceeds; and lastly, that subsequently to the making of the alleged promise and before the commencement of the suit, the plaintiff had absolved the defendants from their agreement.
Mr. Edwin James and Mr. Hawkins appeared for the plaintiff; hrr. Temple and Mr. Aspland for the defendants.
It appeared from the plaintiff's case that he was a timber merchant, and that the defendants were solicitors who acted as the agents of a Mr. Palmer, the ground landlord of certain property in Totty-street, Bethnal-green. A person named Chapman, who had taken a lease of part of the ground from Mr. Palmer, was desirous of procuring timber from the plaintiff, and required credit. The plaintiff said he would give him credit if he had a guarantee to secure
ltimate payment. The defendants accordingly gave the plainTUff the cetter in question. Upon the faith of that letter the plaintiff had supplied Chapman with timber to the amount of t 7h lSs. 4dci
the sum now sought to be recovered. Shortly after a mortgage of the houses was executed by Charpman to a Mnr. Roberts for a sum of 2601., and the plaintiffo smedi
ately applied to the defendants for payment of his claim. They, howsever, handed over 2S11. to lr. Palmer, their own client, in discharge of advances which he had made to Chapt man upon the houses, and the balance of the money received went in costs. On the plaintiff pressing them to settle his demand they denied their liability under the guaranteew The houses having been s ibsequently sold this action had beenbrought aganust the defendants to compel thema to fulfil their agreement.
Witnesses w ere called in support of the plaintiff's case.
The defence was that at the time whent th mortgage was made the plaintiff had been informed by the defendats that Mrr. Palmer would not complete the lease to Chapman unless he gave up all claim under the guarantee. The plaintiff, who would have had no hold upon tho propert anless the lease was completed, consented to wave 3 right under the guarantee, and upon that the lease was completed, and the 2501. was raised by mortgage, of which 2311. was paid to the defendants, not on Chapman's account but on account of money due to their client, Mr. Palmer. All power over the property in question had then been taken out of their hands, and the equity of redemption, which had been offered to the plaintiff, and was refused, had been sold for 251. by other attorneys.
Several witnesses having been called in support of this view of the case,
Mr. TEsPLE summed up the defendants' evidence. Mr. EDWVIN JAmys replied.
Mr. Baron BRAMIVEL, in summing up, asked the jury whether, in their opinion, the plaintiff had waved the whole or any portion of his right under the guarantee ?
The jury said they thought the plaintiff had waved his right under the guarantee only, so far as regarded the 2501. ra upon mortgage, but that he had done so because he coul not help himseihf
Mr.Baron BEAavLL said, upon that finding the verdict would be entered for the plaintiff on the second and fourth pleas, and for the defendant upon the first and third pleas, with leave to the plaintiff to move to enter the veraict for him for 251., or the amount olaimed.

COURT OF BANKRUPTCY, Basinghall-street, Jan. 20.
COUA1T OPBAiVKBU.PTCY. Basingza7Z-tlrcc4, Jan. 20.
IN RE J. L. DE: .TO(l .
(Before Mr. Comminsioner HomoyD.I
Tho bankrupt, a Dutchmen, is described as a general merehant, of Mark-ane. This was an examination meeting.
Mr. RoY said circumstances of an important nature arose out of this case. The bankrupt was one of a number of parties who had circulated, or assisted in circulating, a number of bills of exchange of the estimated amount of 36,0001, of which no satisfactory information could be ascertained. A small portion of these biUls (about 2,0001.) had been discounted by the London and Westminster Bank, for whom he now appeared. Thus far the bankrupt had kept his creditors at ann's length, and failed to furnish any satisfactory information in respect to a number of these bills, which, to make use of the proper term, were forgeries. Whether these bils were manufactured here by some one of the five or six firms whose names were connected with them, or whether they were issued from Anierica or France, it was desirable to ascertain. The bankrupt, as ono of the five or six finms, had taken a leading part in their circulation, and he must no longer be permitted to trifle with his creditors in respect to his knowledge of the extent of the bils so issued and what had become of their proceeds, for, as yet, all the six firms discaimed havim had any portion of the money which had been given for them. One man (Thomas Holand, tobacco-broker) had been mentioned particularly as connected with these frauds, but he was stated to be too ill to come to this court to pass his examination, and it had been ordered, after several adjounments, that his examination should be taken at his lodgings at Hampstead. If the bankrupt now before the Court (De Jonge) should persist in withholding information, his Honour would, be was sure, now begin to exercise his power, so that they might at length obtain some satisfactory information.
Mr. LucAis (who appeared for the bankrupt) said De Jonge was ready to give every assistance in his power, and he; would suggest an adjourment that some arrangement
Mr. RoY.-Let us have the information now.
Mr. Lue,As.-Now, or at a future meeting, whichever you
Mr. RoY--ovw, if you please. Where is De Jonge? The Bankrupt;-I am here.
The bankruptwas then examined. he stated that he petitioned this Cout for private arrangement on the 10th of September last, and that he had then farnished a statement of his creditors and his assets.
Mr. RoY said he now wished to be furnished with all the information the bankrupt could give in respect to a number of bils purporting to have been drawn by Walter, Lrving, and Co., of Bordeaux, and other parties in America.
The bankrupt said if they wished for information in respect to any particular bill he could give it, but he was not prepared to answer such general questions. The bils produced had all gone through the hands of his bankers. Tey included bils drawn by Walter Irving and Co. He had already furnished a statement.
Mr. ROY said the statement as yet furnished was a mere list of bills discounted by the London and Westminster Bank. What he wanted to know was who got the proceeds of those bills?
The Bankrupt.-My cashbook wil show that. Some of the bills Mr. Roy had referred to were drawn on Christian - others upon Barclay. He Sot them from Paris. It was al
explained in his books. he got them from Mr. George Bruck (a Dutchman), of Paris. They were enclosed in a letter from Bruck. Robed not that letter. He (bankrupt) acted in the transactions as agent for Holland. Could not state the date of Bruck's letter. It was in June last he received it. The bills were draughts by Walter Irvng and Co. upon the houses in London who accepted them. Took the bills produced (nine in number) in two lots to the London and Westminster Bank.' Bruck had written to HolLsnd. had not that letter, because he only acted as agent to Holland. Holland requested him to manage the transactions for him, and the bills belonged to Holland, who had the proceeds in the course of three or four days. He (bankrupt) influenced consignments from time to time toholland, and for which consignments Holland found the money. There were other bllUs received from Bruck.. Used to get Barclay to gve his acceptances, and he then handed the amount to Holland. Barclay used to ship leather to the Uinited States, and as he (Barclay} wated money ho used to supply him. HE used to receive setters from Bruck * -they were passed to Holland.
The CoMMnssro?sm.-.Have you tried to get the letters The Bankrupt.-Hvow could I?
The Coissssssxos\-*E-Have you made anyefforts to do so? The Bankrnipt.-No.
Examination continued.-His dealings were with Barclay. Knew Bruck personaDy. He used to live in Paris. Inquiries had been made after him. Did not know whether those inquiries had been successful, but had heard they were not successfuL He (bankrupt) had no dealings with Christian upon whom some of the bi ls woro drawn. Some of the bills that came through Bruck were drawn upon Barclay because Bruck knew who the hills were to be drawn upon. There was an understanding between him (bankrupt) and Barclay that Barclay was to accept hills. The proceeds were to go
Mr. ROY.-You have said Barclay was to have the benefit of them ?
The BanLrupt explained.-Holland asked him (bankrnut) if he supphed Bare y with money could he not draw bi
u n clay) sO as to refund himself? He said Barcay oaccept, and he supposed Holnd instructed his agent at Paris to draw upon Barclay.
Mr. Roy. -You have first said that the proceeds went to Bartclay atn?d next to Holland, How do you reconcile thwes
The bankrupt explained that he used to supply Barclay with money, but that the proceeds of these particular bills went to Holland.
Mr. ROY here called attention to the discrepancies in the banirupt's statements in a manner that caused Mr. Lucas to ren;rk that his client was treated with less consideration than if he were at the Old Bailey.
Mr. RoY.-E[e ought to be at the Old Bailey. I am not to be dictated to by the learned counsel as to the manner in which I shall examine the bankrunpt.
The Bankrupt.-You are conducting it so as to giveas much annoyance as you can.
Examxination eontmnued.-En October and Novennber, 1855, he discounted bills for Holland, whohad the proceeds. His cashbook showed that, in the cases where aolland bad the proceeds. His cashbook contained an account ef every bul-that was an account of every biU containing his endorsement.
Mr. RoY.-Your endorsement. I wish to testoneoparticular transaction.
The Bankrupt.-You are perfectlyvwelcome to do so.
Mr. Roy.- am taLing of the bills of rwhich you did not hand the particular proceeds to Holland.
The Bankrupt.-Point them out.
Alter references had been made to acceptances in favour
of Walter Irving and Co., by Von- der Haedes, and also by Christian,
The bankrupt said he was very anxious to give every possible information. He did not keep an account of certain transactions, not being his own. He didnot find in his correspondence-book so mauch as a copy of one letter between himself and Brack. Had seen Bruck frequently. and had known him for 10 or 12years. In 1845 Brucklived at Islington. He wasa general merchant, he should think. He was a general merchant at Islington, and was in corxespondence with a house at Amsterdam, and also one at Manchester. Had nothing to do with Christian's bills, except as agent. Holland got the bills accepted and brought theta to him. Some considerable amount of bills had passed through his hands. Could not guess the amount. It was no use to jump at a guess. The amount might be 20,0001 It never occurred to hismind to ask who Irving and Co.were. Bruck said it was a homse at Bordeaux. It was when in London that Bruck told him this. This was in December, 185.. It was since February, 1855, that he had commenced negotiating these bills, and 20,0004 had passed through his hands since that time. Never knew Walter Irving and Co. Never knew anything of them in business before February, 1855, when he had the bills containing their signature. He had spoken to Bruck about them in December, 1854.
Mr. RoY.-How came the name of Irving and Co. on the the Bankrupt.-Bruck said he knew their business *nd would bring It to bear. This referred to general commission business which he attended to. Bruck said he would bring them in contact as far as business was concerned. 'There were to be shipments. There is a firm of KIing and Co., of New York. Bruck said he was going to Bordeaux to see this house of Walter Irving and Co. established. This was in December, l.54. He said Irving was an American,-a native of Cincinnati
The CoMMssoNxs-I understood you to say that Walter Irving and Co.'s was a respectable house in Bordeaux?
Examination continued.-He knew King and Co., and understood there was to be no connexion between them and Irving and Co., but thought that Charles King was to act independently of them. Had known Holland ever since he (bhapt) was a discounter of bills-since 1852. Holland was a partner in the firm of Davis and Co., in the tobacco trade. When Holland started in the tobacco trade as Holland and Co. he wanted to have shipments from the United States, and he (bankrupt) said he could influence such consignments, and he was to have a commission upon them. To pay for these consignments Holland wante the money vhich the bills produced. He(bankrupt) introduced Bruck to Holland, and Bruck introduced Beckhart. He (bankrupt) knew Beckhart, and had written frequently to him. Had not a copy of any of those letters. He did not ask Beckhart to put L's name to these bils. Holland asked him. Bruck paid Beckhart a commission for putting his name to the bills. He introduced both Bruck and Beckhart to Holland.
Mr. RoY.-Did you and Bruck meet before any of the bills were drawn?
The Bankrupt.-Yes.
Mr. Roy.-And you have no correspondence to show between you and Bruck ?
The Bankrupt.-Yes. I can show you some letters. Mr. RoM.-Produce them.
The bankrupt said the letters were not of a recent date, and he had not them in his possession at the present moment.
Mr. ROY.-Who suggested that these bills should be drawn 'when Holand said he wanted money?
The Bankrupt.-Holland asked Bruckif he could dispose of draughts on Van der Heyde and Christian-no, it was only on Christian. This was in December, 1854. Holland said Bruck was to bring them in contact with Irving and Co. This was for the purpose of general business, not for bills, Bruck is a Dutchman. He (bankrupt) received the money and paid it- that was all. This conversation took place at Holland's oce. He (bankrupt) took Bruck there. Bruck was established in Paria before, but was in London then.
MIr. ROY.-Did Bruck go back to Paris to ouen an office? The Bankrupt.-Yes. No. I think he had one there; he had one after. The bills began flowing in in February 1855. He took Bruck to Holland because Holland wished to extend his business in the United States. Bruck said he had a counexion from the house of Irving and Co., and he wished to cultivate some business with him. Could not explain the nature of the transactions that Brack wanted with Holland. He introduced all the parties, and Holland was to get tobacco, through Bruck, from Irving and Co. Knew this because mention was made of a particular kind of tobacco. Holand was to get somne shipments from that quarter. Would not swear that at this meeting nothing was said about bills; he thought not in his presence; but he dare say bills were mentioned, but not in his presence.
M Yr. Ro.-What did you mean by "dare say" they were mentioned.
The Bankrupt.-He did not think they were mentioned in his presence. He just went in and out during the interview-that 'was all. Just said that Mr. Bruck was Mr. Bruck of Panrs whom he knew, the purport of the visit, and that Bruck was anxious to do business. Had several Interviews with Bruck wvhen Bruck was in London. Holland and Bruck said they had made some arrangement, and if he would act between them he could do so. At that time nothing was said about biUs.
Mr. Rom.-You have just said there was. Your memory is not very accurate.
The Bankrupt.-HoDand said if he could influence shipments he could give the names of different parties whom Walter Irving and Co. could draw UDon in London. Mr. ROY.-Were names mentioned .
The Bankrupt.-Holland only mentioned the name of Christian. He (the bankrupt) mentioned the name of Barclay. About half-a-dozen interviews took place between himself, Holland, and Beckhart. He realy did not think that any discussion took place between them about these
Mr. RoY here put a few questions to the bankrupt 'which caused him to manifest great indignation, and to say with great warmth that he was ready to produce Beckhart.
After some altercation, during 'which Ir. Roy said that the virtuousindignation of Mr. De Jonge 'would not prevent him from pressing the inquiry,
The bankrupt said he had kept no record of the biUs which he had not himself endorsed. The amount bearing his endorsement was 20,0001. Could not say the amount of the other bills. The bills referred to included the names of Von der Heyde, Christian, and Barclay; 10 or 12 biUs a-month had passed through his hands. Those upon Von der Heyde amounted to about 10,0C0I., but he thought not to 10,000h a-month. Von der Heyde was the largest acceptor. Beckhart 'was now in prison at Paris. Some creditors had been so kind as to put him there, although he was more than 70 years of age. Had not received a letter from him since April, 1854. Yes; he had a letter from him a month ago, asking some assistance. Could produce that letter. He (bankrupt) acted as Holland's agent in the matter, and he was to have a cornmisson as his broker. He was, however, out of pocket by the bils. Holland had been paid 25,0001.
be (Holland) had told him that this amount had bee thus apportioned:-Von der Heyde had had 5 0001; Christian, 2,000.; Mr. Yearsley, a merchant of iiverpool, whom Mr. Roy was very anxious to favour, 3.0001. M hr. Mason, tobacco manufacturer, Westminster, 3,000.; Mr. Bear, tobacconist, Bethnal.green, about 1,5001; * balance in the hands of Messrsm Kemp, bill brokers, 2,0001.; William Coley, 5004; Mr. Benjamin, Finsbury-pavement, 5004; anda lot of ther eople hadhad 4,0004o r5,0001. Didnot know the name o one of "the lot of people." Had thi
information from Holland. There were, he understood, a great many small manufacturers who had participated in the amiount. Holland had the proceeds of the'whole of the bills. Holland had not received value for the above sums as advanced by him to other parties.
The COM MsOiNP..-You have told us that Holland said money was 'wanted to pay for the consignments.
The Bankrupt.aYes ; and he disposed of consignmentsto patie'h hanoye paid for them. So far as he (bankrupt) knew, Holland had disbursed the money as he
sha te. Had never made a division with Holland yet. He ha not ot a ent-ot a penny of the proceeds. He did not 'want money. (A laugh.P) pred.H
IUr. Row.-If not, 'what has brought you here ?
On the1tfJnuary, 18545, he nha^d Csunffic°ien Cifor all purposes. If HoUand would py him only 50 per cent. of what
e owed him he was perfectly solvent
3Mr. RoY here askedfor an adjournment. It was altogether Incredibla that a man of the world like De Jonge could haxe acted as he would have it believed.
The bankrupt, examined by Mr. LUCAS, said, he had a surplus of 2,8001. only very recently, and but for Holland, 'who was his debtor to the amount of 13,0001., he wouldno
be perfectly solvent. The circumstance of Holland not being able either to speak any foreign language or esad foreign correspondence had caused hin to act as his agent.
Mr. Rlow said that the bankrupt had not received his commission.
The COarSS}ONiXB.-...H states that he has a claim upon Holland for the commission, and the reason he gives for doing all this for him was that he expected from Holland a commission. (To the bankrupt).-Did you, when you got the nine bils discounted, debit Holland with the discount?
The Bankrupt.-Yes.
Mr. Edwards, the official assignee, said he could find no trace of this debit in the books.
The bankrupt said it was entered under the head of "trade MIr. Edwards.-I cannot trace it.
In reply to a question, the bankrupt said he had influenced consignments to Holland, upon 'which he was entitled to a commission as well as upon the bills. He could produce an entry of this charge for commission; here was one
Mr. ROY.-So of all these large transactions you havo only one entry for the commission?
Th bankrupt mentioned other things to the amount of 6004 ; but 'what 'was the use of entering them in the books?
Examination continued.-Holimd was to accept the bils drawn upon Barclay.
Mr. ROY submnitted that the matter must be cleared up. Mr. Commissioner Fonblan~ro had refused to adjudicate upon Messrs Von der Heyde s certificate until this was done. Others of the parties 'were irn a similar position before other commissioners, 'who 'would not at present pass their examinations. De Joage was a principal in the singular trans. actions, and he must for the present stand adjourned.
The CoUmsx,essoiE suggested that a respectable account. ant should 7-a employed by the assignees of all the various estates jointly. It miight thus be practicable to trace the 'bill and their proceeds.
Mr. Row concurred. Messrs. Hardigaand Pulleminwere then appointed to inspect thehbooks of thesiX firms, and an adjournment of aix 'weeks was ordered.

tent of about 500. by having actuaUy paid his accommodation cceptances in Holland's favour to that amount. His debts are only315 and it was the accommodation acceptances that had occasioned his appearance in this court. This was the examination meeting.
Mr. Chidley appeared for the banlaupt; Mr. Abrahams for the assignees; and Mr. Michael for a creditor.
His HONOUR said this was a case quite distinct from others that had been referred to; it might, however, be desirable that the bankrupt should make some amendments in his balance-sheet, and there would be anadjournment for a fortnight for that purpoee.

Police.
POLICE,
WESTmLNSTg-Robert Kay Butler, a well-dressed and respectablelooking man, appeared to his recognizances to undergo a final examination, charged with a series of offences.
Mr. Bod}in appeared as before on behalf of Mr. Ioxdale, proprietor and prnter of a local paper caUed the West Mic?-i dlcse .iAdvrertcr.
The cirCumstances which gave rise tothe present proceedings are briefly these :-On the frstpublication of tle paper in question, early in November last, the prisoner offered his services to obtain advertisements, and was to receivo 20per cent, upon aU the money ho brought in. Shortly after this, and at a timewhen his commission onlyamounted toI.. los., he obtained a check from Mr. Boxdale for 10. onaccount. It was subsequently ascertained that.he had not onlI brought a numberof shamadvertisements, but, inhis capacity of collector, had embezzled divers sums received for the insertion of genuine advertisements.
wr Bodkin was rnot disposed to occupy the time of the Court with resoect to the false advertisements, which, he declared, prisoner had never had any authority to insert, and which had been produced to colour his claim for commission; but determined to shape the charges into fivo cases of embezzlement, and one of obtaining the IOI, above alluded to, under false pretences.
Five tradesmen were then examined, who proved that [ they had paid the prisoner divers smaUl sum amounting in
Mr. and Mrs oxdale tated that the whole money asconnted for by the prisoner was 3. 18B., having reference to other advertisers, aud 11. lQs. for which he never gave a list. He had never accounted for the mioney received from any of the five tradesmen above mentioned, and two of them had sent their advertisements to the offlco without any solicitation from or knowledge of the prisoner.
The accused declared that the 30s. paid to Mmrs Loxdale without any names was from those very individuals, as would be seen by the dates of the receipts. His solicitor, who was unable to attond, had possession of his papers, whereby it could be shown that he had committed no fraud, as the balance of his commission amounted to more than the money he had received.
The second charge against the prisoner was, that at the time of entering upon his engagement wit hIr. Loxdale he had represented that he was sole coUector or agent for lr. Smith, the great railway advertiser and contractor, and that when he asked Mr. Loxdale for the 101. he stated that the Messrs. Smith owed him several hundred pounds, which he could not get till after Christmas. Mr. Loxdale declared that it was an the faith of this representation alene that he gave prisoner the check for 10W.
Mr. Francis Moore, from the firm of Messrs. Smith and Son, Strand, said that it was not true that they owed the accused any money for coUecting advertisements. They were never in debt to coUectors, as they invariably paid them their commission six months in advance. There would be nothing owing to the defendant, according to that regulation, until next May, when his account would be 1, I6s 8d, still in advance, and contingent upon the advertisementsbeingcontinued. Hewas not their sole collector, and had received check in November for his six months in advance.
The accused said it was not true that he had ever represented to Mr. Loxdale that the Messrs. Smith owed him several hundred pounds. The check for 101 had been given him on account of commission, irrespective of any representation about the Messrs. Smith, and, deducting the amount of that check, he was stil entitled, as he had said before, to 81. more from Mr. Loxdale.
Mr. PAYSTER considered it his duty to send the above charges for trial at the Central Criminal Court, with a view to their full investigation by a competent tribunal, and took small bail for the prisoner's appearance there
WORsn-s}TREEr.-James Martin, a carpenter, was charged before Mr. D'Y-COrT with cruelty to his wife.
Bristow, N 59, said,-At 2 this morning, while on daty in Hoxton, I heard the sobs of a woman in Founder's-plae, and on going a little further found the prisoner's wife cry. mng, with a little child, which was almost naked, in her arms, and six other children in grief clinging to her. She said her husband had turned them aU out, and on my asking why he had done so he invited me in. Irefused, and as the woman and children came trembling up he exclaimed to his wife, with an oath, that he "would give it to her," and dealt a kick at her with all his force. The woman did not cry out, but I seized him, saying I could not see him commit such violence as that, and he instantly exclaimed " I'll do for you," and struck her with his fist in the face. The blow, inmy opinion, was struck as hard as he could hit her for she reeled staggering against the wall of the paseage, and when I saw her face full half an hour afterwards it was very badly swollen. The man was somewhat the worse for drink, while the woman was perfectly sober and, as she refused to charge him, I took him to the Robert-street station and charged him myself.
Mr. D'EYvxcoumv.-I fmd that balf the outrages upon women brought here arise from drunkenness. What doyou say to the charge ?
Prisoner.-Wy, I don't recoUect much about it. I have not had any work since Christmas.
Mr. D'EVBcCORT.-And yet you can find money enough to get intoxicated, and while in that state iMtreat your wife and turn her and the whole of your children into the utreet at 2 in the morning. This is really too gross; you will go for two months' hard labour in the House of Correction, where, in spite of your inclination to the contrary, you wilt be kept sober, and when you come out of prison do remember the ties that bind you, and try and keep sober still, in consideration ofyourwife and her helpless children. (To the officer of the district.)-You wvll see if a little assistance is not wanted by his family during the mauns imprisonmaent.
CrsRxmvsL.-,An il-looking boy, who gave the name of Charles Loder, aged 16, but who has frequently been in " trouble " under other alleses, was placed at the bar before MIr. COnRir, charged with breaking and entering the work. shop of Mr. John Sanders, a shoemaker, carrying on business at No. 37, Manchester-street, Gray's-inn-road, and stealing therefrom one pair of boots, and also with assault. ing Hlenry BAliday with a shoemaker's last.
It appeared from the evidence that last evening the comtinant Hlhday, who is employed in the next shop to Mr.
ders, saw the prisoner in the latter shop, and perceiving the window open he shut it down, and ept him in. He then sent for assistance, but before that arrived the prisoner Jumped out of the window and struck Haliday a violent blow in the face with a shoemaker's last, and attempted to make his escape, but before he conld do so Broadway, 303 A, came up and took the prisoner into custody. The prisoner had effected an entrance by breaking a pane of glass and opening the window. When the placewas searched a bag was found there. The pisoner has been several times convicted from this court, nd when taken into custody he gave a false address.
The prisoner, when called upon for his defence, said he was innocent. Although he was seen with the boots in his possession, he did not intend to steal them.
Mr. CORRIX said that he must get a jury to believe that story, and he should thbefore commit him for trial.
SauTiw.&s.-John Bradley, a middle-aged man, was brought before Mr. Coamr, charged with working an ilDcit still at No. 12, Mintstreet, Eouthwark.
Frederick Pargeter, an officer of the Inland Revenue, said that, from information he had received, he, in company of Messrs. Bullen Leigh, and other officers of the Excise, went about 1 o'Wlock that afternoon to No. 12, Mintstreet. Witness saw the prisoner in the shop, and told him he thonght something was going on wrong in the house He replied, " There is nothing going on wronP here." Witness told him he was an offcer of the Excise, and he went downstairs to the back kitchen, where he found a stil
set in brickwork, with a fire under it in full work, with spirits running from it. There were about three gallons of manufactured spirits, and everything necessary to carry on an extensive illicit distilery. Witness told the
risonerofit, when he said he was only making a little rop of gin, and he thought there was no harm in that. He aso said he was employed by a person named Jackson to do it for ll. a-week. Witness gave him into custody, and on searching the house he found three gallons of spirits upstairs.
Mr. CoiNr fined the prisoner 301., and, in default of payment, he was committed for three months.
LANmETHr.-Richard Moss, who was described as a blacksmith, but on whose person was found a " betting-. book," containing several entries of bets at long oddson the Derby and other forthcoming races, was charged before Mr. EraaoTr with being concerned with his wife in the commisson of two robberies.
Mr. John James Wells, a cornehandler residing at 17, Palace New-road, deposed that the prisoner's wife had been in his service as cook on the 1st of last month, and on that day absconded, taking with her three valuable shawls, 16 yardsofsalk, and otherproperty. On the same moring the prisoner, as he (ar.Weuls) should be able to prove, was seen loitering about the house, and one person heard him say he was " tired of waiting." He gave information of the robbery to the police, but nothing was heard of the prisoner until the present time.
Mrs. Jane Weaver, the wife of a blacksmith residing at 3, Great Suffolk-street, Borough, said she knew the prisoner from his having worked in the country with her husband, and also knew bis wife. On the 22d of October last the latter camne to her house and said her husband was working in Birmingham, and that, knowing that she (witness) had soe friendsthere, she caled to ask for a letter to them. She
Vent av ay, howeve,xtou tn for an ltter' ad immediately afterwards she (witness) missed her gold watch,
which had been safe and hanging up a few minutes before.
The pisoner denied all knoUledge of either robbery. and said he had no; seen his wife for a length of time.
Mrs. Weaver said she should bring proof on a future day that the prisoner and his wife were together on Boxing-day last.
This was denied by the prisoner, and, at the request oF the officers engaged in the case, the prisoner was remanded
to a future day.
the magitrte requested the acknowledgment of 101. from Mr. Pugh; 51., by Messrs. Coutts and Co., from "F.L. P.;" and 10s. in postage-stamps, from "B.," for the poor-box.

Testamentary Jurisdiction.
IPESTA.1EEITARY JMRISDICNION.
.f.meeting ot the L-aw Amendienit Society was held on 'Monday night to receive a report from the commuittee appointed to consider the Testamentary Bills of Last session and Sir F. Kelly's letter to Lord Brougham, which we published some weeks back. There was a large attendanice of members, and Mr. Pitt Taylor read the report:
He said that Sir R. Bethell, as represeating the Government, Sir F. Kelly, as representing the OPPosition, and Mr. Collier. as represeuitinir the independent members of Parliament, had all arrived at the conclosiorn that no effectua6l scheme of law reform, as applicable to wlls and intestacies, could be carried out except by depriving the EcclesiasticalCourts of all4urisdiction in matters testainentary, by ignoring the doctrine of bona notafdUia, and by 'b-reaking down the mnonopoly of the doctors and proctors. The committeeap proved of these cardinal amendments of the law. Thtey advanced no arguments in support of them, because no attempt had been maade to question their policy, and they considered it idle to parade proofs where judgment had virtually been allowed to go by default.
But the first poinLt on -which the promoeWrs of the several hills- of last session differed wias as to the nature andl the functions of the tribunal or tribunals to be henceforth intruisted with testamentary jurisdiction. They all agreedI that any Court on which testamentar-y jurisdiction was to be conferred should deal with wills of real as well as of personal estate. They all, too, recommended, though they differed in the details, that in certain cases probates and letters of administration should be granted by local tribunals. Moreover, the Attorney-General and Sir Fitzroy Kelly thiought that the court of probate should construe the terms of all wills, adudicate upon the rights of legatees, and administer the estates of deceased persons. On other matters far less unanim'ity prevailed. The Attorney-General seemed anxious that anew Qaeen's court should be established,which should virtually be anadditional department of the Court of Chancery, and that a single judge should preside in this court, who would differ in little but the name from a Vice-Chancellor, who would deal with facts as well as law without the intervention of a jury, and who would rely either on affidavits or on testimony reduced to writing behind his- hack by the examiner. Sir F. Kelly, while recormmending~ the establishment of a6 new court and the
appontent of a single judge, proposed that this court shudbe a court of common law, examining witnesses vivSa voce, calling in the aid of juiries when necessary, and adopt. ing pleadings andl procedure which should vie inamlicity with the forms used in the CoutCors Mr C rne contended that no new court sholbestlihd but that the testamnentary jurisdliction sholbetasred according to the amnount of the propery to be dealt with either to the courts. of comuion lawv or t the County Courts.
The committee were not satisfied with any of these schemes. They thought Sir Richard Bethell, in introducing into his court the system of procedure which prevails in couts of equity, had committed a fatal error. N~o doubt, that systein ha been im roved by recent legislation; but stil many of the rules o practice in Chancery, and especially, those which related to pleadings and evidlence, wvere 'highlly defective, and the mode of examiining wvitnesses was neary as faulty as any that could be devised. These objections were sufficiently weighty to foster and to justify the continuting unpopularity of the Court of Chancery, and they fumnishedE an uLnanswerable argument against any scheme for extending its jurisdliction. TIhey had, too, peculiar force when applied to testamentary causes, which generally turn on questions of sanity, undue influence, or f'raud, and require, beyond all other suits, to be dealt with by judges and juirors who have ample opportunity of watching the demeanour of witnesses. The committee objected to so much of Mr. Collier'sp lan a related to the courts of common law, They thought it vsVry undesirable to imipose o the 15 judges the duty of mnastering a branch of the
lw with some portions of which they are almost necessarily unifamilia. They referred to that large and troublesome class of suits which turn on the doctrines applicable to the different grants of limited admuinistration and the like. These doctrines ace not very abstruse, andl able lawyers mnight, itfuecessary, soon maake themselves acqluainted with their details; but the judges, who have passed the meridian of life,' would probably not regard with mnuch favour any schemne which wouald necessitate a departure from the beaten track of their ordinary duties, and convert themi from administrators of the lawv into hearers of the law. Mr. Collier's plan was exposed to two other objections. First, the Chancery Commissioners of 18.54 had pointed out that " uniformity of practice is of essntial importance in regard, to the probate of wills ;" and this uniformity would not be promoted by the transfer of the btisiness to three independlent courts of concurrent jurisdiction. 2Next, the coniinittee foreaw ffeat dlifficulty in framing any machinery for duly controlling the registrars einployed in conducting the common form business, when once they were subjected to the interference of three so arate tribunals.
"No man can serve two masters, anT the coulmittee would not recommend that the registrars of wills should be called upon to serve three.
Sir F. Kelly', in proposing the est-ablishment of a separate court, had an obvious advantage over AMr. Collier, and, by insistinir that his court sliouldbe a couirt of comimon law, he placed in strong relief the prinicipal defect of the Attoniey- General's mneasure. Thus far, thien, his schieme was excellent ; but it was open to c-ertain objections. First, 'his court was to consist of a single judge, whio should enjioy the rank and receive the salary of a puisne judge. This arrangement was faulty. It was objectionable to increase the number of our common law judges. It was not always an easy mnatter to find 1a5nmen of sufficient professional eminence to discharge the functions of a judge in a really crditable mnannier, and it wouldl he inexpedient to aggravate this difficulty, unless a case of necessity were made out. But Sir Fitzroy had iiot established any such case. A strong impression, too, prevailed in the country that the common lawv judges had not sufficient employiment to occupy their timne, and a commnission had been appointed to report on the expedlineny of dimninishinig their numbers. In the face of these facts the Hlouse of Comimons would not be very willing to sanction the appointment of a sixteenth judge. Such a course was quite unnecessary. Iustead of appointing a new judge fur the court of probate, tbree of the existing puisne judges shiould constitute that court, one to be selected fromi the Court of Queen's Bench, another from the Court of Commion Pleas, and the thiird from the Court of Exchequer, These judges would still continuie to be miemibers of their original courts, and when not sitting as a court of probate would transact busimiess as ordinary common law judges. They would be appointed without additional salary, and when engaged in the court of probate the remaining judge wudrnak-e arrangements for dia using wvith their attendance in their respective courts. isplanipresented several advantaces. 1. It wsould save thesalaries of ajudge, secretary, uslier, and trainbearer, which could not be less than 5,6001. a-year, aLnd this mnatter deserved attention, as the measure must cost the counitry dear in the shape of comipensations, 2. The substitution nf three judges for one would add to the authority of the Court, and would assimilate tits proceedings to those of the other courts of common law, It would also remove an anomaly ; for, as all issues of fact in country causes arising out of disputed wvills were to be senit for trial to the assizes, if the court of probate were to consist of one judge alone he would on every application for a new trial he requiired to review the coniduct of other judges of co-ordina-te or superior authority. 3. The plan would i seonthe conmmnon law judges sonie additional labour, an th8o0usemd to remnove all cauise for public dissatisfaction on 'the ground of the judicial staff being disproportionately large. No alarm need be felt lest by this arrangemient the energies of the juidges should be overtaxed; for, as a large portion of judicial business is during term tr-ansacted in banco, the principal effect of employing one judge of each court in the disposal of t-estamentary causes would be to introduce the practice of three judges sitting togethier, instead of four,a practice which,althoughit wouldincresse the responsibility, couild add little to the labours of each judge, and would not imypair the efficieilcy of the Court. 4. The plan pro posed
wuld neutralize an objection that has been urged in hiighi quiarters to tIme establTishment of a new court of probate. The Lord Chancellor, in 18.54, stated, on the authiority of the Chancery Commissioners, that the Ecclesiastical Courts were not occupied more than 60 days annuially in contentious business relating to wills; and he then asked with numull force, "how it Could possibly he advisable to crreate a new tribunal, which woiild have no employment whatever during 10 months in the year." -Now, by " creating a new tribunal," Lord Cranworth evidently ineant
.1appointing a niev judge," and in this lighit his reasoning -was unanswerable ; but if the couirt were to consist, not of a new judge exclusively occupica in testamnentary uiatters, but of three judg-es draughted fromn other courts, who, when thecout o prbat had no business to transact, would be empoye inther rdinary avocations, tIme whole arguiment crumbls to ieces A fifthi cogent reason for Vrefers-fog the lanadvoate bythe committee to that of Sir Fitzroy Kely ws t befond in the same debate -to which alhmalon had jst ben mde. inmy opinion," said Lord Cs-anworth, a minue diviiono labour in the higher depatet of juirispdec is highly inexpedient. I do nobeiv that amawh never considers any other subject will be as competent to determine a q~uesion of insanity, or of undue influence, as one who is in the habit of deaing with such subjects in commion w-ith other questions to which his judicial capacity is applied ; and so far froni considering it to he an advantage that only a single class of cases shouald be submitted to each judge, I regard it in -the light of a serious disiadvantage. "
The plan of appointing sonie of thie existing judgies -to sit as a separate tribuanal and to deal with a particular class of cases was not a niew idea. It h~ad in,,
formieu a fundamnental part of the Scottish system of judicature, and it had been successfully adopted in England under the provicions of the statute 3d and 4th William IV., calp. 4t1, in seletinug the nenibers of the Judicial Coinsnittee of the Privy Cosudiil. Nay, the eanic principle was recognized to souse extent in our tles-c superior courts of comnimo law; for, although in most legal matters the 15 judges -exercis cn uret powers amid( perforin simnilar fCnotions, yet certain exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Court of I~aeemm's Bench with s-e p set to crimies anid parochial law, in the Court of C tcnmon PEleas with respect to the law oQf Parliamentary electiecs, and in the Court of Exchequer with respeot do revenue evaues,
The plan gz-oposed wou:d probably not be opposed by the Judges, as it would affeit only three of tbem; and if some slight honcrary nistinction, in the shape of precedence or the like, were o,uferred on the members of the court of probate, the rables's of the puice-e judges would gladly oorn,sent to qualify t.liemnsplves for the office.
The second objecti, urged bf the committee to Sir * itzroy iKelly's scheme kes referenee to the proposal, which he made in common witbL Sir Riebard Bethell, that the new court of probate should .lso be x court of construction and a court of administratit.u, Nearly one-half of the business transacted by the Ei:aity Judges has relation to testamentary causes. Either the terms of a will have to be construed, or the rights of a legat.,e have to be defined, or the estate of a testator has to be ao.muinistered. All these suits are, of course, conducted in accordance with the forms of equity procedure. Sir Fitzro.; does not intend to depxive the Court of Chancery *;f any portion of this Jmmrisdiction, but he wishes to confer on his court-which
g t be a common law court, employing con,mon law
--^j4;p-a similar jurisdiction. Thus, there woi.2d be prs- - dn4opt tribuuals of co-ordinate power, so far as two ISOt, ",A of wills and the administration of the the construta.- -xive c
effets o decss.d wer concerned, and eacha would
deal with the matters before it in a mode essentially different from that which was adopted by the other. No arrangement could be more unatisfactory. The new Court would do its work either better or worse than tho Court of Chancery, or there would bo no perceptible differ! ence between the two. If the work were done worse, the
; pubhc would sustain a positive loss by the change- if the
done equally well, the only effect would bo that salaried functionaries would despatch business /hich four can now, despatch with ease; anid if the work were done better the court of probate would ba thronged and the Court of Chancery deserted, and the whole of our judicial machinery, so far as the courts of equity are concerned, would be thrown out of ger.
This objection did not extend to Sir R. Bethell's scheme; for, as in his court suits would be carried on through the medium of the usual formns of proceeding in equity, there would be no inconsistency in imposing op. the judge of that court several of the duties which now devolve on the ordinary Vice-Chancellors. The scheme, however, had other weak points, in common with that which Sir F. Kelly advocated. Thus, both were open to the objection that, as the present staff of equity judges was amply sufficient to keep down all arrears in their courts, and as they now disposed of all questions of construction and suits for administration, it would be impossible to clothe another court with jurisdiction over these matters without diminishin- the business, and thus impairing the efficiency of the existing tribunals. MNloreover, the committee doubted the expediency of conferring on any one superior court the separate powers of granting probates, const-ring wills, and administering estates, on the ground that the union of these separate functions in one court would afford a dangerous facility for needless litigation. The advice given by lawyers to their clents is not always disinterested, and it is notorious that much less persuasion is required to induce a man who is already involved in law to take ulterior steps in the cause than to commence legal proceedings de nowio. If the court of probate were made a court of construction, so that an attorney might suggest to an executor that it would be prudent, on obtaining probate, to take the opinion of the court on some doubtful expression in the will, many frivolous questions respecting alleged obscurities would, for the mere sake of costs, be submitted to judicial decision, whicb, under other circumstances, would never have been seriously raised.
Sir P. Kelly's scheme was radically defective in ano'ther point. In common with the Attorney-General and Mr. Colier he recognizes the necessity of conferring on certain district offices or courts a limited testamentary jurisdiction. But in selecting the districis he had coummitted a twofold error. First, he had proposed the establisbment of only 32 offices,-a number absurdly insufficient, as the country contained 52 counties, and was divided into 60 County Coturt districts; and next, he had been induced, apparently through the influence of the local proctors and registrars, to adopt substantially the present diocesan districts, and thus to fix his offices in most inconvenient localities. For instance, no office was vouchsafed to Liverpool, the second city in the kingdom, but every probate required by any one of her 255,000 inhabitants must be obtained either at Chester or in London. Again, the West Riding of Yorkshire, containing a population not far short of a million and a-half, had no court of probate nearer than York; and the whole of the county of Derby was left dependent on the town of Nottingham. The people of Plymouth must travel more than 60 miles to Exeter, the men of Birmingham and Wolverhampton must go to Lichfield; and the inland town of Winchester must furnish probates and letters of administration for the 150,000 persons who resided in Southampton, Portsmouth, and the Isle of Wight. Ar. Coler had originated a far wiser plan, which was, that the only tribunals to be intrusted with local testamentary jurisdiction should be the County Courts. New local courts should not be created to administer so small aSsubdivision of the law as that which relates to wills and intestacies. The more courts are multiplied the less chance there is of securing anything like uniformity in decisions or procedure. The creation, too, of a court is always an expensive affair, as it entails not only the appointment of a judge and a competent staff of officers, but the purchase or renting of a court-house, with an appropriate registry. Moreover, when two functionaries in separate offices are partially engaged in transacting business which might be psed of by one of them in a single office, each is unlikely to attain that efficiency which is the result of experience and practice. The work, in short, will hbe less wer done, and the cost of doing it wil be far
On every ground it was desirable to intrust the County courts with whatever testamentary business it might be thought desirable to have transacted in the country. The courts themselves were most conveniently situated for the despatch of local business. All the larger ones had good offices, and, wvhat was of great importance when wills had to be registered, they possessed fireproof rooms for the protection of their records. The registrars had been selected in consequence of their known intelligence and integrity, and where the business of the courts was at all extensive they must be competent to perform the additional duties which would devolve upon them by the plan pro. posed. No doubt, a little study and attention would be necessary at first, and some slight awkwardness might be felt at starting; but a very few weeks would render the officers familiar with the routine, and, practically speaking, the system would work without any difficulty.
The committee next proposed that the registrarsof the County Courts should act as district officers of the metropolitan court with respect to all " common form" or non. contentious business, where the estate of the deceased amaounted to 3001. They should entertain applications for probates or administrations, give directions respecting the production of documents and proofs and the preparation of affidavits, see that these directions were complied with, and transmit the apersto the court in London, in order thatthey might be fin y examined by one of the principal registrars. The actual probate or administration ,sould be granted by the metropolitan court, and the documents, when duly completed, should be returned to the local registrar, to be by him delivered to the proper parties. This arrangement would be productive of much benefit to the public, for it would enable executors and administrators to transact their business without the aid of an attorney, and would obviate the necessity of employing a London agent.
The duties of the County Court registrars ought to be restricted in the manner stated above-partly because this course would best insure uniformity of practice, partly because errors would be more likely to be discovered when documents were subjected to a twofold examination; and partly because the seal of the metropolitan court would
far better known than that of any County Court, and consequently any attempt to utter a forged probate would be more easily detected.
Next, when the property of a deceased person is sworn under 3001. the County Court of the district in which he dwelt at the time of his death should be authorized to grant probate or administration, wbether in a contentious or a non-contentious suit, and in all these cases the registrar should transact the common form business, subject to the control of the judge in cases of diffilculty.
From a return published by the Chancery Commissioners in 1854 it appears that exclusive of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury and the courts of the Archbishop of York, the annual grants of probates and administrations, where the property was sworn under 3001., amounted on an average of the three years 1850, 1851, and 1852, to S,947,-a number sfficiently large to illustrate the value of any measure which would facilitate, simplify, and cbeapen the proceedings required for obtaining these grants ; yet a number sufficiently small, when read in connexion with the annual returns of deaths, to prove how extensively the annoyance, trouble, and expense consequent on the present testamentary system operate in deterring the personal representatives of deceased p,ersons from perfecting their titles according to law.
The committee further recommended that in cases under 3001. the County Courts should exercise aU powers now vested in the Court of Chancery with reference to the interpretation of wills and the determination of the rights of parties under them, and also with reference to the administration of the estates of deceased persons. The metropolitan court of probate should not be either a court of construction or a court of administration, because, under the existing law, the Court of Chancery interpreted wills and administered estates in a tolerably satisfactory muanner; hut we think that the Countv Courts should be clothed with these powers wvith respect to properties sworn under 300., because, under the existing law, there was practically no court which could deal with sucl matters, The Court of Chancery was only open to those who "put money in their purse," and no mnan of ordinary prudence would seek for the decision of a Vice-Chancellor, with a pOSSible appeal to the Lords Justices and the House of Lords, on a question involving less than S001. Moreover, such a course would afford no dangerous facility for pnomoting litigation; for the fees to which professional men are entitled in the County Courts were not sufficiently large to teempt them to advise unnecessary proceedings for thieazkte of costs.
The commuittee did not recommenid that all the 500 courts established in 1846 should exercise the powers of a court of probate. In many of these courts the business transacted was extremely email, and the registrars hadi scarcely sufficient official experience to justify their employ. ment in matters relating to wills and intestacies. Moreover, the court-houses and offices were inconvenient, and no proper fireproof registries ahad been provided for them. It was therefore proPosd that the experi. mient should be tried with about one-third of the courts, the Treasury being authorized to add to their numbers ortov err- ~ - socses i acodac with puli
convenionoe. Evates ,i accordance with public
convenience. Every court disposing of more than 1,000 plaints annually ought to be intrusted with testamentary ?urisdiction, and the last County Court returns showed that in 1855 107 courts were included in this category.
60 or 70 more courts might be judiciously selected for the experiment, regard being had to their accessibility with respectto neighbouring towns; and the districts of the re-
maining courts should, for testamentary purposes, be attached to the selected courts in such manner as might be
thought most desirable. The Coulnty Courts judges could on this subject furnish the best information, if the attention of each was directed to the requirements of his own immediate circuit.
The coznmittee declined to exprees their views on the subject of compensation, which would, no doubt, be dealt with by the House of Commons in a liberal, but not a lavish, spirit. They, however, drew attention to two enactments, witli which the public are probably not very fam-iliar, viz. :-the act of the 4th and 7ch of William IV., c. 77, s. 25, and 10th and 11th of Victo-ia, c. 98, s , 9 - and they pointed out that under these provisions no officer of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury can claim compensation if his appoirntment dates subsequently to the 22d of July,
1847; and the clairn to compensation is barred with respect to the officers of a other ecclesiastical courts unless they
have been appointed prir. to the 18th of Au st, 1836. In these cases no compensaon might be granted as a matter of favour, but it coul d not'demanded as a matter of right. I Mr.Taylor then move. that it would be expedient,-

WARRANTS.
TO THB EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Would you permit me to suggest a word or two in relation to the above important question ?
The principle of the law in this country decides that where there is forgery no title can pass, so that if the endorsement of a bill is forged the bill can be recovered; if the endorsement of a bill of lading is forged no titli to the goods passes, and the same principle would obtain in the case of warrants if the last endorsement proved not genuine; and this principle is so well recognized by the English law that in tvo cases, decided not along ago, a clerk having in the one endorsed a bill by procuration, and discounted it wvith an eminent merchant (having in reality no procuration), it was recovered by the said clerk's employer; while in the other it was decided that, even after a review of the signatures by a company, the payment of a banker for their account was bad, it having turned out that the signatures were not genuine.
In the matter of warrants, therefore, which are docu. ments of great importance to the commercial world, and made use of to cover advances to the amount of millions, would it not be a desirable settlement to make them valid in all cases, in the hands of innocent boncs .de holders (excepting the case of forgery), whatever the fraudulent circumstances may have been attaching to previous holders?
We cannot have two different principles of law prevailing in one and the same country, and I apprehend we cannot persuade the Legislature to change the principle which governs the case of forgery in all these instances.
If you would assist the mercantile body by your powerful advocacy to obtain a simple remedy for a great grievance, you would perform a great public good; but that remedy should be plain, simple, practicable, and, if possible, free from legal subtleties.
I am, Sir, respectfuly yours,

Customs' Duties On Passengers' Baggage.-
CuSToMs' DUTIES oN PASSENGERS' B.AGGAGE.-- SOUTHAMIPTON, Tuesday.-A regulation has recently been adopted at the East India and London Docks, which, it is hoped, for the advantage of persons travelling and the expedition of commercial arrangements, will very soon be introduced at this port. The Board of Customs have ordere a clerk to be stationed at the baggage-warehouse of the abovenamed docks, for the pur"oee of receiving on the spot the duty to which goods may be liable; and it is most Important that a similar order should be issued for this port, where probably the largest amount of foreign passenger traffic in the country is now carried on. The appointment of a clerk to receive these duties at the baggagewarehouse in the Southampton Docks would confer a great boon on passengers, by saving them time or expense, they having at present either to go to the Custom-house, which is at some distance from the baggage warehouse, and thus delay is involved, or to pay the duities through an agent, who, of course, charges for his labour, and thus an additional tax upon the passengers' pockets has to be submitted to. The inconvenience is even more severely felt here, from the fact of the passengers being strangers to the place altogether, while in London a large proportion of those who land from abroad find themselves at home. We understand that the Collector aud Controller of Customs at this port have recommended the appointment of a clerk at the baggage-warehouse here for the above purpose, and it is hoped that the Board will cause an order to bo issued to carry out so important a regulation.
A MADMANk ri TnE VATIcA.-ROmE, Jan. 15.- While sanguinary tragedies have saddened the inhabitants of Paris and Naples, eccentricities of a less homicidal characte. have amused the inhabitants of Rome, and especially the nocturnal pranksof a madman who recently gained access to the Vatican Palace, notwithstanding the scrutinizing glances of tho Swiss halberdiers stationed in the grand corridor leading to the eca& i-cgia. It appears that this unfortunately aberrated individual succeeded in secreting himself in the precincts of the palace unstil the night was far advanced, when he suddenly aroused and alarmed the inhabitants of the apostolic residence by vociferating ia stentorian tones that the Pope was dead, foRlowing up this startling piece of intelligence by another vague assertion, that he himself was about to succeed his Holiness on the Pontifical throne, and that, as first frutit of his authority, he shou.d order the Cardinal Secretary of State to be shot. It may bS easily imagined with what consternation these overwhelming announcements were received, until the illomened individual was laid hands upon, and the state of Mig intellects discoyered. The great gates of the Vatican have been closed at i;ghtfall civqe this untoward ccurrepece.-

LONDON, BPIGHTON, AND SOUTH COAST.
The report of the directors of this company states that the amount of capital raised to the 31st of December, 1856, was 7,759,415L, consisting of 1,906,135?. mortgage debt, 1,23$47261. preference capital, and 4,618,554. consolidated stock. The total outlay on capital account during the half-year has been 7,746., of which 4,791L bas been expended in the execution of works necessary to accommodate the increasing traffic, and the remainder has been applied towards the construction of an electric telegraph qn the Portsmouth and Hastings lines and minor branches. The extra number of miles now worked over, to which a further addition will be made when the West-end line is opened throughout, will render it necessary that the rollingstock should be augmented so as to meet these requirements, as well as those of the generally increasing traffic. The directors think it right to call attention to this subject, as, the available capital being only 7,5921., it will be necessary, at an early period, to ask the proprietors to sanction an application to Parliament for power to increase it, for, should the traffic continue to expand, it will not be poesible to conduct it with efficiency and economy unless adequate means are provided. The average rate of interest on the mortgage debt still remains at 4?. 2s, per cent. The gross revenue for the half-year has been 433,5721., showing an increase of 24,9661. over the corresponding half-year of 1855, and making a total increase of 57,229?. for the year 1S55, as compared with 1855. Upon examining the detailed accounts of traffic it is satisfactory to find that this increase is not confined to any particular locality, but is distributed generally over every portion of the company's system of lines. From the comparative table given in the report it appears the number of miles ran during the half-year was 963,
against 1,118,573 at the corresponding period of 1855and the total traffic receipts (excludirg cartage), amounted to 421,0791., against 396,980?. The total expenses (excluding cartage) amounted to 183,450L against 174,042?.; the cost of cartage amounted to 8,358., against 8,1171. at the corresponding perncd of 1855. The ordinary expenses for the half-year were 151,510., against 139 9651., and the renewals and additions 31,9401., against 34,077Z. The expenses per train mile were 3s. 94d., against 3s. lid., and the percentage of expenses on traffic receipts 43' against 434. A table exhibiting the progress of the traffic during the past nine years shows that the number of passengers conveyed on the line was 2,485,778 in 1848 and 6,811,904 in 1856, and the receipts 349,977?. and 540,787& respectively. The seasontickets had increased from 10,427?. to 33,1661., the parcels from 13,130?. to 17,655?., the goods from 61,443?. to 138,8511., and the rents, &c., from 5,5811. to 11,529?. The total receipts, exclusive of cartage, increased from 453,408? in 1848 to 758,7591. in 1856. The number of miles run was 1,119,30S in 1848, and 1,887,488 in 1856. The total expenditure in 1848 amounted to 187,087?., including 39,9551. for taxation, and in 1856 to 330,9421., including 48,1531. for taxation. The total working expenses in 184$ amounted to 147,1321., including 6,1611. for renewals and additions; and in 1856 to 282,7891., inclading 51,418? for renewals and additions. The preferential charges for mortgage debt and guaranteed capital amounted in 1848 to 104,041?., and in 1856 to 145,3771., and the dividend to from 31. 12s. per cent. to 6?. per cent. The dividend in 1849 was at the rate of 3?. 17s. per cent. ; in 1850, 41. 2s. per cent.; in 1841, 4?. 16s. percent.; ian 1852, 41 4s. per cent.; in 1853, 5 per cent.; in 1854,51. 10s. per cent.; in 185.5, 5 per cent. ; and in ISM, at the rate of 6 per cent. A considerable sum has been again expended in renewals of the permanent way, carriages, and waggons. The vehicles now constructed by the company are more costly than the old ones which they replace, inasmuch as they are of a superior and more durable quality, and capable of carrying a much larger number of passengers. Considerable additions and improvenents have also been made in the locomotive stock, to which five powerful engines have been added dtuing the past half-year. The length of the main line remaining to be relaid and fishjointed is 12 miles, the larger portion of which will be completed during the current year. The system adopted by the directors has resulted in placing the permanent way, buildings, and rolling stock in a most efficient end satisfactory condition, and tiley are also pleased to have it in their power to inform the proprietors that this efficient condition of the line and plaut, combined with the zeal, intelligence, and energy of their staff, has enabled them to carry on a largely increased traffic during the past year with perfect safety to the public, and without an accident. The directors have, subject to the sanction of the proprietors, entered into an agreement with the promoters of a line from Lewes to Uckfield, a distance of 74 miles, similar to that made with the East Grinstead Company, the rent in this case being 1,8801. per annum., or 4 per cent. apon a capital of 47,0001., this company securing the right of parchasing it at any time for that sum. The other scheme is for a line about 14,4 miles in length, from forsham to Petworth. The cost of constraction will be about 7,0001. per mile; and the directors have made a similar arrangement with its promoters, at 4 per cent. upon the estimated cost, with power to purchase it at any time upon like terms. The net amount at the credit of the revenue account is 166,050?., out of which the directors recommend the payment of a dividend of 3, per cent. for the half-year, amnounting to 161,649?., leaving a balance to the credit of the current half-year of 4,4011., and making the dividend for the yearl856 amountto6 percent. Therevenue accountforthe
alf.year shows that 433,7911. had been received,' and 191,8071. expended, including 12,0841. rates and taxes, and 13,588?. Government duty, leaving a balance of 241,9831., out of which 72,0231. is deducted for preference charges, 1,000?. for the benevolent fund, 1,0001. insurance fund, 1,0001. rent of East Grinstead line and 9101. for rent of Wimbledon and Croydon Railway, leaving 1C6,0491., as above, for ordinary dividend.
GRAND TRUNK OF CANADA.
The arrangements of this company for booking passengers from the principal ports in Europe to Canada and the leading cities of the Unaited States evenen completed. By means of those arrangements a passenger or emigrant is enabled to ascertain the actualexpenEe, before starting, of his passageby ship andrailway from Europe to his destination in I orth AmericaHe willthus notonly beprotected from the ex.- tortionofpersons onlanding, butwillbeunderthe careoftbe company's agents until conveyed to the end of his journey. It appears the company have agents at Liverpool, Eull, Aberdeen, Glasgow, Dublin, Belfast, Cork, Gaiway, Havre, Antwerp, Rotterdam, Brermen, and Hamnburg for booking passengers, the chief office being in London. From those pla passengers can be booked through vi Boston, Portland, or Quebec, to anyplace in Canada or the United States, havinga continuous railwaycommumication to it. Passengers can be conveyed either by the first, second, or third class to at least 96 railway stations in North America. The Grand Trunk consists of 858 miles of railway, wbich are open for traffic to Portland, Quebec, Montreal, Toronto, and Stratford; and the arrangements made by the company with railway companies in Canada and the United States enable them to book passengers of aU classes through to their destination at the lowest current rates of fare, and also to forward them with extra despatch. The several com'panies forming the route ran their regular trains in connexion with those of the Grand Trunk Company, and wiUl, when there are a suficient number of passengers to render it necessary, put on a special traini. Passengers holding through tickets will be enabled to proceed on their journey immediately after landing, either at Boston, Portland, or Quebec, and will have their luggage removed from the ship to the railway free of charge. They will thus avoid impositions and frauds being practised upon them by pretended agents for various routes, and have the advantage of receiving reliable information from the comipany's agents at the various places. The printed list of through-booking fares to the various places shows the amount in English and American money. It is believed that the arrangements just completed by the Grand Trunk of Canada Company wiU afford great facilities to enugrants and save them considerable expense. An emigrant or passenger can obtain from the agent at the ports mentioned, or the head-ofi;ce, a ticket in which will be included the passage money across the Atlantic, and the railway fare to his destination. One half of the ticket wiUl be given up to the captain or purser of the ship before he lands, and on ptresenting the other to the passenger and emigration a ent of the company at Boston, Portland, or Quebec, who wil be on the spot, it will be exchanged for a railway ticket which wiol ass him to his destination. An effective and simple plan Is adopted to enable the agents in the Canadian ports to know what passengers they may expect. The agent at either of the different European ports, on the sailing of the vessel in which he has booked passengers, advises the central office of the company in London of the names of the passengers who have through tickets, their class, and the destination of each person. These being registered in the London office the particulars are forwarded by the weekly steamer to the agent at the port for which the ship sails, so that he will have amnple time to prepare for their reception. On the arrival of the passengers refreshment rooms suited to the wants of each class are provided. The rate fhxed for the running of emigrant trains is 20 miles per hour, including stoppages of an hour for refreshment at the end of every 100 or 120 miles. The Canadian system of railways ceases at Detroit, 730 miles from Quebec, but on the arrival of the through passengers the company's emigration officer, who will have previously received intimation by telegraph of their destination, will provide accordingly for the continuation of their journey over lines in the United States, where other agents of the company will likewise attend to them, and so on until they arrive at the end of their journey. The fares are exceedingly lowa, and it is expected that the whole of thearrngeent, hic ar coducedon the responi b ythearrameGrand Thrucnhk Ctoemcpoandy, will give genera sats faction.

1UNCHESTER, JAN. 20,
There is little orno change in the market. For 40-inch shirtings, suitable to the markets of Indis and China, the demand is very limited, and prices, though nominally quoted as before, are in favour of the bayer. Forprinting cloths there is still a moderate demand, at foUl pnces, and some makes of longeloths and T-cloths are m reqnest at lhst quotations. The sales, however, on the whole have been inconsiderable, and had there been any accumulation of stocks worth naming prices would have given way more decidedly in India goods.
The reports of the yarn-market are also nnfavourable. For water twist few offers vtere made so as to test prices, and, though there was a fair inquiry for some kinds of mule twist, it did not lead to much business. For the latter kinds of yarn spinners were showing more firmness than lsut week, but some irregularity bas been observable, and sellers pressing on the market in some few cases have been willing to accept less money.
The circular of Messrs. John Slagg and Co. says,"There is no now feature in the market to-day. Long cloths, T-cloths, and printers continue in moderate demand, and prices are fimly maintained, but for nearly all other kinds, and especially for India and China goods, there is little or no demand, and, though there are not yet any accumulations of stock, prices are becoming very irregular. The offers made, however, are not of sufficiet magnitude fairly to test the market, and we resume our quotations of Tuesday last."
eNOTTINGHAM, JAx. 20.
Although there is not as yet much doing in the lace trade (the busy season not having set in), manufacturers are anticipating an exceUent spnng business. There are not so many black goods making just now. The home demand is dull, but there are some orders completing for both the United States and the continent.
In hosiery there is a good demand, and, the stocks on hand being light, this department of our staple trade is very buoyant.
LEICESTER, JAN. 20.
The hosiery trade is by no means active. The season has not, howtever, yet set in. Manufacturers have for along time past been unable to obtain properly remunerative pricesfortheirgoods, the rates of both wools and yarns bDeing exceedingly gh. Stocksare being reduced, mannfacturersjudginig it prudent not to increase them, in consequence of the dearness of materiaL.
LEEDS, Jan. 20.
There has been a steady demand for wooUen cloths and mixed fabrics this morning, and a good bulk has been sold, considering the quantity brought to masket. Goods to order are passing freely betweenx manufacturers and merchants, and the trade presents the same satisfactory aspect we have for some time had to report.
The Hluddersfield market has been brisk to-day, there being a good attendance of buyers, who purchased freely of piece-dyed blacks, as well as of fancies And low goods. Wools continue to present an up ward tendeucy in price.

At this day's market there was only a moderate attendance of town and country buyerr, who acted with great caution, and restricted their putrchases as muchi as poseiblo.

With a candour almost as uncommon as his accuracy, he never fails to notice any variation of consequence in the statements of the hostile party ; and either to refute it by argument, or fairly to balance it with the Opposing testlimony.
