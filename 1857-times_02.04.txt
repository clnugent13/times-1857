"We are comsaaided by BerMajesty to inform you that difficulties Which arose in rej3fd to some of the proilsionsof the treaty of Paris delayed the complete execution of the stipu;ations of that treaty.
" Those difficulties have been overcome in x satsfactory manner, and the intentions of the treaty have been fully maintained.
"IAn A insurrectionary movement which took plce in September last in the Swis Cahton of NTeuchiatel, for the purpose of re-establishing in that canton the authorlt; of the King' of Pruss as Prlnce of Neuch&tel, led to serious differences between His Pruss Majestyand the Swiss Confederation, threatening atone time to disturb thegenejl peace of Europe. But Her Maiesty commandsus to inform you that, in concert with her august ally the Emperor of the French, she Is endeavourlng to bring about an amicable settlement of the matters in dispute, and EIer MAjesty enter. fauins a confident e4etat fon that an honosirable and satis. factory arnment will be ooncluded.
"In consequence of certain discusdons which took place during the conferences at Paras, and: which are recoided in tho protocols tht were laid before you, Her Majewty and the Emperor of the Fench 'ansed communicatioins to be made to the Government of the Kiig of the Two Sicilies, for the purpose of inducing him to adopt a course of poly calculated to avert dangers which might disturb that peace which had so recently been rettored to Europe.
"Her Majest emmaids us to inform 'you that the manner in which those friendly communicationsWmere received by Eis Sicilian Mijesty ras such as to lead Her Majesty and the Emperor of the French to discdutinue their diplomatic relations with His SicDian Majesty, and they have accordingly withdrawn their missiona from- the Court of Naples.
"Her aesty has directed that papers reating to this subject shall be lid before you.
"Her Majesty commands usto inform you, that'she has been engaged in negotlations with the Government of the United States, and also with the Government of Honduras, which she trusts wil be sucessful in removing all ciuse of misnderstanding with respect to Central AMerica
" Her Majesty has concluded a- treaty -of frisndship and commerce with Siam, Which Will be laid before you.:
"Her Majesty commands us to express to y6n liet regret that the conduct'of the Persian Government has led to iostilities beti'eee ' H-edf-a5cty '-and tbe BShah 'of
"The Persian Government, in defiance of -repeated warn. iagS, and in violation of its engagements, has besieged and captured the important city of Herat.
"We are comnmaded by Her Majesty to inform you that a British naval Wad military force, despatched from Bombzy, IsastALken possession of the Isand of Rack and of the townof Bushire, with a view to induce the Shah to accede to the just demands of lIer Majesty's Government.
"Her Majesty has seen with matisfaction that the naval and military forces employed on this occasion have displayed their accustomed gallantry and spirit.
" Her Mfajesty commands us to inform you that acts of violence, insults to the British flag, and: infraction of treaty rights committed by the local Chinese authorities at Canton, and a pertinacious refusal of redress, have rendered it necessary for Her jesty's officers in China to have recourse to measures of force to obtain satisfaction.
"Those measures had, up tothe date of the last accounts, been taken with great forbearance, but with signal success as regards the conflicts to which they had led.
"We arecommanded to inform you that Her Majesty trusts that the Government of Pekin will see the propriety of affording the satisfaction demanded, and of faithfilly fulfilling its treaty engagements.
"Gentlemen of the House of Commons,
"Her Majesty has directed the estimates for the ensuing year to be aid befoze you. They have been prepared with every attention to economy, and with a due regard to the efiicient performance of the public service at home and abroad.
" My Lords and Gentlemen,
" Her Majesty commands us to inform you that bills will be submitted to your consideration for the consoidation and the amendment of impo2tant portons of the law; and Her Majesty doubts not that you will give your earnett attention to matters so deeply affecting the interests of il classes of her subjects.
" Her Majesty commands us to recomnmend to your consideration the expediency of renewing for a further periLd the privileges of the Ba~nk of England, the conditions im. posed on the issue of bank-notes in the united kingdom, and the state of the law relating to joint-stock banks.
" Her Majesty commands us to express the gratification whioh it affords her to witness the general well-being and contentment of her people, andto find that, notwithstanding the sacrifices unavoidably attendant upon such a war as that which has lately terminated, the resources of the country remain unimpaired, and its productive industry continu,s unchecked in its course of progressive development.
" Her Majesty commits with confidence the great interests of the country to your wisdom and care, and sbe fervently prays that the blessing of Almighty God may attend your deliberations and prosper your councils for the advancement of the welfare and happiness of her loyal and faithful people."
At the conclusion of the Speech the Commissioners and the Commons exchanged threeI(grmal bows, when the latter~ retired from the bar.
Prayers supplicating the Divine blessing on the deliberations of Parliament having been read by the Bishop of Lincoln, heir lordships then adjourned for the evening sitting.
The House resumed at 5 o'clock, and soon after that hour

ThankstotheloyaltyoftheFrenchEmperor,and the-frmness
of the statesmen of this country, these dangers had been averted; the objects for which we originally entered into the late severe struggle had been fully obtained, and the in. dependence of Turkey dh been placed upon a well defined. gound by the establishment of a natal barrier, which; indeed, appeared as though originally formed by Providenoe to be her protectmng boundazy againbt the aggressions of a powerful and enterprising neighbour. This opal djustment of the much-vexedEaster. question, in s manner caenlated to raise tbe positioni of England, and that withoutderogating from the dignity of her great adversary, wag m-inly due to the firm, unswerving, and fixed. line of policy maintained Upon that oocasdon byZer Majesty' Government. ButVJl paying this tribute to the si with which these negotiations hMA been conducted, their lotdships would, he felt assured, agree with him in thinking that too much praie could not-be givep to the conduct of the Englis people throughout these tranctions. (Hear, bear.) While showing, on the one hand, their wllingness to bear the necessary additional burdens to obtain the ends for which they had entered into the struggle, those ends once achieved they h4 ehibited to Europe the example of a people actuated by hiher motirve than mere national advantage or glory, and as disinterested in eounse1 as they were determined in action. (Hear, heak.) Whether the country for which Eo much hd been done and gained would prove worthy by her future. conduct of the efforts tbathadbeenmadeinherbeb lf yetremained. tobeseen; butitwasnottoomuchtoexpect'thatshe would qare no exertion in shaking oft the apathy anc! want of emergy, in her internal administration which had so long prevailed to her detriment, and which, but for extraneouas istance had nearly caused her to sac cumb at once to the attempts madeto placeher irre. eoverablylow inthescale of nations. The second point in. Heraestsx speech-vi., the impending settlement of the questions which aros inn consequence of the miserable attempts at insurrection made at Nechel lst summermust afford toeve yloterofpeacetheatisfction eprsed Iby HerMjesty. The consequenoes.which might have

But it was not theleso tme thxt for the protection of the insurgents and the 'arren question of a titular suzerainty he took arms, andwAs apparenty upon the point of entering upon a contest from which the courage and patriotigm of the Swiss would not have shrunl, in which the great countries of Europe must soon have become involved and
shich would probably nothave ended without the ovrtirowI of more than one established Govermment. This general dist-bauoe of the peace of Europe bad been happily avoided by well-timed and judicious counsels and mediation and we were relieved fromthegrave apprehension whichhad been so generally entertained. With respect to the state of our diplomatic relations with Naples, their lordahips, being well aware of the views strongly expressed by several of the plenipotentiaries at the congress of Paris on the dangers attending the King's persistence in Iis system of misgovernment, Could not have been surprised to learn that on the determined rejection by this Sovereign of the advice tendered to hin in the most friendly manner and with the best intentions by the Governments of England and rance those two Powers sould havo found no other course left to them but the withdrawal of diplomatic relations and the demonstration to the rest of Europe that they interets of humanity, overloo}the contempt of their remonstrances and, by the presence of theirrepresenttivesat that Cort continue to give indirect ranchtontoasystemroftyrand oppreson which inits folly threatened the tranqillity of Europe and in its cruelty disgraced the age to which we belong. Whatever differences of opinion might be entertained by their lord. sbips as to the right and expediency of interference on the part of one State in the internal administration of another, m this case, surely, if ever, the motives carried with them their ovmjustification, and surey, too, their beneficial re. sults were already becoming apparent in the terms recently offered by the King of Naples to his heretofore unfortunate prisoners. The first paragrah which called for congratulation was that in which Her Majesty informed them that she had been egagedin negotiations with the Government of the United Statee, and also wzith the Government of Honduras, which she trusted would be suocessful in removing all caulse of misunderstanding with respecttoCentral America. After the differences which lst year had threatened to disturb our amicable intercourse wnth that Govemrnment, their lordships must all rejoice that the impending misunderstnding had been happily averted, and that there was every prospect of a successful issue to the negotiations announced, lhich would cement our friendlyties with tbAt great ntion-sprung fromn the same origin as ourselves, shaing our language, holding m?any of our opinions, and closey connected with whom so many of our interests must ever remain bound up (HIear, hear.) Their lordships would also have beard with pleasure the announcement of the treaty concluded with Siam, there being every reason to believe that the commerco likely to be carried on between this countryand Siam would be to a large amount, and hi hly benefial to both counties. Her Majesty alluded with regret to the existing state of the relations between England and Persia It was unnecessary for him to follow e step the course of events as they had occurred since those relations were first trouhled by the hostile attitude assumed by the present Shah towards this country To all who had watched the progress of affairs in that qiarter it must have been evident

Biut the next measuare resorted to by the Shah, in open violation of an engagement of comparatively recent standing, and in defiance of every warning-namely, the siege of Herat, followed by the surrender of that town in October last-showed that forbearance must have a limit and that the hour of action had arrived.

(Hear, hear.) Their lordships mustalso feel gratified at the amicable termination of the quetAion between the King of Prui and Switzerltnd with respet to adeucptel ; and, for his own part without entering into the merits of that question, he cound not refrain fromaSre pressing his satisfaction at the gallant beaing of the Helvetco RepubhO. (Iear, hear.) Conscious of the persls of their situation, but undiersyed by the power of Prussiabuoyed up by no vain horsofglory, but ready to face every danger In defence of their liberties-the people of Switzerland had showno themselves to be worthy desceindants obthe beroes of Morgarten. a i was such men who had been in every age the true guardians of freedom, and he thought the Goernment desaeved the thanks of PArliament for the part they ha taken in preventing coion.between Prussia and the Swiss Cofdrtin HeaLr, hear.) The noble earl was then understood to refer to the oDneiiatory policy adopted by the Emperor of Austria towards his Italian sub-
h s-- outy awhich he was convinced would tend more tr ny the else o steo ng n and consot date the Austhian Enmpire. He also amaued with satisfaction to the negotiations now in progres for the amicable settlement of the qIestions at isue between Her Majcty and the Governmenart)f the United States with respect to Central Americ,s and e onratulated their lordshipg on the conclusion of a treaty o fliendship and cominerce with the King of Siam. It was not his intention,h seaid, to enter upon the muses which had ledtothe war with Persiab but he might be permitted to ate, as the opinion of evearyone who had stuaied thesubjed ct, that it was of the utm importancemt th tranquillty of our Indian empire that Heerats(hould remain independent, or, at al events, ethatit should niot he in the handis of ahoetile Power. Whatever miight have been the causes of the war, he hoped that the capture of Bushire and the gaIlstry displayed.by our military and naalforces might have the e.t of inducing the Shah to put an end to hostilitios;- but at the same timne, however we miight regret the existnce of a state of war, we ought not to forget that the postion of our Indfia eGmpire rendered us uuiable to avoid takming soe at in the affairs of Persia. (Hear, hear.) With reset to the affair at Canton certain dioubts had been expressed as to the mga character of the Arrow, but he believed that within the last 12 moniths more than one vesse having an unmistakeable British register had been seized by the Chirese authorities,and that many ino effectual attempts had been made to obtain redrss. More over, that there was a tolerably strong presumption in favour of the justice of our cause appeared from the fact that all the mnerchants en;gaed in thotrade with China ap-
provedthe masure of fre a optda atn n urgedthe Gvernent t perist i ther attmptword
suojECts nba no access to Canton it was quite clear that communication with that city could be maintained only by eurrespondence. He would not refer to the circumstances
nder which that communication had been interfered with, nor was it necessary for him to enter into the details of the seizure of the crew of the Arrow. All he would say was that it appeared to him the British Government had a petfeet right to act as they had done under the stipulations into which they had enterd with China. The noble earl, after a brief referenco to the subject of law reform, read the
ragraph in the Speech relating to the Bank Charter Act. He hoped it would not be necessary to make any alteration in thebnking system of this country, but if any such were necessary he trusted caro woud be tak n to proceed on the safest and most approved prindples. With regard to that
part of the Royal Speech which referred to the general wellbing and contentment of the people he was happy to find it borne out by those official returns which informued them of the extent of their commercial relations with other countries. A cornmp on of the imports and exports of 18A3, 1854, and 1855. showed a general, and marked improveineat, and one so great that the prosperity of the country was proved beyond dispute. The noblo emrl concluded by seconding the Address.
The Earl- of DERBY.-My Lords, I entirely concur in the observations of the noble earl who has this evening addressed your lordships for the first time, that this is not a proper opportanity for discussing in detail the topics referred to in the Speech from the Throne, involving, as they do, subjects of the grtest importance, and that this is not a fittng occasion for tetering into- the full consideration of ar,y one ofthose topics There aro various sugbjects adverted to in the Speech now before your lordships, upon

(Hear, hear.) I observed, my Lords, with somc anipriseand Ithink it iaother indication of the diaet#io;i of the noble earl who moved h Address-that, although-he carefully but brienly noticed every other topic o te Speech from the Throne, he was iltogether and' disreefty silent with regard to the renewal of the Bank charter. 'I hope that Iam justly attributin,g to the noble earl's a-sretion his silenoe upon that importat topic. I can imagine the noble lord at the head ot Her Majestys Government, when instructing the noble earl as to the points' upon wfhich it was desirable that he should dwell, informing hlim that the less he said with reference to the Bank charter, and the mor careful he Was not-to commit Her Majesty'e Government ont that subject, the better satisfied they Would be. Not doubting the discretion of the noble earl, I think, however, I may assume that, like Hotspur'a wife, he a'bined from stating the precise cours. whioh the Government intend to pursue on this importaut subject,--. becatsu "he couladnot utter what he did not know." (LAught4r.) In one of the pargrps of the Royal Speech Her xjisty, reeommends to our consideration, Arst, "the expediency of renewing for a further period the privileges of the Bank of England f next that we hould'eonsider " the conditions inmposed on the isue of banknotes in the unIted Idom " and, thirdly, that we should consider "the state of the law relating to jointstock bankms) I trut Her Yajesty'

In 1853 a very comprehensive and able budget was submitted to Parliament; and, although I cannot concur in the extravagant amount of encomium which 'WsS bestowed uponthat bidgetas an absolutely unsg,rpaased financial meaure, yet it undoubtedly possesssd this great merit-that it took a broad and comprehensive view of tbh stabe Of 0ar national finances. Although I dissented from some of the propositions contained in that badetalthough I thought it a grave injustice to maintin taxes which pressed with peculiar hardship upon particular interests-yet there was in ita degree of comprehensiveness which redeemed Many Of its defects, and, above all others, one principlewslaid down which Ihold to boof the utmost importance-namely, a positive pledge that beyond the year 1860 the income-tax should not be maintained. fCheers.) Now, I say that Parliament will not do their duty if they are sAtisfied with less than the full bond ffdc execution of that pledge. (Renewed cheers.) That pledge was ratified by an act of Parliament now in force, which was suspended during the period of the war aud for such a period as Her Majesty's Government thought necessary after the termination of the war, in order to moet the expenses of hostilities; it was suspended by an act which not only continued, but which very laigely increased the heavy burden of the income-tax; and, lor the purposes of the war, but with a strict limitation to those purpos the public generously andmagnanimously sbmittedtosthe sacrifices which were required from them, confident in the good faith of the Govenment that the tax was henceforth to be a war tax-a tax of tremendous power, an instrument of vast energy and effect, exhibiting in the stronRest degree to foreign countries the immensity and the power of our resources for war, but a tax whicb, if not limited to the purposes of war, is an instrument which it would be daugerous to intrust in the hands of any Minister. (Cheers Although this ubiect is rtot one for your lordship' speoi consideration, yet deply as you are interested int personally, and deeply as you are Interested in it also wit; reference to the public welfare, I could not allow this, the first opportunity of the session, to pass without expressing my confident hope and belief that Parliment wm insist upon the full aud entire fulfilment of that pledge by which in 1860 the income-tax will -cease to be imposed (Cheers) By far the largest and by far the most unsatifactory portion of the Royal Speech is devoted to the subject of our foreign relations. I cannot read this portion of the Speech without regretting those goodold days when the stereotyped passage of the Royal Speech, containing in a single par rph all reference to foreign affairs, stated thatHis hl?jesty or HIer Majesty was hap2y to inform Parliament that hhe or she continued to maintamn the most friendly relations with al foreign Powvers. Now., I will
venture to say that that single paragraph would giOm moro atisfacton to tbepcoploof tnis country, and would afford a better security for tho peac of Europe, than all the multitudinous paragraphs in the Speech which has just been read to us, referring, I am sorry to say, in every instance, to disputes partial or not entirely settled, and to questions moreor ess complicated. Her jestyisscarcely able to refer with unmitigated satisfacton to our foreign relato
with any State, uless, indeed, it he to the important fact that " er 3fqesty has concluded a treaty of friendship and commerco with Siam. (Laughter.) I do not wish-to seak with levity of that treaty, or of the consequences which
may result from it. I believe the present King of Siam to be a man of considerable intelligenco and energy, who appreCiateS the advantages of eivilization, and who entertainsthe most friendly disposition towards thiscountry eormy own part, I should always rejoice at every extension of our commercial relations, o long as they do not tend, as SometimeS they do, to place us a positions inconsistent with the prosecution of peaceful enterprise. I rejoice, therefore, to hear of the conclusion of a treaty which may-promoto tommercial intercourse, and which msy strengthuen our friendly relations even with the ling of Sianm. Another para-

My Lords, as we me nowatpeaoe, and as I trust in God thlt peace wil long be maintained, I cannot hut regret that the noble earl who opened the discussion should have indulged inl -some expressionnDOt very complimentary to the gooedfaith of- that potentate with whom we have lately been aar, and-with whore we have now oncluded peaee, I have always thought and have always

Observations upon what has fdlen .fromn-the noble ierl in tha arme 0zder in which he has noticed the principial topics. of the Speech;-I .lusb,exptris mrny. entire agree ent-.with himn 1pon the propriety- and impgrtaneeof 40t-permitting One word -of dirspect 'or bitternesa to fall froIm isagainst that great Power withW which we were recently.. at war. I aninquite certai that; such was not the -intention of my noble friepd who ioved the Address, and I am pear¢saed thab no member of, your lordships' House will so far forgetwbhat is dne tatbedignity andtotheinterests.of thecountry as to fall.into pch an error. (Rear.) With respect to thesdifficulty which took place In the execution of the Treaty of Paris your lordships are aware that there,are two Bolgrads, but that oniy. one of them was marked on the mip. The Russian Plenipotentiazy requested that-the Bolgrad which wiason the map shionld be retained byRussia, because it was the capital of ' the Bulgarian provinces, and the line was accordingly drawx in accordance with his wishes; because, by acceding -to them, the objects of the treaty were not interfered with, while to have refused comnpliande with that which was but i natural wish would' have boen nothing less than a gratuitoua digcourtesy. 'No more was heard npon. the subjeqt unfil the Boundary Commissiokers arrived upon the groincd, and then the Russian CommiWsioners elaimed the right to draw the lille south of a neow olgradwhich had never been heard of before. It was evident to us that this Bolgrad was unknown to the Congrese, that It would give to Russia an important advintage vhich was never contemplated, and that if would have defeated the objects of the treaty. ' Still, Russia per sidted in her claim to that as the Bolgrad wlhich had been ceded by the Congress. The admission of this claim to the new B0olgrad, however, wotld have been a distinct con. cession to Russia which three of the contracting parties to the Treity of Paris' determined that they would not make, because 'it would give her an important strategeti6al position, woulidbring her into connexion with the Danube, and would cut off the ceded portion of Moldavia from Moldavia proper. If, in consequence of this, we had called the Congress together, so far from settling the question, it would only have made it more notorious, and would perhaps have rendered irreeoncileable the differenee which existed between the Powers. In that state of things, therefore, it appeared that the only wa-y of settling the matter was, if I may so express it, by an "arrangement out of doors." The Emperor of the French accordingly proposed a plan which was agreed to by the several parties, and which by no means involves the concessions which the noble earl apr,ars to imagine; because by it both Bolgrads*remain to Moldavia, and Russia is not brought nearer to the Danube, or essentially nearer to the Pruth. She obtains, bowever, a small addition to her Bewsarabian territory, and she obtains, also, a small town which will hereafter be the capital of her Bulgarian colony. The territory ceded by Russia was altogether ceded to Moldavia; but as Moldavia has no ships and no force to maintain order at the mouths of the Danube, the Porte attached great importance to the islands in the delta of the Danube and to Serpents Island being Tarkish instead of 3foldavian. That was agreed to. The protocols which explained the acts of the conference which met at Paris I have laid upon your lordships' table this evening; but we do not propose to lay upon the table any other papers on the subject, because it has not been the custom, and because I think it wise to adhere to precedent in such a case, and not to produce correspondence zelating to differences with foreign countries which have been amicably settled, and when the production, of tliem, without any good end in view, mightgivvfise agaiu to feelings of illwill which I rejoice to think hie'iiemocompletely allayed by a conclusion satisfactory to al parties. (Hear.) I next come to the question of Neuchitel, and i[ agree with the noble eal opposite that the men who embarked in that recldess enterprise on the 4th of September -an enterprise which contained within itself no one single element of success, were inflauenced, by *the pnrest motives, and were stimulated only by feelings of loyalty and allegiance. I do not wish to enter into any details upon this subject, because, as your lordships are aware from the announcement made by Her *ajesty, negotiations are now going on with a view to the amicable settlement of the question at issue, and I should deeply regret if, upon a matter which concerns more the honour than the material interests of the parties engaged, any imprudent expression of opinion were to mar the success of thoae negotiations. I n ust, however, take leave to say that the pro too ol of London of 1852, so far from aswering the description given of it by the noble earl, setled no question whatever. It was at most but a saspenEion of the question. By it the King of Prussia, simply renounced resorting to means of coercion for the purpose of asserting his rights, uponcondition that the other parties to the protocolsbould endeavour to obtain the recognition of those rights. The protocol, indeed, did not even pretend to settle the 'question, because the longer the de fato Government in NeachAt el lasted the more difficult it becametothe KingofPrtm ia toassert hisrights by himself, and the more difficult also it became to the other Powers, on the supposition that they wished to assist him, to adopt measures with that view. That was the reason why theeconference was not brought together again. The conference could have re-assembled only for the purpose o° authorizing the King of Prassia to coerce the Swiss Means were taken to ascertain whether there was any method by which the Swiss people could be induced, by negotiation, to recognize the King of Prussia and restore him to the enjoyment of his rights. There were found to b3 none, and therefore the conference was not called together again. (Hfear, hear.) I have now to give to the charge-if I may call it so-which the noble earl has brought against Her Majesty's Government of having encouraged the Swiss to refuse the mediation of France, and to proceed with the trial of the Royalist prisoners, the most direct and unqualified denial. (Hear, hear.) We thought that a peremptory demand for the release of the prisoners would amount to an unjustifiable interferonce with a matter of which the Swiss Government ought to be the sole judges. The Royalists had lived for years under a Government which they termed illegitimate, but which was, at least, the defacto Government, and, having enjoyed its protection for so long a period, they had no right all at once to stir up insurrection, and by bloodshed and civil war endeavour to destroy the existing state of things. It was impossible we could deny that the acts of these men ought to be submitted to judicial decision, and therefore we did not call upon the Confederation to set the prisoners unconditionally at liberty. But we said that if the King of Prussia would offer conditions we would advise the Confederation to forego its strict right. The King made known to the Emperor of the Prench the terms on which he was willing to treat. Those terms were not commnunicated tous, but we did not advise the Confederation to refuse them ; we simply abstained from giving to the Federal Government anyassurance upon a matter of which we were iguorant. We put it to the Swiss Government whether their intetests would not be served by'the liberation of the prisoners; but at the same time, although we united our efforts with those of tho Emperor of the French in order to bring about a settlement of the Swiss Government, in the sense desired by the Confederation, we did not pledge ourselves to that of which we knew nothing. (EHear, hear.) The noble earl has condemned in unqualified terms the course pursued by the Paris Congress with respect to Italy, and has stated, greatly to my surprise, that we are ch rgeable with having failed to fulfil the promises we made to Sardinia. It would appear, according to the noble earl, that for joining' her forces to those of the aUies in the Criunme, Sardinia was to obtain certain advantageswhich she hasnotreceived. Now,mylords,I can conscientiously say that I have heard that statement for the first timethis evening. (Hear, hear.) Nopromise of the kind was ever made to Sardinia. Your lordships have before you the despatches and papers connected with the treaty entered into three years ago with the Sardinian Government. No offer was made to Sardinia ; no terms were asked by her; nothingwasrequired from us except that:amountofpecuniary assistance which was necessary to enable Sardinir to placa a large army in the Crimea. (Hear, hear.) But I t,inlr my lords, that the members of the Congress at Paris wvere justified in holding the language they did. If the great Powers of Europe represented at Paris had neglected that opportunity of calling attention to the state of Italy and the system of government in existence there they wrould, in my opinion, have been liabie to censure.
entirely agree with the nohie earl as to the inexpediency and
danger of one or more States interfering in the internal affairs of another; but I am convinced that if ever an exception was justified it was in the case of Italy. For the interest of humanity, for the sake of the welfare of the Neapolitans, in order to prevent revolution, it was the duty of the Powers represented at Paris to protest against the system of government established in Southern Italy. The Governgens of France and England acting in concert, determined to make sim-altaneous representations to the Government of Naples, that certain acts of grace and amnesty should betoken a change of policy. An answer was returned to these representations, couched, as the noble earl has remarked, in not very courteous terms. We were told to mind our own business. But no notice was taken of that communication; we hoped that reflection might induco the King of Naples to reconsider hts decision and to ndota system of government more in hamony with the spiit ofthe age. We received a second comimunication from the Government of Naples, apologizing for the terms of the flrst but holding oat no hope of a change of polic The allied Governments then thought the time had arri;ed for maing a public protest sainst the existing state of things in Naples, and accordingly thb En&lish and French missions were simultaneonsly recalled. Now, my lords, nobody, I think can say that the two Governments were not acting vithin the strictest limits of their legitimate rights. Nobody can say that England and France were not at liberty to protest against such a system of government as thatrr ed in Naples, and not to encourape ty the presence of their Ministers a policy so fraught with danger. I believe that many subjects of the Ringregretted that the Ministers were withdrawn in the mnahner described by the noble earl; I believe tb4t many would have gremtly preferred a naval demonstration; but we had every reason to thinkthatanavaldemonstration would haveproduced an inltrrection, I know not what the result of a great
zsess at the four ports is most f^vourablo as compared with Canton, We have 'the -atisftotijo of knowing that the factories, which axe not always agree,, are unauimously of opinion, without distinction of nationality, that in4thisr matter the British Government has only dono that which was -necessary and for the interests of all. Everybody felt that sooner or later this must come, and nusr that it has come -n3 r are dthatwohavetakenthebestcoure. The United Stes' Uommissioner has given orders to the American qcommanders-to take active steps to support ns, and I see by a letter I-r4ceived from Washington this morning that the
ew.s had been received there wish great approbation. I can Sonlyhopethat, in the present as in the formner war, by assertang onr treaty rights, and, above all, by standing by our 'dag, which is onx onlyprotection in that country, veoshall not onlasuccessfully settle the present dispute, hut lay the loon-dation of a great exitension of our trade with China. (REear.)
Earl GREY.-I quite concur with the noble earl opposite, -who began his speech by referring to a general desire that the Address in answer to Her Majesty's Speech should in this House be agreed to with unanimity. At tho same time there is a passage in the S peech to which I cannot assent, and on which I intend, therefore, to move an amendament. I allude to the reference to the war with Persia. I shouldc -have liked to point out why I regard the answer made iby the noble earl (Clarendon) both as to the affairs of Naples and the rupture with China as by no means satisfactory; but I shall confine my observations strictly to the paragraph 'in the Address which, as I have already indicated, pledges xne to opinions which I for one do not entertain. The Address is so framed as to pledge us to an expression of regret that the conda ct of the Persian Government has led -to the hostilities between the Shah and our own country; and reference is made to tho justice of our demands. Now, -this plainly assunes that the entire blame of tho war rests -upoA Persia; whoreas, although I have no wish to commit yo4,trdships' House prematurely to an opinion one waY -orthe other, I believe that this. war is neither just nor politic. Tlho Address is also defective from tho absence of any allusion in it to the important constititional question raised by the noble earl opposite with regard to the carrizang on of hostilities without Ministers having previously recommended the Sovereign to appeal to her Parliament for its advice and support. The GovernorGeneral of India issued to the world, on the 1st of Novem-berlast, a proclamation in which he expressly states that he -sets under the immediate directionsof Her Miajesty's Go-veroneat, and which sets forth both the grounds of the war and our vindication for entering into it. We are 'therefore furnished with authentic information as to the -canses and origin of the war, and I am prepared to maintain, without knowing what may be the reply of Persia, -that, even on the showing of our own Government, the war is indefensible. It is said that an agreement between this country and the Shah has been violated; but I hold that -the ,mere breach of an engagement OR the one side or the other, without reference to the nature of that engagement or to the surrounding circumstances, does not necessarily justify or render expedient a declaration of war. The nmagnitude of the interests involved, and the possibility or impossibility of obtaining redress by milder means, ought to be fairly weighed before recourse is had to the last alternative-the sword. Otherwise a free course is left to the encroachnernts of great States upon their weaker neighbours. Russia is often charged with a habit of inveigling her rude neighbou-s into rashly putting their hands to imprudent -treaties, and tben, when their stipulations are broken through, with making that a pretext first for war, and subsequently for their conquest. But this insidious policy has always been regarded as rendering Russia not less but more dangerous. Similar reproaches have been cast upon England for making entangling treaties with the petty chiefs of India, and then making the infraction of them the ground for warfare and the ultimate absorption of their territory. But, be these accusations well or ill-founded, I trust that I shaU not hear the doctrine laid down in this house that any violation of a treaty between us and Persia is a sufficient warrant for war, irrespective of the nature of that treaty and the attendant circumstances. The wholo discussion must turn upon the nature of the agreement. Its substance is, that Persia engages not to invade Hlerat. Now, I want to know what principle of the law of nations authorizes one independent country to take upon itself to dictate so another what course it shal pursuein i ts relations with other States ? Persia might have ada legitimate cause of quarrel with her neighbour. I saw it stated at a public meeting the other day bya zealous missionary who has laboured. long and faithfully in those countries that the original ground of dispute between Persia and Herat some years ago was, that the people of the latter place, with the connivance of their Government, persisted in making plundering excursions into the Persian territory for the purpose of carrying off its inhabitan' a and seling them as slaves. If that be so, nobody can doubt that such outrages constitute the most valid excuse for war. I .am quite ignorant of the facts of the case on this point; but at may be that good cause for war against Herat has been given to Persia - and I totally deny that we have any right to dctate to independent States in what manner they shall vindicate their rights, and punish the invasion of them by -their neighbours. But, even supposing Persia to be in the wrong in her quarrel with Herat, who, I ask, gave us ths authority to regulate and prescribe the relations between -the barbarous or semi-barbarous people of Central Asia? It is asserted that the advance of Persia upon Herat, of which we so much complain, actually took place at the instigation of the ruler of Herat himself. If the ruler of Herat thought it Ihis intereet to invite the protection of Persia against any attack with which he was threatened -the.law of nations gaveusno title whatever to interfere. I know it has been held by no mean authority that it is our Jbusiness to watch over the politics of Asia, in order to check the rise of any Power likely to endanger our Indian dominion; but, setting aside all questions as to our right <lo act on this principle, I contend that its practical adoption IS altogether unwise and inexpedient. Whatever migt have formerly been the position of our Indian empire, unoubtedly we have nothing- to fear for it now from any other Asiatic Power. Its resources are so great, its superiority, cunsequent upon our modern inventions and our civilized arts of war, is so enormous compared with that of any senmi-eivilized nation, that even if all the independent States of Asia united were to attack us we need not have the slightest apprehension for the result. The late luLke of Wellington did not express too high an opinion of our superiority when he stated, in expltnaton of the difficultics attendant upon Oriental warfare, -hat the difficulty of keeping up the communications and of obtainuig constant supplies was so great that 5,000 British troops could defeat any Asiatic force that might be brought into the field against them, and mnight, if adequately suphlied, be eaily marched from one end of Asia to the other. ngland, we are assured, has no occasion to fear any Asiatic Power, but we are told that we must watch over -Central Asia, lest Russia should mnake through it a road to our Indian empire. Now, I think this is quits as much of a chimera as the other. If there is one lesson to be learnt more than another from the late war, it is that, however powerful Rassia may be in self-defence, whatever credit she deserves for defending a fortress at the extremity of her empire for nearly a year against the united power of four nations, her strength for offensive warfare is very limited. If Russia accumulating her resources during a long peace, many years of which had been sedulously devoted -to the task of creating a powerful army and of perfecting the no 1iril of war, was able to do so little in offensive operations against Turkey beforo the allies caame to her assistance-if she coald bring so small a force under the walls of Silistria, which may be said to be almost at her own door-what reason is there to beheve -that she could bring to our frontier in India any force with which it would not be an act of insanity to undertake any campaign against our forces? If we conld not supply our army with proper necessaries at a distance, of- 1,500 miles, -l of which, with the exception of some seven miles we were able to traverse with oar ships-if we found this too hard a task for us in the first year of the late wardo you think it possible that -Russia could provide for 150,000 men (and I believe.-that even this number would be insufficient for the purpose) to march entirely by land almost as great a distance as separates us from the Crimea ? Could she convey that - force, --with the requisite artillery and supplies,-to -the -frontiers-of our Indian empire. I think a moment's reflection by any man who will allow his reason fair plsy, and who -will not give way to this bugbear of Russian pewer,-will satisfy him that such an invasion is impossible. Bat then I -know 'what is the answer to this. We are told it is not Russia dir otly -that we have to fear, but it is Russia wielding the power of Persia and of other Asi3tic countries between our territory and hers. My lords, before Russia can bring these countries into a condition -ia which she can. use -them for her own- purposes- she has to achieve a task even more difficult- than that -which - we have accomplished in. the. creation of our gre t Indian enspire. She. has to bring into order and sub-servience the tribes of Asia-the_most insabordinate; ths most lawless, time fiercest people on-the face of the earth, divided f roin -each other b allsortsof animoeities springing
out oc religion and race,-to make an - alliance with one of
whom is infallibly to make an enemy of the other. (Rlear,
hear.) She has, I say, to bring all these various tribes into -order. She has to disciplineand to-organize them in countrie, which do nut PQssess the elensents of union and organization; all this she must do before she can wieldehatribesof Central Asia to oar damage. Why, even if she could command a succession of such men as Clive and Warren HEastings, this would bh the work of generations, and, in my opinion, no poliitical foresight or wisdom is displayed in providing againsbt
,dangers so distant. But grant tbat the danger is not distant. -Grant that you have that reasol to fear Russia in India which some people of active imaginations suppose. In that case I assert stil more strongly that the plicy upon which you have acted is altogether erroneous. H you are afraid thatRussia will, wield against you th'e power of Central Asia, what -is the flrst thing you ougHt to endeavour to secure? Why, you should first of all beon goodtermns with Persia (hear); you-shouldendeavonr to make Persiaso strong and powerful that it would not be likely to fal -under Russian ascendancy, Now, let any man tell me whether the war which we have now commenced is not calculated in avery way to play the game of Russia, not of England, anto create a state of things in Persia favon.rable t#2 those designs which you so gratnitonsly impute to the Czar. Yoea want to be on good terms with Persia. Are you likely- to conduce to this object when yom arrogantly claim a right which you would- never dream of insisting on in the case of any European Power-when yom say that Persia shall not pursue, without your permision, that policy which she thinks fit with regard to her near neighbours? Is it likely to promote good feeling between England and PasUia when, without any proper prolamation of war, you invade her eountry, -alaughteor her troops while
defending thei- own holnes,alsd tako-possession of peaceable cities ? IsaaY $ba tho6e proceedings of the Englishs tGoverumfut- at Bualsire- will not be forgotten for many

now--takin-g: such steps as are likely to-acbn plish- yout 1 object? We know- that partly by intimilation, partly ' by corruption,- ussia is abten i infiu; ence in Persia; but we alSo know that-there is rot a 8ingte 1 Persian, from the bMonarch who sits on the;throrne down'to his meanest subjeoN who does not feair and dtae Runssia as the enemny of his country and of his religion. We Saow that that is the feeling prevailing among the Persians, inad therefore, unless you drive them to seek for support 'against you, they wil most undoubtedly admnit your natutal ascendancy. If, on the other baud, you make wai against Persia -if you, with your gigantic power, attack that weak country, what resource has she? She must, willingly or' unwillingly, throw herself into the arms of Russia; and thus you are accomplishing that which you believe to be the aim of the Russian Government and people. If -Persia is com-
pelled, either directly or indirectly, to admit Russian ascen-' dancy-if she-is driven to employ Russian officers to comrmand her-troops, and to avail herself of Russian skill and discipline-she-.ill undoubtedly very soon be in t'he poaition of the horse in the fable, who applied to manto assist hios against his adversary. Again -I say, then, that it is for our interest to-make Persia strong and powerful. Does it conduce to-that object when you lay waste her territory slaughter her soldiers; and destroy the small amou:t of regular force which she -possesses? Bat then, I am told, we are doing all this for the sake of Herat, and my noble friend below me has given us a description of the advantages and, resources possessed by that city. I have little doubt, my- Lords, that Herat does possess great natural resonrces, but what claim havo we in any ay to it ? We all know that among all the il-governed States of Asia -that among all the people who are most disorderly, Herat and its inhabitants enjoy an unenviable perspiouity. When Herat was attacked by Persia on a previous occasion it was saved by the extraordinary gallantry of Sir H. Pottinger, and when the city was saved its inhabitants- turned -upon their brave defender, and- treated him with the greatest contumely, going so 'far even as to tbreaten him with violence, and finally compelled him to leave the town which he had saved; -and upon every occasion tbeyhave thoroughly disregarded your wishes. We say now that Herat sball remain independent, and that it shall not be taken by Persia or annexed to Affghanistan. We-tell Persia thatwe will go to war if she attacks Herat, and we promise her to try and prevent Dost Mahommed from aunnexng it to his territories. Now, I confest, my Lords, that this appears to sue a most extraordinary policy, when- our -real interest isto create in those countries some great-nd-powerful State,a thing which is impossible if Herat remain independent. I maintain, my Lords,that in endeavouring to regulate-according.to your own notions of vhat is to your intetest-the political relations of the tribes of Central Asia, ou bhave undertaken a:tasl which is worse than'useless, which is, in fact, impossible. It is impossible because these couhtries are in a state of continual change. You cannot be sure that the principles professed to-day by one tribe may not be to-morrow entirely changed. This has been the case from time immemorial in those countries. -We-have one day one powerful chief rsing up, and another day another foundina power which becomes dangerous to-his neighbours, which afterwards declines, and eventually falls into decay. In the same way their political relations with each other are continually undergoing change, and the bitter enemies of today-become the allies of to-morrow. In such a state of-things it is vain to attempt to regulate tho political affairs of those countries, and if. you do' attempt it yoie are exposed, after sPending time, labour, treasure, and sonietimes even life, in bringing about some political combina;tion, to the chance of a change taking -lsee,: and of being then compelled to make the most strenuoss efforts to defeat the very object which you previously had in view. A very strong instance of Nvhatfl am saying is afforded by the very country the affairs of -which we are now disoussing, At the beginning of the century Sir J. Malcolm-vas sent by Lord Welesley on a mission which was attended with very considerable expense, and which-threw a serious burden or the finances of India, and the object of. which was to induce the Shah of Persia to march an army upon Herat. How, then, cau the Persians think your policy consistent in now rotecting Berat, or that you can have any right to do so, *ehn they know that scarcely 50 years ago you epent large sums of money and bribed all- her courtiers, ini order to: accomplish the very object against which you aLre, DOw struggling ? At present it appears that we Lre close allies of- Dost Mlahommed. -Why, my Lords, it is only seven or eight years ago that we committed the fatal error,-and I am bound -to take my full share of the blame, as I was a- that time -a member of the Administration,-of goingto war inordertodeposeDostYahommed,nan
to substitute for him some-pfilic whom we supposed to be more favourable to our views. I say, my Lords, that to attempt to regulate the affairs of the States of Central Asia, aud I say the same with regard to Persia, is had policy, and is weU calculated to defeat the object which you have in view. Among all the tribes of Central Asia there exists great jealousy of the British rule. Each tribo knows that every State which has been brought in contact with the British rule has gradualy been absorbed by it, kamd each fears that the same fate may await itself. It isimpossible, my Lords, to enter into diplomatic relations withthese people, or to take part in the quarrels which divide them, wit out increasing those feelings of jealousy and suspicion. It is impossible for us to take part in their relations to each other, to support one and oppose another, witboub irritating aU parties. A gen. tieman, one of the most eminent in the Indian service, said to me some time back that he had neverlknown a close alliance between a civilized and a barbarous State which did not in less than three years end in hatred between them. I myself, my Lords, am of opinion that the only method of keeping upon pood terms with the people of India is to have as little dealng with them as possible. If you make treaties with them, they are so shorghted aund iinprovident that they will infallibly commit a breach of them, and then you are placed in the position which the noble earl hasindicated as our position with regard to Persia, and are liable to be asked if you are willingt injure the prestige of
Egadinthe East by not resnting that breach of faith.- If we have diplomatic dealisgs with these people, weare sure to find ourselves in the position of bemn compelled to make choice between submitting to open ins0t, of having solemn stipulations broken, or engaging in costly and hazardous enterprises in a poor and pitiful eountry. I think that no danger threatens our Indian empire which is so great as would be a further extent of territory to the north and north-west. On that side the frontier is so well placed that an army collected in a fertile district could be brought at once to crush any invading enemy as soon as the heads of his columns emerged ftom passes of great difficulty. If you have dils)nmatie dealings with the people of Central Asia yon are sure to be drawn into a quarrel, and Indian ouarrels nave always ended in the annexation of teiritory. You will, then, if you go further, acquire a poor and difficult country, inhabited y men bold, active, and energetic loving their independence, trained to arms from their earliest infancy, and so poor that it would be utterly impossible to obtain from them the means of paying any portion ofthe expenses of the war. You wil acquire a territory. from which, when once obtained, it will he extremely difficult to withdraw, and which you eannot maintain without great expense and danger. I have made these observations for the purpose of showing that the policy of this war is bad; and I must now say a few words unon the question of its justice; because, whatever may be the policy, I think that the firs' question which we should always consider ii the justice of a war. (Hear, hear.) Surely, my lords, wi are all agreed that war is almost the greatest scourge which can afflict mankind, and that therefore an awful responsibility presses upon that nation wbich engages in it without necessity. I believe also that I am following the highest authorities when T say that a case of neoessity for war can only be made out from circumstances which directly or indirectly resolve themselves into considerationis
of self-defence-and that it is for self-defence alone, that any nation is justified in making the awful appeal to arms. (Hear, hear.) There is no question that on the face of it we are the aggressors in this case, because we invaded the Persian territory. I grant that an apparently aggressive war may sometimes turn out upon inquiry to be strietly one of self-defence; but, in order to make it so, you must be able to show that you attack your enemy in order to anticipate an attack with which you yonrselves are threatened, or to avert some great and certain danger. Nowv, when I examine the proclamation of the Govenor-General of India, I do not see it stated there that Persia meditated any attack upon Great Britain, or upon any British possession whatever. The proclamation is equally silent with regard to any great peril or certain danger which the war is intended to avert. I maintain, therefore, upon these grounds that we aro engaged in a war which is not consistent either with a wise view of our real interests or with the higher principles of justice. (Hear) You have, moreover, entered upon this -war without affording Parliament at the -proper time any opnortunity whatever of expressing an opinion upon it. I find that the proclamation was dated on the lst of November, and that the expedition sailed from Bombay on the 13th of the same month; and, as both those measures were ordered from home, it is obvious that the order to invade Persia mnst have been sent from this country not later than thmiddle of September. I say, then, that when Her Majesty's Government determined on making war with Persia and sent out those orders, it was their bounden duty at the same time to advise the Crown to caU Parliament together and to appeal in the usual form to Parlia. ment for support. (" Hear, hear !" from the OpPosition.) Since we have had a Parliamentary government 1 challenge yeu to produce any one instance in which this country has engaged in war without the Ministers of the Crown having
tboughtix t their duty, so soon as war was resolved uo,t commurnicate that imoran dterminiation to Parliament.
(Rear, hear.) No dubt the preroative of making peac
ad war rests withl the Crown, and I tbink that it oughtto rest there; hut, if the prerogative of the -Crown is undoubted, the privilege and duty of Parliament to exercise its judgment on the manner in which that rrogative irs exercised by the advisers of the Crown is equally unqdCetioned; and it has always hitherto been held to be the duty of the se vnts of the Crown to take care that Parliament had the earlie-st opportunity of expressing its j; udgment upon theo
noatter. (eaii, hear.) Ifow what the answer wilbhe.

(Hear.) The mairn difficulty w;hich.- arose was, not upon tLhe interpretation of some doubtful pihrase, but upon the delineation of the boundary which was laid down ia the sna ad described in the terms of the treaty ; and I am tol-rbut it is so inicredible that I shall scarcely believe it until the noble earl tells me that I hiave been correctly told that it is really the fact that the map upon which the 'whole constructionx of the treaty turned,as it deline-ated and 'was the authentic record of that which. was for thd'future 'tobe the boundary of the,two emp ires,was notparmph6ed. that is, the signatures of the Plenipotentiaries were not affixed to it. WVhy, my Lords , if youL buy but a field the miap delineating its boundaries is always attached to the instru. 3nent 6f purchase and formas part of it, andl yet in a question -which was to settle the boundiries of empires, in which the 'line of demarcation was the very point of all others to which the attention of the Plenipotentiaries ought to have been turned, it appers that there is no evidence of the authenticity of the instrmnent upon which our Pleni. 'potentiaries had to rely in support of their interpretation of the treaty. That is a circnmstance not very credlitable to the clearasightedness and, Irmay-say,to the business-likeo habits of Her Majesty's Government.. (Hear, hear.) It is a point which ought to have been carefully attended to, in order that no second conference might he mecessary. Buat does it niot strike, your lordships that the language of Her Majesty's Government, of the leading mnembers of the Government, of the head of the Govern. nient in fact, when that xecond conference was proposed, was very inconsistent with the satisfaction. now exressed at the results of that conference!? (Hear, hear. ) recollect very well' the tone and the language then employed. I do niot mean by that portion of the press wh ich -appear to be at the disposal of Her Mfajesty's Govern-ment, but by the 0 1ters themselves-by the Firt Lord of the Treasur at Manchester. Then the Binperor of Russia, was to be compelled to mnaintain good faith and to fulfi the treat to the -very letter, without allowing any question, any difference, or any discussion of its obligations, according to the sense in which Enigland understood it. There were to be no more* confeinenes, our :feet was to be sent into thefllaok Sea, and we were not to be satisfied without a stricj; and, literal fuLlfilment of the terms -of tlid tir~aty. That was the' noble viscou:.tVs declaration at Manchester, aLnd it was cheered to th eqho as bold, spirited, and manly. And yet, inx spite -of all these fine words, the noble viscount, by the advice of his allies, or it many be by something more than their advice, was compelled to refer these mnatters to another conxference, and only obtained his own construction of the treaty by the cession of territo±'y beyond that proposed inx the original. conference. This may be a satisfactory arrangement, and I trust it will be, and now that peace is restored 1 hope there wil be on all sides an adlherence to the letter and spirit of the treaty, and that we shall not hear from the public men and fromn the pdblic journals-who I miust say do in£nite miischief by their intempeane and indiscretion-any more of that vio1ent, abuse of tThsewcho were lately our adversaries, which I ama convinced is a serious obstacle to the preservation of good relations. (Hear.) I cannot but regret also that the noble earl shouldt have characterized as a "1paltry, maiserable insurrection," the misguided eforts of those Royalists in the canton of N~euchitel who rose to restore what they believed to be their lawful Government. MisuidLed they undoubtedly were-erroneous their views may rsave been-~uifortunate 'they certxinly have been-their efforts were put down ; but I never yet heard anly man throw a doubt on the sense of allegiance and loyalty by which they were guided. Whatever their misfortunes and errors mnay have been1 this is not the country in which to speak lighstly of allegance and loyalty. (Hear, hear.) I certainly did entertain a hope that this matter was not only in course of being settled, but that it actually hadl been settled satisfactorily, and I regret to find from the Royal Speech that that is not the case. I may be permitted to say a few words with regard to the claim of the King be Prussia, becaiue it was at a period when I was cennected with the Gover-nent that that protocol was signed in London unon 'which it is said the King of Prussia now founds his claim. I must beg your Lordships to look hack for a single moment at what was then the condition of Europe. France was then in a most un nt stato. The famious words "L'Empir'e
lc'c. la pcexT'jadnot then been uttered; indeed, the empire did rot then exist. The public mind in France was gra waithte.* Piedmont, Switzerland, and Belgium were looking wt great alarm to the solutioni of the questions then pending. France was makisg demands upon them inconsistent with their national honour and isdpnd d ence, and the state of affairs was altogether, exceenl critical. I shall ever consider st a great saLisfatinha the Government with wrhich I was connected by their good offices and by the maoderation of the parties concerned were instrumental in settling this question in a mnanner not comp~romising to the independence and honiour of Swteln, and at the same time satisfactory to the just demands of Fra-nce. But precisely at that time we were called upon by the King of Prussia not to take any active steps on his behalf, nior to 'enforce the right which he claimed, but to recognize the existence de jure of certain rights, nLot very well defined, and perhaps mlot very easil recondileable with the subsequent relations of Neuchfitel Your lordships will observe that these rights were confirmed to the King of Prussia-or rather to the Prxince of NeuchsfAW, for Prussia as a kingdom has mothing to dowith the question, it only affects the interests ,of the Prince of Nenchfitel,who happens to be Kingof Prussia also-by the treatie of 1815, which it was of the utmost importance at that time to the peace of ERompe to preserve from infringement. They were the treaties, too, by which the independence and neutrality of Swi6zerland were guaranteed, I'earrangement Her Majesty's Govern. zaent made with the King of Prussia was that the great Powers of Europe on the one part should admit the existence of the rights which he claimed, while he -entered into an engagement not to disturb the peace of :Europe by any attempt to enforce those rights, but to placelsimsclf ini the hands of the great Powers, and to leave them to settle the question. I cannot conceive an arrangem~ent, not only more harmless in itself as involving no ulterior consequences, buat more likely to attain, first, the immae4aiato preservation of the peace of Europe, Iand, next, the ultimate settlemenit of this question. I do not blamie the Government which have succeededI for -not having taken any steps to come to a solution of this matter. I think, indeed, ,when they were dealing with the affairs of other countries at a conaference it wouldl not have been unreasonable to take this into consideration among other catuses which were likely to disturb the peace of Europe. (Hlear, hear.) They did not do so, and somne misguided men, mnisguided in their loyalty, rose for the purpose of enforcing the rights of the Prince of N~euchAltel. They were immediately puit dawn by the determined spirit of the Swiss people, and their acts were not unnaturally treated by the Swisis Confederation as acts of hostility to their Government. Under these circuinstances the King of Prussia threatenedI to enforce his rights unless these persona were at once dismissed without punishment, and, indeed, without trial. To have done this -without any further undlerstandinig would have been for the Swiss Confederation to maak-e an admission which it was im-possible for them to make (hear), and consequently tae only step was to have recourse to the mediation of the other P'owers of Europe. Accordling to diplomatic etiquette I believe it would have been right that Engiand, having been the Power bwhose mnediation the protocol of 18o2 was signed, should hlave taken the initiative on this oecasion, and thata, conference should have been held at London. Buat the King of Prussia, it appears, had placed himself unreservedly in the hands of the Emnperor of the French, and a proposition was made by His Majesty to the Swiss 'Confederation, which was ultimately acceded to by them. For myself, I have gathered a very distinct impression that Switzerland was on the paint of accepting the inediation, or rather the settlement, offered on the part of France, when the representations made to her by the British Governm~ent induced her to change her intention. And if I am correct in the assumption-and I must adhere to it until it is contradicted-that the Swiss are encouraged in standing ouat and hin refusing the arbitration of France by Her Majesty's :Ministers, I must say that, although I mnay rejoice that endeavours are being made by our Governmaent, in concert with our august ally, to bring about a settlement of the matters in dispute, 3s ct I cannot help feeling that if our Government had not interfered with the efforts of our
auutallY this vexed question would have been much earda sted. (Hear, hear.) There is another point which I trust is on the eve of satisfactory solution;- I mean our differences with thle'United States in regard to ,Central Arnerica. Beyond the honourable engage3ments that we 'have undertaken - towards certainx Indiani tribes we have few interests peculiarly our -own to maintain in that quarter of the globe. It is, however a attr o imortnceto grat commercial people lik ths, nd lsoto he orl atlare,that the neutrality of th lin of ommuncatin ac osth Isthimus of Panama sholdbe aihfllyprseved Or nlyinerst n ha
our commerce, and I shall view any sacrifice of the islands and territory which we may make in that region- provided they are intrusted to a Power adequate to prevent them from becoming the resort of lawless and disreputable characters, but still not adequate to exercise a controlling influence there to the prejudice of our interests-as fully compensated for by the attainment o)f tVe other objects involved in such a general arrangement. But I wish to know in what position we shall stand in the possible, though pei-haps not very probable, event of the Senate of the United States refusing to ratify thetreaty. In that case sball we not have surrendered Ruatan and the adjacenbt trritory, without securing a guarantee on the part of the United States for the neutrality of the passage across the isthmus? I hope we shal he told that the two engagements stand and fal
together-that we sball n',t be bound by the one treaty without having the equivalent advantage of the other-that the two will, in fact, form part of one general arrangement, to the whole of which the United States will be equally pledged with ourselves. (Hear hear.) Let me turn now
ora moment to the other topihe of difficulty which crowd upon us in this Speech, and which I am afraid will continue to crowd upon us ais long as9 the noble viscount (Palmerston) remains at the head of our affairs; Mbeause, admitting, as I do, the extraordiniary atdrotesWith which the noble viscount comnes out of the AMiemmX$ in which he place our foreign policy, I cannot
help imagining that this veryfaculty of adroitnesatin gettign out of difficulties tempta its possessor to launch us inito the -worst complications as frequently as posssible, inL order that hie mnay have miore opportunities for the exercise of his xnatchless skill in extricating the country from them again.
(Luhte. Whether the noble viscounat ia att the head of urfrinajffairs or at the head of our Governmaent, we Ze becoing perpetually embroiled, first with one Power, and then with Another--not, indeed, thaLt his system lands us in great wax., bgt i4 Wbat are termed diplpgiStg O tif3-

Are we quite mure, umy Lords,: that our. own conduct on all occasions has been perfectly ttraightforward (hear, Eear),-can we isay that we ' have held the. 'jams language to different natSons, orithatwe have kept the spirit as Wel Is the letter of the. promises avebavemadeind the es tations we have excited9 Are 've quite certain that We bave n'ot obtainedvalu-bleaupport from a wafilke and, if not a povwerful,at all evens4Sa brave and noble. ofople, by encouraging them 'to expect our intor. ference, if not by action, at least by isnral persuasion, for the improvement of their position in relation to the other States of Italy? HAve we not given them ground to look for our active aid in relievingthem from acontinual menace hanging over their heads, in securing their independence, and in enabling them to redress those expenses whic4press so heavily on their finances? Are we quite surc that after
we had reaped the advantage of their co-operation' we made a return to them at the final close of the Paris Conferences, in the shape of' such an amount of assistance and material support as our words and acts had led them to calculate upon? My
ords, I greatly doubt it. (Hear, hear.) Ihavenotforgotten the language of the Sardinian Commissioner when he referred, and referred in terms of some -bitterness, to the hopes which his country had conceived, and which it had been induced to cherish, from tho conduct ofttlib British Government. I have notforgotten the evasive'answor (I usethe word in no offensive, sense) which the stobleearl opposite. after an interval of aix short weekss, *as compelled to give in reply to the remonstrance of: the Sardinian Mimster. It is true, myLords, that Iffthe Paris Con. ferences we kept the word of promise to tbo ear,liut broke it to the hope. We introduced some vaguiusmueaning words abouttho foreign occupation of the, apal Statesbeing an "abnormal state of things" and' a serrous evil.: We pledged ourselves to those 'illUusoir words, but did we take the slightest step, or press our ally Francetotakethe slightest step, towards puttinrg an end to this serious and abnormal state of affairs 7I am iellxawarethat Austria objected to the introduc4on intd' the conferences of any matters alien to their imm'ediate object. And I ask, has Austria no'Vreason for entertaining diminished confidence in us-'in consequence of the equivocal course we have pursued? I have always thought that, while it iwas no partof our business either to interfere between 4sitria and her Italian subjects, or to seek to disturb hefin her possessions, at the same time it was not for
us to -go out of 'cosr way to strengthen her position in' the Italian 'pepinsula. On the contrary, a rigid good faith requires us X 'abstainfrom all linds of suchintermseddling; but I ask slie noble earl opposito whether Austria has not Tb the acts' of her alles, in the course of these negotiations, obtained a greater secUSity than ever for the maintenance of herItalian territories ? I greatly doubt whether the noble earl can answer that question in the negative. But, my Lords, what did we do ? Abstaining from, entering into such arranrements as might satisfy the just expectatiots of Psediaont, we yet embarked into a policy 'of interference with the internAl government of the Idngdom of the two Sicilies,. based on the pretext of a re-
ard for the peace of Euurope. What had the statea of the
gdomof she tWo Sicilies to do with the peace of Lturoea? SFYoi say, indeed, that the condition of Natles
d to disturb the general tranquilht,r which ad just been restored. Butdwill the noble earlriseuponthe part of the Government and gravely tell this assembly that Her Majesty's Ministers had the slightest apprehension that the course of conduct adopted bv the King of Naples towards his own subjects would occasion the smallest chance of any disturbance of the pease of Europoe? (lear, hear.) It is all very well to talk of the danger of Austrian interference and of the danger of French interference, but the noble earl knows that there was nothing to fear from any conDict of opinion between France and Austria on this point. The plea of any such danger was a mere plea, without any substance in it. Your interference with Napleawas partly dic'ated by a sense of the necessity for adhering to the de. clarations yoi had previously made, and by that nischievous spirit of meddling to which the noble vscount at the head of the Government is so strongly addicted. But what wero your demands upon the King of Naples ? If you 'are' on amicable and intimate terms with any Sovereign you might no doubt take the liberty to represent to him in a friendly manner that he is not pursuing a system of internal administration in his owIn dondnions which yon think calculated to idvance, his own interests. But were our relations with Naples based upon so close and equal a footing as to justify such an interference ?. Observe, my lords, that I am not supporting the tyrannical measures of the King's Governnent; I am not defending him - I am not defending the state of things at-Naples or in the f?apal States, made infinitely worse in the latter'case bv the occupation of foreign 'troops; neither doIlookwith satisfaction upon the position of constittutional government in Spain. 'But what have -we to do with Spain? what have we to do with Iome ? or with Naples ? (H ear, hear.) If English subjects suffer from the acts of any of these States, you are indeed bound to interfere and defend them; but, as between a' Soverefgn and his own subjects, I iAy that, according to'every principle of international law, remon. strance is going to the utmost limit to which you have a right to' go, and the breaking off'of friendly rela. tions because a monarch refuses to accept your advice as to the managenment of his kingdom cannot be defended byanypersons in the slightest degree acquainted with the principles of international law. On what ground, then, did you witharaw your Ambassadors ? I am not to be told that, in attacking this policy, I am attacking that of the 'Emperor of the French. I have the profoundest respect for the'Emperor of the French *-I esaly adnmire the scrupulous fidelity *ith which he has observedhis engagements with this country, and for the desire he has uniformly shown to maintain inviolate the friendly2elations between the 'tvo nations. (Hear, hear.) I am not going too far even when I say that at this moment he is, perhaps, the only firm friend you have in Earope ("Hear," and a laugh); but I think the Em peror of the French, acting as hO does in concert with the Government of this country, is very likely to fail into error, and that he has done so in this case. What have you done? You makc a demand upon the King of Naples. He answers in a manner which you may, if you choose, consider offensive; but he only bids you to attend to your own busin"ss. (A'laugh.) Whereupon you say, "If you don't mean to govr.n your country as we wish it to be governed, and to follow our advice in a matter in which we have ne earthly excuse for tendering advice, we will withdraw our ministers." Now, on this subject, just recollect the language which for weeks and months was hold by that portion of the press which is supposed to receive some inspiration from the noble viscount at the head of Her Majesty's Government, and that it does so the noble earl opposite (Earl of Clarendon) wi hardly venture explicitly to deny. Was there any term of vituperation not used in connexion with the King of Naples ? We were told that the British flee' was to sail, that it required nothing but the sight of our fleet to make the people of Naples and of Sicily revolt, that the King would thereupon become a fugitive upon the face of the earth, and that then-God knows what was to happen. And yet the Royal Speech now refers to the " friendly com. inunications" held with the King, and expresses great surprise thatlisMajesty refused to take the advice tendered to him, in consequence of which England and France with. drew their ambassadors. And what was the re ly of the King of Naples to that? He merely said to thle ambas sadors, " I wish you good morning, gentlemen !" (A laugh.) Thus, two of the greatest nations in Europe threaten to withdraw their missions as a menace, and in return the ambassadors are quietly told that they may walk down stairs. The ambassadors submit to that indignity; they go away without the slightest excitement on the pat of any numan being; no additional precautions are tak-en by the Neapolitan Government; a miserable attempt at insurrection in Siciyis put down in an instant; a wretched attempt at assassination ends in the execution of the criminal; and that is the whole result of your interference, except that, at the hands of a power like Naples, the Governments of England and France have received a well-deserved affront. (Hear, hear.l I think, then, that the interference of Her Majesty's Ministers at Naples was unworthy of the policy of this country, and I think that the result
is an undignified conclusion to an unjust attack. (Cheers.) My lords, I regret that the topics upon which I am obliged to touch are so numerous, but I am compelled to follow, to a certain extent, each of the subjects upon which Her Majesty invites us to pronounce an opinion or to caU for explanation. Passing to another point, I confess that I see with deep regret the two petty wars in which we now appear to be involved. I regret the state of our relations with Persia; I look with even more regret, and with even greater doubt as to the justification of our cause, upon what has taken Place in China. (Hear, hear.) Assuming, as undoubtedly I do assume, that the independence of Herat, or rather the non-occupation of Herat by Persia (if Persia is to be considered as a country In a state of dependence upon Russia) is not a subject of indifference to this country, I am certainly not prepared to defend the tortuous and devious policy pursued by that State with reference to HIerat. In 1852-I, or rather
mnoble friend (thxe Earl of Malmesbury), had occasion to express ourselves pretty strongly tosthe Court of Teheran and -we received in return from the Shah the most solemn assurances-assurances which were not adhered to-that no attempt should be made upon Herat. Thereupon we felt it necessary, in consequence of the falsehood-I will use n
o the wodofteere senhtahtions made by Persia,to suspend reient here. At the same time, however, we did not on mhat account relax ouar efforts to carry out ou- obet-n
anid the Russian Minister co-operating coardiay wit ourssin, Persia, we did O'btain in 1852 the abanadonment of Herat by the Persians ; and in 1853 an agreement was entered into between the Shah and Colonel Shiel, of which we know nothing except from the pub lie papers; hut which, judging fro.'what has there appeared, dLoes nlot seem. to have been very skilfully drawn up or expressed. Of what has passed between this country and Persia since that time I know very little, at least from official sources, because the articles of agreement to which I have alluded have never been laid before Parliament. (Hlear, hear.) But, as I understand, in t-hat agreement Persia undertook to make no attack uponHerat, while we undertook, should thera be any such attack on the part of any other Power, to use moral persuasion in order to prevent the conquest of this city. .Now, if I am rightly informed, there nxever was any Persian attack on Herat tintil the beginning of the year 1855, at which time our -new ally and old enemy, D)ost Mahomaed, advanced an Affghan army to Candahar. The ruler of Herat for the time was apprehensive that Dost Alahomed was meditating amarch on orat, and had he meditated suchamarch itwould have justifed theinterferenceofPersia. Inthe belief of a cominug Affghau attack the ruler of Herat himself called for the interference of Persia to defend him ; but asthe Perm cians c-ame a little nearer than he thovght qeita desirable lhe suddenly turned round and asked the Affgbau to defena him. against the Persiang. In the conflict 'which ensued the Affghans wereasignally defeatedhby the Persians, who having in theo first instance advanced, as I have said, at the request of the Governor of Herat, made themselves mast.ets of the

Do you even possess those powers over your own subjects which a state of war gives ? Can you restraini Engihsh merchants from exporting powder and Arms to Persia, as you could have done if a proclamation of war had issued ? I am not lawyer enough to answer these questions, but they have been raised and must bo dealt with ; and at a
-events you do not avoid your constitutional responsibility for having engaged in a war without applyinzfor the consent of Parliament, becanse you have omitted the usual form of proolamation. The-warisonenot forIndian, butfor British purposes. It ought, therefore, to have been communicated at the first possible moment to Parliament, and if Parliament is to maintaint that control which it has hitherto exercised over the advisersof the Crown-if Parlinmebt is not prepared to abandon its right of being conulteduponmueacures which mayimpose heavyburdens upon the peopie-if you ari not to set aside as obsolete and of no value the traditions and practices of a century and a-half of Parliamentary government-I say Her Majestyls Govern3ment, by the course they are pursuing, have justly incurred the censure of Parliament; and you cannot pass by these proceedings without some sorious notice, unless you are prepared to give up the high position voi have heretofore
beld thouse State, and to lower the dignity and authority ofthis House. ft is with these views that I am now about to mbve an amendment to the Address. I do not, strong ad my opinion is with respect to the impolicy and iniustice of the wrar, ask 'you to condemn it. I r think that as a fitting mark- of respect to the Crown we should abstain from pronouncing any opinion upon the policy of the war until the papers have been laid before us; but, while I do not ask you to condemn the war, I cannot cmnsent to words which by implication approve it. I therefore call uprn the House simply to express its sorrow at the breaking out of hostilities with Persia; but J also convoy in my amendment, though in terms of the utmost moderation and of the greatest respect to Her Majesty, that censure upon the proceedings of the Government which I tbink is due to our character- afid to the authority of Parliament. I propose to substitute for the paragraphs Telating to the Persian war,- the following aragraph -
"Hu nbly to inform'Her Majesty that, while we deeply deplore the occurrence of circumstances which have led to hostiiities between Her Majesty and the Shah of Persia, we also feel it to be our duty very respectfully to express our regret that when Her Majesty's servints advised Her Majesty to give orders'for the invasionof PersiabyaBritish force they did not at the same time advise Her Majesty to call hor Parliament together, so that Parliament might have learnt'without delay that the nation was about to be involved in war, and might have had an opyortunity of humbly snbmitting to Her Majesty any advice it might have judged such an occasion to require."
I have framed and produced this amendment without comns municating with any one member of your lordships' House. I know no' whether I-shall or shall not receie an Su .rt I shill not be disappointed if all support isu ithheldfrom mE i bat I have so strong a sense of the inexpedr'ency of passing the Address in the shapo in which it has been moved tlat ovsr painftl it may be to stand alone, I think, I am but disShargingh an imporhant and imperative duty in proposig the amrendment wrhich I have read to your lordships. aHear, hear.)
nEarl GRANV dLeatE.Adotwithstanding the statement made by the noble earl of the obligation under which he findB himself to move an amend ment upon the present occasion, I poannot help thinking that he wonld have done 'well if be hiad listened 'to the appeal of the noble earl who moved the Address in a manner rhich gave promise of his beig an otnament to this whose, supported as it ras by the noble earl who seconded the Address, and by the high auithority of the noble earl opposite, who pointed ort the advantages of the system pursued for some years in both Houses of Parliament of not going too deeply. into the questions touched upon in the Speech from the Throne. It appears to me that wvhen we enter too minutely into these questions without having had an opportunity of reading the papers which will be laid before Parliament, we are led into conversations which it would be much better to avoid-namely, statements on facts which can only be contradicted by those who are in posession of papers which have not yet been submitted to your lordships. Following the noble earl over the different points urged by him, I will begin with the casus belli with Persia. The noble earl thinks that the whole casu3 belli dopends upon a certain engagement made by the Shah, and he argues that the mere breach of that engagement, even if it could. be proved, does not constitate a casus beE. N'ow, I believe that whenever, ander ordinary circumstances, one Power makes an engagement with another, the violation of it constitutesin itself a Casus belli. It may become a question of policy whether military measures should be consequent upon such a breach or not; but peir se a deliberate violation of engagement constitutes an absolute right of war. But I hold' that without this engagement at all there would have been a reasonable ground for a military demonstration on our part to prevent schemes which we thought dangerous to our Indian empire; and if the noble earl had shown less impatience, and waited for the papers Which will be immediately laid before your lordships, he would have found that not only the present Government, but also the Government of the noble earl opposite, most clearly intimated to the Shah the possible occurrence of an expedition to the Island of Karrack in case he persevered in his designs against Herat. The noble earl next strongly objected to the character of the engagement entered into with Persia; he said it 'was an engagement perfectly inconsistent with any which it would be possible to make in Europe. It appears to me that the noble earl is quite wrong in this respect;.' Are there no engagements entered into in Europe to prevent aggressions nupon other Powers ? Why, Europa swarms with them. One of the most approved acts of the noble earl behind me was the guarantee given to Sweden during the Russian war by England and France protecting her against invasion. That guarantee, however it might be disapproved by the noble earl was received with great plea sure in this country, the concausive proof of which was that not the slightest objection was taken to it in either House of rarliament. The noble earl argued the whole of this point on abstract grounds, withcut reference to the actual facts of the case. But the common-sense view of the question-taken, he was glad to remark, by the noble earl opposite-is that, whatever may be the desire of the Russian Government now, it was natural that during the war, anxious to make au impression both upon our finances and our arms, they should encourage Persia to take that opportunity of aecomplishin what it had so long attempted in vain. (Hear, hear) The noble earl stated the reason why, in his opinion, it was a mere bugbear to talk of a Russian expedition being really d r,gerous to our Indian dominions. htow, s,Uy Lords, I, for one, am not inclined to attach any exaggerated importance to the probability of the Russian Government making for. mi hable espeditions of an aggressive character a long way from their own dominions. I believethatat thepresent moment-and I am more justified than most other persons in saying this-it is not the intention of the Russian Government to take any such steps, and that their anxious desire is that this matter should be arranged as speedily as possible. But this does not affectthe question of futurecontingencies. (Hear.) The noble earl adverted to the facilities that Russia has for intimidating and influencinz others, but added that outr real danger in India was not the conflict of arms, but the weakness of finance. Now, Herat is considered by all a place of the greatest importance, and, indeed, the possession of that place is regarded, as a acne qua non to any attack upon lndia.. Supposing, then, the case of Russia using that influence vwbich the noble earl attributes to her, of intimidation and influence in such a place as Herat, I ask whether means could not be devised without resorting to a warlike expedition to foment quarrels and create alarnms that would lead to a heavy depression in the financial resources of India. (Hear, hear.) The noble lord charges the Governnent of England With inconsistency in this respect, and he quoted Wellesley as an example of this; but is it fair to quote cases in contradistinction to the present without niaking tho slightest alludons to the change of circumstances (Hear, bear.) I do not think it applies in the slightest deree to the present case that becauseLord Welle.leythought it right to adoot a certain polic in his day the present Government shall not, if thev should have distrust of Russia, take care to prevent. possible danger in that
quarser. (Hneir he. -T-he -n-o'b-l-elo'rd 'p~r~oceede'd to-p-oin"t out with great rore the injustice of tho undertaking on which we have entered; but there is hardly any war, even the most Just and necessary, except in the case of actual invasion, that can -be traced to the necessity of selfdefence. (Hear.) If we were right in assuming danger either of a direct or indirect character to our Imudian possesSions from the possession of Herat by another .Jower, that does constitute a case of self-defence. (Hear, heat&). The noble earl says wve are the aggressrs., 1.itterly deny that. It is the Persians who are the aggressors, stimulated by a Power who had the desire at the tmie to create a disturbance in its favour, and notwithstanding the engagement Persis had entered into not to molest us during -the war In which we -were etgaged. (Hear.) The noble earl complains of there being no proclamation of war in this country ; hut if the noble earl 'will refer to other wars that have tal-en place-some of them when he was a memnber of tho Cabinet-he wi Ifind that for a period of 30 or 40 years there has been no sach proclamation of war by the Home Government. Take the case of the Affghan war, or even the war with China, and he will find that no proclamations were issued by the Homo Government. I believe the. best. ay.thorities do not admit that a proclamation is necessary at all-that it is only caTled for with regard to ulterior effects on neutrals, it being considered only fair, if you are likely to inflict indirect iniury
on neutrals,.that you should give them notice. (Hear.) I . think we are right in following the.usual preedent on

Lord BROUGHAM thought it would be convenient to 'abstain from disbussing the Persian war, as 'tho papers on that isbleotwere promised in the Royal Speech and would ehortly he laid upon the table. .He hoped it would not be fond, whon the Eastern hostilities were moro closely con'sidered, that ouragents-ana especiallythose in Chinam-bad 'been pickinga quarrel for the sake of obtiing an sdvantage: With regard to the affais of Naples, he was one of those vwho thought that England had neither done too much -nor too little. He was glad that' Her Majestys' Government had not gone futther, and ' he' mnst protest against what appeared to hbe a too generally prevailing notion .out of doors, that it was the Tocation of .this country-.to intermeddle in the affairs of. foreign 'Powers for thepurpose of redressing the grievances of sub-
jects of foreign princes, of restraining'the cond'1ctof those' princes, and. of :propa~tting constitutional government 'al over the woridi' mngllshmen might lament that :other countries 'did not enjoy the incalculable bonefits of constional government, and they might lament, 'also, that other nations were ruled by princes Who were capable of acts which O one abhorred more than 'himself, Such princes might grant amnestios, but whether those amniesties were voluntarily accorded or were extorted 'signified little with regard to future security so long as the unhappy subjects of these princes did not enjoy :the blessings of constitutional government. Ho was by no meains convinced that this coantry had a right to -remonstrate in such ecses, but certainly thoy had no right 'to go ono single haib breadth beyond remonstrance for the purpose of enconrag-ing nationg to obtnin bettr institutions, or of controlling sovereigns who acted under such institutions as at present unfortunately existed. le remembered the time when a neighbonring nation 'deemed it their vocation to plant republics all around them, and thereby involved Europe in a general war; and England had no more right to plant parliamenthry governments al over Europe than France had in November, 1792, to surround herself with 'republics. The Royal Speech which had been read seemed to be framed on the principle enforced in Kew Gardens-to look at everything and touch nothing. He had been strnck by the generalty of the passape respecting the estimates, which was couched in precisely the same words that had been adopted in almost every Royal Speech' he had seen. Great excitement prevailed throughout the country on the subject of the income-tax. He had done his duty in opposing that tax, and in 1842 he moved a set of resolutions, condeming it in every point of view, and declaring the necessity-sf it should be adopted at all-of modifying it in such a manner as to make a distinction between income derived from capital and income-derived from professions, and between income derived from capital for life. and income derived from capital in trade. The great satesman' whose.oss they daily deplored, and his noble friend who was then at the head of the Board of Trade, distinctly confessed that they had not a word to say in reply to his resolutions, and the arguments adduced in their support; and the illustrious duke who then occupied so distinguished a position in tho country expressed his opinion that the tax ought not to continue for one hour afterpeace had been concluded. Itmight be said the necessity for the tax had not yet ceased; but he remembered that, in 1816, when he waged war against the impost, the estimates were brought down to the House framed in the usual way, the King's speech baving promised the utmost economy consistent 'with the effliciency of the publiec service. - After six weeks campaign, the income-tax was reduced by 14,OO,000. or la. vw,OOOI., and the Chancellor of the Exchequer abandoned the war malt tax of some 3,OO,0001. A sum of 18,000,0001. was thus *ithdrawfi from the sup pl, and the Chancelor of the Exchequer prepared an amended set of estimates, framedon the principle of cutting his coat according to his eloth. He (Lord Brougham) hopI that in the present instance a diminution of the amount of income-tax would lead to a corresponding reduction in the estimates. He was aware that the noble Secretary for War had already effected a considerable reduction in the expenditure, but he hoped that the diminution of the income-tax would occasion still further retrenchment. Nothing gave him greater satisfaction, however, than the promises of the Government with respect to measures for the improvement of the law, and he felt bound to say that he had ever confidence that these promises would be performed. Never was there a time when such reforms were more needed in all branches of the law. Without entering now into a discussion on the ticket-of-leave question, he would say that some chango orothermust take placein the modo of dealing with prisoners. This he took as being absolutely clear, and the result of actual experience. It was noteasy to say what thatchange should be, buta considerable increase in thenumber of ourpolice-officers, hobelieved,would be absolutely necessary. Bo had lately had the honour of presiding over a conference of delegates from all the great mercantile towns, at which certain changes in the mercantile law were discussed. These mereantile men had had more opportunities than any other for estimating the disadvantages of the present law, and he hoped their lordships would give a favourable ear to their representations.
The LORD CHANCELLOR said that, as the paragraph in the Royal Speech with regard to law reform was rather vague, it would probably be acceptable to their lordships if he intimated to them more in detail what measures it was the intention of the Government to introduce. The first subject to which the Government had directed their attentien was the reform of the ecclesiastical courts-a& subject of tho greatest importance, and one which, singularly enough, had been undertalken without success by every Government during the last 25 years. On that day -week he should ask their lordships' leave to introduce three bills-one for the reform of testamentary jurisdiction, another to amend the laws of marriage and divorce, and a third on the subject of church discipline. The Attorney-General would also, as soon as possible, ask for leave to introduce into the other House a bill to render criminal breaches of trnst, of which there had unfortunately been so many instances of late. Some time ago, it would be in the recollection of their lordships, a commission was issued to inquire into the subject of the regtration of lands; that commission had not yet reported, though le had reason to know that it had prepared the draughts of two bills to be laid before Parliamenton the subject. Inthemoeantimeit was his intention to -ask the Legislature toefl'ectaminor reform in tTiesame direction, to render extremely simple mortgages of land by mceans of registration.' Theirlordsip were awfare that there was at work at the present ' mrment a commission for the consolidation of the statute law; nobody unacquainted with the subject could comprehend half the difficulties which beset it, ut thecommission had succeeded in consolidating the vhole criminal law, and bills similar to those which he had laid on the table on the last day of the previous session would be ntroduced for the purpose of effecting that consolidation. He should also ask-their lordships to refer the second report of that commission to a select committee, in order to consider the prorosition in that report forthe adoption of means to improve the manner and langusage of current legislation. The member w ho introduced a bilwals generally so glad to have it passedtbat he consented without difficulty to any alteration that wsas proposed in' it; and the result was that,
wuen the measure became law, its various provisions ware found not to dovetail together. Moreover, the language of tbe statutes was frequently discrepant, leading to uncertainty as to its meaning; What the Government, therefore, proposed was, that there should be an officer appointed,who should be a very able lawyer, and whose duties would be to report, when called upon, on every bill introduced for the alteration of the law; to explain exactly what its effect was, what was its bearing on the existing law, and generaUy to put the whole statute in order. And 'further, aftera bill lhad gone through committee, the House 'should refer it, if it thought fit, to this officer to examine and state the alterations it had undergone in pasing that ordeal, and also to point out how far those alterations affected its general tenor. of *ourse, this officer wbnld have it in his power to offer suggestions for improving the languago of an act ; and it wasto'bo hoped that tho result would be torender our statutes more clear, less verbose, and more in hi'rmony with the common feelingms and nnderstandints of maukind. Another -part of the same offlooes duties would be to clasify the various acts passed within the year. His functions would, of course, be at first extremely tentative; but, no doubt, as they became gradually more defined, they would prove highly useful.' Before concluding it was right 1seotA mention that his right hon. friend the Home Secre, tary intended to introduce a measure into the other House on the subject to which a: noble lord, had alluded-namelyt that of secondary punishments.

Pereia thought that she was subjected to more danger from the hostility of Russia than she conld be from the hostility of England, and, she consequently took no great pains to disguise her unfiendly feelings towardsthis,countis. I will not go into that miserable* busisiegs wh.ch appears to have been the immediate cause of Mr. Murray's retirement from Teheran becauseO that was only one of the petty affronts which Persia thought she might safely offer to the representative of this country. But I think it exceedingly natural that Russia, being at that time at war with us, should stimulate Persia to take the step the did, and should endeavour to Enlm e a n gland. I nm also persuaded, my lords, that it is resen momentthesncere desire of Russia n to be mvolved in another war with this country (hear, hear), but to maintaij faiendly relations with her; and that with that view she is at the present momwet exercising her whole influence to izduce Persia to comply with your desires and to act in:the manner whichyot require. Let me take the liberty ofsayang that I thinks it woould be for the benefit of England. and Rnssia,notonly'nowbutforalltime, that the two'coin-' tries, Affghanistan and Persia, should form an interval between their respective territories * and that it is an object to be aimed at by every statesman who talks of resistin tlio encroachments of Russia. to maintain between Indn
and Russia the largest possible space of independent
territory, and thus to prevent any contact betweeni the two I countries, and at the same tine to prevent the dhance of a collision. I believe that Russia herself is deeply impressed with that trath, and that although she stimulated Persia when she herself was your enemy to resist your wahes, yet at the present moment, when that is no longer the case, she is mincing efforts in a very different diiection. For my own part, with regard to a settlement withlPersia, I believe more in the efficacy of the representations of Russia than I do in the expedition to the Persian Gulf.. I say nothing gaTinst the valour, the zeal, and the promptitude displayed by that small expeditionary force. On the contrary, the signal manmer in which it has succeeded ieflects the hghest credit upon the Indian(Government, and it must be satisfactory to my noble and gallant friend near rne (the Earl of Hardwicke) to reflect that AdmirAl Sir Hz Leeke was one of that unfortunate class who, upon accouait of it being supposed that their age was not adapted for active service were compelled to retire. Sir I. Leeke, then, enterea the Indian service, and it must be satisfactory to my noble friend to see-to have seen it shown-that the step to which I have referred deprived England of some of her best admirals, and that among those officers who were conipelled to retire were many who were capable of good and meritorious service. (Hear, hear.) I heard with dismay, and I heard with satisFaction, first, of the advance of troops on Cabul, and then of their retrograde movement. [The Earl of Clarendon was understood to deny that such a movement had taken place.] Well, then, perbaps when the papers
wluhhavereen promised to us are laid upon the table tley wil throw some light upon the subject, and I wiU no'w orly say that I should view with great anxiety any advance on that side. There is another point of importance in a con. atitational point of view, and that is the authority by which the war with Persia was began. I have seen theproclamation of the Governor-General of India, by which he declares war against Persia, but I have yet to learn thlat the Governor-General of India has any constitutionad powver of prolaiming war on the part of this country. I have Mtherto alvays understood that the proclamation of war was part of the prerogative of the Crown, and that war mutt be declared by the Crown with certain formalities. I't in this instance it had bWoe intended to declare war it would have been the duty of thoe.Government to caU Parliam9nt together, and to make them acquainted with the reasoh for such a proceeding. I quite - understand that wars ir; India, tndertaken for Indian objects against native princes, stand upon a different footing. But in the present case British troops are spoken of and the whole affair is treated as a British and not an Indian war. -It is a war entered into by direction of the home Government, and is clearly a
British war, and, if so, -it ought to have Ibeen declared by a I British Sovereign and brought before Parliamen'. (Hear, hear.) I know not wha,t-answer my noble-friend opposite may make, I presume thPat he has consulted the authorities of the Crown on the subject, but my own impressionis, that as the war is an unfortunate one, so the proclamation of it has been unconstitutional, nay, ilmost illegal. tHear; hear.) But if I deplore the commencement of the Persian, ten times more do I deplore the 'opening of the Chinese war 5Jheers), accompanied as it has been by Proceedings unknown an civilized warfare (hear, hear), but wich I have to-night heard with astonishment characterized as being marked with geat forbearance. (Hear, hear.) I do not say that the C inese have not violated the treaty into which they entered, but what I do say is, that I consider it extremely doubtful whether the lorc a Arrow was under the rotection of the flag of this country, and, if not, our whole case falls to the ground. Sir T. Bowning admits that the time for which the Arrow was entitled to carry the British flag had expired; but, he adds, that the Chinese did not know that such was the case. He also states, that under the colonial re,eister she was entitled to carry the British flag until her return to Hongkong. Now, I Wery much' doubt the legal valdity of the colonial register, and of this I am sure, that there is infinite danger in allowing any authority at a distance to grant British protection, and to enable persons, whatever their character may be, to advance a claim to British influence. I believe, however, that the colonial register is of very doubtful validity, because I think that it is inconsistent with, aAnd repugnant to, the law of England, and it is clearly laid down that colonial law shall not be repugnant to the law of the parent State. I believe that this colonial register confers the privileges of British vessels upon vessels which are not The property of lritish subjects, but -of persons, who, bemg foreigners, have been allowed, on the 2payment of large sums of money, to: take leases of laud in Hongkong, thereby becoming resident in that colony, but who do not thereby become British subjects, and who cannot by the generai mercantile law claim for their vessel the protection of the British Ilag. But, my lords, xdmitting even the legal validity of the colonial register-supposing even that the Chinese had been ten times more in the wrong-suppose the insult had been more grave and had even been repeated, I sy that the course taken by our representative is ona which I had expected to have' eard censured and not vindicated. The Arrow was in Chinese waters, aIthough I know I may be told that the po;wer of the consul extends over those waters. There was a man on board that vessel chargeable-and, I believe, fairly so-with the commission of acts of piracy; that man was arrested, and also the remainder of the crew. On the demand of the consul, however, the Chinese offered to restore the crew, retaining the man. Now, I say that in this case, whatevr may have been the inadequacy of the reparation, it was a case in which the British representative ought to have received the men, although he might express disapDrobation at the proceedings, and, at the same time, apply it his Government for instructions. Instead of adoptig that course, he takes upon himself to enter upon hostilities of the most acrid character. He destroys their forts, but he goes still further in that course of forbearance so much lauded by the Government. (A laugh.) In time of peace, that is to say with no war legaDly proclaimed, without, I believe, giving any notice of his intention, upon his own authority, w;ithout the sanction of the Crown he orders the admiral on that station to dowhat ? You took great credit for sparing Odessa. (Loud cries of H Hear, hear.") You were told that Odessa was faU of food and military stores; you were at war with a mighty empire; this country was taxed to the utmost; but you said that, on grounds of humanity, you would not destroy a commercial town. But now in the time of peace, without the sanction of the Crown, the British representative takes upon himself, not only to destroy forts, but to bombard a peaceful commercial town with an indiscriminate slaughter of unoffending citizens-(hear, hear) -a town with which you have no relations but commercial relations, and the destruction of which can simply be fatal to your own commercial interests. And we are told that such a bombardment is an act of signal forbearauce I My lords, I look upon that transaction with pain, and with no expectation of the benefits which we are informed wiU result from it. At aU events, if such benefits do result it is probable that they hove been the real object from the first, and that you have gone to war on false pretences. (Hear, hear.) But I doubt whether you wil gain the anticipated advantages. I doubt whether the literal fulfilment of the Treaty of Pekin will tend to augment our trade with Canton, which has increased so largely within the lazt few years; and I doubt whether the best means for gaining admission into the interior of the country is the bombardment of a large town and the massacre of its unoffending inhabitants. (Hear, hear.) My lords, I have now gone through the topics which are adverted to in the Speech. It is not my intention, nor do I think that it is upon general grounds advisable, to move an amendment which might interfere with the unanimity with which. the lIouse would otherwise passa thc Address. WVhile I rejoice,
however, in the prosp&ilt of the country, wihich is aLnnounced in the Speech, and which, with some exceptions, I believe to be a correct representation of the case. I cannot but see in the foreign policy of this country, which I iegret to find occupies so large a space in the Speech, another unfortunate repetition of that meddling spirit and uncalled for interference with foreign countries which has so often characterized the previous proceedings of the noble viscomt at the head of the Government, which cannot raise our character or procure us friends in foreign countries, and which will interfere by its perpetual disturbance of our commercial relations with that which I trust will long be the growing. and increasing prosperity of this great country. (Cheers.) sly lords, I cannot approve the course which has been pursued by the Government in its foreign policy; but I forbear from embodying the opinions which I have expressed in any amendment, because. I trust that they will be mnodilied by the papers which I presume Her Majesty's Government will shortly lay before Parliament. (Hear, hear.)
The Earl of CLARENDON.-.My lords, I cannot but express my regret that the noble earl opposite should so far have departed from the practice, which he eulogized, of abstaining from entering into a discussion of points brought forward in Her Majesty's Speech with regard to our foreign E:olicy, and tbat, in the absence of the informatidn which will shortly be laid before your lordships, he should have entered into such long and strong vituperatioli of Her Majesty Government. I think that the object of the noble earl would lavo been better served, that he would more clotely have adhered to that practice of Parliament which he praised, and that he would greatly have consulted te convenience of all your lordships if he had wraited nntil the papers in question were in your hands; for Iam sure it
popular movement might have been, but we desired no such movement. We wished a ehanu no4 of dynaty, but of asstemn, s:d wouldhavo bengld to pPoduce a better state of feeling bet*een 'the: King rand is subjects. The noblol earL thir4;, has rather undervalued the fimportaice ef what hag since ccurreL -As-for th'e amnesty,

(Hear.) Withrespebttothenegotiationsxwitithe United States and Hondur. I think 'the noble earl bas rather over-stated the difficulties whichmay lie in the wayeof a thorough settlement of the matters in dspute. There is no reason to dotbt that the qbjecti of the treaties into which we have entered will be realized, and that they will fulfi all those points to which the noble msrl bas directed your attention. Your lordahips will fnd that all those engagen;ents which we are bound in honour to maintain will be maintained, while all tho rights of territory which Hondus poseses will. be secured to that State. These two treaties re in no way connected with each other. The treaty with the United States has merely reference to the dispute that has arisen with respect to the protection of the lfosquto territory. With reference to Ruatan, which was supposed to belong to Honduras, we havo made that island ovor lin suci a way as that ilt shall be under the sovereignty of Honduras. There is now a proposal for the constraction of a railroad over these territories, anid this, I believe, wiUl be found to be the nght and practical mode of establishing a communication between the two oceans. On both sides of the Isthinus there are magnificent harbours and no doubt all the-Pomiers of the world who would avaii themselves of 'this mesns of communication would have taken exception toany arrangement by which an island, almost at the entrance to it, Ehould have been left in the hands of any one Power. It has been placed under the saeraintyofflonduras,withoutherhavi thepowerofing itup to anyother Government. (Hear.) believe, therefore, that these trextieswillbe found fullytoanswer thepurp6ses which the Governments of England and the United-States had in -vew, and that they will have the effect of proventing any future misunderstandings between the two countries on this question. (Hear, hear.) I will oni
further add on this point, that I agree with the noble ernl opposite that we have no interest whatever in Central Ame.rZic beyond that of possessig a free transit across the
Isthmus, and I cannot see any reason why upon that question there should in future arise any difficulty betwveen us and the United States. (Hear, hear.) Before I enter upon the question of the Persian war, I shall endeavour to givo some explanation as to the causes which led to the 16ralking off of diplomatic relations with that country, and at the same time exlress my satisfaction at what has been said by the noble ear with reference to the rupture which led to Xhe suspension of those relatiors. I would particuntrly ask your lordshipe to wait.a few days for the papers that will be lai on the table on this subject, and in the meantime to dismiss from your minds all that has been sd on the subject, more particulaily with reference to the supposed connexion of a lady with the matter. (Hear, hear.) That lady was the wife of a person who bad been long under the protection of the British mission-and s such aeknowledged by the Persian Government. An order came that that protectionshould be abandoned from his bitter and unrelenting enemy, the Prime Minister, and his wife waS taken to prison. Mr. MarTay most properly protested against theact.. It as ad. mitted that the man had a zight to protection, and yet they did not admit that this protection extended to his wife. Mr. Muray remonstrated against this arbitrarv conduct; but when I tell you that I have received from AMr. Murray the most solemn aurance, and that he has given it on his honour as a gentleman, that he was influenced by no improper motives in making that protest, your lordships will agree with mo that there is not the shadow of an imputation on his character. (Eeati, hear.) In the absence of that gentleman a servant of tho Crown who has been unjustly maligned, i feel it to be my duty to take this opportunity of vindicating his reputation from thIe asperstons that have been east upon it. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Murray was compelled to suspend his relations with Persia. Having received no explanation on the point he left Teheran, for had he remained he would have been in the p6stion of an* unproteeted man, liable to insult eveiy day. There would have been great excitemenit agiinst him, and he would in the end have been forced to abandon the place without having secured his object- that of reparation for the inuy ,which had been done. Mr. Murray very properly. thou gthtltatthe Qaeen's representative should not be exposea to the ignominy of such anaccunaulation of affronts as would have been cast upon him, and exercised the Vise discretion of leav ngTeheran; but I hope your lordships will bear in mind that this rapture was not the cause-of the war. (Hear hear ) II ertainly expected that time and reflection would have led Persia to remain on good terms with this country, especially when she considered howgreatly she has been indebted to us intimes past anddalsowlhen she know that we were no longer at war withlt6sia. Bat the ease assumed a different aspect when Persia exhibited a determination to get possession of Herat. (Eear.) On that subject we did not fail to make our representations to the Persian Government. Onthe 11th of July, 1856, I wrote a letter to the Sedr Azim, demanding reparation for the breach of engagements respecting Herat, and the withdrawal of the Persiau troops from that city. The following is the letter-
" Foreign-office, July 11, 1856..
The undersigned, &c, has the honour to recall to the recollectionoftheSedr Azimthearticlesofagreementrespet in Herat, which were concluded in the month of January, 183, between his Excellency and Lieutenant-Colonel Shiel, then Her Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister
Plenipotentiaryat the Court of the Shah. a i
" By those articles the Persian Government engaged not to send on any account troops to Herat, unless when foreign troops invaded Herat, that is (troops), from the direction of Cabul or Candahar, or other foreign country. In tho event, too, of troops being sent in that case the Persian Government engaged that the said troops were not to enter the city of Herat; and whenever the foreign troops returned towards their own territory the Persian troops were immodiately and without delay to return to the Persian soil. The Persian Government also engaged not to interfere in any way whatsoever in the internal affairs of Herat, such as in taking posession, or occupying, or assuming the sovereignty, or in governing, unless in so far as it interfered during thelifetime of Yar Mahommed lhan. The Persian Government also engaged to abandon the pretensions and demand£for the coinage and the Khtohek, or any other mark w;hatsoever of the people of Rrt en ujcso no the Government Of Persia. en ujcso ne
" The British Government have been informed that since the beginning of the present year Persian troops have'not only invaded the territory of Elerat, hut have lIdd siege to the city of Herat, and have interfered in the internal affairs of Herat, and that the movemnents of troops in different parts of Persia indicate a. determination on the part of the Persian Government to persist in its aggression on Herat, and in its disregard of solomr engagements contracted with the British Government.
'"Sech conducot on the part of Persia is considered by the British Government to constitute an act of open hostility against Great Britain - and the object of the undersigned in nowv addressing the ;sedr Asim is to make knowvn to the Persian Government that, unless reparation is promptly made by it for this breach of engagement and for thnis act of hostility, and unless the Persian troops are forthwith withdrawrn from the city and territory of Herat, the British Government will adopt such measures as a regard for its ovwn honour and its own interests may Prescribe; and wl hold itself absolved from any responsibility for the consequences of those measures, howrever disastrous to Persia they
u e ndersigned, &c."" ls-o
MIy Lords, to this letter I received a most unsatisfactory answer. It was, in fact, a. mere letter of pretenocs, not even alluding to the subject of HBerat, bast stating that the disagreement between the Persian Government and Mr. )Murray was merely a personal dispute, which might be arranged by the Persian Ambassador w^ho was about to proceed to Paris. Her Majesty's Government then thought it proper that a more detailed communication should be addressed to the Persian Government, and on the lOSh of October I addressed the following letter to the Persian AMinister for Foreign Atffairs:-
" The undersigned b c, had the honour to receive on the 20th of September the letter wvhich the Sedr Arim, Prime Mi&nister of His Majesty the Shah of Persia, addressed to him on the 17th of August, having reference to the letter which the unmdersigned addressed to the Sedr Arim on the 11th of July, on the subject of the proceedings of the Persian Government in regard to Herat, but containing no answer to that letter.
*"Hler MWajesty's Government had hoped that the letter of the undersigned wvould have elicited from the Persian. Governinent a distinct asrance that that Government would. at once desist from the enterprise which it had undertaken against HEerat, in vioLaton of solemn engagements entered into wth .the British Government in former times, and in defiance of the often-expressed determination of the British Government not to tolerate any interference on the part of Persia with the States of FAffghaniistan, and not to allowr the extension of the authority or the territory of Persia in that quarter. Her Majesty's Government had hoped that such
assurance would have ben given, and would have be~en `fl-0 lowd led to y th e immediatewithdrawaof the Persian armis fom ffgsn trriory an bycomplete reparatio fr te nsutswhih ad ee oferd to the British Govrnmntin he eron f te uee'sEnvoy, and which
"If all this had been done Her Majestq's Government 'would have been enabled to re place, on a friendly footing, its relations with the Court of the Shah.
"Her Majestys Governm en t have been disppointed in these hopes and expectations.

Every Government of this country has felt the importane tbe protecting th erat. That city is situated upon the immediate confines of Perbia, in a plain of such unparalleled fertility that the liate Shah was able to maintain there an army of 40,000 men during his unsuccessful siege of' the place. The value of the position is enhanced by thes fact that the sfrounding territory to the west, to thae south, and to the east, is comparatively barren. Thea climate is salubrious, water is a undant, and the town is esurrounded by a bank of clay of gret height, and which Isso thick that it cannot be breached by an enemy. Herat igtherefore an inaportant base of operations; a commander in. possession of te town is completely inaster of his own.

oeeru,ssi people, as well as the Government, entertain the belief that they are destined to extend by conquest thepossessions of the empire;'but, as the noble earl has said, I alra believe that there Is no disposition whatever on the partof theRussian Government to to war with ushoithe suabject of territory in the part of the world to which Ianm reerrpng.t uor commnications with the Rupsian oGovernment have be,n franktandf riendly.

I have no doubt that Al these grave considerations were fully weighed by my noble friend opposite (the Earl of Malmesbury), when, n more than one of his able despatches, he recommended Sir Justin Sheil toprotect the territory of Herat. Sir Justin Sheil executed those instructions with great ability and dilgence, and, indeed, went beyond ther. I sa then, that m h noble friend by the anxiety he anitff on te subjpet in 1852, publicly proclaimed to Persa, Afl hanistan, and. India tha
supreme value which he attached to the independence of Heirat. Rem ember mny Lord, that the position we occupyrin the East differs erom that of Russia. She hsp been able to make her power felt, and to' punish Persia for the violation of treatiesorothermisdeeds. Oar positionisentirely dependent upon our characterd n nto otur supposed resolution to maintain otr rights and tmed our interestuat every risk. If, therefore, we permit Persia to violate, with impunity the solemn engagements into which rhe has ewtered with us by treaty, we shall lose our presalitg in that part of the - world. It is for the purpose of maintainOing that prestige which, aifter al, is the great moral force by whi we hold our Indianh empire that Her Malorhaws Government have beemn mnost reluctantly compelled to go to war with Persia. Having said so mauch as to the causes of this war, I may inform lordships, without breach of duty, that tha Persian Ambassador, whohas lately arrived aht PTaris, has solicited anL interview with Lord Cowley, which took placc a few days ago. Hle expressed to Lord Cowley theearnest desire of his Government tha renew fnrondly relations with this country, andr he exhibited to him his full powers to enter into negotiations which he had received from Teheran subsequently to the declaration of the war. Her Majesys Government have not hesitated to say that we shal be prepared to enter into negotiations, and if the powers of tehe Persan Amabassador be such as I believe they are, thngere and ever reasontobeliee that wa y n egotiationdwor be brouht a avouableterinaton.Heor Mfajesty's Go-

I ym express mny entire-dissent from all that has falen from the noble earl with respect to the Chinese war, and I exceedingly regret the expression of such opinions by a persoa in the high psition of the noble earl. There is not the slightest doubt that the lorcha ws to All intents and purposes a British vessel when seized by the Chinese. She ws owned indeed by a Chinese of Hongkong, bat had an thgUish master and carried the English flag. The register, ISt is perfesctl true, had exPirtugede fofive days before the attck adeupo he, bt tat id otat All render her a Chiesevesel,or ivetheChiesepolceany riht to board' wher,and toe tnake aerel crew ha they did.

This was just the position of theo Arrow. This ordlinance is datedl March 3, 1855. It was ratified by an order in Council, and it was communicated and recognised by the Imperis l Commissioner. There could be no doubt as ti the nahionaty of the vessel. As theo name denotes, a lorcha is not a Chinese but a Portuguese vessel, and, in accordancd with the colonial regulations, she had her name paintes on her stern in largeo Roman and Chineso characters.. The Imperisal Comm,ssioner, moreover, ralUowed in his correspondence that he was aware that she had been in poswession of a British register from the time of her launch; andi t ws when she had a British flag flying that she was boarded by the Chinese authorities at Canton. Their professed object was to search for a man who, as theY say, was suspeted iracy, and in order to make sure of ham they carried off 12onut of the crew of 14. The master of the Tessel made his complaint to the consul, who forsarded it to the Chinese Authorities, but they took no notice whatever of it, except to threaten th master with violence if he dic ziot desist from it. Application was made to the Comnmissioner, but this also, iike every other application, waM treated with contemnpt. I am sure the British authorities. were not at all disposd to treat matters with -a high.. hand, but they could not have demanded less than they did without giving another triumph to the Chinese andi Isving the foundLation for future inisults. It was absolutely necessary that they shoulda insist upon an apology and a - restoration of the men. When the affair was handed over to the admiral all that he did At first was to take possessiont of a junk- belonging to the Chinese Government, and before
we sent. an apnrovl of eve that we took th ad-c of the--
saw officers or the Crown as to wrhether the Chinese Government had violated Ithe troaty, and wliether there was any
impro=riety in the admiral takdng Possession of the junk. The ~neon's Advocate was very decided on thatt matter, and in that sense we wrote to Sir John Bow-
risand to the admiral. TheImperial Commissioner was. stal determined to makei no ape! and he refused to hold any direct intercourse with themiral or the plenipotentiary. The admiral then proceoeded, but not ini the snhuman way described by the noble earl, to destroy one of the forts, and then mado fresh representations, and waited a day or two to give time for reflection. Sti finding the Commissioner determined, he went on until all the fortifications belonging to the Chinese Government were destroyed, but as for that destruction of Canton city and the indiscriminate slaughter of its inhabitants of which the noble eal opposite talks, Her Maiesty's Governmuent know of
none; and the noble earl is as much misinformed oh this ashe appeared to bo on several other points on which he. touched in the course of his speech. It is the persistence oE tho Chinese in the system of exclusion, the non-obtervanoc
of that part of the treaty whieh wo ought long ago to have. insisted upon, and which, indeed, we only suspended for a specified time, which lies at the root ofth evil. It embarrasses the transaction of all business, ' obli the
merchants to carry on their affairs by meansoagents, who, aro not always honest; and so long as this system of non. access is persisted in there never will be any improvement in the social moral, and commrcial posi. tion of the Chinese of this part of the empire. Our exclusion from Canton, too, places in danger our relations with the other four ports, for it is made a matterof reproach by the inhabitants of Canton who freluent those ports gainst the inhabitants of them thattheydonot exlude foreigners; and upon more than one oocasion thishasledtoasenousAiots, ThemodeoftrAnsaating busi

Napier, and a few others entered at interva23 and took their accus. tomed seats, and by that time there could not have been fewer than 100 metmbers present.
At half-past 1 " Big Ben" began to peal forth, in a tone of deep, rich melody, the hour for the assembly of both Houses, from his temporary resting place in the vicinity, and a fewn minutes afterwards the Speaker entered, and, prayers having been ,aid, the House awaited theaccustomed summons to appear at the bar of the Honse of Lords. Shortly after 2 o'clock Sir Augustus Clifford, Gentlem'n Usher of the Black Rod, entered the house, and, advancing to the table in the usualway, delivered a messagefrom the Lords Commissioners, desiring the immodiate attendance of the Commons in the House of Peers to hear Her liajesty's Commission read. The Speaker, preceded by the Serjeautat-Arms, then repaired to the House of Lords, foll6wed by the members of the House of Commonsindisoriminately, but with more of order than formerly. The procesion wAs joined on its way- by Lord Palmerston, who heard the Queen's Speech - it the bar, with the rest of the Commons' and accompanied them on their return to their Qwn chamber. On the return of the Speaker at 20 minutes past 2 the House immediately adjourned until a quarter to 4 o'clock.
The House resumed at A quarter to 4 o'clock.

At tho beginning of the provious session it w'as scarcely known whether we were' at war br at peace. Her ajesty aminoumped that oivrtuar.
for peace'had been received, Abut at the sameitime h.ii£ Wisely counseUed increaseApreparations for war. Wietber those overtures of peace from an enemy we distruaed were* or v ero not sincere, -whether the struggle ought to-be COiDrtintted, thereby largely augmenlting the buidens and' edn' fices of the people,' or wvhether it wnas a'cout to termiatit-. whether themost efficient arnmament that everieft om shoress war to go on and' ful15l its mission 'and veaken the'.Power *

These negotiations termninated, contrary to the expectation; of most persons, in the treity of peace concluded at Paris idi March hs~t year, and ailthoug&h the ternms of that peace w ere deemed by the people of England more favourable to our vweakened enemy thsn from the conduct of the Court of St. Petersburg it-was entitled to expect, aAnd although somer disapprobation was feltby many Englishmen that peace hAad been concluded before a more decisive blow had been struck,. yet there was no hesitation on the part of a generoas andL peace-loving nation in aAdopting that treaty wvhich the Save. reign was advised to ratify, and the more so becauso in -tho vory inoderetion of the t'erms of pe¢ace the British natiOit sawv the best guarsAnteo for their strict and hononrable fulfiltnout. (Cheers.) It wva-s not for him to say howv far those lust expectations and that generous confidonce had beens. borne out by events, but lho confessed ho heard writh surpriso-' of those difficulties in the constrrctcion of th'e details' of' the tre^aty to which Her Miajesty had, referred. lIe hid heard wirth surprEse the questions that had arisen relative to Bolgrad, the Isle of Serpents, and the strengthening of the Brit;ish 9ceet in the Black Sea, and he hea'rd wvith' dismay that a second conference wa13 to ho held atBParis for the resettlement of those questions for which the p-oplo of E:ngland had already rejoiced and illuminated, under the mis.- appreheonsion that they had been settled many months before. But wrhatever the IViDginS which, wtth mainy others, he entertained at that; tlme, they served hut to'en-
hnce te obligations of the Speo,ple of this 'country to those who 'had prevented their realization. (Cheers ) lt mnustbe admitted thst'the position of the British Cabint wrhen that second conFerence vWas held was one of great difficulty and. responsibility, and that if it had required great ability and firmness to secure the terms of last year it d-manded equal ability and still grester firmness to enforce their exeouhson. (Cheers.) 'It could not bo in tbepowver of any Minister to. pronide against an *ttempb to misconstrue the most solemn. treaty, but it might be mn his powver, as it certainly wvas his duty, to defeat snch anattempt. (Hlear, hear. )'Itvwas his duty to show that, whAile something might be conceded to a nation thast asked for no sacrifice of principle, yet that thero rested the powver of distinguishing between that wihich might be conceded with honour and that which must be retained. So long as vital points were at issue it'
was the dnty of the Government to show that if other' Powersminsconceived the construction of the treaty, Eng-
land did not. He was lure that in that house, where the - honour of public men and the honour of the country were inse~Darably connected, it would be recollected writh pride. byalsdsof the House, that the Mlinister of England had the courage to proclaim that, although this country valued her alliances, she was not dependent npon them. (loud' cheers.) The M[inister who had appealed to his countrymen to say whether the exzecution of the terms of the treaty should not be the condition of that peace wrhich England, in the fiuUness of her strength, had conceded to.
the exhaustion of her enemies and her allies, had re-- ceived an answer from his fellow countrymen so intellig~ib'e and prompt that it must have dispelled whatever doubts foreign Governments might have entertained, and it left to their diplomnatists nO more onerous task than to record the settlement of that to which they had previously assented. (Cheers.) HIer MIajesty informed thorn that in. conjunction with the Emperorof the French she had caused. com!munications to be made to the King of the Two Sicilies which had not been resnonded to in a corresponding spirit, *nd that consequently diplomatic intercourse between Great Britain and France and the Court of Naples had been sns*pended. Her Maesty had also to deplore that hostilities had broken out betwveen the British Government and those of Persia and China. Ho did [not hold, because thu monarehy of iNaples vrasso mn-serably feeble. and because any resistance that was likely to be made by'Persia and China w ould easily be overcomne, that on those accounts the questions at issue with those Powvers were unimportant. Imnportant principles, on the contrary, were involved in these disputes, and very large results might followv. But, as the information which the HIouse at present p)ossessed on these subjects was imperfect, and as Her Majes"ty had ordered the papers to be laid on the taeble, he should only adopt the course which the House woutld itself be likely to follow and. refrain from e.xpressium any opinion as to transactions which, in their present stateo ~fIgnorance, it wvould beimprudent and might be injurious to enter upon. Passing from foreign to domestic topics, Hier Majesty had suggested the duty of reducingas far as possible the public expenditure witha viewv to the lescsening of taxation. This wasa duty at aU times mot grateful, but es,eciaUly so after the experience recentlyw afforded of the spirit and patriotism with which the 'orest taxpayers had welcomed their share of the burdens of a just war (hear, hear)-an experience the more commendable when the House remembered howv sensibly the humbler classes were affected in their homes and comforts bv what mih perto the more wealthy a scarcely perceptible inces tiaaon. (Hear, hear.) No doubt the public expected that a relief from war would be followed byes rebief from taxation ; and, however inconvenient it might be to the Chancellor of tho Exchequer, they believed that a reduction in some form or other wFas inevitable. (Cheers.) But when it devolved upon the Chancellor of the Exchequer to devise howv this relief was to be apportioned among the public the prospect of giving general satisfaction did not apTear to be very cheering. (^A laugh.) It was matter for dispute whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer was in the least enviable prodicanent when he had a deficiency or a surplus. jA Chancellor of the Exchequer with a defiCiency had this great advantage, that he was an object of envy to none, but of pity- to all. HAis misfortunes begot many friends who sympathized writh his sorrow,s. But a Chancellor of the Eixchoquer expanding and glowing^ with a surplus expected to find no friends. He reminded him of a prize ox in the presence of a councitl of butchera (a laugh}. and he was disposed to' condole with his right hon. friend on the periLs attached to his position. HTis would be tha difficult task to reconcile large concessions with a p^ersistence in large demands-to make large reductions, andyet to retain the means of maling a large expenditure. It would be his right hon. friend's duty especially to bear in mind in the niilihary estimates that, although great armaments were jealous ly regarded in time of peace, yet that small ones were incompatible with the seurity of extended possessions. (Cheers. ) The last war had taught the country tbat itwas dan.- geronstoallowour stores to be toomnuch lessened, indthat the Government hadnot provided a sufficient armamentbocahuse the estimates had not provided for a snllcitnt force of men. That n considerable and expensive rirmy must bolkept un by England no rational man couzld for a moment' doubt.
Not that it was desirable to rival or to imitate the conti-' nental nations, by whom great armies were maintained to impoverish the subjects against whom they protcoted their governments, but it could not be forgotten that Great Britain had territories to watch over and subjects to defend
in every quarter of the globe, and that her vast wealth and.' commerce, which had establishments in every land and ships on every sea, brought her into constant collision with other States, (Hear, bear.) Ther could not remembertoe often that while the defenceless state of a rich nation wvasa perpetual incentive to aggression, preparration for wvar wa the surest guarantco for peace. (Hsear, hear.) lie therefore predicted that there wvould be no desire on the part of the
House of Commons to demur to the expenditure necessay for our naval and military esotablishments, AK large expenditure on those establishments was not onlya necessity but a duty, and any Mlinister who shrunk from iks
porformance would be unworthy of his post. But the House
had a right to ask that whiateveor sums were thns spent
should be well spent (hoar, hoar), that tho natiou should re
ceive a full equivalent for its outlay, that every department
should be conducted with the greatest combination of cooroiny and efficiency, and that every - rvmetkow

If, that be so, I am afraid the treaty we have made with the lJited Sitates, the substance of which I approve, has mot been drawn with all the care that was-desirable; becatise, instead of making - a surrender contiDgent upon the assent of Parliament, the island of Ruatan bas been absolutel handed over to the
State of Honduras. If I amn wrong fn these stements I . ihall be glad to be eorrected ; but the subject is one to which I feel it my duty to call the attention of the Gover-
ment, and respecting which Isubmiithatinformation ought. to be given to thiu house Sir, with respept to the unhappy events wbich havo occurred in China, I mustsay it would have been agreeable to me if they bad been noticed .in the

(Hear. With regard to another question.of 4eFt importanIce-I mean Persia-I am diposed to compla that no promise of information has been given to the House. Upon the merits of that quarrel at the present momaent I do not
sume to pronounce; yet at the sare time I must proce Edo the point of saying that no facta have appeared in the pub 'c journals, or in any sourcee of information open toD 3me, which afford any adenate justification for our pro. ceedings.(EHear, hear.) do not speak of justification merely on the bare and dry point whetber, as an advocate in a cOUrt of justice, we can show that somebody has committed an abstract wrong. Much more than that is required to' stifyth Government of En d involving the country in rostilitiea The cause must eadeguate and the necessity strong. (Hear.) I trust, therefore, we shal' hear that information with regard to Persia wl speedily be laid before the House. But there are two other quesUons, and . uestions of great importance, in connexion with this question of Persia, upon which 1 think it my duty not to refrain from offering a remark, because those two questions do not depend on any matter of right touching the controversy, or toucbing the local or even the Asiatic policy of tlis country, but relate to matters ofdomestic importance, having a powerful and immediste bearing on the welfare of the people and the duties of Parliament. The first is this-By whose authority has the war against Persia been waged 2 (Hear, bear.) I think it is not difficult to see that the war against Persa has its root elsewhere than in Calcutta. Of the sentiments of the Governor-General I have no knowledge, except the knlowledge derived from his own proclamnation, but I munst confess the terms of that proclamation conveyed to my mind the impression that the oxpedition to Persia was undertaken by commands from London, and not by order of the Sunpreme Council at Calcutta. The expedition from Bombay sets sail, but by whoso command? By commands from Londoa; nd this, unless I am much mistaken cuts very deep into the consideration of thequestion, by ;wat system is our government of Indba carried on?2 (lIeir.* Who is it that
has given orders for thiis Pergian war? speak in igno-. ance, but I ask for information which I think the House is entitled to receive. (Hear, hear.) Ias it been done by the Court of Directors of the East ndi Company?2 The theory of our East India Government- which, to use a bomelyph , is in a very lealey state, X, that it is a subject not fit to be handled by the rude hand of Parliament,that there must be an intermediate body, apart from the influence of Parliament, beyond a remote izfluenoe, in order to secure the good government of India. I canconceive the advantage, though not paramount to the objections, of governing India through the medium of a body not under the direct control of Parliament. I can conceive the advantage of placing India under direct Parliamentary government; but there is one system which haas the recommendation of neither of these two, and it is this: -The setting up a body, nominally the governors of India, that shall really servo to estop Parliament considering the interests of India, but at the same time shall have no power whatever to check the discretion or caprice of Ministers
either by privileges of its own or by any effective appeal to the House of Commons. If India is to be governed bv t Court of Directors, then we are entitled to expet that these mesures, which never had the sanction of Parlias lent, must have had the sanction of the Court of Directors. I beg to put the question to the Eirst Minister of the Crown, whether the expedition undertaken against Persia, and the
Dolicyof that expedition, bave had the sanction of the
nrt of Diectors, or been adopted with their knowledge ? (Hear, hear.) I think no man can regard the Persian war without considering how it is thatt wars of the kind have come to be waged under the name of being merelylndian wars. Would it be right that we, holding India as we do, and having entered into this quarrel with Persia, removed by so many hundred. lesones from our Indian empire, should compel the eople of ndiatobearthcharge? If itis rightthatthey sould bear the charge, then it is right that the Court of Directors, who govern India, should have something to say; but we have no information upon the question, at whose charge this wariswaged? (Hear,hcar.) Iwishtoaskthe nobielord at the head of the Government whether any arrangement has been made by Her Majesty's Government with the Court of Directors, or otherwise, for charging either the vhole or a portion of tho expenses of the Persian war upon the revenues of this country? (Hear,'hear.) I may be wrong, and it may be an old-fashioned notion, but I have less scruple in expressing it, because I cannot be deemned to say it in concert with any person or any party, but I frankly own that if Her Majesty's Government have carried us into a European war, it was their duty to have called Parliament together at the first moment when they ventured to contemplate so serious a step. (Cheers.) I will not now iquire whether there be any precedent which may either palliate their neglect, or, in their own estimation, justify their proceedings; but I will say, without fear of contradiction, that the practice of commencing wars without associating Parliament with the first measures is utterly at variance with the establinied practice of the country, dangerous to the constitution, and absolutely requiring the intervention of this Housc in order to render the recogn
tien of so dangerous a proceeding utterly impoible. (Cheers.) I pass from the consideration of our foreign policy toourpolicyathome. When I readthe paragraph in the gracous Speech from the Throne in relation to the bank and the currency, I was impressed with thebelief that Her Majesty's Government were about to invite us to legslate on those questions. I think that a proposal well matured by the Executive Govern. meat and supported by its authority would be much more likely to lead to a satisfactory consideration ofthe queshon than the mere reference of the subject to a select committee; but, as I find the Chancellor of the Exchequer has given notice of a motion that a aelect committee shal be appointedfor the consideration of these important matters, I will venture to express the hope that the Goverment wdi go into that select committee with the view of guiding its deliberations, and proposing to it a definite plan. (Hear hear.) I catnot too respectfully and, at the same time, i cannot too gravely submit to the House that unfortunate changes have for many years been taking place in the credit, dignity, and efficiency of the proceedings of its select committees on questions of public interet and im. portance. There are hap y exceptions; there are cases in which select committees have thoroughly investigated the matters referred to them, and presented most valuable reorts which have become, or may become, the besis of useful leslatlon, baht I thaink the public feel that too much of a sivenly character on the whole marks the invest-igation s of our committees (bear, hear), and I think there are fewr members who have not found that the labours of the select committees of the other House .have boeen contrasted with our select committees to the credit of the Upper ar,d to the disadvantage of this House. (Hear, hear.] I hope that will not be the case with his committee) andJf hb goes into that committee readytoproose a definite course on the t of the Government that will be likely to lead the committee to asafe decision. I do not say what the nature of that course ought to be, and I think that this paragraph of theQaeen's Speechwas perhaps expressedwith less of caution than the importance of the subject deserved It states, " Her Majesty commands us to recommend to your consideration the expediency of renewiDg for a further period the privileges of the Banlkof England." Now, Sir, I save avery strong opinion thatthe privileges of the Bank of Egngland, properly so called, require revision quite is the Bank and the State ar;e eext)remXel irll-adefined.Threy date from a period when financial ideas were immature, when -public faith did not exist, and wrhen it
was -important to induce a: body of merchants to become security forth State. These were the circumnstances that called the Bank of England intowexstence. Iladmit that theBank of Englandahas rendered great services to the State, but mi0ch f the relations niow existing between the State and the Bank of England is based upon these antiquated and In the present day highly inappropriate ideas. (Hear.) There fore I am prepared to contend that whatever arrangement is made with the Bank of Englad should ho agreed to after comprehenlsive and careful investgation of the whole matter, and of the character of the Bank of Eugland as the agent of the State for the purposs of finance. I think that this paragraph ought not to have indicated a foregone concluts-ion with repect to the renewal of the Act of I844 (Hear,. hear.) That act was one of a long cours of progressve mneasures. It did not pretend, In the judgment of K~r Ii. Peel, its responsible author, to a charater of, absoluto finality. 1 ama not prepared to unsettle any portion of that act for the state of things ethat existed before that maeasure was sgpeed to. But. it cougt to ho understood that it is openx to considerationa whether the act of .1844 is capable of improvements -that wouldanot frustrate the beneficial -purpos-es of Is-i- author, but would give increased asaurance,to the commniqity tAhat we are beginning to emerge from the series of monetary experfiments, and are shout to bring our3moneta.ry system,to a comprehensive, and perlhanesnt,mand established basi. (Bear, hear.) But, Sir, a more mportant subjoat stil remnains, mzpon whiceh the right boa, gentleman has announced his.intention tosubmit--a motion to .the House. -I have~ 'watched with-interest the mneetinjgsan rediswhc

(A. laugh). There las been much discusdoi
-and I do not wonder at it-upon. the questionL wl'et'ir the Income-tax should be' levied at a permanent orvafried iste. I agree that as long as yout have an income-tax jyot will neaver entirety get rlid of that discussion, and this oou; victiOn and the POlitical danigers ot. this tax led m6to th -co_clusion that the-income-tax is an admirable instrument for natibonal purposes upon a great and adequate emer-
ecy,. but that it is a dangerous instrument to reainin tieofea (Cers. there has been tluch
daiscuaiois whether an Income of 100O. should pay, or an. in. come of 150., and whether. the possessr.of an locomeo of 15hZ. should pay upon that income or upon the 11. surplus. Thrhas Meen still more diussion on the cemation of ,war taxation, and un thems subjects I shall not evsda Eilg Amopimon. ButI desire to bring the members of thiaiouse,-and, what is more necessary, for the difficulty is out of doora, to bring the country-to consider the quos-
n Whatthejust,ndreasonable apale of expenditure for your esablisments during peaoo.?' (Cheers.) That Is the question upon which we mutt best6w our care if we intend to discharge our daties to the pebple of this count
(Cheers) Upon Ihis subect we are- not entirely without information, eveni on the- day of the Speech from thte Throne. There is a portion of the country e guay fa*voured, forinthe town of Arbroathx and. other' favoured placesin the north-estof Scotland-the most interesting disclosures have been conovyed from theblinister of War to his delighted neghbotirs am Mends. I will not dwell up6
the announcement which he made relati-c to the report of the Crimean- commissioners (bear), although I do mot understand why that time or that place should havwe boen chosen for communicating the views which Lord Panmure entertains upon the labours of Sir X. M'Nelll and Colonel TuI1och: (Hear, hear.) lwillnotdr_agmaitsabje6tin,ow, but it will probably not escape the atbtntion of this House. (Hear, bear.) But another announcement was made in ArbroAth, -The noble lord the Secretary of State for War stated tohis friends that. there would be a reduction of 2,OO0,0o0z. in the military estimates of the present yefr. I make no doubt that he did not refertotho n Avl departnents, and that he, of course, meant theestimates for the,army, ordnauce, militia, and commissaimat. Now, Sir, there Is no way of getting right upon this subject, except by coming to figus It is uwless to bandy generalities and to say, on the one band, that a niggardly economy and
state, of unpreparedness for war invite invasion and runthe risk of Eeat calamities. That is not only the truth, but atruism. to speak, on th ooter hand, of the virtue of ecoromy ant of remitting the burdenof taxation, is a
truism at the other enl of thediameterof the circle. Figures are the only intelligible language, and ihse
given us through the noble lod's araciou benevolence to the people of Abroath. (A laugh.) The noble lord said that the military estimates would be reduced 20,00,0001. Tbey were ,000,0001. last year. I speak of the unreduoed estimates of last year, because the reduced estimates were just 20,500,0001., and if they were redueed 20.000,0001. a very small margin would be left. (A. l aug.) The noble lord's intention apparently is to submit to us estimates of L4,000,0001. or 15,000,0001, for the military departments. Then ther is the naval department; but
as my right hon. friend the Firstlord of the Admiralt- has not been to visit his friends at Halifax this year our information respecting that department is meagre (a faugh); but I am afraid, if I may judge from the loose rumours that reach me, that the measures of retrenchmentto be applied to the navy wll not be any more stringent than those to be applied to the army. I read the other day a declration of my hon. friend the member for Buty (MEr. F. Peel), that his mind had been much relieved b the announcement made by Lord Panmure. (A laugh.) I do not know the capacity of my hon. friend's mind for reoeiving relief, but my mind was far from relieved-it was seriously disturbed by that announcement. I will not consent to look at the largeness of the figures of the reduction about to be made. In asking for supplies at the beginning of the war we told the House not to look at thelargeness of the figures,butatthenecessities of the case, and .mow that the necessities of the case have pawed away I must look, not at what you take away, but at whatyou leave, and that I mustmeasure by comparing it with what, according to the best evidence in our poesession, are the real necessities of the country. Inthe absence of positive information my right hon. friend at the head of the Admiralty will excuse me for making a guess at his estimates. Last year,before theywore reduced,they were 20,000,0001.; after
aey were reduced they were 16.500000. That sum in-
cluded no less than o,000,0001. fortSe transportserviee,--an item which I shouild hope would now be reduced to altogether insgnificant proportions. No doubt, my right honffiendwMill gveus somereduotionfromtheremainng 11500,0001., bnt I amnafraid lamfor;nsim too favourble an opinion of him if I conjecture that Tls estimate will amount to about 9,000,0001. Adding that 9,000,0001. to Lord Panmure's -14,000,0001, nmyconjecture takes the form of an expenditure u th pe establishment of this country of 24,00,0DOG.Oorr2S ,0,000L. a-year. I wish Icould beleve that I had fallen into any gross error in this compntation, but I do not stand upon the precise figures, for If the Amount is anything near the sum I have named the grounds of objection and the necessity for the positive interference of the House are exactly the same. iHear, bear.) In considering the necessities of the countryl must look hack at our experience before the war. True, we now wish toimnprovemuchthat existedhbefore the war, and many of thoseimprovements annotbe carried out withoutexpense, Wehavealseenwith pleasurethe improvementsinthemate. rial of the greatcoats of the sen'tries who areexposed tothis blasting weather, ai7d whatever tends to the physical comfort of the soldier, whatever tends to the recognition of the fair claims of the offlicer whatever is necessay toatrbact into the service of Her kajesty the highest clas of men both as regards mental and bodily qualities, will, I am sure, never be grudged by this House. (Hear, ear.) Butt the charges and expenses necessayfor carrying outthese objects are not heavy. The charges. and expenses we are called upon to defry arise from different causes, and they connect themselves in some measure with the foreign policy of this country, and with the degree to which it is to cultvate the respect and the goodwill of other nations. (Hear, hear.) If it be true on the one hand that changes must be made in our militery system, it is not the less true, on the other hand, that important and happy changes have taken place in the condition of the country and of the empire, tho operation of which tends strongly to economy; I mean economy as compared with the standard of expenditure before the war. (Hear, bear.) What is tho condition of our colonies ? I repcl the doctrine that because you are foundingh vastcolonial empire you mrut have a vastforce to defendit. On the contrary, the only colonies which ever really required military assistance were either those in wehic itvwas made necesary by your slavesystem in order to keep down a black ppulation, or else the great military garrisons which you have now ceased to acquireand multiply. As regards colonies, it is plain&that theoprogress of free institutions mnust and ought to carry with it the oblgation to discharge the burdens which are a part of the veY titleto and inheritance of freedom. (Hear, hear.) Then you had beforo the war 2o,000 and sometunes 30,OO men acting as a police force in Ireland, and the great bulkl of your troops in England were discharging duties of a similar character. Buta great change has now taken place. In most of the great towns you have an efficient police foroe, and you are sabjecting the real property of the country as well as the taxpayers generally to a very heavy charge on account of it. (Hear, hear.) It requires no detailed argment to show that the establishment of this po ce forco has enabled you to - dispense with the employment of the military in services which they had to discharge 20 years ago. I cannot at this moment presume to say whether you ought to keep your military estimates down to the precie figure at which on an averae of years they stood before the war, but there is a very arge margin between that figure and the estimates you now propose. The average amount of the estimates during the 40 years! peace was 14,000,0001., and they were at their lowest point in 1835, when they amounted only to 12,000,000&. Since 1835 they have risenconsiderablybutnhave rahrel ex-
or 20 years you have been creating a new fleet with a now system of propulsion at an enormous temporary expenditure. This being the amount of the estimates before the war, tbe Government novw propose, as I umderstand, to raise them to a snm at leat considertbly exceeding 20,000,0001., a sum about double th-T lowest estimateof thelat peac%,andexceeding by 6,000,0001., 7.000,001.,or8,00O,0001.tbeestimatesofthoseyearsinwhich you were creating your stean fleet. I am authorized to speak the sentiments of no man; but some gentlemen with whom Iam in familiar intercours agree with me, Ibelieve, in the opinion that we must look at the expenditure of the country (hear) ; that this Housecannot fully discharge its duties by lookdig only at,taxation. (Hear, hear.) Let rme pot out to my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer the danger in which. we might find ourselves, We might, to please our constituents, vote away the ninth of the income-tx. We miight also, and I
reallt believe we should plese many of our constituents by so doing, vote enormous and immoderate esia ne-ph _ coseuecewol be tha th oen
estimate. Ther consequnmc wrould be that the Government would be compelled to fill up the vacuum by proposing either new taxation, or to borrow money in the first yearofthepece. (Hear.) Iamnotwilingto berespon.
sible for any sueh alternative. (Hear, hear.) I feel it mr bounden duty, first, to lay hold of the proposed oxpenditure, and it i3 my conviction that if it be the opinion of the Government that it is necessary to maintain a military establishment upon a scale at all approaching to that whichl
I have named we must deal wit the estimates, not by I
nibbling at them hero and there, but by a general motion
taking the sense of tho House upon the expediency of saddling the country with such a charge. (Hear, hear.) I am fairly bound to say that if no person better entitled to the attention of the Housa should undertake the taslr, I shall take on myself the responsibility of mak:ng a maotion in theeircumstancesIhavesupposr ahouldthey oocur, in ordertoobtain the judgment of theRodsesa3 tothe duty it owes the publc in reference to the-estimates to be ido tea founding myself on theatatement of fact which,fell fron Lord fanmure.

Thb treaty wasaigned on'the 30th of YMa1, aud On- the 8th of Apri -in consequence of a statement delivered In by the Eaian Mniste, and. now lying on tbe table of the house, LordClaendon, having.lnducod ti
French Minister formally to open theafair, imad that re. maclabl. xtatement which appea in the protocos, which is, n fact reproduction of the State paper of Count
avour, w points to the abnormal state eC Central ItV, occasione by the occpation of foreign troo 3pe. tial0y by those of mstxia; and not ol to the %.norrmal but to the highly exceptionable ta?te of the kingdom of .Naples.- Now, theouocan recall withvividneessallthat has occunred since that momintt with respect to the affnars of Italy, and it Is. of the utmost importance- that they should remember It. The country wasthen expecting to reap the fruits consequent on a uccessAfil war and the treaty of peace; and yet, in eooctquence of steps taken especill by the E ,lish Government in respect to Italy, no sooner wa s e TVrlish d1. culty nshed thani that of Itl appeared and instantly attracted and engrosed t1he attention of this country. How was it poesble for nen ito recur to those domestic - circumstancew which demanded considerationI how. was It posible to .wean the public mind from the extingoonsldorationsof war, when. Tou were impressing it tha public mind,of Europe, and attee publlc opmion of EnMand thata = t,stru e was about to- tae pce in Itay, and that te me had at length arrived when It'y wod be regenerated, and regenerated under the patronge of the great Powers of:Europe? Why, it became a que4t on whether we should not awake any morning and hear tbat an Englis fleet vas in the y of-Naples. Tht was a t fat credited bye:very gentleman, wha4tver masy be bis pelities! t opinions oth sideg of tis House.' So- seriouis becme, the aspect of affairs and thetemper of che public mind-upon it, that one of the most distinguished -members of thi,
louse-the noble lord the member for-London-felt it his duty atthe end of the last esswon tobring the state of Central Italy before the House, and In doing so the noble lord madegthe protocolsof the treaty of PF.irl thefound ;- tion of his motion. The very fact that one of the mn s distinguished statesmen in the House at the cloee of i sesslon, felt it his duty to brine this subject underthe c-a. sideration of the House, stamped it with additional gravity. to that which the m3atter itself posessed. It became a subjectof speculation what would be the consequence of Har Majesty's Government entering into those protocols Sam.
ound ult with the noble lord only for an act o£. parent rashness, while others sought to exouse him in consilerationof the ilgh-spirited remonstrncea he had made with regard to the occupation of pas of Italy by forein troops, and especially by those of kA tla; and It became a question whether a war would not again be waged en the_great battle teld of Europe, and whether that heroIc French army which had alroady gained such lasting renown might not saln be summoned to action. But what I want to impres on tho House is that the osnsequence of all this was that for six months the mind of England was distracted and diverted from the consideratI mn of its domestic interests. No step w tasken to-reduce the large establishments whih the war had called into xstence e no measu of domestic or economical Improvement coah be entertained when to-morrow we might awake aad find Austria and France in hostility and the whole of Europe inu ames. We know how slow Her Majesty's Ministers were in crying their promls of interference in the stae of Italy Into action. We expected the King of Naples was to be coereed into acquiescence, and were in daily anticipation that a French mnybad occupied ithecentre of Itly. Will itbe believed that at theverytimewhenLordClarendon was Iistenn to the pasionaterepresentations of Count Chvou., In which he Impeaches the very existence of Auastran rule in the aecond memorandmo en the table, a secret treaty waS in existence ruaranteeing to Austria the whol'e of her Italian domimons . (Cheers.) Why, Sir, I don't say thls is any cause forcavilagpinstA Astwnakill;I admire the wonderful adroltnees-I would say, thesucceasful wisdom-with which Austa has managed throughout the whole of the late struggle the conduct of her aSdrs. We have seen her reaping the hfuits of victory without having had to enter npon a campaign, and we have seen the war concfd ed by Austa obtaining that which, I believe, the most sanguine of her grbat Statesmen could never have ventured to hope to gain. (Hear, hear.) "A guarantee from whatPowerr says the noblelord. Why, a guarantee from the only rower that Austria ferd upon such a subject-a guarantee from Frauce to Ausria of ter Italian posseeons-a guarantee iven not 3nerely with the sanction andapproval of the noblelord, but given b the advice and at the gecial instance of his Government. 9Hear, hear.) Let the House observo this secret treaty is not denied, although it is now mentioned for the first time. (Hear, hear.)
Lord PALIEME TON.-By what rower?
Mr.DISRAELL-"1y what Power'asks the noble lord. Why,we knowthat it is not E n d that can cross the Alps. The Power that can cross the Zprand can threaten Austri,. is that Power which, according to the reDresentations of the noble lord and of his Minister, is actually a Dartner in this great scheme for the emandpation of Italy hear,hear), a p lan which was to have accomplished hose great objects for the attainment of which the noble lord possesses the confidence of the Liralparty Inthis contr, but hich has not led. to those hberal reslts which bad been so sincerely and ardently desied. ear, hear. Now, I think this is a circumstance which throw some little light upon our relatious with Italy. Rend the protocol in which Lord Clarendon makes that memorable statement with respect to the measures which he thinks should be adopted towards Italy. Read tt protocol now that Ihave given you the key-note of the m ,- nd then you will understand the haughty contempt with which Cont Bn 1 listened to Lord Clarendou-you can comprehend the scofling derision with whichthe other Austrian negotiator,Baron Birack,heard the representationsof the English Government. They Interfereto drive out the Austrians, or to induce Austria to withdraw from the occup tion of the Rom%n provinces? Why, Sir, the Austrian Inister, with a gusrantee of all the Italian dominions of his Sovereign in his pockeet what did he or his coleage care for these representations which werebrouhtforwardwith such pomp in the House of Commons, aaich were made the bais and foundation for the conlidence which the noble lord had claimed from the Liberal pa in this country? (Hear.) When the noble lord the member for the city of London - brought forward, with the authority which must slwals
attend any motion which he makes, and with the conststency which becomes him, t he she state of Italy, and particularly of the occupaton of Central Italy by Austria, he listened to the answer of the noble lord at the head of the Government and then declared himself satisfied with that answer. I ask now does the noble lord (Lord J. Russell) still consider that answer quite satisfactory' I ask any man was the Minister justified in holding out io Italy, to England, and to Europe that he was sincerely determined to change the aspect of social and political life in Italy, especially in Central and Southern Italy, when at the same time he knew that he had made the nation a party to an instriument whereby the supremacy of Italy was rendered complete and universal? (ear, ear.) WVe know that fact now; it has not been denied by the noble lord, although until now, no doubt, he believed the secret was locked up in his own breas. L.t me remind the House what has happened In consequence of this ruinous imposture upon the credulisy of thecountry? How muchtimeehaveyoulost-whathave yon done for the benefit and advantage of Italy? Iremember maildn some humble observations upon the motion of the noble lord (J. Russell) last session, not, indeed, against the improvement of the condition of Italy, which all of us must desire, but warming the House not to interfere in ltalian politics unless prepared to interfere actively and with effect. (Hear, hear.) We did not interfere-we did not make up our minds to interfere actively. We had pro. tocols, we had State papers, we had speeches in Parliamens, we had a motionmacehya distinguished Liberal lord, and we had expressions of ympathy from numerous Liberal members; and yet what has happend? Ruthless sassin%tions, unsuccessful Insurrections, death to many excellent and some-brave and distinguished men, the aggravation of every evil of which you then complained, the exaggeration of aH the misovernmentwhich you then denounced. (Hear, bear.) You tareatened the King of Naples, and the King of Naples treated you with contempt. Hear, hear.) The King of Naples, attacked or menaced by such a Power as Enland, with whom he could not contend upon eqal terms, of course consulted that Power near him which was his frxend-of course he consulted Austria. The King of Naples I have no doubt said something to this effect, " I count upon the friendship of Austria, but I do not wish to bring Austria, niy friend, into dangerous collision with the great western Powers. Those Powers I see are determined to have a revolution in Italy, ad are trying by all means to encourag the discontented olases, but to have again a French arm crossng the AlIM and Ens1ih gold -employed

Bnt I found in September that we had never had arel peace, only an armed truce; that we were again going to war with Rusia, that we were going te war without our ally, that we had to encounter at the same tune Rusdan duplicity and French perfidy, and - that we were on the 'verge of a contest of a very alarming character. (Hear.) It wasstill more strikng, because Ihad the impresfioi that Russia had given up the confes, being exhausted both In men and money, and having made up her mind not to continue a policy which she was convinced must lead to the same, ruinous result. But -I found there was again a dii. culty. There was again another Russian difficultT. It is not necessry that I shoulcl enter into details with which eery gentleman Is rrfectly familiar; I will only say, for myseaf that I erish t eue should be no misconcetion to what IFconsldered, and what themajority of the ou co n. aidered, were the legitmate objects o the late war with Russia. When that question was first discus3ed, in 1854, I sAid I thought no peace could be satisfactory to this country in which the independence of the Black Sea and the freedom of the Danube were not secured. (Hear, hear.) Those subjects waere not then so famliarly known as they are at sresent; -but two years afterwar, when the wildest no=0A5wereentertawned onthe subject of the war and the trms
of peace-when we were tolI that nothing short of the disnemberment of.empires, the destruction of thrones, and the.4hange of d es would be satisfactorv, I took the liberty, thoeh aI sported the war as a politic and proper measure, of laying itwn far more moderate termss on which pace might and ought to be scured. Those terms Involved the two gTeat polnts, the independence of the Black Sea and. the fredom of the Danube; and I ay frankly anid fairly to the noblo lord that if he found in the month of September, whatever the cause or the means that the onntrywasdeprivdof one of theprime objectsforwhich they hd made uch en wau s and eostly srifice of life and ireasure, it-wa hi duty, even at the risk of anotherwar, to attAin thoee obecots (Chetr.) I do not see how hie could. have facied this HousDe, or hotr he could have faced the oountry, if, afer announcing that he haa inegotiated peace and attained those objecs he had ha to communicate that one of the moet important was lust to us, tea;r, hear.) I give the noble lord fuU credit for rbat feeling. But the question then s who placed thisgreat point in jeopardy? (Hear, hear.Wh weraweabouttolseth6trult*hlc'wesonchly deserve
I hear a great deal about Russian maps and Russian duplicity. I hear a great deal about French ma and French

(Cheer We know ver well-no one denies now-that this town of ohgrad was, as far a the letter of the treaty was concned, left in the posseadon of Rusia. Never mind what was the uirit of the treat. o far as England was concerned, she determined that the freedom of the Danube shoald be secured. With Russia posessIng Bolgrad the freedom of the Danube wa not secured. hen why did Russia poesess Bolgrd ? I am told that the Russian Mnister behaved ver ill. Oh I wicked Baron Branow, whose conduct wAs so fsagtitious as to attend to the interests of hls master! (A laufh.) Oh ! ungrateful Baron Brunowr, iho, after all the clviity and hospitality he reoeived In London, did not, when in Paris, do for Lord Clarendon that which Lord Clarendon ought to hxve done for himself I (Laughter.) Now, that is the real state of the case. (Hear, bear.) I sbould have been per. fectly ready to support any Government which resolved to obtain the results for which we fought and which we thought we had obtained. But when it is a blunder of our own negotiator, I do not seo the advantage of tuming round upon our late foe and our present ally and accusing them of duplicity and want oflaith. (Hear.) lordClarendon was not in theleast hurried because he found time to recommend in. terference in the aZalrs of the kingdom of Naples, to which I have alluded, and he fohnd time to discuss measures to curband, rhapMsuppress thelibertyof th ressthroughout Europe. M Fear.) Lord Clarendon, one wourd suppose, must have possessed ample means to obtain all the information he required. His position is remarable. Lord Clarendon went to obtain the independence of the Black Sea and the freedom of the Danube, snd he omitted to obtain one of those important points which he was sent to Pari specially to secure. Was it from want of information? That is the most charitable view. But, want of information? Why, you had an ambassador at Constantinople. He may ha
his failings, but all agree that he is a man of great experience, great energy, and great ability, and that he is supported y a diplomatic staff probably the most disciplined and the most able which surrounds any Minister (Hear hear.) 'Throughout all the provincesof the Turkish empire throughout the principalities themselves, you had costly consular establishments. Onewouldbaveaupposed that your diplomatic and consular sources of information would have furnished Lord Clarendon with sufficient knowledge at least to obtain tbat, which lwas the object of war and the Cause of negoiation. He had, besides, all the arch'ves of the Foreign-o!iSce in Downing-street open to him, where he ought to have found all the information read
pared before he went to Paris. But if these sourcesfaiedand it is a perfect libel on the diplomatic service to suppose they could fail-had you not railroads and telegraphs in this age at your disposl? If yon could not obtain information otherwise, was it not worth while to send some one to the spot to ascertain the facts, when that which was at stake was no slight point, was not one of many pointF, but the very pith and essenoe of the whole negotiation-the cause of the quarrel and the cause of the treaty ? (Cheers.) And out of thist condition of affairs, out of this almost unprecedented blunder of our own pleni
tentiary, an excitement is got up, so that the people of England, wbho m the spring or summer expected they were going to war about Italy, now thought they were going to war again with Rusia; and yet we are told this is toenjoy theblessinof pace. Cheers.) In thiswaythespring,thesummer, and theautumn havebeen occupied. A great blunder is perpetrated by the chief of your diplomacy-not by a " poor devil" whom you could throw over the moment discovery was made, or by an unhappy underling, who you could say had been Improprly pro moted by a former Minister, and kept in his pIa through good fee, g. jHear, hear.) You would not trust your ambassador. You wisely determined on sending the chief of your diplomacy, one of the principal Ministers of the Queen and a leading member of the Cabinet, to Paris to secure that which yon were determined to achieve. He commits this awful mistake. It is not at first discovered, and he returns to this country crowned with laurels. ntis atlength discovered by your late foes asserting rightswhich the treaty itself gae them, and, instead of turning round and raying, " Neither I nor the people of England can be satisfied; let us understand one another; give that which was the spirit of the treaty;"instead of doing it in the most concliatory manner possible, every means are usedto lash up the Sons of the people of England. (Hear, hear.) One would suppose that, instead of our Minlsters having made a great blunder, our late foe and present ally had been absolutely trying to defraud us ot the consequences of our hard-earned victory, and, in order that the people of England might be prepared to enterinto the contest with exhausted Russia, who was perfectly determined not to fight, the noble lord goes down t X the great capital of industry and peace, harangues some of the mnet eminent members of the Peace Society (one of whom is no longer among us, and whose ics we sincerely deplore), and excite6them-to that pitch of enthusiasm that the members of the Peace Society half drew their swords. (A laun?.) The noble lord then says, " With such enthoslasmt will not be defrauded of my hard-earned rights. I will have the treaty executed. I will have no conference, no explanations; I will have the treaty, sbe whole treaty, and nothing hut the treaty"-the treaty which, if executed as agreed to by Lord Clarendon, would. have lust us everything for which we were struggling. (H[ear, hear ) Because Lord Clarendon makes # gross blunder the noble lord at the head of theoGovernment excites the passions of the neonle

Ruesia never would have consented to make peace had it not been impossible for her to continue the stnpgle. The noble lord the First Minister of the Crown sand, "Only have-con-

conference. At last it -oozed out that there was to be a conference, but that it was not to be presided over by the Minister of France, because he had acted perfidiously. Well, the conference was held, and it was presided over by the Minister of France. Then we were told that it-was to be m nere m atter of ceremony; that the M inisters were ineTely to com into a aroom with their boxes in their hands atnd their cooked hats, -that they wer to bow to Oach-otber, that they were toagre thattbettreaty meantwthat itdia not mean, and thatthen they-erewto leavo the room.

SirA. AG :NW assured theEHouse that itwas with very great diffidence that he roeb to second the Alddress o ably and eloquently proposed by the hon. mover (hear, hear), but, even in the short Parliamentary experience which he had ejoyed, he had always observed the great indulgence which tho House extended to members who, like himself rose, not to gratify their own loquacity, but to fulfil a neesary duty which they had undertaken. (Hear, hear.) He would bespeak, then, a full shre of that indulgenoe for hamelf on the present occasion, and though he felt how inadequae he was to the proper dischage of the duty he had to fuld, he nevertheless trusted the House would unanimously accept the Address which had been proposed. He promised that he would not detain the House more than a few minutes, and he certainly would not exceed the limit which the member for Lambeth had judiciously proposel should bo the extent of Parliamentary speeches on ordinary occasions. He would now proceed to remark on some of the paragraphs of the Queen's Speech, though he was aware he could not do so with thesame effect and eloquence as the hon. speaker who preceded him. It must have been a subject of *reat regret to all to have seen that not only great difficulties were thrown in the way of the fulfilment of the treaties with Russia, but that our great ally the Emperor of the French, who stood by us in the hour of danger and trial, seemed at the last moment inclined to give way to the demands of Rusi,w ho desired to recede from the performance of the moderate agreements which this country, after the great amount of blood and treasure it had expended, was entitled to insist on. The great point to be gained was to cut offRussia from contact with the .anubD. and thh point, notwithstanding some trifling concessions made to lussia in respect to territory, had been secured. Russia was separated from contact with the Danube, which had been rendered a great highway open to the merchant vesselsof everycountry, unannoyedbythegunboat0f Russi3 and those absurd impediments she pain the way of the free navigation of that river. (lear.) Be should next advert to the subject of NeuclilteL It might be in the remembrance of hon. mombers that in 1848 the inhabitants of lWeuchCtel threw off their allegianoe to the King of Prussia, and established a republican form of Government. This Government was acknowledged, and, notwithstanding that the King of Prussia asserted his rights, was considered almost as established; and though the Government of the day in 1852 allowed a protocol to be signed recognizing the rights of Prussia, it, however, gave him no power to act on them. The King of Pzussia, indeed, never acted on them, butin last Octobersome ofhis partisans rose and wore put down by the force of the Federal Government. These persons ha to stand their trial for treason, when the King of Prussiarempnstrated against the trial, and demanded that theys4ould be set at liberty. This was refused, and the Emperorof time French seemed inclined at one period to take the rtof the King of Prussia. At last the dispute was satisietocily arranged, NeucbMtel making the concession of settng the prisoners free; they receiving, in fact, a sort of ticret of letave, being conveyed across the frontier to the French territory, while the Governments of England and Fstnce promised to use their best endeavours to induce the King of Prussia to renounce all his rights over the State of NeuchiAeL This policy was both necessary and wise (hear, hear); for it would be quite inconsistent with the peace of Europe that the King of Prussa should put in marchl130 000 troops to seize the Swiss provinces north of the Rbine. If Prussia had succeeded in her desi'g, a principle would ha.ve been established which no politician in this country could have assented to * and if her troops had been defeated, their defeat might have been the signal for a disturbance in the whole of Europe. (Hear, hear.) Her Majesty's Government had thought it right to remonstrate with the Government of Naples, the state of whuch country was a scandal to the civilized world. (Hear.) The all ecollected that the wretched assassin Milano had jusly rfetedhislife to the law; but it was to be 'regretted that any Sovereign in Europec should add the barDabsqi of torture to the punishment of death; and Her MIajestys Goverument had acted quite right in withdrawinal1 diplomatic connexion with a onarchy which acted so unworthily. (Hear, hear.) -With regard to Persia, the Gdvermnent was subject to several pressures. It was on one side said that Her Majest's Government should be urged to act with greater courage, while another party declared that the Government ought not to interfere at a. Then there was a third party, who thought the Government shcpld be supported in their measures for preventing the Persians holding Herat. It was no visionary idea that Russia had for a long series of years endeavoured to extend the limits of her dominion eastwards, and it was evidently the interest of England to take care that Herat should not be made the basis of operatimns for a Russin army, as the British empire in thelEast might be thereby serimusly menaced. The Speech from the Throne had adverted to the importance of naintainin
our public service both at home ana abroad in a state Of efficiency. He was sure that it was a subject of very great regret to many members of that HIouse that a few person3 were coutinualy urginig upon the country the reduction of all our military establishmfents, and constantly engage'l ia adisung the country to ad.opt a policy the effect of which would be the disbanding of our armies, and the siireider of that influence which we were justly entitled to hold in the affsirs of the world. The advocates of that policy had called upon us to sacrifice our colonies rather than be ait the expense of mnairitainin,~ them, and had told us that we should rely upon an immeina militia as a means of defending our country. Thev mua
certainly not have recollected that if we d 3 wihour standing army and havorecoursetoamilitia as a means of detence, a vast number of thoee who were at prvsent engaged in the factory and the workshop would be copnpelled to rithdraw themselves therefrom from time to time, in order that they might be trained to a military life, which was distastefu* to a great portion of the people of this country; and it wa impossible to expect that these militiamen would be able to contend with the disciplined armies of the coati. nept. We should, therefore, be reduced to a second-rate, a;d, indeed, to a third or fourth rate Power. It would be presumptuous in him to make any remarks upon the leaIe reforms which Hler Majesty. had been graciously pleased to,inform the House would be brought forward during the pesnt session, as there were so many learned gentlemen in the houtse who wrould bezuile many a tedious hour by their cotament3 upon them. ae had now, as it appeared to him, adverted, but in a very ineflective manner, paragraph by

The SPXAXic having patthe Addros from the chair,
Mr. DISALIsid,-I confess,4Sir, that whenl littened to the speech of thehon. mover of the Addises-who has tonight spoken with an ability which, from the manner in which he had formerly addreased you, did not at l surprise me (cheers)-I was for sometime Inclined to believe that the hon. baronet had in his posseidon a copy of a Queen's Speech very different from that which I had had the opportunity of persuing, and which, until that moment, I had supposed to be an autheatlo document. The hon. baronet informed me that the Speech which ws.on this occasion de. livered by the Royal Commissioners contrasted very favourably with the addresse to which we have for the lst two or three years. llatene& on similar occsions. For example, that it conveyed to the Hoiue the gratifying Information that Her Majesty had received from al the great Powers ot Europe asuranoes of their cositinued friendship and goodwil; but that Is an expression which I have mot found in the copy of the Speech which ha bee placed before me. The Speech described by the hon. baronet alao promiaed to the people of this oountry, as I oaught from& his lips, a reduction of taxation. That also Is a promise which unfortunateyl ha been omitted, I am afraid from some inister motive, from the copy of the Speech for which untl this moment Iwas grateful to the distinguished person to wlhom I am indebted for it, (Cheers.) The Upoech quoted by the hon. baronet also promised a eries of measures of domestic amelioration-the necosary .consequence of our enjoyin
the blessings of peace; bat no such promise is held out in the Speech whfch I have read to-day. It Is often said that a Queen's Speech is not generAlly so instructive or so impressive a document as an expression of opinion, or a statement of fits from xach a quarter, and attended by such circumstances might naturaly be expected to be; but Iconfess that it seems to me that In the Speech delivered by the Royal Commisioners to-day there is enough to set the people of this country a-thinkdng, and to produce a very great impression upon the public opinion of these kdngdoms. It is hardly a year, Sir, sinoe-little dreaming that it was a delusive one-we lndulged the Idea that we had terminated a great. stxue, and by Its termination had laid the foundation of a prospect of peace, probably more favourable on the whole than had been offered to this country since the settlement of 1815. Let the Houe for a moment recall to its recollection the ciroumstances under which the treaty of Paris waa concluded. Our foe, deemed to be, and who hbad proved himself so powerful, had been completely baffled In the project of aggression and aggrandisement which he had contemplated and attempted to accomplsh. It has been said-I know not with how much authority-that the late Emperor of Russia had declared that he would not accede to the terms of peace whioh were at one period of the war offered to him until his last man and his last rouble were spent. To that state the Russians were in fact reduced. Great as may have been their want of the "sinews of war," their exhaustion with regard to men was still more decided. Our foe was therefore utterly discomfited and defeated, and yet he retired from the contest with dignity and without the humiliation which under such circumstances he might have been expected to experience. I know that at the timeothere were many persons who alleged these facts and circumstances as reons which should make us diapprove the settlement which had been come to, and as being very little favourable to that tranquility which we had gained at so great a sacrifice; but, in my opinion, they were eircumstances eminently favourable to the maintenance of peace. Russia had been defeated in her object. That object had been disapproved by the most eminent of her statesmen. Its attainment had been attempted in a manner which accorded with the strong character of her late Sovereign, and you may say that in the tomb of the Emperor Nicholas his policy had been interred. By a fortunate combination of circumstances, the death of the Ermperor and the heroic defence of Sebastopol at once put an end to that policy, and permitted the Rassians to see its termination without any loss of their selfrespect. If the Russians had been humiliated, if they had felt that that contest had diminished the respect gen6rally entertained by Europe for their national character, they would have been uneasy in their new position, and you might have found in that uneasiness the elements of future discord, and even the cause of- future wars; but the fact that the termination of that struggle, conclusive as It was in avour of our policy, was one not humiliating to Russis, was an additional reason that the sincerity of her desire for peace was not to be questioned, and that her in. clination and her interest were the same. (Hear, hear.) Well, Sir, looking to the condition of the two great military empires which occupy the centre of Europe, we found that probably at no period were the arts of peace more cultivated in those countries than they were even during the war. Both in France and in AuAstria great works were prosecuted, great baukinz establishments were founded, the application and distribution of capital occupied the attention of the most influential classes, and even the mitigation of the effects of commercial panics was in both countries much discu8sed and considered. Lf such were the dispositions of these empires while war was being waged, we had s right to suppose that when hostilities were' concluded they wouid prosecute these pursuits with increased vigour and determination. As to our relations with the 'United States of America, notwithstamding the squabblng and blustering which have prevai'ed upon that subject, Ishouldsupreethat no sane man ever doubted that they were deeplyand ecidedly amicable. NTo one supposed that war would break outbetween this country and Amerlca, or that the United States were about to declare war with any other great Power of Eurone. If this was the oondition of these four great Powers, wEat was that of our own country? Were we in a position which tempted us to engage in any fresh war? We had an empire open to our people such as bad never before in our history been opened to them. We were founding an immense colonial empire on a scale uulmown to the history of man, an empire of illimitable dimensions and of inexhaustible resources. We had open to our citizens a career which secures all the excitement and enterprise of war without any ot itsevils and calamities. Under these circumstances I should think that any man whose opinion was worth having would have said that, at the penod of which I am speaking, there was a sonnder foundation and a surer prospect of permanent tranquility than had been offered to this country since the settlement of 1815. That, Sir, is hardly ayear ago, and I want to know why we have been disappointed. If that view was a sound one, the country had a right to expect that we should see the consequences of such a state of affairs We had a right to suppose that Her Majesty's Ministers would have weaned the mind of this country from the excitement which war engenders, that they would no longer have permitted public attention to be diverted and distracted from the consideration of do. mestic affairs, and that well-matured and considerable measures of economical administrative improvement would have been prepared during the recess and submitted to the consideration of Parliament. (Hear, hear.) We might have looked for that which is supposed to be the necessary consequence of peace, the mitigation of public burdens (cheers), and might have expected that the capital and labour of this country would be permitted to adapt themselves with increased energies to the openings which had been made for them. I want to know why it is that, instead of a Speech from the Throne graciously holding out such prospects as these to Her Ma. jesty'sasubjects we have one which is a Speech of "wars and rumnours of wars ?I (Cheers.) With very slight exceptions, the Speech consists entirely of references and allusions to foreign transactions, and all these are transactions attended with peril and calamity, or indicative of want of confidence and trust in us on the part of fore*a Governmentsat least of misumderstanding and want of good intentions. {Hear, hear.) NTow, Sir, is this what w-as expected by Parliament and the country when they heard that on the 30th of March a treaty of peace had been signed at Pr If it be not, what has led to the existence of thisstate of affairs?
W n,Isi 4a croscrusac,an utald o
Whny, it IS a ctuiouB clcum tance, sna 1 mru-s-t-a-U-de-t-o-i-t not muerely because it is necoary to the result which I shall put before the House, but because the subject iS most markedly brought under our consideration in Her Majesty's Speech,-it is a very curious circumstance that almoit on the very day on which the treaty of peace was signed at Paris y Lord Clarendon, almost before the ink of his signature was dry, there was sown by that very negotiation the seed of new troubles and difficulties in Europe. Almost before-or, at all events, immediately after-the treaty of Paris was signed the negotiators are assmbled, and we find the English Minister doing the very thing for vhich we had denomncedltussiAthree yearsbefore (hear, hear)-upon which we bad gone to war, and to revent the repetition of which we had just negotiate a peace-interfering and connielling interference, forcible xmterference in the affairs of an independent State. Now, it is a verv remarkable circumstance that this ha
ns almost on the very day on which thetreaty was signed pRe treaty was signed on the 30th of Marhb, and on the first days of the raonth of April we findthe seed is sown for the commencement of the difficulties in our-foreign relations, of which we have had a plentifud crop ever since, and which have resulted in two instances in absolute warfLre. All these eircumstanresae of such recent ocrrence that it is qtite umneceseajt for me to enter into a wearisome narrative or exposition of the affairs referred to in Her Majestys Speech Let me recall to the recollection of the House, as succinctly as osible, what happened in regardl to the interference in-th state of Italy.-aid I beg the attentionof the llouseto datfe in this matter. It is not ,.eceary for m, to stop to inquire what we the representations of Hfer Majesty'fs Goveiument, by 'Which.
recedientsof-te-ht Sndwiset of our amesors-fortaki - that cohrse, which,.in fact, the proper and comstitutipo
-c.ue. Our sapply precedes cor way anad means. We -re not to suppose that the Chancellor of the Exchequer of this country fashions ig.demands acoording to w4kV Its say fancy Will be. received 'by the VxEouer. Be fashions his gemausids ipon the House Of or.M 3anoa by one ta, and one teat only,-the wants and
3drequfrementsofthe country. (H{er,hexr.) If the plinste lay% before the Housaeaschemne of finance and -eititatee. ch webelbeve are justified, who wlrl tell me thttherein eversHouse of Commons that refuses such _Miiihter the -ways and means that are necessary ? But I protest n our part agairst our being placed in the position
f, as- it were, stopping the supplies for expressing our optijors upon the taxation of the coantry before the 'Chancellor of the Exchequer xubmits to us his inan-cial!i statement. In asibDg the Houe to give an opinion uponthe income-tax I do not mean to imply that the ways ardineans which the Government may requirc shall be -stited. All that.I ask is that the aources of supply shall not be tampered with until the opinion of the House shall jhavo been pronounc" respecting the taxation of the country. I believe that it is of the utmtost impoitance in the present state of the public mindaxd I am the last who wil defer to anything like illegitimate agitation-that we should upon this subject came to an early dechion. (Hear, hear.) It is due to tl:e country, to ourselves, and ati moreto the hlnistry. let the hinistry know what the opinion of the House of Commons is upon this great subject,sand they maythen take that course which they in their wisdom may think proFer. I understand-for I was not in the house at the -time-that some notices hay&been given by some gentle. mnen upon this subject. I do not wish to speak of any gen-tleman in the usual exercise of his Plrliament prilege in any other than a most unfeignedly rsspectt manner; tut I think that it is of importance that it the opinion of -the B ouse is taken the question should be brought forward -by some one who undoubitedly speaks the feelings of a lrge party in tbis house. (Hear, hear.) I think the question -Cugl,t to be brought forward early I am totaly opposed toAlcking upon the Address in answer to the Seech from 4he Throfe any opinions of the House on this subject
1 think that would be an unworthy and Unstisfactory mode -of dealing with this subject. I think that it is due to the House, to the country, and to Her Majesty' Ministers that lair and sufficient, but no more than fair nd sufficent, motice should be given. I should have been glad that some ,yentlomanwhoaita near me should have undertaken the task, Dut it has been thought by many that I ought not to shrink from it, and on this day fortnight, if it be convenient and -agreeable to the Houe, I will ask their opinion upon this subjeit. I think my course will b to mnove for a committee -of the whole House in order that I may introduce resolu. tiEns. My first resolution will be to express the opinion of thin Hlouse that taxes which have been granted in time -of war for the purpose of canrying on hostilities, by way of anccme-tax, should not be levied m a period of what we are a'suredby the hon. mover of the Address is one of profound peace. (Eear, hear.) My second resolution,-of course I am mot pretending to give the language I should lay upon the table of the IouseO,-will be that the House should express its opieon that the settlement of 153 of the right nhon. entleman the member for the University of Oxford M(Mr.,adstone) should in pirit be adhered to. (Cheers.) 1 cannot but believe that if these resolutions are carried we sBhall witness some beneficial changes in the financial systgm of this country. I think we shall give a great impetns to salutary economy (hear, hear); and ehallin a most sigificant manner express our opinion that it is not advisble that England should become what is -called a "military nation" (hear, hear); though we are prepared to vote all the Ways and leans necessary to
st4IV those sources from which an effective army can at all times and in due season be raised. I am not in favour -of any new and still mysterious military system-great, I am afraid, beyond proportion, and of which we have had it
sd that it could in 10 days land an ermy on the continent. If that is the policy which the Secretary for War bas pro-claimed, and which is being pursued by Her Majesty's 3Enisters, we shall, I am afraid, check all that disarmzanent which is nOw taking place on the continent <bear, hear), and prevent that reduction of warlike establishments which in Austria and Franceis now -ccurring, and which is necessary, I will not say to the -existence, but to the best interests of those countries. (Hear, bear.) Sir, Iam not afrfd to express the old-fashioned opion that astanding army is dangerous to the liberties of ths country. (Cheers.) I know that we must have troops.' we have had an army of which every man has reason to be 'proud, and I wish to see that army maintained in its spirit -and its efficdency. What we want are seentific officers, and tbat the machinery of our inilitia shaU be nurtured and main. -tsined in efficiency. (Hear.) For the rest we may trust to the wesources of the country, which will increase in proportion -as we reduce its taxation. (Hear, hear.) I have observed with regret than an eminent person has recently spoken of the absurdity of supposing that an army can at this moment be dangerous to the liberties of this country, saying that it is no longer under the control of the Sovereign, but that 'arliament is our safeguard sgainst all possible danger from such an institution. may be permittedto say that if an army is to be under any authority I should prefer it to be sunder the authority of Her Majesty rather than under that -of the Parliament of England. (Hear, hear.) We have -ad arnies under the control of the Parliament, and we have not found the consequences of that arrangement -to be favourable to our liberties. An amy must be -either a disciplined or an undisciplined body. If undisciplined, the troops of which it is composed are bandits, like the pszetorians of Rome and others, and all we can do as to guard our properties and lives from them; but if they are disciplned tney must obey one man and that one man is the master of the State. (Hoear, hear.j I care not what may be the form of government-Royal, Imperial, or Republican, where there are 500,000 men in arms, 'bghly disicplined and obeying one man, that man is dictator. Ihope, thereore, that the 'glory of the late war, and the, if possible, greater glories of wars to come, wll not induce the people of this country to sanction extravagant military establishments. I will -express my opinion that,with due economy andwith ableadministration, the more you reduce the burdens of the neople the greater wil be your strength when the hour of danger aomes. With this conviction I shall on Tuesday, if conve. mient to the House, and if the day bo vacant, introduce the resolutions of which I have given notice. I shall therefore on this occasion not ask the House to express an opinion upon the important topics to which those resolutions will refer. It IS, Sir, with this explanation of my views as to or present position, and guarding myself from any unnecessary agreement with any of the sentiments expressed in it, that i shaU support the humble Address in answver to the gracious Speech from the Throne. (Cheers.)
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.-If the advice of the hon. gentleman opposite had been folowed in the composition of the gracious Speech 'which has this -day been read to the House, and if that Speech had contained a paragraph recommending the House to enter upon -a revision of taxation and an adjustment of the burdens of the country to the state of peace which we now, happily, -enjoy, we should have been toldthat such general assurances were of no value; that we might have assumed, as a matter -of course, that such revision would be undertaken, and that alo real information was conveyed to the House unless it was in po-seesion of the particular changes which Her M *jesty's (loverrment had it in contemplation to propose. It has rot
teen usual to make sucb announcements in the Speech from the Throne. It has been left to the discretion of the House, -when the estimates have been fram-d with a due regard to -ecanomy, to suggest the means necessary to cover the votes in committee of supply. I am not about to follow the r ght hon. gpnt'eman opposite in the wide excursion which he las made over the subject of our foreign policy, but will con-fine my attention to the remarks which he has made on the subject of the income-tax. I must protest against the House imputing to Her Majesty's Government intentions based upon the suppositions of the right hon. gentleman, -or attributing to them any such designs as those descibed in his speech. They have no wish to establish a standing army inconsistent with the liberties of the country-an army, I think, the right hon. gentleman sAid of some -D0,000 men-to be maintained out of its revenues. They do not intend to make any oonstitutional changes in -our rmilitary force. They fuly recognize the fact of our transtion from war to peace; but before it would be pos-sible for me to enter into any details upon this subject we must lay upon the table the estimates for the army and navy, and allow time for the House at least to examine -these estimates and become acquainted with their amounts. It will then be my duty to make the financial state. snent for the coming year, and to submit to the House the ways and means by which the Government propose to meet these and the other estimates for the service of the country. (Hear, hear.) That, Sir, is the course-which i; -ordinarily pursued, and I know no reason why in this session we should depart from that practice. Let me remind -the House that with respect to the current financial year, -the year ending the 1st of April next, the revenue has boen ixed by acts of Parlia-ment passed in the last session, and -the House is not called upon to make any change whicb
-would come into operation before that date. If the Govern-
mnent are to be accused of continuing war taxation during a time of peace it should be remembered that the House last seEsion, recognizing the great expenditure which -would have to be incurred in the course of this year, conse-quent upon the recent pacification, the expense of moving troops, and various other extraordinary expenses which must inevitably be defrayed during the few months immediately following the signature of the treaty, deliberately Tixed that amount of taxation for the current financial year. I am, therefore, called on to justify the existence of the present taxation. With regard to a future year, which -oromences in April next, I may state that I am not only I-repared, but it is my anxious wish, to lay the financial
atitement for the ensuinK year before the Hotie at the -earliest poesible period w¶ich the businees of the House -will permit. (Heaheat lr I believe, on some rare occaaions, the annual finaneisl tatemet bas beeh on going

'The-ns= prctice is to allow some progress to be msde h the Committee of Supply, and to make the inancil. statement in a Commuttee of Ways and bMeans, after the estimates are laid before the House. My infenticn was to take the earliest period after tbe Army and 'Navy EftimatEs should have been submitted to the House and should have undergone soln* exanidnation to make the annual financial sttement, which rould have enabled the House to judge of the pro. lIbleVpefiditure ef the eoming yi&r and of tho means

On the righthen, gentleman resuming his seat a pause ina the debate ensued, in wthich the Speaker was about to put the queston, when
Mr. GLADSTONE rose and id,-Sir, I confes3 it is with reluctance that I rise to address you at the present moment. When my right hon. friend left his seat to follow what I must call the comprehensive and remarkable speeclh 'of the right hon. gentleman opposite, I undoubtedly did suppose that we were about to hear from a Minister of the Crown some notice of and some reply to the Tery grave matters with 'which the earlier Portion of that speech was charged. (Hear, hear.) I frankly own it appears to me Inconsistent with the respect due to this House and to the country that when any member of this Hlouse supposed to I speak the sentiments of many other of its members, in a
debate on the Addree3, questioned the foreign policy of the Mlinisters of the Crown in terms so grave as thoms which bave been employed to-night, the Governyent should not vouchsafe one word of notice to the charges that have thui been made. (Hear, hear.) I was not aware, when. I entered the house, of the nature of the discussion into which the right hon. gentleman wa about to enter. I did presume-and it was an act of presumption for which-I am bound to apologize-to endeavour to catch your eye imimediately after the seconder of the Address had sat down, and I did it on the peculiar ground that I well know important considerations of finance are at this moment agitating the mind of the country (hear, hear); that I anticipated the words of the right hon. gentleman in the. feelngs of my own breast, becauseI knew there was ono man at leost in this house who was especially bound both to be definits and tbe bsprompt In explaining to the House his views on financial questions, and that I was that man, ox account of the position I held at the end of the finanolal year of 1°f3; therefore It -was my desdre not to lose a moment in acquainting the House with tho recognition which I felt bound to make of certain obligations resting on me, and resting also on the House of Commons, and for this reason alone did I presume to rise in competition with the right hon. gentleman. At a period when the speech from the Throne is occupied almost from first to last with matters touohing our foreign policy, it certainly was my intention to have adverted to several of the questions that had been ralsed; but the right hon. gentle. man, exercising his privilege as a member of this House, has entered upon a very wide field, and has questioned the foreign policy of the Government in its root and In its branches, and has made charges on that subject which the honour of the Government requires them to notice. (Cheers from the Opposition.) I again express my regret that my right hon. friend, a 3finister and adviser of the Crown. responsible for that policy, and having listened to the allegations made by the right hon. gentleman opposite, should think him-self justifiled in omitting to defend what had been forally assailed. If I understood the right hon. gentleman correctly he sid there was some instrument or compact L iu existence by which, unknown to the Parliament and the [people of this country, we hadbecome parties and guarantees
to Austria for her Italian possessns.
Mr. DISRAELI, who spoke in a low tone across the table, was understood to say It wAS Important that there should be no mistake aB to his statement on that point. What he said, or meant to say, was that during the time that Lord Clarendon had the conferences in question with Count Cavour the Italian dominions of Austria were guaranteed by a secret treaty. The noble lord (Lord Palmerston) then asked with what Power. Then he (Mr. Disraeli) said a secret tre*-ty with Franeo, but with the sanction, approba. tion, and at the instance of Engluad.
Mr. GLADSTONE.-I am very glad that I have drawn that explanation from the right hon. gentleman, because my belief is that many who heard his previous statemeat on that point received, with myself, an erroneous impression. But if it be true that a guarAntee has been given by France to Austria for her Italian possessons, with the approval of this country and with the active concurrence of this country, I must say, in my opinion, such a proceeding on the part of this country is one that ought to have been made known to Parliament (hear, hear), and may have an essential bearing on the measures that may have been taken in reference to Italian affairs. (Hear, hear.) The right hon. gentleman has said, we are not reaping the fruitg of peAce-that the Government, by perpetual quas ls, distracts the public mind, keeps up aaNsh exp editure, nd 5tops the progress of improvement at home. The right hoi. gentleman has stated, with respect to Switzerland, that at the period when Switzerland had agreed, with the aid of France, on certain terms of arrangement with Prussia, the British Government applied moral force to Switzerland, which led Switzerhud to attempt alterations of herbases and to returntothe terms proposed to her by France when she found she was unable to o tain any definitepromise of support from this country. It is perfectly plain, if that be true, that the affair of Switzerland le a very different one from thit represented in the speech from the Throne, and the Government is boundtolettheHouseknowexactyhow thematter seds The ccount which the right hon. gentleman has given, if it be correct, materially bears on the advice given to the Crown bythe Governmentinpreparing theSpeech fromthe Throne. These Tarious questions must, I fear, occupy much of the attenton of the House. I know not why, but undoubtedly for the last six months we have been kept in a state of per-
tetual disquietudebyone foreign broil after another. (Hear.) t is strange that, when the genius of the noble lord is in the ascendant, we have 10 quarrels fov one that occurs under any other Minister's reign. (Laughter.) It is strange that we should always have to break with all the world in suCcession-that in every case we should find ourselves to be unquestionably right, and should have to denounce, one after the other, the rest of mankind as either knaves or fools, and that in every case we should begin with bold and braggart language, with high-sounding pretensions, and yet, in every case, the result should be our coming down pretty nearly to the terms our opponents had offered us at fise.
ear,ii hear. I wfant to knowt how it is that thes things ti ppn, fIconfess I think there is some justice in the
fthe rght hon. gentleman (Mr. Disraeli), that, although we have attained to peace, although the people of this country have accepted peaceatsome sacrifice of feeling,
ht with a desire that it should bearealandprofound peace and bring forth its proper fruits, yet we have not seen thmoe prospects realized, and our foreign relations, together with our establishments and expenditure, are not such as can be considered satisfactory. With respect to the kingdom of Naples, inasmuch as iHer ajesty's gracious Speech we are told that the papers sall be laid upon the table, I will not now enter into any detail upon that very interesting and most important and dificult sabject, Al I shall say is this, -1, myself, have stood in a somewhat different position from other members as to transactions in the kingdom of Naples. Ihave perhaps a stronger impression of the intensity of the evils which havo prevailed m that country and of the nature of the measures whiah evils so intense might justify or require; but I did not scruple last year, while avowing nMy concurrence in the sentiments of Her Maiesty's Government with regard to what has taken place at Naples, to express my doubts and misgivings as to the policy, as to the jusUce indeed of that policy-for I can have no doubts as to the prudence and ultimate humanity of a practice of introducing for discussion at conferences the affairs of Povwers which are not represented at those conferences, and of recording conclusions in the face of E:nreo to which conclusions the Powers chiefly interested have been no parties. (Hear, hear.) At the same time I am strongly of opinion that it was for the interest of Europe that the great Powers should unite to enforce and urge npon the King of Naples the ado.ption of those messures which are requiredto establish legality and good goveMment in his dominions. Every effortwhicsh Her Majesty's Government coulduse to bring the Powers of Europe to such%a concert wold havedeserved the supiort and commendation of this House; but the question of the interference which has actually taken place is one the consideration of which we had better defer unhtl we have the correspondeuce before us, and we are able to examine into the natnre of that interference, the prospects of success by which it was attended, and the amount of authority by which it was sustained. Unfortunately, the Neapolitan question is the only one of al those matters of interest adverted to in the Royal Speech upon which, as far as I am awaae, any information has been promised us. Were it not that the Queen's Speeehes re documents framedwith grave consideration and minute care I would infer that the Omission was accidental. But there was a question relating to the Treaty of Paris, which at one time appeared to menace, a European convulsion, and wvhen discussiops and dtssensions ran so high as to exihibit England almost engaged in military action opposed to France. HEere 'was a question, the gravity of wrhich could not bce over estimated, but the settlemont of which I believe_has beenadtegeho saUsfac-
more beco ming sa Moin c my opinion beI
more becoming or more proper than the langas'e in which that result is announced in theRoyal Speec. But, at the same time, the Gotvernment will, I thin, adait that from the extreme gravity of the circumstances the agitation which pervaded the country, and the tone which the Prime Minister felt it necessary to assume-the colour which he deemed it his duty to giv o to the case, were so serious and formidable that it is right the matter should be brought authentically before Parliament, and that the fullest information as to those transactions should not be rithhold. The oharges made were too serious-the interests at stake too grave-the controversy too imenawin, to pass over lightly, and it is right we should know whethier the Govern. m enit were or were not drawn into tht cohtroversy, an d that the steps they adopted were requirod by a great and overruling necessity, in orderthat we' say give them that justification which, if they -have acted prudently, they have a right to claim at our hands. So mnuch for the question
connected with the Treaty of. Paris; but there are other I questions not yet settled, and about'which we ought to have sorne information. Moet important matters are involved in that brief paraph which refers to Anmerica. The Central Amencan question was one of those difioulties wbich during the last summer. wefo upon the hands
of tho Government which have never been wanting since I the conclusion of peace, and of which I am much afraid at the present timeit is not ossible to foretel1 the termina.

if j,riate conmunication -or the s ebjt between the Goernmentand any hoi. members. The compat I speak Of a "a" earn suadeit the table of this House, Ir the pre ce of all the memliers, and made with the people of R&lasad. The r'ghtlaon. gentleman hastrly ueferredtothe cition of the Gove*minent at that tme as,being a peculiar osition. It was not .tg in-Parlixanentary support, and Madseveral of thosexunh - yaccidents which even the skill of therighthon. member for Wedls cannot always avert ("hear," and laughter) beforstbeirAttwo orthreemonth3 of itg Ministerial existence. For several years the income. tax had been in a state moet nsatisfactory, and little creditable to this House, which bad gone on for ziotless than three or four yeats with inn5al renewals of the tax, like ehildren who do not venture to deal with the futtre, but were content with living from hand to mouth, being vnable to lay down for the guidance of their constituents any unIues or principles on which the fiscal system should rest. It was impossible, while sach a corse was adopted, that any of the purposes of income-tax could be gamed, for ant great revision of ocr commercial policy connected with re uctionx of duty absolutely required the asscrance of a revenue from the income-tax for a series of years. lUnder thesecircumstanoes, knowing the feeling of the country with res tothe uniform rate, v asked aud obtainedfrom ]?r lsent *t a time the inconm-tax had actuaUy expired the renewal of the taxwitth the uniform rato, and for a period. more than twice as long as it bd ever been given forbefore. Now, if ever thero was an act of generous confidence extended from tho Parliamens to Government it was that act, and let me do this justice to the right hon. gentleman to remark that he and his friends haring, with thodistin. guished member for Hertifordshire for their organ, tried to raise the ques tion of the uniform rate, and having found the senso of the Horse against them, offered no obstrection to the renewal of tbe tax. With respect to the Succession Duty, t'hat was stfiy andgallantly fouhltin this house; and, though there were two or threo divisions on it rathdr too near to be comfortable, yet the opposition never assumned a f actious character, andt the tax wheon passed received that cheerful acquiescenoe wshich the gentlemen of England always yield to the verdict of the Legislature. The most imlortant ground on which the proposal of tbht tax was justified was that there existed a strong sentiment in the country that theoincome-tax ought to Be laid with a heavier rate on realize4 poperty than on precarious Income; though it had been argued, and in argument never contsted, that the owners of realized property had been, without their own consdousness I believe (laughter), payig on an average at least 9d., and not 7d. in the pmoun. However, it was in consequence of the sentiment m the counitry that realized proprty was too little taxed, and precarious incomes derived from skill and labour too heavily the Government, being unable to undertake the reconstruection of the income-tax, yet undertook, by means of the succession duty, to lay an additional burden on permsnent ineomes-that is, on property. This is the settlemnent which it is incumbent to maintiin, for, though the great struggle of commercial reform is over, there yet remalnedreformsinthe tariffandCustoms dutiestobe effecte& I believe it will be perfectly practicable, If these reforms sbould be effected by means of the income-tax, then to dismwis that tax, when It has done its work, to rest. But, Sir, the pledge of the Government was given in 1853, and we received valuo for It. It referred mnainlyto something that was to tako place In 1860. Four years of the seven have passed away. It is to my mind reasonable and just that the right hon. gentleman on behalf of his friends and that every iman on his own behalf and on behalf of his constituents, should acknowledge the duty of the House of Commons to say now, in 1857, whether the pledges of 1853 are or are not to be fulfilled. (Hear, hear.) And I deprecate all schemes-except in debating societies-of comparison between diroct and indirect taxation. so far as they stand between the House of Commons and it practical duty. I deprecate thoee inquiries about a uniform and a varying rate. What Is theuseof voting aper txl incomtxbecause
ou think the rate should be varying, and then all your life long finding that you are supporting a uniform rate? Now, that has been the case practically sip to the present time. The question as to a varying rate is a question between the air and the clouds; It has never become practicable. No Minister sitting on that bench has ever boen able to devise such a rate. The right hon. gentleman announced his intention, rashly I thought, of proposinz such a rte; but he had not an opportunity of bringing it forviard. Bat there ar other matters before us that are of a practical character. As far as my duty is concerned it will be my effort and labour to secre a falfilment of the pledges giTen in 1853. (Cheers.) I understood those pledges, as the right hon. gentleman understands them. I have not forgotten them. I never can foret to the latest day of my life, and I mnust remember witt gratitude, if not with satisfaction, the conduct of the House of Commons at the period when those measures were adopted, and the generosity of the sentiments which they evinced. I must endeavour to answer that conduct, atleast, by what depends on me; and I shaU endeavour to answer that conduct by striving to bring the expenditure of the country and its fiscal arrangements into such a shape as will aslow the extinction of the income-tax in 1860. (Cheers.) The right hon. gentleman said, and I think truly, that he would not view narrowly andjealously the mere circumstance of the Government possessing a large sum of money through the accidental operation of an act of Parliament for a singe twelvemouth, if he were satisfied as to the purpose to which the money was devoted. But the right hon. gentleman is not satisfied. Sir, I am Elke him in that respect, and it is my intention to bring that matter fairly to an issue on the floor of this houso. Sir, there is another point not altogetherunimportant, in which a portion of the public areinterested, and in which I myself have a personal interest. On the Ist of April there will stiU be a half-year's Income-tax due. It is material to consider whether that half-year's income-tax is to be considered as ways and means applicable to the service of the year or not. I hope it wont be thought a piece of impertinence if I object to consider it as simply applicable to the service of the year ; I was going to say that it was my property That would be an extravagant expression, and wvoud [cad to altogether erroneous notions. But my meaning is this:In the year 1854 we asked the House toprovide us with 12,000,0001. additional taxes, which was then estimated for the first year of the war. It was necessary that we should mike provision for the first six months, during which our receipts for new duties woulid not be forthcomng. I said. wedonot proposeto borrow money for the expenditure oi the year wnile it continues on this scale; but although we do not propose to borrow money, yet as the taxes which you bave granted cannot be received for six months, we ask you to enable us to raise money by means of instruments which will hold in pawn the proceeds of those taxes when they fall due, Well now, Sir that is the purpose to which the half-year's income-tax weich will become due on the Ist of April is pledged c ad, in my audgmenti the engagements into which the Government and the House entered at that period ought to be honestlyperformed by devoting the proceeds of that haf-ear's incometax to the liquidation of the debt thus contracted Sir,I have detained the House I am afraid, too long, and much longer than I had intended; but my duty upon the subject wvasa spocial duty, and Ifeel it to boone of :so much importance to the House, and of such dee p interest to the country whose feelings are so much exdted upon it that they are hardty to be described, that the House of Commonstis bound assume its prop~er functions, to guide the country tovards right conclusions, to establish rational principles, to enforce thom at all costs, wth respect to theexpenditure of tho country and to grant to the country that relief which it is entied to anticipate. WLth respect to the resolutions of which the right hon gentleman has given notice I wish to say only one word. te will feel that the precise mode and time of nis motion must havre reerence in some degree to what has been stated by my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. But, at the same time, svhatever tbe proper time or the proper form may be, when he or any other gentleman makes a motion, having for its purpose the giving-effect to the financial arrangements of 1853, he will hnd me, as ho is entitUed to expect, among his warmest and most determined supporters (cheers), becarse I feel that I have no choice with regard to such a question; aind that it would be my own duty to raiw it if tho right hen. gentleman had not announced his intention to do so. Fidelity to thWs House and to the pledges which it has by implication given to the public render imperative the raising of that question. No doubt the right hon. gentleman, when he spoke of the settlement-of 1853, bore in mind that we haoe contracted somo .35,000,0001 or 40,000,0001. of additional debt, and that the interest of that debt must be providod for and that certain modifications of what was determined inl3 i must be made. Thatadditional debt growebon4i jld out of the circumstances which have occurred since, and which it was not in our power to foresee. Other circumstancesimay occur beforo 1860 whichmayrequire other alterationsto bemado. The prineiple to which I understand him to givo his adhesion, and to which I gve my adhesion, is this, that nothing has occurred, either with regard to the creation of new debt, or the necessity for new expenditure, which calls upon this House to depart substantially from the plodges that it gave in 1853 with regard to the cessation of the income-tax upon
ts present basis, with Its nniform ate; and that it is tbo dty of the House to adhere to its pledges, and to givo effect to them by the use of every constitutional power that it possesses. (Cheers.)
Iord PALMERSTON.-I canassuremy right hon. friend who has just sat down that if I did not rise after the right hon. gentleman opposite (Hr. Disraeli) it was in no dogree from want of respect, either to tho right hon. gentleman or to tho House. It was more, if I may say so, out of respect to my right hon. friend (Mr. Gladstone), because, anticipating that hle would state to the House those reflections and observations wbich might occur to him upon the matters in debate, I thought it moro respectful to him and also to the House to wait and hear what he might say, in order that when I rose I might bo able to mak-e
any remarks which might occur to me with referenoe to what had fallen from him. (Hear, hear.) The speech of the right hon. gentleman oppodite (Ur.Diel ) appeared t mo to be an instance of tho error into wbich men of eminent talents who distiguish themselves inadifferent lines are sometimes tempted tofall by indulging on some occasions in a display of those talents which have obtained for them eminence in another capacity.

We did accure *Ne independence of the Black Sea and the freedom of the Danube. Iasao agree with him that Rusia, although she ws compelled to submit to terms -which hae' at first be rejecteo had no reason to feel humiliated bythe resnltof the conflict. She was engaged in a war with two of the greatest Powers of Europe,-wlih England and irance. Sho fought a galant and * noble battle atilhq extreme eud of herdominions, and I think that a RulslAn might vather be proud Of the great efforts 'which were miade, by his coautrythan humiliated by the conditions which she Was at last induced by motives of prudence to accept There was,. therefore, nothing in the conduct of the war 'whiel ws not honourable to the allies, and nothing in the terms of peace which couald excite in Russia any just feelings of humiliation. But then the right hon. gentleman says that in the conduct of thenegotiations which took lacl at Paristherewag a lamentable want of geogrsphical knowledge, and that the blunders of our plonipotetitiaries cAused the difficulties. which ensued. Now, Sir, I am very unwilling to go into anything like details with respect to differences which have been accommodated. I do not think it useful to do so. (Hear, hear.) I think it would have been far better if, having been told that thess differences had been settled, and the questions at issue arranged to the satisfaction of all parties, the xinht hon. gentleman had accepted that solutiom without raking up the differences which preceded the arrangement. I will touch aslightly upon them as is con. sistent with a statement of the facts. It is w6eU knowxn that Austria began the negotiations by stating to the French and English Goverments that she was willing tosubmit to Russia certain conditions as bae of peace, provided she was assured that these conditions, if accepted by Russia, would equally be accepted by the alies. She was told that she might make the proposal. She sent these conditions to St.Petersburg as an u4matum,to beaccepted orrejected-with. out change or modification. The anawerinthe first place was a modified acceptanoe. Austria then informed the, Russian Govermment that the one condition upon which she could be instrumental in bringing about an arrangement was that these conditions should ibe purely and simply aceepted. They were so. One of those conditions was that there should be a new frontier in Bessarabia; that the line should begin at a place beyond the line calUed Choozim, that it should descend the chain to the high gronud and terminate at a place called TakeYalpuek, near the mouth Of the Danube.. That was accepted, and Russia was bound by the acceptance which she had signified. When the pleni. potentiaries ssembled in conference at Paris the Russian plenipotentiaties 3tated that, although the Emperor undoubtedly admitted that he was bound by his acceptance it would greatly soften the conditions if the allies would consent to a modification of the frontier, and they hought that modifications might be made which would stil leave untouched the principle upon which the allies bad founded their frontierviz., that Russia should be excluded from contact with the Danube and with the navigable part of the Pruth which Empies itself into the Danube. Several propositions were made which were not accepted, but at last the Russian plenipotentiaries proposed a line, wlhich was accepted by the allies. Alter its acceptance the Ruasian plenipotentiaries stAted that they wished for a modification of it; that the line went just to the north of the town of Bolgrad, which was the head-quatters of tho Bulgarian colony. The greater p&a of that district was occupied by a colony of Bulgarians, inwhom the Russian Government,take great interest. The plenipotentaxies said " Where is this town'? Let us see." A map was produoed. That map was in Russian, and no one could read it. (A lahugh.) They then asked for another. Another map was produced, and tho Russian plenipoten. tiaries were asked to point out wlhere was this town of Eolgrad, because much depended upon its geographical position. If the town of Bolgrad were so situate4 that a line drawn to the south of it would stillleavea suffiient interval betweern the frontier and LAke Yalpuck no objection would be made. If, on tho other hand, it had been found incompatible with the maintenance of the principles in accordance with whieh tho boundary line had been framed, of courso the plenipotentiaries would not have agreed to giva up that town.The town was pointod ott-Bolgrad-Tabak, and it was found that there was a sufficient interval, an Interval of four or five miles tbetween that town and Lake Yalpuck. All parties were satisfied; but when the Boundary- Com. missioners came to the country and were occupied in tracing out the plan, the English and Turkish commissioners said, "Here is Boigrad proper " but the Russians said, "No; you are mistaken; the Bolgrad that we mean is a town five or six miles aonth of that, ad therefore the boundary mnst go up the lake instead of going up the river, which is discharged into the lake." This led to a long serios of com. munications, the Governments of England, Austria, aud Turkey makintaining that they could not agree to accept the new Boigrad as the Bolgrad mentioned in the treaty, bcecause aline drawn to the south of that would. be inconsister4t with the principles on which the boundary was to be laid down. Well, the result at last ws that the Russian Government agreed to the boundary originally proposed by them, which went t) the north of Old Bolgrad; but as Russa attached iju. portance to the head-quarters of the Bulgarian colony, the Russian Government, with the consent of the Governments of England, Austria, and Turkey, obtained a small acquisition of territory, perfectly immnaterial to a country whose territories extend from the White to the Black Seas, and fiom the Baltic to the Pacific, but which included a town of sfiient capaCity to become the bead-quarters of this Bulgarian colony. The objects of all parties were therefore eventually attained. By the same arrangement Serpent's Island was admitted to belong to Tarkey, and a change was made in the Treaty of Paris. The Turkish Government attached great importance to having tho delta of the Danube under its own protectorate, and the Russian Government consented to that change being made. I have been asked whether the papers relating to those discussions will bo laid before Parliament. Undoubtedly wo shall lay before Parliament the final protocol recording the arrangements and the change made in the treaty with regard to the delta of the Danube; but we do not think it necessary or desirable to observe the same rule with respect to the various documents of which it was the result. Now we come to Switzerland. The right hon. gentleman contends that the Swiss were anxdous, on the recommendation of the French Government, to yield to the demands of Prussia; but that the English Government advised the Swiss not to yield, though -when the English Government were asked by the Swiss ihat they would do to back them, they held back and did not aid them. The facts of the case are sniply these. A search took plae and a certain number of prisoners were arrested of whom agreat many were eventually released, but the ieaders were detained for trial on a charge of treason against tho State. The demand of the Eing of Prussia was that they should be released unconditionally-and the French Government advised theamto yiell to that demand, promising them at the same time to recom. mend the King of Prussia to renounce certain rights over lNcnchftel, and leave it a part of the Swiss Confederation. We were asked to join with France in that recommendation and to promise them assistance; bat we said ie really could not do that, because, to hold out that langne to the Swiss, without any certainty that those efforts vwould be succeesful, wrould be to induce them to rely on a false presumption, and weo should be afterwards reproached with having led, themn into error. The an-
plication wasi repeaed Ihy the French Government, but again refused. we aid to the Swiss Government we could not give them any assistance in the contest between them and the Prossian Government. The ight hon. gentleman said the King of Prussia Was not actuated by any hostie intention at all itho matter, regardless that the Kiing of Prussia had announced his dqter. mination to put his army en a war footing' early in the month of January. In the meantime we were informoed by the Swiss Government that if we would join with the French Government in assurin the Swss that, on condition of releasing the prisoners without tril, we would use our efforts, concurrently with those of Prance, t persuade the King of Prussia to renounce his rights, ther would take their chance Ind relase the prisoners.. We said, "VWe will ue our efforts and nake our best endeavours, but we ae bound in good faith to tel
you we havo no, gound for reckoning upon theso effor
beinB sCessful ;" but wo never gave them the advice whico the right hon. gentleman han imputed to us
All we said was, that we could not meddle with the matter, because we bad no good ground forthat cours- 8othat what the right hon. gentleman has xted, doubtleass5rom information obtained during bis recent visit to Pin, is entirely inconsistent wvith the course which-this Government deemed jitsX duty to purauei ("HEoar," auda'laugb,).

But they were carried by gentlemen on -theatinisteris sde of the House deeply interested in real property, who did not approve ofhis measur, hut who tookit as part of a general scheme, accpting his declration that the income-tax was to terminate- in 1860. That was the equivalent and consideation -upon which the suportoed the succession duty. (Hear, hero.) Mow, if 1the sche of ithe right hon. gentleman had not been disturbod by the war two years ago we should have been paying a reduced assesment upon our incomes.

That treaty is an entiro romance (a laugh), 'without the slightest foundation except this, that I believe in the early rmeAuti should take, rommuunications pased between the Austrian ana Frenoh governme4ts; andI believe the Yrefiih Government at that tirne 'agreed that thev would take no part hostie to Austria. (Rcfar, hear.)' Well, Sir, the right hon. gentleman seigt osdrta vhjle on the one hand we were sthnualating revolutions in Italy, on the other 'we were advising and. encouraging the Frknch to undertake to l?ut them dOwn (a laugh) -an inconsistency certainly of which no Government would be likely to be guilty. The coulrse of transactionls with regard to Naples was precisely that 'which is known,, and whichi appeared in the-protocols, and the conclusionx ofwhich will be seen, by the papers 'to be laid onL the table, of the house. The'two Governments hlaving given theravctoheKn
of Naples-advice which my right hon. friend 'who spokelast seems' to aPPrOVe-and that advice1 having beenx received in a manner certainly very ubcmg.dulroing (a laugh), the two uovernment thunbeco ing andl unpotbcn
sistent with their honour to conltinue diplomatic relations with the King of Naples, anid I do not think that was any 7un-fair interference 'with the affa.ir of another State. Every country in entitled to judge as to its maintenance or cessation of diplon. atic relations, and if the two Govern. snouts thoughtt under theo circuimstances,..that it would not be becoming in them to continuLe their relations with the King of Napies, surel they 'were at liberty to Suspend them writhout becoming lIable to the chagofiporlinfering in the affa,irs of another nation. (Hear, hiear.) Now as to Persia and China. The right hon. gentlemian (Mr. Disraeli) says the ecurse of events there appeared to be the result of some syst-em predeterminecl by the Governiment at home; UndoubtedlyItwas. I1have be-enasked by myright hon. friend (Mr. Glastone) 'whether the orders for the Persian expedition were given by the Governor-Generat
upphis own authority, or whether that expdto was thpeoresutof orders irom hoe n i o heettheOrthose enters went through the Court of Directors. I should have thought that my right hon. friend 'was sufficiently acquainted 'with the arrangemnents establishedland sanctioned by Vwfor thegovernmesitoflIndia to have k,nown that orders of thae kind coming from home naever go through the Court of Directors, butt always pass through th secret comnmittee, whic is the body appoisted by the law to conduct business of that sort. INo doubt the operations were Undertaken 'upon the responsibility of Her MAjesty's Government at honme, and we do not now shrink fxom that responsibility.
Wedd consider the circumstances of the case justifiec and caled for some such prceding, and it was in consequence of orders from the overnment at home that operations -were commenced. Thenx an to its being the consequence of a predetermined system, no doubt it is so; but gentlemen opposite are parties to the adoption of that system. Does the right hon. gentleman consider that his party never adopted measures or ncted upont the belief that the safety of Berat was not inLdifferent to this countr-that it was of no importance whether 1ersia possessed that cit or not?I 1~h, when the rigvht hon. gentleman held offl;e under L,or Derby, the Persian Governmnent being believed to entertain an intention to anne- the city and territory of Baerat, the Persian 3miister of the da was asked whether such was the case, and he assured Lore Malmesbury it was -not so; but that statement being followed soon after by the intelligence of an edict from Tehuran, proclaiming the annexation to Persia of the territory and city of Herat, niotice was immediately sent to the Persian Ambassador that our relations with him bad ceasqed, and would not be renewed unless the annexationa of Berat'was withdrawn. The-Persian Governmentatlast yielded, but the course of the transactions showed that the Government of which the right lion, gentleman wvas a maember, like all other Governments wvho hold the honour of their coeintry as their first object, I elt'that the safety of our Indian possessions -was involved in the annexation of Berat to the Persian empire. In this res.pect we have followed the settled and long-established pohley of this country, founded, as I behieve, upon a right conception of the imprtance of Rerat 'with regard to the
frositier of our Igndin domainions. It was our inten-
tion to lay before the House tapers relating to this Persian affair; but within the lsst few days we have been informed that the Persian ambassador -who. has recently arrived in Paris had solicited an initerview with Lord Cowley, ourMinister in that city,and the result of that interview, which lasted some hours, was that Feruk Khan, having been made acquainted!with our demand, expressed himself desirous to eniter upon negotiations for' the settlemient of the differences which now exist. (Hear hea.
That offer has been accepted, and the matter may ];e considered as under negotiation, and therefore I think it is not flttinto lay papers before Parliament 'which maight add to fhe Lfculties of conducting this question to what we hope will be a -satisfactory settlement. (Hear, hear.) Now, as to China, the right hon. gentlepman said that 'what had occurred at Canton was also the result of a predetermiined system. Well, Sir, it was so ; and, again, who were 'the authors of that system ? The late occurrence have been the result of a,violation of the treaty of Nankin, andl under what Government wasthat treaty made? 'Why, Sir,under the G,overnnient of the late Sir R. Peel. That treaty accorded some privileges to our ships~, some immunities to our subjects. That treaty has been violated; those immunities have been bro'ken through; and the officer in command on the spot5 rightly, in may opinion, thought he was entitled to demanid satisfaction, which being refused completely and most insolently, recourse was h. d, step by step, to severe measures, in order to induce the Chinese commisbsioner to grant that satisfaction which we had a right to demand. Not only bad the British Govern. snent demaands to make, but I believe that the Government of France also lhad some demands ' and we have seen that 'the barbarous spiritwhich characteriles the Chinese commissioner at Canton has mnanifested itself by an outrage upon the flag of the United States, which compelled the naval force of that Power to have recourse to severe mneasuires to obtain reparation. I cannot help hoping, however, that in this case, too, the di ptema
be settled in a manner becoming the ralations of two Governmaents 'who cannot but wish to be upon fniendiyterm-s withbeach other. The right hon. gentleman thinks that Parliament should have been called together to ainnounce, not the outrage a-t Canton, for 'we knew nothing of what occurred there until the public accounts arrived in this country, hut on account of the intended operations against Persia. I admit, napon every consttut-ional princil that if a war takes place 'with one of the G rent VPow11ers of Europe or the United States of America,involving serious consequences,that it is the duty of the Government to call Parliament together to state the grounds of the quarrel and to ask for the mneans of carrying on the contest; but in the case of such a collision as that with Persia, a remaote country, a Power a confiit -with which is not liely to entailupon us anyvery conasiderable efforts,considering that in the natural order of things Parliament would speedily assemble, to have made that dispute the reason for especially calling it together, would realy be a very burle ue upon constitutional practice. (IIRear' and a laugh.) Slo much, then, for the right hon. gentleman's remarks upon our foreign policy. lHe says. mnoreover, that I have a jieculiar -talent for creating difflcsdties and then getting out of them. 'Well, at least one of those qualities may be set off aLgaiut 'the other. ("Hear," and laughter.) If I have a faculty for creating difficulties, and on the other hand a happy knack of getting rid of themn, I think thxose who do me the hontour to follow me cannot have much to complain of the results, (Laughter.) But if I were to consult some hon. maembers opposite they mnight possbly tell me of some genitleman who has a talent for getting his followers, into diffiLculties, but ban not the kniack of getting them out again. (Loud laughter.) I think the experience of former sessions must enable even those whose miemories are not the maost retentive to furnish somne examples. (" Hear," and a laugh.) When the right hon. gentleman says we create these difficulties thw. is a very pretty figure of speecoh, but doese her mean to say that the Giovernment of England has such command over the Governments of other countries as at will to be able to summon up diffcuties, to get them to do something outrageous or in violation of treaty, and then to require reparation, upon a previous understanding that after a certain amount of discussion. on both sides they ar to give in, anid all is to be passed over as though nothin had occurred ? Such would be the play of chilren, but such is not the way ina'which public or mnternational affairs are carried on. We are not benefited by difficulties, and if things 'are done which it is necessary for the honour of the country we should resist, and such resistance creates difficulties, we ought not to hold back, and an the right hon. gentleman1 admits we have a knack of getting through difficulties, I think the latter prt of his descrption entitles us to the commendation of the Rouse, especially as the former lart applies t-o other Power, and nobtto us. (Bear, hear.)
Ithink that every Government ouight to miaintain the anterests3 and honour of the country (hear, hear), end if the Govermtent do that successfully, and it by negotiationL they continue to smoGoth difficulties and put an end to questions -which threatened at one time to distuorb the peace, instead of exposing themselves to criticismn and animadversion, I thinik they entitle themselvesi to approbation and sup-
ort. (Cheers.) But the right hon. gentleman themember T.Or t'he University says that such is the reckless character of 'the Government of which I have the honour to be the head that we create ten timies as mnany difficulties as any other Government would create. I will not discuss arithmetic with my right hon. friend (a laugh), who is a great master of all those arts. (Laughter.)

'(ear, hear.) I agree very much with the general principles which have b'een laid down with regard to tho publid expenditure. I auite c6n. cur in the principle that irljamentbouht ffrst b decide upon what amount of establishments'the interStt and safetf of the country require, and, having settred that then to find the means by which the expense of sueh establishment,, whether large or emil ajay be defrayed. Therefore I think tho diseusions whichahave been aniounced aR to the levying of a particular tax are premature until the House of Commons shall have deided what ougl,t to be the expenditure of the country; and I must say this is the first timue I remember to have heard elaborate discussions of esti. mates which have not yet beei laid upon the table of the house. (Hear, hear.) My right hon. friend says, " Figures, after all, are what you should go by." But wait until you get the figures, for, if the Sigures are only imagined upon which you base your argument you are very likelv to find yourself in error. (Hear, hear.) We aU agree with the right hon. gentleman that it is not for this country to have an arnmy of 5C0,000 men. I do not think any one dreamt of any such thing. (Hear, hear.) It was a mere figure of speech. He meant that we ought not to have a large army, like those on the continent-an army dispropoitioned to the wants of the country. I quite agree with the right hon. gentlemin.
(Hear, hear.) I think that it would be a great mistake in any Government which proposed, and in any House of Commons which' agreed to, an Inordinate amount of military establishments bayond the requirements of the country. But the House must recollect that our army cannot be consideredin the light of a mere police force at home; that we have possessions abroad in which certain garrisons must be maintained; and although my right hon. friend says very truly that the colonies to which free institutions are given ought to contribute largely to their own expenses, yet it must bo borne in mind that In these countries, which are thinly peopled, whlere labour is dear, and where every man is occupied in some industrial pursuit, you cannot get recruits with the same facility as in a settled country; and although you may call on these colonies to contribute largely to their civil establishments, and to form militias for their defence, yet forces of that kind will not be sufficient if you have not the nueleus of regular forces on which these volunteer corps may support themselves in the hour of need. (Hear, hear.) Then you must remember that you havo a certain number of possessions abroad which require a certain amount of military force; that that military force cannot be kept permanently; that there must be troops at home periodically to relieve them, and therefore that, besides troops on foreign stations, there rmust be always a certain number on the passage out to reliev,'or on their passage home, having been relieved. All this must be takeninto account in fiing the amount of your military establishments, and you must also bear in mind that peace, however long it may continue, is not merely dependent on ourselves, but on the conduct of other Powers, end you must look forward to having a force sufficient at least to protect -you in the outset from insult or attack. Depend upon it, for a country great and rich to leave itself without the means of defence is not a method topreserve peace in the loDg raun. (Cheers.) That is why it is important to utilize the experience which we have gained in the last war, to maintain the scientific establishments, and to keep up those portions of the army which cannot be so easil1
raised as the recruits who perform the ordinary operations of a campaign. (Elear, hear.) In the same way, with regard to the navy, it was stated, I think, by the right hon. gentleman that great expense had been incurred of late years by this country (and he might have said by other countries -by France and Russia) in adapting their naval forces to the modern improvements of science, substituting propulsion by the serew for simple dependence on the powver of sails. But such adaptation IS expensive. The cost of construction of a li'e-of battle ship moved by steam is one-third greater than that of the same ship without that power, and the expense of maintaning it is one-third greater. But if other countries-if France, Russia, and the United States all adopt the system 'of steam propulsion, it will be impossible for this country to remain behind the progress of the age, and have a navy not capable by its efficiency to cope with a navy with which it might come io conflict. (Oheers.) I say, then, I tutheHseWill suspenditsjudgment on these matters of estimates and finance until they have before them the elements upon v, hich their judgment maybe formed. We have no interest iproposing to the House establishments greater than we really think necessary for the public service. We canhave no desire to create difficulties for our own administration. There is every temptation to a Government to introduce proposals most likely to be adopted bythe House, but, on the other hand, it is the duty of a responsible Govemnment, having determined the amount of army and navy which is essential for the safety and interest of the country, to present to Parliament the result of the conclusions at which they have arrived. (Hear, hear.) I think I have now not omitted any topic of importance. I regret to see that the right hon. gentleman opposite has adopted so hastily those points to which I have alluded, whiceh he picked up in Parns from the gossips of the town, and which with a little inquiry from those who would give bim information he might have satisfied himself were unfounded. He would not then have indulged in charges against the Government at variance with the facts of he case, and unfounded in reality. (Cheers.)
Mr. BAITLIE and Lord J. RUSSELL rose together. There was a cry for the latter, but the hon. gentleman refused to give way, and proceeded to say that he should not have risen but for the observations of the noble lord (Palmserston) that it would have been a burlesque to call Parliament together to announce the expedition to the Persian. Gulf. But the fact was that the order for bbat expedition was made while Parliament was sitting, without any communication being made to Parliament ; and bhus the noble lord had involved the country in war, and mad undertaken a great military expedition, without coniesoending to consult or to commumcate with Parliament in the subject. Now, whatever the sentiments or opinions Af members might be with respect to the policy of these sroceedings, operations having already commenced in the
?ersian Gulf, rarliament had now no resourco but to vote ;he supplies and carry on the war. Many persons paid very little attention to Indian wars, and, believing that they were charged on the Indian estimates, they were very lttle concerned. But there could not be a greater mistake or a more fatal error. The revenues of India were the revenues Af England, and the public debt of India was the public !ebt of England. If the revenue of India proved mnsuffiient to pay the interest of the Indian debt it must be paid by the people of this country. The misfortune of the dou'ole system of Indian government was that there were two distinct bodies-the Ministry on the one hand, and the Directors of the East India Company on the other, neither of wbich considered itself responsible for the dilapidatedconditionof Indian finance. The Affghan war was one of the results of this system, andn that war was in many respects a parallel to the present, the object in both being to counteract the influence of Russia in Central Asia. The Affghan war was the most expensive and disastrous in which the Indian Government were ever engaged. It cost 16,000,0001. sterling it involved the destruction of a large army, and it failed to attain its object. Indeed, it was now admitted, he believed, that the Affghan 'war was a gross and wanton act of aggression. For that war the East India Directors were meot responDsible. They pTotested against the war, and thoePresident of the Board of Control was compelled to threaten the Secret Committee with a nmandamus from the Court of Queen's Bench before they would send out that order. That order was issued by Sir J. Hobhouse, and it was done at the instigation of the thenSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (LordPalmerston). The noble lord was therefore mainly responsible for the Affgban war, and for the great debt that at entailed upon the resources of India. The secret history of that war had never been communicated to Parliament, but it was proved Ly the pubhcation of the Mesmoirs of Sir A. Burns that the original despatches had been mutilated to serve the purjeoses of the Ministry that commenced the war. Hme wished the Chancellor of the Exchequer bad told the House what arrangement or agreement had been made with the Indian Government for the payment of the expenses of the Persian expedition. (Blear.) The House knew that an expedition conducted at a distance of l,oO0 miles from the base of operations must be very expensive, and it could not be suposed that these expenses could be thrown upon the Indian Treasury. He would not now stop to consider whether England was moraUy justified in making war upon Persia; but it would not be difficult to show, when the proper time came, that our policy with respect to -Persia of late yearts hiad been a great blunder. He trusted thatsufcien spiit rmaind inthe ouseto vindicate Its authonty, and to question the right of an hMinister to

Lord J. RUSSELL.-I cannot regret that I had not an opportunity of addresdsg the House before my noble friend rose, because I consider that his explanation of many points with respect to which I had some doubts was fuU and satisfactory. I will, however, state to the House my impressions with regard to some of the very important topics contained in Her Majesty's Speech. With regzard to that which I believe to be the first topic in the speech, the dis-
cussions that have taken place since the signing of the treaty of Paris, it does not seem to be an unusual thing, after the signature of a treaty, that certain articles should be expressed with such vagueness or obscurity, or that they should lead to such inconvenient consequences, that it should be necessary to reconsider the wording of those articles and to amend them. But the course that was adopted-for what reason I do not know, but I suppose it was thought sufficient-was mot that which is usually followed at the termination of a great war. When belligesents had made up their minds to but a termination to the miseries of war they usually agreed to preliminaries as quickly as articles could be prepared, and after the definitive treaty of peace bad been agreed to they amended those points which were deficient. But that course had not been followed on the occasion of the recent treaty. It had been thought best that the bases of that treaty should not at all bear the character of preliminaries, and that the treaty should be baed upon thoEe preliminaries. That course was foloweed, and I do not think there could be any serious objection to reassemblng the plenipotentiaries and submitting to them and allowing them to amend the articles; The qluestion-which arose with regard to Bolgrad, upon 'whichtbo Russians no doubt had the letter of the treaty on theib aide an&wel ad its Spirit and policy on our side, led to aceonfeience, sid itipeartto meextraordinary that there should have n so much }eat andasperity Psplayed iui thb matter, When tho -vonelusion must iars appeared natural to any man of business or of common

'The extraordinary part to me of these discuions is that in the course of them so much asperity shiould have been displayed, that it should have been thought necessary to rouse this countryalmost to fover heat, and that there should have been so much intemperane- and feeling with respect to a point in itself so' simple. I hope that the recommendation made at the end of last session in Her Majesty's Speech will now, at least, be attended to by this and other countries. This is the passago to which I allude: -.
H Her Majesty trusts that the benefits resulting from the peace wll be extensive and permanent, and that while the riendships and alliances which were temented by common exertions during the contest will gain strength by mutual interests ipeace, those asperities which inherently belon to war i give place to tho confideneo and gad;-

This appeared to me to be la ngtage worthy of Her Majesty, andI have much lamented that its spirit has since been departedfrom; but Ido hope that, now all parties-to the treaty are satisfied, its spirit 'wiU be maintained, and that the asperities which naturally arose during war will give place to kind feeling among antagonists who have so much reason to respect each other. (Hear, hear.) I thought it necessary to say these few words because some persons have assumed-and no doubt falsely assumed-that those who express the views of Her Ilajesty's Government still 'speak of Russia as if she were a Power with 'which we were at war. (Hear ) Now that the purposes of Russia have been defeated and the 'objects of the war fully attained, I hope that wo shaU not only have a termination of the war but a prevalence of the spirit of pece. With regard to the question of Switzerland, I think that' my noble friend has completely explained the allegations made by the right hon. gentleman. I listened to those allegations with some surprise, as they did not at all correspond with anything I had previously heard on the 'subject. It appeared to me that the despatch, written, I be. hevo, by Lord Cowley, was exceedingly cautious, as it very properly did not commit this country to advise the King of Prussia to renounce the rights he had claimed, but at thesame time expressed that goodwilltowardsSwitzerland which it was the duty of this country to express. Bat in agreeing to the terms offared them the Swiss seem to be left in one respect in a very unfortunate position. I do not expect that the King of Prussia, having put forward these claims, will make a full and complete surrender of them, although, no doubt, they ought to be extingiished by what has taken taken 'place. The Swims
(overnment are, therefore, in this position :-if the insurgents should at any time nse in Neuchfitel against the de facto adlikewise,-asI believe, the dejure Government, and the insurrection bbuld prove unsuccessful the King of Prussia will again interfere, and say that the insmrgents have been- maintainine his rights and the whole contest will be re-opened. With regard to Persia, I have heard, with great pleasure, the annoumcement of my noble friend that Feruk Khan is empowered to propose certain terms for the settlement of the dispute. I cannot look ujon an expedition to Bushire in the light in which my no le fiiend seems to regard it-as an umimportant expedition. (Hear, hear.) I was much grieved at the orders piven for sending troops from this country, as the expedi tion, unless peace be restored, may mean much more than an expedition to Bushire. However, that expedition has been undertaken and has been successful. Every person acquainted with the country whose opinion I have heard has said thatBushire is so unhealthy after April that it cannot bo held beyond that month, but that an expedition of a mere formidable nature might be undertaken, that not less than 8,000 or 10,000 British troops might obtain. a complete command over Persia by marchinginto the very heart of the country. But an' expedition into the heast of the country is one of the utmost importa.'co, because it must have one of two objects,-either you must be going to fight Persia alone, and if you are, that country is so 'weak, so disorganized, so reduced by the vices of its Court and the character of its people, that you run the danger of altogether destroying its independence; or, you must be going to fight Persia supported by Russia; an in that case, you have a formidable contest before you-a contest which can only result in doing what I should think most dange. gerous to our empire in India,-namely, in approaching closely the real frontier of our Indian empire an dthe real frontier of the Russian empire. (Hear, hear.) I cannot believe that an English statesman, seeing the present security of our Indian empire, of which r have beard Lord Hardinge talk over and over again, seeing that in 12,000 miles of frontier there are but tvo or three points on which we can be assailed, would wvsh to extend our frontier into the very heart of Persia, and thereby to expose us to new risks and dangers, and for that purpose to encounter the evils, the immense expense, the waste of men and horses, the difficult roads, the imperfect commumications with which at pre. sent any enemy attacking our Indian possessions would have to contend. We should be reversing our position
instead of having a safe, good position, we ahould be giving an enemy the advantage by placing ourselves in an insecure position. I quite agree that it is desirable that Herat should not be annexed to Persia; but I cannot doubt that the Persian Government would assent to some arrangement with respect to that city more intelligible than the strange collection of confused phrases to which Colonel Shiel affixed his signature (hear, hear), to the effect that Herat was not to be attacked by Persia unless the Affghans attacked it, but omitting to provide for what appears to me to be the most probable case, of the possessor of Herat making incursions into Permia. I have no doubt that the Shah would agree to some fair arrangement with regard to Herat. As to the Court of Persia being inspired by Russia, I cannot believe that any Russian statesman would be blind enough to the interests of his country to engage in a distant support of the Shah, instead of, for at least the next five years, taking every
psible means to increase the resources of Russia. I eheve, therefore, that unless your termse were destructive of the independence of Persia the Russian Government would be happy to aid you in obtaining them and in terminating the war. It is not, however, enough for the noble lord to say that as this was a mere expedition to Bushire it was not necessary to call Parliament together. I think it was the constitutional duty of the Governmenthowever unpleasant it might be to them and to the members of this House, when they determined that the expedition should take place, to call Parliament together, and to lay before us the circumstances which they regarded as a justification of it. With regard to Central America I am glad to seethe course which the Government have taken. The phantomXing of Mosquito may, I hope, be said to have disappeared, and we shall run no risk of being involved with that great Iepublic, the United States, in any difference on the subject of those various tribes occupying the States of Central America who are none of them worth the lives of 5,000 British or Americans. I come nowto another subject upon which the right hon. gentleman the member for Bucks asked my opinion-an opinion which I will not withhold from him or from the House. He asked me whether, as I said last year that I was satisfied with the speech of my noble friend at the head. of the Government upon the subject of Italy, I was satisfied with wnat has since been done. I am sorry to say that I am by no meaus satisfied with what has taken place. (Hear, hear.) With regard to Naples it appeared to me thtb there were two courses which might have led to success. It might have been well for the Goveruments of England and France to make communications to that of Austria and endeavourto persuade Austria to go with them to the Court of Naples to make private communications, not as a matter to be brought before the tribunal of Europe, but to g ve friendly advice to the Kiing of the Two Sicili s, pointing out to him the danger of the course he was pursuing. it is possible that such a course might have been successful, because the authority of these three Powers would have been great, and the manner would have been friendly and courteous. There was another mode, which Lord Clarendon began to pursue, and that was saying that there were cases in which it was not only the right, but the daty of this country to interfere, and, having laid down that rule, to take care that the interference should be effectuaL I have no doubt whatever that if the King of Naples had been informed that certain terms had been agreed upon by the Governments of France and of Great Britain, and that hewas required to assent to these terms or otherwise he would be compelled to agree to them, bhe would have at once assented, because in that caselikewise his-honour-was safe. He might fairly say that he had yielded to superior force, because he would not

Now,.it wa said,-andit war paxt of the defect -of the mode which 'ws purmed-it was said that Naples was an exception to all rule and therefore it was not onlY aight, but a duty, to interfere with it. I believe that the Government of Naples wu very bad. Numbers of innocentipersons were imprisoned, Some men of the most patriotic motives and the highest characters have been for years in dungeons ; but still there are other States fir Italy whose Governmnents totally fail to perform the duties-which they owe to their subjects, and which have this additional defect-that their principal towns are garrisoned by foreign troops. (Hear, bear.) With regard to Naples, you may say that, althongh the Government is bad, it is the Government to whicht the people submit, and the general rule is not to interfere between a Sovereign and'his subjects ; but with regard to another State which I can name, the territories of the Pope, there ig no such excuse. Bad government is supported by foreigu oconpation, and every man whom I have heord speak on tho subject has said that foreign occupation is absolhtelynecessary to sustain bad government, and that bad government willUcontinub so'long as foreign ococuation endures. Ibelieve that to be true. It may be si that 'the ropk6gentati6ns':.As ti the bha government on the Pope's territory come fromn exiles and revolationists. I should in the frst place-protest against that, because tlepersons whom I have seen, some of them residing in the c9untry, and some who have left it, while among the most intellgent, refined, and well informed are at the same tim among the most moderate politicians i ever bappened to meet. But, Sir, I have obtained,' and may some day, it this question come more seriously before the HIouse, havo to read, a sentence of a ttibunal sitting at Bolognas a city wahich formore than eightyears has been in a state of siege. In that city there are-military tribunaLs, and there is piib. lisised a list of offeucee whvich they try, but besides there is *a court of crminal justice, which in a sentence dated in Junnolast rolatesthcefollowingparticulars. It states that for some years past there has been a continual course of assssinatons, of highway robberies, of thefts, amdof housebreahings prevalent in the city and country of Bologna, and that 100 gendarmes were sent out under the command of a lieutenant, who took up a great number of persons charged with vtrious offences committed at various times from 1816 to 1855a The judgment then goes into the particulars of each of these cases. It says that there is no doubt that the offences were committed, no doubt that the county has been overrun with robbery and housebreaking during all that time, and that assassinatins have been -frequent; but vwhen the Court comes to deal with the cases of the individuals, with respect toten they stae that there is no evidence against t em, except their ownyconfessions, that those confessions were extorted by torture and violence, and were retracted immediatelythosepersons leftprison. That, Sir, is the picture which a court of justice in the city of Bologna gives of the state of a country under foreign occupation, which foreign occupation is continued for the purose of preserving order in that unhappy country. ow, Sir, I ask the House whether that is a matter which is indiferent to the regular administration of government in the States of Italy. Is it poasible that for 8, 10, or 12 years we should continue to see foreign troops occupying that country, and we yet should make no remonstrance on the subject? I- c=nnot believe that if in the first place we spok-e to the French Government, and if, acting in concert ,vith themi we remonstrated in the next place with Austria on this occupation,-I cannot believe that the same evils would continue. No doubt, as I have said, the vices of the Government of Rome, its corruption, its total abandonment of the duties of punishmg crime, its entire negligence with regard to the protection of its subjects, wifil continue as long as this foreign occupation lasts. But I have no doubt if a day were fixed -say, as the occupation of the Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia is to cease on the 30th of March; that in six months afterwards the occnpation of the Roman Legations by the Austrian troops shal cease-that measures would be taken to have a tolerable Government in that country, and that there would be some chance of an independent State 'here. I say there would be some chance of an independent State there, because, although many of those whom I know are very confident that thePope,wbose benevolent intentionsno one doubts, can adopt such precautions as will establish good government, I am myself by no means sanguine that such an attempt on his part would not fail, and that it mnight not be necessary for the Powers of Europe to consider the question as to the sovereignty of those parts of Italy. (Hear.) This is a very large and grave question, but I feel quite sure that such a country as Italy-a country so endowe(a by nature-a country po3sessing inbabitants of so much intelligence-should not be left in the state in which it at present is owing to foreign dominion. I av " owing to foreign dominion," because, although Austria has no right to govern nore tban 3,000,000 out of the 25,000,000 Italians, yet, partly by treaty, partly by the march of her armies, and partly by her ini uence, she has since 1815 governed nearly the whole of Italy. (Hear.) It is but of late years that the Government of Piedmont has released itself from that influnnce. That is now a Government worthy of all admiration (cheers)-a constitutional Government promoting hberty of conscienco and of speech -and Piedmont is now a country where rnen who are driven from gaol to goal in other parts of Italy find at length a safe refugo. (Hear, hear.) I believe, Sir, that if the Government of England will take up this question in earnest-if they wi consultwith the Governments of France and of Sardinia upon the subject-there need be no danger whatever of war. I believe that the general feeling of the Italian nation, coupled with the declaration of agreat Power like this country, would be sufficient to make Austria confine herself to that which is her proper and just dominion, that to which she is alone entitled by the treaty of Vienna, the government of Lombardy and Venice, and no one wil rejoice more than myself if, by an improved and altered system of government, by adopting clemency in the place of rigour, by adopting justice inthe place of injustice the Emperor of Austria should come at lengthtoreign really in thehearts of his Italian subjects. But I am sure that the present state of Itnly is a danger to Europe as well as a misery to the Italians, and therefore I hope that we have not come to the end, when we are told that to the King of Naples was given good advice, but he would not take it, and that therefore our Minister was withdrawn.
]" ear," and a laugh.) I believe that not only asples, but Sicily also, is in a state of great discontent. (lear, hear.) It may be possible by means of Swiss soldiers to put down any insurrection in blood; it may be cossible also in the Roman Legations by means of the foreign garrisons there to suppress any revolt ; but if we, at one time by encouraging them, aud at another time by withholding support, drive tho people of Italy into that state of desperation which leads them to make fruitless efforts to Improve their condition, and the country thereby becomes in a worse state thau before, I think a heavy responsibility will lieupon the Government ofthiscountry. (Hear.) Ibebelieve the time is come when Italy-not in one republc but noting through her several independent States-is to piay a great part in adjusting the balaice of power in Europe, and if she, along with other nations, takes that part in moderating the amabition of great Powers, her thralled literature wiU revive, her thrailled commerce will extend, and it will be indeed a triumph for the Government and people of this country if such a result is accomplished through British influence. (Cheers.) The only other remarks I will make are upon the subject touched upon at some length by my right hon. friend (Mr. Gladstone),-namely, the question of estimates and expenditure. I wil not attempt, of course, to go intoanycalculation, but I dohopethatmyrighthon. friend the Chancellorof theExchequerwviltreconsiderhisdetermination, as expressed to night, and that he wiiU do as Sir R.Peel andothers avedonein asimilar case,that is, bringthestate of the finances before this House at a very early period of the session. (Cheers.) Letus know what the estimated expenditure is, what are the ways and means to cover it, what are the intentions of the Government with respect to the taxes, and let this House judge of them. (Hear, hear.) I am sw e that such a course would be far more satisfactory than any motion made by a right hon. gentleman opposite or any person out of office on the subject of taxation, without our saving fully before us the proposed expenditure and the reasons upon which it is founded. This House, I am sure, IS always disposed, if it can, to agree with the Chancelor of the Exchequer, and no one found more than my right hon. friend (Mr. Gladstone) that the House of Commnons is always inclined not to make the finances a matter of party discussion, but, if possible, to act in such a mauner as to maintain the credit of the country and support those establishnients which are necessary for its defence and security. With regard to what those establishments should be, I will only say that I quite agreo with aU that my noble friend (Lord Palmerston) hat said upon that subject; and perhaps if I might venture to recall old times and refer to what he said the first time I made a motion in this house, which wasin 1816, when I asked the Ministry to withdraw the estimates and propose reduced oneS, and my noble friend, then Secretary for War, etatedthe grounds why considerable estimates were neces3ary (laughter), I might observe that the reasbns he then gave were not verydissimilar from thoseowhich he offered to-night, and I have nO doubt were perfectly well grounded. All I should wvish to prevent, as far as my vote hies, would be tho adoption of any new system with reoard
to our naval and military estimates. (ear, hear.) We have been accustomed (and very gMat Ministers-Ministers who knew what the country required-have sanctioned the practice) to keep up low establishments in time of peace; and though there has been always a complaint in the first year of war that we have been very unprepared and have not made sufficient provision for a period of 'war, yet, somehow or other, after a time, we have generally found ourselves strong enough to meet our enemy with the estalilshmentwe possessed. Moreover, though the complaint I refer to has been made very recently, arising out of the events of the late war, I do not think- that our experience during the las 30 years is at all adverse to the plan pursued. We have seen in FranceI believe almost ever since the accession of Charles X., and certainly since the accession of Louis Philippe-that that countfy has been maintaining an immense army and a considerable navy, and every year increasing itS debt. (Hear, hear. W e, on the other hand, have been keeping up estabUshments thought by some
,ersons too great, but which were, in fact, not very. considerable; we have thus been enabled to secure a surplus revenuei to reduce taxed, and abolishcustoms' duties which pressed upon the energies and checked the: industry of the peopl;we have enabled our population to grow rich; and we hbieseen in the last war what -that wealth was abi to effect, for when our enemy was exhautedand our ally was so farweakeniedin itsfinancesethatits war spirit'flagged, the Government of this country found that, owng to our wealth woe had more than sufficiert to pay for the-large expenditure of the war, and the spirit of our people,. if terms of peace had not been acoepted, was such that for five; six, or ten yers longer, -if necesary, we might-have made the exertions necessary for wa,r.-- (ear, hear.)- -Now, theae are the thinga which produce good termnuations of wxrr, and not large andw expensive eatablisbiiients,wlFtb generals arid admirals grow. ing-so old that Ihey are unfit for their duties wrhen -iwar comses. -(A' ea, hear," apd- a -laisgh) It Is by.nmoderate *stahlishments, by rendering such establishments good and

|Mr. f. GIBSON thouglitthlat the noble lord was a littfl
Ea nguine in hoping that fnandial questions would be dealt Iwith ithout reference to par.. He should have imagined that the recollectibriof the nobloe lord would have told himi ithat the quegort of finance was one upon which Govern.
npents hao frequontly been ahipwrecked, and it was, in point of 'act, on questions of finance thit the confidence If'the Honse of Cotnmons was more particularly tested, and if he had rightly understood the observations of the Chance,lor -of -the Exchequer he thought that a question of finance was a rock a-head of the present Government. The inght hon. gentleman the member for Oxford University Lad prediced that from 23,0001,0001. to 24,000,0001. *would be asked for the arm, ' navy, and ordnane
departmentg as the peace establlshment for this country. If that prediction should prove true the country would not supkorttheGovernment. (Hear, hear.) As regardedthe foreign policy of the Government, as there was to be no division upon the Address,he feltbound to enter his protest against such parts of it, referred to in the Address as he could not approve. With regardto Persia, it wassaidthat negotiations were going on, He sbould like to be informed how long they would last. Questions will be put to Government which will be met with the usual ofl;cial reny
we can tell you nothing because liegotiations arependng. For himself, be was sick of the very word negotiatio
(HeLr, hear.) The noblelordhadomit e* to replytothe most rmportant4uestions put to him by the rght ion, member for Oxford university. One of those questions-nd a very material question it was-was who was to pay for the Persian vwar. Were the English people to pay for the Persian war, either in whole or in nprt? That was a plain question, and the Horse was entitled to hearananswertoit. Then,again,the Houseought to be told whether the war had been undertaken by the Governmnent w.ith the consent of the secret committee of the Cotrt of Directors. He would not at present express anyopinion on the Persian war, but he did hopo that the negotiations would not be long protracted, and the public mind disturbed by all kinds of contradictory reports, which would distract attention from domestic affairs. With regard to Naples, he should like to know whether the demnands which had been mado upon the King were such as this country was entitled to make, and if the King of Naples was entitled as an independent Soverei to refuse those demands. The noble lord hl stated that the communications were friendly communications, but yet there had ensued a suspension of diplomatic intercourse with that country. For his own part, he should wish to seo a cessation of those friendl communications to foreign independent Governments. The noble lord tho Secretar for Foreign Affairs had said at Paris that the object to bde esired was to repress revolution and encour"e a mnonarchical spirit in Italy. Now, tho King of'\aples no doubt thought that his way of supporting the monarchy was the best way, and why should we interfere with the internal government of the people of Italy? He believed that the cause of humanity and liberty wouldbe best promoted by non-interfereiice, and for the sake of liberty in tlWy that England hiould cease to interfere in her internal affairs, for when she did interfere it was only to betray and to excite expectations which she took no further steps to see fulfiled. With regard to China the House was called upon to sty that the pertinacious refusal of redress on the part of the Chinese Government had rendered it necessary for Her Majesty's officers in China to have recourso to force. Nolw, he had great difficulty in coming to any such conclusion, and he thought that that part of the Address ought to be Altered, and if it vwas intended to imply that in the opinionof the Housethe forciblenmeasures wrhichhadbeen adopted in China had been rendered necessary he should feol greatly inclined to move the omission of that part of the Adaress.!How coulditbo said that these measureshad been taken with great' forbearance when a lirgo and populous city bad boon bombarded, aDd the people, if the Chinese accounts were to be believed, destroyed in unknown numbers? It therefore appeared to him that the word forbearanco was very much out of place. Instead of forbearance hb thought there had been displayed a rashness and thoughtlessness as to the fearful consequences of bombarding- a large and populous city. It was impossible to discuss the details without full information;but betthought the House should not be asked by such ingenious language to as a direct approval upon the policy recently pursued. Be had never known suc a Royal Speech made to Parliament since the reign of the four Georges. There was carcely a word about domestic policy,-as if England had no domestic policy. There was nothing in the Speech but "wars and runmour of wara." Everybody was described as contented and happy, as in the good times of George IT.; and " the resources of the country," it was said, "remained unimpaired, and its productive industry continued unchecked in ite course of progressive development." This was an exaggerated statement of the condition of the country. Ho denied that it could be stated with truth that there existed general wellbeine and contentment. There was displayed throughout the lengtiand breadth of the land-not merely by the poorer classes, but by theaffauent-theatmost impatience at the amount of the public burdens; and were there not daily seen in the metropolis large gatheringiof unemploved workmen? When they regarded the amount of pauperism and crime, how could the Ministers deliberately describe, in the Royal Speech, the whole country as one paradise? He saw no mention in the present Speech from the Throne of the intention of the Government, announced in the Royal Speoch last session, to carry out the recommendations of the commissioners who inquired into the local dues on shippin in the different ports. The measure ws abandoned ast session for want of adequate information; then a committee sat and information was supplied to the Government; and yet no allusion to this raost important subject is made in the opeech. There was no allusion also to the important
nestions of publio education and Parliamentary reform. e had never heard a Speech from tho Throne with greater regret, and he contended that they wero entitled to expect at the hands of a Government professinr to be at the head of the Liberal party, after the termination of the Russian war, broader and more comprehensive views expressed on omestic polcy. He trusted that, after what had been said on both sides of the house with respect to the military establishments, that tho Peace Society, as it was called, or peaceo party, would no longer be sneered at, for it appeared the sentiments expressed bv the zight hon. member for Buckinghamshire and the rigOht hon. gentleman for Oxford University, as well as by the noble lord the member for London, were pretty nearl the same as those expressed by the gentlemen supposed to form the Peace Society. He hoped that when the figures were laid before the Houso it would be found that they were to bave a boud jide peace establishment, and not an etablishment intended for aggressive warfare.
Mr. HADFIELDsaid, he had prepared an amendment, which he should now postpone to another period, with reference to tho production of the rawmateria for our cotton and silk manufactures, He contended that a great amount of raw cotton and silk now imported from America and China might be supplied by India.
Mr. VERNON SEITH said, he did not expect that tho growth of cotton in India would have formed one of the imany subjects to which the attention of the House had been called that evening. All that he could tell his hon. friend was, that the attention of the Government had been paid for some time past to tbo means of increasing the growth of cotton in India. Since the committee which eat upon the subject in 1848 there had been a steady progress in the growth of cotton in that country, The best meams of increasing its growth was to secure for it a ready sale in England. It was perfectly well known that the cotton of India was inferior to that grown in America, and that it was only resorted to when there was a deficiency in the supply from America. But he did not deny that the Indian cotton wvas capable of considerable improvement. Mtachinery had been already sent out to India by which the improvoment of the cotton was greatly facilitated and its supply made more regular. The committee which sat in 148 reported that no great improvement could be effected with respect to Indian cotton until the means of transportvworeincreased. His hon friend was perfectlyaware that since 1848 great additional railroad communication had been provided in India, and he (Mr. V. Smith) confidently hoped that it would be the means of improving the cultivation of cotton in India. The people of Manchester asked the Government to guarantee them againstloss if they should undertake the growth of cotton in India, but he should like to seeoits growth developed, not by Government guarantees, but by private cuterpnXc, and be hadno doubt that that enterprise would be well remunerated. Ho wtould be happy to receive any COmmuniCatiOns from his hon. friend on the subject.
SirJ. PAIXNGTON asked Lord Palmerston whether he had any objection to alter that portion of the paragraph in the Address relating to China which expressed an approval of the late meumres which had been resorted to a..inst that country, as he (Sir J. Pakington) felt no hesitation in sayimg that he had the greatest objection to being committed to anapproval of them? (Hear.)
Lord PAL1ER STON said, ho would consent to the introduction of such words as should not be open to the objections of the right hon. baronet.
The Address was then unanimously agreed to, and the House adjournied at half-past 12o'clock._

LONDON, WEDNESDAy, PBBEUARY 4, 1857.
At the reassembling of their Lordship;, at 5 o'clock, IIn MAJESTY'S gracious Speech having been read by the LoBD a E ,
The Earl of CoRI; Tose to move the Address. After briefly referring to the success which had attended the diplomatic efforts of Hn MAzJxSrW'S representatives at the Peace Conferences, and mentkning in tenns of congratulation the failure of the attempt to disturb the peace of Europe .by the NeachUtel ireide, his Lordship proceeded to refer to the Persianwar. That extreme ,tephad been forced upon HER MAJEsTY's Government not only by Persies systematic duplicity, btit by the recklmess spirit of aggression which had characterized that State'a attack-tipon the city of Herat. Tho despwches which had recently. arrived showved the vigoaiid success with whibh HER MAJSx's Government had punished this uijust intraction of their international .treaties. -To- alMost the tame -causes,
and the exclusive -spirit . of the people, the_dis. putes*ith the authorities of Cautoll might be .trAced.- Ini.-pitU-6f the heavy t4xitioif which had prelIed upon the r,esources of this ldugdomn 'their .todshps.ubtba Ladtoobserve the general i,ndus*., trial proOperity which prevailed,and iwbich WMin-: dicbted-by4he eX'poxt returnls. - Hacouldsxpe*k inSore -
psrticuiIar1y'iitIu regard to the sistet'couttrys writlvwhich he was immediately connected, and whiclh
Phovved a greater diminution of the poor-rates than had existed for some.tine. past. His Lordship con~clu~ded by moving the Address in reply.
The Earl of AiRLrE seconded the Address. and Was underNtood to recapitulate the various points touched upoa in lix M&EsTjy's gracious Speechi.
The Earl of DaRBY regretted -that he could not agree with thb encomiums which had been lavished upon, the Speech' which HEa. MA-
xsrs'aiadvizers had presented to Parliament. It Was, in fact, most vague, shadowy, and unsubstantial. The reference to the other House of Parlia-
aent- was meagre, and unsatisfactory in the last degree; ia fact, they were merely requested to make - the formal financial arrangements which mnight be necessary for the public service; but In making those arrangements he thonght Parliament 'would be wanting in its duty if it did not demand the fulfilment of. its solemn pledge, that the Incometax should cease and determine in 1860, and on the faith of which the public had consented to its imposition. But, meagre as was the Speech, it did not contain that formerly well-known paragraph in which the Sovereiga congratulated the Parliament on the steady maintenance of peace. On the contrary, now the only Sovereign so alluded to 'was the King of SIAM. The other parts in the Speech were almost equaUy unsatisfactory. It was mentioned with much satisfaction that in concert with our august ally we bad put the NeuchUtel question in a fair way of being adjusted, whereas he quite believed that if we had not interfered with our august ally at all the whole matter would have been settled more speedily and amicably. But Lord PAi_7xmsrox had such a peculiar, skill in getting out ef c difficulty that he seemed to seek such situatons. Turning to another portion of the Speech 'which referred to our relations with Naples, did this country, he asked, always act uprightly? Did it never keep the " promise to the ear and break it to the hope P' Had we not played wvith the question of Italian liberty, while the principal result of the Paris Conferences was to make the Austrian rule In Italy more fixed and more permanent than ever? What was the object and what result had been achieved by the Neapolitan difficulty, except that England and France had received at the hands of that petty State a deliberate and well-deserved affront? He certainly believed our policy of late had deprived this country of every friend in the 'world, except France. After dwelling at length upon each step which had produced the Pernian war, he proceeded to comment upon the con-
duct of the G$overnent in not calling ParliamentI together when that struggle became inevitable. It 'was useless to call it an Indian war; it was British and as such should have been declared by the So-
vereign of this country, with the consent and ap-I probation of the Parliament. But such remarks applied with still greater force to the proceedings in China, which had filled him with amazement. Was the bombardment of the great commercial city of Canton,-the indiscriminate slaughter of innocent and guilty in one common doom,-an act of forbearance, as it was termed in the Speech ? He confessed he could not look upon the state of our foreign relations without distrust and misgiving. If he did not then move an amendment to the Address it was in the hope that the opinions which he now nndoubtedly entertained would be modified by reading the protocols which the Government were of course prepared to lay before their Lordships.
The Earl of CilunrwDoN was sorry that Lord DanBY had not adhered to the usual practice, and rerained from any allusion to foreign topics until he was in poesession of the. full information 'which would shortly be laid before the House. Had he waited for these documents it would have saved him from the erroneous impression he appeared to entertain with regard to the Neuchittel question. Neither the English nor French Government was concerned in any way with the resistance with which the Swiss Government had met the demands of Prussia. It was, indeed, true that HER AfsrEY's Ministers had taken advantage of the Paris Conferences to consider the question of the state of. Italy,. but the course which they had adopted in conjunction with the Emperor of the Fnrmcsr had met with the cordial approval of the principal Governments of Europe. With regard to the Persian war, it was very far from being the groundless quarrel which the public seemed quite to believe. The capture of Herat, a city of much importance, and surrovunded by a territory of unexampled fertility, was one which could not be regarded with indifference when such a conquest threatened at once the neutrality and independence of Affghanistaif, both of which were necessary to the security of our Indian empire. He regretted much to hear the terms in which lord DanBy had spoken of the conduct of the English authorities in China. The course which had been taken there was one which had only been resorted to when all other steps failed-when, in fact, the refusal of the Chinese to hold communication with our officials had left the latter no other remedy.
Earl GREY said he could not characterize the war with Persia as other than unjust and impolitic. It could scarcely be contended that we had the right to dictate the course which an independent nation should pursue in vindicating its interests. Yet such, in fact, was the right claimed by this country in the quarrel between Persia and Herat, without our Government even taking the trouble to ascertain which was in the wrong. If it was the bugbear of Russian influence which our Government professed to dread, the late war showed to every man of sense the groundlessness of suich a plea. At the same time, while fearing Russia we seemed as if bent on working out her ends, for 'what was more likely to throw Persia into the arms of that Power than the present unjustifiable invasion of her territory and destruction of her little standing army? To counteract Russia, Persia should be strong and attached to oiur alliance, and not forced into regarding us as her most dangerous and subtle foe. Ministers sought to evade responsibility because they had made no formal declaration of war. But this was far from excusing them, and if Parliament was to maintain its authority over the advisers of the CROwN it must not pass over this omission. Lord GREY concludeed by moving an amendment, to the effect that it was the duty of HEP MAJEsTy's advisers to summon Parliament together and inform them of the state of affairs with Persia before declaring war.
Lord GRAN-virLE replied, and defended the course 'which the Government had taken in the negotiations with Persia, and in the declaration of war through the Governor-General of I.NDiA instead of at home. Though H3EE MAAEs's Government were quite prepared to meet Earl GREY upon any question he might raise, he trusted that the noble }arl was not serious in pressing his amendment at the present jincture.
Lord BROuGI.Am spoke strongly against the further continuance of the Income-tax. In 1816 he, in conjunction with Mr. BARIIG, made a reduction of 6,000,0001. or 8,000,0001. in the amount of the Income-tax, upon which the CRANCELLOR of the ExcBEQUER withdrew his estimates and framed new ones, on the principle of cutting his coat according to the cloth. His Lordship then reverted to the necessity for a- legalreform, especially in those laws relating to secondary punishments.
The LoRD CHANCEuLOR agreed with what had faOlen from the noble and learned Lord as to the
necessity for law reform. He had himself given, notiece that eveningof hisintentionto bringforwardat an early period three biUs for thepurposeof amending the laws relating to marriage and divorce, testamenTry jurisdiction, and ecclesiastical law. In the other House a bill would also be brought in to meet those crimes of breach of trust such as had lately shocked the public confidence. His Lordship concluded, after indicating several other reforms of a similar nature to which the Government intended directing their earliest attention, among others a bill which would be brought in by Sir GEORBGE GB , having peculiar reference to secondarypunishments.
Earl GREY'S amendment was then put, and their Lordships divided, when there appeared,
For the amendment-
Content. ... ... ... 12 Nobt content ... .. ... 4-o
qlfajority against the amendment ... -33 Their Lordships then adjourned. In the House of Commons,
The Addre.s was moved by Sir T. RAMSDEN who
reviewed the principal topics touched upon m the Speech of the Royal Commissioners, noticing the omimion of any reference to our convict and criminal population, and expressing a hope that the House would be speedily called upon to record its 'pinion respecting a state of things which, he said,
was as disgraceful to the .Legislature as it was grievous torthe community.
The mnotion was seconded by Sir A. AGEsEw.
Mrr. DISRA&U, after a passing allusion to. the omissions in the Royal Speech, dezcribed the condition of the great Poweis at the termination of the late struggle as affording a fair prospect of permanent tranquillity for this cotmitry; and he wanted to know, he said, why .we were disappointed of this expectation-why wars and rumours of wars should pervade the whole Speech? He proceeded to argue that the seeds of difficulties in our diplomatic relations were sown immediately after the treaty of peace; first, with reference to Italy, our intermeddling with the affairs of which country had, he observed, for six months diverted the mind of England from the consideration of its domestic interests, at that very time a secret treaty being in existence guaranteeing to Austria, with the assent of the British Government, the whole of her Italian dominions. Was a Minister, he asked, jtustified in holding out to Italy and to Europe, under these circumstances, that he was determined to chanee the aspect of social and political life in Italy? lie insisted that this was an imposture practised upon the people of this counthy while time 'was wasted and expense unnecessarily incurred. Then came the Russian difficulty. What, he asked, was the reason why we were on the point of losing one of the very objects for which we went to war? He contended that it was owing to a blunder of our own negotiator, who was a principal member of the Cabinet. Yet, instead of an avowal of the mistake, every means were used to excite the passions of the people of this country against Russia, as if she desired to recede from the treaty. All these difficulties in foreign affairs, which occupied nearly a year, were attributable, he argued, to Ministers, who, when the question about Bolgrad and the Isle of Serpents. was adjusted, had advised a course in the Neuchltel dispute, calculated, butt forthe prudence of the Swiss, to involve them in war and to embroil the Continent. Thetranquilityof Europe was, however, so well established that even a firebrand MIinister could not subvert it; but in another quarter of the globe we had, not rumours of wars, but actual war, and he thought it was the duty of that House to inquire what was the cause of these perpetually recurring difficulties. Recolecting the case of the war in Affghanistan, he should, when the papers were before the House, scruttinize very closely the real causes of the war with Persia; and, with regard to the Chinese difficulty, he believed it was the consequence of instructions from home, unt out some time ago. The House, he thought, would do weU to curb and control the power of the Minister to pursue such a system as he had sketched, so dangerous to the interests of the country. Turning his attention to domestic topics, Mr. DIsiBAnr adverted to finance, and especialy to the income-tax, pointing out some of the embarraing questions which would arise if the settlement of 1853 were not adhered to, and the importance of coming to an early decision upon this source of supply. He intimated his intention on that day fortnight, to ask the opinion of the House upon this subject, by moving for a committee of the whole House, with the view of proposing certain resolutions.
The CHAxczcEoR of the ExCimEQuna, declining to follow Mlr. DISRA into the wide field of our foreign policy, replied very briefly to his remarks upon the finances of the country. As to the future year, it was, he said, his anxious wish to lay his financial statement of the probable expenditure and the means for meeting it before the House at the earliest possible opportunity.
Mr. GLADSTONE expressed his surprise that the CHANcELoa of the EX%eomqnmR should not have noticed and replied to the allegations made by Mr. DisRAELI on the subject Qf our foreign policy, some of which were definite enough, sndwhich, if correct, bore materially upon the advice, given to the CRovwN by its Ministers. He thought there was justice in the statement of Mr. DIspR,r thst, although we had accepted peace, and wished it to be real, its fruits had been but partially realized. He noticed the absence in the Royal Speech of any promise of information respecting matters of importance,-the question which arose respecting the treaty of Paris, the settlement of the Central American dispute, and the Persian war. He should have been glad, he said, if the unhappy events in China had been noticed in the speech in terms somewhat different; and, -with regard to Persia, he wished to know by whose authority that war had been waged, whether the expedition and its polcy had been approved by the Court of Directors of the East India Company or whetherthat body was onlythe nommnal authority. *He wanted likewise to knowr at whose charge the war was to be carried on. If this country was to bear the charge, or any part of it, then it was the duty of the Government to have called Parliament together atan earlier period. Leaving questions of foreign policy, Mr. GLADSTONE adverted to the paragraph in the Royal Speech relating to the Bank of England, protesting, against its being understood to import any foregone conclusion as to the precise terms of the renewal of the act of 1844, considering it to be completelyopentoParliament to consider if that act be not capable of improvement. With reference to the income-tax, and to the agitation against the tax, he earnestly desired, he said, to bring the minds of the people of this country to a consideration of the question, which must be first disposed of, as to what was the just and reasonable scale of expenditure. If the 9d. tax were given up without an equivalent reduction of the estimates there must be either new taxation or a loan. He would not be a party to either; he felt it to be his bounden duty to lay hold first of the expenditure, and to battle with the estimates. He fully admitted that the arrangement of 1853 was of the nature of a compact, in conjunction with the succession duty. It was fair, therefore, to raise the question whether the pledge should not now be fulfilled, and it would be his endeavour to secure its fulfilment.
Lord PAMERSTON, observing that Mr. DISRALI had displayed talents in the composition of works of imagination, pronounced the greater part of his speech an entire romance. He detailed the course of proceeding which resulted in the treaty of peace, and the history of theboundaryline, contending that the misunderstanding as to this line had originated in no want of geographical knowledge on the part of the British Plenipotentiaries. It was not desirable, he thought, that the papers relating to these differences, which had been arranged, should be laid before Parliament. He explained and vindicated the course pursued by the Government regarding the Neuchftel question, denying that they had given the advice to the Swiss alleged by Mr. DisRnLr. As to any treaty guaranteeing to Austria her Italian possessions, he was totallyignorant of tho existence of such a treaty; and, so far from advising such a stipulation, had this Government been consulted as to such a treaty, their advice would have been adverse to it. With regard to the operations against Persia, they were undoubtedly taken on the responsibility of Han MlAJEsTY's Government, the circumstances of the case, in their opinion, calling for and justifying them, in conformity with a policy founded upon a right conception of the interests of our Indian empire. Within the last few days he had been informed that the Persian Ambassador at Paris had solicited an interview
with Lord COWLEY, and had expressed his readiness to enter into negotiations for the settlement of the question. It would not, therefore, pending this negotiation, be expedient to produce the papers. The operations against China had been the result of a violation by the Chinese of the treaty of Nankin. He hoped that this dispute, too, would be speedily adjusted. Having replied to other objections put forward by Mr. DISRAELI and Mr. GLADSTOME, he expressed his concurrence in the principles laid down by the latter, that the scale of public expenditure should be first fixed, and then the means should be provided for defraying it. To discuss this question, therefore, before the estimates were prepared was premature. The Government had no interest in proposing establishmentsgreater than the public service required, thereby creating Parliamentary diliiculties.
Mr. BAiuE strongly condemned the expedition to the Persian Gulf which, he observed, had been determined upon while Parliament was sitting.
Lord J. RusLL, observing that the explanations given by Lord PALmIrsrow upon several points had been full and satisfactory, expressed his regret that so much asperity had been manifested respecting the misunderstanding onthe subject of the article of the treaty defining the boundary line. After a few remarks upon the NeuAchtel question, he said he had heard with satisfaction the announcement that negotiations had commenced for terminating the Persian quarrel, fearing that the expedition to Bushire meant more than it appeared to mean, and mighlt lvad to xerious consequences. o
v as of opinion that it was the oonstitationa dutyof the Government, when the expedition was determined upon, to call- Parliament together. With regard to italy, he confessed that he was not satisfied with what had taken place. If the King of NAPLEs had; been informed that eoYtain termis had been agreed upon between YFrance and Great Britain, and hadbeen required to assent to them on' pain of compulsion, he believed the KING -ould at once have asented. The course actually pursued had been abortive, ancd had made things -wdrse than before. He described the deplorable condition of the Papal States under foreign occupation, and asked why this state of things shouild continue for years without remonstrance. He had no doubt, he said, if a day weYe fixed *hen the oceupation of the Roman Legations by Austrian troops should cease, there would be some chance of an independent State, while a danger to Europe would be removed. 1e concluded with some retlections mpon the siibject of the finances.
Mr. M. Gansox diesented from that part of the Address which approved oflthe Persian war, and reiterated Mr. GIL&DSTONx'S question, which had not, he said, been answered, " Who was to pay for this war?" He condemned the course adopted towards the King of NAPLES, and suggested that it would be wiser for this country to desist from dictating to foreign nations what governnent-they should have. He had great difliculty, he said, in the absence of information, in agreeing to that-paru of the Address which related to China. He commented upon certain portions of the Royal Speech,
and upon its omissions, contending that, after the' war, broader views relating- to our domestic policy should have been announced in the Speech.
After some observations by~ Mr. EIADEruD and Mr. V. SMITH regarding the cultivation of cotton in India, the motion was agreed to.
The House adjourned at half-past 12 o'clock.

We have acquiesced with much content in the
We have acquiesced with much content in the wish lately expressed in high quarters, that no anticipation of the Royal Address should be permitted to appear in the public journals. For the same reason we do not take it amiss that the Royal Address itself is no longer so prospective and explicit a document as it used to be. In the present instance it is almost strictly confined to the exercise of the Royal prerogative. EHu
MAJESTY simply tells her Parliament what she has done in the recess. With her allies she has obtained from Russia a complete execution of the Treaty of Paris; with the Emperor of the FzENcH she has successfully mediated between Prussia and. Switzerland, but has been obliged to suspend diplomatic relations with Naples. Our difficulties in Central America have been settled, so far as they can be without the ratification of the UJnited States' Senate; but Persia has forced us into war by the siege and capture of Herat, and we have been obliged to take strong measures with China. HEx MAjxsTy has concluded a treaty with Siam. Thus far concerns our foreign policy, with which Parliament only claims an indirect and retrospective interference. When we come to the rest of the Address, where custom has led us to expect a list of specific announcements, we find, besides some generalities, or rather formalities, common to all Royal Speeches, the bare notice of two subjects-one of them simply the necessary renewal of a lapsed charter, and,the other the dead lock of the law relating to Joint-stock Banks. It would have been impossible to give us less information in the same number of words. Unless the Address be simply a reference to Parliament to think for itself, the Parosgru has acted on one of his political maxims, not to betray your udtimatum. at the commencement of your negotiations. No doubt, it is advisable to be chary of promises, when it has happened so recently that of all the seven measures announced by HpB MAEsTY from the throne not one was so fortunate as to pass into law before the end of the session. The result of this caution, however, is that the Royal Speech has only been used on this occasion to conceal the Mnisterial intentions; and HIER IAJASTY, whom some writers love to decribe as a constitutional fiction, has been used for a political screen.
With all the skill shown in the construction of the Speech, both in what it says and in what it does not say, it has been found equally open to attack. Lord DRBBY and Lord GnEY in the Upper House, and Mr. DisRAIx I and Mr. GLADsToxFn in the Lower, have found a good deal to say about it. A treaty so framed as to require a second negotiation to complete it; an interference in one quarter which ended in a suspension of diplomatic intercourse, and in another where the result is not yet known; two new wars in the East -one of them secretly determined on before the close of last session, and both of them as mysterious in their origin as they are hazardous in their results,-these topics supply what may be called the positive material for political criticism. But the negative character of the Speechthe gravity of its silence and the wilfulness of its omission-has provoked more censure than even bad diplomacy and wars. " What about the " Income-tax VI resounds in both Houses, and even in the Upper Lord BtouonMf, like a veteran proud of his youthful achieven-ents, tells how he fought and conquered the Income-tax in 1816. An extensive combination of Parliamentary sections awaits the CHANczoro of the ExcHEmuxn, who very reasonably asks the House to suspend its jadgment till the estimates are before it. These he undertakes to bring forward at an early day. No doubt, we must know what we have to pay for; and, though economy may effect wonders in the long run, there is not lkely to be so much elasticity in the estimates of one year as to leave a margin for the adoption or rejection of a tax yielding more than seven millions. That is the immediate question at issue. Are we to pay the additional 9d. in the pound this next year or not? We are among those who would patiently wait to hear the CHAnCELLOR of the ExcfEQuEE on the subject. With Mr. GLnDSTONE, we would rather not have another loan, and have an almost equal objection to more taxes. The third course open is the estimates. Unfortunately, we find them already in the process of reduction. They have been reduced, we are assured, as low as prudence will permit. "But," says Ir. GrDsronx, "we
are an extravagant people; when we have money, or can get it, we will spend." The son of a rich parent will draw on his liberality or his weakness, and the British people will always give way to impulses when they feel that their resources are practically inexhaustible. Thus it is, says Mr. GLADSTONE, we will go to war with everybody; and he proposes to keep both the estimates and consequently, also, the taxation low, in order to chasten this unruly, exuberant spirit. It is unfortunate that the tax on which we have presumed so much is that on which the glory of Sir ROBERT PEarL is principally founded.
Various announcements in the course of the evening partially made up for the studied reserve of the Royal Speech. The subject of secondary punishments, and particularly transportation, the law of divorce, testamentary jurisdiction, and ecclesiastical law, are to have early attention. Several independent members announced their intended contributions to the stock of debate. The truth is, the legislation of the country is undergoing a change in some respects for the better. It is becoming more continuous and more uniform. Measues are ceasing to be the strokes and stratagems of party. They are not strongholds or operations of a strategic character. A Minister rests now rather on his general capacity and credit than on a budget of schemes eiaborated in a long period*of opPosition or suddenly drawn fromsome
hidden political tr6a*W. Our vast maas of Parliamentary literature, our frequent combination of opposite politicians on the same commnittees, the repeated adoption of measures by one Government from the poliEcy- of another,' and our act-dal coalitions, have almost put it out of the power of 'any one party to gain much advantage over another by the mere force of. measures. The very difficulties and delays of Parliamentary business have contributed to the same result. Bills only drop in one session to re-I appear in the next. Eence a session is no longer a dramatic unity. Action is suspended and resumed, and the Royal salatation of the new. Fession adds nothing to the valediction of the last. If this important and now recognized change eases the responsibility of Governments, it adds to that of independent members. NTo circumstances, no time, can now be pleaded against the introduction *of measures which do not run their lives against the session, but which, if worth anything, may berenewed session after session till they are finally vworked into law.- We trust that the numerous class which disclaims party, and professes to think for itself, will take the hint, and do for its country what it is no longer necessary to do for the security of a Cabinet or the influence of an Opposition.

If expressions of intention and notices of motion
If exprensions of intention and notices of motion may be accepted as proofs of zeal, we are entitled to hope that the important question of our convict system wil shortly occupy the attention of our Iegislators. Mr. H&vrnx last night gave notice that on Monday nex' the SECRETAnY of STATr for the Honz DEPART=NT would ask leave to bring in a bill to amend the act of the 16th and l7th of VICTORIA, chap. 93, entitled " An act to substitute "in certain cases other punish,nents in leu of "transportation." The same highfunctionary intends, moreover, on the same day, to ask leave to introduce a measure to faciEitate the establishment of reformatory schools throughout England. In addition to these notices on the part of the Government, we find that Lord BERNuES is about to move for a return of the number of tickets of leave issued each year since the commencement of the system, in order to obtain material for bringing the sabject formaly under the consideration of the House. We shall look with the greatest anxiety to the explanations of the Ho SECRE TARY, and for the declaration of i views. Nothing less than a comprehensive meastis to be expected from so high an officer of State after such long delay. During the recess Sir GEORGE GREY and the Qum's advisers have had the opportunity of examining the subject thoroughly, and of making up their minds as to the best method of dealing with this great national grievance. This is no party question--it is one of vast social importance, with which Whigs and Tories-if such men there be-Conservatives and Liberals-Ins and Outs are equally concerned. A Derbyite, a Peelite, a Manchester Peacemonger, have equal objections to the gripe of the garotter. The man who wil offer a good suggestion upon such a point is a far more useful member than the orator who delivers the most thrilling speech. As the question is so soon to be formally brought under the attention of the House, we may, perhaps, be permitted to say a word or two which may have a tendency to give some little precision of thought to the impending discussion. What we most fear is that the one vital point-the one point for which, to the exclusion of aU others, we are contending, may be lost sight of amid a host of arguments upon the general theory of punishment, and amid conflicting statements as to the greater or smaller number of ticket-of-leave men who may have been reclaimed. These discussions may be all very well at other times, but just now the necessity of action is too obvious, the danger to society too imminent, for pause or hesitation. The criminal population of these islands-that is to say, the veterans and pedagogues of crime--must be sent out into the wilderness. They or we must go; we cannot together inhabit the land.
What we want, then, is this :-We require some practical measure for transporting from the shores of England altogether such persons as may be judged incapable of reformation. This incapacity may be inferred from the heinous nature of their offencesfrom their long persistence in criminal coursesand by many other tests which a practised criminal Judge will readily apply. A sentence of transportation must be carefully weighed before it is delivered, when it carries with it such consequences as banishment in perpetuity. We have no doubt, however, of the value and wholesomeness of the principle, both as far as society is concerned and in the interest of the convicts them,selves. Here they have little or no chance of reformation. Every gust of wind that passes over their heads whispers in the ears of all men the story of their shame. The mark of CAiN is said to be on the murderer's brow, that all men who see it may know him and shun his abhorred presence. But has not the burglar, too, his defiant slouch-the pickpocket the sidelong, uneasy glance ? Who can mistake the gaol-bird who has not, the force of circumstances aiding him, been enabled to enter upon and steadily to pursue L course of honest industry ? Well, then, what we want is to see the primary discussion narrowed to the consideration of one great principle-can our worst convicts be retained at home with safety to society ? We say, " No !" The amount of property exposed throughout these islands to the violence of the burglar and the dexterous legerdemain of the thief is so considerable that it cannot be guarded at all points without the intervention of an overwhelming police force, which would be a national calamity. Our outlying countryhouses are not protected. We walk about the byatreets of our cities and the cross-roads adjacent to our country towns at all hours of the night. Order must be maintained at aU events. This result cannot be arrived at in any other way than by absolutely crushing the headquarters of the gangs wherever they may be found, and by summarily removing the most dexterous rogues out of the country altogether. Let there be no maudlin sympathy for this class of persons. They take to crime as a profession or trade as a man makes himself an attorney or sets up as a plumber and glazier. The police know them, and could, if required, soon lay their hands upon 90 per cent. of the professional vagabonds of the country. It is of these, and these only, that we are speaking. Let them be gone from among us to some other portion of the earth's surface, on which they may earn a living and rise even to competence and wealth if they will but persist in the habits of industry which they had acquired in prison. Of course we are not spealing of the wretched shopboy who filches his first pound from his master's till; of the still more miserable girl who, in a fit of despair, extinguishes that faint flicker of life which had just been lighted at her own; nor of any casual and fortuitous crime or offence of any kind. To all persons who may have thus transgressed in GoD's name let us extend that mercy and forbearance of which the best among us stand so deeply in need.
We trust, then, that in the ensuing discussions in Pariament this principle may be kept distinct from all others. We know right well the value of reformatories, and how powerfuil a agaent they may be made under proper guidance for the salvation of 7outhful offenders, We do not care to
enter upon any tieket-ofleave ducussion. is
have often said before, it mattera but little to any of us whether the convictl who is cast prematurely back upon the country is or is not armed with a ticket of leave. We do not desire to see compinEons instititeil between this sort of prison ania that sort of prison. We want to see'those persons whose presence is dangerous to society ia this country extruded from the limits of the country, Iand compelled to pUs their days elkewherenot necessarl,y in bondage, nor in misery-but; at any rate at a distance from the British shores. If a burglar should get into a man's house, and is engaged in rummaging the, plate-chest, the owner of the property does not ordinarily rush to his library to refresh himself with a chapter of Bccria--nor does he commence the firat sections. of an essay upon the reformation of little criminal boys. He takes-if he be a man of heart-a poker in his hand, and goe-4 straight at BiLT Snyrs. The commonest exercise of reason tells him that BiLL SYRES cannot be left groping in the drawing-room for an indefinite 'priod, with full liberty to prize open all the cupboards and appropriate wvhat property he chooses, to mnake no mention of the perils to life which his presence entails. Now, the presence of a regular criminal population in England is to the country what the nocturnal foray of that one burglar is to the individual householder. They and he must be got rid of out of the country and out of the house.

Whatever complexion may be attributed in the
Whatever complexion may be attributed in the heat of political strife to the origin or circumstances of our rupture wit'n China, we are persuaded that the matter will wear but one aspect when considered by the light of common sense and fair reason. AII wars are deplorable, but they are not always to be avoided, and every fresh mail from the East confirms the belief that the affair of the Arrow was but the expression on the part of the Chinese of an animosity long entertained, and sure to explode, sooner or later, in active hostility. With regard to that character of the vessel which gave us the title to interfere, it ought surely to be sufficient to observe that the presumption of our obligations in this respect was unhesitatingly accepted and acted upon by every one of the parties concerned,-by t-be master of the Arrow, who reported to our authorities the attack upon his vessel, by our Consul,, who investigated the circumstances on the spot immediately after their occturence, and finally by YEH himself, who at last restored the captured seamen, though not after the fashion required. On the latter point, too, if further evidence were needed of the spirit in which the Chinese Governor enters upon such questions, we have only to turn to the recorded particulars of his quarrel with the Americans. The Imperial troops had fired upon the United States' colours, which were not only conspicuously flying, but were actually waved from the boat to prevent the possibility of mistake. Here, then, there could be no kind of doubt, and yet what were the proceedings of Governor Ysrm when the facts were formally brought to his knowledge? He served Commuissioner PAnKER exactly as he served ConsulPEAs,andrefusedthesatisfaction demanded until his forts had been knocked to pieces by way of enforcing the requisition. From his own despatch, too, we observe the shalowness of the pretext on which his refusal had been based. " Henceforth," said he, " let the fashion of the flag which " American ships employ be clearly defined, and " inform me what it is beforehand,"-as if an
ifficial in his position could possibly have been unacquainted with the stars and stripes of the United States.
The points of the question invested with the greatest importance at the present moment are those which concern our actual position and the probable policy of the Chinese. In a military sense there appears no reason for anxiety even if the reinforcements applied for by Sir J. Bowxme should not be readily forthcoming. Indeed, it is not a little remarkable to observe the f utility of the Chinese armaments, notwithstanding the apparent efficiency of their material and the species of energy displayed by their troops. We no longer meet with mimic guns or pasteboard fortifications. "The forts," says Sir MCHAEXL SEYoUR in his last despatch, speaking of thoge destroyed by the Americans on the 6th of December, " were of
enormous strength and solidity, being entirely "built of large blocks of granite, with walls
9 or 10 feet thick. They were heavily armed, "many of the guns being 7 or 8 tons weight, "with a bore of 13 inches; one brass 8k-inch "gun was over 21 feet long." This description might serve for the batteries of Cronstadt or Sebastopol; nor does it appear that the Chinese are deficient in resolution or inspired with any peculiar dread of European arms. They re-armed the Blenheim Fort, they reoccupied and strengthened the French Folly, and twice rallied at the latter point, when our troops landed to dislodge them. Even when they had been fairly driven off and our artillerymen were demolisliing the fort, it was necessary to cover them during the operations lest they should be disturbed by renewed advances of the enemy. What is especially singular, and indeed almost unintelligible, both in the reports from Canton and those from Bushire, is the credit given on all sides to the artillery practice of the Persians and the Chinese, combined with the actual harmlessness of their efforts in this direction. We are assutred that our enemies keep up a well-sustained fire; we find that they have heavy cannon well mounted, and yet our vessels and troops escape with comparatively little damage. The Encounter received a 68-pound shot in her hull, and the single casualty which occurred in the attack on the French Folly Fort was caused by what is termed a " rocket arrow," so that the Chinese have formidable weapons enough at their command. Sir MCIxcEIL SEY-OUR, however, observes with confidence that, even if the whole force collected by Yzu within the city were to attack the factories, he should " have no fear of the result."
In estimating the policy of the Chinese Government, we find the question complcated by an unusual variety of contingencies. The supreme authorities at Pekin may or may not be correctly informed of the state of affairs at Canton, and, besides the embarrassment thus rendered possible, it must be recollected that the chief provinces of the country are in the hands of an independent authority-that of the rebel Government. It is evident, indeed, already that affairs are taking their aspect not merely from the actual circumstances of the rupture, but from the chronic influences of the insurrection. It is conjectured that our proceedings will be represented at Pekin as an adoption of the cause of the rebels; and, although such an allegation would be utterly unfounded, it is impossible but that the occupation with which we are now providing the lmperialists allould greatly improve the opportunities of the insurgents. They have accordingly made head again in the province of Canton, in which they had been overawed by the horrible severities of YES himself; and, as his troops are now concentrated for the defenoee of thecity, they have been enabled to xeize a considerable town within 40 miles of the capital -a proceeding which might be eily described as due to our co-operation.
The most desirable result, under all the circumstances, would be that the rupture should be confined in its effects.to the scene of its origin, ana
terminated at last 'b the conce3sions to which, in such a contest, even Chinese obstinacy must be ultimately driven. There is nothing, in fast, in our dem-nds beyond wliat actual treaties, as wel
as common pruderie* entitle us to require. We are quite 'as villing as tho Chinese themiselves to suppress piracy and to ooncert anry uch measures as may be most efficReious for that purpose. We dem=tn only that our flag shall be respected-& condition which, in terms at least, will probably provoke no denial, and that for the future we shall be admitted to such facilities of intercourse as will remove the stigma of inferiority tnder whMch our exclusion places us in the eyes of the natives, and serve to obviate all such misunderstandings as naturally ariso from circaitous or defective communications between authorities. This may be mortifying to the pride and insolence of the popuIlace of Canton, but it is certainly no more than a poweraul State has a right to exact at the hands of a nation enriching itself by the trade of those very foreigner3- whom it affects to contemn. At this moment the revenue accnuing to the Imperial Government from the two ports of Shanghai and Foochow alone is camputed at $5,000,000, though even thejustification thus attaching to our demands does not constitute their chief warrant. Our claims are foundel at bottom on the. absolate necessity of imposing some control on Chinese presumption for the sake, of our own security. . We might very well afford. to regard such pretensions -with ridicule, but the truth is, that they serve as the symbol and expression of more dangerous opinions. As long as the swarming and truculent population of Canton find themselves confirmed in the position of exclusiveness which, in defiance of treaty, they have obstinately maintained, so long will they believe that they are superior to us, politically as well as personally. We must assert our rights, not for pride's sake, but for self-preservation; and we can then subside into the only character we desire to support in those parts-that of energetic and successful traders.

REPORTIKO G 1:2 THE HIOUsr OF LonDs.-Some time ago the Lord Chamberlain was good enough to apprpriate a room to the use of the reporters in the House of Lords. The kindness of his Lordship was duly appreciated by those whom it was intended to benefit, for the apartment was commodious and convenient. This room was prepared for the reception of the reporters as usual yeaterday morning, but about midday the tables and writing-desks were removed from it to another apartment, which is too small to aupply the requisite accommodation. The officers of the House themselves seem not to be aware who was the author of this ansumary and discoturteous proceeding; but, as it is in direct violation of the formally expressed intentions of the Lord Chamberlain, it iray not unreasonably be expected that this notice wililead to the immediate restitution of the reporters' room.

PARIS, MOsNAY, Fms. 2, 6 p.w
The manufacturers of Paris received a fewv orders for exportation last week. This is the seasois wvhen foreign conmnitsion agents generally commence their purchases, but as yet they appear extremely cautious, and complain- that the prices asked are higher than their commisions enable them to give. The refusal of the manufacturers to give long credits has likewise thrown a gloom over the market. Articles of Paris manufacture are in somewhat better demand for the South American markets. The cabinetmakers in the Faubourg St. Honor6 have likewise received or4ers for Italy and Spain. The stuff manufacturers are doing nQthing, nor is it expected that their dead season will finish before the end of the month. The retail trade of Paris is equaUy languiishing. It is feared that the price of silk goods will rate high during the entire year. The price of raw silk,which showed a disposition to decline last month, has again risen in the southern markets, notwithstandina the immense supplies received from Italy and GRna. A general. rse has taken place in the *markets for colonial produce throughout Frauce.
It appears that the stock of ooffee and sugar on hand is smaller tban usual, and letters from abroad mention that those articles are scarce. Letters from St. Petersburg inform us that active negotiations are pending for the reduction of the exi3ting duties, and that the Russian Government is inclined to make an abatement in favour of certain articles of French produce and manufacture. The Emperor Alexander is said to be at length convinced that a modification of his customs tariff is the only mode of putting an end to the extensive. smuggling trade which is going forward on his frontiers, andwhich causes such serious loss to the Russian revenue. The price of corn is stationary. The continual rains during the end of December and the first fortnight of January have produced a certain influence on the corn market, and have stopped the progress of the fall in prices. The lAt accounts, however, from the provinces state that the growing crops have not suffered, and that there is as yetnocauseforapprehensionforthe ensuing harvest. The stock of wheat, and rye in the hands of the farmers is still abundant, and large supplies of wheat are expected from Southern Russia during the spring. The bakers have bonght but little flour this week. The beat marks have been sold at 78f. and inferior at 74f. the sack of 157 kilogrammes. The stock of flour in the reserve stores has declined to 7,000 metrical quintals, but there is a sufficient supply in the entrepot. The millers have stopped working, in hopes of raising the price of flour to a fair proportion with that of wheat. The Paris cornmarket was firm last week, particularly for wheat. Several buyers from Lyons attended, but they looked only for the best article. Picardy offered the greatest quantity of wheat, and sellers endeavoured to obtain an increase of 70c. the hectolitre, but they were forced to accept the price of the Precedinrig market, 27f. the hectolitre. The price of nuther's meat continues as high as ever, and many housekeepers now attend the sales by auction in hopes of obtaining their provisions on better terms. The wine-market at Bercy is completely paralyzed by the exceasive prices demanded. At a late sale by auction at Bordeaux Laffitte was sold at 1,300f. the barreL Wine of Cahors is sold at from 800f. to 1,000f. the barreL Ordinary wine in the hands of the peasants is sold at from 510f. to 550f. the barreL Brandies are much sought for and maintain their price. Old Armagnac is exceedingly searce. Beetroot spirits of wine is quoted in Paris at 125f. the hectolitre.

BERLIN, Fm. 1L
The latest news we have from Copenhagen verifies my statement published in your last Friday's impression, to the effect that the final conferences for the settlement of the Sound Dues question have not yet been opened in the Danish capital. The Danish Government is endeavouring by separate negotiation with each of the various Governments that have as yet signified their acquiescence in the Danish plan to come to an arrangement as to the rate of interest that each shall pay on the outstanding balance of its redemption-money after having paid up one or more instalments. It is evident that the Danish Government does not think of putting off the final settlement of the matter until all the 23 States with which it has treaties for the regulation of the Sound Dues have come to conclusive termas; it will suffice for Denmark's purpose to have obtained the coneurrence of the most prominent, and the rest will be morally compelled to follow in their wake. According to the estimate formed in competent circles in Copenhagen, the separate negotiations that are at present going on will be so far ripe by next April as to admit of the final conferences being held in that month; so that sanguine expectations may fairly be enterrained of the Sound Dues being abolished in time for the opening of the Baltic navigation next spring.

(FROM OUR OWN ConRRESoPNDEN.)
TURIN, JAx. 30.
His Majesty King Victor Emmanuel returned here this morning from Nice. He arrived by special train from Genoa about 1 a.m., and, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour, a considerable crowd was assembled at the railway station, by whom he was greeted writh the usual demonstrations of loyal affection. While at Nice His Majesty received the following address from the English residents there:-
" Sire,-At a moment when the inhabitants of this city are solicitous of pronvi to your Majesty their affection and their fidelity on the occasion of your first visit to this country,we, English subjects established or temporarily resident in this city, are happy to profit by this circumstance to have the honour of being MA"."tted to your august presence, in order to offer our congratulations and our bomage to your Majesty, to attest the cordiality of our respectful sentiments, and to express to your Majesty our gratitude for the civil and religious privileges enjoyed by a great nauber of our fellow-countrymen every year in this happy country by tbe grace of your benevolent government.
"We presume to remmindyou of the alliance which exists between your Majesty and our gracious Sovereign, and to express a lively hope that the friendship and mutual sympaties which now exist between the subjects of your Majesty and the English people may be of long duration.
"I We earnestly pray Divine Providence to continue to grant prosperity to the States of your Majesty, under the auspices ot your illustrioas family, and to your Majesty a long and glorious reign."s
The deputation to which this address was confded for presentation was received by the King with the greatest affability, and he replied to it by a few words of thanks, and spoke of the friendship existing between England and Sardinia, and the cordial reception which he himself met with when he went to England. As His Majesty returned by the coast road from Nice to Genoa, the inhabitants profited by this first occasion offered them of testifying their attachment to the person of their Sovereign and his Government, and nowhere
was His Majesty received wvith greater enthusiasm than at Mlentone, the capital of the principality of lMonaco, when the whole town was lluminated from
one end to the other, and he was met by the authorities at the head of the National Guard, and by them escorted through the town. Although it was between 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning when His Majesty arrived at 3Mentone the people were al in the streets and saluted him with vociferous aeclama-
tions. His Majesty was accompanied on his rettun from Nice by Count Cavour, his Prime Minister. On arriving at the railway station here he was met b,y Prince Cearignano and the Ministers of War and
'the Interior, and I understaad he.iexprsqed him'
-sel*-as extremely gratified with the manner in which' he had everywhere been received.
The journey of the.Emperor of Anstriatotheo,ther States of 1 ly Of cOurseattracts Iuch.att0ition, andexcites speculationasto its object. It appears certain, iLdeed, that the Austrian (4overnmnetstill enfermns a hope of inducing Modena and Parma to^ renew the Customs League; and itis said Baron/ Bruck will make a visit to those duchies wiith theview of impregsing on the Ducal Governments the advantages he proposes for them. The Imperial progres, however, is supposed to have a1far higher aim than a mere Customs League, and that it is undertaken in pursuance of the long-cherishea Austriau scheme of forming an AkustroItaliau - Confederation.
L'fndepcndente, a new journal of Turin, which really merits its name, and which, since its appearance, has been diinguished for its impartiality and he good sense of its 'remarks, publishes the following observations to-day on this subject:
*The object of the journey of the Emperor (of Austria) to Tuscany, and perhaps also to Naples, is fo draw cloeer than ever the bonds of friendship between those two Courts and that of Vienna.; Since 1848, and especially since the Treaty of Paris, Ausria has soughttorunite about her the Italan Princes, in order to opos them to Piedtnont. The Cabinet of Vienna seeks by all in its power to remodel by this means the work of the Cons of Paris, Isolating A great partof Italy, and draFing[tto. wards Germany. That Cabinet well knows'that the Sardi. nian system is to join Italy with England and with France, in order to draw it from the state of oblivlbn in which it has lain 'and to place it within the circle of European political action without detrimeht to its national personality. Those who judge superficially of the political aims of Piedmont and the facts which occurred at the Congress of Paris think that the Sardinian Cabinet would submit the Peninsula to foreign influences. Very different is the sentiment of those who see through the husk of apparent facts. Piedmont applies herself with all her force to find frierids for Italy, because she is profoundly persuaded that Isolation would be most unfortunate. Unable by means of the Italian Princes to o pose a barrier to Austrian prponderance, she is obligea, s has been alreadv exnpaine.aa the Paris Congress, to call the attention of her friends to the danger for the peaceof Europe if the political' equihbrium in Italy should be broken by the predominance of Austria. The object of the system followed by Piedmont is not to feadalize Itely, as some say, to France or' England, but to restrain Austria so that the princes of the Peninsula may act freely in their own States. If she has not yet succeeded in this object that is no reason why she should not do so, persevering with pertinacity and taking advantage of all ocaions that may aprar favourable. Piedmont places herself between Fahace, England, and Austria as an intermediate body to prevent all those Powers from lording it over Italy, as it were or from binding it to their political car. Austria seeingthis clearly, and would, by putting herself at the head of a political confederation with Tuscany, Rome, and Naples, make herselfthe representative of Italyin the faceof Europ We believethat suchare theactual efforts of the Vienna Cabinet, and such (in part)the significance of thejourneyof tha Ea peror toltaly. We have a firm hope, however that our Ca-
met may acquire over the Italian Courts the authority necessary to prevent this object; nevertheess vwe think it ought with industry, with prudence, and with the aid of the alhed Powers, to oppose itsdf earnestly to the system of an Austro-Italian Conederation. France and England have therein a common interest with us. An Austro-Italan Confederation would give Germany an Immense preponde. rance on the continent of Earope. Piedmont, since the Congress of Paris, cannot in any way be considered by the alled Powers as a special State, restricted within itself, but as the guardian and representative of the Peninsula. Every fresh step taken im thi8 matter by Ausa is against the system of the allied Ltowers; tefoea confederation of any kind which should tend to set aside Piedmont, and subject the other Italian provinces to the political systern of Asra,d woglad bse asucoftegreatest evil for France

Destruction Of A Church By Fire.-On Sun-
DpsmuorrON OF A CHURCH BY fltnE.-On SUnday morning a fire broke out in the ancient parish church of Wallsaey, so well known to all who make occasional excursions on the Cheshire side of the Mersey. The flames spread rapidly, the persons present being unablo to do anything towvards arresting their progress. Erom every window the fire burst fortb. In a very short time the roof of the body of the edifice fell in, and then it became evident that the building must very soon be utterly destroyed. The whole of tho body of the church was completely gutted, and presented nothing buta heap of smoulderng ruins. The tower remains standing. The register-books and *omo documents of value connected with the church, which vwere kept in a large iron safe in the vestry,were the only things saved from the conflagration. The communion plate, the altarcloth, and the large valuable service books of the church were weekly removed to the rectory, and thus fortunately escaped destruction. Amon; the property destroyed was an iron chest, containing a large number of deeds relating to awards of lands in the parish, but we understand that there are duplicates of these documents lodged at Chester. The handsome organ, which was erected a few years ago, and which cost 300 guineas, was totally consmned; also a handsome font, presented to the church by Mr. Chambers. The church contained a sEt of six bells, which fell with a tremendous crash during the progress of the fire. Only two of the bells remain entire, the remainder being broken to pieces.: iIt is supposed that some of the flues for heating the building, becoming overheated, had ignited the flooring, and thas led to the results which followed. The losg is covered by insuranbe'to the extent of about 2,0001., but this, it is considered, will faU far short of-the actual damage which has resulted from the conflsgration. The church was one of the oldest ecclesiastical edifices in the neighbourhood. The tower beirs the date of 1530, although the church itself waw rebuilt abont 100 years ago. -

- - Tuesday Evening.
The quotation of gold at Paris is about 6 per mille premnium,andthe short exchange on London is 25.17-
egr11. sterling. . On compaing these rates with the
nglish Mintprice'of 31. 17ks 10 d. per ounce'for standard gold, it appears thAt gold is nearly 7-lOths per cent. dearer in Paris than im London.
By advices from Hamburg the price of gold is 422 per mark, and the short exchange on london is 13.3 per 11. sterling. Standard gold at the English Mint price is therefore about 2-10ths per cent. dearer in Hamburg than in London.
'The courae pf exchange at New york on London for bills at 60-days' sight is 108g per cent., which, when compared with the Mint par between the two countries, shows that the exchange is against England. But, after making allowance for charges of transport and difference of itterest, the present rate leaves no profit on the transmission of gold either way between the twvo countries.
The English funds opened to-day at the closing prices of last evening, but the market ultimately e.xhibited iacreased firmne5s. Consols for money were first quoted 93 to I- and, with the exception of a short period during whaich there were sellers at 93, they remained without alteration until the arrival of the Queen's Speech, when an advance of nearly a quarter per cent. took place, which was maintained to the termination of business. The final tranactions were at 93k to i for money, and 93E to f for the 6th of March. As the Queen's Speech contains no statements that appear calculated to influence the funds beyond the announcement that the Estimates have been prepared with economy, it must be inferred that the improvement that took place immediately after its publication was consequent upon operations having then been entered into by purchasers who had walted to see if it would contain anything of an unfavourable character. Some persons were disposed to attribute the rise to the paragraph recommending the Bank Charter Act and the currency laws to consideration, upon the extraordinary assumption that an expansion of the note circulation may possibly be contemplated; but it seemsout of thequestionthat thisideacould, even for a moment, have exercised the slightest influence. Bank Stock left off at 216 to 218; Reduced, 934 to. ; New Three per Cents., 93g. to ; India
;tock, 218 to 220; Exchequer-bonds, 934 to 4, and India-bonds and Exchequer-bills, Is. discount to 2s. premium.
In the Stock Exchange io-day money was again in fair supply for loans on Government securities at 6 per cent. Out of doors, notwithstanding the preparations for the 4th of the month, the demand was not excessive, and at the Bank also the applications were slightly les numerous.
Poreign securities were fairly supported, but the operations oiinue limited. In Turkish Six per Cents. transs&ions took place at 934 for money and 931 and i for the account. Venezuela was negotiated at 374 for the awount. The other business comprised -Brazilian Five per Cents., 102i; Mexican, 210 ; Peruvian for account, 78 and 79; Portuguese Three per Cents., for account5 444; Russian Five per Cents., 1084 and 108; the Four-and-a-Ralf per Cents., 96Ol and 96 - Spanish Certificates, 64 and i; Dutch Two-and-a-half per Cents., 64 and 65; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 98 and 984.
In the foreign exchanges this afternoon there was an improvement in the rates for Austrian paper. With regard to other places there was no particular lteration.
The closing quotations of the French Three per Cents, on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. 80c. for money, and 68f. 10c. for the new account at the end of the month. The improvement of three-eighths per cent., which occurred yesterday, has, therefore, been entirely lost.
A further sum of about 20,0001. in gold was taken from the Bank to-day for exportation.
The gold brought by the Asia to-day from New York is 87,0001., but the whole is stated to be on French account. The commercial advices on this occasion are favourable, most descriptions of securities having experienced an advance of one or two per cent. Erie Railway stock was quoted 624 to 63; Reading, 83i to 84; Panama, 93; New York Central, 94, and Illinois Central, 127A. The firmness of the market was attributable to an increase of 170,0001. during the week in the stock of specie held by the banks. In business generaly there was nothing new, transactions of all kinds having been interrupted by unusually severe weather and a fall of snow, which had blocked up the principal railways and detained nearly all the mails. Occasional failures continued to be announced among the small banks in the interior. The Governor of Michigan haddelivered his annual message, but it contained not the slightest allusion to the infamy in which that State lies from the long-standing repudiation of the principal part of its debt. With regard to the Californian repudiationthere is nothingfresh. One firm writes:-' We do not place muce confidence in the principles of the people, and hardly think, if a vote were taken this winter, they would assune the debt. By the next election, however, they will have had time to reflect." In New York the suspension had been announced of Messrs. Kelly, Townshend, and Co., but their liabilities were not large. A statement had appeared in one of the papers professing to give the number of failures in the UitedStates during the past year, so far as they could be ascertained. The total is 2,705 with estimated average liabilities of 4,0001. each, representing an aggregate of nearly 11,000,0001. They were princip-aly among smaU dealers in imported goods, and the assets on the average are supposed to have yielded about 25 per cellt. More than a fourth of these failures occurred at New York.
Tne precise amount of specie shipped by the Ripon is 971,3001., of which 783,2001. is silver for Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta, and 159,0001. for Hongkong, Canton, and ShanghaL About 10,7001. is sent to enang and Singapore. The total of gold does not exceed 18,4001.
Intelligence was received this afternoon that the Brazil mail steamer Tamar, having completed her repairs, left Vigo on the 30th uit.
The Strand and Holborn branches of the Royal British Bank were sold to-day; the former for 6,1001., and the lease of the latter for 2101.

The demand for most kinds of yarn has been quiet,.anl in some kinds rather lower prices havo beea submitted to. Most kinds of twist suitable for Germany and the fedister
ranean may be quoted id. per lb. easier, and cops foi tbe home trade are also mostly id. per lb. cheaper. In both these depkrtnients only a very moderate budness8 has been effected at the decline. or yarnB suited, to jndiaS the demand has boen very inconsiderable. There is still some busine4s doing for Russia, and the de. xnaud is likely, it is tbought; to continue for some time. In 30Vs water and upwards, and in. 40's mule and higher eount4, for that market, prices are consequently study In cotton cloth there is a moderate busineas for moat descriptions, except the goods suitable for India and China, at. steady rates: but the last-Damed goods are eader to buy, and moet sellers have placed their quotions rather lower to-day. The decline, however, has failed to attract much attention from buyers, who are acting with much caution.
Messrs. John Shlgg and Co. report of the cloth-mar.
*- There is rcay no ehange to note in the poeetiou ot the m&ket;e since Taesay last. With the exceptlon of 40-inch shirtinag forlis.

The wvoolen cloth-maLrkets this morning have been rather less active than on Saturday. The tone of the market, how.- ever, is firm, and tle6 in fair proportion to the quantity of cloth brought forward have taken place. Wool keeps up in price.
The Huddersfield woollen-market to-day was quite y4p tothe average of the past fewv weeks, but the sales were mostly In cheap fancies, cotton warps, and low -priced goods forspring orders. There is little wfool in the market, and it in chiefly iu second bands.
NOTTINGHAM, TuEsDAY. y
The lace trade still remains quiet, but there are expectations of a change very soon, and manufacturers anticipat, a busy season. Stocks being very low, a brisk demand wilL cause great actiVity. The price of silk lass still an upivarc& tendency, and yarns are selling at extremely high price3. There is very little doing in fancy laces.
The hoeiery trade is active, and a betterprice is being obainedforgoods. There is an abundance of employment and manufacturers are preparing for the spring demand:
