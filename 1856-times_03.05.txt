We accept the reotificati,n off tIe limits Xmpost i for Besarabia, and for the-Asiitio-province&si Wc idhere to the condition about not re-estabiising the fortresg of Bomarsund; and we desire- that the El'es of Alsad sihal be a menace for no one-. There- is me'o. no dilty as to Wicholaiee, and we givw-up; wibhovticompensatle, the city of Ears to our ancient andigood ally the Sulita2Tr v The Emanc#Ption gses on; t& MY that this lan. guage caused (as Well it. m3ight) .a profound sensation-so profound; that thli e nipentiaries remained silent, no doubt with Joy. One of them found his utterance- suffieaently X sy "Asweare all agreed letna ani " The Thesigww r were at once affixed, and the Plenipoteatiaries shook hands and parted. Thc aincf- o- ul;&ily adds, that on the following, diy (Monday) the ,liperor's speech would contain the annou mtcenet that; peace was made. The Iade*eus4awe does not enter so miuch into detail, but it ma:itains its aseetio,1 of the prelminaries being sig and alseo states that the Emperor's speech would contain the announcement abDupeae. I neehrly saythat:thsistory is oegwdedhlero as similar t that of the frst-takng of SebastQPn, and has already obtained the appelLatioiL of canrd a 14a Tartare. .Despatches from :Berlin speak of a similar state of things, -and it is suapeea -that a -combination exists here and. in.Brussels for the fabrication of news, wzfh3 viewr to 1Bourse speculations. . The inddeaxda2ce has changedhands-withinthe last few days, but that; change does not entitle it to much credit, so -ar as accuracy is ce erned. The proeedngs o,f the Congress are -stl kept carefully guarded,, but it in known that there ae, several difficult points to be treated before * solution can be expected one way or the other. -What has been taken for the preliminaries of peace is.no.doubt the signature afficed. to.the. protol., of the nrmistice on Monday, -he paraphing the propositions of Austria, and the signatures adopting them as the basis -of negotiations. The Congress met again to-day, but nothing has transpired of its proceedings. - The Emperor's speech on opening the Chambers yesterday seems to have produced a very- favourable effect. Indeed,. I have heard asyst. but one opinion about it-namely, that it exhibits a, determination for either extremity, peace or war,) as circumstances sha&l decide. The allusion tQ the gal. lantry of the King of Piedmont is much .remarked, as aso5 that about drawing closer the, bonds of alliance with England. . - . Whatever maybe the issue of the Conferences the military, preparations -do not appear to be discontinned. I am assaured-that the number of troops to embark at Marseilles ifor the Crimea is 20,OQp, anc not 10,000, as statedl andc the orders to the trans. port agents in that port are for two years. - The following private telegraphic despatch hat been received "BXnr.nS, MAEOH S.-The Ncw Pr ian' e announces thttRussi%will ilow consulates to all the Powers thirports-Ortr1esIKClr5ieS7 thatsle-ggveasp tile idea vÃ¯Â¿Â½ the reconslraction of Bomarsund, and that the Western Powers abandon their demand on the subject of Nicholaieff; It also saysthat ance, Austria, and Russia are agreed on the fiflh point." A private letter from Stockholm of the 20th mentions as follors "For some time the questionof the Aland ailes has been often touched on in the journals, but never treated sesiously. It cerXainly deserves to be so treated, if the tranquiflity of the north and the liberty of the Baltic are to be seriously considered in the Paris Conferences. That omission is perhaps traceable to want of information as to the position and n-ature of that Archipelago, and a brief expla. nation onthe subject, showing its importance, may not be without interest. It must not be forgotten that these isles form in fact a tte-du-pont between Sweden and Russia, and vwhich, at scarcely 20 English miles distance, separates from our shores -this Muscovite advanced post, from which an invading army could easily reach our capital in two days' march. " The island of Aland, which gives its name to the entire group, is S0 English miles long and 21 broad. It has, moreover, aboaot 60 islets, which with it form eight parshes, anc they afford from 10 to 12 ports perfectly sheltered. The population of this cluster of islIs amounts to-about20,03), all of whom speak the lnguage and profess the religion of tbe country to which they belonged for such a period, and which first intr6dnced among them the dogmas of Christianity. For some centuries tbe Aland ISes were the rendec=ous of the Viidngs of the Bltic, and the dowry of the Queens of Sveden. Agriculture is as'yet very baclward there, -'ut the forests form an important article of trade with Sweden, and the fisheries furnish abundant resources. The natives are capital marlsmen, intrepid mariners, and especlally skilful pilots, well acquainted -with all the difficulties of navigation in that labyrinth of islets and rocks which protect the entrance to our capital. This is still more a dan_er which I take the liberty of pointing outtothe Powers that have gxaranteed the integritr of the Scandinavian kingdoms. "If it be.necessary to add to the arguments dictated by prudence those which generosity and justice suggest, I should ask of the gallant Frenchmen who behaved SD gloriously at the capture of Bomarsund vhether they have of the allies, its promptitude to throw off the Mfuscovite yoke, and its eagerness to embrace a change which would secure to them a better condition? These poor people have cruellyexpiated the frankness of their enthusiasmu. Sinea the departure of the French troops they have been exposel to such persecution, that a considerable nuinber hive emigrated, and still comning over to Sweden in search. of employment on our coast. From the severity of which theyr are now the objects even vhile Russia is othervwise occupied. *e may form some opinion of what their conadiiomi will be when peice will leave her at liberty to pursee her designs in the Baltic. "The danger ipotout there is imminent, and- the in. justice is great.. There is danger for Sweden- if-RussM} maintain her menacing proximity to oun coats. The in. justice isdflagrant if the unfortunate SAanders, wbose onlry crime consists in having reposed too much confidacre in tha power and magnanimity of France and Engiand, are abandoned without defence to the vengeance of am- implacabhl master. - "CIn a word, in the hands of Sweden -ljss archipelago i-a a pledge - of secudity for the-peace of tb ewnrld, an for th, maintenance of the political equflibrsmm of-te nrorth; isik those of Russia it is-a permaunent mewce-ag'anst ece of thot most ancient allies:of France, of one- of t.he most loyal nations of eiv'ilized Europe. - "Let diplomatists ti -well- the matter.

IRELAND. 1 THE flPPEIUY BANK. , (rxox ovR OWN 0OEEPSPONDZNT.) I DUIBION. MOlMAY:NiOP-l=(;. TEhe CI&rlow &Sstincl supplies the foflowing distrevssng detoails in connexion wvith7tthie. enbarrassments.0f the branch of the T ip.ueray Bak-.in the towsn of-Carlow. .The l6cality.ill bie msemor-able as the scene of* some of the 'leadig exploits in the politieal life of the deceased author of the calamities which have fallenl upon all who, unhappily for themnselves, placed faith in the itegrity of Mr. John Sadleir:. "The Carlow branch of the Tipperary Bank, which was open, T-hough transacting no business, since it suspended payment, was closed on Wy ednesday -last, we suppose by order of the directors. Daring the week notices of -payment were served by the depositors, many of whom appeared irta despor,ding state, :the profits of their industry being,, for :te present at least, -renderea tota'ly unavailing. The stoppa"e of this bank'has been att6nded with reat loss to the farmers and induskious poor people who, on ceount of the interest allowed on -the deposits, lodged: every ~shbfling they possessed in its several branches, under the impression that their Iodgnments were as secure as if placed an the coffers of the Bank of Ireland. .any heartrending cases have come to our knowledge during the week, but, in many inbtances, the depositors retired satisfied with the explanation of Mfr. igors, .the pro-manager. On Mondiy evening a boatman, named Butler, fromLeighlinbridge, who, after-years of patient toil, was enabled to lodge from -his savi'ngs a sum of l00L, to provide for the future support of an aged parent, applied for the amount of his deposit ,Ie could not be persuaded that the cash 3was not forth coming, and, :drawinga cord out of his pocket,-ihe threatened WtoU-5b-ihnselfon the sovot-unass aere paid.. Advice and remonstrance provinj of no avail, he was, at length, removed 'by a constable, who was called in for that purpose. Aschoolmaster, of the same town, was a loser to the amount of 2001,, but he bore his misfortune with great fortitude -ntillis return home, whenheannounced his loss, to the astonishmentof his neighbours, who did not believe him worth a shilling. The liability of this branch to the depositors is not as yet known, but a hope is entertained, at *the 'wind-np,' that assets will be available. -.The amount -of current and over-due bills in: iie Carlow branch is variously estimated, but we believe the amount to be very considerable, the greater -portion of which, it is supposed, wall not be available. At the 'wind-up' by the official assignees appointed under the act, the screw, we apprehend, wi be applied with vigour to many small traders in this town, who during a long period were connected with the political career of John Sad'ei. We have reason to know that much symnpathyis felt for M5r. deames Sadleir, who was, np to the last moment of the existence of his unfortunate brother, ignorant of the wicked career he had pursued, or of the enormous nature of the terrible specu',ationshehad been engaged in. M:r. John Sadleir's draughts were paid by the Tipperary Bank lup to a very recent period without the slightesthesitation. of course, the etent of those saction3s will soon become known to the assignees, to the shareholders, the depositors, andthe public." A statement which appeared in one of the Waterfordpapers, setting down the liabilities of the Tipperary Bank at 500,001., is regarded by commercial authorities as a random guess and, like many other reports, a probable exaggeration. The affair is thus alludedto in theweelrlytradeTeport of theFsuernase's ,Teurizl- ;1 If we were to hazard -what ean only be a guess, we should set down 300,0007 asnearer the amount of liabilities, and are disposed to think that good assets to the amount of at least 50,0001. 'will be found available in the bank Whether the deficiency which more or less is sure to exist can be recovered from the share list 'remains to be seen. Very little seems to bo Imowvn of the body of English shareholders, who are chiefly new entrants, the entire number of shareholders having been only, we believe, 37 a year ago. The frequently fluctuatmng character of the deposits and liabilities of a bank makes it in most cases almost needless to look back beyond the present list, as it may beinferred that very few of the present liabilities will attach to any shareholders who have gone out, especially if, as we have heard it stated, the deposit receipts were periodically called in and new ones issued. It is to be hoped, however, that before another week elapses the painful suspense which now iangs over the affairs of the bank may be Ued by some authoritative announcement. A high legfal opinion has been taken with respect to the issue of new deposit receipts in cases in which the deposit was not actually withdrawn, and it is said to be in favour of the depositor's claim on the outgoing shareholders, as such a system might be contrived to cover retiring shareholders." T 3EUR. OF _MS EM)S. TUp E th rDisoonerss H,Ws Upon the application of coumnel for the prisoners the trial of the parties charged with the murder of Miss Hinds has been postponed to the next sies, or to any intervening, commission that may occur. The Attorney-General strongly resisted the motion for postpo0nement, but Mr Justice Torrens was inexorabile,stating that he felt he should be unable to comle to a sstisiatiit3y- cOnclusion tlrubnne-l ofe the evidenee which 'was sworn as necessary for the defence of the prisoners. TEE I=ISH SOCXAL IEVOLUTIO0. The trade report in the Banner of V7ster points .out some of the advantages, hitherto everlooked, which have resulted from the operations of the Encumbered Estates Court, and the effects produced on the agricultural population: " T2rowing aside the immense additions made to the stock of food,the stimulusgivento the labour-market, and the rewards offered for self-exertion, the monetasry results of this landrevolution have been most extiraordinary. Starvation wages, even in the most backward districts of the country, have gradually died off;*theIrish peasantno longer exists on r.ots, ashe was wont to deoin the days of potato-eating, but is able to. consume a portion of excisable articles, in the shape of tea, sugar, and coffee, and he can aLso pur-r chase breadstnffs to an extent which, though under the average of his fellow-labourers of the sister isle, is stilisuch as to show a remarkable advance in his social position. These enidences of progress are very satisfactory, as tending to prove how much good the unlocking of Ireland's lands has done for those outside the pale of agriculture. The terrible effects of the farnine pressed with great severity on the currency of the upper districts of Ireland. Immediately before the opening of the State mart for the sale of lands-'sir, in 1849, the circlation of notes in this country had fallen to 3,8U,445L C-radually The lifeblood of comnmerce was extended, and, as agriculture became more successful and its products took a high range of valule, every phase of exchange was more or less stimulated. Seven years after the date at which the circulation of bank paper in Ireland had receded to the figures above noted, the same account showed a total of 6,S46,0001." The Irish Bank returns are Iunfavourable, there being a decrease of ]17,0007. in the circulation, Cwhile both in. 1854 and 1855 there wvas a considerable increase. The amnounts are noir nearly the samne as last year, but the gold isi about 200,0001. in ex;cess. These are the fig ures- - ~~~~~~Circulatisa.

C.AL: GHA. The terrible fate whbich has befallen this unfortunate gentleman caused a deep sensation in Dublin, -where he was long known as a practising solicitor in the office of the late Mfr. Pierce Mlraony, -who waqs for many years regarded as the head of the second branch of the legal profession. FRrom sll the letters which have come from the scene of the murder it rould appear that, in the exercise of the rights of property, Mr. Callaghan frequently exceeded the legitimate limits, and there is no0 doubt that some recent evictions of his tenants, including a Roman Clatho]ie clergyman (the landlord hiinself being a Roman Catholic), engendered the conspiracy which resuted in the sanguiinary tragedy of Friday night. One of the accounts which reached yesterday menlions that M. Callnghanl formnerly acted as receiver on the property of Whitegate,nearWoodford, which t hen belonlged to a gentleman named Martin, but the estate was subsequently brought into the Encumbered Court, arid there sold to MIr. Ca-llagha3i, 4who found it necessary to reduce-the number of the tanantry in occupation, and accorelilg,ly some of thenm ~were ejee.ted. Others wrere recently threatened with simnilar proceedings, and in order to-frustrate that intention the death of the unhappy man was docided upon. The Fs ceman- of this morniingf gives the following version of the-affair, which, although not differingmaterially fnom the previo&isaccounts, mentions circumstances not hitherto -revled: "We have just received an account of the lamentable end of the above-named gentlemnan, who, it is much, to be feared, fella victim to the private revenge of some unfortunate outcast evicted from a propeity which reently came into his hand. It is said that about 18 -nontlb ago Xr. Callsghsan came into -possession of this property, and that immediately after -he commenced proceedings for the}emoval of every occupant on it. Several ejectments were successfltly enrried out, and, whether correctljor not, rumu attribiites his death tÃ¯Â¿Â½the irrtation of some of thewretchee who were left honselcis ana homeless in a heartless, world. The aecountareceived in tow yesterday state tl:at hlr.

This cottage is a. newly. buil stuctue, nd r. Callaghan had apartments in it; fitted up for his ow Occasioal accommodation vhen visiti.ngthe estate. A reportb settingforth the detailsof the s& Occurrence, was forwarded to the Constabularyoffice, Dub. in Castle, on Saturday night last. It is stated that the-body of the usnhappy gentleman ws found lying near the Ehig Toad, stretched in a pool ofhisownblood,nad of mostbrutalviolence. The skall oftmurd g man was ab utelbeaten into the earth, a stones, numbers of whics of various size and stained ith blood, lay on the ground near the body It appears that some time since Mr. Callaghan becSne the purchaser of the estate of Ballinruane by a decree of sale under the Court cE Bankruptcy. On-coming into possession Mr. Calhan caused ejectinents tobe served on the tenants in Occupatoof holdins on the estate, and evictions took place innumerous instances. -nyof the tenants quietly surrenderedthar holdings, and among the rest a Catholic clergmanresiding inthe neighbourhood. Others,however, ofthe occpierswere osed to entertain bitter and indi ant feeligs at the moc'e bf managementadopted. 3frXalEglanprojected 'imVprovementr' iu the clearance way on a large scde oi the lands,' and made application to the constabulary authorities in Dublin for perrmission to erect a poice barrack on the estate at his own expense. This persion -would seem to have been accorded, nsa barrack was erecteda and occupied by a party of constabulary. The foundations of a mansion were also laid, and the building was in progress. - Last week a process was sued out against lr Callaghan by one of the tenants, an appeal was lodged, andl the unfortunate gentleman's business in the country on this occason was to sustain that appeal. e resided, as we havc said, in the cottage of his steward. It is stted that several angry and threatening lettezs had been received by Mr. 0sllagnhn from time to time,.and that in one of those ive3 he was warned not to show his face on the esate, or he should not leave it alive. The only notice he took of those threats was to establish a police barrck in the vicinity On Friday evenigilasthe went outomthe steward's cot. tage, sayn he would not be long absent; but as the-night advanced, the steward and his family, notfin 3 r. C n oyanzet gmnU, went to meet him, and at about 1 o'clock round his lifeless body near the high road, at about 250 yards from the cottage, lyingim a pool of blood. The body was removed to the cottage to await the coroner's inauest. Mfr. Callaghan has repeatedly been advised by friends not to proceed in the course he had marked out for himself, but it is said that on more than one occasion he replied by pointing to a revolver, and speaking of it as his protector.3 .A correspondent of another morning paper (the E4ress) writes as follows, under date of Lougbrea, Sunday might:-. III have this morning obtained more accurate detals of the dreadful affair with which I made you acquainted in my correspondence of 'last night. It turns out that Mr. Callaghan, who sometime ago purchased an estate situated at Wmitegate, in the Encumbered Estates Courts went to Galway on Friday morning to appeal gaiunst one or more processes served u,M him by certain of the tenants. He returned to Whitegate in the evening, and, as was hIs wont, proceeded to the house of his agent with -whom he was staying. Wishing to have some mik for his suPper, and there being none on the premises, ho. went out bor the purpose of directing'a female attendant to a cottage hard by where it might be procured. He proceeded about 50 yards, and then they separated. Wten' the woman returned with the mill, after a brief intmerval, to her great consternation, she found Mr. - Callaghan stretched upon the ground, weltering in his ovn blood. She, then discovered that immediately on parting from. her he had been pounced upon by some persons concealed in ambush, who' sought his destruction. The alarmwas given, and the Whitegate constabulary were soon on the spot. A pistol (loaded) was found on deceased. It would appear that he had endeavoured to drag it from his pocket, but in vain. Imayinformyou, on good authority, that in consequence of one or more evictions, to which Mr. Callaghan had most reluctantly been driven, threatening noticeshadpreviously reached him. Ifurther learn that he had been the subject of alta denunciations i. various parts of the country. It is said that a family connexdon exists between one of the evicted and the author, oÃ¯Â¿Â½ these last-mentioned proceedings." ADDRESSES OF CONDOLENCE. The grand jury of Westneath have presentec their address of conaolence to the Lord Chief-Justice Lefroy, to which his Lordship gave a suitable reply. The address vwas remarkable as bearing the signatures of one of the Radical representatives of the county (Mr. W. K. Ã¯Â¿Â½Iagan), four or five of the leading XVhig gentry, and one Romnan Catholic (Sir Percy Kugent). The King's County grand JUry was next on the roster, and the other counties on the home circuit -will doubtless follow in due season. DLSTRrUCrro2 Or BARTRY CASE WY . . The following is a fuller account of the destruction of Dartry Castle (the seat of Lord Cremorne) thans that which appearel in 1te Timnes of TueBday:- "Dartry, Sunday Night.-The fire by which the magnificent mansion of Lord Cremorne wvas consumed broke out about _11 o'cock e r n wh eaj exertions were made to extinguish it, and after some tume itwas conwsideredto be finally put out.. Unfortunately, however, such was not the case, for about 5 o'clock in the evening {fames were observed to burst through some of the windowsand, although the country folk to the number of many hundreds,. gathered together and gave active aEsistance in caryingmwater, the fircontinued to rage with unceasing violence, and very soon all hope of saving the castle wras abandoned. A mounted messenger was despatched to Mo1naghan for the tovrn - engine and that attached to the barracks of the same town, which arrived at 11 o'clock, and were set to vork to save the old part oz the Castle which the fire had not yet reached, and success fortunately attended their efforts. In the meantime all the paintings, some sculpture, the carpets, and the furniture, excepting that of the room in which the fire originated, were saved. The Castle has not been completed more than eight years, and was erected at a cost exceeding 40,0001. Lord Cremorne, it is said, devoted to it all the money which had accrued during his minority; and, as the insurance was but for 10,0001., as I understand, the pecuniary loss by the disaster will be extremely great'. HisLordship -was expected here in a short time, and the fire is believed to have originated in the airing of the rooms in expectation of that event.

NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY. iartl 'STANHOPE said that, in rising to bring forwazda he motio of which he hadc given notice for the ga1s=l formation of a gallery of portraits, he begged to hNtia ta thtis question was not altogether new to Parliamnest.- Foeryears since, just before. the last general election, -ad while he was a member of the House of Commons, !be introduced this project in a conversation on the miscellaneovsoesi,nates. A right hon. gentleman who represented -the Government at that time-it was the Government of the noble-easT (Derby)-expressed himself in approving terms of that prepoaL Other members expressed the same approbation, arn he was so far encouraged as to give - notice that, if be had the honour of a seat in the next House of Cornnoess, ihe vould bring the matter forward as a substantive moticn. He was not able to fulfil that pledge, because, as it chanced, he had not the good fortune to -obtain a seat, but now, although in another place, be would endeavour to redeem his pledge. He thought be could not better introduce this question to their lordrifps than by asking the greater number of them to recall to mind what they had seen in the galleries of foreign countries. Many among their lordships must have felt no small degree of weariness and disgust on passing through an almost interminable line of tawdry battle scenes of the largest diaensiohs at Versailles. Mfany of these battle scenes would no doubt recall the words of a modern author, who had ascribedtheni as "acres of spoilt canvass." Many such acres of spoiled canvass presented themselves uponthe walls of Versailles, but their lordships would also recollect 'the great pleasure, and as it were refreshment, with which theyhadpassedfromallthesetawdrybattle piecesandpageants into asinallergallery,lessgorgeouslydecorated,andcontaining Excellent contemporaryportraits of French celebrities. Few Englishmen could have been at Versailles without wishing that in our own country the errors of the larger gallery should be avoided, and the small gallery not only adopted but further extended. In this country the portraits of eur great historical characters were very numerous. He Zoubted, indeed, wihether in any country this-class of portraits so much abounded, but they were scattered far and wide-many of them in country houses and in private collections, and it was only now and then that a single portrait or a whole collection was exposed for sale. here were many advantages to be derived from forming zncli a gallery. The main recommendation was, that it Wouldafford great pleasure and instructiontothp industrious classes. It would also be a boon to men of letters; in proof ,of which he would read to their lordships a few sentences from one of the most thoughtful and eloquent writers of the present age, Mir. Thomas Carlyle. (Hear, hear.) In a letie;r published only a fewv months ago in the proceedings of alleared society at Edinburgh, Mr. Carlyle said:- " First of all, then, I have to tell you as a fact of personal experience, that in all mypoorhistorical investigations it has been, and always is, one of the most primary wants to procure-abodily likeness of the personage inquired aftera geod portrait if such exists; failing that, even an indifferent, -S 'ncero- one. In ablort, -n rorrocnatnn mae by a faithful human creature of that face and figure which he s.w-.vth his eyes, and which I can never see with mine, is now -valuable to me, and much better than none at alL This,-swhich is my own deep experience, I believe to be in a -dedper-orless-deep degree the universal one, and that every -atudent and reader of history who strives earnestly to con-ceive forhimself what manner of fact and man this or the *other vague hbistorical name can have been, will, as the first and directest'indication of all, search eagerly for a portraitfor all-the eeasonable portraits thero are; and will never rest ilPhe-avc -made out, if possible, what the man's natural 'face vwas-like. Often have I found a portrait Superior in -real instruction to half-a-dozen written biographies, as biographies are written; or, rather let me say. I have found that the portrait was as a small lighted candle, by which the biographies could for the first time be read, and some human interpretation be made of them." Anll, -fnrther- on, in the same letter, Mr. Carlyle adds on 1the moregeneral question:- "It has -always struck me that historical portrait galleries far transcend in worth all other kinds of national collectionsoÃ¯Â¿Â½pictures whatever; that, in fact, they ought to exist in .cvery country as among the most popular and cherished,national possessions. Lord Chancellor Clarendon madea-brave.attempt in that kind for England, but his house and;gallery fell asunder in a sad way, and as yet there has been no second attempt that I can hear of." 'ethought-theÃ¯Â¿Â½ testimony of so gifted a man as M[r. Carlyle .sh6uld be allowed to stand alone, though he could easily accumulatoot'ier authorities. (Hear, hear.) It might be -shewn-also-tha-tthe formation of suchagallery would be of Ã¯Â¿Â½.very great importance in the p-omotion of art. It would ibe of immense .advantage to portraitpainters to ho able to ce.in a:collecttd form a series of portraits of men famed in British history, from the first rude attempts of panel panting, in- theS3th or 14th century, down to the finished works of ReynoMz.and Lavwrence. It would enable them to -soar above the. mere attempt at reproducing a likeness, snd-to.give that l4gher tone which was essential to 4iaintain the.true dignity .of portrait painting. But to historical p:inters such a collection would be of still greater value. Theirlordships would no doubt recollect two great pictures -"The Executionaof Montrose" and "The Last Sleep of Argll"-for wbi4h a friend of his, M1r. Ward, had received commissions. Mr. Ward had told him that -it was ,scarcely possible to conceive how much .diffi.culty hi giad met ~.with in ascertaining the correct iiljeness, .ad the drass, and the decorations- of the ,time, inlp;eparing those two pictures. In a letter to Mr. ,ehaseapietusm of'Sir .W-tlter Raleigh'for the National -Gallery, Sir Charles EastUke, the President of the Royal AcaXl y,.&!d.-_ ITt-isok ,yor-for -yourireormation about the portrait of :Sir`WJter Rale+gh. F. or the National Gallery it is not, I-think, - ain pted. BuL whenever I hear of portraits *for sale, of historici interest, r cannot heol wishing that a gallery, could be fqzned exclu&.Tely for authentic likenesses ,of,celebraLed individinls, not necessarily with reference to -th menrit ef the wos of art. I believe that an extensive gaheg-of pcrtraits, -ith -catlo-es containing good and :short biograpisil noctic2s, would $be useful in many ways, .and espealys a not nzimporta element of education." AfÃ¯Â¿Â½er-nch testionjy it was not ,ecessary to say more in proof.ofthe advantages *vich-wouL&accrne to art from the esta1bliaient of sitchaqgallery -as ;lse had suggested. But thse was .aother ode in wiich,-Isa9khought, it would be valable, Jit would be useful as an,iMitement to honourable exartion.. - Thea' all a l2emal. the exclamation ascribed to Nelson, just hefore the battfeeof the Nile,-" A coronet, or. Westminster-abbeyh " Of a cmuinet he would say nothiig, le6t he ehould be supposed i0 esire to revive xecent debates;and, with respect to place i\WestminsterAbbey, it was as difficult to attin at a seat la their lord- sbips' house. (Hear, hear.) If thec thougkt ' a.tomb in Westminster-abbey wnz so inspiritig to sucEh a mind as Nelson's, at co great a moment, would not the Sa.Ie effect have been produced by the thought of -oneday ec 4yiog a place in the collection of portraits of his countrys wvor,hiess ale hope of honoutable tinction ser:ved at all times a,s an incentive to exertion. In the emphatic words of one of ithe -wisest and most sagacious men that ever lived, " ontetez.'2u fansmr conternni virl-tes." (Hear.) He had spoken of the advana. - tages from such a scheme. Their lordships had a right to require, and it was his duty to show, by what particular mens those advantages were to be secured. He should be sorr if the execution of the project were postponed untila 3sew Xational Gallery was erected. To plan, and still more to consktact, a National Gallery mut be a work of time, and if thc aallery were ready now, to place there the few pistures w slb at first could be obtained would give an ap. pe;s~nce bnot.nnsightly. He hoped Her Majesty's Governmeat would Wigagn some temporary apartments, either in Wrlborouigh-houso or in the l'alace of Westminster for the P,Irpqse, and tbtn the scheme could at an early ieriod be-commenced. The suppiy of Portraits woul4 t4E:rl: oz taP- Pn4e-prhse l prese'nts.- It ce-tfWp of which m a narsonas ncLu'n" 4m bae warranted, by the importance of the persons Wpresexited. Such a body actually existed in the Fine Arts Commission which was established by Sir R. Peel i the first year of his Administration, under whose direction and supervision most of' the decorations of the palace in which their lordships were assembled had been executed. The marble statues which ornamented one of the halls of that house had been placed there under the authority of that commission, of which Prince Albert, distinguishedl for his love ind patronage of art, was chairman, and Sir C. Eastlake as secretary. The commission had first to consider upen historical grounds who should be the. persons slected; next to consider upon artistic grounds what sculptorsshould be intrested vith the execution of the statues; anr thiey had also generaly to superintend and direct the progress of the work. He thought.that commission might be safely allowed to continue its functions, and even, to extend them in the direction wihich he proposed. Adverting to the quieston of expense, it would, of course, be a matter for the House of Commons to consider what should be the annual vote for such a purpose; but he was inclined to believe that, a building once obtained, a very moderate sum would suffice to provide the portraits worthy of being placed in it. He thought a vearly sum of' 500L. would be adequate, although, pelhap, lor the first year, a sum of 1,0001. might be necessary; but -it must be clearly understood that, in the event of the purchases made in any . one year not .requiring 'the whole stu voted by Parliament, the balance should remain as a fund for future purchases, as opportunities might occur, works of art not being always in constant suppiy. It might be necessary for him to give some grounds for his belief that much might be done, even. 'with the very moderate suns which he had mentioned; and therefore he would state a fewv case of remarkable portraits sold for small sums during the last few years. He had been present when a full-length portrait of Mr. Pitt by Gainsborough, an undoubted original, was sold by auction for 100 guineas. He might also mention a portrait of Chatham, of whom only three portraits were known to exist, which was sold to Sir R. Peel for 80 guineas. About 11 years ago the portrait of Blackstone, an engraving of which appeared in all editions of the learnediudge's Commasentares, was sold forBO guineas; and an original portrait of Mr. Percival was purchased by the late Sir R. Inglis for 401. Those instances justified himin believing that with a very moderate sum of money a Valuable collection of national portraits could be formed, but undoubtedly the body to whom the duty of expending that money:should be intrusted ought to exercise its power with care and dis. cerrunent. Another part of its duties would consist in deciding upon offers of presents which uight be mide. He believed from that source many valuable portraits might be expected, for since he had given notice ofhmis motion several noble peers had told him they were willing to make =resents to a national collectioD. When it was remem- ed how many of their lordships were descended from men famous in the history of this country, it was not unreasonable to expect valuable contributions' from those who possessed, as many did, four or five portraits of their eminent ancestors, and the honour of having a pLace assigned to such portraits in a national collection would'be a great incentive to such liberality. There might be other cases, too, where persons Possessing valuable portraits had no convenient place for them in their own houses, and -who would willingly bestow them upon a national collection suchashe (Earl Stanhope) suggested. The most careful supervision, however, would be required in deciding upon the acceptance or refusal of the offers of presents which wrould be made to the body exercising the supreme controL. He attached the greatest importance to the powrerof refusal, and believed the whole success of the undertaking would depend upon the proper exercise of 'that power, for if they admitted into a national collection Portraits of thse who possessed no adequate claim to such honour the inevitable conseqnence would be that the gallery would be deprived of all the distinction which he (Earl Stanhope) wished to see attached to it. The power of refusal must tierefore be necessarily exercisedin many cases, and should be facilitated by a; rule that inn case shouldthe portritofanylivingindividual be admitted into the gallery which he wished to see founded. He proposed that three-fourths of the votes of the committee of selection should be necessary for the acceptance and detention of a portrait, so as to have it heag upon the walls of the gallery. There was another questionnamely, whether the superintending body ought not to be allowed the power of parting with duplicates? Snpso a present of a portrait sent to the galery, and that thore was in the gallery at that time a portrait of the same person at the samne time of life, and, i fact, a kind of counterpart, it might be then in the pwer of the committee to receive the present, and to dispose of the portrait which they already possessed. But these were ints of detail with which it was not necessary to detain their lordships. He proposed to give a general power to the supenntending body to receive presents. He felt sure that a beginning would soon be made. If only a temporary apartment were erected, and only a grant of 1,0001. were made on the estimates of this year, he ventured to say the whole thing would be done; his opinion being, that such would be the popular favour with which this gallery would be regarded that there would be no want of portraits, but that donations would come in such considerable numbers that there would be no fear 'of the failure of the scheme. He only desired to see the project commenced. There were two collections of portraits in this country, about which it might be expected he should say something. It was some time ago thought that they might form the foundation of. a portrait gallery, such as he had described, outofthe collections at Hampton-court and the British'Museum, but there were obstacles to both. With regard to Hampton'court, he should be sorry to diminish the inducenient to make a summer's holyday excursion to see the ictures there, especially as regarded those who were - -eQ od within 0- v llc of Lndon d ic Ã¯Â¿Â½he greater part of the year. With respect to the British Museum, there were some portraits there, some of which were curious and some valuable, but many of them were ir-placed. Some persons proposed to transfer the whole of this collection to a national gallerv of portraits, but he did not think the whole of them would be worthy of a place there. It would be necessary to make a selection, and take the best and leave the worst. It might be a question whether this would be a fair course, and whether the trustees had a legal power to part with the pictures in their charge without the especial authority of an act of Parhament. He thought it better, therefore, to propose a collection of portraits irrespective of those two sources. He supposed it was unnecessary for him to state thatin the proposed collection it should be a fundamental condition that none but authentic portraits should be admitted, and that there should be no such imaginary characters as they saw on the walls of Holyrood-house, where there -was a long line of Scottish kings, all assumed to be painted before the art of oil painting was known in this country. All such imaginary portraits, he repeated, ought to find no place in the proposed gaUery. He thought he had now gone through all the princpal considerations which he-had wished to suggest to their lordships, and it only remained for him to apologize for having so long detained their lordships. But he thought that these questions were interesting to a great bodyofpersons. When they considered the great number of theor countrymen who were strugglng in the various walks of art, and intent on that rugged path that led to fame, he thought that some mark of sympathy and some encouragement should be given to their exertions. Depend upon it the time was past when, considering the education of the people of this country, they could disregard the refining influence of art. This truth was every day becoming more widely understood and acknowledged-that the fie arts, under true rules and guidance, were to be ranked not merely among the ornaments of human life, but among the appinted means for the elevation and improvement of the human mind. Believing- this to be a step in the right direction, and a movement in advance, he begged to move- " That a humble address be presented toHor aesty, that Her Majesty would be gradously pleasedto take into her Royal consideration, in counexion withsthe site of the presenthationalGallery, the practicabilityand expediency of aovning by degrees a galery of original portraits, such portraits to consist as far as possible of those persons who are most honourably commemorated in British history as warriors or asstatesmen, or in arts, inbliteraeur, or in science."~ The Marquis of hoNSoWrabE said, it would be unnecessary for him to address more than a few words to their lordahipa upon the subject to which his noble friend had adverted. In the outset he must say that such a proposition "-oulde o coeno' from any pmnsto with greater grace than from his noble friend, whose name had been so long connected witn purtsuits so honourable to himself and so boneficial to his country m the path of historical research Ho sawnno objection whatever tothe adoption of the motion agreeing as he'did with his noble friend that such a gallery | as this would materialy ilustrate the history of the nation; while it could not fail to administer to the gratification and delight of .all classes, descending even to the lowest. Hf there were one or two points on which he had any doubt before, they had been removed by the manner in which his noble friend had treated the subject. He understood that it was not intended in anyway to interfere with or diminish the sum now applied to the acquisition of objects of high art, or to expend less in that way than was now e-xpended. The first object of a national gallery ought to be the cultivation of public taste by acauiring the highest works of art of every country and of every time, so as to establish a standard of national taste, which would benefit not only the artist but the public. He should have hesi'tated to adopt the project of his noble friend if it had- involved an expenditure 'which would have alarmed the other- House of Parliament. He was therefore extremely glad to hear his noble friend state that he should propose no greater expenditure than 500L a-year after the gallery-was once formed. ' t the same time, if the gallery were founded, he agreed with his noble friend that a strong power of refusal as well as of. acceptance, should be vested in and exercised by those -who had the suprnerience of it. He wouldtsuggestthat the motion might be made somewhat more general, sO as to include some particular ases which St emed at present not to be provided for by th}e wrords " as <,tors or sttesmen." [The Earl of ELENBOROtrTGH.- "in<wyors mnd bishopc would be exccluded altogether."] ( *" ar," apd laughter.)| With that alteration there would be everydispenltion on the part of the Government to accede to the raO. son, and do their beet to carry it into effect.

The noble marquis has adverted ', boUse accidental inaccuracy with which my noble friend ha' drawn his resolutionl No doubt, as, it now stands, it would exclude all bishops and judges who have not at the same time been statesmen or literary men; it vould exclude many martyrs; it would practically exclude that man whom my noble friend, I am sure, well recollects andwhoseworthandextraordinaryqualitiesweallappieciated -I mean the late Archbishop of Canterbury-a man who approached nearer to perfection than any Christian bishop of whorn I have ever read in any time. Not only would the words of the resolution as they now stand exclude men like the late Archbishop of Canterbury-men of virtuous minds, who'have done the State great service-if they happened not to come within the particular division which is adopted here; but by the words; "most honourably commemorated iD British history," the resolution would, I regret to say, exclude many of the most remarkable men who have rendered the greatest Public Eervices recorded in English history. It wdula exclude Wolsey; it would exclude Bacon; it would exclude, the Duke of Marlborough.; it would exdude Cromwell; and many others who might. be enumerated. [ford BRoUGHAm '(with surprise), " Cromwell?']' Yes; I apprehend the words, " who are most honourably commemorated," would undoubtedly have that effect. I therefore hope my noble friend will adopt-the words I have placed before him, ' Thata hunible address be presented to ier Majesty, praying that she will ie graciously pleased to take into consideration the formation of a galery of portraits of the most eminent men in British history." By such a motion the whole object in view is entirely obtained. But when I consider the manner in which' my noble friend proposes that-this object shall ie carried into execution I differ from him altogether. This gallery is either to be regarded as a plaything-or as a matter of great public concern. I thik it should be looked upon in the latter light, and, therefore, a 0int of the greatest importance is, that you should exclude every man who has not the highest right of ad sion to this Temple of Fame. (Hear.) Mfynoble friend proposes that the Fine Arts Commission shall decide this. Now, it is not a question of fine arts at all (hear); it is a question of great men, not of great pictures. (Hear, hear.) If you realy mean to make this gallery a thing of importance; if you mean to excite the ambition of men, not only in the highest, hut in inferior stations of life; if you wish to divert their min7s from the sole contemplation of that which is to give them present advantage and worldly profit, and to make themi think of immortality and oft reward for their services in public estimation hereafter, you must take care that no persons are selected for a place in the gallery but those thoroughly approved by men competent to decide upon their merits. (Hear, hear.) As the funds must be provided by Parliament, perhaps the bestcommission would be one whichconsisted, say, ofthree members of the House of Commons wad two of this House, or twro members of the House of Commons and one member of this House ; and to that commission should be assigned the duty of naming the persons whose portraits are to be received. Such nomination having been made, the Fine Ats Commission would be properly employed in deciding in what manner the portraits of those persons should be obtained. If, however, we begin with the miserable pittance of 5001. a-year, and place the pictures in any little room that can be found, the thing will never be supported by the public, and will fail altogether. But, leaving this part of the subject, I repeat that I am most desirous to see established a commission of the description I have indicated, named after tle greatest consideration, and composed of persona in whnhci the public place the highest trust. No -man who looks to the PaSt or examines into the present state of public feeling I can failto see thatthere alwaysprevails the greatestpossible 'exaggerationwith respect to thevalue of the services of those who'live in or about cur own times (hear), and on this point the greatest errors maybe committed with the greatest honesty of purpose. The other day I happeed to be reading-Ben Jonson, and in his Disoveries 1ound these observations madebyhim, "Cicerowas the only wit whom the Roman people equalled with their emperors-ing,enie pr aiU. We have had men equal to him." And then he enumerates 16 persons, all havi lived within theprevious century, whom he places onthe same level with Cicero in literature and in eloquence. Ofthese 16 persons I may have heard, but I had totally forgotten nine. H" Hear," and laughter. I found them, certainly, by carefully looking through a biographical dictionary, but, in fact, their memories, like the memories of many other men distinguished in their own days, had altogether fallen through that sieve in which Time is constantly shaking the reputations of men. ("Hear,"andlaughter.) Therefore, if I might be supposed to be one of those persons decently acquainted with istory of whom the noble lord has spoken, and if I had been pasing through a TUery containing the portraits of those persons, I should have been continuaily asking, '- Who is hee' and then my noble friend would have tarned them all out. ("Hear," and laughter.) With respect to one of the persons mentioned by Ben Jonson as so distinguished, and as enual to Cicero in literature, eloquence; and poetry-namely, Sir Thomas Wyatt the elder-I never happened to have the good fortune to meet with the poetry of Sir Thomas Wyatt, but I find that FLeland speaks of it as equal to that of Dante and Petrarch; and no one has ever delighted himself by reading the Italian literature of those ages in which learning was revived but must have seen the most extravagant exaggerations in tho manner in which the writerh of that period spo'ke of prsons whose memory is altogether gone. (ear hear.}. Now, wo are not exempt from the failings which have oeset mankind in all ages. We are liable, like others, to exaggerate the reputations of those living in our on times or in times just preceding; and not only doIthink the precaution I have mentioned is necessary for the purpose of excluding persons not worthy to beintroducedinto such a gallery, but I must say it would be most advisable (though that is, no doubt, for our successors rather than for ourselves to decide) at distant periods of 20 or 30 years to appoint a commission of revision-a censorship, in fact-for the purpose of removing those who, through the erroneous judgment of their own contemporaries, have been improperly admitted. (Hear, hear.) It is in this manner, by guarding against the anibition of persons unfit to be admitted to such a collection, that we shall really make this gallery what we must desire that it should be-that is, an object of ambition to all; for all men would naturally desire that their portraits should be placed there, and that their names should be thus handed down to posterity. In endeavouring to obtain such a collection of portraits one difficulty will be experienced. Literary men are of a retiring disposition, and are not in the habit of having their portraits painted. The persons who do that are aldermen (a laugh), sheriffs, railway directors, rich grocers (renewed laughter), rich merchants, speculators, and wealthy Begent-street tradesmen. (Laughter.) These are the persons who get their faces pamted on canvass, and whose portraits illustrate or disfigure our annual exhibitions. (H Hear, hear," and a laugh.) The case is, however, different with hard-working, sensible men of literature. They, as I have already sad, do not go to have their portraits painted, and you can hardly go to a man and say to him, " Will you sit for your portrait, and when you are dead it may be that your representatives will bh asked to allow it to be hung in the national collection ?" There is, however, one suggestion which I wish to offer to the Governument, andc that is, that I think it would he desirable to introduce into Parliament a biU enablinggpublic bodies,and more especially colleges, and also inclividua in possession of. pictures which 'were heirlooms. not to sell them but to present them to this gallery. All the remarkable ecclesiastics, statesmen, and men of science of former times had their portraits in those receptacles alone which were furnished by public bodies, and my im- pression is, that men who hail ancestors worthy of the aonour, if the power were given to them, would themselves naturally feel desirous of presenting their 'portraits to the gallery. I shall say notinmg further than that I think that if the Government carry out this project, and studiously and carefully endeavour to secure the exclusion of alluworthy persons, so that admission to the gallery will be an object of emulation to all, and that it will be.in fact,a galery of the portraits of those who in all ages have deserved best of then country, they will have performed a great public service, and will have done agreat dealto induce mensoto actthat theymay deserve that which is the greatest of all honours-an association with the great men among their predecessors. (Cheers.) The Duke of ARGYLL thought that, as was always the ease, there was a geat deal of force in what had fallen from the noble earl, but he believed that he had a little overrated the effect of such a gallery in exciting men to exertion. It was true that the hope of that kind of immor tality which consisted in living in the memory of future generations was an incentive to honourable exertion, but he doubted whether having one's picture hung up provided a certainconfidence of obtinin ta immortality. Thisgallery would not be a mere order of merit for great men, but it would be an historical gallery, and he thought that it should include not only the pictures of the very first men of the age, but also thepictures of those by whom they had been Upported. Would it not be desirable to have a portrait of Wellington surrounded by portraits of those men who in actual life surrounded and su ported him, men such as Murray, Picton, or the late Lord Raglan, or the portrait of Nelson surrounded by men like Hardy and Co gwood? As to admission to the gallery, he thought that it wdeld he desirable not bnly that the portrait of no man should be admitted to the galr uighslftm,btThat none' shouldbe admtte until 2-5 ears after The death of the original. The Erl of CARNARVON was stionglv in favour of the formation of such a gallery, because it involved a grea- principle of conservatism, that men of eeminence should b; held up for the admiration and example of future ages As yet no such gallery had been publicly undertaken, although some private collections, such as those of the celebrated Lord Clarendon, the Duke ot Portland,- and the late Sir Robert Peel, had been commenced and carried on vith some success,'but nowhere in the metropolis was there' a place where men of the present age could publicly view the portraits ofthe representatives of bygone greatness. A gallery such as his noble friend had shadowed forth; formed, to all intents and purposes, a branch of the educa, tion of a great country; and he could not doubt that. i tored with the portraits of menwho had deserved well of their country, it would tend to strengthen the interest and de4en the reverence which Englishmen had been taught to feel for the history and constitution of their country. (Hear, hear.) The EArl of HARROW BY heartily concurred in supportin5the motion;* but expressed a hope that the people of this country wouzld not be induced to substitute for the old- glish notion of duty the continental ideas of fame ar, glory. . W Weg n tJ too bpt n the p>nent day toXblaon. forth hfdividual merit and individclu exertion, but he' tmsted that we should never give up our strong respect for duty in pursuit of the ignisfatum, glory. As a part of the historical education of the country, he would support the motion for a galle of rtraits; but he would not 'confine itto a few but would 7 'it into it all who had distinguished themselves, whether for good or evil, in the history of their conntry. Lord DUNGANNON supported tho motion, argaug that the contemplition of the portraits of great men occa. sioned emulation in the minds of those who looked upon them. He thought that the public thanks were due to Ihis noblefriend for having brought the question under the notice of their lordships Horue. Lord REDESDALE drew attention to the fact that, while their lordships by their resolution were about to determine to preserve the lational GI in its present site for national puxposes, the House of<mmous hadon the previous ever,ing, by a majority ef 2 to 64, passed the second reading of a bill the object of which was to obtain possession of that site, and to bur.ild an "Imperial loterl opon it. Lord COLCHESTER thought military men would be stimulated in the performanco of their duty by the knowledge that their portraits might be placed in a gaUery of the kmid it was proposed to create. Earl STANHOPE, in reply, qute concurred in the observations of the noble earl (theiarlof Ellenborough) and the noble marquis (the Marquis of Iansdowne) as to an alteration being necessary in the terms of his motion, if they were not sufficiently generaL With regard to the sum he had mentioned, hehadonly named it as u=fcient tomake a be. girming, but he hoped that, if his suggestions were carried into effect, the Government would eventually propose, and the House of Commons wouldvoie, a much larger sun. The resolution was then agreed to, the words "-such portraits to consist as far as possible of the most emment persons in British history" being substitnted for "those pyrsons who are most honourably cominemorated ia British 'JUSTICES OP THE PEACE (IRELAND). Viscount'DUNGANNON moved for returns relating to the number of persons qualified to act as justices of the peace in the several counties of Ireland. The' LORD CHANCELLOR and Lord xosmTsG-n pointed out that it would be dicicult, if not impossible, to obtain the information required by the motion; and Viscount DUJNGANKON said, he would not press it in its present form. The motion was accordingly withdrawn. Their lordships adjourned at 10 minutes after 7 o'clocl.

THE ANNEXATION OF OUDE. Mr. COBDEN asked the President of the Board of Control whether it was his intention to lay upon the table anv papers relating to the annexation of the ancient Mahomedan kingdom of Oude to our East Indian territory, or whether he iras prepared to offer any explanation on the subject to the House? Mr. Y. SMITH said that, as the business was not yet completed, it would be better not to lay the papers relating to it on the table. A despatch had been sent out to India stating the various-uodes in which the mal-adminisfcration ofthe kingdom of "Oude might be corrected, and leaving ifc to the discretion of the Marquis of Dalhousie which of these modes he would employ. 'No official reply had yefc been received to this despatch, and he should therefore not feel justified in producing any papers relating to the subject at present. - . THE FALL OF ___RS. - - Mr. WHITESIDE asked the First Lord of the Treasury on what.day the papers relating to the' fall of Kars would be laid oii the table of the house? Loid PAI_iEESTON, as a reply to the question, walked, to the bar and announced the papers referred to. (They were brought up and ordered to be laid on the table amid considerable cheering.) _____THE MA-JAN LEGION. Mr. BOWYER asked the First Lord of the Treasury what acconnts Her Majesty's Government hadreceived respecting the late arrests at Novara, arising from apprehended mutiny' in the-Anglo-Italian Legion ? also how long the legion was to remain in Piedmont, and what was its future destination in the event of peace being concluded ? ; lord PALMEESTON said, it was quite true that reports hsd prevailed in Sisifejpnt to the effect that there was » plot formed in one ofthe regiments of the Itali_n Legion i nd in consequence of that report 16 of the soldiers of thafc regiment had been arrested and submitted to an investigation by the Sardinian authorities. That plot, as far as Her Majesty's Government were informed, was not supposed to have for its object a disturbance or insurrection of any land in that countiy, but tho report was that a lar-_ sum of money had been sent from Lombardy to be dis. tributed among the soldiers to induce them to desert and to pass, oye-r into the territory of Lombardy. Uponmc-uW ihere did not appear to have been any foundation ror .hat report. Nothing had been discovered _> confirm the opinion that any plot whatever exis*^ i£-_ny of those regiments the conduct of -rrhich he Was bound to say had been from first to last, most ex.tnp.ary. (Hear, hear.) It was! however, thought better at onoe to carry into execution that which had always been intended, and, as there were about 3,000 men under arms, steps had been taken to remove them to Malta, the place for which theyhad been originally destined. Two regiments had already marched ; one of them had embarked when the last accounts arrived, and the other would most probably have embarked by this time. On their march nothing could exceed the order, good discipline and loyalty Jof thoBe troops towards the Government in whose pay they were serving. (Hear, hear.) . . METEOPOLIS IX3-AL MANAGEMENT BILL. In answer to questions from Mr. Butler and Mr T Duncombe, . Lord PALMEESTON said, he could not consent to posfc^ pone the second reading of this biH. Its object was simply to correct an oversight in thebill of last year, in consequence of anamendment hastily inserted in committee, the effect of which was to make it difficult, and even impossible in certainparishes, to raise the poor rates required for ihe parish. He was informed that it was of importance that this bill should be passed before Easter. '?'.'- THE EASTEE VACATION. In answer to _Cr.__o.N_R, Lord PALMEESTON said, .he thought it would be for the convenience of members in general that the Easter vacation ih*s year should be the same as that of last year, and he intended to propose, therefore, that the House shonld adjourn on Friday, the Uth inst., until Monday, the 31sfc inst. (Hear, hear.) THE SAUB OF COMRHSSIONS BS* THE ABMY. . Sir D. L. EVANS rose to move for a select committeB to c<__ider, examine evidence, and riport to the Houses on the expediency of abolishing the system of sale and purchase of commissions in thearmy, and on-the means that may be adopted for the accomplishment of that object. Thehon. and gallant member proceeded to address the House iu a tone indistinct throughout, and at times altogether inaudible. He was understood to commence by apologizing to the House for the very imperfect manner in which he felt ha was about to dischaige the duty he had ?undertaken. He had not been well for some time, but> as there was great difficulty in finding an opportunity for bringing forward motions of thiskind, he had determined to proceed now thathe had obtained a day, in the hope that other T!">mberswhotookan interest in the subject would supply hi; deficiencies. The object of his motion was the abolition by such means as might be deemed advisable of the system of the sale and purchase of commissions in the _cmy. Two returns had been Md on the table in reference to this subject, by one of which it appeared that 5,400,O00Z. had been paid for conimissions by officers now in the army, and inthe second return theamount was stated atS,O68,000_ To this must be added 40 per cent, for what was paid contrary to law, over and above the regulation price, so that according to the first return 8,000,000", and according to the second return 11,000,000?. was the value of the commissions now held by officers on full pay in the army. The imposition of such a tax as this on officers in ihe army could not be justified except on the strongest grounds. Ii defence of any abuse it was possible to allege many plausible reasons, and it was, therefore, not surprising that, in regard to this system, arguments had at elifferent times been used which had satisfied some minds that there ought to be no change. One of these was, that it was a very economical arrangement that an officer should by the salo of his commission retire from the service without the countiy being called upon to pension him. In considering the reason, however, it should be remembered that in consequence of this immense imposition upon officers, it was necessaiy, in fairness, to make the emoluments of offieeis in the higher ranks of the army much greater than they would otherwise be. If this system were abolished and officers were relieved from this heavy tax, the Government would have a rightto_r_____i theallowanceswhichwerenowmade to general officers and otheis in the higher ranks of the army. The late illustrious Duke of Wellington had left a memorandum upon the subject, in wbich he seemed to look upon the system of purchase somewhat iuthe light of a political institution, and defended it on the ground that it brought into the army men of the higher classes who had a stake in the countiy and were not likely to take part against its authorities or its institutions. He (Sir D. L. Evans) did not think there was mue-h in that reason. Althongh a system of purchase did not exist in the French army, yet that army had in most instances of popular excitement been found to be well disposed towards the authorities. It should also be remembered that this system was nofc introduced into the English army until the reign of Charles L_ ; and that 20 or 30 years afterwards one-half of the army abandoned the King. It. iherefore did not appear that loyalty was necessarily connected with a ^item of p-rchmse, or disloyalty with one of an opposite character. Lord Fitzroy Somerset, when militaiy secretary, gave other reasons against the adoption of a system of promotion by merit, the principal of which was, that in time of peace it would be almost impossible to discover where the superior merit was. He (Sir D. L. Evans) admitted that there would ba some difficulty in making the selection buthe thought thatit had been greatly exaggerated. As instances of the dif_culty which would occur if you were to depend upon the reports of officers commanding regiments Lord Fitzroy Somerset stud that one officer nnght think a man worthy of promotion because he was good at drill, while the reason of another inight be that tha officer recommended had a knowledge of languages, or was a proficient in drawing. To him (Sir D. L. Evans) it appeared that, ihese were all good ejualifications for promotion. The same noble lord to whom he had already referred was asked by the commissioners:- . . " Upon the whole, therefore, yon conceive it would be impossible, particularly in time of peace, to establish with anything like _atisfaction a *jystem of selection by merit, and that if you did attempt it, it would necesr-arrily degenerate into . system of seniority ?-Yes." He (Sir D. L. Evans) did not recognize the propriety of the expression "degenerate into a system of seniority." In the Artilleiy aH protaOtion was by seniority, and yet our artillery was about tho bert in iho world. (Hear.hear.) An important reason for the consideration of this subject at the present moment arose from the following recommendation, made in their report by the Coinmissioners on Promotion in the Army, about three years ago:"We beg leave humbly to recommend to your Majesty that in future, when the services of an officer are required to take the command of any portion of your Majesty's troops as a general officer, the fittest officer that can be found for the particular duty should be selected, withont refereuce to seniority, from the whole list of offieeis who have attained the rank of colonel or a superior rank." By a regulation now in force it was provided thafc an officer having obtained the rank of Heutenant-colonel, or an equal rank, should iu three years become a full colonel; therefore any gentleman who had purchased the rank of lieutenantcolonel would in three years be eligible tocouimandanarmy. Was t_i3 a reasonable system on which to conduct military affairs? He might be asked to what abuses he could point as resulting fromthe piresent system. Inhis opinion, notthe least was the miseiy and distress of mind occasioned to meritorious officers who had not funds with which to purchase their advancement. (Hear.) From his peisonal knowledge he could assert that many officers of great merit had from time to time given up all hope of advancement and left the anny because they were unable to buy promotion. (Hear.) The Housa could be at no loss to nnderstand how severe must be the sufferings and how bitter ihe reflections of meritorious officers who knew that, without money or mterest, they had little chance of advancement in their profession. In tima of war there might be some chance for such men, and, even in time of peace, it occasionally happened that some person high in authority took up the cause of a friendless officer ; but such cases were rare, and, as a general rule, neglect was the portion of officers who had neither money nor interest. (Hear, hear.) Nothing could be more dishonourable, both to the service and the countiy, than such a state of things, and it was now time to apply a remedy. There was no necessity to confiscate the properly of any class of officers or to put the er-unby to serious expense. The system would die out of itself if the Horse Guards would determine ihat for tho future no commission shonld be made the subject of purchase. Tliis, no doubt, would be a slow and tedious process, but it would not be difficult to devise some means of accelerating it; and to do so mora particularly with reference to the higher ranks of. the army would greatly conduce to the welfare of theservice. A system of-rretiring alleiwances might promote tiie desired object, and would probably be attended with the most beneficial results. Inducements of this Irind hadbeen found necessary in the navy, and why should they not be suitable for the army? Of this he was confident, that considerations of finance shouldnot be permitted to pirevad against the hitroduction of a better system than thepresent. There could be no worse economy than to maintain that system unchanged, for, if there shonld be au mconipetent general attheheadofthe anny in time of war, the disasters, occasioned by his incapacity niight in a single <;ampaign cover the expenditure of a peaoe army for two or three years together.- (Hear, hear.) The purchase system was-a dr-honourto the English army, and sooner or later it must be abolished. Its abolition was only a question of timc.and if not accomplished in this Parliament it wonld certainly be so in tlie next. It was a stain upon the service, and excitedtheguiprise but not the respect of foreign nations. Of rts evil effects the noblelord at the head of the Government must have had ample experience during his connexion with the War Department,- and his co-operation in a ??_ rational attempt to introduce a hetter system might be most, appropriately invoked. (Hear, hear) His ob.ect, therefore, was merely to induce the Houso to agree .to an inquiiy into tiie subject; and if the noble lord at the head of the Government thought that theend jn view would be better answered by the appointment of a cewmis-on (on which several ex-Secretaries at War might si), ma it could be by a select committee, he (SirDeL. Evans) would have no objection fomodify his inotSm. Witthat explanation he now begged to move the "resolution which stood ju his name. (Hear, hear.3 Yisconnt GODEKICH, in seconding the motion, observe*' that it was now almost universally admitted that the -rygtemof promotion in the army by purchase was, in the abstract-. indefensible. Indeed, the Pirst Lord ofthe TTreaBnry las. -ssion fi___]y Conceded that, in theory, ihe system -AS perfectly absurd, and no one could doubt that any private tm. dertakhig which shonld select its employes, not for theie specialiitness for their situations but fortheir wealth, mutt speedilyfind its way into the Gazette. However, the _rien_s ot thepresent modeof distributing comm_edons in the army while allowing that if looked at in the abstract it eouli easily be turned into ridicule, had recourse to one ingeniour*. argument in its sujiport-namely, ihat it bad worked we-Uand, therefore, ought not to be changed. Without pausihjt to inquire whether a practice involving so many instances. of injustice, such as those which the hon. and gallant general had mentioned, was fairly entitled to tiie credit of having worked well, tbere was no question that tha system. nnder which the officers of our army had for the most parfc to embark a large portion of iheir fortunes to obtain admission to their prof ession, was fraught with palpable and serious inconveniences. It had been truly remarked that thos* officers who had bought their commissi ons weie practicaHyr serving the oonntiy almost gratmtously, inasmuch as their pay little more than covered the legitimate amount of interest they would realize upon an equal outlay of capital in any other investment. The late Duke of Wellington, whoso: testimony on such a subject the advocates of the existing practice would hardly be disposed to reject, confirmed this representation ofthe systemof purchase before a committee of that House which sat in the year 1833. That iUustrious: man wrote thus to Lord ffill;" On the other hand, an examination of the detailed operation of the system of promotion hy purchase, or tha remuneration intended to be given by the public to thooffieeis Of the anny for iheir service, will show that thosa who purchase their commissions-which are certainly threefourths of the whole number-receive but littla for thdrservice besides the honour of serving the King. They receive from the public an annuity fdr which ihey have sacrificed a capital larger than any that could be required oE ihem, either by the public or any annuity office, forthesama aimuity. The officer has but little hope of promotion. unless he can purchase it." Such a state of things was surely inconsistent witbr the generous character of a great country, and eonl* not but prove a fertile souroe of evil. One of thamost obvious evils which attended it was the embarrassment which the vested rights created under the system. of purchase occasioned to all attempts at reform, how- ; ever desirable such reform might be for ihe interest* of the public service. This was-no mere imaginary difficultrj- " as the recent memorial presented by the colonels and lieutenant-colonels of the Guards to Hcr Majesty would testify. (Hear.) And let not the hon. and ^aHantmember for Wigait (Colonel Iindsay), whoso child this memorial was (a laugh) suppose that he (Lord Goderich) was now questioning his right to use the language in which it was couched. Alluding: to the changes introduced into the system of promotion lithe army by ihe warrant of October, 1854,theeemeiuoris_ist_i stated that :- " AU those who became captains and lieutenaniroolonels*. previously to the 17th of June, 1854, have it vested right toexpect that they shall rise to the rank of colonel in tiieirplace on the list, without having officers junior in rank tothemselves put over their heads. Moreover, the Tested. interests of these officers are rendered still stronger andi more important by their havinij been acquired under arrangements fixed by authority, and at prices higher than. those paid for the equivalent rank in the other branch or the service; or, in ihe words of the commissioners in theirreport, 'thoy hold the rank of lieutenant-colonel, tiieir commissions being exchangeable with lieutenant eolondcies of the line, on which account the regulated price of such commissions has been fixed and pud for by them at a higherr-rate.'" And, further," These ofiicers, having embarked their services and fortunes according to the established system of theservice^ have in strict justice and equity a claim to have tiieir interests respected." The same memorial also contained these remarkablo.- words;- " Your memorialists trust that your Majesiy will nobthink thej use too strong language in characterizing th*. course of proceeding thusad[opted and iUustrated ars:amounting to a breach of faith towards those who had risen to therank of lieutenant-colonel previously to the 17th of June, 1854, and who have invested their money in purehase ofT their promotion under the established rules of the service." (Hear, hear.) Without, then, disputing the right of thememorialists to plead their vested interests, it might fairlybe asserted that there was no other anny in the world the-- ofiicers of which would have been permitted to describe an_ order issued, after the report of a commission, by the Sovereign, acting under the advice of Her Ministers, as a breach-. of faith. (Hear, hear.) This, however, was the practicai. result of aUowing officers to acquire a pecuniary interestin their commissions. The. system, moreover, was not veryadvantageous, in an economicalI point of view, to the country. The pay of officers was, in fact, exactly the same as it wouldbe if the systemof purchase did not exist. That system. acted as a bar.to manyimportant improvementsin the army, and the most important and pressing of ihese improvementswas, in his opinion, some measure which would extend and. encourage among the offieeis the study of their professionHe believed that the practice of purchase had, directly and; positively, rendered it very difficult to introduce a sound. system of militaiy education, for officers were told in effect, "If you behave tolerably well, if you know so mucb. of yourprofession that it w_l not be disgraceful io promote youv and if you have money, you will get on; but. if yon study, if you are thoronghly acquainted with your profession, and _T you have nojnoney, the chanoes are that you will not succeed." That surely was not the way in which to encourago*. education in the anny. Now, he would bringthe existingTsystem to the test of facts, aud he would ask the House to consider what wasthe present state of mihtaiy professional education among the offieeis of the British army. He would read to. theHouse the opinion on this subject ofa durtinguished, intelligent, smd highly educated officer, Sir Howard Douglas^.. given before the Sandhurst Committee, since the debateswhich iook place ou the question during the last session of Parliament. The gallant officer was asked by lie hon. - member for Eichmond"You take the effect of many persons nofc being able topass the examination, which you state to be ridiculously low, as an indication that the education of the officers whowere admitted into the armypreviously to the institution of" such a test has been mischievously low?' Sir Howard Douglas replied, "Yes, certainly; that is= exactly the conclusion that I draw." The House, however,. must not suppose that the gallant offioer meant to say that the inquiries of the commission appointed some years agohad had the effect of changing that system of education*. which he admitted to be mischievously low. Upon this suh-- ject Sir Howard Douglas gave this explicit opinion :- "Iwas the person who recommended that measure. When I called the attention of the Honse of Commons tothe state of military learning, I stated that I thought there= should bo an examination, and I was prepared io go on withmy plan; but the Government too- it up very cordially, and, having professed a wish to take it into their own hands, I abandoned it to them. I was not consulted about the? matter, bnt I never could have contemplated anything soabsurd as that ridiculously trivial examination which theoffieeis entering the army undeigo now." It was clear that, inthe opinionof Sir Howard Douglas, that "ridiculously trivial examination" could not havamaterially' improved the system of education which. was previously '" mischievously low." Surely the Houses would confess that if the education of ofiicers ofthe British army was not what it ought to be, itwas of peculiar importance at the present day that the subject _hould receive most serious attention. (Hear, hear.)* If they looked to foreign countries it would be found that. of late years they had been making great strides in tkfe. respect; and every one who had read; the report of ihe committee and the statements in the appendix must lie awarsthat, within the last 20 years, the utmost attention had been. devoted by foreign Governments to the professional education of nulitary officers. (Hear.) It was not merely important that the professional-ejualifications of British, officersshould be maintained on an equality with those of officers oE" foreign States, but that, as the general education of ihapeople of this country was gradually rising, they should endeavour to raise proportionately the professional education. of peisons engaged in the different branches of the public? service. (Hear.) Foreign Governments were not so slow asour own in watching the progress of the times. Hewould ask pennission to read a remarkable passage from thepreamble of an ordinance which was issued in 1854 by the= Government of Prussia, appointing a new system of milit-ry education and a new mode of examination for all officers^ employed in the Prussian army. That ordinance stated, "The greater amount of professional knowledge, andr general culture which is now attained and met with inaIt ranks and employments renders necessaiy, inthe case of the profession of an officer, also, a change in the examination. and in ihe previous training of those who wish to dedicate themselves to that profession, in order that its dignity may' be maintained, and that its members may not find itdifficult to make an eventual change of profession." He wished the foresight of the Prussian Government had. been imitated by Her Majesty's Ministers, and that 12 years- - ago they had directed their attention to the professional. education of officers of the army. (Hear, hear.) It wasalleged by the supporters of the system of purchase that, ifit was indefensible in theory and substituted an absurd and false test for the trne test of merit, it had at least the advantage of leading to rapid promotion. It might be _u_that a system of purchaseled to more rapid promotion than. a system of pure seniority would do, and the Under- , Secretary for War seemed unable to perceive thafc. theire was any alternative for promotion by ;rj_-_aset ? except promotion by seniority; but those who advocated! : the abolition of the system of purchase, did notproposo t» substitute for it a pure system of seniority. If ihey turned. ' from a theoretical comparison of the ments of these systems , to the contemplation .of facts, they would find that the present system of military promotion, of which purchase- ? was so important an element, had at the commenceiment of '. ihe war given ihem generals of 70, and now gave therit captains of 18. (Hear, hear.) But if it were true that thesystem of purchase led to rapid promotion, why was the It was most important thatthey shonld have younggtmc-ds. but it mattered comparatively little what was the age of captsuns and subalterns. The commission of 1854 found, . however, that the system of purchase had filled ie> provide the army -with young generals. He thought indeed, that ihe system of promotion was jnst the reverse of what it ought to be, for they had nosenibrity where that principle might bo safely aeimitfed, in tha lower ranks of the army, whUe a slow and gradual system of seniority existed just where it was least desirable, and the conseeriuence was that men cf vigour and energy, in the prima of life, did not occupy high positions in the army. He did not know whether the hon. and g«_»nt member for Downpatrick (Colonel Hardinge), wha

In the House of Lords yesterday, The Earl of SHArSBURY gave notice that on th mnotion for the second reading of -the oChurch Disci pline Act Amendment Bill, he shDnld move that i be read a second time that day six mo iths.

No country was richer in portrits tha England, but at present they were scattered i many differentplaces, and were difficult of access. . very moderate sum would be sufficient to oommeru such a galery in a temporary bildinig, or, apar ments appropriated to it.

An old proverb says, with more force than e'legance, that you cannot make a silk purse out of a sows ear. No doubt, that is no easy task, but it would be still more difficult, in our opinion, to make a sow's ear out of a silk purse. We shall not say which of the materias thus compared applies most to the question before us, but it is evident the great difficulty that stares us reformers continually in the face is Ahe utter intractability of the natural material. Whatever-it is you have to' make in this country you always have certain articles put into your hand to make up as well as you can. Mr. BuTL deals with his lawmakers much as his economical spouse does with her dressmaker. She goes to half-adozen shops, and buys a piece of silk and the requisite quantities of trimming, lining, braiding, sewing silk, buttons, and the rest, and takes them to her dressmaker, whom she expects to assimilate the discordant elements into an effective dress, in spite of her protest that there is not enough of this, or of that, that the colours do not match, or the whole will be a failure. The task is much the same in the manufacture of any one of our institutions. Passingbythe rest, we will go at once to the army. In this instance you have your man of vealth, your man of ranL-, your corn-tier, your favourite at the Horse Guards, and here and there a man with a genius for his profession-you have your clodhopper, your mechanic, your snob, all to be worked up into a good army. Nothing is to be done but to make them all keep their places as well as you can, to keep the plouglman always worshipping the gentleman, to give the rich man something for his money, to make the upstart kiow his place, and to go into action, if not a good army, in the scientific sense of the word, at least a perfect specimen of the British community. Yes. They were no vulgar hirelings, no mere professional infantry and, cavalry, that the Russians saw in thae Crimea; ther were rather portions5 ,ofc.Engliish Eociety-a piece of Norfolk, or Dbrsetshire,.or: Yorkshire, as it might be. . Nor i3 it at all certain, t'hat anything else eould be-made out bf1them than is now made. It is a Chinese puzzlej. iin which the parts remain respectively unchanged, though combined into some sort-of unity. Hlow far-the presence of discordant materials, their . obstinate incongruity, the perpetual byplay of the parts,' and the episode which everyclass of the army expects to perform during .the drama of war, contribute tothe efficiency of the weapon, considered as a whole, may reasonably be doubted; but' it is not every combatant that' has the choice of his weapon,. and we certainly have not the choice of ours. That,. indeed, .was.. the prevailing 'sentiment last night. In the House of Commonis -ll-.the: mate- mials of the British commonweal ;are duly.repre. i sented, and full justice was done 'to-alL - Even: i though the speakers argued pro: nd "Mr. in the old approved fashion, yet - they. met oine another half-way, in the spirit of mutual accom- modation. They. are. all agreed isnadmiring a'. theoretical army, in which merit should be the rule of promotioi;. but even the theorists only asked for inquiry, and the defenders of things as ,they are prefaced: their speechesa.uniformly with the confession of OvI's frail beauty,-that they saw the better -course and preferred it.:-ut actually followed the worse. There. was always the same reply,-that,talk asmen mightof French equiality, Prussian science, and Austrian disciplinie, you could not do it -in this country, anid there was an end of it. In France everybody fancies himself an embryo .arshal, everybody is jealous of 'everybody else, everybody lights his cigar from 'everybody else!s cigar, everybody flirts with the regimental cantini&e, and, takes his turn:at her,eau'de *ie; so, of course, thereit is ino. great shock to.' anybody's feelings when the private finds himself the fellow-officer of his lieutenant. He was familiar enough before the change, aiid he is not much more familiar now. They neither of them possess much fortune, and if one of them has money and the other has not, the capitalist is content -to save,' and does not quarrel 'with a general rate of ! living' which perinits him to do so. To be sure, promotion is mighty slow. Tho. officers of the Granda Army hug their pay unto death, be it five francs a-day or' five-and-twenty; and their Juniors,if they chance to have money, cast an envious eye on the rapid promotion of. the young British " milords." Not but what this envy has its revenge when some French colonel at 30 meets a British celebrity on an important service, and, to his surprise, finds him a mere captain, or less, at 40 or more. On these occasions the - explanation is that the officer is only in the Engineers,.. or the Artillery,, which, of course, is, satisfactory to the intelligence and justice of a Frenchman. He sees the matter with French eyes, and we with English eyes.. Even among ourseles there is some diversity of vision on the subject. A man with neither money, norfriends, nor anything, except a little professional knowledge, is not alwvays. content to see his youngers' leap over his head, without the opportunity' of taldng -his turn over theirs.- It is a perpetual game of leapfrog, without its rotation. BUt, then,' ays that mOSt exemplary. defender of all established institutions, good, bad, and indifferent, Mr. F. PEEL, even the poor man gets his indirect benefit. The wealthy ones :buy and sell. As soon as they are tired of the army, or want some ready money, they sell out, and there is a general move upwards, in which even the poor man may 'possibly get a step.. You have thus, too, a perpetual succession of young officers. On a former occasion we have observed that this recomnmendation .unfortunately fails just at the point where it would be most important. There is no great harm in having your regimental officers men : 6f mature years, or, at all events, a little above the average age of ours. Nay, it is -rather-absurd to find in a. whole . mess _ not an-u officer who has smelt powder, except at a review. It is in the higher ranks, in' the command, that we occasionally want a little youthful- energy, - enterprise, invention, and fire. But that is just the place where purchase, with its rapid promotion, leaves us in the lurch, and the leaden rule ofseniority comes in. So there, at the -very- point, falls to the ground the chief argument for the present system. But it has occasionally happened that a jealous rule of exclusion has lost all its- force, not by assault from without, but by the very number of its defenders. In these days money is a test of continually decreasing severity. 'For one 'man who could pay a round sum for his' commtssion twenty years ago three can do it now. Even twenty years ago the sons of wealthy tradesmen found their way into the army, and even into crack regiments. Men whose fathers -had 'trades of a rather grotesque character, and whom it was impossible to divest of ridiculous associations, if they had tolerable.names, and lad gone through the ordeal of a public school and college, were admitted into the Guards, -and by force of money jumped over the heads of needy lords. this is an increasing class, for there is scarcely a man with his 5,0001. a-year who would not like 'to have at least one son in the army. What is to *Ie done, then, when the class becomes numerous? The only course is that which Sir Dn L&cy EvAas spoke of in his reply last night. We want a competition among the'- young millionaires-. themselves. When the wealthy cotton-spinner, and the wealthy tobacconist, and the wealthy railway speculator, and, the wealthy shipowner, and the wealthy upholsterer have all asked for commissions for their sons, with money in their 'hands, let the preference be given to the one who' shows some knowledge of the profession -he professes to choose. We have, no objection to wealthy officers, still less to young, lords. But of the class, caeri,s pa-Hus, as they say" at the Universities, we prefer :a wealthy soldier to a wealthy fooL Cannot we have some security that, even without the extinction of 'the system of purchase, and without having to buy for - the nation every bought comnission in the army, the best man will still step into the vacancy, in whatever rankk ? We will not do so great a dishonour 'to our country as -to suppose that this is wholly out of the question.
TYesterday we took occasion to remark oh an event which has consolidated the power of Britain in the far East; to-day we have equal, if not greater pleasure, in pointing public attention to *an equally gratifying proof of the fitmness and durability of our empire in the remote West. We really seem at last to have solved the problem, so long deemed insoluble, how -to retain a Colonial dependency under the dominion of the mother country, without violence and without coercion, by the niere strength of mutual interests and mutual benefits. That a perfectly free community-governed by institutions more democratic than our own, and well knowing that, should it fi its mind u-vpon separation from us, that separation can be obtained by the mere expression of its'wil-- should cling closely to our side, should rival us in loyalty to our QuEF and respect for our institutions, is a spectacle at once so striking and so gratifying as to deserve more than ordinary 'men- tion from those whose duty itis to chronicle the, noteworthy events of the time. Itis not that-Cnada enjcya from us any peculiar advantages-for sheLhaa to compete in ourumarkets againstthe whole w9rldK -nor yet that she rec'ives fr6.m us any .very.efficient ,military protection, for the .Ovmwor-!Gmtzn, whenhe6:went to 6pen, the Legisictive C,ouncil and. -Aasembly'at>Toronto, was' escbrted by CanadianVolunteers and saluted, by a salvo -from Canadian.Artifletymen..

Can this Canada-really be the samne Canada, the same. land of endiess discontents ancl mise-res, tthat burst out into armedrebellion less than 20 years ago, and was- only prevented by the sternesf acts of minitary.repression from throwing itself in;t the arms of the American UJnion, and following in 1837 the example ofÃ¯Â¿Â½ I776 ? Can this be the Canada whose Assemblies were for ever stopping the supplies; impeaching- their Governors, passing mutinous and,- even treasonable addresses,: and abandoning themselves to be led at will by the most empty and most: furious of demagogues P Can this be the- Canada, :poor and desertwithout capital and -without credit-.whose scanty. population required, an, army to keep them down-whose _ fortresses could -not - be entrusted except.- to British .troops-whose counsels must not, be swayed exeept by British statesmen? The land -is the same and tlhe people are the samee; the difference is in us-in our rules-of action-in,ourlaws-andsystemof government.. Step by step has the Liberal party won for Canada, in spite of the most determinred opposition, the liberties and privileges which have made her happy, great, and prosperous. The - act for uniting -the two - provinces and constituting a single Legislature- for both, was shorn of many of its most valuable. provisions by the Tory party of that day, and Parliament has ever since been employed in coTnceding, piecemeal, rights which ought never for a moment to. have been - withheld. The power of dealing witl4 theC,ivil Lit .was conceded in 1847, but-it was only after - a long and eager struagle that Parliainent could be prevailed upon to grant the ?much 'esired right of dealing with questions of religious endow-- 'ments according to eolonial rather than Imperial ideas, involved in- the passing of -the-bill tosecularize the Clergy-PReserives. It is one of the many blessings which attended on Lord Danny's exit from power that it prevented the transmission of a despat'ch'to Canada depriving the co6$nists of all- :hope - -of dealing - with : what they 'ustly comid6rodl---oloxiaa - and --not- -TIDerial property. With - 'equal- difficulty was, the right- to deal :'viith seigniorial: tenures.- and -to modify the- Canadian constitution w1 rung from. the grasp of the'-English' Tories. .It may, indeed, :be doubted whether this last measure will ibe carried into;effect,.- for: the-Assembly has tasted the sweets of absolute poweri, and will not be readily induced.to 'substitute for the weik cieck of a n6minated ;chamiber the efficient countebrpoise of' another popular assembly. . But we have 'done wen in conceding the right, whether . that-right be immediutely exercise-d or no. Thus, then, -it has core to pass that wealth and prosperity have fixed their abode in Canada, and that a Governor who is escorted by native volun-teers speaks, in the name of Hin MAjzsru-, to the Parliament with a- 'force and authority which all - the -.bayonets of- the British army could nuever have conferred upon him. Here we have. the most signal and -decisive instance of the worling of the principles professed by the two parties between which the.Legislature and thecountry -are divided. It seems hardly credlible, considering the faMibility of humnan nature, that one party shoutd have been so entirely right, and the, other so. uniformly and perseveringly wrong. And yet the men who would, had -their blind. and ;narrow counsels been listened to, have prevented all this . happiness,- have perpetuated all this misery, and alienated for ever from us thatnoble community-oursureat ally and our strongest support-sti rank nTnong - the leaders of party, still form .and govern- public opinion among large masses of mnen, and are neither discredited by their own incapacity norput to shame by the manifest and disg,raceful failure of their .own measures. England.forgives them all? and may, for aught we know, intrust to Lord Danny and his companions:again the power-that hdhas used to fetter her commerce, to. alienate her colonies, to che-cL every liberal impulso,-and-arrest the progress.of every enlighteaed Yneasure.

That fine old- institution, Dr. A-DPuw S3nrl, is still to be kept up. We congratulate the country that, whatever maybe thezresult of the.inquiry before the Board of General Officers, the chief of, the Mledical Department is at least respected. The answer returned on Monday night by Mr. FasnDXrCn Tkim to 31r. STAMFOiD is- decisive on the point. V While -the war was at its height it was necessary to. retain Dr. AxDnRw Smr until a successor was appointed; when the prospect of. peace retumned it.was equally proper to retain our dear . friend,.because no extraordinary ability was required- for the fulfilment of his duties. Whether it be .shut or open, there is always a row of purple bottles over the , wndows. of the temple of our British JANus.

WeL need scareely say, when with dry eyes, we can contemplate' uch. a contingency as that, no human consideration can stand between us and the expression of, what iwe believe til be the, truth. ' , Now, these specls upon the sun-these shoAcomings 'of our gre'at mediciner-have been 'noticed ,by observers 'in the Crimea as well as by ourselvos. Professors NNE=N and Tumocn have ~mtaakea the phenomena, just as we have done at homo. Among the, points to which their mqunes were more particularly directed 'when they were in the camp before Sebastopol was tha supply of medicines and medical- comforts to the army. Strange to say, well-nigh every Lone of. 'the regimental surgeons whose, testimony was taken deposed 'to tho miserable conditioxn to which they had been reduced through the want of drugs and of those articles which are included under the- general'-head of "'medical comforts." 'When, in the cholera time, they alplied for 'brandy, ih6y were ,told' "to try rum, as therevwas no brandy-in store." Sugar naud arrowroot were 'often not procurable. The most essential medicines, suich as opium, chalk powder, aromatic spirits of ammonia, &e., were 'wanting in. the chour of need. The testimony. upon this point of the worlking surgeons,-of the men who were brought into absolute contact :with the, ick soldiers,;.'is'contiied iHi thirteen pages of the- Crimean. Report,'-pp'.'30518; ,and - herein wiIl:. be found, the statements -which` have induced us most reluctantly 'to. como to the conclusion that Dr. Aimxwv 5.mS 'is 'not 'equal t' his former self. 'Mr. JOHN WAzTr, Senior Assift6nt-Surieon, Coldstream Guards, ')ays 'that during the period Ie was, in charge o' theo-.battalioni:"ftheohospital ', was only partially supplied with medicines! and cmedical often ctheofailaf.hwsbeen in "'tha most essential'requisites :for fieldserv;ice." Dr. FPnE:rUc:'Ro,Bsson, Senior Assistant.surgeon, Scots Fusileer Guards, says that his hospital was only. "regularly' supplied with' medicine and "medical comforts -since- the month of March"; "previous to- then always in very inadequate only one m'ore of these medical testimonies, which are taken at random from the firgt t-wo of the pages indicated in the- evidence. Any one who will be at the pains of consulting the' blue-book for himself will find that 'just such as the por-- tion we quote is the evidence throughout. Dr. E. ML H.. BLAKE, Surgeon of the 55th Regiment, is the seventh surgeon whose testimony is given. Here it is :-" Alm6st from the day of landing in "the Crimea till the'middle of February there "was great difficulty, and often an impossibility, "in obtaining an adequate supply of medicines "and medical- comforts. -' The medicines most "difficult to obtain were opium and its prepara"tions, castor 'oil, and vegetable astringents." Were it worth while, we could fill column after column with evidence of this kind; 'but there it is, open to anybody who will be at the pain5 of casting his eye over it. Many of the deposing surgeons give horrible particulars' ofj the straits to which. they were reduced in the cholera time. They ' had occasion' sometimes to treat their patients at the dead of night without candles, without medicines, without' comforts of any kind such as their situation required. Thank GOD this is over. The imagination shrinks from the contemplation of the chill hospital tent; with its stricken patients, as it must have presented itself to the eye of an observer in 'the cold gray dawn of December, 1854.- Here, then, we say, is perilous testimony against Dr. A2w'nEw Sanra. Why were not the aedicines and medical comforts required for the uso of the army forthcoming in the hour of need? It is in vain in such a case as this to throw the blame upon the Transport Service, or the Admiralty, or the people at Balaldava. There was a duty which involved the lives of the British army to be performed, and it was not aDerFonxOeVd& If it bo -woreh -wht eto l;eep' 'ui such an officer at all as the Medical.

I CIFII, SERVICE SUPERAKNNATIOZ. This committee met yesterday in Reom go. 12; the Chan. celior of the Exdhequer in the chair. Sir C. Trevelyan was again under examination during the whole of the day, and his evidence was in continuation of that given on the previous occasion, and teudei to show the great injiustice of the present system of deduction from the salaries of one portion of the civil servants of the Crovn for the purpose of forming a superannuation fund for tho whole. He stated, in answer to several questions by different members of the committee, that there should either ba one universal system of superannuation, or of free pensionsgranted bythe State, and, of the two, he infnitelypreferred the latter. He said again, as he had done-on his first examination, that his opimnon was decidedly against any abatement from salaries for sueannuation allowance, and in favour of its total abolition. Sir. C. Trevelyan read several statements and returns bearing upon the subject under consideration, and went on to mention varions circumstances, showing the evils of the present system, both as regarded the civil servants themselves, and also the efficient workin- of the public service. At 4 o'clockltewemnttee adjourned until Friday next at 12 o'clock.

Among theonassengers are the EHong. F. N~orth, Captain Champion, l;ieutenant WVanchope, Captain Ancon, Adia Sir Misbaei Seymour, and 1ientenant G. C. Fowler. The Ava, Captain FSeld, with the homewardportion of the India, Chia, and Mediterranean mails, is e.xpected about the 6th inst. The Tagus, Captain Wiecs, will convey the mails to Vigo, Oporto, Lisbon Cadiz, and Gibraltar, on the 7th inst. The Snltan, Captain Evans, with the homeward mails from these ports, is expected to morrow. The Royal Mail Company's steamer Parauns, Captain Baynton, which was due at this oort with the West India, Mexican, and Pacific mails on the1st inst. is not expected for a day or twio, in conseqaence of the delay she experienced on the ontward voyage by being compelled from heavy weather to put into lMadeira for coals, wihich p lace uhe did not leave for St. Thomas ntil the 2Sth ult., being :il daysa from Southampton, RyfIiD Engcrxcg.-ThdfEon. G. H. Eeathcote,. son of the retiring member, now a peer, was yesterday elected,atOakham,withoutopposition,torepresentthe county ofRutland. Hewasnominated by Mr.Eagleton, and seconded by Mlr. C. 0. Eaton. The newmember, inxeturning thanks, said, be was anx ous topromote moderate reforms and retrenchment in the public expenditure. He was a friend to r education. As to the ballot, he should oppose it, caua he believed it tobe un-English in its character. He should always take an interest in the prosperity of agricultare. Pfr. Meatheote added that he desired peace, but, considering the magnitude of our prepartions for war, he thought we should be foolishtoconcludeapeacewhichmight not be real and lasting. Supposing peaceto be declared, he should notwish to see too greata reduction of our army, and especially of the Artillery, whicn could not be trained in a day. He was of opinion that the army had been too much reduced before the war. Although he was not so straight3aced as to object to innocent recreation on the Sabbath, yet he was opposed to the opening of museums and other exhibitions on-that day. - Three cheers were given for the new member at the conchision of his speech.

The hospital of Yenikani contains only 900 patients' in all Severe cold prevails in the Crim-a. The last ac4 counts state that Fort St. Paul has been eestroyedT and that the Quarantine is mined, and will shortly share the same The Consfitudionnel says " We are assured that tho widow of fidmiral Braat has been designated for the high position of governess! to the expected infant of France, and that Mad3me de Brancion, widow of the Colonel kiled before Sebastopol, is to bo sub. gove7uess." The Emp7eror has Just given his sanction to the draught of a bill fo advancing 100,000,OOO f to agriculturists, to be employed in clrainiiig, and it h3s been sent to the Council of State to be examined, in order to be submitted to the Legislative Body. Files of the C(eimtn., a French journal of the island of Mauritius, to the 25th of December have been received. We read in them that on the 3d of December, the day fixed for the signing of tnepetition to the Government praying for the re-establishment of the French language in official and judicial documents, a crowd of colonists thronged the Hall of Commerce with enthusiasm to sign their names. -We also find an account of the following deplorable affair at Madaggascar .- " Eight Frenchmen-one of them, M dArvoy,>formerly FrenlConsulintheMaitiu-who hadb-enreddingalmeot ayearintheBayof Vavatonbu,worldng a caalminebelonging toa company, anda great number of Sacalavesintheirservice, were attacked in the night of the 19th of October by from 1,500 to 2,000 Hovas, the regular troops of the Queen of Madagascar, and, with the exception of one Frenchman, were barbarously murdered and mutilatedL The establishment -which they occupied was sacked, and 100 workmen wvho had escaped the massacre were, together with the Frenchmen made prisoners, carried off to Bnyrne. Five pieces of cannon, a quantity of muskets, and some gunpowder were captured by the assailants. The. material damace done amounted to between 70,000 and 80,000 pias. tres (;350,OOOf. to 400,00QÃ¯Â¿Â½). The Queen of Madagascar, lanavala, on receiving the news of the nassacre and capture, assembled the people of- her capital, aud read to them the deapatch of the Genera1. Ywlf commanded the expedition, after which she casned- seven guns to bo fired m honour of what she called the victory gained by her invincible troops over tho French." The Bay of VavatoubW and all the north-west p art of Madagascar is, according to the Cerngen, rench territory. It belongs to France, not only in virtue of her ancient claims on Mladagascar, but in virtue of a recent concession of the ee-King of Nos3i Be, who held it defado. Moreover, a fort which formed part of the estabEsliment destroyed was -built with the sanction of the French-Government, and under a promise of its protection, and two of the five guns captured were supplied by the French frigate Erigone. The Ceruiem accordinglydeclaresthat, apart from the barbaroiusoutrage on Frenchmen, the French fag has been groisly insilIted, and it intimates that no- doubt the Jainperial Government will take due vengeance. There is no change in the state of cornamerciaI affairs at Paris. -In the meantime shopkeepers continue their preparations on a nore- extensive scale than usual, in anticipation of the speedy reestablishment of peace. Parisian manufacturers have received important promises for that period, but hitherto purchasers have kept back, and orders which generally arrive in the beginning of February are not yet forthcoming. Some houses, however, have already been favoured withimportaut demands from Russia, particularly in the provinces, at,Lyons and Tarare, which formerly found at St. Peters. burg a ready and profitable market for their goods. The accounts from the industrial di.tricts generally are satisfactory. Themanufacturers of Lyons, being obEged to submit to a considerable rise hi the price of the raw material, have been compelled to increase that of their silks. Cotton and woollen-stuffs have likewise risen from a similar cause at Rouen, Mulhouse, and Roubaix. Several attempts were made this week in the Paris corn-market to create an advance in rates; but, sales becoming difficAlt, and the advices from the departments reporting a general downward tendency, speculators and millers had to abate their pretensions in order to dispose of their stock. Information derived from official sources states that the quantity of flour and wheat now depositecd inthe Government bonding-stores exceeds 600,000 metrical quintals, and that f urther supplies are expected from Spain and North America. The best sorts of flour are offered inParis for 90f. and 911. the 157 kilogrammes, and good flour may behad at from 88f. to 90f. The stock remaining inthe halle on Saturday amounted to 36,631 metrical quintals. Transactions in wheat were very linited, the price being If. 50c. lower than last weedk. In the usual monthly return of the average price of wheat in the different markets of France at the Clatter end of January and during the first foitnight of February the highest is 32f. 49c. per hectolitro at Bergues, Arras, Soissons, Rouen, and. Paris, and the lowest, 291. 21c., inthe markets of Brittany. The average for the whole country wa: 30. 40c., being a reduction of 2f. 7e. on the average price on the 24th of JanuaTy last. In the markets from which Paris derives its supplies the average fall 'eas 3f. 38c. per hectolitre. The accounts from all parts of the countrymention that the crops generally present the most favourable aspect. The price of beef mPanis was assized on the 1st inst. 6c. higher per kilogramme than last fortnight; but that of -veal, which had for several months gradually augmnented, is lower by Sc., and that of mutton by 9c. The winemarket at Bercy is very cal. The wines of Lower Burgundy and Touraine have undergon.e a slight diminution, but all the others are wvithout variation, and the tune of the market even remnains very firmn. The price of brandy had slightly odvancedS in the beginning of the week, but, offers being :aumerous, it receded from 162f. to 160f. per hectulire, adthat of spirits extracted from beet from 100I. to 99f.

MOÃ¯Â¿Â½AB RBKET and CITY ITBLLWEBNaB. Tuesda E"ane The quotation of geold at Paris is about 6 per mile premium (according to the last tari,f) which, at the English Mint price -of 31. 17a. lkd. per oz. for standard gsld, gives an exchange of 25.32; and, the exchange. at Paris on London at short being 25.3, it follows that gold is about 0.22 per cent. dearer in London than in Paris. By advices from Hamburg the price of gold is 426> per msrk, which, at the English- Mint price of 3S. 17s. 10id. per oz. for standard gold, gives an exchange of 13.5k; and, the exchange at Hamburg on London at short being 13.8, it follows that gold is 1.10 per cent. dearer in London than in Hamburg. The course of exchange at Neiw York on London for bills 3t 60 days' siht is 109k per cent., and, the par or exchange between England and America being 109 2S.40 per cent., it follows that the exchange is nominally 0.83 per cent. against Eng. land; but, after makinÃ¯Â¿Â½ allowance for charges of ftanvort and diference of interest, the present rate leaves no profit on the transmission of gold either way between the two countries. The English funds opened with' an appearance of dulness this morning, chiefly in consequence of French Rentes having dedined yesterday after the speoch of the Emperor to 'the Legislative Assembly. In the course of the day there was a good demand for stock on the part of the public, and prices experie-ieed a recovery, which was fairly maintained to the close of business. Consols for money, which left off last evening at 91i to i, were firstquoted 910 to i. From this they advanced to 91-j, and the final quotation was 91H to i. The next account is fixed lor the 10th of April, and the last transactions for that period were at 92. Bank Stock left off at 214to 215 ; Reduced, 92 to i; NewThreeper Cents., 924 to 03; Long Annuities, 3 9-16; Annuities, 18S5, 1G to 17; India Stock, 222 to 225; Indiabond, 6s. to 2s. discount; Exchequer-bonds, 981 to 9, and Eachequer-bills, (March), 3s. to is. discount; June, 2s. discount to Is. premiua. The commercial payments falling due to-day, although heavy and extensive, were extremely well met. At the Bank of England and in the discountmarket the demand for money was very active, but without any signs of difliculty. In the Stock-Exchange the rate for advances on Government securities was 5 per cent. Therelhas been an increased amount of business in foreign securities, and prices continuRe to be maintained with firmness. Turkish Six per Cents. for the account have been negotiated at 96, 96g, }, and i, and theFour per Cent. Guaranteed Stock at 1000 for money and OO and i for the account. The general operations have comprised-Buenos Ayres, for. account, 57, 58, 56X-, and 57; Chilian Three per Cents., 68; EcuadorNew Consolidated, 13I-; Provisional Land Warrant, 4 ; Granada Nev Active, 20k and 21,; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 80 and 79i; Russian Four-and-a-Hailf per Cents., 93g; Sp.ansh Passive, Gj; Venezuela, 29; andfDatch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 63g-. lh the foreign exchanges this afternoon there was a firther advance in the rate upon Holland. Bills on Vienna and Trieste were in demand. With regard to other places thiere was no change of impornce. The closing quotation of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening was 73f. 45c. for the end of the month, showing an improvement of nearly a quarter per cent. At Amsterdam the market exhibits a tendency to increased firmness, and Spanish and Portuguese have each experienced an advance of a half per cent. At Vienma likewise the indications are favourable, the funds having slightly risen, while in the rate of exchange onlondon there has been a faln of nearly one and a half per cent. Of the 140,0001. brought by the Persia yesterday about 60,0001. was on French account, and the remainder has been purchased for transmission to Paris. A bill, brought in by hIr. Apsley Pellatt, to remn6ve all the difficulties and doubts lately complained of with reg,ard to the security of crossed checks has just been printed. It contains three short provisions, wshich will apparenitly meet every requirement of the case, and confer upon the public in the shape of positive law those advantages which, on account of the unanimous feeling as to their convenience, the commercial community have hitherto endeavoured to establish by custom. It providesIv .That a checki crossed with the name of any banker shall be payable to such banker only; 2, Thnat a check crossed "'and Company" shall be payable to no one but a banker; and 3, That a cheek crossedmto more than one banker may be refused payment. These conditions are simply such as the public have always intended to enforce by the respectivemodesof crossingcommonly adopted, and the measure seems likely to receive, as it deserves, the general approval of the banlkng interest. Subjoinedcis the formin whichit hasbeen introduced:- A BILL To A3EI-D TrUE LAW raTnG TO D)RAUGHTS ox B,txrs. "Whereas doubts have arisen as to the obliggationsof bankers with respect to cross-written draughts - and vwhereas it would conduce to the case of commerce, tbe security of property, andtheprevention of crime if holders of draughts on bankers payable to bearer on demand were enabled effectually to direct the payment of the same to be made only to their own or seome other banker: Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's Most Excellent Maiesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Com. moW', in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of thc same, as follows: "1. In every case where a draught on any banker made payable to bearer on demand bears across its face an addition, in written or stamped letters, of the name of any banker, such draught shall be payable only to the banker -whose name is SO added. 2. Where such a draught bears across its face an addition of the words 'and Company,' or any other words, in foll or abbre*ated, by which it may be reasonably understood that it is intended that such draught is to be paid to some banker, such draught shall be payable only to some banker. " 3. Where such a draught bears across its face an addition of the names of two or more bankers, not being partners, so that it may reasonably be doubted to which of such bankers it is intended that such draught is to be paid, the banker on whom such draught is made may, at Ins discretion, refuse payment thereof, notwithstanding that he have in his hands funds of the drawer sufficient to pay the same, And such banker shall not be liable to be siled for any damage incurred by reason of such refusal. " 4. In the construction of this act the word ' banker' shall include any person or persons or corporation, or jointstock or other company, acting as a bankier or bankers. " The subscribers to the Unity Bank have completed the requisite payment of 50 per cent. on its capitl of 300,0001., and it is stated that immediately on the receipt of the charter from the Board of Trade, which is expected in the course of the present month, the bank wi commence operations. ML-. Rebert Reating, L.P., and MIr. James Rhode* have resigned their seats in the direction of the London and County Bank, and Mr. J. W. Burmester has been appointed a trustee in the place of Mr. Rhodes. The weekly reviews from the Amsterdam and Rotterdam produce-markets state tlhat there was little activity in busines, but that prices on the average were well supported. The letters from Rouen mention increased firmness in the market for manufactures, and a greater attendance of buyers. The Royal mail steamer Atrato has sailed for the WVest Indies, -Mexico, and Pacific, with 48,000. - At a meeting of the British Colonial Bank aid Loan - Company the report and accounts, after some discussion, were agreed to. The directors state that, in accordance with'the wish of the shareholders, they hae already adopted the necessary meares for isidiug up the lundertaking, but thlat on account of the operations of the companly in Austialia some period will have to elapse before it can be finally accomplished. The~Blaenavon Iron Company have issued a circular intinating that, as the lease of their property has been renewed on favourable terms, it will be desirable to raise sufficient capital to set the undertakdng free from all its engagements to bankers, mortgagees, and others, in order that it may be developed to the best advantage. A contiibution of 151. per share is *suggested for this purpose on 5 per cent. debentures, at seven years' date. According to the eircular of M. Arles Dufour, of Lyons, the purchases of silk in that market during the past month have been extensive, and the recent rise in prices appears likely to be fully sustained for some time. MIanufacturers, however, are partially restricting their operations in consequence of it. The fo'lowfing, on the shipping business of the port of London during the past month, is from 3fessrs.XV. S. Lindsay and Co., aud furnishes a detail of the system lately adopted by the Govermment iu chartennmg steamvessels for the transport service: b one of considerable depreo. sion, and the amount of busness more than usualy lisrted. Preights have consequently, in most cases, declined, and, though the anrrivls from the southwrd have been moderate, DbrrJ W mapFlo dup?lJ- Qil t si*e te, A=,eubw of -easels on the berth for India and Australia have accumulated rather than decreased. * " A mcderate amount of shipments, consisting of iron and other weight for the various railways, continue to be uaade to Indii at 20s. to 2!s. per ton; but the export of bale and other fine goods is upon a very limited scale, at rates ranging from 15&. to 20s. per ton measurement. Australian freights are somewslatlower, and mlay be quotedatfrom 3s. to 40s., and 45s. The vessels now on the berth are of a large aggregate tonnage (including various very fine American ships, chartered at fixed sums for the full reach of the holds). Tothe West Coast of South Anerica there isagreat scarcity of freighbt. Homewards the operations have been confinedalmostexclusively to gulano, at 90s. per ton. In West India and Brasiian freights there is little doing. Oar trade with the lUnited States, in both exports and imports, continues vary limited, The latter has been affected to a considerable extent by the severity of the weather, which has prevented the produce from being brought down to the peots of shipment ; and this, coupled with the decline of in our grain-narkets, will limit in no ordinary dgree the imports thence this ispring. 'The shipments of iron have been more than usually limiited; but, as afew orders have been received by the last mail, and as many of the American ships have proceed:d hence in balast, our rates are somewhat higher, as will be noticed by our quotatons annexed. " We can hardly form an opinion as to the prospects of the Baltic timber trade. The season is not sufficiently advanced to commence operations, and, as so much depends on the Conferences now pendinig, it is impossible to say at what rate these freights will opl n this spring. A very few cargoes of coals have as yet bfen despatched fortheuse of the ffeet; hut, as the armistice does not prevent our maintaining a bockade of the Russian ports, w e led to suppose that the fleet will again very shogntly roceed to the Ba.ltic, and in that case large supplies of coal's mst be forwarded. It is mentioned in well-informed circles that the money value of the exporits f'rom all parts of Russia for the five years endinsg the 3slt of Decemnber, 1855, has been quite as great as during any similar pe-iod I If this be so that country, in spite ofr our mnost expensive blockade, cannot have sfmfered commercially to the extent generally supposed. In regard to the transport service we may remak that theobsiness transacted by the British Government has of late been on avery limited scale, and the directors of the Transport Board have adopted a system which, while it will give them an enormous command of tonnage at iany moment when required, will also effect 3 considerable savinigto the country. During the w;inter months, when little activity prevailed in the Black Sea in the movement of troops and' manitions of war, and when, consequentlg, there was little ewployment for the transports, aLl those vessels which could be prudently spared were ordered home and discharged. .But- an offer of re-engagement was made to the owners of the most suitable steaniships on the following conditions :-While in port in tlis country, waiting and ready for orders, 15s. per register ton per month, the Transport Board having power to retai them till the Ist of April at thtate, withliberty to discharge them either at that date or on theIst of March, and if discharged, to receive during the time they lay waiting orders 30s. per ton per month; but if despatched upon active employment to receive the fdllowing scale of rates from the date they have orders to proceed Auxiliary screw ships, of any size, 32.s. 6d. to 35s. per 2egisterton permonth. Screwcolliers, suitableforhorses, of from 550 to 650 tons, 35s. per register ton per month. Screw steamers of 700 to 800 tons, and 130 to 150 horse Iower, 35s. per register ton per month. Screw steamers of 1,000 tons and 200 to 250 horse power, 38s. and 40s. -er registerton per month. Very superior steamers, such as those belonging to the Peninsular and Oriental Company the Cunard line, and other similar vessels, of 300 to 40N horse power, 40s. per register ton per month. From all we can learn, every vessel for which these offers were made accepted thconditions, and the Government has now at command a large 'deet of mostS efficient steamvessels ready for immediate service, and ample for almost any requirements. These vessels will either be employed in the carrying of troops or stores to the Baltic or the Black Sea as circumstances may arise, or will be sent to replace those steamships st-illin the service, at 45s. per ton."

STATE OF TRADE. MANCHESTER, 1LuRCH 4. The market has been rather firmer, and in yarns a fair business has been done, but the demand has not been active for cloth. Bnyers for Germany, and also for India, have been taking yarns with moderate freedom, and prices may be quoted id. per ponnd above the rates of last Tuesday. Manufacturers have also been active buyers, and spinners have in some cases demanded id. per pound advance for cops, but the average prices do not reach more than -,d. per pound higher. either on home trade or export yarns. Yarns suited to the Yorkshire as well as the continental trade go off welL There has been a good deal of inquiry for cloth, and prioes are very firm. Messrs. John Slagg and Co. say .- " There has been more animation in the market yesterday and to-day than we have had ;for the last two or three weeks. The accounts from Calcutta and the China markets, received yesterday,are better than were expected, and a considerable business has been done for those quartcrs at an advance on shirtings of folly lAd. per piece on last week's rates. For the home trade aIso there has been an active demand for printers and shirtings, and some kinds of domew ties at gradually hardening prices. Long-cloths and T, clothis, on the other hand, are comparatively neglected, owing to the nfavorable advices from Constantinople and Egypt, but priees are firmly maintained." The prospects of peace have a tendency toinduce caution among the buyers for the levant trade, but there is little donbt felt that this branch of our foreign trade, though it mayfall off comparatively after hostilities have ceased, wil take a more important position than it did before the war. Messrs. Dn Fay and Co. have published an interesting table (one of an annual series), giving an "estimate of the difference in pounds sterling of the sums accruing to the trade in cotton-manufactures during the years from 1846 to 1855, to pa;y for the expenses of fuel, machinery, drugs for dyeig, pnnting, bleaching, interest of capital, and every kind of wages, profitS, &c., after deducting the actual cost of the raw material." Last year's table will farnish an example --They estimate the cotton consumed in Great Britain in the year 1855-at 836,000,OOOlb., and allowing 14 ounces per lb. as the~ waste in s ng,this would produce 744,563,COOlb. of yarn. Vfthis' they calculate that 142,715,aCOlb. has been erported in. the shape of yarn and thread, and 358,578,OOOlb. has been exported in the form of cloth or mnanufactured goods, leaving :343,269,6001b. [as the amount of home consumption. WFe then come to values. The declared value of thread and yarns exported in the yeai is 7,785,900l., and that of mannfactmredgoods 27,025,9001.; while the home consumption, estimated in the same proportion as the declared value of the e2eported goods, plus 1-3, is 24,446,0001.* total, .59,257,gOOl.; from which deducting the total cost of cotton (t36,000,OOOlb:, as above stated, at the average price of a52-3d. per lb.), or 19,739,OOOL sterling, the bdlance left to mncetcost of production, profit, c., is 39,518,800_. It willbe seen from this table that the home consumption of cotton. fabrics last year as equal to 243,269,5001b. weight of yarn or less than one-third of the whole 744,500,0001b., which is a much smaller proportion than has bee retained in previous years. Inl the prossreuos year 1852 the home consum;otSon w as 272,000,OOlb., out of a total of 668,000,OOOlb., and in that year, with a consumption of only 751,000,0001b. wveight of cotton, at 5gd. per lb. (or 16,819,3001. sterling), the total value of our manufactures was 661,500,0001., of which 31,594,000ls worth were retained t home, and the balance towards cost of production, profits, ac., was 44,730,7001., or an excess of 5,211,9001. overthebalance of last year. In the woollen-cloth trade we have to report a steady market. In the coloured cloth-hall this morning a fair amount of business was done, chiefly in mixtures and spring f4brics. In the white cloth-hall only a limited bniness was done, but the general tone of the trade is firm and satisfactory. The report of the Huddersdeld market is as follows -" WeV have had fully an average attendance of buyers. Purchases were, however, more. numerous than extensive. There was a brLsk inquiry-for new spring fancy Xpatterns, and. ready sales were effected in black mixture doeskins and other descriptions of plaid trouserings, at *nedium prices. The wool trade is firmer."

RATIh7A Y INTELLIGENCE. GEAT W:ESTERN AND BRENTFORD The half-yearly meeting of this companysheldfyesterday at Fendall's Hotel, Westminster; Viscount Viliers in the chair. TheTreport, which was rea l by 31r. Eley, the aecretary, stated that, since the general 'neeting in December last, the oDEition of the company had been greatlv improved, as s evinced by the imDortant additions which had been made to the share list. .ic6uraged by their financial position, the directors had lost no time in making the necessary arrangements for commencing the worlks at once; and contractors of the greatest respectability had undert4ken to execute the works within the Parliamentary estimate. The daily increase of the mineral and heavy goods traffic upon the Great Western Railway rendered it of the greatest importance that the works should be completed with as little delay as poEsible, in order to give to the proprietors an early remit. neerative retarn for their capitaL- It appeared from the "construction account' that the total receipts up to the close of lst year amointed to 12i314n., and the tottlexven diture to 5de521.y 1eaving 'a balance of 7,2621, of w ch 6,T50L was in the hands of the AccountantGeneral Viscount Vresin S, in moov'ing the adoption of the report, expressed his satisfactionthat since the last ineethaglsiare after share in the cocern had been ratidly talcen up, bothe by ons loasllyintoe interestedin the dlstnct, and byhosee sho wvere deeply enganed iu commercial pursuits, ho sawI therimportance sfpseah an outlet to the whames for the rapidly-increasing gcods and mineral traffic of the Grewt thesternRailway, as wee afforded by this short line. The directors had nade .a most accuroate examination of the financialposition of the complny,e and the result had been so favortahlethatem eyhid had no hesitation in concltding contracts for the speedy execution of the works upon terms whitli -were, within thbe Parliaieentary estimate. (Hear, hear.) Withregard to the prosperity and success of the undertaking, he thoinEet that rthwas only necessary to look at the daifyiacreasinag traffic of thegreat railway with which they were connected to be convinced of the importance of constructing this lne. The improved- state of the money- -arket would materially assist them in carrying out the works, and he trusted that before fany months elapsed the line wrould be completed. and- the shareholders would begin fto ran that remrunertive return which they werey entitled toloos forward to from so valuable and asefu?l a project. {Cheers.) n lMr. P. Daved, in weconding the motion, ebpressed his conviction that the increasing traffic of the Great Western Rail;ay my must s or become sO importint thathit twold be impossible to carry it on withoet an outlet -to the Thames. It was universally admitted byuengiaeers thlt the cheapest and most advantageous mode of convetnge goods was that -which.was afforded -b a tidal stream. Thellrentford RailwaT, by a short length of four miles, provided an easyt COUmAuniation between the Great Western Railway-and the tidalwpart of the river Thames, at a point to wshtch barges could be brought up avithout any artificial assistance, and frowi hichuthey could convey heavy traffic directly on beoard ship. He looked at the matter entirely ia a conunercial point of view, and he was satisfied that the more the project vas investigated the more apparent its value and importhace would become. (Hear, he ar.) He had no doubt that they would be able to carry out the undertaking with the spint and energy eInch it deserved. In concdusion, tr. Daveylurged theimportanceof construteing the line with as much rapidity as posstble, smice delay wold only tend to dfivert the trafic. Mr. asGem asked when it was probable that another call woufd be madel - The CNorfl said that, according to the act, they could only ca?l21. per share at one time, and that at intervals of three month=.

The half-yearly meeting of this compatny was held on Friday, at the offices, Lombardestreet; Mr. y.Tars in the chair. The CapsrM, ne in oing the adoption of the accovunts, stated that there was ain improvement inthe revene, which he attributed tothe joiont workling of the three companies having lnhes in the eastern counties district. During the last half-year there was an increase in the receipts of 40,000l, a large portiond of which had been carried over the Norfol line. TheFincLease of the gross traffic ofthe year 1855, as compared ieth that of 1854, was about 76,030th The Norfolk Company had advanced 9,000g . to the Wenls and Farenhadth Company; an agreement had been entered into with that company, and there st a bill nowv before Parliament to sanction it. Their arrangement act provided that in 1s60 the thee comIIpanes-viz., the Norfolk, Eastern Union, and Eastern I omtesshottldapply toPa?~rlamoent for a billto amalgamate the four companies, including the bEyast yngtlian If there was any reason for supposing thlat the three porte epon the eastern coast in which the llied copinanies had teronilwas onestoo many, in 1hic it woould be tolerably strong proof that they did not want to be associated with a 'fouth on the same coast. r e therefore hoped they woutld hearno tore of the silting-up of Lowestoft harbour, Mfr. BIDDE}2, the engineer, entered into an elaborate statement, with a view to showv that the Norfolk line was maintained in a most efficient state up to the time it came into the possession of the Eastern Counties Company. The sum of 100l. per mile was paid by the Norfolk Company for the maintenance of the way; but, on the Eastern Counties takiing possession of it, their superintendent said it could beC mavintained for 601. -mile. Seven or eight years having since elapsed, somnething like 300l, a-mile, at 401. per annum, ust have been obtainaed by that moeans, which oungt to have been e perded on the line and s orks, and would accoant forthe state ia 9hich1theyawere a short time ato. 1e concudedby- statincluhatthe graving dock at I'westoft would be completed m the course Of a few weeks.

Every opporttnity was aflorded to the Eastern Counties Compxay to partiecipateinthe o ndertaklig, but for some reason they declied to fall into the views of the promoters. he believed thot if the East Spffolk Company were met; in the spirit in which it oaght to he, that the Eastern Counties and other associated companies would get more by that system from the traflic which the Easti Sffolk would bring than neat they w ould lose by that whEich it would abstract. A long discussion earned in the course of which the accounts were adopted; a resointion was passed than king Sir Morton Peto for his valoable services tlthe compaby, and for thehalf-year, and realecting the retiring directors.

Theworks on someparts of the line were bengcaried on vigorously, but in consequence of the failure of a contractor for the ironwork of the large bridge some delay bad taken place.

CMAMMNG FOR XATIONAL SCHOOLMASTE= doo-~~~~~~~~~~~~ TO THE EDITOR OF THE TMS. Sir,-I wish, if po-sible, to open ld. Lingen's eyes to tbh niecessity for simplifying our aims in regard to the training of national schoolmasters; will you help me to get rid v Blackstone, Eallall, and the binomial theorem from their prescribed course of study? The late minutes for the Committee of Council on Education, 185554 pp. 49-52, contain the following, amoeg other qnestions, set at our training schools -_ "-Who were the Popes during the first quarter of tbo 16th century? Give some acoount of their history. Name the great commercial state of that age, snd state who were Its greatest merchants, writers, and artists o* "What-were the objects of the statates of provsieors andl 'of prcmunnire I 'What great departmentof law does Blackstonestatetobe of Anglo-Saxonparentage?

"There are two points, A and B, situated de north and south, 21 feet from one another; and there is a third ypoin, C, half way between them. Supposing Z to be exceeciivyamall as compared with the radius of the earth, determine how much less a distance A is carried round in an hour by the rotation of the earth than C, and how much greater B._ Apply the resulting formula to explain Foucaults pendulum experiment." Is it wonderful that, after suach training for our schoolmasters, Her Majesty's inspectors should bear the following testimonies - "From some observation I am inclined to think that; many of the certified teachers of the present day,-mesi. perhaps more than women,-several of those especially of gr attaimnents, are not good trainers or managers of their sechools."-Rev.]?.

"IRBOKERS' RENTS." TO THEEDITOP OF THE TD1S. Sir,-An advertisement appeared in the Daily Vic7ss ef Priday last, containing L list of " brokers who refuse to py their rents" (such rent beingi payment to the corporation ofthe city of London), and iwho were consequently "discharged from the office of broker within this city ani liberties." My name occurs in that list through an error of the corporation, as they officialy announce by an advertisement in to-day's Daily News. The list is again pub. lished in 2Te. l1imc, of this morning, and still contnins my name 'without such contradiction- and, though I had been struck out of the list, that circumstance would in moc degree have affected my right to carry on the business of a broker, yet I am desirous of explaining the circumstances that have led to my name pearing in the matter. I was sworn a broker inJuly, I848, and entered into -t4 usual bonds for "honest and good behaviour," in thS penalty myself of 1,0001. and two sureties of a501. each ; also in the penalty of 501. for due payment to the corpor.- tion of 51 per annum, constituting the "1rent" in question. With the principle of the two finrst bonds I do not finc famlt, but the payment of o2. per annum to the Court of Aldermen is made for no assigned object, and is of no advantage either to the public or the brokers. I paid it up to 1863 inclusive, but, in 1854, after the publication of the~ ParliamentarySCo 0bysioners' report relative to the co - ration, I discontinued the payment, and expressed my wfihX to the collector tha the corporation shoult sue me on t3.b bond for w0a, and try their rihet. ZLdtters thus remained until about a fortnight h:ack, when~ Ithe collectorninformed me that if I did not pay the twof sums of 1.-in-arrear by Tuesdzy last, the 26th ist., "n name woud be struck off the saorn brokere ' liset As x I knew this cour3e would involve some explanatory pahliu-.- tionh I sent the money onthe 2ath, and received tte oof tl;l receipts on the morning of the 26th, but by some error ny name waas, nud stil is, included. I feel confident that a very Iittle exertion on the n^Yv cf Wryf eowmmrobend naIw setse Cpeom lf fhis ;Counc!4 tax, which iS not enforced on any who refuse to reugnrsie the corporation. The following are the paragraphs in the reiort. of the commissioners which I have referred to. It is hi3nec It PIr. Labouchere, Sirl Patteson, and thefpresent Cthe'I r of the Exchequern- "WFe recormmend that all lass, acts of Commccs Council or other regulations prohibiting persons not free ef the ti% from carryrng on any trade, retail or otherwise, within tho. city, or from n sng any art, occuneation, ar haudicraft within the city, be repealed and aboluihed. an this reco-L 3nendation the Common Council, by theirrcent resolutions,. concur." And further, more immediately in refer rnce to the nuhject of the payments by brokers, " Statutory enactments likewise exist wbich require tas ' all persons aing as brokers b ithin the city o} Londonh si-b beadmitted by the Court of Aldermen under suhreguali.ons astbeyrnaythinkfit, andsnaXlleachpay aaaunual sumuoi ;L to the corporation.

Their order variedthe decree of the Masterof the 1l7olls, and directed furtffer inquiries to be made and ac-cOto ts taken, and-ordered the further consideration to stand ore r to a future day. 'Lord Justice KNIGHT BRUCE: observed that 40 years and -nore had passed since the originator of the first suit, fr.

Hele, some time in the reign of King George IV., fiIed his bill for recovery of the arrears and for security of the annuity, and that suit became the progenitor of the 11 others, forming an unwvieldy mass of litigation now tnder consideration; that only one other originallitigant than Sir George was still alive, and--the enly, persons in any wray benefited by this enormous litigation w ere the lawyers, whose idle skirmishing had been for a qFuattef' of -a eentury and- more hefore the Court; that the parties presenting these appeals appeared* to ground their case upon the startling, reason that the MIaster of the Rtolls, after such a ruinous litigation, had been too swift;and thseir lordships regretted to saa that they were bouni to prolong it, inasmuch as some of the parties could not beheuand by the former proceedings.

*VICE-CHANCEILOES' COURTS, TuDY, CE 4. COLYEP. V. COLYER. (Before Yice- hance4lor Sir E. T. KLNDEIRs.I This was a legatee's suit, and now came on npon further consideration. The testator in the cause, Wiliam H. Colyer, by his will devised and bequeathed all his real and personal propertyto his three brothers, Thomas, Charles, and Janies, as to James's sh.are to him for life, with remainder to his ehildren, and Charles Colyer and his son Charles Colyer were appointed executors. The bill was filed in 1851, and the plaintiff now asked for interest on the balances found due,and the question was whether, such interest not being'asked by the bill, the Court could give it? Mr. TsxED and Mr. SsmEuwBBc, for the plaintiff, contended that, on further consideration, the Court could give sach interest. Mr. Glasse and Mr. Hallett appeared for the executors - Xr. Baily and Mr. Roche appeared for James Colyer and Eis children. The VICECS-CELLOPR thought that, supposing the balances now differed from those which the execators had originally brought in, it was open to the Court to consider the question of interest; but, as it could not he seen, as the mnatter stood, wrhether that was so, the acCOunts should be dissected, and the case must stand over for that purpose. (Before Yice-Clnellor SirW. P. WOOD.) THE ATTOREZy-Os?mAXi V. yAA. Mr. D-en= and Mr. SPrEE moved, on behalf of the relator in this information, for an injunction to restrain the defendants from completing, or making any addition to the buiidi= begun to be erected by them over a public footay, caYled George-yard, leading from Little Safon-hiUl to HAtton-wall, from digging or excavating any part of the ground, soil, or pavement, or from maling any encroach. 3ntit upon the saidpublicfootway. Mr. B. B. Cabbell, M.P., the owner of the houses on both sides of George-yard, had in lSaS iopped up the entrance of it from Little Saffoahill, on the ground that no public right of way existed through the yard. Tne Paving Commissioners removed the obstruction, and, upon an action of trespass - them by Mr. Cabbell, a verdict was returhed esabliashing that' George-yard was a public footway. Mr. Cabbell had subsequently, attherequest of the commissioners, repaired aortion of the footwaynearthe entraneefrom LittleSaffron-ni. In 1855 the defendants purchased George-yard of Mr. Cablell, for the purpose of building a Roman Catholie cathedral -apen the site, and had puled down a great number of the looses on one side of the yard. In June, 1855, the defendants appled to the commissioners for leave to alter and divert the public footpath, but the commissioners had relused.to comply with the application. In September, 1855, the defendants bad served the commissioners with a notice that George-yard was the exclusive private property of the owners, and that the publio had no right of way through at: They had subsequently commenced excavatine the coil, and buiidig wails which they proposed covereng with minarch, upon which the catfetral was to be bhilt, leaving a naroswpassagebfor the public ander the arch. In conse-qlence of this proceedwg the Beard of Works for the lborn &ILtrict had caued ansinfoeration to be xied, and mowatovedgfor an injunction. Mr. BOLT and u r. hE Yne, for the defendantss coia'tended that the public had no right to anything more than a upoth ofeet-wide, while it was proposedpy the defendants to gly-e them a passage 7 feet wide. - The yard had -formerly eenus as stabling for cabs, and the public had been -obliged to pick theirsway s best th.ey could. Tblhe *V}cE-CSiCELVOR considered that the existence of a footway through George-yard pfrom 1771 ad been clearly -es'cblished supon the evidence. The coymrissioners had, moreover, exercised those rights which were incumbent rnpon them when they andertookz to accept this ortion of thesurface soilso dedicated to thedpubc. A verdicthad also been returned in favour of the persons who were nor -in th posiio of relators. The uabli d right was therefore s-o far clear. Ie was not satisfied, however, that the .ubiio -either required or had used the whole surface, neidst was exitremely probable that a dedication of the '.-hole ground had not tale-n place. It would thereffore be snfficient apon this iterlocutory motion if he ecurcdno -the -pubc that right which had been enjoyed up to thelast two years-viz., a right of passage through the derd,tleaving the largerwriho t csn aimed to be dealt withat Jew.

The order made wrould heio restrain the defendants from erecting, placing, or extending any wall, building, or other obstruchton in, ucon, o o>ver any part of George-yard which shall so encroach upon theedilrd as not to leave a continuous, lunobstrcted footwayiof the width ofseven feetatleast, in the shortest coursedby which the faotwayformerlyenjoyed could he engoyed betteen lHatton-wal1 and Little Saffron-hil, this order to be withoue prejudice to any question as to the estent of herirhtorvasemreItacaimedtby the information- the AtthrneyG-eners to proceed to establish at lw in such mganner a Cle shoNLd thiRk fit the right or easemen so cslaimeS.

SPRIrG ASSIZES. HOME CICI. CHELMSFORD, MARCH 4. CROWN SIDE.-(Before Mr. Baron ALEi5SOx.) This morning having been appointed for the trial of the four men who were charged with the murder of Sir J. Tyrreli's gamekeeper, the court was crowded at aa early hour. The prisoners James Thurgood, 29, William Thurgood, 22, Thonias Thurgood,23 (brothers), andJames Guiver, 30-' all described as labourers, andwho are athletic young menwere chargedupon the coroner's inquisition withthe wilful murder of Williamn Hales. The grand jury, it appeared, had also returned a true billfor murder againsttheprisonerJamesThurgood, but they ignored the bils against the other prioners. Mr. Rodwell and MIr. T. Chambers conducted the prose.. cution; Mr. Pretis defended James Thurgood, and Mr. Woollett was instracted for the others. The learned counsel for the prosecution, in, opening the case to the jury, said&that the inquiry into which they were about to enter was one of the most serious kind. The prisoners were jointly charged with the offence of wilful murder by the verdict of the coroner's jury, but he thought it right to state that, inasmuchas the grandjury had ignored the bil against the three last-named prisoners, he did not propose to offer evidence against them upon the present charge, but should confine the case entirely to the remaining prisoner, JamesThurgood. He then briefy narrated the facts upon which the charge was preferred, and said he was fearful, when theyhad heard the evidence that would be brought forward, and also the testimony of a man who, although not an accomplice in the m3urder, was undoubtedly concerned in the original ilegal operations of the parties, they would feel that their duty left them no alternative but to find the prisoner James Thurgood guilty of the heinous crime with which he was charged. Ebenezer Chalk, the accomplice, was the first witness examined. Heappearedtobeabout20yearsof age. Hesaid, -I am a labourer, and live at Fairstead, near Chelmsford. I know all the prisoners. On the night of the 18th of February we were all at Shedreclds beershop, at Fairstead, and we turned out about 10 o'clock. I then accompanied Guiver to the place where he lodged, and he went in. I waited outside, and in a short time he came out with agms. While we were at the beershop I heard Wiliam Thurgood say that we were to go at night to Sir John Tyrrdl's wood. When Guiver had got his gun we walked down the road and across some fields towards Boreham, where the wood is, and we met all the three Thurgoods in a lane. Each of them had agun. Weallwalkedon'towardsDuke's-wood, whichwas the place we were to go to. I and Guiver did not walk quits so fast as the others, and we fell back, and WiUliam Thurgood, seeing this, called out, "Come on; you seem to hang back there."' Isaid, in reply, "Idon't think Ishall go." James Thurgood then said, " Come on; don't be ritghtened; I shal not be taken this night. by no one; I shall shoot any one before I wiU be taken this night." We then went into the wood, and I heard three shots fired, and two pheasants were kiUed, and they fell into a pond close by. I put one of them into my pocket, and -picked up the second; and Guiver told me to give it to him, and he said it 'was his bird, and he knew what to do with it. I saw Guiver shoot this bird, and when he had done so he loaded his gun again, and we all proceeded further into the wood. I then said that I thought I heard some one coming up the woed to. wards us, and one of the prisoners replied, "Come on; there is no one coming." Iai,a " I shall go now," and ran out of 'the wood. I had no gul When I had got a short distamce I heard a strange voice say, "Come on, mates; here they are." I mas runmag away at this time, and almost immediately after I heara these words there was the report of a gun. I kept on running, and saw nothing more of any of the prisoners till I got home; and after Ihad been there about 10 minutes Guiver and William Thurgood came up, and Guiver asked me if I had seen anything of "Teddyfer," which was a nickname for James Thurgood. I saidIhad nof, and William Thurgood then said, " I dare say he is taken." The prisoners had their guans with them at this time. Cross-Examined.-Ihadbeenout of work a fewdaysonly at the time this affair happened. I had previously been employed by different farmers in the neighbourhood. I was once imprisoned for a month for kicking up a row at a publichouse. I did not know at the beershop that they were going poaching, and I first heard what they intended to go to the wood for after we were turned out of the beershop. I am quite sure James Thurgood did not say, " Tell them not to shoot any one if we are likely to be taken." I ran away frorm the wood as fast as I could, and I heard the last shot fired when I had gone a very short distance. I was charged before the coroner withl having been concerned in the murder, and I saw the solicitor of Sir John Tyrrell afterwards in.the gaol, and I told him I would tell the whole truth, and I told him the story I have told today, and I afterwards repeated it before the magistrates. -osaephWisby, a keeper in the serviceof Sir John Tyrrell, saad,-On the mght of thelSti of February I and my father and the deceased, who were also gamekeepers, were out in Duke's-wood, for the parpose of watching It was a moonlight night, but occasionally cloudy. We all went into a hut in the wood, and while we were there we heard three shotsfiredinthewood. It was ther about half-past 12 o'clock. Upon hearing the discharges of the guns we all proceeded in the direclion of the sound, and as we were passng along the east side we heard the report of another gun in the wood. The deceased went away frommus and went into the wood, and almost immediately afterwards I heard him cry out, " Come on, mates; here they are 1" Upon his saying this I and my father ran into the wood in the' direction of his voice. I wvas in advance of my father, and when I had got a very short distance I beard the deceased sasy "Oh, dear ! and at the same instant I saw the flash of a gun and heard the report, and then there was the sound of some heavy body falling to the ground. The flash of the gun came in a direction straight towards us, and I have no doubt that the gun must have been in a horizontal position at the time it was discharged. I kept on my way into the wood, and a few yards further on I saw the prisoner James Thurgood. He was coming towards me, but the moment he saw me he ran across 'the pond. At this time he had a gun in his hand. I ran after him and stopped him on the other side of the pond, and my father came tip at the same time and tookthe gun avay from hirm, and threw it into the pond. I so e that gun was not loaded at the time. lVhen I laid hold of the pisoner he said, "Don't hurt me; Pve hurt no one." My father said to him, " No; you have only shot that poor man." We then took the Prisoner to Duke's Lodge farm, and as we were going alon I asked him who had shot the man, and he said he did not enow;- there were three or four about him, and he did not know which of them shot him. Myfather said something to the risoner which Idid not hear, and he,in reply,said, "Hefellback like a dead man, certainly.'" The prisoner was searched, and some powder and shot and percussion caps were taken from him. By the Cour.-I saw no other man but the prisoner in the wood, but I heard the sound of several moens footsteps running away.' Exmination continued:-After the prisoner had been searched I and my father and some other persons went back to the wood, and found the deceased lying on his back and quite dead, and his head was lyint, in the direction we had followedhbiL EHis clothes veresmouldering with fine. There' was not the least apTparance of any struggle having taken- plae a th slotwhore be wai lying. Cross-exammed.-I hearcl soven reports of guns altooether The deceased left us when we heard one ieport, and the first thig I hoard him say was, "Come along, mates; here they: are." Directly afterwards 'he exclaimed, "Oh dear,"and: at the same instant another gunwas fired. .James B. Wishy, the 6ther of the Iast witness, corroboatedhiLS testimony." He also'sa;d tatupon his coming up he saw another man in the wood besides the-prisoner James Thrgood, but he could not identify him The nsoner demedhaving shot anyone, and witness toldhimnt9t1he had- and aided athe knewhe was dead.

Copeland, a urg1on .at Chelmsford, said,-I rI - celved information of this occurrince on the morxnin of the'! }9th of February, and Iinmmediately'prodeeded to Boreham, I whec I 'saw the hody'of thO 144W asd.' He was quite dead.' I made a more careful exP,nation oi the body on the same ,vening..-I then abred a a circular wound, aboutttb sizeof. ^ cro Pflpiece, W} she front of the neck, -and a -considerableportion of th0 &'esed'5 clothing, such as his shirt, flanhel WSItSÃ¯Â¿Â½&tCf 'Thd n eck-muffler had been forced into the wound )^Th.shoIIt, and remained there. . The wiound was perfectly :.laight, and the windpipe was completely divided, -and the vertebrae at the hack of the neck wvere slightly fractured: I have no doubt from the character of the injury that the gun must have been presented in a perfectly horizontal position close to the neck of the deceased, and that the-clot> being forced into the wound preventedthe shotlron* completely through the neck. It would have F *asssg sible for the deceased to have uttered a wor" S 1mp1O5 received the injury, 'as the vocal chord' a alter hea destroyed. The immediate cause A 'Were completely ' death was most probably suffocation, but he . not under any cir- cumstances have surnvived th4 Injr mot r tany torthree'minutes. I ectrtdd 65 shots from the neck of the deceased. They 'were not at all scittered, and from the aprearatcees that presented themselves, I have no ,loubtTbhat t m Man 'no shot the deceased mnust have stood quite in *ra't of kin and close to him at the time the gun, waiy alscharged. I believe the -muzzle of the gun could not nave been D7ore than a yard from the deceased. *a ALnnusos (to the witness).-It would not be at' all awl improbable occurrence, I suppose, that a man, seeing himself in such a position, should have exclaimed, " Oh, dea?'S Witness.-I think it is extremely probable that the deceased made use of that expression when he saw the gun presented at him. He certainly could pot have-spoken after he received the injury. Mr. Raisen, a superintendent of the Essex constabulary,. produced the articles thatweretaken fromthe prisoner.James Thurgood. fe also said,-I went to the place where the body was found, and I picked up two pieces of -burnt paper that appeared to have been used as wadding for a gun, and I afterwards cor paed them with the portion of neWspaper that was taken from the prisoner. I found-that all the pieces of paper corresponded with each other, and 'formed a portion of the London JournaZ of the 29th of. September. I also compared the shots that were taken from the body of the deceased 'with thoEc that were found on the prisoner, and they corresponded also exactly with each other. I subsequently took the gun of the prisoner from the aond; wlhere it had been thrown by the witness Wisby, and I found that it had been recently discharged. Itook the prisoners Wiliam Thurgood and Guiver into custody at their lodgings on the morning of the 19th of Febrnary, and examined their guns. They were both loaded, but the shot that was in them was of a totally differint description from that in the body of the deceased. !Mr. James1eech, a gunamith, gave similar evidence with regard to the shot; and he stated positively that the 65shots found in the deceased's body were of the same ldnd as that found in the possession of the prisoner. This closed the case for the prosecution. hMr. PENmTns then made an earnest appeal to the jury on behalf of the Prisoner James Thurgood, and urged that, whiatever suspiion there might bo in the minds of the jurv there was, in point of fact, no positive evidence that would justify them incoming to the conclusioun that it was by the hand of the prisoner that the unhappy deceased had lost his life. He said it was clear there were several others present at the time that the fatal occurrenco took place, an in the scuffle the gun might have*been discharged accidentally or by any one of the other men, and that, at all events, If the case was not clearly made out affinnatively on the part of the prosecution, the prisoner was entitled to an acquittal. The leaTned JiUrGE, in summing up, said that with Iegard to two of the points that had been Euggested by the learned counsel for the prisoner-naniely, with reference to a struggle, and to the wound having been inflicted by accident, it appeared to him that there was not the slightest evidence tat would warrant the jury in coming to either of these conclusions. He then went carefully through the whole case, and said that the only two questions, according to his judgment, the jury had to decide were whether the evidence made oat to their satisfactionthat the prisoner's was the hand that discharged the gun; or, if not, whether he was present aiding and abetting the man who did dischargeit, in either of which ease he would be guilty of murder. If, on the other hand, theywere not satisfied that either of these facts was made out, it would be their duty to say thatthe prisoner was not guilty. ' - , 'The jury retired, and; after a short deliberation, they retuntedtheir verdict, finding the prisoner James Thurgood Guilty of being accessory to the murder, stating at the same time that they were not quite satisdied' with the evidence to show that he had actuaUy discharged the gun, The other three prisoners were Acquiaed. James Thurgood was then called up for judgment, and The leamed JUDoG,'having put on the black cap, said he wouldimake a representation of the oDinion of the jury that his was not the hand that actually caused the death, but in law he was equally guilty of the crime of murder, and he could not hold out to him any hope that the representation he should mjake would be attended .with any effect. His Lordship then proceeded to pass sentence of death in the usual form. 'The prisoner was not inthe least affected b'ythe addr&s of his Lordship, and when he had concluded he exclaimed, in an impudent tone, " Thank you, Sir; God bless yonall 1" The other three men were then placed at the bar to plead to another indictment chargig them with night poaching. They all'pleaded "Guilty." His ILORSIIIPu having observed that they bad had a very narrow escape onthe present occasion, and he hoped they would take warning by it, sentenced them each to four years' penal servitude. The approver Chalk, who was also included in the same charge, was likewise' placed at the bar; but, no evidence being offered against him, the jury returned a verdict of -Not Gsduiy, and he was ordered to be discharged from custody.

The jury gave the plaintiff an additional 151. The civil business being thus disposed of, Mr. JUstice CRESSWELL proceeded to assist in the trig. of prisoners. CPMNAL COURT.-(Before Mr. Justtce B BRVWnn.) The calender contains a list of 39 prisoners, charged with offences of the usual description, with the exception of a boy about 12 years of age, who is charged with the wilful murder df a child aged 4 years. It being ascertained that the prisoner had no counsel, Mr. Baron Bramwell requested Mtr. Skinner to undertake his defence.

Mr. Cripps appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Skinner defnethprsoner. stated the facts of the case, called.the following witnesses:- Sasannah Barnes said,-I am 16 years of age, and live at Hsmgerford. On the 2d of October last I was in Mr. Burd7sfield a little after 2 o'clock. -That field adjoins the Downs, in which is a pit. The field is higher than the pit. I saw a body in the pit. I called George Reason and Sarah Huntley, and went back with them to the pit. When I saw the body thlere was nobody else about. George Reason said,-At 2 o'clock in the afternoon of the 7d of October I was called by the last witness, and I found a child dead in the pit. It was lying on its aide, with its head resting on its ars. Its head and face were covered with blood.- I saw several cut on the head It was not quite stiff and cold.

IL Barker, said,-I am a surgoon at Hun; erford. On the 4th of October I examined the body of Silas Rosier. The body generaly was healthy. I found two slight bruises on theshoulder. Therewerethreewoundsunderthe eye and two on the right temple, one of which had penetrated the brain. There were six places in which the skull was broken. It was broken in several pieces. There was a fracture from ear to ear.- A billhook would have produced the wounds I saw. - Cross-examiined.-The wound on the temple would have c aused death. There were several other wounds, each of which might have produced death. - Re-examined.-Therewas a slight woundacrossthe fingers of one hand. William Rosier said,-I am a labourer at Hungerford. The deceased was my grandchild. On the 2d of October last hs was four years'and four months of age. I last saw him alive at 8 o'clockin the morning. He had a pinafore and black band and a cap on.

I am between 11 and 12 years of sge; About half-past S on the 2d of October I was in the Back- lane at Hnngerford. I saw the prisoner there at a stile which leads on to the Downs. Little Silas Rosier was with him. They were getting over the stile. I heard-the risoner say to the deceased " Yoa can't get over the stile." edeceased said "Yes, I can, I have got over several times.'" The prisoner had a cord inhis hands. They had hold of hands before they got over the stile. The deceased had a pinafore on. - Cross-ex.-amined.-When they got over the stile they went side by side, but they had not hold of hands. They Were going up on the Downs. Re-easnined.-The stileisamain way from thepits. By the JuiTGE.-:I saw -them-go-over both stiles on to the Dow-us.

It appeared by the evidenme of Comniander John Seccombe that the prisoner was sent ashore on the day in question (when the shiEp was lying in the Downs) to takle the chief engineer's expense-bock to that officer, who was then sick in Deal Naval Hos1dtsl, Commander Scecombe strictly enjoining him to use despatch and returnto the Cressy the same day, as hE was thLe only engineer they had to depend upon in the event of weighing, or the engines being started. The prisoner did not go nearhis chief, butleft the books at'apublichousoein Deal (theNew Inn), and made offforDovertovisit his brbther with whom he took a trip to France in the Quean 'mail packet, of-which his brother is the engineer; from Calais the prisoner was on his way to London to finish hi s '1 spree," when he wras apprehended about 40 niiles f-om Dealand sent asadeserter to the 'dagskip Waterloo, at Sheerness, ''hencehewas forwarded to the Cressy,to be dealtwith s theLords of the Admiralty might direet. The prisoner hadnothingto say in defence, but put in certficates of good character from the mercantile firms where he learnt his craft, and he called on Commander Seccombe to speak as to his knowledge of his conduct during the three months he had beenonboardthe Cressy; thistestimony was very favourable to him. The Court, after a very long deliberationj pronounced the charge proved, except in that pait'relative tothe prisoner's apprehension on the road, on the 18th of February, which they had no direct evidence 'to prove; and he was sentenced to be mulcted of all pay and allowances due to him, to be reduced to the grade of a third classassistant engineer, and to be disqualified for promnotion to & higher grade for the term of one year.

REGISTARS MARRAGE& j TO TBE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. , Sir,-Your able article of the 27th ult., on secret marriages at the superintendent registrars office, exposes a most fearful grievance. There are, however, yetfurther hardshipsarisingfrom the new marriage law 'whichpress ,most cruelly onxtheclergy. The-duty is very properly imposed upon us by law of as'certaining the age of persons who come to be marned; if minors, whether the consent of parents has been obtained, &c.; and, under the ordinary system of banns, we are entitled to a week's notice, in order to make such inquiriesbut by the new marriage law a parishioner may bring me a license or a certificate of banns, obtained in an almost clandestine manner from the registrar's-office and require me forthwith to marry him to a erson who may have been residing 100 miles away, so that I have no power of making any inquiries whatever. Yet I am liable to heavy penalties should the yersons be minors or within the prohibited degrees. This is grievance the frst. Another hardship is this. Mfany of those who resort to the surintendent registrar are either mrnors or persons who e that methodof escaping the opposition of parents. Afterward&, whenpassionhas cooled, they feel that somethingis wanting to their respecfabflity. Relatives insist that the sanctions of religion shal be added to tha civil rite. Yet if I join these people together in holy matrimony I am guilty of felony. Two most respectable clergymen are at this moment awaiting their trial for having thus re-married a couple who had bcen united before by the registrar. Surely, in the name of justice, we olught to be relieved from the necessity of accepting the registrar's certificate, which was, or ought to have been intended solely for the relief of Dissenters-not for the ebarrasent of Churchmen. A : o, also, ought to be put to such Aisfm proe secutios asL Ihave alluded to above. lithe cnme of those gentlemen be, indeed, felony, woe to any poor Roman Catholic priest who, as-is common in the case of -mixed marriages, may bless in his own form those who have been joined before by the Pr6testant rector ! If, Si4 you wM use ur powerful pen to obtain for us redress of these harsp, you will earn the gratitude of many besides, Sir,.-: I Your obedient servant : A PARISH PRIEST.

The return is satisfactory, as tested by~ expe.- ience; for it is less by 221 than the averago number oF deaths (corrected for increase of population) in the 10 coÃ¯Â¿Â½responding weeks of the years 1846-55. Phthisis, as is usually the case, produced a grEater num* ber of deaths than any other disease, and was ie.tal in, 1364 case Bronchitis was fatal in the next degree, and 'caried. off95 persons; pneumonzia numbered 62, of -whom two. thirds were intants not more than two years old. Hoopingo cough prevailed to some extent, and 60 children died Of it. This complaint is returned in five cases in there0ort for St John, Paddington; and with reference to"a. child who died (the second in the same famRily rithm a fortnight from hooping- cough) at 14 Wharf South, the medical attendant mentions "the cold and damp atmosphere"isa which'ithad.lived, the cottage being low, anI contiguous. to the Grand Junction Canal.

SURREY THEATRE. The memory of the first French Revolutio lwill nasuredl neverypass away so long as3fessrs. Shepherd and (eich'f establishment, on the " other side of the water," continues to attract ful andiences. The last time we noiiced the Surey Theatre the terrors appertaining to adrama entitled Smadozcs of Crime were revolving round the fire of Jean Marat, as the historical focus of a very dubiouslyBhitrionical system, andthisworkwas immediatelypreceded byanequAUy stormy representation of the republic, called Pat* in 1792. In fact, the supernumeraries of the house maust have grown so accustomcd to tri-coloured scarfs and cockades as scarcely to feel comfortable with any other form of ornanient, and there is no doubt that in the ordinary intercourse of life they feel naturally impelled to shout for the fall of Girondins and aristocrats, as if the human voice bhr its very naturehaa .tendencyto forn itself into Jacobinimprecations. The lastmemento of the old Republicaa days is in thab shape of a revived melodrama, called the &ziior of France. The nautical hero, whose vocation forms the title to thepiece, is the son of an ex-noble, and therefore, in spite of' the good service he renders to his country, a perpetual object of suspicion to the ragged multitude of Brest, who, proud of their accustomed deconation, follow the lead of an, a~deut Saascuiou, acted by Mr. WViddicombe-ons of those: darling poltroons (wve mean, of course, the Saneculotte, t iceb), wrho, bytheir valour in the midst ofÃ¯Â¿Â½ safety, and their pusillanimity when damger draws near,. shal;e the sides of a Transpontine public in a mannersha twould annihilate the audiences of this side of the Thames,. But the sailor, who is represented by Mr. Shepherd, and is therefore the beaus ideoal of reckless bravery,- is such a host'in hifikelf that all France is as nothing -when it opposes-his will. He assistshis father, the ex-noble, to escpe, and is therefore not only a suspected person, but an absolute criniiuna The mob attempts to seize him, but his single arnd is lonsufficient to keep it at a respectful- distance; and when theEameiiob,renewsits efforts tobetter purpose, and attemrpts. tob'anghuxntoalamp,his neck-atonce evadesthe n wse, andhe leaps into the sea. It might seem an awkvard circumstance that the house into which he clambers, aftera log swim, is the residence of the President of a Public, Safety Conimittee.' Nothing of the k-ind! He finds treasonable correspondence on the President's table, and reigns like a despot over the terrified demagogue, whom he holds in his4 power, and wvho is at last gladenough to purchase his silence. by granting him a free pardon, and allowinz him to. marry a very pretty young lady whom be (the President) loves himnself. This young lady, who is a prominents personageinthe story, having afatherandabetrothef tolove, and a persecutor to bate, is plaLyed by Miss Mary Seyton, a. debutantc from the provinces, with a most attractive stagefigure, and a thorough command of all those airs and grace& that make np the artless beauty of melodrama. When, afterthe fashion prescribed by the refrain of Queen liortense, "la plus belie" is united to'"le plus vaillant," the tale heas reached its happy condlusion~
