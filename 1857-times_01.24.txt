Friday Evenjng.
In consequence of the news from China the English funds opened this morning at a decline of an eighth, but the market was afterwards steady throughout the day. The only quotation of Consols for money was 93# to J. For the account there were at one time buyers at 93u, but ultimately there were sellers at that price. Money m the StockExchange was in good supply on Government securities at from 5 to 5i per cent., and in the discount-market the demand was comparatively moderate. Bank Stock left off at 216 to 217j ; Reduced, 93 to 94; New Three per Cents., 94* to J; India Stek, 219 to 221; Exchequer-bonds, 987i to 99. ; and India-bonds and Exchequer-bills, 2s. diseount to 2s. premium.
Foreign securities exhibited heaviness, and prices in some cases were rather lower towards the close. Operations in Turkish Six per Cents. for the account took place at 95, and in the Pour per Cents. Guaranteed at 103a. The general businmess comprised-Brazilian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., new, 97 ; Chi3ian Six per Cents., 1034; Guatemala, 60; Mexican, for account, 21a ; Peruvian Three per Cents., for the account, 55; Russian Five per Cents., 108; the Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 96k; Spanish Three per Cents., for account, 40 and 40k; the New Deferred, for account, 231 ; Belgian Fourand-a-Half per Cents., 97; and Dutch Two-anda-Half per Cents., 647 and .
In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates upon Holland and Hamburg were rather higher. 'With regard to other places there was no perceptible alteration.
The corn-market this morning was again very heavy, and sales could not have been effected, except at a further decline.
The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a steady business at firm prices.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 68f. 5c. for money and 68f. lOc. for the end of the month, showing a fractional improvement.
The Bank of Antwerp, whose charge for advances on foreign bills has lately been 6 per cent., have today reduced their rate to 5 per cent.
The advices from China excited great interest and caused a further advance in the tea-market, a large business having been transacted both in London and Liverpool. The arrival of the telegraphic despatches by this mail was not expected before the end of the month, and the fact of their being transmitted from Hongkong in 38 days is altogether unprecedented. Up to this time they wait confirmation, none of the India and China houses being yet in receipt of any private messages, but no doubt is entertained of their general accuracy. The last letters mentioned that the French Folly Fort was about to be attacked just as the mail was leaving, and that it was supposed when this was taken the fleet would temporarily suspend operations. The inference now is that the Chinese were encouragedcby the suspension of hostilities to believe that nothing more could be effected against them, and that they might destroy the foreign factories and banks with impunity. Happily all these establishments had becn evacuated at the commencement of the quarrel, and the only loss, therefore, will be that of the buildings. The treasure, books, and everything of value belonging to the banks are safe at Hongkong.
In the colonial produce-markets during the week there has been in some cases an improved demand at advanced quotations. The public sales of sugar have been upon a rather diminished scale, and, as the trade evinced a more general inclination to increase their stocks, the auctions on Tuesday went off at an advance of 6d. per cwt., while to-day rather higher rates were again established. The decline of last week is therefore fully recovered, the quotations for most descriptions being now as high as at the conunencement of the year. Floating cargoes of foreign have realized extreme prices, the sales being chiefly confined to Havannah. Coffee continues Iinn, and with small supplies; plantation sorts of Ceylon are is. per ewt. higher, while full rates have also been paid for native growth. For the sales to be held in March next the Dutch Trading Company have advertised 443,000 bags, against 393,000 bags at the corresponding period of 185G. The quarterly sales of cinnamon declared for Monday next consist of 3,250 bales Ceylon, against I ,720bales in the October series. The large quantities of rice brought to public sale rather tended to cause depression, but the principal portion found buyers at only a slight reduction from former terms. Saltpetre has again been quiet, and quotations may still be considered nominal, the middling qualities offering at much lower rates without findig buyers. Business to sonic extent has oeen done for arrival at 38s. A large quantity of nitrate of soda has been disposed of at 18s. to 18s. Gd., and two cargoes at 18s. to 18s. 3d. The tea-market has been much influenced by the telegraphic message to-day. Several thousand chests of common congou changed hands at from is. Id. to is. Id. per lb., closing sellers at Is. ld. for a small quantity. Moniing anid Kaisou teas were much inquiredafor during the week, but holders decline selling unless at extreme rates. Scented teas have been taken freely at a considerable advance.
The following relates to the position of the shareholders of the Royal British Bank -
" Sir,-With reference to a paragra in the 'city article' of Thc Times of this moaning, in wvrich you referto the ruinous litigation now goin on in the affairs of this bank, and in which it is stated that the executions against individual shareholders are for the most part at the instance of persons who have bought up debts at a low price, will you permit us, as the principal buyers of these debts, to state that in no instance has any debt purchased by us been made the cause of any action or proceeding against a shareholder orany other person ; but, on the contrary, they have been purchased by the friends of shareholders with a view to extricate them from their present very perilous circuemstances?
* We would also beg to suggest that some great fallacy seemnsto prevail in almost everything that is published touching the affairs of this bank. For instance, the ruinous litigation now carrying on against individuals may be instantlv stayed by the appointment of a receiver. Why not, theu, appoint one? Is it because the interests of one or two individuals are opposed to it, and, if so, ought such a state of things to exist a single day? Again, we are told that great exertions are making to coUect a fund to settle with the creditors-with what probable chance ofsuccessyourreaders nay Judge from the followior facts:-
*The creditors exceed 4,000 in number, and the shareholders who have to pay their claims are about 280. Of these about one-third dispute their liability, another third are unable to pay anything, and the remaining third will certainly be exhausted by this ruinous recourse to their individual liability, unless it can be instantly stopped by the appointment of a receiver.
" The shareholders were told that bankruptey afforded facilities and protection unknown to the Court of Chancery, and threatened that the floodgates of litigation should be opened upon them if they resisted its jurisdiction. What has been the result? A state of things which the Lord Justice Knight Bruce declares to be a national disgrace, and which, unless a receiver be appointed, bids fair to realize for all persons the fate of the unfortunate countryman who invoked the genii to turn the Ganges through his stables in order to cleanse them, and was himself swept away in the torrent he had invoked.
*We remain, Sir, your obedient servants,

It is stated that, owing to the activity of the home demand, only a small portion of the silk recently arrivedwill be likelyto gotothe continent.
The telegraphic advices regarding the Brazil Royal mail steamer Tamar, w-hich has put into Vigo with daaaged machinery, state that the requisite material for the repair of her rudder cannot be obtained at that place. The company are therefore making arrangements to send it out by the Peninsular steamer which in to leave Southampton on the 27th. The interruption occasioned by the accident -will throw the vessel nearly three weeks out of her tirne.
The aunexed relates to the liquidation of the affairs of Messrs. Dickson and Co., of Glasgow, who failed three years back for 325,0001. It appears that the funds in course of collection under the estate would, if divided, yield only 1lid. in the pound. There are six actions pending, in which the firm are interested to the amount of 9,8791.:-
" Sir,-My attention has been drawn to a letter in the 'money arhtle ' of The Tisa of yesterday, and I think it my duty to take notice of it at onee, as it contains statemeats which are inaccurate, and also reflecting unjustly upon the administration of my estate. It is quite tmre that no dividend has yet been made, but the sole reason of delay bas been the pendency ot heavy and serious litigation.
t" The position of Dr. M'Ewau in Glsgow is an am,ple guarantee that no undue delay would be suffered to exist. With regard to the accounts I may mention that, according to the Scotch law, they are audited every three months by the commissioner upon the estate, and the sederant book, containing a full Account of the proceedings and state of funds, is constantly at the office of the trustee, accessible to any creditor whatever, and at any time.

From foreign ports we have received 9.938 querters of wheat, 10,656 quarters of Indian corn, and 9.190 barrels, of flous- and from Canada MI quarters of wheat. The enrtpst in thae sanse'time comprise 1,760 quaeters of wbeat, 1.747 quarters Of oats, 6 742 quarters.of Indian corn, and 386 reeksand 1,318 barels of dotxr. The trade continues dull and depressed. and it would appear that our prioes are too high to allow of our competing moeuesully withL tthe country markets. Indian corn has been in fair request, and prices are inclined to etiffen. The weather baa been stormy. but mild.

The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on ThlursdaY at Middlesborough, M1r. RI. Pease in the chair.
The directors presented a statement of accounts, which showed that the half-year's disbursements had been 2,7301., covered by a receipt of rent from the Stockton and Darlinton Company. Such expenditure of capital as had taken place in the same period had been obiefly required for windmng-up some outstanding accounts, further completing the purchase of land for the Roseberry branch, and providistg additional accomModation for the ironstone traffic. The directors being of opinion that advantage wonld arise from some more permanert arrangement being made with the Stockton and Darlington Company, by which a fixecl dividend should ba guaranteed in perpetutity, had placed themselves in communication with that conipany, and hoped to
sumt propo'sitions which could be recommended for ac-
The report was adopted.
Iessrs. HI Pease and David Baker were re-elected direc-
tors, and br. Macnay auditor; and a 5 per cent, dividend guaranteed by the lessee was declared.
The meeting was then made special to consider a proposi
tion for leasing or selling the line to the Stockton and Darhington Company on that company guaranteeing a 6 per cent, dividend in perpetuity from the 1st inst.* that the captalto earsuc dvidnd e 9,001 and that the authorized loan of 20,000.lee be apitalzed 'by the issue of

Mr. TREVOR objected to a decision being como to until the shareholders had been made aware of the receipts from

WILsoN (a director) explained that under the terms proposed they would get 6 per cent. one year earlier; that the creation of neow shares (worth from 51. to 61. preminm) would he equal to aa additional Isa. per annum on every 251. shate for the next 10 years; that the trafflic of the line would of course be largely afrected by the state of the irontrde; and that at the end of the lease now running they would have to provide rolling stock at a coat of 30,0001.
Mr. MAc.ayy added that the cost of working the line wras very great, some of the gradients being as heavy as one m 40, and that this item of expenditare could not be reduced, even though the opening of the North Yorkshire and Clevelanad line should by comipetition bring down the rates.

The market has been a shade firmer in consequence of tho
harder tone of the Liverpool cottou.market. lUp to this mornng there vas a great anxiety to sell among spinners not unier order, and the circle of sellers was increasmg, but to-day they are leSS willis to make the concessions required, though still bye are able operate rather cheaper thau they were eight or ton days ago.

and for t hese goods buyers find a diicu]ty2b supplying tefr orders ithin the limits o£ their correspondents.

LONDON, SATURDAY, JANUARY 24, 1857.
Those who rail at the press an& publicity may be satisfied to the full by a contemplation of the continent. There the freedom against which they inveigh has ceased to exist. No presumptuous hand dares to draw aside fhe veil behind which the great affairs of State are transacted. Even the actual events of the day are dimnly or distortedly perceived by entire populations. Matters of the highest importance have been in debate during the last six months, but it is not too much to say that a real knowledge of the subjects diseussed has been confined to the English people. To neighbouring capitals the telegraph brings nothing but the price of stocks, the movernents of Royal personages, aind the smalltalk of diplomacy. For the frequenters of foreign caf5s the newspapers have little more than the commonplace occurrences of the day -accidents and offences, fires and inundationswith perhaps a literary article on the musical instruments of antiquity, and a political article on the perfidy of England, and the danger with wlich her institutions menace mankind. The press is " invited" to support any cause wiuch the Government affects, and" invited" to refrain from publishing the answers which may appear in England. Matters notorious on this side of the Channel and the German Ocean have never been even remotely alluded to on the Continent. Domestic events happening within a few miles of the capital remain unknown to the great body of the people if calculated to excite agitation or even disagreeable commnent. It wrould seem that the darkness is settling every day deeper and denser. A year ago there was hardly the same total suppression of long and important series of facts which wte find at present. It seems as if the index had gone back centuries on the dial of time. We have steam and electricity and extended education, but we have also a scientific and systematized apparatus of cordons, and passports, aud bureaux of censorship, which has, advanced to perfection with equal step, and the consequence is that whole nations are more cut off from a trtue knowledge of what is passing in the world than in the days when pedlars hawked about the tracts of the Reformers, or village politicians sneered against bishops and farmers-general. The docility wili which the system is accepted is surprising enoughli to any one who loocs back to the conivulsionis of eight years since. Still, as it is accepted, we have no right to interfere; and are bournd to confiie ourselves merely to observing the plheniomenon for our own instruction. When some instance more extraordinary than usual appears, it is worth noting as a proof how far the highest civilization, in the conventional use of the term, may be united to a political condition which moves our astonishment and pity.
The Prussians are a people for whom a high intellectual rank has always been claihned. They have been distinguished in Germany for the attainments which make Germans eminent over tlhe rest of the world. Their men of letters, their professors, their critics have been deep-thinking, and many-sided, and everything else on which a German values, himself. The KING affects philosophy and literature and art, and we are always hearing of his cordial reception of this musician or his congratulatory visit to that sculptor. Patriotic aspirations, iesthetic tendencies, are indispensable to a reputation at the Court of Berlin. The KRYG at one time is intent on wresting a province from a neighbour-so earnest are his impulses for the greatness of Germany. At another time he desires to establish a German Empire on the ruins of Austria, which he thinks no longer capable of her highh mission. Thuls it may be seen that he is in intention nofainnLt monarch, and, if he patronizes traislationls of S8olpwdles, set to modern music, it is only as the fitting pastime of a learned sovereign. iNow, let us consider the political and social condition of this people, occupying a great place in I the world's estimation, educated up to the highe3t
pitch of philosophical refinement, and whom we are apt to iniagine discussing the Analysis of the
Infinite as we talk of a hoGrerace or the news from Canton.
We are informed, and can well believe the fact, that Berlin is still in almost entire ignorance of all that has pasted on the Swiss question. The Prnssian papers have either given orny the Royal view, accompanied lwith invectives on Switzerland and democracy generally, or they have preserved a discontented silence. Even the anti-Prussian opinions expressed in other parts of Germany have not been allowed to penetrate to the well-guarded nnderstandinga of the KIno's lieges. Our Berlin correspondent writes,-'" The officials of the Prus"sian telegraph station at Frankfort had "orders to transmit no Swiss intelligence "of an exciting nature, and the Swiss papers "that contained anything of the sort were "either withheld by the police or by the proprie"tors of places of public resort." In fact, this question, -which the KiNG declared to be eminrently one of honour and reputation, was strictly forbidden to be discussed by any class of his subjects. Considering that the Germans have never been wanting in the kind of patriotism which bursts into a Baine at a touch, and that the question of Neuchbtel is not more insignificant than many another about which they have gone wild, it would seem that the KIN:G might have safely allowed his people a little liberty. That the facts of the case have been steadfastly excluded from Prussian ears shows nerely how thoroughly the policy of repression and isolation has been adopted in a country where it was hoped the seeds of liberty had taken root and were about to grow up and flourish. It is only from such declarations as that of Baron VOx MAziTEIYPFEL that the people are allowed to learn the position of affairs. The
Minister-President tells the House of Deputies that " the subjects of the KING detained in prison "in Neuclvlel have been unconditionally set at "liberty, and that it will therefore be possible "now to settle the future position of NeuchAtel at "a European Congress." This is certainly a gentle way of breaking the intelligence that the Royal pride has received a galling check from the finnness and courage of the Swiss people and the public opinion of scandalized Europe.
But the habit of prohibiting free discussion, or even the mention of unpalatable facts, has now become so general on the continent, that we can only see in this Prussian affair the working of a system deliberately adopted by the absolute monarchies of these latter days. What success it will have time must show. We in this country are, of course, likely to imagine that such a theory of government must soon be dissipated by the outbreak of the governed. But, if experience is to be of any use, we ought, as a people, to abdicate the character of prophets. Revolutions have come when we were felicitating monarchs, and despotisms have been restored when we were just beginning to have some confidence in republics. With regard to the state of Europe at the present moment, it is as well to be cautious in prediction. It is gloomy to us, but the people have become accustomed to darkness, and, like the inhabitants of the frozen zone, see nothing cheerless in a semi-night. The situation may last for years, and the present time may give but faint indications of that which is to come ; but it cannot be doubted that repression is being carried to its furthest limit. The political atmosphere is felt to be stifling. The educated classes, recovering from their fear of Socialism and violence, are asking whether this is to be the future of Europe. Those who ask the question must supply the answer. It is the part of England to abstain from interference, and we shall with difficulty be induced again to meddle in conflicts in which we are likely to gain nothing but the ill-will of both the embittered parties.
After all we have written against wanton aggres-
After all we have written against waaton aggressioxn and unnecessary wars, and after the brief respite we have enjoyed from tidings of blood and fire, it will not be supposed that we can hear with much satisfaction that hostilities have been recommenced between the Europeans and the Chinese, that the Factories have been attacked and partially destroyed, that a nephew of the Governor of Hongkong has lost his life in the confusion that followed, and that it had been found no longer possible to spare the city of Canton. Whatever the extent of the mischief, the results, or the responsibility, these are deplorable events. Alany innocent persons will suffer the worst evils of war, and a wide current of injurious consequences will spread over nations and ages to come. Nor is the calamity the less because it may happen to be unavoidable. We deeply regret this untoward occurrence, and all the more because at the same moment we find ourselves engaged in a war at the other end of that continent. But we must say that, on the evidence before Us, taking men as they are, and considering the inevitable consequences of the vicious system in which the Europeans have weakly acquiesced, we do not see how this rupture with China could have been helped or long deferred. We have only to imagine the case of a barbarian Power so jealous of its European visitors, with whom, nevertheless, it carried onl a large commerce, as to insist on their always communicating blindfolded, or only in the night, and then without lights, or by means of certain stuapid and corrupt interpreters, or under some other absurd and awkward condition. There would inevitably be misunderstandings which it would be impossible to set right, and, as it woiild really be impossible either to find out in each trifc who had made the first slip, or to repair it when made, the tesponsibility would rest on the side that had insisted on the intercourse being carried on upon so dangerous a footing. In this particular case it would appear that there were mistakes on both sides. They were mistakes naturally incident to the state of things required by the Chinese. That state of things was itself a cor'inual insult-insuIlting in its nature, arising out of a desire to insult us, and productive of new insult&-on the part of the population. In the first step in this affair the Chinese authorities believed they were insulting us, and delighted in the idea. They had been emboldened to the act by our long submission, and they rejoiced in the opportun;ty of showing their own people how high a tone they could take with the ou 'er barbarians. Through their own arrogance the negotiations were carried on in a way that must come to nothing, and, as they have chosen to play the game of the wolf and the lamb with all the ferocity and none of the strength required for the aggressive part, they must take the consequences.
The real fanlt on our side,-and it is a fault, a most unaccountable fault,-is that we have submitted for so many years to a systematic violation of the treaty so dearly won by the former war. By that treaty we were to have free access to certain ports, and, though the Chinese maight reasonably insist on any police regulations or any rLstrictions necessary for the peace and safety of the empire, they required much more, and they were perfectly aware that they requiired much more, than the treaty, to any common understanding, allowed them to do. The treaty was to give us a freedom of intercourse for commercial purposes which we had not before enjoyed, and the Chinese hlve obstinately refused to give I us at Canton any more intercourse than we had before enjoyed. They tried the same policy, if so it may be called, at the northern ports, and were beaten by the superior firmness of the British ropresetatives. At Canton either our difficultiea
were greater or the Chinese authorities preamned more on their own strength ana the ready sympathy of a fanatical population, and the result was unfortunately different. We have not gained a step there. We have suffered uniform exclusion, and, every now and then, insult and outrage. As a correspondent reminds us, it is only ten years since four Englshmen, taking a mouthful of fresh air in the neighbourhood of Canton, were surrounded and literally worried to death by a brutal crowd. More recently a French missionary has been seized, tortured, and, contrary to treaty, put to death, simply for being found at large. A few years ago scarce a mail arrived without the news of some insult, and if there has been less of it lately it is simply because we have gradually yielded ground, and acquiesced in the extravagant pretensions of the Chinese authorities. Jndeed, for a long period the British Consul at Canton has not been allowed the least commiunication with thema. It appears that this 'very affair of the " Arrow " is not the first, or the second, of the sort that has occurred, and that it is not long since the Chinese seized a lorcha with our colonial register, took down the colours, dismantled it of its sails and rigging, and refused to give up the hull till the latter was rescued by the boats of our rmen-of-war, when the Chinese would give no compensation to the owners. Indeed, it is evident that they have resolved to set at nought the colonial orJinance under which ve have re,gistered native-built vessels, even though they had ample notice of the ordinance, had not a Wnrd to say against it, and could not deny it to be according to the treaty. Lo doubt they found that in the constant passage to and fro of a vessel which could not at once be distinguished from those in their own hands, and vwlich of course, too, was manned by natives: they had a new difficulty in keeping up the bar of excommunication between themselves and the foreigner. But, the more reason they had for disliking an honest execution of the treaty, the more were they bound to prepare themselves to carry it out.
Should the rupture go on to its natural consequences, to the ultimate submission of the Chinese, to large concessions on their part, and to a final surrender of their ridiculous exclusiveness, it is some comfort to know that all this cannot do harm, and wil probably do good, in the present state of China. The last time these questions 'were discussed, China, of which we knew little indeed, was regarded as a marvel of domestic policy and administration. It was believed to be as remarkable for its internal peace, unity, subordination of classes, good government, content, and all the material parts of a political Utopia, as for its exclusion of foreigners, and philanthropists were found to justify the latter on the ground of the formier. On what pretence could we demand to force oLir way into an empire which clearly had so little to gain from us, and in wlhich we could have no place but as learners? Had they not a perfect right to maintain regulations so justified by the resiilt, even though that result might not in aU respects accord with European tastes and opinions ? These expressions no longer apply to an empire wlhich for seven years has been ravaged by two ruthless factions, tearing one another to pieces and perpetrating massacres beyond the most horrible precedents of history. They do not apply to the city of Canton, or to its humane and enlightened Governor, who during his reign has butchered in cold blood 70,000 persons in the shambles of his city on the ground of their being in the interest of the rebels. Philanthropists, even in their most experimental mioods, do not now beseech us to spare this fair region the contaminationa of European manners. Indeed, as our faith has itself been horribly travestied by one of these factions, and as many of the massacres are perpetrated either for or against a supposed sympathy with our religion, it certainly is to be wished that we should have an opportunity of speaking for ourselves. At all events, matters cannot possibly be worse through the admission of Europeans, and now we conceive is the time for demanding that common right of mankind. To the best of our belief our exclusion is maintained, not from gronnds of policy, not from national feeling or prejudice, but from some very small and mercenary considerations. We are shut out of Canton, and the population of the city are instigated to assist in our exclusion simply, or at least mainly, to prevent a freedom of trade. Once admitted into Canton to trade with whom we please, there is an end, not indeed of the export duties on Chinese produce, but of aU the little perquisites and prof Ls made by the local authorities, from the Commissioner downwares. In fact, exclsion is only another name for corrantion, which is easy enough so long as no European can enter Canton, and every pound of tea passes through the hands of the Chief Commissioner. But once we are in, as the spirit of the treaty allows us, there is an end of all underhand gains, much as the trade itself, the two countries, and the whole populzsion of China, would gain by the loss.
In spite of philosophy and in spite of religion
In spite of philosophy and in spite of religion there are ceitain forms of poverty-even unblameable poverty-to which a sort of disgrace a'taches. UIndoubtedly it is often idleness and vice that bring the poor into the workhouse, but even apart from this we cannot help seeing something lowering in a workhouse. It is perhaps a necessary evil attaching to public and legal, as distinguished from private and voluntary, charity. Voluntary charity forms a bord of communion between the giver and the receiver, wlhich often raises and dignifies the poor while it relieves them, but legal charity has no personal communion as its basis; the giver and the xeceiver of it are both abstractions; the giver is the nation, and the receiver is a class. Thus, in our imaginary scale of institutions wJ involuntarily rank the workhouse next to the gaol; the juxtaposition is not defensible, but, however we may struggle -gainst the connexion, we cannot altogether undo it. Moreorer, we cs-inot afford to do so. we must not, in justice to ourselves, and in justice to the poor too, raise the workhouse altogether out of these lowering associations. It is good for the poor themselves that they should be reluctant to take advantage of such a maintenance, and that they should connect a certain inferiority wvith it.
And, if this is true of ibe adult population of a workhouse, it is still more true of the workhouse children. We cannot pass those long strings of boys and girls, in their gray workhouse dresses, without a feeling of compassion for the involuntary, and we hope unconscious, degradation which marks their entrance into life. K,ot that they do not appear well fcd and well taken care of, but their look is that of the children of 'the Union. We know that they are an exceptional race, outcasts from the great system of nature and the first institution of Providence,-the family and the home,exiles from the sacred parental influence, and from the genial associations of place and neighbourhood. It is impossible to look upon a class brought up under adverse and cheerless auspices btut as, in a certain sense, a degraded class. We klnow that their workhouse training miust be mnore or less a stigma upon them in the society of their equals, sticking to them, perhaps, a long time after they have left the union walls, for the poor are just as much alive to differences in the social scale among themselves as the rich are. The worlkouse boy must doubtless prepare to be twitted afterwards with his workhouse breeding by the sons of the labouring atistocracy, whose gentility was
never tainted by that servitude. Nor is the xtigma the worst relic of the workhouse education. It is not good for any one to be brought up under an impersonal parent. The education which is gained under such circumstances is a necessarily defective one, wanting in freedom and manliness, and in natural appeals to the heart and affections. Fear and the sense of subjection are very poor substitutes for filial obedience. There must be more or less prostration of mind under such a system, and the submission paid to the master and mistress of a workhouse munst be a very external and hard performance, compensated for often by secret rebellions of the will, and tending to create more or less of a habit of dissimulation and disguise. The same system whichl cows them and. deprives their tempers of free play and expression fosters latent disaffection and disgust. When such a class as this leaves the walls of )egal nutrture and legal training to come out into the world they feel themselves a lower class, and they start in life with the consciousness of a taint ; and to be conscious of a stigma is, in too many instances, the very way to deserve and earn it. A man who feels himself looked down upon lowers his own standard of honour and propriety, and squares his own conduct with what is expected of him and with the estimation in which others hold him; and thus a sort of Helot class is produced which cormpensates for contempt by disaffection, and meets the reproachi of society by low and often criminal acts.
Thle last return from the Poor Law Board gives 51,550 children of botlh sexes as inmates of the workbouses of England and Wales, of which number nearly 6,000 are described as " capable of " enterig upon service." With respeet to the total number of children in workhouses, that, of couirse, cannot be reduced except by such causes as reduce disttess and poverty in general among the poor, and therefore 'we muxst leave that to take its chance, and vary, as it must do, with the alternations of comniercial prosperity ancd distress. But surely somethiing mlore miglht be done for these children than is done when they arrive at the age to work -sonmething more might be done for these G,000 children that are described as capable of entering upon service. It is indeed a shanie to see the number of fine ablebodied young men and women in many of our workhouses, vho, at the cost of their own freedom and happiness, and the cost of an enormous sum to the public, are kept prisoners within walls, wvhen, if encouraged to emigrate, the United States, Canada, and Ausvralia would scramble for their services. What a pitiable waste of that most valuable of all commercial articles-human labour -and what a gratuitous neglect of a natural opportunity for the liberation of an unfortunate and depressed class, and a restoration of it to its natural place in society! Colonization has become within these last few years the natural vent to a large class who used to regard it with horror, but it is a particularly natural relief for a class like that of the young inmates of worklhouses, wlho have already been separated from the ties of fanmily and home, and so have not that trial to go through again, and who would find in the colonies just that new world which they want to obliterate the taint of old servile associations, and enable them to start in life as freemen, without a stain uipon them. Would it not answer our purpose in many cases to supply this class with the funds for emigration, and by one larger outlay at Grst forestall the expenses of years o^ maintenance ? Certainly, if our criminals have had for so long a time the advantage of emigration free of expense, and have in many cases made such a profit out of their trip, it seems only fair that the inmates of our workhouses should be allowed the same opportunity. Your pickpocket or burglar has gone to Botany Bay at the cost of the nation; in a few years he has got his freedom, set up a sLore, or taken a sheep farm, and. from a smalU sh-lf of articles or one or two head of cattle has at last risen to a fortune and respectability. Wby sbould our workhouse inmates ba worse off than our criminals, and. why should we object to do as a mode of provision what we have done sJ) long in the form of a judicial punishment?

Sacred Harmonic Society.
SACRED HAAMfONI( SOCIETY.
The programme last night was one of the most interesting ever offered to the public, and the performanee one of the lnost adntirable. Mendelssohn's music to Racine's sacred dranta of Athitie was gwen for the first tire since 182, and Rossini's Steabat. 3acr, after many years of hesitation, to which the hearty reception encountered by Mozart's snagUihcent Jteqecem at length happily put an end, was now first attempted by the members of the Sacred HieronOic Society. The success an as complete, and thus oe more attractive concert bill is insured to the repertory-e monelinz fact to all real lovers of music in England.
lt is scarcely possible to over-estimate the pleasure derived from an attentive hearing of two workg so widely opposed to each other that they would scrcely seem to be manifestations of one and the same art. But the men differed as remarkably as their compositions. Both endowed vith extraordinary gifts, the one died fu: his art, while the other lived to regard it with indiffereA. That Mendelssohn's feverish and excitable temperamesit led him to overtax his physical means, and, by the enormous amount and variety of labour he simultaneously undertook, to husten his end, there can be no more doubt than that Ilossini-who left off composing just as Mendelssohn, in his overture to A Aisumincr Nighet'8 Dream, hbad shown the world that a new musical genius had arisenmore wisely, perhaps, deternined to increase his chances of longevity by indulging for the futuro in the detce far saienec. At 38 Rossini had written Guilaitmc l'cl, and cost aside his pen; at 38 Mfendelssohn bad produced Etijak, and was eagerly engaged upon a third oratorio (Cl t-ite), an opera (Lordcey), and other things of less importance, when death overtook him. His whole thoughts were occupied with theseworks, of which, although he had formedthe plans in his tnind, the outlinesand a few fragments alone are left to help us to gue.,s what they might have been had Provi. dence allowed hinm to coisnuit them wholly to paper. Rossini, still living, at the age of d5, is not very likely to betake himself again to an Art whic4 he has onow obstinately neglected for nearly 30 years.
To draw any comparison between the music ofAutalicand that of the Sfabat .fater would be absurd. Ther have notbing in common. It is erough to feel that, while the first exhibits a far profounder conception and in all respects is of a mnore elaborate and lofty character, each is beautiful in its way. We doubt, indeed, if any of the ancient Italian settings of the Franclscan hnnn could stand a chance of appreciation by the side of Rossini's, which, for luxuriant beauty of melody, is remarkable even amnong the writings of one undoubtedly the most prolific of all the ItaIan melodists. Happily it is not our diuty to describe either AtIhmc or its companion, since they are too well known to need description. A few general remarks on the execution wll suffice. The "illustrative verses" of 1Ir. 3artholousew, vhich connect the imitations of the lyrics in Racine's drama, to which Mlendelssohn's music is adaptedl in theEnglish version (the wliole forming a poetic narrative of the scriptural story of Athaliah and Joas), were recited by Mr. Phelps, the comedian, whose sonorous voice and clear enunciation admirably suited him forthe task. The principal solo singers-Madame Novello, Miss Sherrington, and Miss Dolbgy-merit unqualified praise for the pains they took, and the impression they created was unanimous. We have arely heard the duet "Ever blessed child, rejoice !" or the trio "Hearts feel that love thee" (both with chorus)-wv.hich for tranquil beauty may be ranked with "I waited for the Lord," in the Lo riesang-more beautifully sung than by these ladies. T'he last was encored and repeated, and during the entire evening thts was the only occasion on which Mr. Costa aeceded to such unreasonable demands. In the SWiat Mater the soloists were itadamne Novello, Miss Dolby, Mr. Sims Reeves, and Signor Belletti, who, throughout the performance, in their respective solos, as in the ssorceaux d'e,acsn td displayed a vocal talent and an artistic feeling which called for nothing less than unqualified commendation. Singng mnore nearly allied to perfection it would be hopeless to expect. Rossini himself would have been just as satisfied vwith it as was evidently Mr. Costa, who never conducted a performance with greaterzeal or with more triumphantsuccess. The chorus-except once or twice in Atl/alic (by much the most difficult task they had to perforu), and especially in the scene which divides Joad's annun;ciation of the New Jeruamn from the grand muarch of the Levitepriests-were always, to use a homely pkrase, " up to the mark " and their singing in both compositions did them infinite credit. The fugued finalc to that of Rossini-on the word " Amen" -will, however, go ttiU better when it has become more familiar; but almost aU the rest was irreproachable. In sk-ort, it is only strict justice to say that on sno pievions occasion have we listened to so fine an execution of the Stabat aMter. The band, if for nothing else than its superb reading of the march in Atlalie, would have b,een entitled to the warmest eology; but in every other respect it supported its high reputation. Repeated hbrsts of applause testified to the delight of the audience. This was anotber concert to be remembered with gratification by the Sacred Harmonic Society, which appears just row to be making lapreeedented exertions. Although the free tickets, to whioh subscribing members have a claim on every occasion of a first perforrmance, were withheld last night, the hall was crowded to suffocation. It may be proper here to state that complaints have been made by certain members about the habit of 4epriving them of this privilege, which, according to a letter signed " An Old Member," and addressod to DVse Time, is indnlged in too frequently. But we also gather from our correspondent that there is a special reason for it-viz.. to enable directors "to ineet the expenses of the socie.y." We had always understood that the Sacred Harmonic Sciety was a body of amateurs practising the works of the great oratorio cou,posers, not for the sake of gain, but for the love of art; and thatherein lay their highest distinction. if, then, we have been wel informed, we cannoS see the hardship of which "An Old Member" complains. It is surely better to give up tre.ating their fnends to a concert likely to prove remunerative, and so to furnish the society with the sinews of war, than to be called npon to pay so much each out of pocket-more particularly since we learn that the advantages of which they are deprived at one performance are restored to them. at the next. StiJl less are we able to discover what our correspondent tsnea
when he says that (in conseqvence of such sacrifices) " the public are indebted to te yencn7aity of snbscribing members of the society," and should " know their obligation" to those gentlemen, "wbose gratuitous performances and subscriptions thus become a cbaritable contribution to their (the public's) amusement." 10s. ld., 5s., and 3s. are re%nectively charged for adasson to the performances. Where, then, is the obliqation under which the public is pretumed to laboUr ' go far as we can coniprobend the constitution of the society, the meshers (all amateurs) pay a small annual stipend for the right of singing and playing at all the private rehearsals and pAblic perforwances; and if that annual stipend is, as we have heard, only a guinea, it mnst be confessed that they purchase their amuserment and instruction very cbeaply. Their livelihood is not gained by the exertion of their nausical talents. as in the case of professional artists but by means generally believed to be more lucrative, We are unable, therefore, to sympathize with the complrint of ,An Old llember," which, under the circiumstances, is anything but founded on reason.
The State Of Newgate.
THE STATE OF ZVEWG4TE.
TO THE lDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I perceive that my letter on " Newgate Past ard Present" has drawn forth a communication from M\r. Alderman Rose. So far as the intimationx given, that new arrangements were contemnplated, it would appear that there whs some prospect of amendmnent, but I would beg to remind hMr. Alderman 1hose that in 1836snore than 20 years ago-the inspectors of prisons proposed and published plans for the reconstruction of Newgate (First Rcport of Inspedors of Homr District, page 100), w,ith a view of preventing that demoralizing contamiiination which had been permitted to exist for so lengthened a period, and with such evil consequences both to the imprisoned and to society; but these plaus were ixtterly disregarded, And e wgate remains in 18N7 much the same as it wss in 1I.W3
Mr. Alderman Rose refers with just satisfaction to the new prison at HollowaY, and which was intended, I have been given to understand, to supersede in a great degree the necessity cif having Newgate as an established prison of detention, with the capacity for enlargement of the prison at Holloway for the untried.
By such arrangement law courts iight be contme,ted in the present area of Newgate, with rsitable lockups for the primoners awaiting their trial at the sessiont (for which a daily spply could be furnidshled). y such an arrangement it has been estiiated that about 4,OOUI. per annniu could be saved, and "the den of devilry" beawzpt Wwa. lNew sessions and other courtb might be erected which woald be creditable to the city and a great public convenience instead of the present state of timings, which is considered so disgraceful to the city aisthorities.
The cost of altering Newgate, it may be assumed, will not be much les thian 50,Q0f. - and will it be satisfactorY 'when it is thus altered? t
It 'would appear that the state of things is at this moment just at s point when the city authorite sDar y make most subitasmti&l and satisfactorYY arangeenJ8ts, that would be highly creditable to themselves, asuwould be hailed with 8atisfuction by the public.

The Chinese Question.
TRE CHINRSE Q-UESTION.
(FMO0,M A MR - - \
T2he intelligence brought fromn China by the lart mail, a summary of which appeared in your inpressioa of Yesterday, is not materially different, perha3ps, from 'what might have been anticipated as khe natural progress of events; but it tends more -forcibly to show the gravity of the situation. Yeh, 'backed up by the gentry and populace, tutored !os-s their childhood, and fromn father to son for ,several generations, to hate and despise the foreigner, and hug themselves in the conceit of their own immaeasurable superiority over all the civilized States of Europe, and their right to treat as outside 'barbarians the subjects of those States, and leap every kind of indignity and contumely upon them, is now, with a retributive juLstice, bringing upon the heads of the authorities and governors of China war and trouble-the bitter but inevitable fruit of the tree so long and sedulously nurtured with pride and ill-will. Recent -events have excited public interest to a remarkable -degree, and, considering how little attention is habitually paid to anything that may happen in a country so distant from the scene of our great -diplomatic and political struggles, I can only see in it a subject of congratulation. But in proportion as the public interest is strong it becomes impor taut that it should be rightly directed and not misplaced. Many of youir contemporaaies appear more bent on making political capital of the initerest which has -been so unusually excited, and converting it into -an engine of attack upon the G(overmnent in the approaching Parliamentary canmpaign. I am not surprised, therefore, that the views you laid *befp your readers when the news first reached ui:Ye of the rupture of friendly relations at Canton have supplied the test for mluch vituperation, and -that you are denounced as tnanifesting a total disregard of international morality or the principles of justice in the estimate you were led to form as to the true merits of the questions at issue.
The grounds of attack, selected by your contemporaries with varying degrees of preference, may be -very briefly summed up under three heads-namely, the original ground of quarrel, the international Law of the loreha question, and, lastly, the meants taken to obtain redress, assurming that a grievance existed. In this order let me once more pass in review the leading facts, not in the spirit of legal hairsplitting, but on the broader basis of common sense and its practical application to the preceding circumstances of our relations with China and its authorities as the actual condition of -things in the China seas, It wvill bardly be disputed -that, in comnmon with alL other Sovereign States, we are justified iu defending the rights and immanities attached to our flag in the Qhina waters as .elsewhere. Nor can it be seriously questioned that -the best interests of trade and our national character are alike involved in our capability aud readiness, at all times and under all circumstances, to cause -those rights and privileges to be respected by other nations, civilized or barbarous. XNow, there is one fact amid aU the conflicting testimony of the official documents about which I conceive it is quite impossible to entertain the slightest doubt, and that is the fact of the Arrow's having been registered under a coloniial ordinance and emnowered to fly the British flag, that it was known by its English and by no Chinese namne, aud was rightiully or wrongfully believed by both parties at the moment the fracas took place to be under the protection of that flag. Yeh is at especial pains to assert in the beginning, and offers to reiterate, his knowledge of the fact of its registration. He knew, then, by his own admission, we see, that the Arrow had possessed a colonial registry (under an act of the Colonial Government giving all such vessels certain rights and privileges wvith the British flag, which act had been formally comlunicated to hir
by the proper authority many monthls previously, and without protest made or rervonstrence on his part as to the inexpediency or illegality of such act), and in despite of this he had
-deliberately sanctioned an act of his oflicers, acting l under his authority, in violation of the rights and privileges such registry was designed to bestow and place under the guarantee and safeguard of our
-treaties with China. True it is that when he foundi -the time had at last arrived for serious resistance to I -such acts and his systematic disregard of all remonstrance, he endeavoured to shuitle out of the .Procrusteau bed he had made for himself by. alleging his ignorance of the pretensions of the l Arrow to be considered a British vessel, yet in the' same breath, withl the blind inconsistency of a man :so far commiitted in a dangerous course that he loses the faculty of exercising a sane judgment as to the
means of escape, he declares that " the lorcha was I in no respect a foreign vessel" (the registry and flag to the contrary notwithstanding), and insists when this latter fact was recalled to his memory'
" that no mistake was committed." What does this! final assertion amount to? In plain words, that he -denies, and persists in denyinu, all power on the part of the British Government or colonial
authorities to give to any vessel in the conditionc of' this lorcha-that is, built and owned by Chinese resi-; -dent in the colony-the rigbts or privileges of a I British vessel. " And rightly so," say some of Yeh's friends in this country, we observe. "Rightly so; by the established principles of international law the British Governmnent can neither assume suchl power as regni-ds the Chinese, nor denationalize a -Chinese subject." And in support of the argument they qtuote the state of the law as recently promul.gated from the Home-offce in respect to the subjects of foreign European States naturalized in Great Britain. Whatever may be the final opinion adopted, it is at least clear, and -wholly irrespective of the legal right on either side, that this and no other was the question on which the Chinese and British authorities were at issue. It was so understood by both, and it is Perfectly idle, therefore, to waste any words upon the minor and entirely secondary poinit -one purely technical-as to the recent expiration *of the period for renewing the registry, because Yeh did not know it in the beginning, nor even at a later period thought it worth referring to or sheltering himnself behind it as a ground of action and justification. On the contrary, he claimed the right to ignore and altogether disregard the privilege* granting power of the colonial ordinance, 3a he had
repeatedly in times precedina done in effect and .deed, turning a deaf ear to all remonstrance. One of your contemporaries says it is not even alleged that this was a second or third oflence of the same kind. If it vill be any satisfaction to the writer I can give the assurance upon unquestionable authority that many similar acts had taken place during the present Viceroy's reign; and that within the last 12 mnonths a lorcha under Brtish colours -was seized and dismantled at Canton, and the hull *only recovered by the boats of one of our men-ofwar after -weeks of idle correspondence, and no redress or satisfaction obtained for the owners. This and no other being the question at issue, I repeat, whether the Viceroy wvas bouiid to respect our flag wYhen bc:stowed under the conditions of a legal ordinance of the Colonial Legislature of Hongkona upon vessels built in China and employed in the coasting trade, in which British interests of some magnitude v-ere involved, and to which he had made no objection when communicated, what part did it become .our representative in China to take in the face of a persistent denial, enforced by acts of violence on the part of the repi-esentative of the Emperor of China (Yeh being the lmiperial Commissioner as well as Viceroy of the two provinces),-
to submit, addressing i-emonistrances, habitually treated with cortempt-or to resist? There are few of that large and intelligent class of Englishmen whose lives are given to the pursuits of commerce, or who have any practical knowledge of trade and the essential conditions to its successful prosecution in the four quarters of the globe-very few, I will venture to aflinin who would be found -willing to acquiesce in the firt of these propositions, however peacefully disposed, knowing, as they mn..st full well, by long experience, that without pro-tection to our flag and respect for the immunities it confers jealously maintained, no healthy or prosperous trade can exist. Resistance was the Sonly alternative left. But the right or necessity of resistance granted, it is still urged there was neither wisdom, justice, nor humanity shown in the mea.res adopted. They constituted, on the contrar., we are told, " a grosz violation of international law ;" and the infliction of the most con-diga punishment on the responsible actors is accordingly invoked. I apprehend that whenever the arbitrament of arms may justly be resorted to, the measures to be adopted by the aramed force on whom the duty falls of exacting redress muiss have relation to the localities and the power to be coerced, and if the latter be itrenched in sullen pride an(d the inaccessibility of a retreat writhin a walled city, ancd the only effective means of attaia-
ing a solution of difficulties threatening the best interests of two empires, or oneeven, be the capture of the city or dislodgiment of the chief authority from his position, it is the legitimate and Tecog
right of the armned force to effect an entrance and dislodge the enemy by such means as are best
adapted, provided there is no wanton destruction of I life or private property, or the employment of means discarded in civilized warfare. Judged by this standard, any loss of life or property that may have resulted is, in one sense, no doubt, to be laimented, but lamented as a stern necessity, and not as a wanton outrage or " revolting crime" for which commanders or nations are to be branded with infamy. The amount and nature of the resistance must often in such circumatances be the measvre of the evil inflicted, and the responsibility should rest on the heads of those who made the resort to force unavoidable or necessary. Nor, under the circumstances, are the populace of Canton, or this particular official, Yeh, very worthy subjects of commiseration or sympathy for the results of an attack so long and perseveringly provoked. No peaceable foreigner has ever stirred out of his penned-up factories at Canton among the former for many generations without being assailed by every opprobrious epithet and the risk of being stoned, happy, if he ventured beyond the immediate precincts, to escape without serious danger to life and limb; nor can the life over which Yeh so patriotically laments be very precious in his sight, who, in eight months of the year 1850 caused 70,000 of his fellow-subjects to be butchered in the Canton shambles on a general charge of rebellion. It is now some 10 years since four unoffending Englishmen were brutallv tortured ancd murdered, not three miles from the factories for no other offEence than attempting to obtain a little fresh air and being foreigners, or, in the popular language, "'white devils and barbarians." -How long was this state of things to be tolerated by all the civilized Powers of Europe-this medheval state of " dog Jew" and Christian, in which the part of the Jew was ours? But very recently a F'rench missionary found in the interior was tortured and murdered by the authorities in violation of tue most solemn engagemlents of treaties which guarantee their lives even when they offend by intrusion. And in all such acts of violence and atrocity the Cantonese have ever been pre-eminent, mutually encouiaging each other, and on each new outrage
further emboldened by immunity. Ijutilt this state I of things is remedied, radically and with a strong
hand, there is no security for life, and no possible I permanence to friendly and mutually beneficisl relations. I say with a strong hand, for all experience in that country has taught this lesson, that only by such means can the Chinese authorities and populace, especially when under the guidance of the former, be made amenable to reason or accessible to arguments based on justice and good faith. Not to go back to periods anterior to the Treaty of Nankin, wvlhich abound in such lessons, how came we to be exempt at the northern ports from such humiliations and outrages as every day brought to foreign authorities and residents in Canton? It is no secret. The attempt to exclude us from the provincial city of Foochow (very similar in rank, situation, and the turbulent character of the population to Canton) was made in the begiining, but, fortunate]y, it was resisted boldly and determinedly by those who were chartged to wratch over our interests; and again at ShaDghai, immediately after the murder at Hwangehukee, near Canton, the same scene was very nearly being repeated, and three missionaries barely escaped with their lives; but there, too, a check was given, not, however, until an embargo was laid on 1,000 Imperial grain junks carrying corn to Pekin, the river blockaded, and a brig of war despatched to Nankin; then only redress was obtained, and the crimninals previously declared to be unseizable were found, publicly identified, and punisbed, aind for years after foreigners were secure alike from insult or injury. But it is useless to multiply instances; the fact and the inference to be drawn from it are too notorions to al -who have any acquaintance with what has taken place in the progress of oar relations with China. No European ower mnay secure or hope for justice and good faith at the hands of the Chinese, save in the degree in which they are known to be prepared, if need be, with an armed force to extort both the one and the other, so far as outward acts are concerned.
When those who have nothing to stake or to lose, then, by the embroilment of affairs in China or the murder of our unoffendiog residents so loudly invoke with a sort of visionary and pseudo-
bilanthropy the strict application of international a as this is understood and received among European States-namely, a law equally obligatory and binding upon all-they simply demand that the foremost Powers of Europe should conform to all the capriecs and tyrannies of Oriental barbarisml, humbly accepting kicks for favours, while they kiss thefootof him who insults. Above all,theyforgettbat the first and fundamental condition of all such oblig'ations of international law is reciprocity, and this in China is wanting. The Chinese do not know, neither will they recognize the obligations of international law, and they only outwardly conform to some of its more important provisiors in so far as they are under compulsion. To insist upon our being constrained, under such exceptional circumstances, to adhere absolutely and always to the letter of international law and usages among European States is to deliver ourselves bound and manacled at the mercy of Eastern officials, who in their dealings with us ac7 nowledge no restraining law, and at once despise and fear us. It is to renounce all friendly or mutually advantageous relations, and relinquish alike the profits of trade and tlhe advance of civiljzation following in the track of commerce. Is this the object sought for, or a thing to be desired ? If not, let us cease to deal with such practical questions and matters of gravest interest in the spirit of bookworms, or men who are wholly unversed in the management of mundane affairs, and look upon thines as they are, if we would apply any efficient remedy to what is evil, or escape the worst consequences of those which may prove beyond our reach.
As regards the original ground of quarrel, then, I am clear, despite the legal or technical flaw as to the registration, of which such capital has been made, that it was a just and necessary qaarrel in its essential features,-one forced upon us by the arrogance and obstinacy of Yeh, an official who had been guilty of an almost uninterrupted series of aggressions and provocations to war since his first accession to office ; and if on the pa-t of China there were in the acts of the Colonial Legi8lature any just cause of complaint afforded, the means were open to him, by remonstrance or protest, under the conditions established by treaties, for their redress. With this conviction I cannot but hold cur representative and the admiral commanding the forces perfectly justified in grounding upon the complications which arose from the original quarrel a demand for the cessation of a state of things incompatible with the maintenance of friendly relations, and at variance alike with the letter and spirit of our treaties, and, when refused, employing al the means at their cowmand to enforce compliance
nor can I doubt that Her Majesty's Governmnent, looking at the whole affair in connexion with the
long-continued and eminently unsavisfactory state of our relations with China in a large and comprehensive spirit, lookinig beyond the present inconvenience and the evils it may entail to a future improved condition, Nill take such measures as may be found recessary to pla-e those relations upon a better basis than they have hitherto been, and with greater security for their permanence,-a result the benefit of which China will largely participate in, though in the blindness of both Governor and people it may be overlooked. And not only China, but all Europe must profit; nor does it seem to me at all doubtful, with the same interests at stake, that both tle French and the Americana will be disposed at once to make cornmon cause with us in exacting the abolition of all offensive conditions of exclusion-offensive in spirit and injurious in their operation, and, above , in enforcing the right of nations to free intercourse and access to the Governorn of the country, as the best security for peace and amity. Finally, it is no slight guarantee of the intolerable nature of the oppressions and injuries suffered under the treaty, and of "be absolute necessity without further delay of seeking and obtaining redress, that the merchanct on the spot, on whom the imnmediate evils fall the heaviest, and with a unanimity for which they are not very remarkable, have declared their adhesion to the policy of the British authorities, and manifested their willingness to bear the heavy share of the burden which unavoidably falls to them as the price of these efforts to place all our relations on a xuos satisfactory footing.

The metropolitan demonstration against the war minepence carme off yesterday-the wettest and dreariest day of the new year, and, as a consequence, the meeting was byno means so well attenied as it rould have been had the weather been less inclement, but as the day advanced the Oak-room, in the Mansion-house, was pretty nearly filled. The Lord Mayor presided. The first resolution was proposed by Alderman Roe, and was to the effect that Parliament be petitioned to reduce the tax by lid., so as to leave it at the same rate as it stood before the war. Mr. Butt seconded the resolution, which was supported by the city members, Alderman Reynolds, and Mr. John Drew Atkis. The latter gentleman declared himself a fundholder and landed proprietor, but stated that he would prefer that the income derivable from those sources should be subjected to the tax rather than that fetters should be placed upon the industry of the country. Mr. Thomas Dixon, a Poor Law guardian and a magistrate of the county of Dublin, moved, as an amendrment, that the tax be wholly abolished on and after the 5th of April next. The amendment being seconded, a rather stormy discussion followed, in the course of which Alderman Reynolds tacked about, and suggested the withdrawal of the original motion. The hon. member for Youghal thought there could not be any objection to an immediate abolition. It was certainly the opinion of the majority of the meeting. Some desultory conversation ensued as to substituting the amendment for the original resolution. Mr. T. Kennedy, M.P., said he came there not to take any active part in the proceedings of the day, but to learn how he should act on his return to Parliament-to understand the opinions entertained as to the total or partial abolition of the income-tax. He was of opinion that a resolution should be adopted for the immediate abolition of the tax. Mr. Butt, as seconder of the original resolution, and in the absence of Alderman Roe, the mover, would take on himself the responsibility of withdrawing it. The Lord Mayor then put the amendment in the form of a substantive resolution, that the incometax he totally abolished from the 5th of April next, wlhich was carried with enthuisiasm.
zeO'sTER HousEs.
An impracticable and almost childish movement has been set on foot in Dublin, with a view of enlisting public sympathy in favour of the small shopkeepers by the withdrawal of all patronage from those monster houses which, by a vast expenditure of capital, have for some years past contrived to monopolize the retail trade of this city. A meeting of the allied traders was held on Tuesday, at which Mr. Grogan, M.P., presided, and at which Mr. Butt, M.P., wasthe leading speaker, in condemnation of the monster system. A Belfast journal (the Nothrn Whig) refers to the proceedings in these terms:-
" The monster establishments of Dablln, it appears, are ruinig the little shops, and the little shopkeepers are very angry, and the congenial Reynolds declaims on the grievance from the petty counter. Conceive grave men, decently dressed, denouncing the application of large capital to shopkeeping! Mr. John Reynolds is rather proud that he voted for the abolition of the corn laws, -when in Parliament, _n 1846; and he does not now propose any legislative measure against plate-glass windows, and circun lar galleries, and corps of rneat-handed youDg men. But what incomplete freetraders he and his class in Dublin really are is indicated in this ludicrous movement. The impotency of the movement is apparent on the face of it ; and in our sense of the misguided mischievousness of the proceeding all sympathy with worthy men, not vise enough to endure quietly the inevitable changes iin trade, is utterly lost. Mr. Isaac Butt wa.s once Professor of Political Economy, but on this occasion he rested his main argument on a couplet from the more picturesque than scientific Dcecr-td ViWage and the whole question is put ina the pathetical way. We are very sorry that the small shops cannot compete with the big shops, but we question whether the struggle among the little shops themnselves was less fierce than the contest now is between the one 'monster emporium' and the class 'small shop.' Xad we are sure that if the monsters beat the pigmies, it is not because, as Mr. Reynolds imagines, cheap things are put in the windows to attract purchasers to the dear things in deadly reserve.tside; but because, on the whole, the public, which never long patronizes the inferior, finds itself best served by the monster. Things are relative; the monster of to-day may be alittle ahop in 1900, and the vanquished and overtaken, in the whole of this 19th century process of the conglomeration of capital, must find what consolation they can in the general benefit to which they individually are sacrificed. Wherryboats and smacks bad to give way to steamers and chppers, the coach and car to the railway tra-n, the handloom to the spinning-jenny; and so the world progresses-doubtless over many a corpse and amid muuch convulaion. To the Dublin traders we cannot venture to give any further advice than this-if they wish either to consult their own self-respect or toobtain the serviceable ^ommiseration of the public, they will dispense alike with the leer and the whine of Mr. John Reynolds."

TO TaE EDITOR OF THE TrMEs.
Sir,-Your correspondent "A Barrister' thinks that I should state publicly the names of the parties concerned in the case of "Legal Accident" which you were so good as to insert in The Times of Monday; and, as many private correspondents who have evinced the deepest sympathy in the case have expressed their belief that such a course would be more satisfactory to the public, even while enclosing contributions from themselves, I think there should be no longer any feelings of delicacy about the matter, and I therefore comply vith "A Barrister's" request as far as I can at this [moment. Mr. T- was the late John Matson Temple. For upwards of 12 years he was in the employment of Messrs. Coster and Co., Aldermanbury, during the last three vears as their buyer. He had left this employment, and also that of Messrs. Bradbuxy and Greatrex, with a character for spotless integrity, and was on his vay to Manchester when he was arrested at the Rugby station.
The names of the committing magistrates I cannot at this moment ascertain. The judge who tried the cause at the Coventry Assizes on the 18th of Marcb, 1853, was Baron Parke ; the counsel for the prosecution was Mr. Flood; for the defence Mr. O'Brien. The name of the solicitor for the defence I ami unable to give. bfr. Temple, the brother of the deceased, who took upon himself the entire management of the case is not now resident in London, and poor Mrs. Temple herself, owing to the fact of her having been confined when the trial took place, cannot give me any information upon those I points.
I I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

The Property And Income Tax.
I THE PROPiRTY AND INCOME TAX.
OFFICtAL STATEMT OF THE CHANCELLOR
OF THE EXCROTTR1R
I Yesterday, at 1 oeclock, some 40 gentlemen, representing
the Property nd Income Tax Association, recently embodied in the metropolis, with Major Reed, M.P., at their had, had an interview by appointment with Sir George CorneWAll Lewis, t0e Chancellor of the Exchequer, at his oflicial residence in Downing-street, to urge on him the immedtAte cesstion of the part of the Property and Income Ta- imposed for the purposes of the war, and for a more equitable adjustment of the remaining portion as it bears on incomes derived from trades and professions. The deputation included among others Air. Deputy Barnard, Air. Jacob Bell, Mr. J. A. Nicnolsy, Mr. G. W. Elt, Mr. H. Potter, Mr. T. Lovick, Mr. G. Walter, and three representatives from Huddersfeld, Reading, and Ipswich. They assembled first at the King's Arms Hotel, in Old Palace-yard, and htving arranged their course of procedare there repaired in a body' to D)owtning-street.
Major RxinD, InLP, introduced the deputation to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the subject of their visit, which he said was to call his attention to the nlecessity for ant immediate repeal of the acts of Parlament which increased the income and property tax fromn 7d. to 16d. in the pound, and for a more equitable adjustment of the tax on incomes from trades and professions as distinguished from real property. Hle adverted to the exdterment vhich, he said, prevailed throughout the country generaly at the possibility of continuing the war part of the tax beyond the 5th of April next, and to the general understanding there was on the part of the Houase of Commons and the people out of doors, when the tax was increased, that that portion of it ahould cease on the actual term'ination of
lte, The treaty of peace wvas concluded and signed on the 30th of March last, but aot ratified until the 27th of the following month. The deaptation were wiling to adrmit that the Chancellorof the ex..che xer was at libertyanda had a right, on astrict construction o7thephraseology in the act of Parliament, to continue the additional impost until the 5th of April, 180, but he believed the country generally entertained the opinion that by the spirit of the act it ought to cease on the 5th of April next. He made a passing allusion to the meetings which had been recently held in some parts ofthe provinces, and especially to that at Exeter-
a11 on Wednesday night, in which that opinion had been strongly and unmistakeably expressed; and he sought, by the way, to deny the charge that hLd been made in some quarters, that the latter was a packed meeting, or that a considerable number of the audience were ladies. He then read the resolutions passed at the Exeter-hall meeting, the principal of which-a previous oue having expressed the opinion of the meeting that the additions made to the tax for war purposes should cease from the 5th of April next-was,
{ That the Dresent system of levsing the income-tax by taexing errmaienit and Dreesrlous Incomes alike Is nmsafesily unjust. ad leadA ttoa general nd systematic evasIon - that the despotic and lnqtsitonal mode of assessment is rupugna,tt to the feeUngs of Englishmen, and bas only been euhmitted to from time to time under the Impression that the tax wasfor a temporary purpote- and that the meeting pledges itself to swe every legititiate ineana to ootaiu a more equitable adjustment of the tax and an in,prevemnentlIn the mode of awesement. or a total repeaL oft upon trades and prOfe nist"sm
It would be for the Government to attach what weight they pieased to those resolutions, but he might add that similar resolutions had been passed throughout the country generally, and that there was an universal determination on the part of the people no longer to submit to a war tax after the 5th of April next. (Hear, hear) He would humbly submit to him (the Chancellor of the Exchequer) that the country fully relied on the integrity of the Government and himself to keep faith with them on this matter, sad to relieve them from the additional impost from and after that day. He was proceeding to advert to the subject of the loans contracted during the war, and to the mode of treating them, when
The CltNCBLLoR of the ExCH1QUER said, that only affected the question so far as it increased the interest on the national debt. Loans in Consols never became payable within so short a time. They muerely increased the annual interest of the permanent debt.
lajor RsED, resuming, adverted to the statement made recently at a public dinner by Lord Panmure, that the Estimates would be less this year by 20,000,0001. than they were during the last, and contended that that was an additional reason why the obnoxious part of the tax should be removed. He assured the ChanceUor that no member of the deputation was actuated in coming before him by any feeling of animosity to the Government or to any member of it. (Hear, hear.) They cane there merely from a sense of justice to the country to endeavour to hold him to his bargain, and to urge onx him to forbear taking advantage of the quibblo in an act of Parliament, for that was the expression used to indicate the popular feeIing. If he (the Chancellor) could consistently with a sense of public duty state that he would surrender forthwith the extra 9d. in the tax imposed for the purposes of the war, he (Major Reed) felt assured the announcement would convey much satisfaction to the country and allay a great source of irritation. (Hear, hear.)
Deputy BARNARD expressed his entire concurrence in the statement made by 31aor Reed, and added that the feeling appeared to be unanimous in the Court of Commou Colncil in favour of the discontinuance of the additional 9d. from the 5th of April next, on Thursday last, when a notice of motion to drasr up petitions to Parliament to that effect from the Comaon Council was given by one of its members, to be discussedat the next Court. He for himself could not see anything to prevent the Chancellor acting handsomely in this matter; on the contrary, it would tend to give him greater standing in the country; and, as the representative in some sort of the Court of Common Council on this occasion, he (Deputy Barnard) would only further say that they woald be very angry with him (the Chancellor) if he did not from the close of the present financial year remit the obnoxious 9d. (A laugh.)
MIr. NICVIOLAY briefly testified to the general feelin- in Marylebonein favour of an immediate remission of that p art of the tax, and to the preparations now making there or holding a large public meeting on the subject, which wvould probably result in a deputation. with Sir Benjamin Ball, a member of the Government, at its head, asking permission to have an interview with hbn (the Chancellor of the Exchequer). He called upon the Chancellor to do with a good grace that which otherwise he would be assuredly urged to do by tbhs pressure frorn ithout.
klr. SHAW, the high constable of Huddersfield, spoke to the strong feeling on the part of the inhabitants of that town in favour of the repeal of the 9d., as evinced recently at a large public meeting there.
Mr. GowL'o, from Ipswich, cited the instance of the Sardinian loan, in which the Government had expressly declined to take advantage of a similar wording of the aCt of Parliament to that contained in the statute imposing the war part of the tax.
After a few words from Mr. JACOn BxrL,
Major RxED explained to the Chancellor tnat the deputation -would have been much larger but for the circumstan ce that many of the provincial deputies who attended the meeting at Exeter-hall had been obliged to return home before the day fixed for the intelview.
The C AN;CELLOR of the EXCExQUxpt-I Will only say that when Major Reed wrote to me requesting me to fix a time for the reception of the deputation, both Thursday and Friday were mentioned, and, as I had no reason to suppose that one of thoss days would be more convenient than another, I said I should have great pleasure in fixing to-day, and it is now very satisfactory to me to state to you personally that I have not the least reluctance to give you such information as is in my power with respect to a question on which I am sure both youslves and the country generally feel the deepest interest. (Hear, hear.) I will also remark that the question has been brought be-
fore me in the opening statements in very temperate and I proper language, and that I have no doubt from the means of information which we all possess the statements you have made on the subject represent the feeling very generally prevailing throughout the country. I must, I am afraid, begin by saying, in order to give a full answer to all the qnestions you have brought under my notice that it would be necessary for me to enter into a full explanation of the state of the expenditure and revenue of the country, and, in fact, to anticipate the annual financial statement which it wiUl be my duty to make to Parliament-and to Parliament alone. I could not, consistently with my public duty, anticipate the nature of that statement. (Hear, hear.) I think, gentlemen, you must all be sensible that it would not be desirable for me to take any other course than the one I have just indicated. (Hear, hear.) But I will nevertheless offer such remarks as are in my power to give an answer to the statements you have made. The observations you have set forth turn on two questions-the first is upon the nature of the tax itself, and the other is upon its present amount. I will take the objections to the nature of the tax first. These objections go to the very being and nature of the tax itself. You say it is inquisitorial and makes no distinction between permanent and precarous incomes. Well, these objections, which have always been made, I repeat, go to the very essence of the tax, and they would apply as much to Sd. in the pound as to 16d. or to any other number of pence. I don't see, therefore, on the presentoccasionthat any advantage would
be gained by going at length into the nature of these objectionls. I am qtuite aw-are of their existence. I do not myself believe-and I have stated so elsewshere -in reference to the proposed differential duty, that as between permanbentt and precXr incomes the di'diculties which would
bec * Y such plan n ave been suXfeficety_ e's'tira6te"d b_y the public. At the same time I am perfectly ready fully and carefully to consider any facts and arguments which may be laid before me bearing on that question, and then to take into censideration any detailed pian that mav be submitted for the purpose of carrying those views in'o effect. You must be aware that the great difiiculty of arranging a plan of taxation consists in the actual scale that may be adopted. The present income-tax, as levied last year, raised no less a sum than 16,000,0001., and it is not easy to propose any tax, direct or indirect, which would
ie so large a sum within the years without creating some complaint, I am afraid that those gentlemen who talk of a perfect system of taxation, and which would rmake
z distinction between permanent and precarious incomes, would find when they came to levy a large sum that they were deceived, and that the reality would fall short of their expectations. Where large sums of money are to be collected from the public in a limited time we must expect that some complsints wib be made. Now, the more
practical part of the question is that of the amount. I will
egin at once by saying that you must discharge from yonr minds the idea that the Government have any love of taxa-
tion in the abstract, or that they have any wish to maintain taxes which are not absolutely necessary for the public service. They have no desire to take advantage of the wording of an act of Parhament for the purpose of continuing taxation which is not necessary for the wants of the country. LetU, as a illustration, look atthe taxes imposed for the
eice of the war. There was first the tax on malt. With reference to the war taxes, I may say different forms of ord s were inserted in different statutes with regard to ,the period of their termination. The extra duty on malt usa delalred to end oa the 5th of July first alt$r the
termination of the war, or after the ratiflcations of peae wre excnanged. The resnlt ot tbat was that othe xtn duty on malt came to a coeclusion at the earliest possible moment that it could oome to an *nd-namely, in the beginning of the quarter next after the ratifications were xthanrlge Altbough the expense of this Fear have ben very heavy, conequent on the withdra*a of our troops and the winding up of the affairs of aSI extensive war, I did not taike any steps to continue that tax, or to propose the repayment of the heavy drawback to the extent Of 800.000. So you will oberve that Already, by the termination of that act of Parliament, the Exobequer bag lost, not only the addi'ional maltatax since the 6th of July last, but also the repayment of the draw. back on the stock in hand, which will fall not far short of l,OO,0001 I }nention this to show that no attempt was made to alter the intention of the Legislature with regard tothst statute. The war duties on tea, sugar, and coilee WiU erminate on the 5th of April next by law. No proposal was made last session to prolong the period for the cessation of those duties, Well, it so happens that the words used in regard to the Income-tax continue the war part of the tax for a year after the 6th of April next, and all I can say upon that point is that the Government will not take any advantage of the peculiar wording of that satute. (Hear, hear.) They wil act in the manner which it was stated by one of the deputation they had done
ith regard to the Sardinian loan, where the letter of the act of Parliament was in favour of this country And against the Eing of Sardinia. We thought in that cse it would be desirable and to the honour of the couniry not to take advantage of a few days in the wording of an act of Parliament, and we therefore continue the payment of the additional million. (Hear.) In the same spirit o course the Govermment would not avail themselves of the strictletterof anotheractof Parliament, and socontinue atax whichwasnotneeded bythrequirementsofthopublicservie. But having made that statement with regard to the rate of the Income-tax, it is a question not of taxation, but of expenditure. The question is what wilbe the expenditure of the following year. With regard to the interest of the debt there wil be some increase in consequence of the loans contractd during the war; but that increase wiLt not be very material. There will be 2,000,0001. of Excbequer-bonds which fall due in course of next year. Of course, they will fall within the expenises of next year. Well, the civil lit and the expenditure for civil parposes will not Yary very nuch, and you may learn what their probable amount will he from the statement of last year. The question of what will be the public expenditure of next year will turn mainly on the amount of the army and navy estimates. The question, in the present state of the country, is whaet amount will he required for the services of the army and navy. I can only state that tbese estima:es are sent to the Treasury for their approbation, end that, as they have not yet been officially communicated by these departments, the Government are not in possession of the details of the definitive estimates of the expenditure for the coming year, upon which expenditure the ways and means will depend. There is a difference in the way in which the House of Commons Proceeds in providing for the expenditure of the country rom ta opted by a private gentleman. A private gentleman, if he he prudent, first considers his income, and then regulates his expendituro according to his income. The
House ofCommons, on the otber hand, votes supplies to meet the service of the year, and, having done that in committee, then in a committee of ways and means votes the money to cover that expenditure. They first inquire -what is the expenditure of the country, and then vote the ways and means that will meet it. Then, if I understand you rightly, what yon mean is that the Government should reduce the taxation by S.000,001. (Hear.) Whst I say is that the Houso of Commons would begin'the proceeding in a different manner,
daptng the income to the expenditure, and not the expenditure to the income. That is all I can say at present ; but I have stated the matter with as much candour as I can, and as explicitly as the circumstances in which I am placed will admit. (Ilear.)
Mr. J HareES irCtAm%, a member of the deputation, said he considered the people of this country thought they had a claim for relief in this matter, in consequence of the wording of this particular act of Parliament, believing it was wholly without precedent, and contrary to the act of 1854, bywhich the tax vas increased from7d.in the ponid tol4d. The Chancellor ofthe Exchequersaid subsequentlyhewanted to add 2d. more to the tax, and the people believed that an error had crept into the phraseology of the act, inasmuch as the resolution of the House of Commons did not say that the 14d. and the extra 2d. were to continue for another year beyond the expiration of the war. It was aIso, he submitted, contrary to the precedent of 1816; and, besides, the Chancellor of the Exchequer had never told the country at the time of its imposition that the tax was to continue for one year after the end of that in which peace was proclaimed. In fact, this was taking 9,000,C001. from the people of this country wFithout the Government having Told them that they intended to do so.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCssxQtyst.-There was no mistake. The words used in the act renewing the Incometax are correct. The proper term to use is the " ratification, and not the " signature" of a treaty. The tea and sugar duties were made for a year, and the difference in the wording of the acts imposing them was accidental. The correct expression is the " ratification," not the "signature" because a treaty does not take effect until it is ratified. The interval is usually short, but sometimes it is protracted. With regard to the treaty of Amuiens, for example, there was an interval of six months between the signature and the ratification. A country does rnot disarn after the signature of a treaty, as the treaty may be disavowed and the expenses may therefore be kept up. I repeat, however, that nothing practical will turn upon the precise words of the act. (Hear, hear.) There is no disposition on the part of the &overnment to take any undue advantagd of the technicalities of the case. (Hear, hear.) They will be guided by the substantial wants of the country, and by these alone; and therefore you may banish from your minds the idea that the Government have any disposition to deal wvith this question in a pettifogging way, or with anything like chicenery. (Hear, hear.) No such idea ever entered my mind. There is no doubt as to the construction of the actit is a tax payable for another year; but there is no wish to found any claim upon that beyond what is necessary for the service of the year. (Hear, hear.)
MajorRExED thanked the right hon. gentleman forthe great courtesy and candou,r with which he had received the deputation and felt ssured that the statement he had made that the Government had no disposition to inSsist on a strict literal constructionl of the act of Parliament in question wvould give satisfaction to the wvhole country.
The deputation then retired.
Opposition To The Income-Tax.
OPPOSITION TO THE INCOM-TAYX.
STROTThn
A. public meeting was held here on Thursday night " for the purpose of considering the propniety of petitioning Paruihaentfor the repeal of the Income-tax." It was stated in lPe Tinws a fear weeks ago that a pledge had been agreed toby 500 of the electors ef the borough not to 'vote for antY candidate for its representation in Parliament who would not support a total and iiomediate repeal of the Income-tax. Since that period A great deal of excitementt has been kept up in the borough by the agitstion of the quetion, and the borough has been plentifally placarded. At length it was determined to hold the presentmeeting, and long before the hour appointed the large room in which it was held, and vhich is capable of holdin 1,500 persons, was crowded to the doors. Mr. Horaman, h.P., and Mk. Scrope were on the platforn. IsIr. W. 1. Stanton was called to the chair.
Ijr. J. PAsTRIDGro moved the first resolution:-
* That the metting Is ot opinion that the Drmeent icome-tax of Is. 4d, in the pound Ms, from its enormous amount, moot oppresiv and injurious to the profren,onal, manufacturing, und commercial i U
terests of this contry; thathavinc been raised solely to defray the expneeta of the war. it is, on the return of peace no longer neces.ary; acid that Ita continuance beyond. the Sth of April next weould W a violation of the promiae3 made at the tirne of its enactment, and a breach of good failh on the part of the Govcrnment."
The resolution was carried.
Mr. HoL:%Es then moved the following:-
T.at tLe present form of Ioome tbx on trades nsd profeeplass is uncusuMal eavrerilty onndnglaexstrdy, sod. i4 totgallSy unfict fodr ta free cosutIty and that the Dmeeting stronglyurges the Government to make provision fur its imDmediate amendment, and for its tota repeal in ISSOe."
Dir. G. HOLLOWA&Y, manufacturer, seconded the resolution.
Dfr. B. WJnR'vxT1aom, banker, wvas dcsirous of explain. ing to the mteting that the resolutions which had been submnitted were rather a compromiso of extreme opinions on both sides.
The resolution having been carried, the two members for the borough addressed the meeting.
Mr. Scnori said, he had always advocated thoencome-tax, and had supported its increase during the war, but now that peace was restored the qucstion asqumed a different aspect, and he did not wonder at the impatience which had been inasifested throughout the country A the prospect of the continuance of the war tax under these altered circumstances. He had, however, no reason to believe that it would be continued to that extent, and was not aware that the Govezrmenthad committed themselves to a continu ance of the war portion of the tax after the 6th of April next.
'He hoped it would not, and he was of opinion that it ought I not, to be continued. But when they talked about a total abolition of the Income-tax he could only say that was one of the pleasing delusions which some people would indulge in, bhut which he could not sake up his mind to be possible.
Mr. HoitsmAN said, he assented to the general Eentinents expremsed in the resolutions which had been passed, but int passing these resolutions they must remember that if they repealed the tax they mnst find a substitute. He felt it his duty, therefore, to tell them what were his opinions on financial legislation. It was all very well to say that the Income-tax was an abominable tax and one that must be got rid of, bht before they got rid of it let them look back to its bistory. Mr. Aorsman then entered into an elaborate history of the tax; and read a letter which he had received from a non-elector of Stroud, humourously pointing out tho mischievous tendency of the pledge system, and aubmitted that as other constituencies might follow the example of Stroud great difcalties might arise. They might have a large number of members so pledged to a total and immediate abolition, and one of the remnnant of the Protectionist party taking advantage of it might rise and propose the repeal of the tax as founded upon a false principle of direct taxation. The result might be that the Protectionist memnbers of the House of Commons, voting for the repeal of the tax in conformaity with their principles, and the pledged members voting also for it in conformity with their pledges, the -tax would be abolished; and, following up the principle, a tax upon the importation of corn would be reimposed, and all the advantages which we have gained from free trade would be lost. (Cries of "' No, ho !" and a voice "No danger !") If they foUowed out this principle there miglht b)e danger ia other caze5 if
not in this. He maintained also that pledging their zrpresentatives to a repeal of the Incomotax pledged them- aso to a repeal of the Property-tax. Parliament wag pledged to oontsnue the tax until 1860, and our fiasciAc &rrangementg had all been based upon that assumption ; it would be the greatest breach of Parliamentary faith If that xDledge were to be broken. He bad no doubt that constituencies might Let men who would pledge themselves. They might get plenty of what he had heard caDed the "Redpaths" and "Agars" pledged to do their work in PArliament ; but no snen going to the House of Commons, losing tbeir own self-rspect, would respect the interest or astain the character of their constituents. (Cheers.) lHe objected to constituencies pledging themselves as much as bo objected to representatives pledging themselves. No one could tell what would be the state of their financial information in 1860. Pinancial knowledge was in its gifancy, and he objected to constituencies binding themselves by a, bond that if they were wiser in 1860 than they had been in 1857 they should place themselves in ruch a position that they could not mzake use of their increased, wisdom3. He only learnt the resolution of the electors of Stroud through the medium of an Irish paper, where he read the declaration under a title in large characters of " Notice to quit." He found on reading it that it was a - Notice ao quit, fron, the electors of Stroud; this was the first intimntson he had had of their intentions. Now, they migbt depend on it that in political matters public meetings and open discussions were the great safeguards to truth, and thar concealment and issysiezy were the parents of injustice, anything like socresy tending to lead to mistakes. With regard to the continuance of the war 9d. he was no more in the secret than his colleague Mr. Scrope, but he would say that the character of the Chanoellor of the Exchequer for bigh honoar was auch that he did not believe he would take advantage of such a pettifogging devise as was imagined by some people to prolonz the imposition hir nothzr ye2r. He had no hesttation instating hi6 conviction tha the spirit of the act of Parliamient would be adhered to, and that the war tax would expire a year after the war was cnded. It was a matter of course that the war being ended the Additional tax was no longer required and would be dispensed with. Then the question arose, what was to be done with the remaining 7d. This was a question in which the interests of their representatives were directly even with their own ; they had indeedZ a greater interest tbai1 many of the constituency in putting an end to the tax. But if they put an ena to it what was to be substituted for it! They would bave to decide, first, the principle on which taxation was to be levied; and secondly, what was tbe best tax by which they could raise the necesSary revenues of the country. Ile had aivways understood that the best and most politic tax was that wbich embraced three advantages, viz,-that most just in operation, most productive in amount, and collected at the east cost and with the least irritation and annoyance. (Elear, hear.) These were, in his opinion, the three principles on which they shonld proceed, Did the Income-%a,x of 7d. in the pound fulfil, more than any other, all these conditions 2 If it did, then it might be continued; if it did no-, it ought to be abolished. The general optnioa of the meeting, as expressed by its resolution, was that it did not. But let tbem remember that this tax had been laid on very calmly, very deliberately, and was considered as a great act of statesmanship. They might perhaps wish the Incometax was sunk to the bettonm of the sea; but when they found the operation of indirect taxation in decreasing prosperity they would he glad to send oner of thelr Income-tax commissioners in a diving-bell to fish it up again. They had to choose between a coutinualce of the direct Income-tax and a return to the system of indirt taxation which existed before Sir R. 1eeI imposed the Income-tax in 1842. He had not heard any one say he 'would hlke to go back to indirect taxation imposed on the consun ption of the general necessaries o: life. The indirect taxes on the necessaries of life fell chiefly on the poorer classes of society, while the Income-tax fell on the commercial, trading, and manufacturing classes. [Mr. Holloway. -No; it is principally paid by the consumners of commodities.] Mr. mlors-an contended that it was paid directly by the commercial, manufacturing, and trading community, and that the adoption of the system of indirect taxation would involve a return to class legislation, which had been so much condemned. Therefore he would say, Let them consider well what they were doing. Mr. Horaman next alluded to the original exemption fronm this tax of incomnes under 1501. per annum. lhis exemption was based by Sir Robert Peel not on principle, but on policy, and on a fact which could not be denied-viz., the dificulty of collecting the tax on incomes descending lower in the scale, the cost of collection, independent of the irritation engendered, being more than the tax was worth. On these grounds he (MIr. Horsinan) thought Sir Robert Peel's exemption of incomes under 1501. very wise and politic. In conclusion, he said rigid economy in every departnent of the Governnent must be insisted on. They ought also to prepare themselves for another thing-viz., a ene revison of the whole taxation of the country. .Cheersj) His opinion was that in a very few years one of the great questions which would foroe itsolf u.pon Parliament woould be a general revision of the whole system of taxation of the country. With these views, paying the utmost deference to the wishes, the opinions, and the expressed will of his constituents, it was his duty and that of hiscolleague to consider thatthey owed aduty also to the community at large -to pursue that course which would sustain their own character while it also sustained the character and promoted the interests of those whom they represented. (Loud cheers.)
The right hon. member addressed the meeting for twa hours, and was listened to with the deepest attention.
NEWBURY.
A meeting has been held here to determine upon a petition to Parliament for a reduction or total repeal of the Income-tax.
Mr. dvward Wilson, the mayor, presided, ands.mong those present were Mr. Alderman Gray and several other members of the corporation, the Rev. J. Drew, and a, number of highly-respectable inhabitants.
The M. YOR opened the meeting, and denounced the precent mode of levyingthe lncome-tax as most injurious, obnoxious, and oppressive, particularly to the industrious; classes, the tradesmen, and professional gentlemen.
thMr.f; TstU siz, a towFn conncilman, moved a resolution to
aTha that portion of the Income-tax orginally leied to meet the expene of the war thould be forthwith abolbshed."
(Cheers.) A property tax was about the best, he believed, that could be levied; but when a tax, such as the Income. tax, was made to bear equally on those who had real property and on those whose incomes were derived from trades and professions, it was unfair ard monstrously unjust. The inequality was so gross that he hoped the country would not cease to agitate until the thx was abolEshed. (Loud cheers.)
Mar. HICrx IsA another member of the corporation, seconded the mnotion. IIe said the tax was pronised to be only "I temnporary," but already it had been endured 14 years.
ahe motion was carried amid loud cheering.
The IRev. J. DRtw spoke of the tax as having in its operation tended to check the philanthropic and benevolent feelings of the country, and he considered that the mode of levying the tax was not only unjust and offensive, but un-English. (Cheers.) It was his firm conviction that in the days of John Hampden or Oliver Cromwell this tax vould not have been borne 14 months, much less, as now, 14 years. He moved as a resolution-
" That the Present mode of levying tbh Income-tax upon incomes derived fronn precarious soorces is clearly snjusit add be mnode of assessment offensive and inqulitorial.,
The motion was seconded by Mr. FIELDRR, a councilman, and carried unanimously.
Alderman GRAY moved a resolution-
' That as pernona *hore incomes range from £100 to _Lio per annumn often experience great dillinuity In presiding for the wants and ed.cation of their families. tibi mieting conceives that all Incomes of the former amount should he relievedi frinn the tax. aud tbat the fleet LiSa shonid be exemupt i all lucmes je excems of thlat hum"
This motion was seconded by Mr. Ryorr, supported by Ir. T.ALIOT, solicitor, and carried unanimously.
A form of petition to Parliament was agreed upon, and s resolution passed, requesting that 3r. Robert Palmer, Viscount Barrington, and Mr. G. E. Vansittart, the three members for the county, should support its prayer on its being presented to the Elouse of Conmmons.
TORIQUAY.
A public meeting of the inhabiauts of this town washeld in the Town-hall, on Thursday, to consider the propriety of petitioning Parliament in favour of the abolition of the Income-tax. The Rev. R. Wolfe presided.
Mr. PAnK, MI.P. for South Devon, addressed the meeting, and in the course of his speech he aaid,-I hold that no income-tax whatever can ever be consistent with the principles of justice and equity. (Hear, hear.) I lay that down as A fundamental rule that nothing cmn be more unjust than the Income-tax- nothing can be less desirable for the country; and that it iS a tax which is to be applied for, and used for but one purpose, and that is a purpose of great emergency, when the country is menacedby battle or some other great disaster; but that it is a tax which bears heavily and unfairly upon the industry of this cosuwtry, and as one that should be resorted to only for the last object. (Sheers.) I very much doubt whethcr you will hear anything from the Crown to lead yoa tv sluPpose that this Income-tax will b
cone wtnont. I do not beliove that the Goiernment will take advantage of that " quibble" which would enable them to maintain the 9Ld for another year ; but I do believe that the Chancellor of the Exchequer wi have to appeal to the patriotism of the country, and to ask them to renew that 9d. for another year.
It was proposed by Mr. MAnRl and seconded Mlr.

Another resolution, declaring the Income-tax to bo despotic and inquisitorial, that a more equitable mode of iosmposingit should be immediately adonted, and that thl0 bill brought in hy the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Gladstone, in 18li1, for the abolition of the taxinlStsO, should he faithfully adhercd to, wras also proposed, and both resolutions were camred.

PARI, THUMMDAY, JAN. 22, 6 P.M.
Private letters from various parts of Switzerland speak of the deatiafaction whih is WauifestiFng itself against the Government. This dissatisfaction is caused by the suspicion that the Swim people have not been fairly dealt with in the question of Neuchaftell; they are struck by the discrepancy existing between the language of the Swiss papers and the Prussian and French press. I fear there has been some indiscretion or mismanagement i
the aifir. When Dr. Kern returned to Berne from his first viaitto Paris, a week or two ago, he declared in the presence of the commisgion, and he repeated the same to others of the Council of States, of which he is himself a member, that while here he held in his hands and read letters from the King of Prussia in which His Majesty pledged himself (confldentially) that if the prisoners were previously liberated
he would renounce his rights to the Principality. i I believe he further stated, or allowed it to be understood, that the letters were given to him for
perusal at the Foreign-office, or at the Palae of the I Tuileries. This was probably meant by him to be in confidence; but how the Doctor could suppose that a secret which was communicated to so many persons could long remrain a secret it is difficult to understand. The fact was published in the Swiss papers. The Prussian Ministerial press denied strongly that the King had given any such engagement, and the Paris papers declared in turn that the Swiss Confederation had at last accepted the conditions proposed in the month of October last, and that the Imperial Government had not changed in any one point the language it originally held On one side, the Swiss Envoy speaks of written, though confidential engeagements-though not less binding for that on honourable minds; while, on the other, we are day after day assured that there is no such engagement, private or official, as was announced to the Federal Coucil. WVhat party are we to believe? It is quite clear, however, that it was on that understanding the people of Switzerland received with pleasure the conclusion of an arrangement without an appeal to arms. It was not extraordinary that the King of Prussia should have been anxious to save hisarwtnrln-opre, and that the Emperor Napoleon should be also disposed to spare the feeling of his Royal ))rot' Jl; and that Switzerland, satisfied with obtauinig what she demanded, would make light of mere appearances. But the question now is, has Dr. Kern reaUy seen letters, confidential or otherwise, of which he has spoken; or do they exist? Thisweshall, no doubt, soonascertain. Inthe meantime, the Swiss, who have acted in a straightforward unsuspecting manner in the affair, begin to suspect that they have been duped, and that the honour of the Confederatioa is affected. If they are to trust to the honesty or firmness of the Prussian Government their security is but slight indeed. They have iberatd the prisoners,whom the Swiss Government should have brought to trial long ago, and in return they now only get what was offered thern in October last-not more, if it be not less. If only sucL a result be obtained, where was the necessity of disturbing the Swiss population from their occupations, of moving troops about, and of imposing on a poor country an expense of 7,000,000 or 8,000,000 francs?f
Dr. Kern arrived in Paris yesterday, and I believe stays some days. It is very likely that he will be one of the members of the Conference. London will probably be the place of meeting, but neither on that poit nor on the day it will take place, has anything been decided as yet.
I learn that the Paris papers have been recommended to give as few extracts as possible from the Swiss papers on the question of NeuchfteL Some of the liberated prisoners are reported to have arrived in Paris.
MM. Reverchon and Thiercelin, the barristers who were appointed by the Court to support Verger's appeal to the Court of Cassation, have claimed the delay of ten days granted to the convict to prepare his arguments in support of his appeal according to the 423d and 425th articles of the Code Napoleon. On Tuesday Verger wvrote to M. Achille Morin, an advocate practising at the Court of Cassation, to request him to undertake his defence. The convict, in his letter, expresses great confidence in the result of his appeal, and likewise his belief that his conviction will be quashed. "If it were otherwise," said he, "one must believe that justice is banished from the earth, and one should exclaim, with the great Apostle. to die is an advantage. It will be a gain for me and a gain for my enemies." M. Morin hastened to visit Verger, whG declared that he would take advantage of the delay allowed by law. The appeal, consequently, cannot be heard this week by the Court of Cassation. Next week, no doubt, the cause will be heard. In a second petition to the Emperor Verger beseeches His Majesty to convoke the Court of Cassation, as he intends to defend himself before it, and "C Iwill not give up my right," said he, "unless the clemency of IHis Majesty should render it unlnecessary." At the request of Verger he has been permitted the use of his right arm, and since then he has recovered from the dejection under which he laboured since his conviction. From the momenit that he was allowed the use of his arm he has shown himself as tranquil and almost as indifferent as he was previous to his trial. During the entire day he never ceases to write, and it is with difficulty he lays down ais pen to take his meals. He has written more than 50 pages, which he calls his testamentary dispositions. He several times requested the director of the prison to return his sincere thanks to the authorities for the liberty granted to him to use his right hand. " You see," said he, " that I am no longer the same man I was last evening. I can work now! That is all I desired. I will wait with resignation the reply to my petition for mercy which I addressed to the Emperor, and on which I confess I found some hope, for I have a clear conscience. I am not a dangerous maan; a sms.l corner of the earth may be given to me without fear, no matter where, provided that I can walk a little, work, write a great deal-that is all I ask. If, contrary to my expectation, I am considered dangerous, let me be 'suppressed' from society; I am ready to conform to the supreme decision." During the day two sisters of charity of Jossigny (Seine et Marne) who had k-nown Verger when he had the care of the parish of Seris, came to the prison of the Roquette to visit the convict and to give hirm an image of the Virgin which had been blessed for his service. Verger desired that they should be told he very much regretted the trouble they had taken for him-that he sincerely thanked them, but that desiring to remain quiet, and in future not to receive anybody, he was sorry he could not receive them. It appears, however, that his resolution not to receive visits is not absolute, for the Bishop of Meaux having asked if he would consent to receive him Verger replied that he would receive with the greatest pleasure and the most profound respect his visit, his consolations,, and even his, remonstrances.
The following letter was dictated by Verger to NI. Ragal.y for his, father, immediately after his condemnation .-
*My poor Father,-What a trial for you and for all the family ! But take courage;so long as the guillotime shaU not have beenerected, and,imy head shall not havo fallen, you will still have reason to hope. I embrace you with all the fila affection rwich a son should have for his father. Em. brace for me my mother-in-law, my brothers, sister, and other relatives. "Your son,
After the signature was added-" And tell my brother to embrace Clemence for me."

THE EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA AT MILAN.
(1¶ox Ova OWN COIt2MrOiWZNT.)
MILAN, J". 17.
On Thursday, the 15th, the Emperor of Austria made his solemn entry into the Lombard capital, which city he hlis not visited since 1851, and of his reception on that occasion he does not appear to cherish very fond recoUections. This time,however, as you have repeatedly heard, the local Government has been indefatigable In getting up a display that might look as like enthusiasm and happiness as anything false and fictitious may represent reality; and to the honour of Baron Burger, the Lieutenant of Lombardy, Signor Martinez, the Director of Police, and MonsiRnor Romilly, Archbishop of Milan, it must be said that the whole mise eni sc&e was most admirably managed as a theatried exhibition. The inanimate sco arrangements consisted in some pasteboard erections (for the most part in very good taste), as, for instance, a kind of kiosk at Loretto, a vilage about a mile from the town on the Bergamo road, where the Emperor and Empress were to alight and dress, and receive the homage of the Milanese aristocracy; a triumphal arch at the "Porta Orientale," through which the procession was to pass; and a Gothic cross in front of the Cathedral; together with posts decorat"ed with flags and garlands at nintervals all along theline from Loretto to the town end of the Corso Orienstale. The houses on either side along the whole line from Loretto to the Royal Palace were of coue embelUisled with something or other hung frorm every window-that is, in compliance with a standing order of the police for all Imperial f6tes-and the streets were swept and fresh sanded during rthe night previous to the arrival.
It is difficult in the united efforts of the triad of authority above-mentioned to distinguish clearly to which any particular effect is due, but I believe the Archbishop deserves most credit for the town having been inundated even on Wednesday with peasants, who probably never left it until after the great event of Thursday, for the streets were thronged with them at a very early hour on the morning of Thursday. The exhortations of the country clergy in tLe neighbourhood, under his instructions, most likely produced this; but whoever was the originator of the sc}heme deserves great praise, for it was wonderfully successful, and on Thursday, when the Emperor passed, there was not above one per thousand of Milauese to country people in the line of proce3sion, so completely had the latter taken possession of the town.
The entry, which was at first announced for 11 a.m., was postponed to 2p.m., and, finaly, about 3 p.m. the guns of the citadel made known to the lieges the arrival of their Majesties at Loretto. To Loretto 108 gentlemen of Milan went to meet and greet thse Emperor, of whom 60 were unofficial, ansd must, therefore, be considered as volmnteers, though some I have heard wont under terror of the conscription law being enforced against their sons. The Emperor, I have been told, addressed very few words to these gentlemen, but sai(d he was glad to see there were so many.
The Imperial and Apostolic toilets hang beeno made, the Emperor and Empress started in an open carriage, followed by their suite, and by so many of the carriages of those gentlemen who wont forth to meetht them authoritie thought worthy to join in the trae. Arrived at the cis gate, they were of course, received b the Poeats, Count Sebregondi, who read an address to the Emperor ful of ornramental phrases, but containing also a hope that the Imperial vistt would contribute to the improvement of the city, and that His Majesty would himself perceive the increasing wants caused by the progress of society, which was, for some reason or other, entirely omitted in the report given by the Governrent Gahste. His ajesty replied that he was willing to forget all that had occurred within those walls, and hoped the Milanese would give him reason to exercise his clemency. The windows and balconies of almost all the houses along the route of the procession were more or less occupied; but there were some exceations which it is said the Emperor himself observed and remarked upon, particularly the houses of Count Arese and the Marq Crivelli, as he seems to have expected that the political refugees wouldhavereturned to meet hIn, whereas there were only two, the Dukce Litta and the Marqla s Raimondi. Notwithstanding the vast crowd of persons thus collected to witness this show, there was not, as far as I was able to judge, the slightest enthusiasm-certainly none within earshot of where I was myself, and, from what 2 have been able to learn from others, none elsewhere, except at the covered way where the Imperial party passed on foot from the Cathedral to the Palace, and where it was said the police had stationed their best wlesuth. I ought to have mentioned that the weather was remarkably propitious-a clear, crisp, frosty atmosphere, with bright sunshine. It is hardly necessary to say that there was a great display of troops on the occasion, and these to the number of 15,000, as the Govern-
ient Ga2ette announces, defiled before the Emperor after he reached the palace. The same evening the Emperor andEmpress went to theScala. The theatre was well filled, but not with the right people, that is, notthose who are ordinarily there. It was a packed house, in fact, and the packing was well enough done, had it not been that the zeal of the packed carried them beyond the bounds of reason. The applause given to the Emperor and Empross was infinitely greater onl this oCcaSiOD than the most DpoUlar Sovereign in Europe could have any right to expect. From half-past 7 till half-past 8 the audience was kept waiting for the iLperial presence, but at last, when the Emperor and Empress entered, the long suppressed sentiments of loyalty btst forth like a torrent breasking into a new courset so that if a perfect dtranger had been present he might well have fancied the Emperor Francis Joseph was adored by the bilanese, wfhereas every one knows that they are discontented. But this was not all; at the eo d of each act the same thing was repeated, and when the Imperial party rose to go away the house was convulsed in tho midst of the ballet. On Friday there were receptions at Court. The Emperor received all the different civil and religious corporate bodies and the military, and afterwards the Empress held a Court. The Emperor's receptions were of course numerously attended, seeing that all the persons who rent to pay their court were officials of one sort or another, but the number of ladies was extremely limited, there being only 25 Lombards, one Piedmontese, one Tuscan, and five or six Germans. This paucity of femnale aristocracy at Court in a city which boasts of 600 noble families seemstohave astonishedsome ofthe German courtiers, for the Countess Esterhazy, the Chief Lady of the Empress, remarked that it would be impossible to establish a Court at MIilan, since there were no materials from which to form it. You mnay conceive the dismay of the Milanese on learning next day this deliberate opinion of suchl an experienced person. But the most annoying thing to those
laxes wno eiI go to Uourt was no doubt that their female friends and relations were either in their balconies cr in the Place of the Cathedral to see them pass as they went to the palace, and possibly said ill-natured things of them afterwards. At the reception by His Majesty the chief points that seemn to have caused remark were, that when he received the magisterial body he amused himself by knocking his spurs together to relieve himself from the ennui of a very tedious day of receptions, and in reply to the Central Congregation he said, " Gentlemen, I hope you will know how to preserve the provinces which you represent in sentiments of fidelity to my person." On the whole Ris Majesty's manner has not producE d a favourable effect on those who went to Court; they say he is stiff and morose, while the Enpress has made herself a reputation for anuability and prgvenance, and her good looks have gained her many admirers of both sexes.
On the evening of Friday the Court again went to the Scala, rather unexpectedly, so that I was in hopes there might have been a chance of seeing the Emperor and the Milanese brought face to face in a natural state, but this was'not allowed. On Thursday evening everything was prepared, but it was very amusing to see the desperate " whip" made on Friday to fiU the theatre, to do honour to their Majesies. It was only late in the afternoon that notice was given that the Scala was to be lighted "I a giomno," thereby intimating that
the Empeior ias to beipre~ent. There was not |much fear of the house being well attended even if
this notice had not been prorulgated, as the box[going public of Milan have for the most part renounced the theatre for the season, in order that their absence during the Royal visitmnight not appear invidious; but after the announcement it became necessary to make arrangements for filling even the pit. Theperformancewasadvertised in the supplementary notice beforementioned to commenec at half-past 7, and the Opera (the Trovatore) to begin with the third act, which their Maje8ties had not waited to see the night before. I went into the pit about 8 o'clockt and found the first four rows, asusa, crowded with Austrian officers, (these seats, which occupy the best part of the pit, have been taken possession of by the garrison by right of conquest, and are now raied off for the exclusive use of the rmilitary,) besides a fair sprinkling of uniforms in other parts of the house, but the pit was far from full, and quite half tho boxes were unoccupied. I presently perceived a gentleman, who was standing near me, and who bad been surveying the different tiers of boxes w th much attention, beckon to a police commissary in uniobrmn, with a cocked hat and three atars on his collar. The commissary removed his hat with great respect when signalled to, and approached may neighbour, from whom he received some instrue. tions apparently (their conversation was carried oa in whispers), and then went out. Shortly after the exit of the commissary there was an influx of men into the pit, of that peculiar type that at once proclaimed them as some of the lowest agents of the police. About a quarter past 8 the opera commenced without their Majesties, and it was not until halfpast 8 (an hour after the time named), aad after Giulini had Sung the miserere, that the Emperor and Empress entered the state box. On their arrival the performance was stopped for a few moments while the audience rose to applaud Royalty-the applaus being comparatively less than the night bfore in the same proportion as the assemblage was less numerous. In the meantime many of the formerly unoccupied boxes had become tenanted, so that the dearth of society was not so remarkable, and after a while in came the commissary again and approached my neighbour, to whom he gave sotto voce explanations, and pointed out with his chin divers parts of the house, all which seemed highly satisfactory to the gentleman in mufti, for he smiled approval on the official in uniform. Still my neighbour was not quite easy in his mind. There was apparently one particular box the emptiness of which seemed to give him anxiety. He went to the entrance of the pit and caUed the attention of several people standing there connected with the theatre to the deserted state of that box, and they all looked at it and evidently spoke much about it, but 'what. ever opinions they may have offered on the subject generally ended in a toss of the head and a shrug of the shoulders, and, as the box remained tenantless, I presume the proprietors must have had a friend at Court, though not at the Court of Francis Joseph. I should have observed that on the night preceding the police took possession of the boxes not occupied by the proprietors or their friends, and there were not more than six boxes on the second tier occupied by their right owners. On Friday night the Imperial party made their retreat almost unobserved, and thero was consequently, no clapping of hands on their retirement.
PRUSSIA.
(IuOM OTJR OWN COnRESeOhnNTr.)
BEBIRIN, J.A. 21.
It is now nearly two months since I have had occasion to mention the two Houses of the Landtag, or Diet, as it is now correct to call the two Chambers of what ought to be a representation of the Prussian people. This has arisen not so much from the importance of other passing events, although lNTeuchfltel must hear a large portion of the blame of my omission, as from the perfect insig,nificance of their proceeding. This would become only too obvious if I should attempt a rdsina of what little has been done since their opening on the 29th of November of last year. It will, however, be more profitable if, instead of recapitulating past nonentities, I report that yesterday at last there did occur something of interest to the rest of the world; it consisted of a communication made by the Minister-President Baron von Mfanteuffel to the House of Deputies on the subject of the present state of the Neuchatel conflict, and was as follows:-
"Gentlemen,-At the opening of the present session of the Landtag His Majesty the King indicated, at the close of his speech, the contingency in which, with reference to the events that have taken place in NeuchMtel, he was resolved to call out the rUilitary power of the country. We were Willing, prepared, and able, had that contingency sau pervened, to vindicate the rights of the King by force of arms, but the necessity to do so no longer exists. We have at length received informaation tbat those subjects of the King who were detained in prison in Neuchitel have been unconditionally set at liberty. It 'will therefore be possible now to settle the future position of Neuchatel at a Euro pecan Congress.
"G &entlesmen,-You will find it, I am sure, perfectly natural that I confine myself to this very brief notice ; but, such as it is, I was unwlling to withhold it from you, on account of the high interest connected with the subject."
My letter of yesterday mentioned that the Prussian Government had as early as the 17th inst. addressed a circular despatch to its representatives abroad, stating its willingness to enter into negotiations for the regulation of the future relations of Neuchatel, now that its preliminary stipulation had been fulfilled by Switzerland, and this statement of the Minister President points out how the negotiations are to be carried on. The plan of a Conference of the European Powers has certainly the very best reasons in its favour, but I am not aware whether this Government is in possession of any more definite grounds for choosing that course.
Of course, all the world has known a good deal more fully and a good deal earlier than the inhabitants of these parts what has been going on in Switzerland during the late crisis, for not only were the diplomatic relations between the Governmeu1ts of Prussia and Switzerland interrupted, but also all letters addressed from there to here were written with the greatest circumspection and caution, on account of the danger attendant on being suspected of Royalism by a population so excited as the Radical fraction of Switzerland has been lately. In addition to these causes of a scarcity of
Swiss news here must be mentioned the parental I care shown by this Government in preventing its subjects from being unnecessarily vexed by those naughty Swiss; the officials of the Prussian telegraph station in Franldort had orders to transmit no Swiss intelligence of an exciting nature; and the Swiss papers that contained anything of the sort were either withheld by the police or by the proprietors of places of public resort. This course is no extraordinary innovation, but is in strict conformity with the provisions of the law governing the press and the practice of the police in connexion with it; nothing must be allowed to appear in the columns of any journal that will pro. duce excitement or excite attention (wtas auffaUelk erregt, means something between the two); and it is also in conformity with that cardinal axiom of the civic morality of Prussia and Germaany, viz., 1uhe ist die erste Biirgeryfticht (" Tranquillity is the foremost of civic duties)." It may be easily imagined that where such views as these prevail in adminis-

trative ancsI private citdes, socia and poitca lf resembles only a stagnant pool, overgrown with bureaucratic duckweed, which, while it affords high delight to the ducks and geese that float at the top, keeps all below in a pitiful state of darksome ennuz.
As regards the terms the King is likely to stipulate for when the question of his ceding his rights to the sovereigaty of NeuchItel comes before the Conference, the only thing I hear is, that in general terms he will demand an indemnity for the revenue that he used as Prince to derive from the State domains in NeuchAtel, viz., about 30,000 thalers (4,5001.). I bear nothing about his retaining this, that, or the other chateau,-nor about bargaining to have the Prussian flag waving over their battlements. I cannot affirm positively that such things will not be talked of somewhere or other, u'ot as yet I do not hear anything of them here.

In this case a settlement was made by Charles Maddison, whereby 5,00D1. was vested in trustee names, Pughe and Manu1, upon trust (after payment of an annuity), during the minority or until the mariage of an infant, Catherine Maddison Baker, which should first happen, to pay and apply the interest, dividends, and annual produce of the fun IAt auy period thereafter, or so much thereof as the trustees for the time being should deemn sufficient, for the maintenanco and education of the infant, and after the infant should attain 21 the settlement contained various trusts of the fend settled, and the interest thenceforth to accrue thereon for the child or children of Catherine hMaddison Baker, if any, with A power of appointment in default of children, and a gift over in default of appointment to the next of kin of the settlor. In a subsuet pat of the settlement it was declared that it should be lawful for the trustees for the time being, if they thought propr so to do, during the infant's minority, to invest so much of the income of the fund to which the infant should be entitled as might not be applied for her maintenance and education, an that it shoild be lawful for the trustees to transfer the fund so invested to the iant at 21, but with power to apply the whole income of any one year, if necessary, for her maintenance. Charles Maddison, by his wiU,' bequeathed a further sum of 5,0001. to the trastees of this settlement on the same trusts as therein declared. Aless amount than the nnuMl proceeds of the trust fund waas applied for the maintenance of Catherine taddison Baker, atnd the surplus was invested.

This cause came on to be re-argued on a petition of rehearing. lr. Malkdn, by his will, gave a freehold house to his wife for her life, aud desired |her to make a will and to divide the moneys " or freehold property' upon her death among the survivors of his children as might be living as nearly equal as she could, making an allowance for what one had had meore than another, and in case she should not carry on the business in which he was then engagd le empowered her to sell the freehold house and to apply the interest of the money for her own benefit and to the bringing up of his younger children. He left eight children, four of whom predeceased their mother. She by her will appointed the freehold house equally among her living children and the representatives of those who had died, each set of representatives taking one share only. The first point raised was whether the a pointment of the wife was or was not valid. The secona whether the words "to divide the moneys or freehold property" implied a power of sale. The third, in whom the poerof sle if was vested. The fourth, whetherall the children iLvig at the death of their father or those ouly who survived their mother were objects of the gift; and lastly, whether they took the estate as money or land.
Mr. Keene appeared for the plaintiffs; Mr. Rolt, Mr. W. H. Harrison, and Mr. Bates for the defendants.
The VICE-CHANCELLOR, said he had no doubt that Mrs. Malkin, had misconceived the object of the power, and now therefore the appointment, as attempted to be exercised by her, was void, and that the parties took as in default of appointment. That the words made us of by the testator impied a power in no natnra of a trust for sale, and that under the circumstances the estato had descended upon the heir-at-law, subject to a trLst for sale. As to the former point his _Eonour e.xpressed some doubt, bt t on the authoriaty ofY' Kingstnv ~nneldy"(2 Jacob and
of their mother were the only objects of the power, and that they wrere entitied to the property in equal shares as personal estate.
TODD V. STUDHOLIW.?
This was a suit instituted by the representative of one Robert Todd, who was mortgageo for 1,0001. on part of an estate formerly belonging to one Hodgson, the mortgagor, whose estate had been administered in this court in a creditor's suit, and the funds, which were insafficient for the payment of his debts in full, had been apportioned among his creditors, without any reference to the plaintiff's charge. It appeared that the usual decree had been made for the sale of his estates, and that Robert Todd, the nortgagee, had a short time before his death joined in executing a deed of conveyance of the mortgaged estate to a purchaser, which deed recited in the usual way that the purchase money had been paidi into courct. The solcitor for Todd in. this transaction was also the solicitor for the purchaser; but, notwithstanding this, and also notwithstani g (as was alleged) that the solicitors for the plaintiffs in the administration suit had full notice of Tod 's charge, the decree, on further directions, had dealt with al the moneys which had been paid into court in the manner above mentioned, making no provision for the pricpal and interest due to Todd, which the plaintiff in this suit now sought to have recouped. For this purpose a variety of defendants, filling all possible characters, had been brought before the (ourt,-specialty and simple contract creditors of the mortgagor who had shared in the funds; the representatives of Todd's solicitor who had since died; the surviving partner in the firm of which the same gentleman had been a member; the soelcitors for the plaintiff in the administration suit; and lastly the purchasers of the mortgaged estate under the decree, all these several parties being c'tirged by the bill with full notice of Todd's mortgage. The chief points of discussion seemed to be between the co-defendants, each seeking to impute blame to the other, and none being apparently willing to take any on himself. At the conclusion of the argutments,
The VICE-CHANCELLOR said, that the precise shape of the decree would require some consideration, and he accordingly reserved his judgment.

Xbhis case came before the CoQrt upon a demurrer to the defendant's plea.
The declaration alleged that the plaintiffwas the owner of certain dwvellinghonses, occupied by his teuants, abutting on a public highway in the town of Brecon, and that the defendant maliciously Cut down and lowered the highway before the gates of the plaintiff's houses, and thereby prevented the plaintiff and his tenants from having access to the said highway as they had been accustomed. The defendant, except to the allegation that the act complained of vas done maliciously, justified the lowering of the road under the authority of the local board of health appointed under tb e Public Health Act (the llth and 12th of Victoria chap. 63). This plea was demurred to.
Mr. Lcsi, in sopport of the demurrer, contended that the plea was bad. The board had no power to lower the road withott making access to the road commodious to the plaintiff and his tenants. The learned counsel cited the 68th section of the act, which authorized the local board to alter, raise, or lower the soil of streets " as they may think fit."
Lord CAMiPE1 LL inquired whether there was any clause which gave compensation for what was done under the act I
Mr. Lusu said, there was not.
Lord CUIIPBELL said, he recollected a case (" Bolton v. Crowther," 2 B. C., 703) where trustees, under a turnpike act, had raised a road and ebstrueted the plaintiff's entrance, it was held that the trustees were not liable.
AIr. Lusts contended that it ought to have been alleged that the defendant was unable to make access to the road easy to the plaintiff.
Mir. Phi pson appeared in supportof the plea, but he was not called upon,
Lord CAiIPBELL.-The learned counsel had said all that could be said for the plaintiff, but he had said nothing to show that the plaintiff could recover. The case in " Barnewell and Cresswell" showed that private inconvenience must yield to the pubhc conrenience. It was to be regretted that the Legislature had not provided for compensation where an injury was done to private property. But Parliament was omnipotent, and if it had given the right to lower the road without making compensation this Couirt had no rightto say that that should not be done.
The other judges concurred.
Judgment for the defendant.
I)Av1SoN V. DUNCAN .LND %NOTE[PR.
This case caine before the Court upon a demurrer to the defendants' plea.
Mr. MAXNISTY, in support of the demurrer, stated that the action was brought to recover damages for a libel published by the defendants respecting the plaintiff in the Durne
CountyAdvertisr. Theartdein questiouwasheaded "'WeAt Hartlepool Improvement Comuissitoners," and purported to be a report of certain proceedings and& discursion which had taken place at such meeting respecting a license alleged to .have been granted by the Bishop of Durbam (Dr. Maltby) to a Bev. J. M Burges to act as chaplain to the cemetery. The learned counsal read the report, which sbowed that the discussion was of an angry and abusive character. Several of the counmissioners alUegedthatthe
lien s " eluny devioe on thb prt df Mr. Joeepis Davison (the plainfiff), and that it ws disoovered by the bishop." Another commissioner said, "it would appear that thewholeproceeding was. afraud upon the bishop as wellas uoo the public." Another said, "It ws great scandal upon the church;" while a third said, "I dornt see that. it is,in my opinion, rnerelya scandal upon xr. Joeeph Davison, the ltebiahop's secretary" (meaning the plaintiff). At the closof the discussion the commissioners resolved unanimously-" That the commissioners do not admit the necessity of any euch document, and, being now informed that the biahop himself repudiates it, decline to recognize its validity. To this declaration the defendants pleaded that the said meeting of the said Hartlepool Improvement Commissioners in the said libel mentioned waa held as therein stated, and the same was a public meeting of the commissioners, acting under the powers of the West Hartlepoolimprovement Act, 1854, and was held for the purpose of putting that act into execution. It then allegod in substance that the aticle complained of was a just, true, faithful, correct, and accurate report of the proceedings which took place at the said meeting, and that there was no malice on the defendantW part in printing or publishing the same. To this plea the plaintiff demurred, and thus raised the question whether the defendants were justified i publishing a true and faithful report of the defansatory speeches spoken at the meeting of the said West Hartlepool Commissioners.
Lord CAMPBELL said, the plea would formerly have been held bad on specil demurrer, as amounting to the general issue.
Mr. MkNIsTy said,-The plaintiff alleged that the charges were false, and that the question was whether newspapers were to be at liberty to publish false statements muade at such meetings. The case was not like that of a report of proceedings in a court of justice, where the parties were
resent. Tbe plaintiff aleged that the libel was false from ginning to end. The speakers took the opportunity of making statements which were not founded in fact.
Lord CA.MPBELL said, the plea denied that the defendants had any malice.
Mr. MANISTY said that was so; but the question was whether it was open to newspapers to publsh reports of speeches made at such meetings.
Lord CAMrPBELL.-Was this a meeting at which the public had a right to be present? A good dea might depMnd on that.
Mr. MAIsrTy said the public had no right to be present; the act was only a loca improvement act. It was an act fer paving, lightmg, watching, draining, cleansing, regulating, and otherwise improving the town of West HArtlepool, &c., and for providing a cemetery, and for other purposes. It appointed commissioners whom it incorporated, with power to make rates for carrying out the act.
Lord C&MTBXLL said that, as the commissioners had ower to do acts and to levy rates, all the inhabitants of 'West Hlartlepool would have a right to be present. For what purpose were they assembled when the debate arose ?
Mr. MArtISTy said it did not appea. The plea merely said there was a mneeting of the commissioners actinm under the powers of the ct, and for the purpose of putting the act iexecution. The learned counsel proceeded to contend that, though the Courts had alowed reports of proceedings in courts of justice where the proceedin s were not ex parte, the law bad neTer been extnded to cases yike the present. The cases were all collected in the case of "H Hoare v. Silverlock" (9 C. B., 20), in which it was held that in an action for libel it was a good defence that the article complained of was a fair report of a proceeding in a comut of justice, the proceediag not being cx parte. MIr. Justice Maule said, " think it is impossible to say that a fair account of proceedings in a court of justice not being ex part-e, but in the hearing of both sides, is not, generally speaking, a justifiable publcation. Matters nay appear in a court of justice, that may have so immoral a tendency, or be so injurious to the character of an individual, that their publication could not bh tolerated. But, as a general rule, it may be assumed that the publication of a fair account of what passes in a court of justice not expartc is jrustifiable, unless there is something to take it out of that eulc."
Mr. U.NTHxy, who appeared in support of the plea, said the question now was whether a fair report of what took place at a meeting of commisioners, and without malice, was a prvileged communication.
Lord C.UMPBXLL said that nearly 10 years ago it was pro. posed to the Legislature to pass an act to render that lawful wicnh was not so before; but it did not extend to public meetings. His Lordship spoke in a very low tone of voice, but we understood his Loroship to refer to this circumstance to show that the distinguished persons who had considered the subject did not consider that the privilege extended to reports of public uectings.
Mr. Justice WIGBtAN said,-Suppose the case of a publc meeting on the subject of the income-tax, and some very strong observations made?
Mr. JUrlnwii said a public meeting would have no power over such a question.
Lord CAMPBELL laughed, and appeared to signify dissent from that proposition.
lMr. Justice WIGIvAt..-Suppose the editor said he published a correct report of what passed ?
Mr. Justice CRo0Taror-Bappose a speaker makes some strong observations upon a collector?
Lord CAmprsm -.or that the Chancellor is charged with robbing the Exchequer, and that thereby the necessity for the iucome-tax anises? (,aughter.)
Mr. UN-nLtNx contended there was a difference between that case and the present, where commissioners were appointed by act of Parliament who had the power to tax the subject to the extent of 2s. 6d. in the pound on al property rated to the poor-rate.
Mr.JusticeCnompToo said,-Suppose it had been the case of a railway meeting, how were Her Majesty's subjects beyond Hartlepool interested?
Mr. UNTiLtAN said, the question was one of great importance, as simar bodies were now constituted all over the country. The commissionersin this case had everyconceivable power, including power to construct baths, cemeteries, &c., and to borrow money to the extent of 26,0D01. It was therefore of the highest importance that their meetings should be open to the public, and their proceedings reported in the now apers-s much so as that the proceedings in this court should be reported. It had been decided that an advertisement inserted in a newspaper respecting something lost was not libellous, though it might criminate some one.
Lord C431PBELL.-You are now contending for the right to give a fair and full report of what takes place.
Mr. UM'THANY-Admitted that more might have taken place that was irrelevant.
Lord CAmtPnELL.-We assumo that it was a publc meeting. Do you assert that a fair report of what takes lace in a public meeting may be reported in thenewapapers-
Mr. UrNTH.?- said he did, the same as the proceedings of a police-court or court-martial. All the cases wero brought before the Court in " Stockdale v. HIasard" (9 A. B., 97.)
Lord CAUIPBELL intimated that there was no case to support the learned counsel's proposition.
Mr. UxTvsrAmx said that since that case was decided these local authorities had been established all over the country.
Lord CAMPBELL.-Then all that takes place in a vestry meeting may be published? His Lordship here referred to the case of Lord Abingdon, who made a speech against his steward, and afterwards maliciously pnUAiLmed thelbe.
Mr. Justice WiGH TSa.-You must assume that the speaker speaks maliciously, and that the reporter states what passed.
Mr. U.T5iA.e1C said that would apply to what took place in a court of justice.
Mr. Justice CROIMPTOX said the question was whether the privilege was to be extended-whether a reporter might pubish every inflammatory charge
Lord CA.MPBELL.-There is a didiculty in deciding what is done bond fide and what maliciously.
Mr. \livrst-Tbat would apply to a report of a proceeding in a court of justice.
Lord CAMPB_L.-B.t that is in the presence of the judges, and they are answered by the other side.
After a short conference with the other judges,
Lord CAsiPBELL said he was of opinion that, as the law now stood, the plea was bad. As the law now stood, a fair account of what took place in a court of justice was privilegedl,if made bondfide. The public had great interest in knowing what tookplace in courts-of justice, and what passed therewasunder the controlofthe judges, audtheinconvemience which arose from allowing that privilege was infinitesimally small compared with the benefit which was conferred upon the public. lut when an attem t was made by the Legislature to extend that privilege it had faied, and till now in a court of justice the doctrine had never been contendedfor. It might be desirable that the doctrine should be extended, but without some guarantees for tho protection of private character he (Lord Campbell) thonight such publications ought not to be permitted. If the plea were good, a fair account might be published of what took place at a public meeting, whatever injury it might do to private character, from a meeting of the county down to a meeting of a towncouncil-a meeting to levy a rate, or for the removal of a pauper. At such meetings there might be a great number of things said extremely injurious to private character, and if such a plea as the present were a defence there would be no opportunity for the party to vindicate his character from the aspersions cast upon it. If the Legislature saw fit, it might extend the privilege to certin meetings under certain qualifications. But the Court had to ecide according to the law as it now stood, and he (Lord Campbel) felt bound to giVe judgment for the plaintiff.
Mr. Justice COLSIiDGE and Mr. Justice W`cGsXAN expressed themselves to the same effect, and
Mr. J ustice UROXPTOq said he was entirely of the same opinion for the same reasons.
Judgment for the plaintiff.
ARGENT V. BEYMALL.
MIr. J. NEALE (vwith whom was Mr. Cook Evans) moved for a role to show cause why the verdict found for the plaintiff for 301. odd should not be set aside and a new tiial granted on thie ground of misdirection, and that the verdict was against the evidence. The cause was tried before Mr. Justice Crompton At the last sittings at GuildhaUl, wvhen it appeared that the plaintiff on the 31st of July, 1854, was tho barmaid of a Mr. Hare, who kept a tavern called the Canterbury Arms, at Woolwich. On that day Hate executed a bill of sale of all his furniture, leoe, to two editors, and the defendant was induced to become trustee under that deed. An agreement was then drawn up betweeu the plaintiff and defendant, that the plintiff should become the defendant's servant at 16L a-year wages, i: being at the same time verbaUy agreed that she should receive her wages from her mnaster at the end of the first year. The plaintiff went to Loicester, as she said, for the benefit of her health; but, according to the evidence given by the defendant's witnesses, she left to take another situation at LAiceeter, leaving the bBi of salo which sh ewas intrusted with by the defendant in Hare's possession. In about five weeks she returned, and was allowed by Haro to resume her place. At the end of the next year her master was obliged to give up the business. The plaintiff then
claimed her avges, and, according to her own statement, she had received nothig for her services since July, 1854, w.hen the bill of Sale ws executed;
thougha, according to the defendant's witnesses, she in October, 1856, admitted that only 151. or 16. wvas due. Thelearnedcounsel contended that thelearned judge had uot correctly directed the jury on facts as they were proved,

Mr. Serjeant Shee and lr. ]rentih e were counsel for the Plaintiff, and Mr. B:uddleston for the defendant.
The declaration in this case stated that the defendant had placed a certain iron grating or hurde on a public highwav which fell upon the plaintileand inflic tserious *t upon him, oeros indun y
The plaintiff was a chila, only six years of age, and brought this action by his father to recover damages for a very serious injury which he had received through the allege neglgence of the defendant. The plaintiff's father was a porter in a glass merchantVs warehouse in Holbornb , and the defendamnt who was n a blacksmith in Kingsb gate-street, Holborn, ka was inx the habit of hanging9 iron articles outside his sbop, and as the plaintiz was walking along the pavement a iron gnrting or hurdle, which was standin up against the house, fen down uson the chid and knoc edit down. The child was picked up in a state of insensbilty, and was taken to King's Colege Hospital, where it continued insensible for three weeks ; at the expiration of that time it opened its eyes and an tn-
rovement commenceld. It was soon after nmoved to its home, but was stil an out-patient of the hospital. Before the acident it was s healthy good-tempered child, but it was now fretful and always complaining of pain in its bead, and the medical men were of opinion that a broken bone was pressing upon tsome portion of the interior of the head and that in the course of time an opration musth be per. formed and that portion of hone rea oeinot.
This was the case as proved by the plaintiff's onessea.
The defence was that the accident waT occasifhed by the conduct of the child. The defendant's witnesses tated that the grating wts standing on the ground leaning aainstm the defendant's shop; many children v ere pluaying the, and the plaintiff climbed up on the tin andwas tng to rook it; another child crept in behi h te grating, w hic
caused it to fal forwards, and the plaintiff being upon the grating fell under it.
The defenrdant trnAted that the grating had been ofsced there for somne persons to take away in half an hour; iLt was finn. Children were a nutsance in the street, They were an aadacios lot of chidren, and when spoken to they put their fngers to their noses. He mnight have done the same when h was young. Chuidren would aswing when they could.
On behaf of the plaintiff it was urged that the defendant'
knowing that chaidren were in the habit of playing near his shop, should not have oblated this gaeting in the children's
lay td,for Lord tenman hsr said that the chldren of
neon a right to play in the streets, otherwise where were theynto play?
Mr. Justice fare, in summing up the case to the jury, said they were to decide whether the defendant's misconduct wa the cause of the accdent-wan he guity of negligence b
He had a good deal of doubt as to the question whether the defendant wa guilty of any negligence-it was matter entrely for the jury to mesure. If they beeieved the witnesses on the pat of the plaintiff, an article of a danterous nature was placede aginst the wall of a thronged pub ic thoroughfare, and so plaed, that by the vibration occa-l sioned by a blacksmiths hammer, it would be likely to fall. If that was a true description of the placing of the article by the defendant there wa corninderable negligence, hut, toen, there had been a aiff,erent escription given by other witkesses, that the article was placed at the bottom, two feet from the walL If they were of opinion that it was placed at that inclination, it was for them to say whether there had been any degree of danger to the ubl right of afSihenghalong that ro an that a considerable force would berequired to move it, then it would be for them to say whether there was any negli o ant f care in lIng

Mr. Bovill and Mr. T. Jones having been heard in support of the rule,
The CouRT gave judgment in favour of the defendants, it being their opinion that the defendants were not liable as common carriers, inasmuch as they did not profess to carry over the branch line in question, nor was there any evidence of any special contract binding on them to receive and carry goods for the plaintiffi

IAlNCOCK V. TEMPEST.
This was an action for goods sold and delivered and money due upon account stated. The defendant pleaded, first, "never indebted," and then "infancy." The plaintiff in his replication stated that the goods supplied were necessaries.
Mr. Edwin James and Mr. Symon appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Bovill and Mr. Maude for the defendant.
Mr. Jxsss,in opening the case onthepartof theplaintiff, said, that gentleman was woll known as a highly respectable tradesman and dealer in valuable jewelry, carrying on business in Bond-street. The defendant (Lord Emest Vane Tempest) was the youngest son of the late Marquis of Londonderry, and the action was brought to recover a6 sum of 1501. 19s. for jewelry, to which he would have to direct thc particular attention of the jury, supplied to the defendant during a period extending from Soptember 1, 1854, down to May 11, 1855. The articles sold were selected from time to time by the defendant, and it would be as well to observe that each article had its price marked upon it in plain figures, so that persons might know what they were buying. The defendant, being an officer In the 2d Life Guards, and the son of one of the wealthiest and most arlstocratic families in England, moved in a very high sphere of society, and was entitled by his rank to those attributes of luxuy and vealth which were commonly used by persons in his position in life. The plaintiff, a west-end tradesman, was in this position,-a young nobleman had come to his shop and had from time to time selected certain articles, none of which were at all extravagant for a person in the defendant's position, and then, when the latter was asked to pay, ho thought it honomrable to put upon the record a plea of infancy. Howover, an infant was liable for necessaries, and the question for their consideration, under his Lordship's direction, wnuld be whether the articles supplied were necessary to the position and rank of the defendaut7 In Addison's Treatise upon tke Lazo of Contracts, vol. i, pa.e 172, it was laid down that certain classes of things were absolutely necessary to all manner of men, such as food, clothing, lodging, and education, but the description of the necessaries would vary according to the circumstances and condition in life of the individual. " ^.servaut in livery may be allowed to a rich infant, because such attendance is comlmonly appropriated to persons in his rank in life. Therefore it has been holden that expenAive uniforms are necessary for infant officers in tbe Guards who have large expectations upon coming of age All such articles as are purely ornamental are not necessaries; and for such things the infant could not be made responsible. But if they are not strictly of this description, then the question arises, whether they were bought for the necessary use of the party in order to support himself properly in the degree, state, and station of life in which he moved; if they were, the infant masy be nade responsible." Noow was the plaintiffs bill of 1501. i9s., incurred during a period c-f tvwo years, at all extravagant for a joung nobleman in the Life Guar-ds ? The whole of the articles were disputed, not a farthing had been paid into courtzi although it would be clearly proved that most of the articles were such as milht fairly be supplied by the plaintiff as requisite for the delOndant to maintain himself iu his proner positio The firast article in the plaintiff's biU was a aiancl and rub
ring. which article it had been decided was a necessary for a nobleman. The next thin was m atn a nelled hair-lorket
Mir. Baron BRiA.MWELL.-What is that for, Mlr. James?
Mr. JAIES.-It is what You put a piece of hair ia when you are attached to a young lady.
Mr. Baron BtAbnvELL.-Then all that I can say is that I have been without necessaties all my life.
Mr. JAsrES.-Your Lordship was never an officer in the Life Guards.
The learned counsel then went on to say that the next artcles in the biU were a pair of onyx sleeve links,, 3,, and a set of gold studs, 2l-was it to be said that theseere DXtravapant or unnecesary articles? Let the jury just fancy Lord Ernest Vane Tempest with Fewter studs or even jet ones at 2d. or 3d. per sot, as hothlr. Edwin James) and th ury weire obliged so weaxr-just let them fancy him riding
fectly absurd s The next item was a gold latchdoor key. It was a piece of ptide among the officers in that regiment to have tneir latchdoor keys made of gold, a,,d nearly every one of themf po0s8seserd otn,e of this meal lathke wouldhis ammasay f th hea d ta ehdalthl
of steel or iron instead of gold, as the others had ? Why, he was surrounded by persons of great wealth, and he must do as they did, and fro,u his position such things became absolutte nhecessarie. Then there was a gold turquoise Alma locket-that was to put somebody else's hair in most likely, or to give to one of his famiiily in remembrance of that bale. Then came an enamelled pearl chain necklace, 71. 7s. That he could not wear outside his cravat at aU events. However he had it. Then came an article which he scarcely thought could be disputed-a Russian leather dressing-roll, without the razors, although it might be said that the defendant did requiire shaving. Then there was repairing his gold Geneva watch. Surely he was entitled to a watch, even if it were only that he might know when be was goimg too fast. The facts as he had stated them would be proved by the witnesses whom he would call, and he trusted the jury would say that the articles supplied to the defendant were only suitable to his
Mr. Hancock, the jeweUer, said he carried on business in Brton-street, Bond-street. He knew the defendant, who was the third son of the late Marquis of Londonderry and an officer in the 2d Life Guards. fn 1854 and 1855 the defendant was accustomed to come to his shop and make perchases. Those purchases were those named in his bill. He had never aetualy sold him anything himself ; tho defendant had been served by his young men. All the articles in the shop were marked with their price. He knew who the defendant was when he was giving him this credit. The family had dealt with him for many years. It was a very large family. He recoUected the diamond and ruby ring perrectly; it was a gentleman's ring. All the articles in his shop were numbered, so that he could teU any article by looking at its number. Hle made many lockets for gentlemen to wear. They were worn next the heart a good deaL Lord Adolphus Tempest was at Alma, and he thought the lock I vas made in consequence of that.
Cross-eimined.-He was in the habit of sending his assistants to the barracks with anything which might have been ordered. He usualy sent his bill to the Marquis of Londonderry every Christmas. He had not included in his Christmas bill of 1854 the iten s of the present account, nor in the bill of Christmas 1855. It was not usual to send in the officers' bills to their mamasna. He bad sent the Present bill to Lady Londonderry somewhere about the middle of 1856. That was in consequence of hearing the defendant was going to the Crimea. It was after the difficulties in which
ort Ernuest Vane Tempest became involved.
Re-examined.-He had had a conversation with her Ladyship, in which she said she was very sorry he had given her son credit, and since that time he had not given him any further credit.
Some other witnesses were called and examined to prove the delivery of the articles, but one of the assistants being in Egypt the delivery of only 651. 15s. worth of goods could be strictly proved.
At the conclusion of the plaintiff's case,
Mlr. BOVILL said, that this case hadbeen defended on the part of the defendant's family. A check for 601. had been offered to settle the action, and had been refused.
Mr. EDWLN J,tIgS denied the fact of 601. having been offered, and said that even if it had been he should have objected to compromise the case. Every article had been disputed. Lady Londr-nderry had offered 5s. in the Pound for her son's debt, which had been refused. Why did they not caU Lord Ernest Vane Tempest to prove that he had not had the guods if they wished to dispute that fact ? If, however, his Lordship ruled that in strict law Mr. Han. cock had only proved the delivery of 61. 15s. worth of goods, why, of course, the latter must take a verdict for that amount only.
lis LORL'SIIIP tben told the jury that the plaintiff had only given evidence in point of law of the delivery of goods amounting to 651. 15s. The defendant had made no defence, and therefore their verdict would be for that sum.
The Jury returned a verdict for 651. 15s. accordingly, but expressed their strong opinion that the plaintiff ought to have been paid the whole of his demand.
DISBOROUGH V. MrDCLEY.
This was an action brought to recover compensation in damages for an alleged breach of promise of marriage. The defendant pleaded, "Not Guilty."
Mr. Serjeant Thomas and Mr. Charnock appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Edwin James for the defendant.
It appeared from the case as opened by the plaintiff's counsel, that the defendant was a publican, keeping a respectable publichouse in Spitalfields. The plaintiff was a young woman who left her father's house at Wallington three years ago, at which time she was 1S years of age. Soon after she came to Londonshe went into the service of a person named Holmes, who was also a publican, and in whose employ the defendant was at that time as barman. In November, 1855 the plaintiff left Holmes' employ, and shortly after. wards she was delivered of a child, of which Holmes wa5 the father. She was unable to bring an action aeainst Holmes for the seduction, as she was the servant of the person who would haTe been the defendant, and therefore no such action would lie. She, however, brought an action against him for the assaults he had committed upon her, and she recovered a verdict, with 201. damages, having previously failed in affiliating the child upon Holmes. The present de. fendant, who had been called as a witness on that trial, had paid his addresses to the plaintiff during the period she was in Holmes's employment, but on finding the conditi on she was in she refused to have anything more to do with him. Subsequently to her confinement, however, he renewed his proposals of marriage, which she accepted. In the following February, however, he wrote her a letter stating that he should have nothing more to do with her, and since that period he had married another person.
The following evidence was then called in support of the plaintiWs case -
Eliza Disborough.-I am in service. The plaintiff is my sister. We came from Wallington about three years ago. We both went into situations. At the trial which took plaoe in November last Mr. Holmes was the defendant. The present defendant was called as a witness. These letters were put into his hands, and he awknowledged them to be in his handwriting. When those letters were received by my sister she was in her confinement. I had visited my sister while she was in the service of Holmes. The defendant was also in his service. My sister waa confined on the 7th of December, 1855. I went on the following day to Midgley's house. I wished to know from Midgley where Mr. Holmes was. I told the defendant of my sister's position. He said he was very sorry for her, but he could not look upon her with the same respect as if it had not occurred, but he might have known it from what she had told him. I mentioned to him that my sister told me Holmes had wished her to make the child's father either Mid ley or David, who were the two barmen. Midgley saidte had too much respect to offer her such a thing. He seemed very much distressed. He put his head upon the table and cried. He asked if he could come and see her. I told him he might if he hked. He did come on the following Sunday. I admitted him upstairs. When he came into the room he could not ask my sister how she was because he was so much moved he be an to cry. He remained there above an hour. After he had been there some time he sent for a bottle of wine, and when he went away he left a sovereign for my sister. He sent several letters after that whic h my sister answered. A fortnight or three weeks after he called again. My sister then told him she should take a situation as a wet nurse. He objected to her going out as a wet nurse, as it would unfit her for being a publican's wife. le also told her not to father the child upon Holmes, as that person had set him up in business, and he would not like to see her there if she did so. He also said that his intention was to make her his wife as soon as he got into business for himself. He said it might be a year and a-half before he should be able to make her his wife, and he would do what he could for her to enable her to keep the child. He left another sovereign upon that occasion. About a week after lie called again and he took her to the theatre. He brought a cab for her. He again expressed his intention of marrying her, and called her "Mrs. Midgley." He called me "sister." He brought her back. He called once after that-about a fortnight after taking her to the theatre. He gave her nothing the last time he came, but he had given her 30s. when he took her to the theatre to buy herself a silk dress. My sister has got the dressing-case he gave her. Upon the trial he stated that he had wished to court my sister, and also that he had since married. He further stated that his business was his own. Mty sister was much attached to him.
Cross-examined.-My sister went to affiliate the child upon Holmes in February, 1856, and failed in doing so. The action was brought in March against Holmes. The second attempt to affiliate the child was in last December. My sister told me when she was at Holmes's house, knowing how she was, she objected to keep on the correspondence with Midgley. The child is alive now; it is a girl. The defendant was with Holmes as barman. I asked the defendant to call upon my sister. Upon both occasions when he called upon my sister he cried a great deal. The defendant is about 26 years of age, and my sister is 22. He said he should not like her to take any step to affiliate the child upon H[olmes. My sister had spoken to the doctor, who tried to get her a situation as wetnurse until Midgley objected to it.
Re-examined.-Midgley has said that he destroyedl my sister's letters. Mrs. hamp, at whose house my sister was confined, advised her to keep the defendant's letters. My sister has obtained a situation since her confinement.
Mrs. Champsaid, she had let a room to the plaintiff in November, 1855. The defendant had called there to see the plaintiff.
John Austin said, the defendant carried on his business in Brick-lane, Spitalfields. His house was a very decent publichouse.
The defendant's letters to the plaintiff were put in and read. They were written in a very affectionate tone, and were generallY signed " Your lover; " and they stated his intention of marryiNg the plaintiff as soon as he was in a position to do so.
Mr. Serjeant THO%IAS summed up the plaintiff's case.
Mr. EDWIN JAMES, in addressing the jury on the part of the defendant, admitted that the verdict must be in favour of the plaintiff, but he contended that the smallest amount of damages was all that she waa entitled to. It was perfectly true that the-Jfendant had promaised to marry the plaintiff, but he had 'leeken that promise in consequence of her act. He had requested her not to affliate the child upon his master Holmes, and she, in defiance of that prohibition, had made the whole affair public, not only by endeavouring to affiliate the child but also by bringing an action against Holmes in a public court of justice. It could not be ex-
pected after the plaintiff had made her shame publc that the defendant would carry out his cntract- Under these circumstances, he trusted that the smallest amount of damages the jury could give would, in their opinion, fully compensate the plaintiff for the injury she had sustained.
Mr. Baron BRAM WEI,L, in summing up, said he mnst say that in his opinion the defendant had acted in the first instanc in a very kind and proper manner. The jury inust judge of his reasons for breakmg his promise, and must give such damages to the p laintiff as chey onsidered wvould compensate her for the difference in her present position and the position she would have held as tho defendant's wife. He considered that the fact of her having had a child would rather increase than diminiih the amnouns of the damages, because she would be much less likely now to become the
wife of a respectable tradesman, wvhich she might have become if it had not been for that circumstance.
The jury retired, and on returning found a verdict for the plaintiff-damages 301.
The Court did not rise until nearly half-past 5 o'clock,

IN RE THE GOODS OF MR. H. P. COLLETT.
(Before Sir JoILi DODso;.)
Mur. i. a . 0ollett, late of Yately-hall, in the county of Southampton, died on the 27th of March, 1855, leaving behind him a widow and four minor children. By profession be was a solicitor, and had prepared his own will, dated the 27th of July, 1854, in which he appointed his wife executrix in the following words:-" I do hereby nominate and appoint my said dear wife, Mary Ann Collett, to be executrix of this my will during her widowhood, and so long as she shall continue unmarried." By the wiU he gave to his wife and her executors his plate, pictures, carriages, and other effects at Yately-hall. Ie then demised and bequeathed to three trustees all his real and personal estate, to permit his wife to enjoy the residence and grounds of Yately-hall provided she continued a widow, with nower to the trustees, "with the consent of his wife in writing." to convert into money any part of his real and personal estate. He directed the residue of his real and personal estate to be held by the trustees to pay his debts, funeral and testamentary expenses, and an annuity of 1,0001. to his wife during widowhood, whom he appointed guardian of his children. On the 10th May, 1855, probate of the wil was granted to Mrs. Collett during widowhood. She died on the 14th of September last, at Yately-hall, withot having again married, having made her will, and thereof appointed Mr. BL C. Dixon sole executor and universal legatee, and, so far as she was able, guardian of her children. The trustees now prayed probate of the will of Mr. CoUett to be granted to them as executors according to the ter our; but, in the event of the Court not regarding them in that light, then to decree to them letters of adyninistrationl with the wiUl annexed, of the goods of the deceased left unad. ministered, as the residuary legatees in trust, the chain of executorship, as contended, being broken by the wife's death.
The ADRm.kLry ADvocATE appeared on behalf of the trustees, and submitted, first, that they were entitled to be joined as executors before the death of the widow if they had applied to the Court-" Grant v. Leslie" (3 Phil., 116), " Lynch v. BeUew and Another" (3 Phil., 424); " Goods of E. S. Fry" (1 Hagg. Ecol. R., 80), and Willianis on Executors, p. 200. Secondly, that the trustees were now entitled to the executorship, inasmuch as they had not forfeited their right-" Harrison v. Harrison" (4 Notes of Cases), affirmed by the Court of Exchequer in " Venables v. the East India Company" (Williams, p. 234). Thirdly, that the widow had no transmissiblepower-"Bond v. Faikney" (2 Lee, 371).
Dr. BAYFOstD, on behalf of Mr. Dixon. contended that in the case of " Bond v. Eaikney" Sir G. Lee assumed that if the wife of the deceased had remained a widow until her death the chain of executorship would have been continued by her will. In the present case the trustees could not, according to the terms of the will, do any act without the consent of Mr Collett in writing, whetber she married again or not; consequently they were controlled. That constituted an entirely distmit case from where persons had property put in their hands to pay all debts, funeral and testamentary expenses. If the trustees had come before the Court and asked for probate jointly with the wife it would not have granted it, inasmuch as they did not stand in the same unfettered position as she; nor could they procure it at any future period, particularly as the condition in which she held the executorship was unbroken, and she remained executrix to the time of her death. The usual rule, therefore, applied, that she being the executrix, and having left an executor, he represented the ori&inal testator.
The learned JuDGE said that, in his opinion, the cases which had been cited showed that the trustees were to be considered executors according to the tenour. Dr. Bayford bad caUed the attention of the Court to the fact that they could not sell any part of the real and personal estate without the consent of the widow, but that made no difference. If they had been appointed e.xecutors in direct terms, still there might have been a clause of the same description. He therefore decreed probate to the three gentlemen named as executors according to the tenour, and consequently refused the prsayer of Mfr. Dixon, the executor to the wife, but he would decree that gentleman his costs.
SDISON V. ROSS AND CLXTOW.
This was a business of granting probate of the last will and testament of 31r. Thomas Simson, late of Ely, promoted by Mr. Joseph Simson, the brother, and one of the executors named m the will, bearing date the 17th of February, 1854, against Mrs. SusannahP Ross, formerly Butler, the niece, and a legatee named in the codicil, dated the 15th of May 1854 Mr. Claxton, also an executor appointed both by tho will and codicil, was subsequently cited before the Court, and then propounded the latter. The testamentry papers having been thus brought before the Court, an allegation was given in on the part of Mr. Joseph Simson i
support of the will, but adverse to the codicil, in which it was pleaded that the deceased died on the 27th of August, 1854, having carried on the business of a miler and baker, jointly with his brother; that he was possessed of real estate of the value of 2,5201., and of personalty amounting to about 3,0001.; that the deceased and his brother had the most entire confidence ill and affection for each other, and never divided the profits of their business ; that the deceased frequently expressed his obligation to his brother for taking the active management of the business, saying that he was indebted to him for all he was worth, and that he would leave it to him at his death, in accordance with which he exectedwUl inhisfavour in 1825 and 1842; that fromi ehildhood to August, 1849, the brothers resided together in
the same house, and from 1843 the niece, Mrs. Ross, being then 12 years of age, lived with them; that in 1849 Mr. Joseph Simson married, but he and his brother stil kept one common purse, and the deceased showed much kindness to his brother's children - that about February the 15th,
854, the deceased had a ahight paralytic attack in his right arm and leg, two days after which he executed the will now propounded, being at the time in perfect possessio^. of his mental faculties ; but about six afterwards he was attacked with epilepsy, of which there were several subsequent attacks, the coonsequence of which was to reduce him to a state of imbecilty; that his memory entirely failed him, and he would inquire after people whom he had previously known to be dead; that those about him, and particularly Mrs. Ross, acquired over him a complete influence, and could get him to do almost anything they chose; that in May, 1854, Mr. J. Shnson taxed MErs. Ross with inducing the deceased to leave her a sum of money, and threatened to dispute his capacity, to which Mrs. Poss rep lied that she hoped he would not do so about the trifle she had made the deceased leave her that after the death of the deceased Mr J. Simson upbraided his niece on her conduct in making him leave her such a large sum as 3,0001., to which she answered she did not consider it a large smm out of aU his property, for he bad told her several times when he was ill that he was worth 20,000 *; and that on another ocecasion she said she would not have made her uncle leave her the money only she was persuaded to it by other people, who told her, if they were in her place, they would make her uncle leave her something handsome. A responsive allegation was given in on the part of Mr. Claxton, in which it was pleaded that before April, 1854, the deceased had so greatly reoovered from the paralytio attack of February that he had partially resumed the mn e
ent of the baker's business; that in April and May he received money at different times from his customers and paid debts incurred; that he transacted miatters of moment and concern in a careful and correct manner; that he talked and discoursed with many of his neightours rationally and sensibly; that in March he voted for members of the local board of health and for guardians of the poor; that Mr. Claxton being appointed collector to the guardians of the Ely Union, he was required to enter into a bond, and the deceased became one of his sureties, his brother, being one of the attesting witnesses to his signature; that on Mr. Joseph Siimson being informed, in April, 1854, that the deceased was about to make an alteration in his will he became very anxious about the nature and amount of such alteration ; and that, after the codicil was executed, thededeased desireld the father of the solicitor by whom it was drawn] to tell his son not to disclose its contents to Mr. Joseph Simsona.
Dr. BAYFORD, o n behalf of Mr. Claxton, in support of the codicil, submitted that if over there was a case in which the deceased was proved to be of capacity to do the act before the Court this was one. The acts of M1r. Joseph Simison were directly in the teeth of his plea. He treated his brother as a person fully competent to the performance of business. When informed that he was about to make an alteration in his will he did not allege that he was insane, and therefore incapable of doing it, but was only anxious as to the extent to which he was to be injured by it. He (Dr. Bayford) therefore prayed the Court to pronounce for the codicil, and to condemn Mr. Joseph Simsoon in the costs of the proceedings.
Dr. DEANE appeared on the part of Mrs. Ross, who he said was the original party brought before the Court, the executor not then appearin
The learned JUDGE saia that Dr. Deane had a right to appear and watch the proceedings, and, if the executor negected his duty, to interpose and supply the deficen
otherwise it was the practice of the Court to hear counsel for the executor only, presuming that he would do his duty. By this rule there was a great savig of expense In other courts all the parties sometimes appeared b
counsel, aud the consequence was that 19 or 20 counsel were heard, which led to endless expense.
Dr. JENNER (with whom was Dr. Twiss) appeared on behalf of Mr. Joseph Simson in opposition to the codicl, and said, the first thing which naturally struck the mind in reference to it was the amount of property bequeathed by it. It gave no less than 3,0001. to Mrs. Ross out of 5,5001.
the entire property of the deceased. Under the will made in the preceding F ebruary she had no specific legacy at all; 1,0001. was left to her mother, in which she and her rister hada reversionary interest on hermother's death. Thatfact alone would caU for the most stringent proof as to the capacity of the deceased to execute the codicil. The voting for members of the! local board of health and for auardians of
me poor, and the transacting of the matters of business allege, woere not acts which the Court could sayrequired thought, judgment, and refleotion on the part of the de. ceased. A medical man who had known him a considerable time, who lived closed to him, and who saw him two or three times a-day from 1848 to his death, spoke of his incapacity, This was an experiment tried upon the Court, to see with how little evidence in support of a testamentary paper it would be satisfied. If the Court came to the conolusion that the codicil ought to be pronounced for it would not condemn Mr. Joseph Simsonin the costs, buthe (Dr. Jenner) trusted that it would pronounce against the validity of the codicil O
The COURT reserved its judgment.

LIVERPOOL DISTBICT COURT of BANERUPTCY,
Jran,. 23.
EX PARTE TySON. PIT XRPE TVI(V
(Beforc Mr. Commi&qoner PBBY.
On the opening of the; court Mr. Commissioner PERRY said,-This was an application made by Mr. Yates, on behllf of the bankrupt, William Tyson, for the allowance of his certificate, and it was opposed by Mr. Aspinall, as counsel for the assignees. The grounds of the opposition upon which Mr. Aspinall mainly insisted were-1, an a eged fraudulent preterence in favour of a Mr. Wright (farmer), of Crosby ; 2, an alleged fraudulent preference in favour of Mrs. Hilton, to the extent of 3701.; 3, the circumstances connected with a loan from Mr. Humphreys; 4, the borrowing money at an inordinate rate of interest of Mr. Pemberton (his sohictor); and, 5, the omission to keep books of account, with intent to conceal the true state of his affairs. [The learned commissioner did not think the first three objections had been sustained.] I come now (he continued) to the transaction in wbich the bankrupt was engaged with Mr. Pemberton. He has paid to Mi. Pemberton, in interest on loans, 4,0721. 17s. 4d., a sum exceeding the whole of his profits, which are stated at 3,6351. 2s. 10d. The interest so paid was at various rates, gcnerrJly at the rate of 61. per cant. a-month, but there are instanme of charges made of 51. for the loan of 1001. for 12 daN wbich is after the rate of about 150l. per ;ent. ptr annuim and a charge in one case of 21. for the lo,n of 1001 for four days, which is alter the rate of about 1801. per cent. per anuum. Now, no one, Ithink, will befoundto otntendthat sums borrowed at sucb r c'.bitant rates of interest " for the purposcso-bustines. ue nzhe words of the bankrupt, could be expected to yieiu . profit; ancd there will be few, perhaps, who would not at,nnit that a trader who for five years continued to borrow at anything approaching to the rates of interest before mentioned had pursued a most reekless course. Mr. Yates, indeed, calling attention to the fact that Mr. Pemberton had undertaken to repay 1,0001. of the money he had received, and not to prove upon the estate for the 1,5001., or, as Mr. Yates stated it, the 1,7001. due to him, said that would reduce the percentage to about 181. per cent.-a rate of interest paid by many traders in Liverpool. Even thus reduced, a profit could scarcely be calculated upon, so as to relieve the trader from the same charge of recklessness. A case of "Ex parte Butcher" has been referred to, before Mr. Commissioner Goulburn, in which he is said to have treated the borrowing by a bankrupt at large rates of interest for the purposes of trade as a. fraud upon his creditors. I have not the particulars of this case referred to by Mr. Aspinall, but I have no hesitation in saying that a trader who pursues this course, a trader who systematically borrows money at a rate which the profits of his business will not warrant, acts in the most unjustifable mannertowardshis other creditors, and deserves severe censure from this Court. The last head of objection is that of not keeping proper books of account, with intent to conceal the true state of his affairs. As to this head, it is abundantly shown that the books have not been proDerly kept. Thereis the omission of the sum paid to Mr. Wright, of Crosby, and other creditors ofthe like kind * there is the omis. sion to enter the mnoney received from Mr. humphreys ; also the omission to enter the 3701. paid to Mr. Jones ; and, last the omission to refer, anywhere, to the payments to Mr. Pemberton, though alleged to be for business Purposes. It is said, indeed, by Mr. Yates that the bankrxut left the keeping of his books to a clerk, and he might be weU advised in doing so, if he did not understand bookkeeping himself; but then he was bound to furnish the clerk with these particulars, known only to himself, in order that his books might contain a faithful record of his trade and dealings. By not having done so he has laid bimself open to the charge of " concealing the true state of his affairs," and I have heard nothing to satisfy my mind that this was not done advisedly. Considering, therefore, that Mr. Aspinall bas established the fourth and fifth grounds of objec. tion to the bankrupt's certificate, I am of opinion that his certificate should be suspended for two years from this day, and that when granted it sbould be of the second class. One objection being founded on the 266th section the bankrupt will not receive proction, at least fo h
P resent. ln the judgmnent so p renounced I have given their aue wveight to Mtr. Yates's observations as to Mr. Tyson having previously carried on business for a length of time without any com promise, and in good repute among his neighbours.
Insolvent Debtors' Court, Jan. 23.
INSOLYBNT DEBTORS' COURT, Jan. 23.
IN RV. J.MAPmu 1TA-w
(Before Mr. Commissioner MnRrpy.)
This insolvent, a farmer and parish clerk at Hendon, ap. plied under the ProtectionAct. Be was opposed on behalf of a loan society, the holders of a promissory note for 1001., to which his name was attached. The money had been ad. vanced to a MPur. Daniel Harris, the insolvent's nephew since a bankrupt, who upon the last occasion declared the note had been merged in other securities, which he had given to the society. One of the directors of the society to-day proved that no security had been given in substitution of the note im question; but MIr. D. HXarris was called, and stated that, havnng had many transactions with the society during five years, he had paid many sumns, amounting, to upwards of 110I. since this particular note was *iven. T~he note was a renewal and he only received 701. on account
The society complained that all the parties to the note had become bankrupt or insolvent, or had absconded.
Mr. Harris said, that was not the case in one instance. Mr. C. Green, whose name was upon the note, had niot absconded. He was the clerk to the burial board of St. Panoab, and reporter of the Morning Advcertiser and other papers.
MIr. Parmenter, a witness, said that Mr. Green h been an insolvent, and now owed the society 4001.
Mr. DEENN9, on behalf of the insolvent, contended there was no ground to witbhold protection - but
The learned COmmissIoxER thougft the insolvent had done wong in putting his name to a note when he had not the means to meet it. At the same time there were extenuating circumstances, and he had expected to receive 201. or 301. of the money, and was ignorant of the arrears due on account of a former transaction. The case nmust be adjourned sine die, without protection ; but the msolvent might apply in a fortnight for a day to be named to consider the granting of a protecting order.
Police.
POLICE.
MANsIoNs-ousE.-Mhary Lee and Margaret Phi3lips were charged before the LoRD MAYOR with highway robbery, acompanied with violence.
Ange3ina Thomas, a dressmaker, of Whitechapel Eighstreet, said,-On Wednesday morning, about 1 o'clock, I was going along Somerset-street, Aldgate. I had been to the Haymarket Theatre, and was returning home, and the prisoners, who were accom anied by another woman, came
*d me and knocked me down, and, snatching my victorine and cloak from my person, ran away with them. I called out for help, and a woman and a policeman came up. I could not say who it was that struck me. Lee pulled my victorine off and Phillips pulled say cloak off, and they gave them to the other woman, who quickly disappeared. I am quite sure that the prisoners were the persons who robbed mne. I did not know any one of them. They did not speak a word to me. The first thing that happened was a blow in the middle of my back, and that made me fall on my back, and I could see these women well The property I was forcibly robbed of was worth 12. 2s. Gd. I had been drinking a little, but was not very much the worse for liquor. Lee took hold of my arm before I was struck.
Cross-examined by Lee.-I was in the Turk's Head, but I did not ask you to see me home.
Ann Campbell, a servant out of place, said,-I was
passing through Somerset-street, and I saw the prisoners and anotherwomanandthe prosecutrix coming from Aldgate. Lee had got hold of the prosecutrix, and took the nictorine off her neck ; Phillips pulled her cloak off, and Lee struck and knocked the prosecutrix down, and she was not able to rise, and I went and took her up. She was not sober, neither were the prisones. The prosecutSix was very stupid from the effects of drink. They are all strangers to me, and they were making a great noise, which made me notice them.
Two policemen, who took the prisoners into custody, gave evidence corroborative of the statements of the other wntnesses, and one of them said that Lee, upon being apprehended, said that the woman who had got away had got the things, and that another woman made poor girls rob for her,
he prisoners said theyknew nothing at al about any robbery, but they knew that they had been both drunk.
They were committed for trial.
Joseph Fuller, John Biddell, Richard Egan, Peter Dunigan an Edward Wiggins were charged, upon information
ythe Solcitor of the Customs, with having violated the Supplemental Customs Consoldation Act of 1855, by being discovered on board a vessel in which was found a quantitv of smuggled tobacco. The penalty for the offence was stated to be 1001. upon each prisoner, or imprisonment for six mnonths.
W. Nicholson, tide surveyor of the Customs, said,Last night I went on board the Magnet, off Brewer's-quay, and searched her. I found 201b. of foreign manufactured tobacco and cigars over the boiler in the engie-room, Biddell was then in the engne-room, and I told hihn should arrest him, as I had found the tobacco there. He said it was not his. I then directed that the others should be taken into custody.
The aprehension of the other prisoners was then proved. They alt celonged to the engine-room.
chief engineer of the Magnet, said the pSOnerE haa been cballd below when the vessel was in
Harlingen, and the act inflcting the severe penalties upon all parsons who should be found on board when smurged goodsawere discovered in a vessel had been read to them. Thewitness said that he had taken Fuller to work on board from mere charity, knowing that the man was in a state of great destitution, and it was quite impossible that he could have purchased an ounce of tobacco. Another man who had been employed in the engine-room had made his
Thesprisoners solemnly declared that they knew nothing at all of the tobacco, and their belief was that the man who had run away was the person who had thus endangered the vessel and the liberty of all on board. They admitted that they had heard the act read and were aware ofthe conseI quences of its tiolation.
The LOstD MAYose and Alderman RotS, after a strict examination into the circumstances, discharged Fuller, and said they had every reason to believe that the Commissioners of Customs would deal very leniently with the other prisoners upon a representation of the facts which came out by the solicitor. It was, however, their duty to fine each of the prisoners who remained at the bar in the penalty of 100l. each, or imprisonment for six months.
Alderman ROSE.-The object of the section of the act under which these men have been convicted is to protect the revenue and the owners of vessels, and it is therefore incum-
bent upon every one on board to give information of contraband acts or attempts to smuggle
The LORD M)iYOR.-We have no alternative but to convict ani to sentence, and we hope that it will be made known as widely as possible that everybody on board a vessel in which smuggled goods are found is liable to the severe penalty which we have just stated. His Lordship then advised the prisoners to petition the commissioners immediately.
The Solicitor to the Customs said he woald take care to represen tthe circnmstances of the case to the commissioners, together with the recommendation of his Tordbhip and his brother magistrate.
The prisoners were then conveyed to prison.
William Bartlett, aged 13, and John Connor, aged 15, the former of whom had been nime times prosecuted at the Niansion.house for robbery, were found guilty at petty sessions of having stolen some leaden pipes, and sentenecdBartle,t to tbree months' imprisonment and to be privately whipped; and Connor to six weeks' imprisonment.
;GU,DUALL.-Miall Meagher, a respectably-dressed young man, described in the police-sheet as a soldier attached to the Warley Barracks, Brentwood, was charged with obtaining by forged order goods to the value of about 351., with itent to defaud Messrs. Kerr and Scott, whole sale warehousmp?. of C rmon-street west.
TILo prn30ner was remanded.
X p -visTRrT -James Barber, late clerk to Mr. Harris 5 m- ' ! .i t 5elds, solicitor, was brought before Mr. j i on everal charges of forgery and embezzlement. I b * ec-on was conducted by Mr. Wontner.
'Che *m.er was first charged with having embezzled 54
It appeared that in October last the British Exchequer Insurance Company, to whom Mr. Harris was solicitor, purchased from the trustees of St. Thomas Hospital the premises Nos. 156 and 157, Cheapside, for the purpose of establishing their offices there. The assignment was drawn by Messrs. Clayton and Cookson, solicitors to thehospital, and two sums of 18& 14s. and W1. respectively were to be paid to them, the former for the charges of the assignment, the latter for the alienation fine. The prisaner received two checks for the amount stated, from Mr. Colville, secretary to the insurance-offoce, but only paid over to Messrs. Clayton and Cookson the check for 184 14s., telling them that the smaller check waited for an additional surety. He obtained change for this check from Mr. Hatton, solicitor Essex-street, Strand, on the pretence that he wanted petty cash for the office.
The prisoner said he would admit everything. He was very sorry for what he had done, and he would give the prosecution no unnecessary trouble.
He was then charged with stealing a 5.-note, which had been intrsted to him in order to make a tender.
Mr. Hemmings, a wine-merchant, inTalbot-yard, Borough, had on the 5th of December forwarded the note to prosecutor, as his solicitor, to make a tender on his part to a person who had a disputed claim on him. The prisoner was sent to offer the money, which he did, but it was refused, Wben Mr. Harris asked him for the note he said that he milaid it, and from time to time kept up a pretence of looking for it, and not being able to find it Mr. Harris, of course, had to give a check for the amount to his client. He desired the prisoner to stop the note at the Bank, upon which the pnsoner went out as if for that purpose, and on his return said that the note had not been presented and he stopped it. On several subsequent occasions he stated that he had called to inquire, and the note had not yet been presented. At length Mr. Harris
auspicious, and desired his brothertoinveetigate the matter It then turned out that the prisoner had never made an inquires, and that the note, which had never been stouped was presented on the 11th of December. By the endorsements on the note itself it was traced back through several bands to the prisoner, who had paid it away to his grocer
In this case, also, the prisoner admitted his guilt, and was committed.
In the next case MAr. Wontuer observed that there were two distinct forgeries forming part of one transaction. There was also an embezzlement, but he would not ask for a committal on this latter charge, as there wore already two clear cases of that nature.
In December last Mr. Earris was solicitor to the National Provincial Life Insurance Company, since amalgamated with another office, under the title of the Bank of London and National Provincial Insurance Company. Proceedings were taken on behalf of the company to recover the balance of a loan of 1504 from a person named Flanagan or his surety. The prisoner being instructed to negotiate a compromise did so, settling the matter with the surety for 301, and with Flanagan for 404 EHe received the 30L and never accounted for it. This was the embezzlement referred to but in order to obtain possession of the 401. he had to hand over to Flanagan's solicitor, Mr. Mackeson, of Lincoln's-inn a deed of release. Ho produced what appeared to be a genuine document to Mr. MLackeson, who accepted it and nanded him a check for the 401., but it afterwards appeared that the signatures attached to the deed as the names of three of the directors were forgeries. The check being on a country banl, the Dudley and West Bromwich, the prisoner forwarded it to the bankers, requesting them to advise their London agents. so that Mr. Harris might draw on them. This request being complied with, the prisoner drew on the London agents, Messrs. WilUiams, Deacon, and Co.
signig the name of MIr. Harris, received the money, but never accounted for it.
Admitting zhis charge also, he wasfuUy committed forthe forgeries.
it was stated that numerous other charges might be brought forward, but Mr. Harris had selected these as suficient.
In the case of Mr. Smith, landlord of the Marquis of Anglesey publichouse, in Bow-stree4 who was summoned a few weeks back on the charge of having a communication between that and the adjoining house, a beershop, of which he is tenant in fee,
It was stated by Inspector Mitchell that a brick wall had been substituted for the wooden partition in the cellar.
Mr. JARD= thought that was all that conld be required. As to the plate-glass partition between the two bars, he did not think there couldbe av ohbection to that. It was not a communication that could in any way interfere with the purposes either of the police or Excise. He considered Mlr. Smith would be justlied if he had a telegrahic wire or a speakig-pipe betweeen the two houses. Stilt, as the question had not been tried before, the police did quite righ in bringng the matter before this Court for inVestgation.
The summons was then dismissed,
WOnSE P-ST EIIT.-A respectably-dressd elderly man, who gave his name on the charge-sheet as WFalsh, but which IS known to be fictitious, and correctly described himself as a solicitor, was charged before MAr. H rMmr with drunkenness, disorderly conduct, and assaulting an officer of the Eastern Counties Rlailway Company.
Inspector Larter said,-J was at the Bishopsgate station booking-office At 8 last night, when I heard a disturbance at the window. I saw the defendant there * he was intoxicated, and appeared to be having an altercation with the clerk about some change. The clerk told him if he would wait he would examine into the matter, and rectify an mistake, if he had made one. The defendant replied, with an oath? that he would not wait, and on the clerk then teling nu to go away, he reolied "-me if I do till I et my right change. I told him I could not aHow any disturbance there. Many persons were waiting to book, and the disturbance caused by defendant's conduct was so ;reat that theycouldnotreachthebooking-offlce.Defendant'sticket and change were offered to him, buthe would not take them, exclaiming, "You are al a - set of thieves," and I then insisted upon removing him outside. I took him out, and having succeeded, with great difficulty, in pacfy inghim, he promised not to repeat his conduct if I would allow him to return and I did so; but he had no sooner got there again than he behaved wvorse than ever, nearly knocked a lady's bonnet off, and again repeated his bad language. I was therefore obliged totake him into custody when he purposely kicked me backwards, as he stood before me, upon the leg and thigh. I have known him as a passenger by the Ine for a long period,

I begged him to desist, and said I should know when I made up my cash, and would rectify any error, and that he should then see the books, which is our practice, butbhe would not be quiet. I subsequently did make up my accounts, and found an excess of Is. 8d., not 2s.

In the five years ended in 1856 there were 51,093 petitions presented (13,867 last year), and 6,778 printed. Tho number of signatures to these petitions was 8.439,667, and the number of reports made by the select committee 315. The amoant paid for printing and folding reports, appendices, and indices to reports on public petitions, from 1833 to 1852, inclusive, was 23,8811., the average varying from 1,0601 to 1,4631. a-year. The more frequent reports of the oommittee, to meet the wishes of hon. members, increase the expense. In the five years ending 1856 6,6911. was dpaid for printing and folding reports, appendices, and in ices to reports on public petitions, including 1,3401. in the session of 1856. Between 1852.3 and 1856 the total expense of printing and folding amounted to 5,8831. and the expense of paper to 1,8761.; making a grand total of 7,7601. There is a great increase in the pnce

The stores which were brought home from Kertch by the TuCrkish Engineer Corps and landed at Chatham still remain on the Gun-wharf, where they were originally deposited, and unless measures be speedily adopted to protect them from the ravages of the weather there is little doubt that nearly the whole of the stores-sufficient for the equipment of an army of 25,000 men-will be renderedentirely useless, if, indeed, that is not already the case. The whole of the articles, some of which are of a very valuable description, are left exposed to the weather without any kind of protection, excepting that afforded by the coverings of the waggons and the boxes in which they are deposited, and in that condition they have remained during the whole of the winter, and, in fact, since they were brought home at the close of last summer. Among the articles deposited at Chatham are telegraph apparatus with several mUes of wires, all kinds of carpeuters, builders', and miners' tools, harness and saddlery sufficient for several thousand horses, indiarubber boats, tents, and every other requisite for an army in the field. The stores were inspected some months since by General Sir John Burgoyne, Inspector-General of Fortifications, when it was understood that they were to be immediately handed over to the corps of Royal Engineers at Brompton, to be deposited with the other stores belonging to that corps, and kept inx order by the EIDgineer troops; but up to the present time no order has been given to that effect. The men belonging to the engineer corps of the Turkish Contingent, who arranged the stores at Chatham, and were for some time employed in attending to them, have been discharged from that duty.
Our Lisbon correspondent writes, on the 17th, that the Inez de Castro had arrived on the 16th from Glasgow. Her Majesty's ship Princess Royal, after communicating vwith Rear-Admiral Dundas, had entered the Tagus. As she came to anchor too close in shore she grounded, but got afloat again on the fdow-tide. The French ship Austerlitz had anchored just inside the bar. No news had been received of the Royal Mail packet Tamiar. The Durham, which was detained at Lisbon, spoke, Jan. 18, lat. 4133 N., long. t-36 W., the screw steamer Douro, bound south, and, on the 21st, lat. 4S 9 N., long. 712 W., the screw steamer Rattler, also bound south.
The Resolute Arctic exploring ship, stationed at Chat. ham, has had nearly the whole of her internal fittings removed, and yesterday her water tanks were taken out and placed in the dockyard.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I beg to trouble you with a few remarks in reply to MIr. Young's letter in 'Te Times of yesterday. le says that I have made a mistake in stating that " Quebec is closed by ice and other dangers for six months ;" and he goes on to say, "that sailing vessels generally arrive about the 20th of April, and are never away before the 25th of November." These are cerTainly early and( late dates, -which I can state from my own knowledge, having been well acquainted with the Quebec trade for more than 40 years.
I called at Lloyd's to-day to ascertain the rates of insurance at different periods of the year from Quebec; they are as follows:-
Dunng the suminer mlonths, from 25s. to 30s.
September ... .. 40s.-oOs. October .. 50s. - 60S. i N'ovember, five to eight guineass.
This is a fair modte of estimating the ris;s nnd dangers in the St. Lawrence. The underwriters at Lloyd's are good judges in such matters; they are aware of the numerous shipwNrecks that have taken place in the St.Lawrence inNovember. The premium of inaurance from Boston and New York, during the year, is 10s. to 12s. Gd. From these rates some estimate may be formed of the comparative risks and dangers between the two routes. Mr. Young has omitted to point out how the mails, for the lower provinces, are to be transmitted from Quebec. There are no railroads.
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Bermuda would complain if their letters were sent to Quebec, and woulld ask the Government for a separate line for their mails.
I think it will be found that Her Mlajesty's Government, in establishing the present route for the conveyance of the mails, have adopted the best course to meet the interests of all parties. It is impossible to please everybody; the subsidy is paid for the conveyance of the mails, at statel periods, and not for the encouragement of the trade or commerce of any place.
I hope Mr. Young will not be offended at any remarks I have made in which I may difier from him. He is, very laudably, striving to advance the interests of the colony to which he belongs, and in the prosperity of which every Englishman must feel a liveiy interest; but I think he is asking too much to expect that the correspondence with the whole of the United States, Alexico, and the Pacific Ocean, together with the lower provinces, including Bermuda, should be sent to Quebec ; the conseqluence would be that all the correspondence, except for Canada, would be carried by the American mail paclkets, and not by the English. I think it will be generaly admitted that the present arrangement ii better than that proposed by Mr. Young.
Your obedient servant.

Mr. Roebuck, M.P., At Liverpool.
MR. ROBBUCK, M.P., AT LIVBRPOOL.,
On Thursday evening Mr. Roebuck, the member for Sheffield, was present at the annual public meeting of the Liverpool Financial Reform Associatioa, held in the Concert. hall, Lord Nelson-street, which was filled with an attentivo audience. Mr. Lawrence leyworth, MP., was in the chair, and on the platform were some of the influential members of the association.
The Secretary read a letter from Mr. Thomas B. HorsfaU, ALP., declining to support a resolution of which he had receivea a copy, on the ground that there appeared to him to be such a strong feeling in the country-a feeling in which he concurred-against the continuation of the present income-tax.
This announcement was received with hisses and cheers.
Letters of apology for their absence, but expressive of their approval, on tbe whole, of the principles and objects of the association were read from Mr. J. C. Ewart, M.P., Mr. W. Brown, M.P., and Mr. Robertson Gladstone. Mr. Ewart expressed his opinion that he did not think the country was yet prepared to repeal all duties on raw produce and substitute in their stead an equitable property and income tax.
The CHAlIrMA, having complimented the audience for their attendance, declaTed that hitherto fiscal legislation had been a mere matter of accident, left entirely to chance or to the cunning of State-craft trickery, and that they wanted to know what sort of fisal legislation they should have that would be the least injurious to the trade and commerce of the country, and offer the least hinderance to the general accumulation of weealth. He begged their serious attention to what was about to be addressed to them, because he said, from a want of correct information, there was a large body of our countrymen who took offence at the idea of paying a tax immediately out of their pockets, and that tax was the income and property tax. Elie wished no distinction to be made between the rich and the poor, but every man to pay his equal share, and he believed that there was no taxation except direct taxation, such as the income and property tax,which would immediatelyattainthat end. Hewishedto point outthebenefits that had ensued from Sir Robert Peel's adoption of the principle, and hoped that a voice would go forth from that assembly which should be heard in every corner of the country, and that the wrong course men were apt to take on a shallow and superScial view of the subject would be directed and brought back to the only true source of fiscal regulation, which was direct taxation.
The Sect etary having read the report of the operations of the association, which recommended perseverance in the effort to bring to a successful issue the combined objects of financial reform, direct taxation, and perfect freedom of trade,
Mr. Dn-VSoN moved the first resolution, which was-
t- That the benefcial results of the fi-cal changes introduced by the late Sir R. Peel-changes rendered practicable by a partial adoption of the principles of free trade and direct taxation-are evident in the immense development of the resources of the country thereby permitted. auI denionstrate the sound policy of extending the operation of these principles in such a manner as to sectre still greater freedom to commerce, maaufactures, and industry."
Ife pointed out that as the country had now reached the termination of a period of unusual expenditure, some of the existing taxes might be dispensed with, and that they had to decide where the reduction might most fitly be made. He found that 23,000,0001. a-year, or nearly half the annual revenue of the Government, was already raised by direct taxation, and he asked if that policy should be continued? Heillustrated the beneficial results of direct taxation since its adoption in 1842, when the trade of the country was in a very depressed and declining con. dition, and expressed his opinion that the policy was a sound one, and should therefore be continued.
Mr. CBIOSSFIELD briefly seconded the resolution, which was put and carried by acclamation.
Mr. RoYn-ucsK then proceeded to address the meeting, and was received with protracted and deafening applause. Hie said he had accepted the invitation so kindly sent him by the Financial Reform Association of iLiverpool, because he thought by doing so that he should forwardthbegreat end of financial reform,-not because of any vain notion that he himself had any power npon the matter, but because he represeRted the great, and he believed what would be the influential association-the Administrative Reform Association of London. He thought that their views and principles were identical; but he did not bind himself at aU to the principles which might be enunciated by the Financial Reform Association of Liverpool. To put their aims under one head, it was that every one in the community should be taxed according to his means. To this aim he had come down from London to signify his adhesion, and to thank them for aU they had done in the great science of financial reform. He said that they in London did not foresee the coming danger as the Liverpool Association did in 1848; and, therefore, when the storm burst upon them they were unprepared. He then referred to the facts which have so often been commented upon in reference to the condition and efficacy of that army which left our shores for the Crimea, and which he declared was lost by the infirmity of purpose of a Ministry, and not by the a-ms of the enemy. The evil did not arise from transitory causes, they were inherent in the very administration of the country, and it was for the purpose of putting down that mal-administration they had banded together in London. He related how they hod, after two years' labour, discovered that they were on the wrong road, and expressed the honour he felt at being invited to preside at that time over their meetings. He entered into the details of the system theyhad adopted, and stated that they had an organization which would enable them to communicate with ease with every post town in the kingdom. They had endeavoured, and would stiUl further endeavour, to learn all the mischief they had enduredfirst, the mode of taxation itself; niext, its collection* and thirdly, its distribution. In reference to the first, the jiverpool Association had pointed out and endeavoured to teach the people the great advantages of direct taxation ; but, although he agreed with them, there was sonmething to be said upon the subject of direct taxation which he thought was not said. There had been, and there was then, a strong feeling growing up against the injustice of the income-tax. He acknowledged that injustice, and endeavoured in his place in Parliament to ameliorate the mischiefs of that tax. His idea was that a man who had 1001. or 1,0001. a-year from funded or landed property was far more able to pay a tax of 5 or 10 per cent. than the nian who made 1001 or 1,0001. a-vear by his brains or his labour. There weresome political economists, but all very rich men, who thought he was wrong. In the House of Commons he said so; and he recoUected Mr. Gladstone, a man well-known in Liverpool, telling him that his argiunent was not to be answered, but that he must have the money. He showed that in the case of the man with the landed or funded capital it remained, but that in the other case nothing was left. What he proposed to do was to capitalize this 1,_001. a-year, and tax it then as they would tax funded property. Then they would act justly. Or they might take another course, and he pointed out that course in the Hlouse of Commons. They might say to that man, "'We will allow you to insure your life ; you shall lay by so much every year for the purposes of insurance, and we will tax you for the remainder." This would be something like equality between the man of funded and landed property and the man who earns his income by the exercise of his brains and labour. But that was a sort of process not agreeable to those who govern the House of Commons, the powerful majority of whom were uien connected with landed and funded property. He said this claes were wise in their generation, for they excluded fromn the operation of the tax ail nnder 1.501. a-year, thus avoidinggiving offence to the working classes of the country, but the middle classes of it tlsey bound hand and foot, and treated accordingly. He showed how a working man under the present system of taxation contributed a greater portion to the taxes than the rich man, whose consumption of the necessaries of life such as tea and sugar, bore a much smaller proportion to his expenditure than the expenditure of the other. He did not oin in the cry aeainst the income-tax as income-tax, but auainst the injustice of the manner in which it was levied. With regard to the collection of the taxes, every man must know that the mode was one of impropnety: it was uncer. tai, and it was always found that the tax-g.therer got
ich. There was something peculiar about money-it sticks to the fingers which handle it; and ho had found continuosly, in his experience of life, that the tax-gatherer was the most flourishing man in the small community in which he lived. HA therefore approved of the tivo associations directing their attention to the mode of collecting the taxes of the country. lIe considered that mode of distribution involved all the mischiefs of the country. lHe asked for what were the taxes levied, and explained their object ostensibly. They were for the purpose of protecting the people of this country,-thesr persons, their property, and reputations lie said, when that is fully accomplished all the purposes of government have really been attained, and all that iS laid on the people beyond that requisite to that end is so much stolen froml the people. B^t any one who looked at the institutionsof the eountryand saw howmuehoftho0se
institutions went to the great end of which he spoke, must know how much the people were robbed. We have persons for
parade, we have persons for service-and the last bear a very small proportion to the first. He had heard in the -ouse of Commons the whole afternoon occupied about giving some hard-working man 1001., and in the next breath, and before you can turn your head round, they have voted away one million of money. He apuealed to the chairman if that had not occurred in his experince, which had not been quite so long as his own. He then said he had comne to the point at which he supposed they would differ, for it struck him that associations such as the one he wvas addressing arose ont of the faulty institutions of the country. lIe said,We ought not to be meeting here, gentlemen. We have people whom we choose every seven years, whose business it is to do the duties we are now doing. I want to know what the Parliament in Westminster sits for. (A Voice"That's the point.") Do they sit there to look on while we work? Vhat isit we are doing now? We are going into the very discussion inlto which Parliament ought to go night after night. We have our power, because the
mischief has riseu to such a height that people won't stand it any longer, and they take this extraordinary
mode of expressing their opinion. Now, what I want to
do is this::-I Waut to get at some effective instrument to work out the purposes wbich we are endeavouring to do iU this extrrodiinary and, if I may use the term,
spasmodic effort. HIow is that to be done ? Why, Sir, the
ouse of Commons ought to be the watosbdogs of the people.
;ow, what I want to do is to make our liouse of Commons fit. and willing to perform its dusty;* and therefore I say, Sir, that von cannot expect to have any real financial
reform until you have had Parliamentary reform. I have
pe.:aded th~ Adi isitrative lcforn Association of that
fact, and the consequence is, we bave determined that all
our organization, spreading over England as it does, allI the various means we have of influencing puxblic opinion, are to be directed to that end, as well as to the direct aim of the association. And what we intend to do is this,-first of all, to persuade the people that the great miischief lies in the present constitution of the House of Commaons, andl to bring your minds round to demand a, full reform of that House. We intend-and here I am mnaking a bold declsaratien, and it may, Sir, probably alarm you-we intend to do our utmost to affect the coming elections of this country ; and from that we intend to direit our efforts to the formation of a real party in the House of Commons, vhose business andl aim it will be to act as one mnan, and make the Ministers feel that we are reformers of financial reform-reformers after the mannier of the Financial Reformn Association. He (Mr. Roebuck) hoped for their co-operation and draw a picture of the construction of the "parties" in the House of Commons, again pointing out the influences 'which were used by the great psrties in London to secure the vote of M1r. A for Ministers. The great towns of this country were given, a great number of themi, the power of returning mnemabers of Parliament by the Reform Bil. They chose what they thought to be efficient representatives. Thcs.e inen, as soon as they got to London and entered the Houss of Commons, found that House divided in a very curioni mnanner. There was a line ran down it from the verr maiddle, from the Speaker's chair; and on the one aide sat the Opposition, and on the other aide sat the M~inistry ; and it was expected that every man who came into that house should take the one aide or the other. There (continued the hon. gentleman) it is, indeed, a, fact~-there are a certain wild, impracicable, wonderful set of men called independent members. (Laughter.) They wander about in space, like a planet that has no sun round which to revolve. They go about they know not where, aud they find themselves in strange places they know not how. (Lauighter and applause.) The Mfinister and his satellites (a laugh) mnake their situatinavr uncomfortable situation. Rejected from the
siitra ide, they go to the Opposition, and there they meet in the same way, with " What do you, belong to, and what do you. mean 1" and if you dlon't swear in the words of one party or the other, you are, in the slang phrase, "1nowhere." (Laughter and applause.) The consequLence of this is, that when these very simple gentlemnen come from the north, they find themselves as I say-nowhere. They do not know what to do; and Air. A brings up Mrs. A, and Mdr. A is aff'ected through the means so very well known how to be employed by the great parties in London. Mr. A is affected through Mrs. A. Oh l I have seen it, and I have known it so often-that Mrs. A wanted to go to the Queen's ball. The way to get there was to make Mr. A vote with the Minister ;.and when he voted with the Minister she received her invitation. ("1 Hear, hear," laughter, sod applause.) I ama not speaking, Sir, without my host upon this matter; I know well what I am saying; and I have known instances of cajolery of this kinid, of mean appliances of this de-
scition, of this sort of lowv and disgraceful means by which to reach a man's head andI his heart, quite as debasing as the one I have described. (Applause.) 'Well, then, had these maen found, when they camae up untainted, untouched, unknowing-had they found a party to which they could ally themselves, they would have gone there. (Hear, hear.)Btn. Finding none such, they wandered to one
sieo the other; and let mne tell you that, wandering to one side or the other, they got jinto what I find has a wonderful influence in the north as well as the south,-namely, 'what is called good society. (Laughter.) They found themselves all at once shaking hands with noble lords and noble ladfies; and it is wonderful, perfectly marvellous, to find, Sir, that gentlemen whom Ithought sturdy, well to do, well-going', honest men, who have made their way in the world-to find these people bowing dowvn to the very ground, aye, crawling uipon their belly (loud laughter) before noble scions, or
tte.tty creature-s who do not know, hardlly know, their right Zn from their left; hut because they signedl their name without their Christian name (laughter) these gentlemen were their most obedient, humble servants. (Ap.- plause.) Nlow, Sir, I do not preclude from my reprehen sion this good town of Liveripool. (Elear, hear.) I flint that there is a wonderful desire in the princely merchiants of this princely town to be thought fine gentle. men in the House. (Laughter and applause). If the,' could only hear the sort of criticism and sarcasm tha: follows their own individual debasemaent, I think the7 would be prouder of their positioni as independent men than subservient followers. Lady A. says to Lord A, 'who is th i Minister (say A, B, C, or P), who is Minister of the Crown, the Primne Minister-my Lady A says, " Who is that vulga: fellow, A, that you have introduced to me 2" (Laughter.) Hesys, "IMy dear, now don't nse that language. I a~--
kowled ge that fellow to be a vulgar fellow; I know it - knoDW it as -wel as you; but he has a vote in Parliament ; now do be civil to him." (Loud laughter.) And so she is civil to him, and the poor man votes ever after a. Lord A bids him. And these are your watchdogs. (Laughter and applause.) He (Mr. Roebuck) wantedi to point out through the Administrative Reform Association every time in which a man thus actually departedi from his duty and betrayed his trust to the people, and he believed that they could do that by means of that organization. He believedI they would do much good by instructing thiepeople. Yet if they got to learn in that way the feelings of the people upon their represenLtatives they would do much more to carry financial reform than all the pamphlets they might publish. It appeared to him that when they had got together evenx a very small body of mnenx who would say they would act a,; one man, they would make the Minister understand that they would set their face against all the maladmninistration of which he was the instrument. When they had done that, andl if they had only gathered together six men who would say so, before next session came there would be added to their number many a revolting independent gentleman. He hoped to see the chairman join that party, and he hoped to see every independent constituency telling their member that he must do so too-that he must not ally himself with the one aristocratic part or the other, but that he must consider the people of England. (A%lause.) He instanced the cases where men of worth and ab .ty had been set aside for soime empty jackanapes who had just, come from college or his mother's drawing-rcoou, and who, strutting up the hiouse, was made a great man at once. He denounced the way they paid the army, and reiterated his former phrase, that it was " an army of lions led by asses.", He referred to the number nf famous admirals England had pessessed, and who liad sprung from the people, a-nd to the scarcity of generals. The navy was not then an aristocratic service; the army always was. There was a fine coat, there was Captain So-and-so; and, as Sir Walter Scott said, " Women, like turtles, are taken by a piece of red rag." The armny was a sort of r-efuge for the destitute aristocracy. The consequlence of this was seen in the Crimea-a standing ignominy to the people of England, who bore sutch a thing ; and not till they had seen the fatal result, the fatal policy, read in such dreadful characters on the plains of the Crimea, did they rise up to ask for army reformn. He said army reform was administrative reform. The consequences did niot extend only to that to whichi he had aluded, but he found, though he was unable to prove it inthe progress of the investigation of the Sebastopol Comnmittee, that every step of the inquiry was marked by proofs of corruption, and that corruption .went to high places. He wanted that corruiption laid bare. He thiought, with the party int the House oZ Commons he spoke of, they should be able to probe the mischief, and let out the very foul substances, and he hoped that what he knew to be a fact would not long exist. In conclusion he said, - I know, Sir, that real honest and distinguishedi mercantile houses refused to have anything to do with Government contracts, because they were obliged to preface their proceedings by bribing the departmnents. (gear, hear.) I am not nowv speaking in a whisper. What I am now sayinig I see the gentlemen below wvill tell to the people of England. And I am as sure of this as I am of mny own existence-that from the very top to the bottom of the standing departmnents, the permanient departmenits, of this country, there is corruption to be found. I want this expoced. It can only be done by a united effort on the part of the people of this country, acting through the House of Com'mons, and upon the Hlouse of Commnons. This R-eform Association may work its heart out, but the people who profit by the mischiefs which they perpetrate will laugh it to scorn. But let the House of Commttons once lay its finger upon their gains, and they wil feel that little finger a very heavy one. It is by their means alone you can effect your purpose; and I would ask and entreat of you to bear this in mnind, that we are acting now, here in this hall, in what I would call in the cant phrase of the day an abnormial condition. It is not our proper business to undertake the business of the House of Commnons ; but we ought to have a House of Commons which would supersede such meetinigs as this. In order, then, that we mnay, by our united effoerts, contribute to this great end, I h-ave acceptedl the invitation to come here. I determiniied to say what I have said the momnent I aPPeared before the people of this great town, because I thought, by stating it to an audience likce the present, it 'Would make its way tbrough all parts of the country-and I see it Will (looking at the reporters). I thought by so doing I should conduce to the iaime end youx have in view, the saisse end I have in view, and I believe all right-minded men have in view, and I am aure that every mnan who wishes thle prosprity of England will have in view; and, having attained that end, Sir, I shall certainy have attained the great end and object of mny life. [The hon. gentleman resumed his seat amid vociferious applause.]
Several other gentlemnen addrmesse the meeting and moved resolutions approvinig the principles of the association, which were unanimously adopted. A petition in fa-vour

The Late Case Of Forgery At The Mansion-
THE LATE CASE OF FORGERY AT THE IANSIONHOUSE.-At the Judge.' Chambers yesterday (Friday) the case of Edward Horace Montefiore, which appeared in The Times of Tuesday, was mentioned. The defendant, who is confined in Whitecross-street Prison, was arrested on a Judge's order as he was abont leaving the Mansion-house on his discharge by the Lord Mayor on the alleged charge of forgery on the Cape of Good Hope Bank, his Lordship being of opinion that he had no jurisdiction to entertain the matter. A summons for the discharge of the defendant was heard on Wednesday before Mr. Justice Coleridge, at the suit of a gentleman named Hewitt, from whom the defendant had obtained a ship in the name of Lansfield, and given his acceptance, payable at the Bank of England. The defendant, in his affidavit, denied that he intanded to quit the country; but, on the contrary, was engaged to marry a lady, and meant to reside in London. The application for the discharge was opposed by Mr. Ribton, as counsel for the plaintiff, and sapported by Mr. Lewis (Lewis and Lewis) on the part of tile defendant. Ir. Justice Coleridge entertained a doubt on the matter, and gave the defendant the benefit of it by ordering his discharge. The order was made on Wednesday, butt did not apply to the several detainers agains6 the defendant, Several Eummonses, returnable at chambers on Friday, were served on the parties to show cause wby be should not be discharged at their suit. The defendant in his affidavit denied that neinrtended to leave the country. The parties on the other aide required time ta answer the allegations, and the several saummonses stood over till Monday, the defendant still remaimng in WhitecLsos-street Prison,

A deputation from the Society of Friends presented a memorial, stating that the intended new street in Southwark would pass over part of the burialgronnd in Redeross-stree, Southwark, of which they are trustees, and that the remaining part would, in aU probability, be wanted for building parposes, the foundations of which would interfere with bodies interred therein. They therefore suggested that legal provision should be made to protect any human remains that were in the ground.
Mlr. STEBRY, on behalf of the deputation, expressed a hope that the Board would comply with the request of the memorialists, and thereby save them the trouble and expense of attending before a committee of the House of Commons.
The CHAIRMAN said, the Board were bound to take all necessary care of any human remains that might be met with while carrying out works under the act of Parliament, and no doubt in the present case every attention would be paid to that part of their duty.
the memorial was then referred to the Works and Improvements Committee.
THE NEWV STREET,S Mr. WRIGH11T moved-
` That the folowing recommendations of the Committee of Works and Improvements be adopted-that the designs which may be sent in to the Board by the several competitors, showing tho best mode of laying out the surface and subsoil of the new streets, and other particulars described in the resolution of the Board of the 16th of January, be referred to a coinmittee of seven prrsons, consisting of four professional men, and the chairman and two other members of this Board; that the Comnittee of Works be authorized to select four professional men for that purpore; and that the Board do nominate the two members to be associated with the chairman."
Mr. DoILToN seconded the motion. After a very long discussion,
Major LYON moved as an amendment-
"That two professional men be elected instead of four to assist the cowmittee."
Mr. Aldernan CUrr-T, ILP., seconded the amendment, and said that, from what he had seen of subways in the Rue de Rivoli and in the Boulevard de Sebastopol, in Paris, he felt impressed with the fact that the subject of subwvays was at present by no means developed,
Ir. SEEI,EY objected to receiving reports from professional men of 'whose abilty and experience they wero necessarily ignorant. Such a course must lead to endless confusion.
The amendment was put and negatived, and the original motion was carried by a majority of three-13 voting for it and 10 against it.
After the disposal of a great deal of routine business the Board adjourned at half-past 6 o'clock.
THE MAILS.-SOUTHAMPTON, Friday.-The Royal
THE MAnLS.-SOUTHA.WTO-, Friday.-The Royal Mail Company's steamship *Medway, Captain Parker, is appoiuted to take out the Brazil and River Plate mails of the uth prox., instead of the Tyne. The latter vessel, lately stranded off St. Alban's Head, has been lightened about 200 tons, by taking out part of her machinery, floats from the paddles, &c., and it is expected that the tnal to get the ship off will be made on Sunday or Monday if the weather should permit. Captain Vincent and others are still very sanguine as to the result. The Tamar, now at Vigo, cannot be repaired before the arrival at thal port of the next Peninsular steamer hence (the Madrid), which will take out a new rudder and crank pin for the Tamar; therefore she wiU not be able to leave Vigo before the first week in February. The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamer Madrid, Captain Bra-shaw, will take out the next Peninsular mail onthe 27th inst.; and the Ripon, Captain R. W. Evans, will leave with the India and Cb;n* mails on the 4th of Fcbrt'ary. The Alhambra, Captain Joy, having been detained by bad weather on the outrard voyage with the Peninsular mails, vwill be delayed beyord her usnal time of arrival here, and is not expected till the 26th or 27th in.tead of the 24th. The Union Steamship Company's screw steamer Norman, Captain Vallint, sailed hence to-day for the Brazils with about 200 tops of cargo, specie value a5,0591. 1Os., and jewelry value 1,3001.
USE OF THE STRAP IN A SILK MILL.-On Thursday William Tabner, overlooker in the silk mill of Messrs. Leas and Booth, at Patricroft, was brought before Mr. H. L. Trafford and other county magistrates at Salford, charged with beating a young married woman, in a state of pregnancy, while working in the mill. Thecase had bcen partly heard on Tuesday, when county police-sergeant Barlow stated that frequent complaints had been made of this man's violence for eight or nine months past. There was now a child laid up at home in consequence of injurie5 received by the defendant beating it with a strap; and one of the girls who had been employed at the mill, named Welsh, was so severely beaten by this man that she was a mass of bruises from the top of her head to the soles of her feet. Witness had been to see her, and had found her arms, shoulders, and breasts completely black. He had never seen such a sight before in his life. He had never seen a human being beaten in such a manner, and should be sorry himself if he had treated a brute in such a way. It was in consequence of this statement of Barlow's that Mr. Trafford had adjourned the case in order that the evidence might be made more complete. He observed that he had had 20 summonses applie for from this mill against their workpeople for leaving work without notices to one from any other milL He had wondered that such should be the case, and now he saw the reason. He would have the matter thoroughly investigated, and he directed the police to spare no pains in summoning any witnesEes necessary to a full inquiry. It was enough to make one's blood run cold to hear of a big fellow like the defendant walking about among a number of women and children with a strap in his hand, to use if neces6rry to keep them in awe. When the case came on on Thursday for furtber hearing the defendant was represented by Ilr. Fernley, barrister. The police officer said he apprehended the prisoner on Sunday upon a warrant, and told him the charge was for assaulting a young woman. Tho prisoner said at the time, "Well, I will allow that I did hit her with a strap, but not so as to make anv mark; it was a very easy blow." Alice Mullaney, a young married Irishwoman, was then called, and stated that she was employed in the silk mill of Messrs. Lee6 and Booth as a silk clepner. The prsoner was overlooker. On tho 16th of January, at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, he came behind her, and, without saing a word, and without the slightest provocation, struck
er on the neck a hard blow with a strap, She turned round, thinking he must have struck her in mistake, and asked him if the blow was intended for her. Hes aid it was, and that he would do it again. In reply to a question from Mr. Trafford witness said she had frequently seen the prisoner strike young children with the strap. Mr. Fernley, for the prisoner, objected to any evidence being taken that did not apply to the specific charge before the Court. Mr. Trafford said evidence had been given on the previous day which revealed a state of things that ought to be inquired into, but what the learned counsel urged was he strictly legal course, and if the wish wvas to suppress investigwon he (the magi6trate) must acquiesce, althougb, the employers of the man being in court, he thought for their sak-esthey should desire it togo on. The next witness was Mrargaret Woodcock a young woman working in the mill, who corroborated the statement of the complainant as to the essault, and Mr. Trafford asked her what the strap was generally used for. Witness replied, "To strike little children and young women with. He never used it for anythig else, and she had seen him beat children with it shamneflly." Mr. Fernley again objected that they were travelling out of the case. Mr. Trafford said his last question was strictly in order. Jano Caton corroborated the eviadence of the last witness. Mr. Fernley said he reserved Isis defence, if the case was to go before a jury, believing that there was an amount of prejudice against his client on the part of the Court. Mr. Trafford thought it would be best to send the caso to the sessions, and committed the prisoner for trial accordingly. He afterwards consented to take bail, in two sureties of 20L each, for the prisoner's appearance at the essions. The manager of the mill, with the manager of another mill, entered into sureties for the prisoner, and he was liberated. It is understood to be the itention, since an cxpoid of the whole case against the prisoner could not be aone into- owng to the objection raised by counsel, to tare the evidence of siX or eight other persons who havo been aslaulted by Tabner, and found on them other indictments at e sessions.

Art Manufacture Exhibition At Edinburgh.
I ART MANUFACUREA
BITIOIV G1!
After a brief but very suceesful season, the first snnuaL, exhbition of the Art Manufacture Association of Sootlad
in the National Gallery at Edinburgh, closes to.day. Froni. its opening, on the 13th of December last, it is eatimate,
that it has be en visited bv considerably upwards of 60 OM, persons. At first the objects of the association and'thb
merits and extent of the collection were so little known that. the saloons were very thinly sprinkled with visitors, and; even the Christmas holydays did comparatively little to swell the numnbers of those resorting to it. From New Year's-day-the great Christmas holyday in Scotland-wher the exhibition was opened at somewhat reduced charges, it;. really commenced to be popularly attractive, and since then,. while very largeandfhionablethrongshaveattendedits daily promenades, the galleries have been perfectly crowded im the evenings with the middle and working Casses of the. community. So far, therefore, as regards the primAry objecb. of theasRociation of awakeningapopularinterestiatbeobiectsof art, its leadingpromoters havemetwithgreatsuccess. The7 have brought together a coUection far exceeding their original anticipations in brilliancy, variety, and mnagnitude_. while they fiave attracted towards it the attention alike of thepaironsand the producers of ornamental art. They have presented many objects of rare beauty both in ancient. and modern art to the admairing eye of the connoisseur, and. they have afforded to the general community a valuable opportunity of cultivating and elevating the popular taste. It is satisfactory to know that the working classes have visited the exhibition in great nurbers, and given their studious attention to its contents The pupils of nearly allthe. public academies, schools, and hospitals have been admitted. n the muoenings, and every encouragement has been given to the v:sits of the young. It may also be added that as the reputation of the exhibition has spread it has .acted. many strangers to Edinburgh on purpose to s6dit. In a pecuniary point of view the results of the exhibiton have been highly satisfactory. The receipts will now, it is ascertained, be sufficient to repay the expensed. bot of furnishing the gaUeries and of management. These expenses have been necessarily very large under both heads. for the first exhibition, and wfill to a very considerable extent be obviated in future years, both by the association. beingpossessad of their present valuable fittings, and by their aving acquired experience in the conduct of' uch undertakings.
In the course of the exhibition several evenings have been devoted to conrcrsm:iones and lectures. Among the speakersand subjects have been,-Professor . Wilson "On the Application of Ornatmental to Industrial Art ` Mx. li Wellwood, of Pitliver, " On the History of iluropea Pence.
lain "andl M. C. 1-I. Wilson, Glasgow, "On the Improvement of Ornamental Art ;" and the concluding lecture was to be given last night by the hon. secretary, htr. A. Christie, "On the Objects of the Association in forming the Ehbto.
The exhibition has given a greatstinulus to the subsscipi. tious to the association, which, as we have formerly stated,
combines with other purposes those of an art-union for the. distribution bv allot of objects of ornamental art. The subscribers wll all receive a return for their guinea in some suitable household ornament, while the ballot will also inelude several prizes of considerable value. Since the exhibition opened the members have increased from about 1,500 to above 3,000; and, as the number is daily increasing a large acession mvay be anticipated before the drawnng, which we believe is to take place early in the summer.. When it is remembered that the London Art Union and the Glasgow Art Union, the former of which has reached 14,000 and tbe latter last year 20,000 subscribers, had little, more than 400 or 509 at their outset, the commencement of the new Art Union may be regarded as a very prosperous one. Owing, no doubt, to the influence of the exhibition considerable numbers of English subscribers have within the last week or two been enrolled. Though the association is a Scottish one, it has thus become indebted to the sister country both for the great enterprise and liberality which English houses have shown in contributing to its exhibition, and for the additional support now being received in behalf of its objects as an Art Mnion.
The Committee of Management have for some days been engaged in the purahase of prizes for distribution among the subscnibars. Among the principal objects of art already secured "y them for that purpose we may notice a silver gilt vase, with carved buckhorm panels, representing the
Leend of St. HRbert." It is manufactured by Messrs. Phillips, Brothers, of London, and is valued at 121. They have also chosen a shield, representing the " Dattle of Alexander and Darius," from the collection of Messrs. Mackay and C"nningham, Edinburgh, price 701.; a silvergilt tea and coffee service, from the same house, price 821. ; a small cheval timepiece, by Mr. Cole, London, price 301.; two siver and silver-gilt desert compotiers, from Lambert and Rawlings, London, price 401. Numerous selections of valuable and artistic objects have also been made in bronze, porcelain, wood carving, &c., from the collections of Iessrs. Elkington, Birmingham; Marshals, Edinburgh; Copeland. London; Minton, Stoke-upon-Trent; Kerr and. Binns, WorcPster; Jackson and Graham, L3ondon; Hill, Thomson, and Co., Edinburgh, &c. The very numerous purchases made in nearly every department by private persons will lik-ewise contributetowardsrewarding the enterpnise of the exhibitors.
The only matterof regret in connexion wvithi theexhibition isthe brief period of its duration. The galleries being immediately required for the annual exhibition of the paintings of the Royal Scottisch Academy, no extension of the period. can possibly be granted, so that after the promenade and. convcrs-soc; of this evening the brilliant contents of the Art Manufacture Exhibition will be dispersed.

EXPERIMENTS ON BEETROOT.-Three examiners.
EXPERqITS oX BEETOOT.-Three examiners. of Her Majesty's Excise are at this time in attendance at Farnigham near Dartford, in the county of Kent, superintending a beetroot and mangold-wurtzel distillery, erected by permission for experimental purposes by Messrs. William Dray and Co., of Swan-lane, London, on Mr. Dray's farm at Farningham. At this distiUlery the advantages of agricultural distilleries will be largely and amply tested. Mr. Dray is feeding some hundred sheep and a number of buUocks on the residues of beet after distiUation-a system wlhch has been pursued with great success on the continent. Two millions sterling in value of beetroot spirits were distilled in France last year, wvlue in 1853 only 20,000l. worth was distiled. There is a peculiarity in the system pursued at Farningham, which is so contrary to alU received notions on the subject that we wiUl describe it. Instead of macerating the beet and distilling the wort, the beetroot is cut into long thin strips, one inch wide by an eighth of an inch thick, by means of a cutter, cutting three-quarters of a ton in half anhour. It is then placed in vats, containing threequarters of a ton each, and 300 galons of a wort formed by macerating a certain quantity of beet at the commencement of the operations, anud which wort is used for the same purpose during the distiling months, which arc from September the 15th to April the 15th in France, and from October the 1st to May the lst in Belgium and Germany, for during these months the beet and mangold-wurtzel are in the best. statefordistiUation. After the slices are p laced in thefermenting vats about a quart of sulphuric acid is added to each vat. Fermentation sets in ra pidly. and in 24 liours the slices are in a fit state for distillation. They are then withdrawn froma the vats, and placed inutpright eylindersof ironin Mr. Dray's distillery which is calculated to distil five tons of roots in the 24 ours. The oylinders are Oft. high and 2ft. in. diameter. The slices are placed upon diaphragms, or plates of iron pierced with holes, 10 in each cylinder. The cylinders are then hermeticaUy closed, a current of steam is let into the bottoni of No. 1, and in three-quarters of an hour a raw spirit resembling smnau stiU whiskey is produced at proof. This spirt is allowed to run over till it falls to 2) under proof, when the steam is conducted from Xo. 1 inoN.2 cylinder, the escape of the alcholie vapour being shut off. Thus the slices in IKO. 1 cylinder are completely deprived of their alcholio matter by continuing the curnt of steam through them, and carrying it on into No. 2. InL three-quarters ofan houirthe esape-pipe for conductine the, alcholic vaponr from No. 2 t;o the worm bein opn, .no. 2 begins to run off at 20 over proof, is again allowed to run down to 20 under. when the escape-jpipe is again shut and the steam from No. 2 conduted into No. 3. In threequarters of an hour the spirit again runs off from No. 3.
In the meantime No. 1 has been emptied of the slices and refiUed, and the stream from No. 3 is allowed to enter. No.L The spirit is cullected into casks, and in tche French distilleries is passed through a rectifying still oririly on two days in the week, and the produce is a 5serfectly neutral spirit of any required strength. This in-. dustryhas caused a complete revolution in farming in France. In the districts of Valenciennes and St. Quentin, where it most prevails, the number of bullocks fattened h
incremed from 11,000 to 17,000, and the sheep fattened from 70,000 to 140,000. The amnount of corn sown hais. also nearly doubled. As this production of food for cattle has greatly increased the production of manure, it has caused its usual results-a greater production of corn. Mr. Dray has kindly offered to allow persons to inspect his ditilery on obtaining a card at his warehouses in Swau-lame and the director will give every information which can b desired.-Civil &r-icac azete.
