REroimTonRms.-A retirn obtained by Mr. Adderley, MIP., shows that 26 reformatories have been certified in England and Scotland, capable of containing altogether 1,500 persons; and in Scotland (under the act of the 17th and 18th of Victoria, chap. 74), 11, capable of containing 1,799. Certificates have been refused to the Cambridge Reformatory, at Cambridge ; and to the IHome in the ERst, at Old Ford, Bow, Middlesex. The former certificate was 3efused on the ground that it was not desirable to combine, as proposed, areformatoryschool foryoung offenders with an existing industrial school at Cambridge for other classes of boys. The certificate to the Rome in the Bast, at Old Ford, Bow, was refused in October, 1S54, on the -rouad that the premises were not, -when inspected, convement to the purposes for wlinch they were appropriated, and on the further ground, as we regret tofind, that there were " defects in the employment, cleanliness, and clothing-of the boys," whicl, however, the inspector v;as told would be remedied, and on the further ground that unwillin" inmates could not be compulsorily detained. In October, 1855, an renewed agplication was made, and the inspetrhvn eoted that the bailding and g-deneral condition of the institution were in a much more satisfhctory condition than at the time of his forner visit, a certificate was granted. Mlr.r uSY SAVDMGS-BAS, nr THE CBnrs .-The General Order of the 3d of February, 1855, directing the partial suspension of the operations of the regimental savings-banks in the Crimea, was published on Saturday. We subjoin the text of the order:-' Head-quarters before Seba-topol, Feb. 3, 1855.-With the view to relieve commanding officers and others from the business of the savings-banks, without in any degree depriins the soldiers of the advantage of depositing their savino, at interest, the Commander of the Forces with the concurrence of the Secretary-at-War, directs the temporary suspension of the Savings-bank Regulation from the 31st of 31arch, 1855. Commanding offlicers will cause aU savings-bank documents to be forwarded immediately after the 31st of March to the afficer commanding the depOts at home, and report to the Secretary-at-War when this shall have been done. All moneys actually deposited wiU continue to bear the sual iaterest, and instructions wiUllbe sent by the Secretaryat-War to officers commanding regiments as to the marme.r ir which soldiers' remittances from abroad shall be made through the regimental pay list to the savings bank at the depUt. A correct list of the balances due to depositors on the day of suspension is to be retained by the commanding ohfficer, wo is at liberty to sanction, in special cases; the withdrawal of sums in deposit up to that date, taking the soldier's receipt in duplicate, one to be retained, and one to be forwarded to the depOt. A statement of casuLalties among depositors must be forwarded monthIy to the depOt. The mames of the sergeants, corporals, 'and private soidiers recomrmendedforgratuities for gallant conduct in the field, under the lovaL warrant of the 4tlh of December, 184, wil -be forwarded to the depOts, with directions that the several amounts shall be credited in their accounts in the savings baLk, and bear interest until the men are discharged."

(Hear, hear.) I believe I have authority to state also that Lord Wensleydale will put himself sufficiently in the hands of the Government, at all events, not to attempt to take his seat until time for due consideration of the whole of -this subject has been given. I shall not now say a single word either in justification of the step taken by the Government or in condemnation of the course which the House has adopted ; but I think it must be quite evident to your lordships there is considerable difficulty in the position in which we find ourselves. On the one hand, Her Majesty has been advised,and is advised,that she is perfectly competent to exercise her prerogative; and on the other hand, your lordships, by a large majority, following the advice of the majority of those noble lords who are learned in the law, have declared that the Crovw is not competent to make that exercise of the prerogative. On the part of Her Majesty's Government, I can only say that, if time is given, they w1il be most anxious to approach the consideration of this subject free from any feelings of a personal or party nature (cheers); and I think I may say confidently, the spirit of the House will be of a eorresponding character. (Renewed cheers.) Lord CAMPBELJL-I have heard with the greatest satisfaction the statement of the noble earl, and I am sure it will be responded to in the same spirit by your lordships. (Hear, hear.) I have been accused of a little pugnacity in this matter, but no one can be more eager for peace than I am myself, and no one will rejoice more at a satisfactory solution ofthe difficulty. (Hear, hear.) The Earl of DERBY.-My lords, I feel thsat the statement of the noble lord the President of the Council is one which ought to be received with considerable satisfaction. It is quite clear there is, on the part of members on all sides of the house, every disposition to meet the further discussion ofthissuDiect in a spirit entirely free from anything like party feeling, and with a sincere desire to arrive at a satis. factory conclusionwith regardctoit. (Hear, hear.) I must say, atthe same time, that the House of Lords was placed in a position in -which they had no alternative. The question was forced upon them for decision by what I mnust call the rather inconsiderate act of Her Majestys Go-. vernment. [Earl GBn ivmr-" Let bygones be bygones."7 We were precluded avoiding a decision, because, while I am quite ready to admit that the amendment of the noble earl opposite was couched in moderate terms, it recognized the principle that it was ajlegal exercise of the prerogative, andg if we had sasente4 to thosevesolutions- we should have been in the position of introducing restrictions, not as a right on the part of Parliament, but by grace and favour of the Crown. We were called upon to say whether we admitted the prerogative to be unrestricted and unlimited, and proposed subsequently to modify it, or whether we were prepared to affirm that the power did not exist, and its existence or exercise hereafter must be a subject of consideration for this and the other House ofParliament. Isay that, inthat position, we had no neutral ground to occupy, but were compeled to declare, "Aye ! "or "No I" did the prerogative exist to its full extent and to an unlimiteddegree? I think we had no alternative but to come to a decision one way or the other. The admission of Baron Wensleydale would have settled the righAt for ever, and therefore we were driven to choose between the rights of this House and the prerogative of the Crown. I am quite sure that nothing can be more painful to your lordships than tohave your lordships House for a single moment in even apparent collision with the Crown (hear, hear), but we did not take that position voluntarily-it was forced upon us. (Hear, hear.) I wil say frankly that, after the expression of the opinion of the House by a considerable majority, and after the expression of the opinion of many who voted in the minority, that, though strictly legal, it would be a highly unconstitu. tional, inconvenient, andeven dangerousprecedent, I should be better satisfied if Her Majesty's Government were to go one step further and issue a new patent to Lord Weusleydale, giving the usual peerage to him and his heirs, and removing his name from further controversy. (Hear, hear.) Icannot help thinking that, even with regard to the future consideration and discussion of this matter shadowed forth by the noble earl, such a step would facilitate the progress of our discussion. We could then proceed without the slightest reference to the manner in which individuals might be affected, and we should be free to canvass the principle on its merits, exclusive of any consideration and diffculty in consequence of this patent remaining stiU in abeyance. (Hear, hear.) But, my lords, in whatever m.anner this question may be brought forward, I can assure the noble earl on the part of myself and my friends, we shall be ready to ap proach the discussion in the most temperate and impartial spirit. (Hear, hear.) I quite admit, apart from the consideration of the validity of the late exercise of the prerogative of the Crown, the question of the infusion of life peerages in the constitution of this House is one of the greatest possible magnitude end deserving the deepest and most carefui consideration. (Hear.) I wil not pronounce any absolute or irrevocable opinion, but I may be permitted to say I see that some advantages, in certain cases and under certain modifications, May' aise from peerages for life. On the other hand, so eat is the danger from the precedent, however limited and efmed, that I see the necesity of careful inquiry to ascertam what restrictions should accompany these peerages. I confess the feeling of my own mind is, that for any practical purpose there are other modes preferable to the creation of peerages for life. (Hear, hear.) I do not wish to pronounce any absolute or positive opinion, but, though it ma be considered somewhat premature, for the prse rather of opening this question to the consideration of your lordships, 1 should wish to ask of Her 3ajesty's Government-as we have never yet heard them statedl-what are the objects for the attaimaent of which it is desirable to introduce a novel precedent for the exercise of the preroontive of the Crown? 9When we know the objects intended to be attained, then we shall see whether the means are properly adapted to those objects, or whether they can be accomplished in another and less objectionable manner. (Erear, hear.) I am not quite sure whether this power is to be resotted to or the purpose of confeimng honour on those to whom these peerages are to be granted, or for the more efficient conducting the business of this House. With regardto conferring honour, I cannot but think the Government have overrated the anxiety felt by any person to receive this nugatory distinction. Icannot help thinking it would be considered by persons on whom it was conferred as very lke (to use the Chinese expression) a second chop peer. (A laugh.) AndI also think that at the moment of conferr-n honour you would be inflicting a species of njIury. thin} a man, with sons to succeed hSm, would be reluctant to accept for his own personal advantage a seat in this house, and, vith hisown consent, debarhisnatu-al heirs from succeeding to those honours. It is said to be very desirable to conferthesepeerages on individualswho have not the means to bear the burden of an hereditary weerage. If that be so, in the case of persons with large families and small means, by asunming the neereae they entail upon themselves great expense, andla out, ortheirownpersoal advantage dunng their lifetime, a considerable portion of the income which the ought properly to lay by for the benefit of their fawniles who are to succeedthem. The sacrifice of p;ospective inrease of means in the-case of a peer man, andthe reluctancetodeprive hissuccessorsof what miightbe considered their'just arightsinthse of arich man, asedoubtainmy mindw ether, forthe purposeofconferring honour, lifepeerage is of any very great advzntage. (Hear.) Then, if we are to have any modifications or restrictions in point of numbers, that will bew olly insuficient to meet the age Ify% lieergareXe in fttheemselvesobjectionawble, objections. To restrict thge numnbesr bbyt etnnacntoinge that ;ny ene ortwo such peerages shall be created within a certain timemay be a still further restrition mand stil rwould rot le satisfactory. ThenI come to the 'question, [what ethe classes from wvhom you intend to select those persons upon whom, not being men of opulence sufficient to enable them to bear the burden of hereditary peerages,yen intend to confer these life prages? I assume, of course, that there is no desire to tai for the Govenm.nt of the day a temporary advantage by suchrcations. (Hear, hear.)' I assne, so, that it is not intended to take, for example, Euch members of the other House who have for anumber of years been faithful adherents of the Government, and remove them in their oldag to the comparative ease and quiet of yonr lordshipev.1use, as yon would transfer an old hunter from the field to the easier work of the farm, and keep him there till he is. quite worn out, and then supply his place with another half exhansted anim1a from, the same stable. ("HIear," and a laugh.) I do not know whether it is intended to select these life peers from men eminent for their qualifications in literature or science. I do not' at all deny there may be instances of such porsons as would be omnaments to this House and whom, it might be desirable to see here; but, as a rule, I confess, whether looking to the honour to be conferred upon suc'n persons, or the services they are likely to perform in this house, I do not think they form a class from which it is desirable to select peers for life. I think men of literature or science are too much absorbed [in those pursuits, and have not had their attention sufficiently directed to political affairs to render them -although very valuable persons in their own sphereslkely to be veryusef merembers of this Eouse. Of this I am sure, that to hold out as a bait to literary and scientific men a number of life peerages would have a tendency to corrupt and deprave the lterature and science of the country, and to introduce among its professors the pernicious habit of looling not to their reputation with posterity, but to tho favour of the Government of the day. (EHear.) I can conceive nothing more fatal to the independence of literaturo than to hold out to its professors the prospect of temporary eerages conferrible by favour of the 3inniter of the CIown. en come the classes 6f the army and navy; and as to them I admit the case is morpdobtful; butnon the grounds I have already uentioned, I think it exceedingly problematical whether any of ficer of the army or navy would not consider himself rather lowered by the bestowal of such a peerage, and whether he would not rather refuse it than accept it, clogged with a condition that his. family should not enjo the nobility tobe bestowed upon himself, which Iam satisfied v'ould be the general opinion among officers of the army and navy. There are honours and rewards which may be conferred with a liberal, even a lavish hand; but then let those rewards and honours be well adapted to the circumstances of eachease, and do notintroduceinto this house, on account ofsmilitary,merit,apersonupon whomatthesametimeyoucast a stigma by saying he s not competent tobe the founder of a family to take a place among the hereditary peers. I am quite certain that the officers of either service are eVnaUi undesirous of a seat in this house upon such teros. el then, I come to the class on whose account it is pre,med this mode of dealing with the House was chiefly adopted-I mean the lawyers. It is not intended to confer these peerages upon lawyers for the purpose of bestowing honour upon individuals of the profession of the law,towhom Iimagene such distinctionswotld be comparatively insignificant, but to remedy tbeallegedde. fects in the constitutionof thisHounse, andto strengthen your judicial and not your legislative functions. That I apprehend is the main cause of this step which we have been discussing, and I think I am not doing injustice to the motives of the Government when I state them to be ' the infusion of legal talent into this house. I am not pre. pared to say-and I say it with.great deference-that I am entirely satisfied with the working of the appellate jurisdiction of this House; but I am by no means sure that the only remedy for confessed imperfections in the judical Jrisdictionof this Houseistobefoundinthe creation of anuinberof life peers to sbare in aU the deliberations of this House. NWor do I think the proposed remedy would entail any very great advantage by introducing in all debates a number of lawyem, and especaly retiredlawyers, who, baving nothing to do in the courts, possess no means of displaying their eloquence, and their introduction here I think would rather tend to the length than-I say so with great respect for that learned body-to the intellgence and importanceofourdebates. ("Hear, 'andlaughter.) canot help tbiningthat, if you place the appellate jurisdiction of this House on a par with the Judiial Committee of the Privy Council, we shall be fearfuly lawyer-ridden (laughter), and the worst anticipations of the noble earl opposite (Earl Grey) confamed, and we shall all find the remedy to be womse than the disease it is intended to cure. l am not myself impressed with the necessity of life peerages; I see great dangers and inconveniences l-ely to arise from them, but am not convinced of their necessity, although I readily admit there are poits connected with the appellate jurisdiction of this Houso which cannot be defended. In the first placc,I agree with my noble friend on the cross benches who the other night spoke for the first time in this house wth great ability, and m a manner which assures us that he will be a considerable ornament to this House. (Hear, hear.) I quite agree that nothing can defend a mere sham -the putting two or three of your lordships to sit in rotation by the side of learned judges to hear argrments, taking no Teal part in the proceedings, but only keeping up a fiction. ' uat is a sham, and no sham can be satisfactory or reflect credit upon this House. There is another point on which I thinir this House, as a court of appeal, is placed in an unpleasant position-I mean as to Scotch appeals. Although, by accident, there may be amonz your lordships one or two conversant and skilled in the Sotch law, yet I think the reversal of the decisions of themost eminent Scottish lawyers by an apellate tribunal composed of a smallnumberof yourlordships, distinguished no doubt for learning, but not acquainted with Scottish law, constitutes a substantial grievance-more substantial than any of those pressed upon your lordships' consideration last year by my noble friend behind me (the Earl of Eglintoun) ; and, had he included that among those he dweltupon, I should have felt bound to afford him a more cordial support. (" Hear," and langhter.) I am not about to enter sfpon a detailed discussion of the existing condition of the House of Lords as a court of appellate jurisdiction, nor topropose any substitutes to remedy its defects as an alternative to the creatibon of a body of life peerages. I heard with great satisfaction from my noble and learned friend (Lord Lyndhumet) that he contemplates bringing this question under your lorcships' notice, and I am quite sure that al who have heard my nohie and learned friend in the course of these debates must be aware that at no time ias he more cempotent to deal suecessfullyandpowerfallywiththatsunc ectthanheisatpbl sent. (Hear.) I shall,therefore, reservemy observations upenthat matter util t iqs brou,ght under discussion by my noble and learned friond. I had come down with a nothce which, if m noble-and learnedfrienddoesnotproceedaUventutosub uit to the House-a notice of tEat which I think is a necessary and preparatory step towards the* decision of this great question, that he or it is essential or desirable to create life peers under any circurmstances, it is advisable to institte acareful and accurate investigation into the present working of this House as a court of appellate jurisdiction, and to inquire into the best means of remedyg any defects whinch may exist. I had sk;etched out the terms of a motion which, if my noble and learned friend does net persevere in his expressed intention, I shal enture to give notice of for Thursday, to move for " a select committee to inquire whether or net it is expedient to make any, and, if so, what provisions for the more effectually securing an efficient exercise of the functions of this House as a court of appellate jurisdiction, and to report thereon." I think it of great importance, it being avowed by all that the main ground for supportingthe introduction of life peeraes is the admitted imperfections of this House as a court of apiealt that the first thing to be done is to ascertain whether t ose defects really exist; if so, to what extent- and then by whatmodes familiar totheconstitation, or bywhatnewmode suchalterationsmaybemadetoremovetheevilseompainedof That question I will not now disenss. It may be necessary to do so when the subject comes again under your lordships' notice. Until we have satisfied ourselves that that which is the main grievance-the sant of an efficient appellate jurisdiction-cannot be remedied in any other or less convenient form than that of cseating a life peerage, I will not enter into the discussion of that question. In throwing out the suggestion I have ventured to do, if your lordships should feel inclined, I should be prepared to go into conunittee with no feeling bnt that of wishing to arrive at such a practical solution of the difficulty as should be beneficial to the country, or at least honourable and creditable to your lordships' House, and free from the slightest taint or stain of political or party bias, one way or the other. The Marquis of LAN2SDOWME.-My lords, in answering the noble earl opposite who has put some questions to Her Majestys Government, I hope that, int saying a few words in explanation on the subject, It§ha11 do so without giving &pression to a single sentence that shall at least detract from the pacific character of the conversation that is nowgoing on. (Hear, hear.) Shouldthe tonein which the present discussion has been begun be maintained, there is nothing more likely to bring about a satisfactory and complete termination of the sabject now engaging the attention of your lordships. Although it was inevitable, and insaparable from the discussion of this subject, that very grave and delicate theoretical points should be touched upon, involving as they do the very frontier and debateable land between privilege and prerogative, yet in going into those theoretical questions the practical points at issue did not in my opinion involve, nor do they now appear tome to involve, consequences so strong as are generally supposed. For we find from what has fallen from the noble earl opposite, and from the approbation with which his speech has been received, that aremedy for strengtheningthe appellate jurisdiction is, if not pressing, at least expedient, and is open to a full, fair, and candid consideration. Therefore, as noble lords opposite are prepared to go so far on the one hand, I, on the other hand, can say with every noble lord who has confirmed the proposition which forms the subject of your lordships' deliberations, that it never has entered into the head of any one of them, nor, I solemnly assure your lordships, has it ever entered into mine, that by any possibility, as arising out of these discussions, any great addition to your lordships' House by the creation of life peers, so as ixr any great measure to detract from the hereditary character of this House, should be the result of the measure they have supported, (Hear, hear.) Iam as much as any of your lordships a supporter of the instita - tion of an hereditary peerage, and I never would have con. Eented to be a party to the introdution of this measure in the assertion of this prerogative if I had not felt convinced that, for whatever purpose, or to whatever object it might be extended, whether to the legal or any other profession, the numbers would 'be few and fairly chosen, I candidly admit that, if we had been placed in the alternative of either foregoing the advantage, which was most desirable, of reinforcing the appellate jurisdiction of the House on the one hand, or of crating a great mass of life peers on the other, I should, with great respect to my noble and learned friends now happily members of this House,-with the greatest respect for them when they agree with me, with the greatest respect when they disigree from nme, and even 'with the greatest respe^t when they disagree from one another (Iaughter)I should, with such an influx as existi seemhtoul brehend,m never see more enterithis house. {"Hear, hear," and laughter.) We ae allWagreed that there: should *b a limit to the number of life peers, and the question is how the object it is desirable to attain can be effected without infringnsg poon that inportent princple. Ill bepng agreed in theory that the evil existing should bhe remedied by an ddition to the appellate jurisdicton, I thierk that the C.rown is the only proper and safe depositary of the power by which that can be accomplished. If I ua told th ththo Crown can exervise thit power without any-limit or check, and so expose this House to danger, I reply thxt I atprehend no danger, nd that, though theoreticealy there may not be v lieit, yet practeially there is a limit. There is another preroraigd not like ato be rdsimin phed-the prerogative o publie opinion-which I believe would be sufficient to override the prerogative of tho Crown and the privileges of this House in any instance in which that prerogative and those Government9lwerbstretched to any inconvenient or unconstijurionlctnoutof That legl pmyodeepeconviction. am no right to assume that noble lords opposite should have the same conviction. I believe- that the opinion naturally, if not correctly, entertained by Yaem is one wich ought to be met by some counterpoise -and all Idesire is, that the subjectat e thter calm delierationand with as little delay as possible. I admit that the object of the Government las been the reinforcement of theappellate jurisdiction out of the legal profession, but ram not prepared tosay thatthat object rnay be effected by the appoint ment of peerages for life without also extending it to membersofotherprofesiensinthe samedegree, andparticuelarly to the military profession. I cannot agree with the noble earl that life peerages so conferred, and connected with merits stia oinguished services, wil inflict a sort of comparative onpersons receiving those honours. The very service itself whichthose persons have rendered to their country would save them from any such senmv. It would be invldious to select particular cases that distinguished one man fromanotheras deserving of those hoours, but I wonld ask, supposing General Wolfe's life had been happily spared, after haws trnumphaut operations upon the St. l,awrence and at Quebec, and, although posses6ng no means whatever, he had accepted a life peerage, woald that distinction have been diminished from that cireumstance? On the contrary, would not his amesits have placed him on an equality with, if not in a posihion of superority over, every other member of your Jorgshipe' Houses? I should hope that, whenever this hononr should be conferred, it would never berso uless connected with merit, or as a reward of desert. The noble earl has said that few men would be found to seek an honour to be conferred in this lim ited degree. My lords, I assure him that it consists within my own knowledge that many persons, not otherwise ambitious for these honours, have. been at different times led to declne an hereditary peerage be cause they would not place their families in a position whinch, in their view, was neither respectable nor advantageous. I presume the same feeling has existed at all times. am told that, in the tame of Lord Covper, it was doubted whether the Crown had the powver to compelsa person to accept the peerage, and that at was held by Lord Mansfield that the Crown could not compel any one to accept a peerage, because the. King ought not to have the power of rmining thae famnilies of any of his subje~cts. DJuring the discussion which has been alreadv alluded to-I meanthat on what is called thepeerage question in the reign of George IL-in one of the most eloquent speeches which I have always understood a greit statesman ever delvered in the other House of Parliament, he concluded by saying that ancients had placed the Temple of Virtue in front of the Temple of Fame, for the purpose of signifying that no person could reach the one without passing through the other; but, in order to accomplish that object, the passage from the one temple to anothermust be made very easy, and men must not be expected to sacrifice their families by placing them in n position not creditable to themselves or favourable to their future prospects. It is owing to the fact that this House has been made accassible in so many other ways than by descent that it has preserved -I was going to say its eternity, though that is not aliuman word-its long existence, in which it is distingished from Cvery other assembly of the kind in the world; because, far from repellmg from its wals great talent, great genius, and great services, it has, on the contray, under the sanction and prerogative of the Crovwn, been made to attract that genius, that talent, and those services, and thus from one generation to another to strengthen and fortify the high position which it now occupies, and which I trust it ever wllU occupy in the eyes of the world. The Earl of MALMESBURY would not have risen to address their lordships but forthe encouragement given him byhisnoble friend opposite onthe first nightthis questionwas mooted, when his noble friend expressed a hope that the discussion would not be wholly confined to learned lords, but would be shared in by some of the unlearned inem'iers of their lordships' House. There was not one member of their lordshipt' House who did not feel convinced that in the hands of the noble marquis opposite the power of creating life peerages would not be abused, and that they might feel safe in the advice he would tender to the Crown with regard to such creations. (Hear, hear.) But this afforded no security for the future (hear, hear), and in that point of view it behoved their lordships to exercise a wise jealousy respecting the exerise of this power. The noble marquis had said that from his own experience he knew that the objections to an hereditary peerage which existed in the minds of some men fairly ambitious of distinction would not be entertained with regard to a life peerage,-and, to illustrate his remarks, the noble marquis said many were so conscientious on this point that they declined the honour because they did not consider themselves sufficiently opulent. The two cases, however, were hardly analogous. A man might be led to accept a peerage rather from the wish to confer a great name upon his family than to consult his own personal feelings. It was the same consiideration for his family which led him to reject a peerage in case he had not means to support it. But the case was very different when a man was offered a peerage which he was to bear and his son was not to bear. He (Lord Malmesbury) should consider such an offer as something very nearly approaching to an insult, and his conviction was that there were numbers of officers in the army, and other persons, who, if they had a son living, would not, for thesake of that son, accept a life peerage. Nor did he think that these life peers would, ifappomted, be at all on a par with the rest of their lordslhps Their privileges would not be equal, for the greatest privilege of a-that of hereditary succession-would be denied them; and in no other country in which such peeraces had been creatd hadtheybeen lookpedupon as conferring equal dignity. No treaise, pamphlet, or essay had ever been written upon constituteonal government (and none such could be written without noticingeseciallynthe British constitution) in which the House of Lords had not been considered as essentially hereditary in its character. That had been the hmpression always prevalent in the minds of Englshmen, and great surprise was therefore universally expressed when the idea of creatImg these lhe peerages vwas fit mooed. Atono time in English history had lfe peerages been considered as conferring equal political privileges with dignities accompanied by sutccession, He thought he could prove this by what occurred in the reign of i ag Stephen. That monary h was only a life king, and durimg his reign h conferred upon the Bishop of Lincoln a charter with certain privileges. In the third e of Edwhard the Bishop of Lmncoln was summoned to show by what right hseexe ous thoe priviletes, and accordingly put inthee charter grand by ding Stephen; but the Crown lawyers of the day argued that King Stephen, being a life jcng, had no right to alienate in perpetuity the rights and orivileg of the Crown, and hee bishop was obliged to give way. -rom the remotest times, he repeaed, an important distinction had been drawn between life and hereditary peers. h What occurred when Louis Xt I pe was restored to the throne of France ? The other day his noble friend had quoitd that agreeable historian Mr. fmacalay, and hemiyho t quoe Tfromaecontemporary writer, Mr. Afson, upon the point he had alluded to "Ai still more momentous change took place by an ordinance which appeared a few days after, on August 12, 1815, makifng the seat in the Peers hereditary which was the subject of long said anxious discussion during four days in the Cabinet. Louis XVIIIL argued strongly that in agreeingv to this change he was stripping the Crown of one of its most important,prerogatives, and of nearly all its infuence in the Chamber of Peers. 'With the influence of ambition,' said he, 'all my inftlence over the pceerage is at an end When it becomes a family inheritance Ihave no power over it. I can no longarput arnng on the finger of one of snylousehold.' Talleyrand insisted vehemently for the hereditar succession. 'Wermust haveesaidrh 'stability, we must buildfor a long future.t"h-Aeison's New Series, voLp 1, Hlef hear.) That was the opinion of Tblleyrand as to the difference between hereditary and life peerages. HIe Lord Mlalmesbury) confessed that he looked upon the late creation of a life peer with great alarm, andhie hoped their lordships, when they re-entered upon the discussion of this sublect, would bestow upon it all the care and attention which its importance deserved. Viscount DUJNGANON fully concurred in thinking that, guided by the advice of the noble marquis (of Lansdowne), thfis power of creating life peerages would be safely exercised; but the time might arrive when dangerous and r eckless advisersmight havetbeearof themonarch, andit was for such a coiqtingency that their'1ordships ought to provide. He feared, whatever limitations mlight be introduced, that toallow a peer for life to sit and vote in their lordships' house might be productive of consequences wbich, although not inmediate, would prove ultimately of great danger. He would remind their lordships of the old proverb nZsia 1 sx.stigia i-edrorsuenm, and he must express his strong convic- tion thatthe Rubicon once passed most dangerous consequences would result. In his opinion, the hope of foundiig a dynasty was an inmentive to exertion stronger far than the hope of obtaining a peerage for life; and he most aniously hoped that the subject would be approached with the greatest care and deliboration, and that the utmost caution would be employed to preserve those privileges which their lordships had always maintained. Lord BROUGHAMsI rose to express his satisfaction at the counrse which the Government proposed to adopt. He rejoiced that the controversy was now at an end on every account-on account of the country,'and on account of their lordships' House. He rejoiced, also, that the question of the app ellate jurisdiction of their lordships hadbeen entirely separated from the consideration of this subject, and he was glad to learn that, in all probability, an investigation into that question would shortly take place before a select committee of their lordships. He would abstain from touching up6n the difficulties of the task, but he would venture to express a strong hope that the decisioi to which their lordships had come on a point of constitutional law would not leaditolesation with a. view to avoiding that decisiou and creating life peerages. -The constitubion of a COUrt of appellate jurisdiction was a problem most difficult of solution as he well knewv, beth from the observations of others'and from his own experience. lord Eldon hadt deemed that some. change in the existing system was necessary, and upon two occasions when he had thorounhy considered the subject he was overcome by the dificulty of the task. Upon the formation of the Judicial Corcnittee of The: Privy Council, the sabiect of the constraction of a' court of appellate jurisdiction was 'again most carefully and. anxioaslv eonsidered, with the advice of both English and Scotchjudges; and again the great dimculties of the subject were made apparent, altlough, indeed, a tribunal was established which had, he believed, given universal satisfaction,and whichhad beenonvaionsoccasions agreatassistance to their lordships as a court of appellate jurisdiction. How much f urher that assistance might be made to extend was a subject which deserved consideration, but it ought to be dealt with most cautiously, so as to avoid in any way infringing=pon whab was one 6f the briglhtest flower. of their lordahips' privileges. He had not referred to the difficulty of a task which was to be undertaken with the view of dissuading their lordships from the attempt; but, on the contrary, he most cheerfully promised to afford all the assistanc which from his experience he min4ht be able to afford in carryingit out. The Earl of HARROVBY. did. not consider that the question of law had been satisfactorily decided by the resolution to which the Commaittee of Privileges had agreed, [An expressw.n ofdissentfromLor4CA<MPeELL.] One main elementof theirlordships'House was nodoubt the independence derived from its hereditary quality, but at the same time it was necessary to aapt themiselves to the requirements of the age. Their lordships should be careful, while looking to the advantage which 'was derived from the independence of an hereditary peerage, that they did not shut the door to the rising talent of the country. ILord CAMPBELL said, if the noble earl who had. just sat down really entertained the opinion which he had expressed, it would be his duty, not only to say "2 Not content" to the motion from the chair, but also to revise and reverse the decision at which the Committee of Privileges had arrived. He begged to tell the noble earl that, after the resolution of the committee should be adopted by the house, the question would be irrevocably settled, andl that if Lord Wenaleydale attempted to take his seat in that House their lordships would be under the disagreeable necessity of telling him that he must retire. The Earl of CAR =AIVON exprese his satisfaction that the noble and learnedl lord (Iyridhurat) had announced his intention of moving certain- resolutions with reference to the judicature of the House, because he was certain that thero ias not one of their lordships who would not rejoice to'see that constitutional trbunal placed 'upon the most satisfactory footing. While he acmowledged the possible utility of such a ste p as the Government had taken, when properly gaarded and restricted, he could.not disguise his antupathy to the mcasure in the naked, uncontrolled, and unimited form in which it bad originally been presented to them; for, although he admitted the importance of improving the appeivito judicature of the on.se, he thought that the antidoto proposed was infinitely worse than the Earl GREY did not consider that 'he was in the least bound by the opinion of the Chief Justice, for he did not look upon the' matter as irrevocably settled. He quite admitted that the resolution to which they were about to agree would remain binding until their lordships saw grounds for recalling it; but he begged to express his firm opinion that before long theywould see grounds 'o recall their determina- tion to do that which he believed to be beyond their constitutional powers and privileges. He also begged to express his opinion that those 'who dissented fron the resolution 'were not bound to divide the House. He should certainly say' "Not content" to the motion, though he should not therefore ask their lordships to divide; but he should as-ail himself of the constitutional privileze of recording upon their lordships' journals his dissent from the course which they were about to take. The Earl of DONOUGHMORE congratulated the House upon the resolution to which the committee had agreed. It had ever appeared to him that a peerage was the highest honbur which the Sovereign could confer upon a subject, and he had always thought that the great use of the exercise of the prerogative in that direction was the incentive 'which it held out to judges, generals, and admirals to perform their duties with zeal, honour, and fidelity. He trusted that if the appellate jurisdiction of the House were defective, means would be taken to rectfy it; and if that could not be done in any other way, he, for one, would not object to the creation of a few life peers, provided always that the prerogative was not abused and tho hereditary principle of the House was untouched. Lord REDESDALTF said, the jurisdiction of the House in this matter had been seriously questioned. (" Hear, hear," from Earl Gnsr.) So far from thinling that their lordships had overstepped their duty in what they had done, he believed they had acted strictly in accordance with their standing orders. Perhaps they were not aware that one of their standing orders, and a very ancient one, was to the effect that, if there was anythmng unusual in the terms of a writ, their lordships were to examine how it came to pass. It therefore appeared to him that when their attention had been called to a practice which, to say the least, had not been followed for a period of 400 fears, they 'were bound. to examine, in the worIs of thc standing order, "how it came to pass." The only case 'which could.be relied on by the Government was that of Sir .John CornewalL There was no record of the patent beyond anotice on the journals of Parliament, and it vwas clear that it followed the introducion of Sir0ph into the house. From the earIiest period the writ wImmoas was directed to " Sir John Cornewall, Chevalier," and not to Lord Farmham, which was the title he bore. The words in his patent were rather remarkable, and did not appear in any other-tanquam personas in regno i a0 s-'which clearly implied that he was a foreigner. Dngdale said nothing of the patent, although Sir John Cornewall married into the Royal family, nor was it-at all hminited in its terms. Under these circumistances, he did not thinrkit couldbe quoted as a precedent for a life peerage. Earl GRANVIELLE Aid that, although he was temptedto answer some of the arguments which had been urged that evening, particularly with regard to the submissive acoues. cence of Lord Wensleydale in the decision of the House, yet he thought he would be acting more in accordance with the spirit in which he had endeavoured to address their lordships if he declined to discuss the subject further at present. He would content himself, therefore, with thankmg their lordships for thieir genecal approval of his suggestion that they should go mto thc zonsideration of this very grave question in a perfectly fair and imlpartial spirit. With reference to the notice given by the noble earl opposite, although hc should. uot like to pledge himself as to the coursc which the Government might adopt in regard to it, he might at once say that their proceedings would he determined to a great extent by the terms of the referene to the committee. He hoped, however, that no inquirv of this sortwould beallowed to occasion anyunnecessarydely. (Hear, hear.) The Earl of DERBY then formally moved that the report of the Committee of Privileges be received and. recorded. After a few remarks from Lord Dmsn.s-, which were inaudible in the gallery, the motion was agreed to withont a division. APPELLATE JURISDICTION OF THE HOUSE. The Earl of DERBY, in fulfilment of a promise made at an earlier period of the evening, gave notice tnat on Thursday he should move for a select committee to inquire whether it would be expedient to make any, and, if so, what provision for more effectually securing the exercise of the functions of their lordships' House as the first court of appeal, and to report thereon. Their lordships ad5ourned at 7 o'clock.

At a subsequent period, Mr. ROEBUaCK gave notice that he should to-morrowr this day) as theDnoble lord at the head o the Govearment wheter he had any objection to lay on the table the names of the commissioners appointed to inquire into the report presented by Sir J. 31'Neil and Colonel TuUloch, togethervith a copy of the cormmission itself ? APPELLATE JUISDICTION. Mr. B0lVYEgave notice thsat on Thursday, the 28th mast., he wrould move to introduce a bill tv improve the ad. ministration of justice on appeal in the last resect in Great Britain and Ireland, by enabling the judges of the superior courts oflaw andequity to vote on appeals and writs of. errer before the Queen in Parlfament. TASMAIiL - MrIs. T. D1JCoMyBE said that during the last sear a committee was appointed by the iegislative Assembly of Taisania, formerly known by the namne of Van ahiemen's Land,t toeinquireito te work;ing of the convict systemn. During the progresstef the investigation the committee required the presence and evidence of the superintendent of the convict department in the colony. That oficer gso accordingiy summoned to attend, but refused, and prevented. his subord-inates also fromattending. The Assembly exercised the means vested in them to en'orce their authority, hut the Governor, Sir wh Young, seemed to have sided elito the Government of icer, and, unexpectedly and without any notice, prorogued the eIsltive Assembly; thus putting an end to the investigat on of the committee and p. vzn g the legitimate exercise of the undoubted rights of the Assembly. Hi e vished to know whether this little roup d'edat on the part of Snr oul Youm had met with the approbation of the Government; and, if not, wbat steps had heentaken inmthe case ? . . Mr. AtBUCERE said, he should be qaite radynto lay on the table papers hich would give a full explanation oef the whole of these trainsactions, as well as of the judgmcnati which the home Government had passed on the matter; but, afterswhat had ften from the hon gentleman, it would onls be fair that nshould state thefi,ts as they had realty occurred. There was, e would not say convict systemt, hut a convict establishment in Tasmania, supported almost entirely by imperial funds and under imperial manage. ment. Itvwas allegedthat there existed great abuses in the conduct of this department, d the oe executive Govern_ uent, in the first inshtce, insitAted an inquiry and took measures in consequence. The p Legislative Council of Tasmania were not satisfied, but instituted an inquiry of their ownu, and proceeded to summuon before them the o ticersof th convictestablishment. Th aGovernor, maintaining that those otficers were officers of the executive Government, anud ot of the Assemnbly, declinedtgt scnd thein before the committee. The Speakier issue-d his warrant to soummon them to the bar. They disputed the vaidityof the warrant; but surrendered by consent to a writ of Jlusesat co2i-jws, wiith a viewv of having the vaidity of the Speakers warrant tested before thelegal tribunals. Not satisfied with this, theLegislative Council issuedanother warrauttobrieg these officers to the bar of the house, whereupon the Gover- nor, apprehending someumseemspectacle of scuflinginthe streets, thought that the only means to prevent that 'wO by proroguing the Legislative Council. After the best consideration he was able to give to the -whole transaction, he had come to the conclusion that the Governor was wrong in the first instanc in not allowing the offcers to attend b- fore the committee of the Legislative Council, because the council had a right to look into any alleged grievances within the precincts of the colony; and it would have been time enough for the Governor to object :wheu the Legislative Council ehould have transgresed the proper limits of their authority and have interfered with the minagement of an establishment pail for by imperial funds, and for which the imperial authorities should be responsible. He had stated that opiion to the Governor, and he regretted that, by an error of judgment, the Governor should have put himself in opposition to the Legislative Council on that point; but, after the matter had gone to the extreme it did, he wasnot prepared to say that the Governor was wrong in proroguingthe Assembly. All he could say was, that the pap shoild be produced, and the iouse would then be able tQ forn a Judgment on the affair. As this gi ve Couacil bA ceased to exist, and asthe people o-thecolonywould-be governed by a new lSegislature, he bsted that this vunfortunate irritation wold pass aay, and that the new Lis. far as the title went, nothhwg ooula bo nioro utisfacWr or desirable, but when he got to tho details the COMPlexiOn of affais changod altogetler. & }Ji#d hoped to'beirzfIrK the Government that night goiae: intni;iu of mod4h'dt the Obijectionable dotalis of the bill,Ibut thiej ropofi6iii' contended for in the speech of" the rght hon.gA ntk tan the Vice-president of tho Boara f Trade ant iec ix put by hun upon the ntmeaur entirely diaipatedjtlt hope, and had sent hiniover a convert to the ranisof thoie oppoP'4 the biL ' With regatd to the first p]rt 6f thweilb' which related to the passing tolls, all were agie d if" when this bil was; rjected, as he trustedrit wouA b the right hon. . gentleman would. -embody those iproerhlios in a fresh measure, it would mniet with gen6eril Isup' port. To tho stcond part. of Uioe bil, however, iiiclz dealt with local dues, ho objcted aItogothe, as hi believed it to be wholly unjust. (Hear, hear.) Therowax no doubt that these dues wereo crginally granted by those who hadaright to grAntthem,andthattloaD grantshadbee confirmed by charters, by Acts of Parliamen, and in eierJ way in whch it was possiblo to givo then ;a sole antction. Bnt,'said the rightlion. gentleman, "w wiat matter your musty charters." The right hon, gentleman was aectus. tomed to tho hrabits of a country not quits so old as ours but he begged to tdlllin thit the tenure of tho property of every gentleman in that house dependedsnpon 'musty charters." (Hear, hear.) If theright hon. gentlemain railed at 4 musty charters," lie railed at thc tenure of all the property in the kingdom. (Hear, hear.) Ono of the night fion. gentleman's chief arguxments was that thee dues were not "property," but "taxes." But if this were to be-ther doctnne, it must be acted on consistently; if these dues were to bc treated as taxes, they must be ao treated throughout, and not at one time as taxe, and another as property, as convenience suited. (Hear, hear.) ',hy, then, was it that in thIe 8th clause taxes loviable by any company o-ut of the profits of which a dividend might bo paid to tho shareholders and taxes le.do'a by any private individual in exercise of a private proprietary right vere excepted from the bill? If a tak were neot ; property, on what principle did the right ion gentlemam except from his bill taxes which went into the colrers of a company pLying a dividend, nad taxes which went intd the pockets of private inidividuals. (Hear, hear.) If the rilght hon, gentleman's doctrine was good in one ca"e it ought to be good in the othe r, but in truth ho. ras afraid of hs ovwn principle, and did nmot ventare to *pply it to any ehse.but that of mutnicipal corporations. (ear, hear.) The right hen, gentleman arSced, further, that to tade a tax where no equivalent serve wasrendered was dowownright robbery. Would the right lion. gentleman then explain to the Hiouse vwhy a tax tken without equivale4 service was less a robberywhentaken by a private individual in tha exercise of a private proprietarv right than when taken by a corporation? (Hear,hear.) Was itworse for a corporation to rob than for an indiidu torob? (Hear,hear.) The right hon. gentleman's mode of carrying out his prmcipla was certainly a strange one, for while he fixed the corporation hc let the indinidual loose. Another a,rgument of tha right hon. gentlemanvwasthat the corporationsof the preent day w ere not the same corporations which ext,ted befordthe Muindpal Corporations. ct; and that the right e ahich they had to this property was not the right orioinaly cenErred, as that had been forfeited in 1b35. In that view, certainly, tho rigeht hon. gentleman differred from all the statesmen tho had been ciocerned on either side in pasing that act, and from all that he had ever read and heard on the sunbject. Hae had alwfays anderstood the princpla of that measure to be, that as through process of timc, the property which had becn intended for the benefit of the rhole municipality had, by a breac' of trust, get into a smaller end more limited ynbec of hands, it was the duty of Parliament to redress that breach of trust, and to restore to the w;hole municipallity that which had been originally intended foF them, and whichl wvas substantially their properti. (}icar hear.l This present corporate bodies wrere reahy rdtruly the old corporate bodies remodelled by Parliamnet, and at the sme time put into possession of all the property 'and rights enjoyed by the old corporations. (Hear, hear.) Bet if the taking of these toUs by corporations, without rendering an equivalent service, was a robbery,then nothing of what they had taken hitherto uider these ciremnstances could be said to belon" to them. In the case of Liverpool, the corporation Lad applied part of tho money whiclh they had taken wrongfully, according to tha right hon. gentleman, to hbilding St. George's-hall; but was the right hon. gentleman on that account ready: to take possession of St. George's-hall? (Hear, hear.) If the corporawtion had no right to the money, they certainily could have no right to the edifice they had built with it. According to the hen, and learned member for Plynouth, this wvanonly followfing the precedent of the repeal of thas corn lawvs, but that was the case of the abolition of a tam imposed on the importation of foreign corn which passed into the treasury of the country, and, moreover, ho would ask, did the Goveiment then propose to take upon themselves the mortgages of the landowners as the Board of Trade now proposed to take upon itsclf the 3nortga"es on those dues At one time it had occurred to him nihat this was a question of compensation to be settled in committee, but the right hon. gentleman had boldly avowed not only that' thero was no intention of giving compensation, hut that the Government were of opinion that tlho .nrinciplc of compensation could not be fairly appHi&d to this ca-e. There was another inconsistency to nwhich he would call the attention of the House. The righlt hon. gentleman said that it would be unjust to the public that there should ble any compensation. In the cases of Bristol and Hull, however, it -was said that therc had been . arrangenit with the Beard of Trade, Was comnemisation then unjust in all -other CDseS; nd just o Tly:iii these? The right hion, gentleman had also said that hea had preserved intact the rights of creditors. leith having beenX at one time the port of Edinburigh, the lattcr place was an eacumbrancer on the dues levied at the former to the extent of between 7,OQt. and 8,00O0L a-year. Under this bil, therefore, the rights of Edinburgh. which could do nothing forshipping, would- be preserved, while those; of Leith would be destroyed. This was a specimen of the consistency of the right hon. gentleman. It was said that this was a measure for the relief of shipping. He denied that sucl was the case. The local dues were not paid by shipping; and if they were, they were not abolshed by this measure. All that was done was eventually to give to the Board of Trade power to lower or raise tlem at its pleasure, Thu diffcetial dues were already paid by the Chancellom of tho Excbequer, and the relief as to them, instead of ibeing to the shipping interest, would be to him. Nay, more; tha shipping interest would, by this bill, be placed in a worse position than it was at present, becausa the 27th ciause empowered trading companies, and dock, ier, or harbour commissioners, to-reimburse tthemselveafor the sums withdraw n by the Chancellor of the Exchequer by an increase of the mazimumarates which they charged nupon shipping. (Hear, hear.) The real state of the case thereoreo was, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer now paiV d and the shipping did not. The Chancellor of the Exchequer was going to withdraw the money, and the shipping interest was to pay. (Hear, hear.) This was5, indeed, a ludicrous provision to be introduced into a measure brought forward with so much pomp and ceremonl as for the relief of the shipping interest. (Hear, hear.) Because he thought the bill was unjust in its principle and ixs it3 details, and, instead of relieving, would prejdirC the shinping interest, and because he believed that in its effects at would be as injurious as in its principle it was dishonest and unjust, he shonld vote against the second reaning. Mr. BAINES -should not have addressed the House had he not been requested by his constituents to support the views which they had expressed in a petition which he had had the honour of presenting. He had listened with the greatest respect and attention to tho arguments of his hon. amd learned friend the member for Stamford (Sir F. Thesiger), and to the speech of the right hon. baronet who folloved him (Sir F. Baring), and he could not help thinking that the objections which had been urged by the opponents of the bill applied rather not so much to its principle as to some of the clauses. His hon. and learned friend had said ihat to the fli-t part of the bill, which applied to the abolition of passing tolls, he hadi no objection; and in this view he had been folowede by almost every hon. member who had spoken in tbe course of the debate. That was an important principle which it war desirable to establish and carry out. The hon. ana learned nemeber for Belfast (Mr. Cairns) said that if he could be satisfied that it was the intention of the Government to. abolish these dues, he would give his support to the secon& reading of the bilL He (Mr. Baines) could assure the holn. and learned gentleman that the object was, after provisiot had been madc for the charges now existing, to get rid of these dues altogether. (Hair, hear.) tMr. CAN-s.-" The arrangement as to compensation 2l It was said that the principle of the second part of the bill was open to objection That principle, as he understood it, was, that no part of the community should be at liberty to tax other parts for purposes peculiar to itself, and in the benefit of which the parts so taxed had no siare.

LONDON, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 26. 18. In the House of Lords last night, Lord RXDESDAXi brought up the report of the Committee for Privileges on the Wensleydale Life Peerage. Lord GBANvn.E declared that the Government had no intention of dividing the House again on this question. It was right, however, that he should state that the Government found itself in a position of no little difficulty, when a large majority of the House had recorded its opinion that the Cnows was not competent to exercise -what it had been advised wvas part of its undoubted prerogative. He would only add that the Government were desirous to consider the subject in the calmest manner, and it relied on a corresponding feeling on the part of their Lordships. Lord .%mPsBBm had heard the statement of Lord GRANvThLE with the greatest satisfaction. Lord DERBY also expressed his satisfaction at the speech of the noble earl. The House had felt that it had no choice in this rmatter. This discussion had been .forcedupon them, and they had to declare aye or no whether tho prerogative of the CRoww. existed to the extent asserted. At the same time nothing could be more painful to the House than a collision with the Caoww, and the Government would find it ready to discuss any propositions which might be laid before it in the most temperate and impartial spirit. He couldnothelp thinkingnthat it would facilitate the further consideration of the question if Hati IMAESTY were to take one step in advance, and make Lord WsXstm-DAm an hereditary peer. The question of the infusion of life peerages into the house was one of great impoltance; though the Government had never precisely stated the objects for which they were proposed to be introduced, he could not help fancying that those objects migOeht be attained in some less objectionable manner. After passing in review the various classes, in society who miaht be supposed to aspire to such distinctions, the noble Lord came to the bar, as the profession which the Government had especially in its eye; and said that, not vith a view to the-profession itself, but for the sake of strengthening the appeDlate jurisdiction of the House, such a mode of streng,thening their Lordships in the discharge of their3judicial duties was not at all to his taste, and he feared the result would be that the House would be terribly lawyerridden. He would not enter at any greater length into the question at present, hut gave notice of his intention to move on Thursday fora Select Coinmitteeto considertheexpediencyof makingprovisions for the more efficient discharge of the duties of the House as a Court of Appeal. The Marquis of LANsDowNX anticipated a satisfactory and complete termination of the dispute which now engaged the attention of the House from the temperate tone which the discussion had assumed. It might be inferred from the terms of the motion of w;hich Lord DEBnY had given notice, that the adoption of some means for strengthing the appellate jurisdiction of the House was expedient, if noturgent. Nothing could be further from his intention than to impair the hereditary character of the House. That institution had no warmer supporter in the house than himself; but he confessedthat hedidnotregard such an exercise of the prerogative as was shown in the creation of a few Peers for life as attended wvith any danger to the privileges of the Hoiuse. Their Lordships should recolect that there was another prerogative growing in force every day, the prerogative of public opinion, which would be sufficient to override both the prerogative of the C.PowN and the privileges of that House if either of them were strained beyond their due limits. After some farther discussion, in which Lords MATZESIURY, BROUGirAm, COAPBEnL, GREY, GRAWv ,s and other noble Lords took part, the report of the committee wa,fibbeived. Lord DEBBy then gave formal notice of his motion for Thursday, and their Lordships adjourned. In the House of Commons, Mfr. T. DmOOmBE asked whether the conduct of Sir H. YoucE, in abruptly proroguing the Legislatiye Assembly of Tasmania, pending the sitting of a committee appointed to inquire into the working of the convict sysctem in that colony, had received the approval of HEB MEsTYSrf Government. MIr. I ABOuxanR, in reply, after stating the facts of the case, said that, on the best consideration he could give to it, he had come to the conclusion that the Governor had committed an error in judgment in putting himself in opposition to the Legislative Council on a point in respect to which he was in the wrong, and that he had stated his opinion to the GJ6overnor; but he was not prepared to express an opinion whether he was in the wrong in proroguing the Council. The reportsof the Committee of Supplyand of the Committee of Ways and Means were brought up and agreed to.- In a Committee of Ways and Means, on the motion of Mr. WiwSON, a resolution was agreed to fora grant upon the Consolidated Fund for the amount of the Supplemental Estimates. On the order for the second reading of the Local Dues on Shipping, &c., Bill, Sir F. Thsasrp moved to defer the second reading for six months. He* was justified, he thought, ia this aotion by the absolute refusal on the part of the Govewrnmctit to liste to- tho fair E&d juttvlaiiof thosse whose interests were iffected by the bill, and. by their, dette'rinatioii I 'persevere in a measure o'fraught, he; said' witli'thI, greatEtinm jutstice, sad! which tended tot shake,the security of all corporate property. -Mr. Lowf had assumed, he observed, that corporations' might lie deprived of their property by the L7isature for the benefit of the public,-.a-doctrinbwhich recalled to his mind the time when Isaults were made npon charters. But even then a pretenco at least was made of a misuse-oran abuse of chartered rights'; whereas, ' in the present instance, there'was not a single allegation of improper application of the funds, but, by a mere exertion of the power of Parliament, the property of corporate bodies was to be seized and confiscated to 'the use of the State. He did not, he said, oppose the. first portion of the bill, relating, to passing tolls, which were not private property; nor to the fourthpart, wlhich concerned charities. The secotid part proposed to transfer all rates, dues, duties, 'and. imposts upon ships and goods from corporate towns to the Customs, to be applied 'as directed by the Board of' Trads; and the third proposed entirely to abolish the differential dues, on the plea that corporate property was public property. Sir FnsEzrj6K 'istinguished between different species of corporations. One species, he argued,' consisted of those which were invested with a public trust, witho.ln any beneficial interest; and these might, ho admitted, be dealt with- by Parliament for the public 'advantaige. Other corporations were created to be the medium of conferring rights and privileges upon individuals, in which each individual possessed a right to and share in the privileges and property of the corporation. In the latter case, vith reference to the pubihc at large, the corporation had rights and property which it was entitled to possess as exclusively as individuals; yet the bill applied the same rule to both species. He then enteredintoaminute disquisition upon the cases of, Liverpool and other marine corporations affected by the bill, which lie followed up by an examination of the pre-, cedents adduced by MIr. tows, observing that the case of the Trinity-house, whicli was strictly a public corporation (no member having any interest in the funds), and that of the Municipal Reform Act-bbth of wvlich had been cited in favour of this bill-were strong cases in sapport of his argument against it. In respect, to the dues which it wvas intended to transfer to the control of the Board of Trade, the change would not be of the slightest benefit to the public, while the principle was one of most dangerous tendency. With regard to theidues to be abolished, if other corporations looked on with folded arms -while this spoil and confiscation went on, they would find, probably tothe'r cost, he said, that they would obtain only the melancholy privileg of being the last devoured. The measure, in his opinion, was calculated to take away rights secured by charters, acts of Parliament, public agreement, and immemorial possession, and thereby to undermine the security of all corporate property. Sir F. BABRnG, in seconding the amendment, observed that any one who looked at the provisions of the bill must hesitate at voting for its principle. He objected tothe second reading upon two grounds -first, because he recognized in the bill a determaination to interfere with self-management in affairs which he thought should be left to the local governments; and,' secondly, because he recognised throughout the bill a carelessness of private rights and a sacrifice of public and Parliamentary faithz. Mr. LowE, after replying to the criticisms of Sir F. B.RiUa and Sir F. ThEzisix upon his speech introductory of the bill, observed that the measure was founded upon the recommendations of a commission, and the question was how the views of the commissioners could be best carried out. This object was one of considerable difficulty, and he complained of the want of candour vith which the billhad been received, and of the hard terms of " confiscation" and " spoliation" applied to it. Sir F. ThEsIGER had dwelt, he said, much upon the term " property." What was property? He could understand property in land and property in capital; but property in other men's property he could not understand, and it was the claim to this spurious kind of property which the bill sought to transfer to the CRowN,-a proceeding supposed to endanger not only all corporate property, but all private property. Re warned those who employed this argument that, while it would not fortify corporate rights, it might suggrest to the public that~ private property rested upon 'no surer folundation than the other. If the existence of public bodies which were created for the pubEc good was not compatiblb with the public interests, it was not only -the rigeht, but the duty of Parliament to abolish them. Theywere means for the attainment of ends, and when they ceased to answer those ends they ought to give pLace to something that would answer themn. In their zeal for property the opponents of the bill, he observed, would destroy the right of property. This was not a tuere question of corporation property; it involvedthe interests of those who paid the dues; and he maintained that he it was who stood up for the principle of property, and that the opponents of the bill were really advocating spoliation. After a brief examination of the cases referred to by Sir F. T=ns1aGR, he adverted to the doctrine of compensation, contending that this was'no case for compensation, or for throwing the dues upon the community. It might be said that the injury of these extortions was sml; but there was no injury, as Mr. BEzrAgI said, the multiplication of which mu"h otmk it intolerable. mht not make Bir. HoRsFALr strenously opposed the bill. He contended that the town dues paid at Liverpool infl icted no hardship upon shipping, and enumerated the large sums which had been expended by the corporation of that port for the benefit of the general commerce of the country. In defending the corporation of Liverpool ageainst certain allegations of Mr. Lowzs, he passed some severe strictures upon that gentlemnan's published speech, insisting that his statements, as regarded IRverpool, were not founded on fact. Mr. RIDIEY likewise opposed the bill, in doing which he felt, he said, that he was defending the cause of property. He vindicated the title of the corporation of Newcastle-upon-Tyne to their town dues, wvhich were not shipping dues; the ornly dues paid to the borough fund were coal dnes. The law of property, as laid down by Mr. LowF, was not. he contended, the law 'of Great Britain, nor such as the British public would sanction. The bill, he believed, would disappoint the shipping interest, while~ it would lay a groundwork of injustice in relation to corporate property. - - Mr. TOLLEMACHE could not support the bill, although he considered that a measure of some kind was required-one that would commute the town dues for an annual sum -upon an average of years. Ifr. CoLIEa supported the second reading of the bill, which was based, in his opinion, upon the only sound theory of taxation. The principle of the bill, as he 'iunderstood it, was, that the slhpping interest' should not be' taxed by certain towns for objects from which that interest derived no advantage. It was only a corollary to the principle of free trade,-that no part of the community should tax the whole for its oown betnefit. The case of the corn laws was not so stronlg as this, for these dues were levied uponone part of the commaunity for the benefit of another part. The sole argument againct the bill was founded upon vested rights. But these municipal corporations were essentially public institutions; they existed for the whole public benefit, and the Legislature had' the right to deal with them, a right which it had exercised by the Municipal Reform Act. _ , Mr. HMIuYAs, in opposing the bill, caracteiMzd the speech of Mir. Low as a bold avowal of a disregard for the rights of private property. Such doctrines he believed, had never before been uttered from the Treasury bench. Mr. RiCE suggested various objections to the biL M. DaEEs protested against what he considered the extraordinary doctrines propounded by MIr. LowE as to the rights of property, which he thought were not likely to gain advocates of the measure. He pointed out the unfair and unjust manner in wFhich the port of Ramsgate was treated by the bilL Mr. J. C. EWART opposed the bill, which he believed to be fraught with the grossest injustice. Mr. LIDDELL also opposed the bill, although he admitted that, with much evil, it contained much that was good. -He resisted it because it conferred a benefit upon 'one part of the community at the expense of the rights of another, sweeping awvay vested rights. "Mr. IcnHAm argued that, looldng to the objects for which the corporate rights were originally granted, the change proposed by the bill might be reoonciled with a due re2ard to thoserights -ofroperty. He should vote for the seoond reading of the bill. Mr. CAMNs said hehad intendd to vote-for-the 4eeond reading of the. bill; but the speech of Mr. LOWE, and the interpretation he had put upon -the measture, had made oneconvert against it. Re;disputed the doctrine of MIr. Lowy, that a tax was not -property, and that it was robbery to take a tax without rendering an eqjuivalent, contending that it was inconsistent with his own bilL If this doctrine *as true, and the Liverpool corporation had, as alleged, spent tho money so raised improperly, the Government wculd. be entitled to take possession of -the buildings and other property into' which the corporation had converted the-town dues. 'Re pointed out other particulars which, he thought, -showed that tho measure was crude and rn-considered. Re insisted that, although the bill was said to be for the relief of shipping, the local dues did not fall upon ships, nor did the differential dues, - while new imposts were to be levied upon 'hipping. Mr. BAiEES said the objecfions offered to the bill went not so much to its principle as to various elauses. The principle of the bill mas that one part of the community shall not be at liberty to tax another part for puiposes peculiar to itself,-that is, without an equivalent. There might be cases *uder the bill which reqtured consideration, but thesecases did not touch the principle. On the questioni of property he contended that betwreen property of such corporations as those under considerationand that of individuals there was a dishtnction which had been recognized again and again by the Legislature; and Sir F. TnnswErt tacitly admitted the distinction when ho consented to the abolition of passing.tolls. Sir F. KsLLY reiterated the objection that the principle of the bill was to take from corporations property which was theirs by law, and was held in trust for the inhabitants. He insisted not only I upon the injustice of the measure, but upon the serious effect which it would have upon the vast amount of property purchased by these ceorporations, and upon the claims of the creditors of'those bodies. On the motion of M1r. W. S. INmDSAY, the debste was adjourned (after some discussion) until this day. TPhe Prisons (Ireland) Bill was read a second time. The Delamere Forest Binl was read a third time and passed. MIr. WmX'sma's Irish Court of Chancery Bills were read a second time, and referred to a Select Committee. The ATToRo-GESRAL obtained leave to bring in a bill to explain and amend the act 18th and 19th Vivror&, for the better local management of the metropolis. Sir B. ELH L moved for a Select Committee to consider the best means of communication between those parts of the metropolis -which lie north of St. James's Park and those parts which lie south and south-west thereof, and to report thereupon to the House. I An attempt was made to defer the motion. but, after a short discussion, in the course of which Lord PALmErtsToo stated that no particular line had been contemplated, the motion was agreed to. MIr. Wrsox (for Mr. HRosirmz) obtained leave to bring in a bill to abolish the office of Secretary to the Poor Law Commissioners in Ireland. The remaining business having been disposed of, the House adjourned at 10 minutes to 1 o'clock.
We have only to live long enough, and we shall all get young in time. The oldest members of the House must have felt the young blood in their veins as Sir F. TnxEssiGx repeated on the Corporation Tolls Bill the arguments by which Parliamentary Reform, Municipal Reform, and a dozen other reforms were resisted a quarter of a century ago. Everybody in those days had a " pro" perty' in the Englishman. The boroughmonger had a vested interest in his political representative; the Mayor and Aldermen had an indefeasible right to dine out of him twenty times a-year; the Established Church could make an assignment' of his conscience, or exchange it for commissions in the- army and navy; the paupe. held his charity in fee; and really there 'was not a . part, or quality, or an attribute of the man that had not some parasitical tenant in possession. You went about not only with an Old Man of the Sea on your shoulders, but clogged in every limb, like the giants who exhibit themselves carrying a ton or two distributed over their bodies. There was no power of fixing and outgrowing the incubus. It grew with your growth, and strengthened with your strength. Had the Reform 33ill never passed we shoud have been considering at this moment whether or no to purchase Old Sarum for half a million; and, had our corporations remained as they were, we should have had to pension out " six clerks" in every borough in the kingdom. It is just such an incubus that is proposed to be thrown off by the Bill for Dealing with the Local Dues on Shipping, except that the most monstrous grievance applies only to two or three localities. The Corporation of Liverpool levies considerably more than a hundred thousand a-year on all goods entering the Mersey, and applies the money to any purpose it pleases-for example, to the building of a magnificent hall for concerts and other miscellaneous purposes. A ship may not enter a dock or approach a quay; it may not even come near the Liverpool side of the MIersey; it may go straight to the rival docks of Biilrenhead; nevertheless, the Corporation of Liverpool claims a property in its cargo, and exacts a percentage, to be applied, not to improving the channel of the MIersey, but to any purpose of business or pleasure it may choose. It has a right, it says, in that c6rgo-a property as substantial and indefeasible, according to Sir F. THESIGEF, as the landowner in his estate that has conme down from the Conquest, or the fundholder in the Consols he has bought with his money. In every ship whatever, in any part of the world, the Corporation of Liverpool claims a contingent property-that is, contingent on its coniing within certain maritime lines. If the ships coming within those limits increase from a hundred a-year to. a hundred thousand-if the proceeds of the tax increase from 5,0001. to 5,000,0001., it is all the same. The Corporation has a right to it, and may use it to pave its streets with gold, to build' a dozen halls and cathedrals, to rebuild the whole city, to do everything it pleases, in reason and out of reason. That is the property asserted by Sir F. THESIGEn- The pretensions we had to dispose of twenty years ago could boast a respectable antiquity. At a0l events, there was this in their favour,-that, however extravagant their demand, though it went to the entire government of the empire and an absolute authority over our pockets, our loyalty, and our consciences, still there was no question abouit the persons or the bodies who made these demands. The charters or the titledeeds were five centuries old or more, and, though somewhat at variance with the spirit of the constitution, might almost clain to be older than it. The :British people accordingly paid them the same sort of deference that the younger members of a family do to an imperious old dotard, for whom they cannot help feeling a sort of superstitious, but not very hearty respect. In the present instance, on the contrary, the pretenders against Parliament and the people, as M1r. LOwE pointed out last night, are the creatures of Parliament and the people. They are the veriest infants of legislation-the mierest novelties of history. Made by Parliament, and having receivLed from Parliament every sixpence, every right they possess, they rise agahist Parliament and dispute its paternal authority over its own children. The Liverpool Corporation has no more identity with the corporation that bought the duties in question 200 years ago than the Metrolpoitan BoZA-Vt
Those have been mistaken who expected that the meeting of the American Congress would be the signal or the cause of a national outbiust of hostility to England. It woould now appear that the means of constitutionally expressing opinion has acted as a safety-valve to the passions of the republic. The orations in the Senate are hardly what we should call pacific. MIr. SawARD was for imnnediate notice of expulsion by force of arms, General Cmss was warlike as ever, and thc most moderate onlyadvocatedthe abrogation of the wvhole treaty, a return to the state of things which preceded its signature. and then the adoption of the most advantageous policy, that of -masterly inactivity or tacit acquiescence in forcible colonization by Americans being generally preferred. However, it is admitted on all hands that the debate is little regarded. If the speakers are interested, the readers of the speeches -are not, and as for listeners they are few in number. Thiis question of Central America, which we in this country looked upon as important through a belief that Americans held it to be so, has now shlunk to the proportions of a common party contest. WVe had expected that, whatever might be the justice of the question, the whole American public v.ould cheer lthe sentiment of "Our country, " right or wronrg," and that there would not be wanting those who would utter the sentiment for the sake of the cheers. Under a decent disguise it may he said that more than one speal-erhas declared himself in favou'rof such anultra-patriotiepolicy; but it cannot .be said:that thepublichas eitherapplaiuded or believed him.. General OAss and Mr. CLAxroN express the opinions that might be expected from them, and we are told that there are some -who go even further than these,but the outer world seems to be very well represented by 1r. WmsoN, of 3Massachusetts, who says that he ." gives little heed to "the apprehension of war with England; mer"chants continued their trading without any "fears. 16 was not probable that the Executive "desired a war. The only result obtained by "the CrAxTo.?i-BrLwEF treaty hnd been a prolific "correspondence and an interminable discussion, "which had settled no point in dispute and led to " no result." e. advises the complete abrogation -of the treaty,-a course with respect to which- each man i5 at liberty to have his opinion. There seems to gain ground a feeling that the literal sense of the treaty justifies England in retaining all that she possessed. It seems impossible to deny that, by direction of Lord IPArLxrE;Tow, Sir R. BuLwER represented to the American Government, prior to the signature of the treaty, that 'England was in possession of the island of Puatan; that ft was occupied by British settlers, and governed by a British magistrate ;'and that, therefore, the settlement of Asnericans as an independent community could not be puzmitted. If, -with these facts fresh in the memory of the negotiators, a treaty was signed withotit a stipulation for the abandonment of the island, it seems natural to conclude that the sense of the agreement was that England should retain her rights. Though it is little to the credit of tLe two diplomatists that 'we should have to interpret their production as if it were the will of some obstinate old man who chose to he his own lawyer, yet, if the two nations nre to settle their rights according to it, it must be examnined by {he aid of every light that can be thrown upon it. The Americansseem now to feel this; 'and to admit that by the terms of- the treaty Englaln hasa fair show of right. Of course, the nest thing to be done by the more impatient i3 to attac&- ISM. CLAYTON;, and declare that he was outwitted by Sir H. BaEB.wm We do not believe this, inasmuch as it is just as easy for us English f6 proclalm the 'cnierse, 'ai vituperate our o representative. 'T heT matter eems siply s- that the two Ministers made a treaty which was unintentionally'ainbiguous,'anad when we remember that two years 5ince, in ' far more importait matter, the greatest iamesof European diplomacy, assembled in the'very capital of -the art, produced a documnent which would have had the very contrary result to that -intended, we' cannotw vonder that similar stipulations shoulda have omitted- reference to details apparently so trifling as the retention of Ruatan or the suzerainty of Mosquitia. -Now, therefore, that - the treaty has been examined and found to be ambiguous, now that it appears to even the most touchy citizen that EnglInd has fair grounds for her own construction, the natural reult is to diminish w;hatever rancour may have mixed with the dispute. If a document is to be interpreted, let it be referred to some competent authority. The history of the origin of wars would no doubt reveal many absurdities, but certainly none could be greater than that two nations should solemnly make:a treaty, and, when it was found unintelligible, then fight to support their respective interpretations. This feeling, coupled with the fact that the long-expected debate in the Senate throws no new light on the matter, has caused public feeling to subside from. irritation to calnness; and even to indifference. As we in this country often see an agitation. shrink- to insignificance on the meeting of Parliament, so the loud words and threatening 'manifestoes of certain politicians seem now almost forgotten. The debate in the Senate has, at any rate, placed the question on its true grounds. It is made plain that the matter in question is the interpretation of a treaty, and that if that treaty was ill framed the American Government bears its part in the blame. It is also seen more clearly that much of the indignation expressed by certain men in office was affected for political purposes. It was hardly so much their country's interest as their own that they had in view when they asserted that England, without grounds, and even 'withoit pretext, had attack-ed the settled policy of the States. We may learn from the long contest for Speaker in the HEuse of Representatives how fully the Americans felt that no danger threatened their country. No spirit of faction would have prevented them from maling their cloice within an hoiur, had they believed that the safety or even the' dignity of the States was imperilled. The general expression of feeling, both by Senate, Representatives, and people, is to the effect that no cause of quarrel really exists, and that whatever is in dispute may be settled as disputes should be settled between friendly nations. iNo one can have considered the matter without clearly seeing that halfan hours conversation, inspired by a real wish for agreement, would suffice to end the bickerings of months. Therefore Congress, which represents very fully the heart as well as the head of the American people, does not seem at all irritable. It is, indeed, a new proof of the capacity of popular assemblies to discuss the most delicate concerns of a nation when we find how little a dispute - fanned by' the intriguing spirit of -politicians fails to embitter assemblies chosen by such extended suffrage as those forming the American Congress. Both Senators and Representatives would, we doubt not, resist with spirit a real injury; but no official persuasion can make them believe that an ambiguous treaty was a perfidious plan of England, or that in keeping up a station at Ruatan, and cutting mahogany on the' Honduras coast, this country is intent on seizing the key of the Pacific, .and limiting the natural growth of American power. In short; the question is seen to have been misundersto-od by the people as much as by their diplomatists. Every citizen is aware that we have no wish-to fight for Ruatan, or even mruch desire to possess it; he also knows that America could gain nothing by even the most fortunate war in comparison to the advance made in a single year of such peace'and prosperity as she enjoys at present. Both as regards the enlistment question and its imaginary affront, and the Nicaraguan dispute with its contested details, every man feels that trifling causes of quarrel have wrongly received importance when affairs of much greater weight demand the attention of either nation.
Death is the last punishment which the justice of man can award to the greatest criminaL W'hen the moment of enforced agony is over, and the guilty spirit is dismissed to the judgment seat above, there is an end of all vindictiveness and all animosity. There must, however, be no confusion of the eternal difference between right and wrong, no maudlin palliation of great crimes, because the best among us have often tripped and sometimes sinned. Let us at least abhor vice if we do not always avoid it. Let us, indeed, be sterner critics upon ourselves than upon our fellowcreatures; but no false commiseration or comiplaisance should bind uIs to silence when a country is startled with the rumour of a great crime because the criminal has expiated his guilt by a violent death. Our readers must have already perceived that we are speaking of the suicide of JoHN SADarEs It is not for the Durpose of denouncing the individual, nor of g,ivig additional publicity to his disgrace, that these observations are intended. The fact of his violent and horible death and the history of his crimes are already so notorious that nothing we can say could add to his dishonour. If we remark upon* the tragical end of his career at all, it is as a protest against that fearful spirit of speculation which is the vice of our times; it is that others may see in his fate something alkin to that which awaits themselves when they are driven to the end of their shifts and contrivances-when they have exhausted the suggestions of cunning and the resources of crime. Thebankrupt's despair, thefelon's cell, the cold bed of the suicide on the damp moor, must be reached at last, the fitting termination to a life only supported by the plunder and misery of others. Jorn- SADiarn does not stand alone in his guilt and inhis shame. The criminal records of the last year can show the names of men who stood as high or higher in the world's eye, but, of whom we now forbear to speak, from very pity for their fallen estate. Hundreds, we fear, of persons in this metropolis, and in the larger mercantile towns of the Idngadom,a ie now engaged in the same perilous traffic. 'It needs but a reverse and an opportunity, and why should they hesitate to follow in the footsteps of the most keen-witted and umscrupulous of their predecessors? The proceedings of the adjourned coroner's inquiest, which -we publish this day, do not throw -mnuch additional light upon the nature of the embarrassments which drove JoniH SAD= to despair. Letters of his, written a few hours before he sallied out on his fatal expedition, were produced, but they infoim us of little beyond what was alreadyknown. This is their general tenour :-" I cannot live. I hav'e "ruined too many. I could not live and see their "agony. I have comraitted diabolical crimes "unknown to any human being.- They will now "appear, and bring my family andothers to distress, "shame, and grief that they should ever have "known me. I blame no one,: but attribute "all to my own infamous villany." Such, as will be seen by our report of this day, is the general tenour of these letters, which are written in a spirit bidsring on dis on; Itis, how-^' ever, sad to know that the self-accusations are not' the mere suggestions fa diseased brain. It'istrae that the writer was guilty of diabolical crInes: it is true that he has swindled and -forged; to a~ fearfal extent; it is to :be feared-as he himself1 says-that' he has- been, the causo' of permanent misery to thousandsof 'iMoJfending people. L et us' not deceive ourselves, nor, out, of false pity for the: wretched 'author of allT this' sorrowt, endeaiourto palliate; the-. atrocity of Ihis ' acts. If -the heinousness- of crimes bhe measured by their consequences, the man who carries disaster, if not atbsolute rnin,' into is hundred families' -is stainred vrith deeper guilt than, the mere mffian4who attacks life. The. report is that, when the full extent of his villanies is known, it w'ill be found that, in one form oranother. he has swindled the public to an' armount little short of half' a million. It would seem marvellous to those who have not been under the unfortunate necessity of watcling thq eourse of niodern speculation how a man who, probably, started, in the 'rorld without any fortune. at aU could involve himself and others to such an extent. In' SADIESs case, however; it must be considered tlhat, independently -of the ordinary resources of the speclaatdr,'"he was' enabled, from his official position, to commit riany crimes without 'fear 'of " inmediate discovery which another man could' not have attempted without instant detection. It would be as. yet prematu re to suggest any precise estimate as the limit of his defalcations. : When hi'nian is'in a position to forge title-deeds, railway shares, and mortgages to an indefinite amount, there need be little limit to his operations. He is also charged with having fraudulently assigned away deeds held in trust by him to an cno rmous amount. As a forger he seems to have been remarkably successfuilf and t is said that the signatires iif the' Irish' Encumbered' Estates' Ccmmissioners have been.so skilfully executed that n6 one, however familiar with their handwriting, could distingtuish between the forgeries and the genuine signatures. At the close of last week it was added that 'iany forgeries on private individuals hadc been already made out, and that the discovery of many more was anticipated. On the whole, this seems the greatest crash mnade by any single individual in recent times. We purposely avoid dealing with what m.ay be caUled the " picturesque"' features of this remark-. able case. We have no wish to dwell upon the despair of the detected forger, and Iiis last ghastly walk to the heath wlhere he was about to lay d6wn his life."' Burglary and murder have been made "interesting" ere tlis, but let nothing of this kind be attempted now. We would wish to hear the crimes of JoHN A.kDLEIR spoken of with wholesome and universal abhorrence, but let even indignation spare his unhonoured grave; let there be no morbid dwelling upon tle last scenes of his life nor upon his closing agony. He has already appeared at the bar of that AIAIrimHv JUDGE before whomi we must all of us one day stand ; to 'that tribunal let him be left. If word of ours would avail, woe would deprecate all further and uinnecessary prying into the secrets of the family even by the Coroner and his jury. It is surely prored that Jouin SADLSi died by his owvn hand, being unable to bear the shame of exposu-re and the consequence of 'his crimes.' 'What has the public to do with the -distracted letters addressed by the suicide to his relatives in the last moments of his career?' One sentence from these contains the whole moral. of his gutilty life and tragical death:-" 07b! tat I '7hd resisted the "frst attempfs to lMunch, me P iwto speridatio !" There are many of the English public wrho wtould do ivell to lay seriously to heart' the dying wiords of JoN- SADLEsn.

The follovwing is the letter of ourParis'correspondent, dated jesterday, 6 p.m. The incpbrtant moment has arrived at last. The Congrcss;has' conunenced its sittings. -For weeks to .come thirs. city, in whlich that international jury is assembled, to .decide. the great political question of the day, Mill have the attention of Europe directed toit. BMany a wistful eye has turned forthelastsix hours to that stately edifice,, the'rotel of Foreixn Affairs, where the deliberation of that momentous subject has already opened, as if it wvould fain peneh-ate its massive walls for one glihmpse of what is going on within.' The services of those singularly gifted persons,, the force of whose visual organ penetrates the thickest millstone, would beinvaluable just now. With -what sort of aspect did the Plenipotentiaries first meet? 'Were their faces beaming over with diplomatic smiles, or did their eyes glance sternly as they stood before each other in that well carpeted, well tapestried, wel furnished, and, alas! 'too well closed apartment? Did the Russian, fiesh from the ice of the Neva, maintain the cold hauteur of the vanquished but still haughty enemy? Or did his frigid heart melt and expand -before the warm courtesy of his southern confr6res ? I DidIthe Plenipotentiaries, on cromsing the threshhold of the hall of the conferences, lay aside the habits of sociai amenities, and assume all the rigidity of diplomacy ? Did they fold their arms as they thought of the Redan and the Mfalalkhoff, of Sinope and Sebastopol, and of all that happened since last they gathered together? Or' did they, like courteous combatants, who respect each other's prowess, shake .hands, to show they had ino personal spite before "setting to " -at this fresh encounter of wits ? All this, and more than this, is asked ; but there is no one to answver. All is' silent about that bwHdil7g. Not a man issues from it without wearing an expression of mystery on his features. The sable-dlad ushers who wait in the ante-room are more impressive, solemn; and taciturn than usuial; and the plated chains which, Lord Mayor-like, they vear as insignia' of office, clank with a more subdued sound. The gargons du bureau., - usually so good-natured, so alert, and so bustlin'g, now steal| stealthily alolng. The very sentinelsaf the external doors stand motionless like armed statues; anda even the barges on the rivet which flows before the wvalls of that fair Palace glide noiselessly up and dowFn, for fear a ripple should disturb the silezice. The Russians were at their worl early this :morning.' Baron lrulnow was stirring betimes, and M M. Seebacl was seen to issue from his house some time 'after 8 o'clock, and accompany his friend to the residence of -the chiel Plenipotentiary, Count Orloff. The three 'Were for hours closeted together, and ino doubt " got up"' their lesson well before starting for the rendezvous. The spirits of 'people in general seem to be elated, and confidence in the pacific result of the Conferences is gaining strength, on what particular ground I cannot find out, except that at the Tuileries last night the Emperor was very gracious. He chatted in an animated manner with his guests, smiled giuceftully with Count Buol and Baron Brunow, and the sterner Orloff was heard to dechlre that notlhing could be -more satisfactory than the Emperor's reception of him; and Eis Majesty is said to have looked the very picture of peace. If you can believe what you hear in public, almost every difficulty is already removed, the task left to the diplomatists is of the lightest possible kind, and 'the wonder is how they will manage to occupy even the first week of their meeting. This is the very exuberance of optimism. I do not mean to say that p3ace will not be the result of the Conferences, but I should hesitatebefore pronouncing it as certain. There are, so far as I can understand, serious matters yet to be discused, but which will be successfully got over if France, England, and Auistria remain firm and united to the last moment. If they do so Russia has no alternative but to yield, for ths simple reason that she cannot help herself. She is desirous of peace because she is anxious' to attend to her internal concerns, to the improvemient of her means of communication fromi the centre to the extremities of her Empire, that if she be engaged hereafter in such a war as the present her -armies may not perish on their' way to encounter their enemy. I will not trouble you with the various rumours that' have been fJying; about during the day, as none of themA rest on any authenticatedcfact. I persist in what I have already said with respect to the issue of the conferences, that no safe opinion can be formed "till after the iapse of eight orten days. I may say, however, that probably not much time will elapse before the preliminaries are signed, and that probably an a^rmistice will be proclaimed in elediately. * The following private letter has just been re- ceived:-,I ceved. "STOCKHOL, FEB. 12. 44 Public opinio4 throughout Europe seems to have undergone such a sudden and unaccountable change that yon probably nillbe surprised to hearz that there is one remote corner of the globe where some doubts are still entertained concerning the sincerity of Riusia, some apprehension still felt that'peace on any conditions may not be for the future advantage of the civilized lworld. We see the press of France and Austria veer round from doubt to the utmost confidence, from animosity of the bitterest character tofeelingslittleshort of admiration and gratitude for the Emperor Alexander; but we, cold-blooded northems, are more difficult of persunsion. "We see niany questions mooted, none resolved; many great interests at stake, none really secured. Is the acceptance of the four points the only resmt of this great war? Are the arsenals of Cherson andNicholaieff to remain unmolested? Is the Russian Government still to oppress the Circassian tribes, and to command the high road tolIndia ? " These questions are daily put by our press, and I would fain addressthem to you. I say nothing about our own position, which I lave so often explained to you; it is now' clear that the Scandinavian question has been cast aside as a superfluous weight in the general steeple-chaseafterpeace, but it may interest you to hear something of the giautworls now carrying on at Cronstadt. "You are probably awarethatby next spring the Russian! steam fleet will consist of 18 line of battle ships and frigates 14 corvettes, a 70 gun boats, which formidable force may ride secure behind an inpassable barrier, and defy the nDited navies of the world, thanks to the fortifications planned by Admiral Schanz, at which 30,000 men are now working under his direction. This formidabla work consists ina triple row of piles 4ght across the Gulf of Finland, abon six miles from Cronstadt, and should the ice be strong th's spring it maybe finished thisyear.

The mnost absolutte order and tranquillity plevailed in alU tlie Saidji s subdued by Itissia in the course of the last campaign. Some disturbances, however, had occured in thoe Sandjak of Ghoel, situate to the horthof ayars. Aslam Pasha lard his brother, Iser--Bek, at the head of 400 men, excited: a revolt in the district, and occupied the villages of- Seinot, Rhorovanha, and TehoulPenel. The Yessaoul Koulgatcheff- marched against them vith theee sotnias of Cossacks and four batteries of artillery, surprised the Tnrks, who were quietly established in the above villages, and eompletelyroutedthem. The insurgents lost GO L-illed and 10 prisoners. The Cossacks had but one man illed and four wounded. That engagement took place on the] st January. The festivities of Christmas and the Nowv Year (13th January) wvere celebrated at Kars -with an unusual solemnuity for the Tuirks, who assisted at thus. On the' eve -of the Nev Year Colonel Loris 3Ielikoff, the Covernor, invited to supper the principal Russian officers and functionaries, as also the mnembers of the 31edjIls, o. Ottoman Court of Civil and Criminal Justice. The repast lasted till after midnight. Toasts were proposed to the Czar, to his Lieutenant-General 1Iouravieff, and by the Tuurkish Cadi to Colonel Loris liclikoff."' - The beneficial effects' of the resolution of the Banrk of France to discount commercial bills at 90 days, are already ble,uin-ing to be felt in Paris. The retail trade, h6wever, has not yet recovered any very great activity: but the shopkeepers are fast preparing for, sprinig, and, in anticipation of peace, laying in a larger and more v'aried stock than usual. Numerous French and foreign commission I agents have arrived, and given important orders to Parisian manufacturers, -wh6 are nowv busily attwork. The Russian merchants, on the other hand, have' not awaited the conclusion of peace to renew their former relations with French houses, but their demands are merely conditional, and to be executed only in the event of the re*establishment of peace. The accounts from the industrial districts are most satisfactory. At Rouen buyers are very nmuerous, and goods are now disposedt of by the manufacturers at'remunerative prices. At Mulhouse thansactions sre likewlise very,brisk. Wool maintains a high price, which is likely to increase still more, in consequence of the scanty supply ofjthe manufactLres. The sale of raw silk is very active in the Drome and Ardache. The decline which lately mauifested itself in the price of corn has been once more checked in Paris, owing to a slight rise inthe provineial markets. Business, however, has been extremely limited. The best sorts of flour sold at from 95f. to 9Gf. per sack of 157 ldlogrannues, but good ordinary flour ciould be had at 92f. 50c. and 93f. The reserve on Saturday amounted' to 38,354 nietlicaI 41iintals. On that day prices became rather heavy on receipt of a'telertaphic despatch from Ohartres, where wheat had fallen If. per hectolitre. In Brittanythe decline in the price of cattle continues, and the aclvices from most of the markets indicate a downward tendency. The wine merchants at Bercy still keep up their prices, but it is very probable that they will soon be obliged to make concessions, as rates are looking down and sales becoming difflcult in the vine districts. Brandyhas fallen in Paris from 165f. to 158f. per hectolitre, and spirits extracted from beet from 103f. to 95f.

Unger,.one of the most intelligent and popular professors at' the Vienna University, whose name must be well known to all European students of botany and geology, has been denounced; by the Vienna Chuirel Gakzte as a man who brings forward doctrines which do notegree with the Holy Scriptires. The students, who were excessively indignant that such a charge should be brought n.gainst thelearned professor, sent a deputation to the Minister of Public Instruction, and that high functionary was assured that the Reverend Sebastian Brunner, the author of the article in the C(hurch Gaefe, had asserted the thing which was not.

BE1tLTh, FImB 24.- One oe the most satisfactory featuies of: tihe Russian press during the last fetfdays, or to speAk more correctly, the press of the last d'utes that have come to hand, is the circumstance that' a number of official documents that have been published of late with reference to the navy, tSic Black Sex and the Sea of Azoff are no longer men tioned. This looks hot only as if the Governraeit recognized the destruction of the Black Sea fleet, and the dispersion of the small remnant of its crews still extant, not only as fait accotpTi, but as orie on wvhich the Conferences in Paris are about to impress the stamp of permanence. In the draft of 'the budget for this year, for instance, there is mzention mnade of only 53 auditors at different ports, and they are all exclusively in the Baltic, tale 'White Sea, the Caspian Sea, and the Eastern Ocean; the two seas in the south are left unprovided for. An rulase ordains that the surplus of the dues paid by inierchant vessels in tbe harbourx of Ale+angel shall be applied to the further fortification~6f the banks of the Sievernaia Dwina. The marh e school for the orphans of officers of the late Black Sea fleet, wvhich at the time of,the Emperor's receltt visit to Nicholaieff -was projected for establishrneit tlhere, is now to be transferred to Relsingfors, aid only one department is to be retained there for the instruction of pilots or mnasters of merchsntaien. -,Kothing transpires as to -whether the building of' thle screw ship of the line Witiaz at Nicholaieff is to be stopped or continued; nor has any edlict, or offici-l instruction appeared to countermand the calling out of the Marine Guard, that was to be conceatratedi St. Petersburg, Cronstadt, Sweaborg, and Revel about the end of March. The official journal c.f Finland states that the exportation of meats, fresh, salted, or smoked, over the European frontier of tlhe Empire is prohibited by land and water tiU fnrther orders. In? the columns of the Wojewot Lisfol. (Military Journal) are to befound officialdata as to thestrength of the late Black Sea Fleet, which. as being official, -will have a certain historical interest of authlenticity. According to these the Russian Pontus Fleet cohsisted of 4 ships of the line, of 110-120 -euns; 12 ships of the line, of 80-100; and finally;'2 reserve liners, of SO guns; altogether 18 ships of the line, carying 1,628 guns. Of frigates there were 12 of 52-56 guns, together with about 40 sailinig vessels of 10 gurs eacb, and 15 war steamers. Tlte total force of the Russian -war fleet in the 3Black Sea consisted thus of 85 vessels of all rates, mountia 2,800 guns. The entire commercial fleet that Russia possessed- in the Black Sea has been destroyed, with the excepfion of 11 vessels still lyiig at Odessa, some 20 odd at Yicholaieff and Cherson, and 20 odd that hare taken refuge up the Don. The craft destroyed in the Sea of Azoff are stated to ha've amounted to several hundreds. The last reports sent in by Prince Laban6ff Rostowski, from Genitschi, state that the fortification erected for the security of the place itself, and"of the bridge, are now complete, and that an energetic resistance -can be offered to any attack that may be made on that point. The Emperor has ordered that the two Granad Duukes, Nicholas and Michael, shaUll at once eftter upon theirrespective functions, the for-mer as3 I- spector of Engineers, the latter as Mlaster of the Oranance. General Dhn, of theEnugineers, and General Korff, of the Artillery, have been associated wit-h the two Grand Dlukes in these offices under the title of Assistants: It will be the duty of the latter-4, to be present wvhen the different chefs of the stiff and directors report to the Grand Dukes on the matters concerning their branches of the service; 2, they are to express themselves as to the best methods of overcoming any difficulties- thit may arise in the service; and 3, in the case of absence or indisposition of the Grand Dukes they ale to act as their deputies. In a word, the tiwo Genierals are to have aU the trouble and the responsibility of the offices, and the tvo Grand Dnkes the credit of managing the departments, the titullar heads 6f 'which they will be.

TUIKEY. ({nw oUR OWN COOERv.PNDOENT.) . . 0 ptio of tfolOwing appered fix our second ei- W of yWp--dy -,] CONSTAITLNOPLE, FZB. 14. On Tuesday afternoon last the sound of 19 guns sanounced to the population of Constantinople that te Turkish Plenipotentiary for the conferences at Pinr was leaving the capital. Aali Pasha emu,arked on board the French frigate San6, and not on board the Ajaccio, as had been at first decided. NE took with him the results of the preliminary :onferenee held here, the project for the regnlatoion of the Principalities, and the firman establishag perfect equality between all subjects of the Porte. As regards the latter, the Minisry sucteeded in getting the, Sultan's sanction without say consultation of the Great Council, so that this .iportant matter, touching so closely all the vital Interests of Turkey, has been settled in a furtive "tr and by underhand influence. - . Tho responsibility which the Ministers have thus taken upon themselves is not slight, indeed they feel it strongly; hence their hesitation at having the firman, according to their promise, read n1 published all over the empire. The first day :ixed upon for its reading at the Porte was Tuesday last; now it has been again delayed to Sunday :next, and who knows whether it will take place then! -But, whenever this happens, they may be lure to encounter great opposition, and it is very much tobe doubted whether a measure decided upon In such a clandestine manner will ever lead to any eealIy practical results. Nay, it is very Ekely, in She large margin left to the Turkish Government in the realization of these general principles of equality, tat the present Government wants to escape from She scrape. It hopes to convert the firman, like 2ny of its predecessors, into waste paper, and thfa to "dodge" the allied Powers, as it has " dodged" the nation. For such clever diplomatists as Turkish Ministers wre, whohavehad, moreover, for the last 25 or3O years continual practice in the art of coumterbalancing one foreign influence by another, such a course does naot offer great difficulties. The rights of the Christians are to be placed under the safeguard of &a the contracting parties, and between five or six of them there wil be always at least two or three who will take an opposite view of any complaint which nmay be bronght forward of some non-observance of the conditions laid doun in the firman. Indeed, I know, from a very reliable source, that in the private councils held at the Porte when the points of the *rman were discus-sed such a course of policy wzas hinted atverydistinctly, and, as its excuse, the pres- Mre was alleged wvhich, under existing circumstances, the allied Powers were able to exercise inthe mutter. The surprising thing is that the foreign Ministers did not see this back door when the Turkish GoVerlment acquiesced so readily in all the extra'agant demands which were made upon it, and 'Which the Ministers themselves only put for'ward in order to get some moderate concessions. If the alies wanted only to give a proof of their power to make the, Turkish Government accept and the Sultan sign anything they liked, they have completely succeeded; but if, as is more probably the cae, they really wished the welfare and improvement of the Christian population and the consolidation of the Turkish empire, they took the wrong way. Any real improvement in the condition of the 2ion-Mahomedans can only take place by a gradual demolition of the prejudices which exist against them in the minds of the ruling race; and, on the other hand, by ajust and gradual elevation of 'the Christians. This process had already begun. The abolition of the Spahiliks and Beyliks had paved the road for it. It was the deathblow of the old mfilitary institutions on which the Ottoman empire 'was based, and with its fall the superior agricultural 2nd inidustrial talents of the Christians came into play. The MIahomedans began to understand that the mword wasno louger the lawgiver, and that those who did not wield it were nothing better than slaves. The regulations of the Tanzimat, hovwever indifferently executed, and the consular power, however injudiiously abused, in many instances did a good deal to facilitate this process of gradual approach between the ruling and the subject castes. Nobody who has isited the interior of Turkey at the interval of even a few years could mistake the changes which were daily taling place in this respect. There were, no doubt, single cases of injustice and violence, but it 'Was nearly always the fault of some corrupt Government official who tried to " make hay while the sun was shining," and the shifts and conutivancea which he had to adopt in order to escape punishment did perhaps more than anything else to impreas the Mahomedans with the idea that the time had passed when such things could be done with impunity. Had the representatives of the allied Powers, in-tead of listening only to the cases of abuses, 'watched attentively this gradual change which wVa working in the minds of Mahomedans and Christians, a great deal might have been done under the circumstances. The ground was broken for it; the mistalke was that they wanted to sow the most perfect crops before the stones and thistles 'were effectually removed. The result will be that a reaction wil take place, and the old feeling of repulsion and antipathy between the two elements be rewived. Mforeover, from the illegal manner in which the concessions have been carried by the Ministry, a religious feeling will be mixed up with the question, 'which, by a little management, could have been altogether avoided. The relative position between fahomedans and Christians had altogether lot its original character of a religious difference, and sasumedl a political one-namely, that of the ruling and subject races. The present war is proof of this; on the Danube the Christia fought as .Yolunteers side by side with the Turks; in Albania the Chimariotes were as zealousas any Mahomedans in putting down the insurrection of their co-religionjati, without being even conscious of the difference of religion which existed between themt and their comrades. By forcing down their throats immoderate prelensions the Mrahomedans are driven to take refuge Behind their religion and fanaticism. Besides this, they begin to ask already, " Why did we go to war? Was it not because Russia wished =s to sign a treaty which would give her a right of interference with the internal affairs of Turkey? And Russia asked no new* rights for the Christians, but only the maintenance of the old ones, and was at last satisfied, notwith a treaty, but *with a simple note, while the allies ask ten times more, and insist on a solemn engagement, signed by all the great Powers." One of the chief objects which the allies wish to obtair. bythe concession of a perfect right of equality to the Christian is to consolidate the Turkish empire by removing the differences existing between the two classes of society. The firuan will do just the contrary; it will make the breach greater than ever, and dissatisfy both,-the Christians with the indiscrimainate enlistment, which is a greater horror to them than any other thing, and the 3ahomedans by tuching so roughly all their prejudices at once. It will become a seed of discord which will paralyze the action of any Ministry which may be formed, aind, instead of giving a unity of action to the Governmeat., so indispensable for its relations with BRoaa, it will produce a serious crsis in the interior. Let Europe get rid of her illusions before it is too iste, and let the statesmen assembled at Paris thinl- twice before they subscribe to the extreme views ta,ken by the representatives of the 'allied Powers I here on this question, unless they be preparod to e xtirpate half the population of European Turlkey. I The conferences about the first point-namely, the Principalities, came to a conclusion on Monday last, and, apparently, if not to the satisfaction of al parties, at any rate with their acquiescence. After the proposition'of the Turirsh Government to adopt as the basis for the regulation of the Principalities the ancient conventions of the Porte with those countries had passed, every one of the foreign inisters came forward with projects about the. intern.' government of Moldavia and. Wallaclia Having accepted the Turldsh proposal, which gives to the Principalities alone the right to docide on all their internal affairs, this was rather a contradiction; but it was excusable, in so far as many reforms are imperiously- required which could be scarcely expected to be accomplished if thePrmcipalities were left to themselves;' for instance, equality before the law, equal distribution of taxation, the subjection of all classes to the conscription, and the admission of all classe to civil and military employment, in all of which reforms the Boyards were too much interested to do anything iflIeftto themselves. The first proposal made by all parties was the abolition of the organic statute drawn up after the Peace of Adrianople by the extraordinary assembly chosen under the auspices of Russia, and presided over by the Russian Consul-General at Bucharest, andwhich up to the present moment forms the constituition of the two Principalities, being only temporarily suspended by the convention of BaltaLiman. But when it came to the question of what was to be substituted opinions were completely at variance. Eachb of the representatives, as was natural to expect, was so imbued with the excellence of the institutions of his own country that every one adopted it as a model for the future arrangement of the Danubian Principalities. The English Ambassador proposed an Upper and Lower House,-the first hereditary and unpaid, the second elected and paid. The French Ambassador was for. a Senate and Legislative Chamber,-the first named, the second elected, andcboth paid. astlgy, the Austrian Internuncio thought the welfare of the Principalities wouild be best secured by confiding the legislative and highest government functions to a consultative body composed of the highest officials of the State, something in the style of the existingDivan, created by the convention of Balta-Liman. From this difference of views it could have been scarcely expected that a union should be effected, had it not been that the instructions on this question were such that whatever -was concluded would not be definitive. It was tobe only a discussion on the subject of the definitive arrangements to be made at Paris. The consequence was that neither the French Ambassador nor the Austrian Internuncio much pressed his views, and acquiesced at last in the views takenby the British Ambassador, without, however, committing himself in any wvay. No signatures, or any other symbol of a convention, have been therefore exchanged, and the question remains an open one for the conferences at Paris. For the last few days the rumour has been current that Omar Pasha was coming to Constantinople, and that he had already sent his baggage before him. I Some interpreted this ramour as a recall, others as a wish on his part to regain his lost ground at the Porte. The real state of the case is that he sent in, for the 999th time, his resignation, with the clause, as usual, that he would only remain with the army if certain conditions, which he had long ago urged, should be complied with. These conditions have reference to his position with regard to the Seraskierate, orMinistry of War, with which he hashada standing feud, no matter what person was at the head of it. Quarrels between Commanders-in-Chief and War Departments, however dangerous, are almost always sure to arise in case of ill-success; but with Omar Paslaitisa chronic disease. Nomanever had fuller powers, if he chose to use them, than the Sirdar Ehem possessed when at the head of the army of Roumelia, with the revenues of several provinces assigned to him, and even the power to issue paper money; and yet the archives of Stamboulteem with his lamentations, which it would be difficult to understand were it not for the solution which he himself proposes. This solution consists in his being Commander-in-Chief and Seraslder atthe same time, and then his naming a kaimakan, or lieutenant in his place, while he is with the army. Unfortunately this solution is by no means to the taste of the Government here. He hastherefore received ordersto remain where he is, especially as letters lately received from Sugdidi report that General Brunuer, who has replaced Bagration Moukhrausky, the late Russian Commander in Mingrelia, was collecting his forces and threatening the Turkish position. Mlost of the baggage which has actually arrived consists of the furniture found in the palace of the Princess Dadian at Sugdidi, and valued at several thousand pounds sterling. When the Turks. reached this latter place Omar Pasha ordered that the furniture should be removed to a church out of the place, which Skender Pasha converted into a blockhouse. The latter, with his usual energy and honesty, had everything removed and sentries placed over the church; so nothing was lost, and the whole furniture has now been removed by the orders of Omar Pasha. The French Consul at Suchum-Kaleh has made a report aoout the affair, which has made a great deal of noise in the country. Besides this, there is likewise a complaint lodged against Omar Pasha by Count 3Rosemaduque, a French subject, long settled in Mingrelia. He had established a silk manufactory in the country, and was in continual relation with the Princess Dadian. When theTurks passed the Ingour he was with the Russians, having found no opportunity to come where his inclination lay. Finally, towards the end of the month of November, he rejoined Omar Pasha's army, and gave some valuable information about the state of the country people as well as of the Russians. Omar Pasha promised to make such arrangements that his property should be respected; but, despite of this promise, he complains now, as a French subject, against him for having allowed his propertv to bepillaged. The fall intheexchabge is atillcontinuing;yesterday it reached 126piastres for the pound sterling, and the French 19apoleon at 98. It is, however, only felt in wholesale transactions. The retail market has not been affected at all. Thus, for instance, according to the Jourid de Constantti wple, beef and mutton, which until lately were soldW on the animal at 5if. the oka, are now at 3ff., and. yet retail they still cost 1* 15c. the oka. Flour, which cost 9f. the oka, has Jlikewise fallen to 4*f., and yet the price of bread has not been affectd It is the same in all other things. The Crimean nail has come iu this morning, at 9 o'clock, bringing, news up to the 12th inst. General Shiriley returned from Shumla on Tuesday last. Brigadier-General Watt retains the command until further orders. An accident of a very serious character happened to one of the Bashi-Bazouk squadrons. They were quartered, men and horses, in a wooden shed; the Bashis, who seemed to have forgotten, if they ever knew anything about, the laws of gravitation, were in the habit of catting out pieces of timber from the sides of the shed, andc of using them for firewood; the consequence was, that one fine morning the shed came down over their heads, killing eight and wounding U men, and killing and wounding 42 horses. The firstideawhichtook hold of theircomrades outside was that some diabolical scheme had been devised by the " Inglis' to make short work of I them, and they began to look for their pistols, but when they saw that the officers, who had hastened to the spot, threw offE their coats and began to work to get out of the ruins what was to be saved, they slso bgan, -and worked with a zeal quite astonishingin them.. The only thing to be regretted is that the oicerdid not look before to the statein which the sheds were.
&ONBYZARkETav OiTkyIBLUIGALVOE. The English funds this morning opeied with s -buoyant appearance, which, with the exception of a sdhrt interval was wel maintainea to the close. Consols for money were first quoted 91i to 1, being an advance of three-eighths on the improved prices of Saturday. From this they went to 91k, after which there was a reaction to 91i, only a single bargain, however, having been effected at that quotation. Before -the termation of buiness the 3market fully regained itstone, and the latest operations were at 91 for money, and 91 to 92 for the account. Consol Scrip was quoted 10 to X, and Exchequer Scrip 1I to X premium The chief cause of the prevailing ammation seemed to consist in the fact of the day for the commencement of the Peace Conferences having arrived without the previous occurrence of anything to disturb the confident hopes of their result. Bank Stocktclosed at 213 to 215; Reduced, 92: to ; New Three per Cents., 924 to 93; Long-Annuities, 131; Anniuties, 1885, 16; India Stock, 222 to 225; India-bonds Vs. to 3s. discount; Exchequer-bonds, 98; audExcfiequer. bills, 2s. discount to is. premium. There was no particular pressure for money in tho Stock-Exchange to-day; but at the Bank of England and in the discount-market the demand was very active. Foreign securities exlhbited a further improvement, and prices on the average were fairly sup. ported to the close. 'Operations took place in Turkish Six per Cents at 94, 95, and 95 for the account, while those in the Four per Cent. Guaranteeda Stock were at 100§, 100k and 100I for the account. The other business comprisedBrazilian Five per Cents., New, 100; Ecuador Provisional Land WVarrant, 5fi; Mexican, for account, 20A and i; Peruvian Three per Cents., 56k; Rnssian Five per Cents., 1094, i, and 105; Sardinian Five per Cents., 89- and ; Spanish Three per Cents., 43; the New-lieferred, 2S~ for money and fdr the account; anc Venezuela, 29k. The com-market was heavy this morning at the rates of M1onday last. The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 73f. 45c. for money and 73f. 80c. for the account, showing' another improvement of a quarter per cent. The Vienna money-market still presents a tendency to reaction. The French rate of exchange continues to manifestgreat firmness, and a smnall parcel of gold coin was received to-day from Paris. The bullion in the Bank of France is stiul understood to be increasing. The commercial advices from New York this week are very favourable, both as regards the state of the stock-market and the prospect of specie remittances to this country. Although no amount has been brought by the present steamer, the rate of exchange had reached a point which would have induced the transmission of a considerable sum but for the fact of the communication with Boston havmin been rendered uncertain from the accumulation of ice between that port and New York. The money-market had become easier, owing, among other causes, to the disbursement from the Treasury vaults of about half of the 600,0001. remaining due to Mexico, and choice short paper could therefore be discounted with ease at 7 per cent. An announcement that the claims of Texas on the Federal Government have been adjusted, and that about 1,400,0001. wiU thus become payable in the course of a few months to the creditors of that State, had likewise -tended to increase the feeling of confidence, which was further stimulated in a decided manner by the con-, tinued receipt of satisfactory news from this side regarding the prospects of peace. Erie Railway stock had advanced from 54 to 56k; Panama, from 100k to 104; Reading, from 87 to 891; and Illinois Central bonds, from 83i to 88. The general trade of the country had been greatly interrupted by the almost unexampled severity of the winter, but a sudden thaw had ats length set in. Great anxiety prevailed on account of the non-a-rival of the Collins steamer Pacific, which left Liverpool with the mail of the 23d of Janunry, and had already been more than a week overdue. Insurances were refused upon her at any lower rate than 25 per cent.; but general confidence was still entertained that she was only delayed by having fallen among fields of ice similar to those which had obstructed the Persia. ajs consequence of her nonarrival there wiUl proUiably be no fresh mail from New York umtil next MIonday, as it was the Pacific which should have left that port on the 16th of February, so as to be here the day after to-morrow. The Committee of the Stock-Exchange to-day took into consideration the peculiar circumstances connected with the issue of shares and obligations of the Royal Swedish Railway Company by the late Mlr. John Sadleir, and adopted the following resolution, postponing the settlement of outstanding transactions, and discountenancing for the present any further operations in them .- " Under the peculiar circumstances that have been brought to the notice of the comuittee regarding the position of the shares and obligations of the Royal Swedish Railway Company, the comnittee is of opinion that it would be detrihnental to the general interest of the public and the Stock-Exchange if any setUement in outstanding bargains in those shares and obligations took place at present; and the settling in the same is postponed accordingly. " Also resolved,-That no-new transactions in the shares or obligations of the Royal Swedish Railway Company wl be recognized by the committee until further notice." The commercial reports from the provincial towns for the past week are of a varied character, but on the whole favourable. At Manchester there has been considerable flatness, owing to a falling off in the orders for India, although the home demand is steady. The Birmingham advices show a tendency to lower quotations in the iron-market, consequent upon the limited extent of the purchases for America and the contined pressure for money. In the copper market, however, renewed firmness is observable, and the general trades of the place are also fairly surtained The Bimingham Chamber of Commerce, resting for a moment from the agitation of their currency views, have characteristicallv resolved to petition for the introduction of " protective" clauses to damage by their incongruity the simple provisions of DMr. Lowe's new partnership biL At Nottingham both the home and foreign demand for lace has been of an extraordinary character, while for hosiery it is like. wise good, although checked in some degree by the late advance in prices. In the woollen district3 therelhas been afurtherimprovement,andageneral increase of occupation. In the Irish linen-markets stocks are decreasing, and the transactions are in every respect healthy. The suspension was announced to-dayof the mercantile firm of Messrs. Sch;ifer and Brown, of Fenchurch-street. The amount of their liabilities was not stated. At a -meeting of the Port Phi31ip and Colonial Gold MIining Company, held to-day, Mr. J. D. Powles presiding, the report and accounts were the subject of a lengthened discssion. A great number of the shareholders regarded them as generally unsatisfactory, and complaints were made of the absence of the auditors. Another ground of objection was that, although the charter stipulates that the directors shall call annual meetings, two years have been allowed to pass without the proprietors being sunmoned to consult on the state of their affairs. In explanation of this, the board allege that they were not in a position to give any definite information, and therefore abstained from convening a meeting. They will, however, in future make them half-yearly instead of yearly. Of an original capital of 100,000l. the company now possess about 33,OOO1., and this- it is proposed shall be applied to the pur,coses of quarlz-crushing, which-it is stated will yield a considerable profit. The latest advicos speak of' the satisfactory resullts attending the produce of the recently-discoveredquartz region, the application of propermachinerybeing alone necessary to insure the development of its resources. Some of the shareholders thought that, after the e:perience afforded by other gold companies, the rnost prudent course wotld be to preserve the remaining assets and rateably distribute them., After an acrimnonious debate of about two hours, a proposal for a committee of investigation was brought forward, and, according to a show of hands, was apparently agreed to, bt, the directors requiring a decision by -ballot, anl adjournment eventially took place. The departures from the port of London for the Autlin colonies during the past week have comprised five vessels-twoto Adelide, oneto Sydney, one to Mellourne,n e to ne to New Zealand-with an aggregate capacity of 3,364tons.

THE CORY TRADE. MARK-LANE. iIO-NDAY AmmzxnoOm; FE. 25. The supplies last week were moderate, themost cousiderable being in country flour and foreign oats. The home. grown -wheat consisted of 5,567 quarters, the foreiga of 46555 quarters, in small cargoes from various ports. The show of samples this morning from Rent and Essex did not exceed an average, the condition being rather improved; trade, however, was dull, and, without a disposition to press below previous rates, a considerable quantity was left nnu sold at a late hour. Kentish vas quoted ls. to 2s. cheaper. Foreign found hittle inquiry, ht prices were maintained. The country flour amounted to 15,784 sacls, the foreign being only 145 sacks from Bremen. Business in all kinds was dull, -with scarcely any change in price. The top pr ce of Norfolks was 50s. The quantity of barley was 6,199 quaters of English and 2,910 quarters from Denmark. Sales weremadevith greater facility, but no advance was quotable. In malt there was no alteration. The sppjly of oats consisted of 4,574 quarters of Scotch and EnglEsh, and 21,66G quatrters of Danish and Datch. Trade -was limited for aU kinds, and the low qualities of Irish still on hand were Gd. cheaper. Of beanstherewerel,310 quartersfromAlexandriaand 867 of home growth. The quanttty of foreign peas was triflingsay, GS quarters; the Elnglish, 534. Both these descriptions of pulse were a very heavy sale, and white boiling peas must be quoted fully 2s. cheaper.

The report a abntract of which has appeaed in TA) lT*uis, was taken as reac L The CuArsMKS, in moving the adoption of the report, aid lbaes happy to announce a small addition to the rate cf dividend as compred with the pzeceding half-year, and an incetase in the dividend for the year 1855 as compared withhthat of 1854 There had been an increaset-in the rceipts and s reducsion in the expense. The dircctorshad placed an additional sura of 15,C000. to the fund for the xvntwal of the pemanent way, and during the past halfyear the working expense6 had been reduced by 22,000!. Tire directers had paid a great deal of attention to keeping nptbe permanent way in efaicient state. bir. HABBISON, the engineer, at the request ofthe chlair rr,an, explained the way in which the rolling stock became depieciated, and how it was renewed and replaced out of revenue. The rolling stock of the Bervick line, in 1849, was valued at 803,CCOt., ut its value in 1853 was reduced by 117,C000. below the first cost. This depreciation cane as a matter of necessity and hid to be provided for out of Tevenue. He stated that every nesgine belonging to the eoirpany wss duly registered; an account of its work was kept, the number of mniles it bad travelled, and the cost and natuwe of the repairs during each half-year. That enabled themt to estircate with considerable accuracy the amount of the contin&ences against which they had to provide in repairing saM reneIing the 1tock. The CrrAirmAn reTnarked tbathe did not see any prospect of clcsing the capital account for many y3ears to come. They had expended 943,CG0!. in the courSe of the past three years in- meetingthe wantsand requirements of the increasing traffc enthe company's railways. That sumn amounted to 6 per cent. on the total capital expended, and their gross revenue had increased 402,C0C0. a-year, or 31 per cent. (Bear, hear.) The traffic upon the Pontop line, upeon which 40,000!. had been recently expended, had increased fromu 707,000 tons in 1851, tol,035,OLO tons in 1855. It was satisfactory to know- that the permlanent way and rolirng stock weree iently maintained. The cost of maintenance had increased withl the auguseataltion of traffic. Mr. Alderman Lxsx~e seconded the motion for the adoption of the report, which was carried unanimously. TIedividendsreconuendedlinthe eport weredeclared; and Mesars. Wharton, Hunter, Dodsworth, andRitbson. the retiring directors, were unanimously re-elected. hMr. Hartley, of Sunderland, was dlected a director in the room of Mr. Leechman, deceased. 3Mr. Wylie, the retiring auditor, was re-lected. The meeting was then made special, and the directors 'Were authorized to raise money by the issue of a new debenture stock instead of on loans, the new stock to bear a guaranteed interest not exceeding 4per cent. per annum. The CiAmm3rN stated, that i- they could convert their fcating debt o: 6,000,M000. into an irredeeniable debenture %tock ef 4 per cent. they would save 20,M000. a-year, exeusive of the c,,st of stamps and comnissions in obtamning 'he mcney on mortgage. A vcte of thanks to the chairman and directors concluded the prcceedings. SODTH STAFFORDSHIRE. The hslf-yearly meeting of this cormpny was held at Iich£field yesterday; Mr. Ri. C. Clrawner in the chair. lhe report stated that the sum of 04,929!. had been charged to capital account durng the last half-year, about one-half of w h had been for land and wors on the Can'ncek and Norton branches, and the remainder chiefly for wa;gons required for the traffic aud for stations. It wa necessary to proceed vigorously with the above-named branches, inasmuch as the P?arliamentary eriod for their completion VIas fixed for the 2d of Januazy, 1857. At the request of 3lr. 3i'Clean, the lessee, a cemmittee had been appointed to examine the accounts of expenditure smnce the commencement of the lease, and to prepare the required echedules to be attached to the lease of the Stour Valley Junction or Tij,ton branch, and the recommendations of that com. mittee were under the consideration of the board. The receipts on capital account had been 1,134,622!., and the expenditure 1,117,9031., leaving a balance of 10,718!. The ClurMrAs, having referred to the chief points of the report, said that the waggons had been paid for by shares, Mr. Wright, the builder, havin en out the cost in shares. The committee, to whom allusion was xnade, had confirmcd the statement preNiously made by their enxineer, Mr. Baker. Theline andworkswerc in a good state, and the accounts of the lessee highly satisfactory. It w_s not necessary to filU up the vacancy whuich had occurred inthe board of directors, asthe existing body was amply sufficient to discharge the business of the coinpany. it was right to state that they must raise 100,000!. on account of the Cannock and Norton branches before the June of next year or their dividends would eo stopped. They had power to borrow 19,000t.,andhad surplus lands to the value of 10,000!., and the uncalled capitad amounted to 21. 10s. per share. The directors had carefully considered the subject with the view of rendering the caU as easy as possible, and had determined t nmake a cal of 30s. per share payable on the 1st of May next. They had no ot-her alternative. - He concluded by moving the adoption of the reort5 wbich, being seconded, v-as carried unanimously. Mr. Payne, of Birmingham, and Xr. Smith, of Dudley, were re elected directors. A dividend of 4 per cent., payable on the 1It of March (less income-tax), was then declared. The interest at 5 per cent. to the 31st ult. on calls paid in advance upon the o!d and new shares will be paid at the same time. The meeting then broke up. SOUITH WALES.

In December, 1854, the paintof brought a action at law against W.

The bill also alleged that the defendant Crowther, for the purpose of defrauding the plaintifl t had made a fraudulent and collusive sale of a part of his real estate, called the Golas an estat, to nother defendant, Dixon; that n at, or, if anuy, only o small p at of the purchase-money hadbeen andbyDionf that ,on had contractd toseilsuch estate to a third defendant, in srloe, bit had not paid the whole otrchase-money, and ie prayed that it might be de- clredthalinse Golthan estate and other the real esate of W.

The bill was fled against W. Crowther, Dixon, and Pardoe, atnd neither the plaintiffs attorney in the action at lav;, nor the plaintiff's assignee in insolvency, nor minten, were parties to thesuit. The defendant sardoe da murred to the bill-chst, on the ground that the intere t which the plaintiff derived under the judge's order, as registered in pursuance of the 1st and 2d of Vioris, c. 110, in the Golthan arnd Crowther's other reul estate pased to the plaintiffos assignee int ofvency and, secondly, for ant of equity. Thebll first sledbad been amended, and to the original bill Dixon had put in a plea of the plaintifus insolvency and an answer to the charges of fraud, but he now demburred to the lmended hiUl for want of cequity. It wis also contended that the bill wdas prematede, inasmuch ass yeatr had not expired betwreen the registration of the ruleof theCourt of Common Pleas undersection 190 fthe cte and of Victoria, c. 110, and the fliog of the bill, and by way of demurrer orci tngu, that the alnintifffs attorneyat-law, her assignee in inswove ncy, and byton, or saome or one ofthem, should have been before the Coart. Msr. MaIs ainsd 0. D'. Tudor appeared for P'ardoe, and tor. W. P Murray for Dixmon. Mar. D. to. bpaid of the common law bar, and Mr Sof thA supported the bill. The ViCE-CtoeuLnder stid that the biUl was of a very peculiar character, and there was a fatal objection to it, It sought to enforce as a charge on land certain smns of money which, byo rule of acourt of comgmon law, had been ordered to be paid not to the plaintii; who now sourht the interference of this Ceurt to enforce the charge, hut to another person. The bill was Siled for the purpose of nutting in force a statatory remedy, and in order that it might be maintained it must be shown that there was in the statute a clear enactment which should authorizethe Coutto dsay that the sums songht to be enforced as a charge were within its scope. By the 18th section of 1st and 2d * ictoria, c. 1I0, which gave a remedy in respect of a rule as contradistinlguished from a judgment of a court of law, it is enacted that a3U rules of courts of common lavw whereby any sums of money or any costs should be payable to any person should have the effect of judgments in the superior courts, and the persons to whom any such moneys or costs should be payable should be deemed judgment. creditors wiithin the meaning of the act, and all remedies thereby given to judgment creditors were in like manner given to persons to whem any moneys or costs were by inch rules directed to be paid. The person therefore who soug7ht to enforc as a charge on land a remle of a court of common law directing the payment of a sum of money ought to be the person to whom the money was by the ruile payable. Here one sum of money isa. to be p aid to the plaintiffs attorney by wa of costs, and the other sum was unquestionably not to be paid to the plaintiff, although the payment of beth sums would no doubt have redounded to the plaintiff's benefit by procuring herrelease from prison. Ho wished it to he understood that he decided the case wholly upon the 18th section of the 1st and 2d Victoria, chap. 110, and not on any other of those grounds raised by the demurrer and in the argument. Pardoe's demurrer munst therefore be allowed, hut, as Dix;on had answered the original bill, he would hear Mr. Murray to-morrow (Tuesday) morning on the point as to whether Dixon could demur to the amended bill afterlmaving answrered the original hilU.
I COURT OF QtJEEYS BNCE GnmrTAT.r. Fvin 9T. SRWEARI A-A l % w F - - MSV9iU 3 at Mi" Prius, before Lord CAmPmELL and Common .rwuic$l Mr. Lush appeared for the plaintifl, and Mr. Hawkins for the defendant. The plaintiffs, Charles Stewart and his wife, sued the dc. fendant, James Saul, to recover damages for an injury sustained by the wife by reason of the neglgent driving of the defendant's servant. The defendant was the ownmer of a onehorsed omnibus, which pled between the Limehouse station of the Blackwall Ralway and the Greenwich ferry. It appeared that on the evening of the 5th of October last the female plaintiff was walking with her daughter on the pavement at Millwall, when they heard the omnbus coming rapidly behind them. The man was whipping his home and coming across the road on to the footpath. The daughter was immediately struck and knocked into a passage. She was this saved from further injury; but her 3mother was jammed between the wheels of the omnibus and the wall. After a shortinterval, the omnibus was backed a little, and the'poor woman fell, to all appearance dead, between tEe home and the wheels. She was immediately carried to her daughter's residence, where she was confined for several weeks from the injuries which she had sustained in various parts of the body, and which had left her in such a state that she was still unable to stand; so that she wzs obliged to be carried into and out of court. It appeared that the road -where the accident took place was extremely narrow, there being only room enough for two carriages to pass, and that the accident was bccasioned by the negligence of the driver, in allowing the reins to get under the horse's tail, which made the horse start off. It further apeared that the plaintiff was a gatekeeper at Messrs. Scott Russell and Co.'s, and his wife had formerly been in the habit of assisting him by going out nursing, washing, &c. This source of income was totally put an end to by the feeble state to which she was now reduced, and which rendered her com7lete recovery a matter of uncertainty. Mlr. sHWRL'w}, on the part of the defendant, admitted that there must be a verdict against his client. The plaintiff was entitled to be reimbursed the expenses to which he bad been put, and also to have a reasonable compensation for the pam and suffering of his wife and for the loss of her services. Lord CAPBELI said the case had been very properly conducted on both sides, and that the jury must say what damages the plaintiff ought to have. The jury found a verdial for the plaintiff-Damages, 701. W5S ,T V. 13Uan G AN.D OTHEBS. Mr. H. Hill, Q.C., Mr. W. S. Cross, and Mr. Bell appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Keating and Mr. Dowdes. we'I for the deoendants. Mr. BELT, the junior counsel, stated that the action was brought by Charles West against J. Billing, Baron Erskine (since dead), G. L, Browne, and F. P. Hare, to recover damages for the breach of an agreement into which the parties had entered for the construction of a submarine te.egraph from Holyhead to lngsa'on. There was also a count for slander of the plaintiff's title to certain shares in a company which had been formed for constructin the said submarine telegraph, and a third for work and losur as a contractor and enineer. Mr. BELL said the defendant Bminghad pleadedi16 pleas, which the learned gentleman proceeded to open. Lord Cnsrrsa said the pleas would gLve but little information to the jury, and none to the judge. Mr. SnnK'is.-Andto nobody else. Mr. BRit, proceeded to state that the defendant, Baron Erskine. had pleaded 19 plas (Laughter.) Lord CA3IPBEL said that upon the whole, he was satisfied with the new system o bnt his lordship expressed his regret to see a record of the kind now before the Cout. 3Mr. HtLL said there was one anomaly in the case which he might mention, and that was that the first count had been held bad on demurrer, and several of the 16 pleas had also been held to be bad on demurrer, and yet the parties badcome hereto try iLsues in fact raisedupon allthose pleas. M1r. Rs-AmIu said that 13 of the plea on which isswes were raised had been held to be bad in substance. Lord aaslPBELL said he thought the case-was not to the credit of the profession, and his Lordship suggested that the parties should select some learned pleadLer, to whom all the issues might be referred. Mr. HfLL said he was quite willing, and he would agree to be bound by the judgment of the Court on the first count, as he did not wish to go to a court of error. If the case were referred it might be taken at once. Mr. KnATniG said he had no objection to refertthe cause. So far as the- first count was concerned there was no difficulty, but his client felb some difficulty as to the second count, which charged the defendants w%ith slander of the plaintiff's title to certain shares. Iord CAmnPBEL said the arbitrator could dispose of that, Mr. xEAn.Gu said his cient had no authority. lord CArrBELL said lie had abundant authority. After some further discuEsion, the cause was referred to an arbitrator. _ - - - ARN - stsv. 3M:CAtE Mri. 3L-Chambersand M1r. J.3Broin arpeared for the plaintiff- and Mfr. Atherton. Q.C.r for the defendant. mzis was an action An which the plaintif, a French Ca- nadian pilot, souhgt to recover dthages from a eeu f:or ha"nugoen . rou ht to Englana in -one - of the ee dant's ships against hwill it appeared from' the tate maent made by the pl4intiff that he had been emploved by the master of the defendant's 5hip topilot hivesse down the St. Lawrence, from Quebec to a piace named Bic In the regular course, a pilot would be DUt on Shore atBicl but in this instance the plaintiff said the master was to put him ashore lower down the river, ataplace calledPointe meau. He, however, negeeted to do ao, and brought him to England. For the defencethe master Was examined, and stateatbat the plaintiff had agreed to take his chance of being able to land at Point Demeau, and that when the vessel arrived off that point there was a gale of wind blowing, and the sea-was so heavy t'hat it would havo been dangerous to atterapt to put the pilot ashore. The master"produced his lo-boo, in which all the particulars of he transaction had been minutely entered, and which confirned his statement, suppoaing the entry to have been made on4 fdc at the time, ashe stated. But part of the entries, though swon to by the plaintiff, appeared to have been made -in a different handwriting from the rest; and in other respects it was sought to be shown that the entry had been tampered with. lord CQpBEcx, in sunming up the evidence, said that when fairly kept the log-book was the best possible evidence, but it was the worst if, as stated by the nlaintiff, it had been tampered with. The question was whether the plaintiff had enteredintothe agreement stated by the defendant, for, if so, the latter was entitled to a verdict. On the other hand, if ho had not entered into that agreement, the plaintiff would be entitled to a verdict and such an amount of dam es as would cover the expcenses to which the had beenl pnt by the defendant's conduct in bringig him to England against his will. The jury found their verdict for the plaintiff-Damages, SECOND COURT. (Sittings at Nis Prius beforiA Mr. Justice Enim and a Com 72wn7 jursy.) IAEXSI MOCK V. TrODD. lr. O'IaMcnd Mlr. Petersdorff were counsel for the plaintif and Mr. Edwin James and Mr. Dowdeswell for the defendant. This was an action brought to recover compensation in damages for an injury which the plaintiff had sustaited by reason of the alleged negligence in driving a cart by the defendazt's servant. The plaintiff was a merchant living in the Old Kent-road, and the defendant was a builder at Brompton. On the 4th of January last the plaintiffwas drivg a gig along Duke-street, Chelsea, when, he observed tw cartscoming up Lombard-street. He drew his gigas near the corner of ]anvers-street as he possibly could. The driver of a cart coming along Danvers-street called out in an abrupt manner, " Get out of the way." A friend of the plaintiff said they would not move, and there was room enough for him; and the companion of the plaintiff said, "You're not everybody." Upon which the carter said he ;as not going to stoP there all day, and drove against the gig, Vhich it upset, the plaintiff and his friend were thrown out a eonsiderable distance, and the pony was thrown down. The carter went off as soon as he could, but was pursued, and it was then discovered that the cart belonged to the defendant. A witness who S3w the accident stated that the gig was placed across Danvers-6treet, and that it was impossible the crt cofuldt have passed onlesthe plaintiff had driven his or the defendant it was urged that if the urg thought theplaintiff had contributed to the accident Jby his ohst: nacy they would not give the plaintiffa verdict. The cart had a right to assume that the gig would be moved on a foot, and then there would have been no damae. The learned JuDGE said, in summing up, that unless the accident arose entirely and solely from the conduct of the defendant's servant the defendant would be entitled to their verdict. If a man placed a gig across the middle of a road he should say that such person contributed to the accident, and could not entitle himselftoa verdict. The Jury at once agreed to a verdict for the defendant.

Coller and Mr. Gates were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Edwin James and Mr. Hawkins appeared for the defendanxt. The plaintiff is a cab proprietor who sought to recover 12. as the value of a horse alleged to have been klled through the negligent driving of the defendant, on Snnday night, the 2d of December last. According to the evidence of the cab-driver he was proceeding at a regular pace with a fare up PiccadiDly from Kensington, at 11 o'clock at night, when a pony came rushing up -with the forewvheds of a phaeton at his heels, and knocking down his horse broke the shaft and went bodily over him, after which he continued his mad career to Park-lane, where he was stopped. The cabman having "p icked up" his horse, proceeded to look fortbe owner of the runaway pony, whom he found with his wife on the pavement and the body of his phaeton stuck fast in a hunppost. At that time the horse Id not exhibit any serious symptom, thouoh he was lame, andt the defendant, having deposited his wiffe in a house, requested the driver to assist him in the pursuit of his pony. Hec accordingly drove him to Park-lane, where they overtook the pony, and hack to Clarges-street, where the defendant dismissed him with his fare and the offer of 2t. for the injury done tothe shaft. The driver then, finding that his horse was getting stiff and il,took him ata footpace to the stables. On the day after he could hardly move his hind-quarters, refused his food, and laid himself down, and, langtushing, died on the fourth day after the accident. A!fter his death afarrier eraminedhim, andfound hislungs andkidneysgreatlyinflamed-symptms whichheattsibuted to the injury received on the uMday night, and which, in his opinion, were amply sufficient to cause death. On the paot of the defendant it was shown that the pony, having been startled in some unaccountable manner, took fright on th night in question, andihat thce phaeton, havin gr--azed or brokcen the tp of the cabehaft, was forced agao st the lamppost in order to avoid the cab on the one hand and the housecon the other.

As they were lying on the pavement the cab-driver came up, and, after demanding compensationfor hisbroken shaft, offered to drive the " gent and~ mLady" home.

Stevens, well experienced authorities on such subjects, deposed that, in t;heir belief the horse, which was shown to 1ave been little more than "skin and bon." could not have received any injury which led to its death on the night in ouestion; but Ithat tke result of thepost mortem examination satisfied them thatthepoor thinghaddied the death naturalto a cab-horse. TheCm3wBA-RoS left theevidenceto the juryto say whether the defendant had been shown to have been negli[gntly driving on the night in question, so as to make him responsible for the injury alleged to have been sustained by the plaintiff's horse. f the affair was an inevitable aceident, the defendant was not liable. If he was negligent the question vvould arise whether the plaintiff's horse had died of ny injury received from the defendant's pony on that night, of from natural causes; and whether, if liable at all, the defendant was responsible for more than the injury to the shat. The jury at once returned a verdict for the defendant, on the ground that it was an accident. This was the last cause in the list, and the Court broke up at 6 o'clock.
COUBT OF BANKBUPTCY, Basing7tall-stred, Feb. 2?i. rnV VFY-T. {Before Mtr. CornmzisionerFAsm) The banlrupt, George Pell, was described as a scrivener, ironmaster, and maltster, of Welford, in the county of Northampton. This was the adjourned examination meeting Mr. iawrance supported. Mr. LIN.-rATIM, for the assignees, stated that the bankrupt had not been able to file his accounts, owing to a liti-. gation which had been pending between the assignees and t,he lorthamptonshire Banldng Company. The assignees, under the direction of the Cont* had sued the comnyn to recover about 10,0001., the value of property of which it was said they had inproperly possessed themselves. The ass'gnees had obtaineda verdict, and the result was that the company would have to restore to the estate all the moneys they had received since Aaugust, 1854, and would not be permitted to prove for any advances since made, the bankrupt having at that time, to their knowledge, committed an act of bankruptcy. It appeared that the bankrupt had kept accountswith the bink under no less than 16 different heads; and it was alleged by him that this was done at the instance of the manager and other directo:s, with whom he was connected inrailway speculations, for the pm-pose of concealing from the shareholders generally the precise position of affairs. There were balances due on these several accounts to the amount of between 40,0001. and 50,0001., but Mr. Pell alleged that these balances ought to be paid by Mr. Spiller, Mr. Freeman, or 3r. Phipps, who. were provisional committeemen in the various railway schemes in which the bankrupt had been concerned Towards the end of 1854 it appeared that an agreement had been entered into with the then managers of the bank, wherebythey agreed to blot out the whole -of the -balance standing against the bankrupt in the several accounts, on payment of 6,000L by instalments, and on certain securities einmg surrendered to them. As the bank bad since disputed the validity of that agreement, the bankrupt had been prevented from making up his accounts. Mr. BAGLEY said, he appeared to support a proof. for several thousand pounds for the Northamptonshire Banking Company, and he asserted that the statement just made was incapable of proof. The bankrupt was examined, and deposed that he opened au account with the Northamptenshire Banking Company in 1842. He had then only one account. In 1845 a second account was opened, and ultimately as many as 16, but of several of them he had no knowledge. Some pass-books were sent to him, but of other accounts he had not seen the pass-books to that hour. In 1854 his accounts were overdrwn by about 20,6001. A large portion of that balance arose from railway speculations m which he was engaged with Spiller, Freeman, and Phipps, three of the directors of the bank. One was the Rugby, Warwick, and Worcester Railway Company, which vas ordered to be wound up in 1849, and this eaused an outlay of at leas 4,0001. He diacbarged that amount by means of advances made by tbe bank for the purpose, which were debited to some of the accounts. Ereeman, whowas concernsedmi the scheme, paid sie ortion of this outlay.,- Mr. BAGY.-Freeinanlas been 'dead -since 1851. The bankrupt furtherstated that in another railway spec. lation, in which Phipps and Spiller were provisional committeemen, he made an outlay of 8,0001. or 10,0001. Mr. Phipps, now the registered public officer of the bankr, had not paid any portion of that amount. On the 23d of Novenier, 1854, he came to an agreement with the bank that his account should be settled by paying 6,0001. in instalments, the bak retaining certain securities which they held in satisfaction of the remainderof the debt. Iepaid one. instalment; then r.Sqiller, the manager of the bank, died, Uand theagreeinenb Ib still in dispute, and he had consequently bon uableto fi.e ias jiccounts.- MX.. IrXLnATxn asked that the proofs. tendered IV the bafik should bc submitted to investigation. The CoymssrwoN.-I think the bankcan hardly oppose that; th6y appear to have kept these accounts in rather an odd way. 3Mr. B.&dLEY said, there was no single item which the bank was not able to explain, and they were ready to do so. Mr. LAWRAINZ submitted that the short -way to deal with the question was to try the Validity and suficiency of. the compromise of November, 1IM, whereby the hank agreed to accept 6,000%. and certain securities for the whole debt. After a conversation, it wasdeterimined that the bankrupt should commence his accounts from the 21st of June, 1854, and that the meeting should be adjoumed for two months - the accounts with the bank to be investigated in the meantime.

In the matter of Wlliam Dent, which was reported afew days since in lhec 2Vmes, the following circumstance has been mentioned to our reporter in terms of just indignation. On the day of Mr. Dent's certilicate meeting, a person who piofesses to report in this-court, fortheMoringHeHrtad followed the bankrupt out of court when the meeting was ever, and undertook for 3Z. to keep the case out of " the papers" The banlraupt foolisblyconsented, and paid the 3i. rtext morning the case appeared in all the papers except the one represented by the person alluded to, and the bankrupt indigantly complained of what had been, practised upon him It is evident that if by any accidrn4.. or that the reporters in the exercise of their discretion lad h1^ught tho caso an unimportant one, tho case of Dent had been omitted from the other morning paper, the character ecd honour of the reporters of the other, journals would have been seriously afected.

POLICE. GuThDHALL-Mx Wiliam Downing Brmce, a barrister. at-3aw, of 2, Plowden-buildings, Temnpe, appeared upon a summons before Sir R. W. CARDEN, to answer a complaint of unlawfuly and maliciouslyublishing a eertain false and defamatory libel, in which he leged that -ohnThomas Plomer was convicted at the Central Criminal Court in April, 1847, of having committed wilful and corrupt per. lury. Mr. Giffard (istructed by Mr. Humphreys) appeared for the complainant, anid Mr. Ballantine (instructed by Mr. ILewis) conducted the defence. This complaint, it appeared, arose out of a fauily quarrel both parties being connectedbymarriage, andthe defendant under a misapprehension, as Mr. Ballantine stated, ha1 written a somewhat intemperat:e letter to a mutual friena, who immediately showed it to the compliniant. That let. ter contained the libel complained of, and, under -a.ll the circumstances, the -defendant said -he asMing to make an apology and withdraw the imputations in the letter alluded to. This proposal to effect an *icabl atmnt of their family differences was howeve,r db h compl inant, andl the case w th p Sir R. W. CAssDan saidl it a pinucaet dd. matte amicbly, e hadno oter corseIpen to him thinu toconimit Te defendan for trial required to enter into bis own recognisaces to appear artd swer the charge at the Central Criminal Court. 13ow-sTnzr.-A oan naiud Robert Ludwiche, who hs long been ss d by the pohce; was broughtbefore Mr. Hx:1, charged with having A large quantitFy of base coin in his possession. It appeared that Sergeants Buc- ind Thonas, of the F division, found the prisoner in the Blls Head publichouse in Vere-street, Clare-market, at about 11 o'clock that morniug. Buck at once took hint into custody, and Thomas, seeing him drop a pareel on the floor, snatched lit up, ard went outside to examine. it without risk of interruption from some suspected or "suspicious" persons who were standing near the fire. The parcel contained 44 counterfeit shillings, several of them apparently from one mouldL Thomas returned to sarch the room, vbere he found two other parcels, containing respectively 31 hlf-crowns and 49 shilligs, aU of which on examination he found to be couu. tefeit.--* Mr. HAIL commDitted him for t1i, obseri that he would! take bail in two sureties of 601. each, and the prisoner's own reeonizances in 1001. Wfssr ysrMt-Williamn-Neleen and Edward Rose, two privates of the Scots Fusileer Guards, were chargedewiththe following outrageous conduct:- John Thomas Watson, a very respectable-looking mun,73 years ofae, nmteof EmeryHil's Almshouses,Westninstr. stated that on Saturday aftemoon he was passing down Victoria-street% when the defendants and two women, all apparently in a state of intoxication, emerged from Orchard-street, followed by a number of boys yelling and hooting. Neleen was sWinging his belt over his head among the crowd, and the other defendant was running after tho boys with in uplifted cane. Suddenly. complainant reeived two vrolent blows on the head from the bukcle of Neleen's belt, which sent him reelitg against the wal and some gentlemen who had witnessed tho assault followecehis assailant and gave uni in charge. Georgo Rowles, i266 A, proved seeiug the defendants andtheir cornpanions leave Orchard-street an descnbed, and assault-thc eomplainant. When he took Neleen into custody he struck him several timic6s, ut did, not hurt him much. Rose made several violent 'efforts to rescue the other prisoner and two or three -persons -in the miob were also assaulted Dy the defendants. Neleen denied that he had struck tei age& complainantt and Rose said that he only quietly teied-to get the other to the barracks. Mr. ArwomN said that he looked upon conflicts of this description as very serious matters, for there was no knowing where the mischief commencing in a drunken scuffle with the military might end, especialy when their conflict was with the civil power, and the discipline of the soldier left him less excuse for a violation of the law and resistance to the authorities than might be urged by any other class of persons. It was quite clear that Neleen did not know what mischief he might do in s indiscnminately,vith such a dangerous weiCa as his belt, and when Rose. who was proved not to hav be en samuch affected by drink ashis companion, .found him in custod,houe s best effortshto liberato him by force.. - y Nedeen w,as fined el., and committed for two months in default, for the assault on Watson, and a further imprison. ment of 14 days for attacking the constable; and Rosoe was fined 20s., or 14 days, for the attempted rescue. Andrew Snellin and Patrick Collins werer finally examined, charged -with being concerned with eight or ten others not in custody in a violent attack upon MTr. John Jones, pro prietor of the Grosvenor Arms Tavern, Lower Belgrave-place, and Gerard Argyl, police-constable 194 B. The defendants and a number of other fellows went to MIr. Jones's house, and, after b?eing supplied with a quantity of liquor, simultaneously made a rus2 to the door mithout payment. This being a conunon trick among a cLass of low personsilnown hythe appellation of "moucensr," Mtr. Jones succeeded in stopping the defendants, when Collins tried to strangle him, an d dealt him a severe blow which gave him a bLack eye. The constable Argyle was conveying the def endant Collins to the station when the rest of the gang, assisted by SneDin, fell upon him, -and on Mr. Jones endearouring pto asic bmn he was also severely beaten. The injuries the policeman received were such as to place him under medical treatment and render him unfit for duty. Mr. AmsoLD said he should commit the prisoners for trial. The defendants observed that they would rather he disposed of it summarily.. Mr. AnNOLD had no doubt they would, hut, as he thougiht the punishment he had the power to inflict would be inadequate, he was determined to send the case before a 3ury. The defendants were accordingly committed for trial bill being refused for their appearance. THsAMS.-Mr. YAxRDLEY has received a check for 5. from "G. W.," and one sovereign from "J.

SOUMHAWUA -Frederick Quennell, a diminutive and rather repulsive-looking man, about 40 years of age (a relative to Quennell who was hung a few years ago at Horsemonger-lane Gaol for the murder of his brother), described in the chargesheet as a painter, was] brought before Mr. A'BETKL¶rr, charged with atteiptin" to murder William Hurcum in the Surrey Theatre, by stridng him on the head and body with a heavy iron rod. Police-constable John Measures, 160L, said that on Saturday night, about 10 o'clock, he was on duty in the Blackfriars-road, near the portico in front of the Surrey Theatre, when he was informed that the audience and every one inside the theatre were alarmed at a murder being conamitted on te stage by one of the scene-shifiers. He instantly went to the stage-door and was admitted by the proprietors, when the prisoner wvas given into his custody for attempting to murder William lIurcum, by striing binm on the head with an iron rod about four feet long and rather more than an inch in circumference, which witness received from a man named William lennard, one of the scene-shifters. There was at the time considerable excitemnent on the stage as well as among the audience, which was, however, soon pacified. The prisoner gave himself p to himwithout making any remarks, and he conveyed him to the Tower-street police-station. Mr. ABEcEMMrr.-Is the injured man in attendance? Measures.-He is not, Sir. He was attended to inmediately by a medical gentleman, and removed to his house, where he now remains in bed. - Mr. A!'BExCx .-Did you see VWiliam Hurcum, the injured man ? Measures.-Yes, Sir; I saw him lying on a table in one of the dressing-rooms, bleeding profusely from a wound on the back of his head. He was then insensible. Mr. A'lEcImcrr-Is there any medical man present to give evidence? ?,feasures.-There is not, Sir; but I produce a certificate from Mfr. Ddnaghue, who attended him, setting forth that he has a severe scalp wound at the back of the head and other injuries about the body. Mr. A'BExCucw.-Isthere anyone in court wh o witnessed the transaction ? Measures.-I have a woman who was inthe dressing-room at the time, Sir. Mary Hal, a middle-aged woman, residing at No. 34. Grosvenor-place, Borough-road, stated that she was employed at the Surrey Theatre as a dresser. She knewv the prisoner as being a pointer, and the injured man, William Hurcum, as a scene- ab the same place. On Saturday night, about 10 o'clock, witness was sitting in her dressingroom, on the stage, when the prisoner came in, and after remaining therea short time he crossed the room towards the entrance just as Hurcum was pas-ing. She heard him niako use of some angry vords towards the latter, and strike him on the head with somethin which he held in his hand. Hurcum then fell down, and witness saw that the back part of his head was bleeding ; and immediately afterwards she saw the iron rod produced taken away from him- Mr. AxBEcxr.-Did you see anyFthing in his hand when he came into your ds-room? *Witness.-Yes, rdid, ir; but I thought it was a stick, as it had a light appearamce. Ir. A'BxExEi (to the prisoner).-Have you any question to ask this witness? P'risoner (sullenly).-No, I have not. Measures said that he had no other vitnesses to caU at present; but if the prisoner were remanded he shoull be able to produce William Lenmard, who wrenched the rod from hin, and who heard him say, when he attacked Hurcum, that he would be hung for him, the same as his cousin was a few years ago. He also understood that they had had some words together Eeveral -ines in the course of the evening. Mr. A'BxCxECTT accordingly remanded the prisoner for a week, and he was conveyed to Horsemonger-lane GaoL IzMLum-Samnel Honeyball, formerly a carman on the South-Eastern Railway, was placed at the bar before Mr. ELTaoTr, on a charge of stealing three packages of goods belonging to fr. Jennings, an officer on the Reading granch. The prisoner was remanded to give time for the attendance of the necessary witnesses.

A F Enym M ¶N-TBA.-Within the last few weeks many private residences in the upper part of the city, particularly in the Sixteenth Ward, have been forcibly entered androbbed, and the occupants' lives placed injeopardy from the bold and reckless vilains perpetrating these crimes, who have little hesitation to shoot, run through, or hmook on the head any one having the temerity to interfere with them while in pursuit of plunder. An occurrence, however, recently took place which came near costing a rascal his worthless life, and one which should strike terror to all evildbers. It appears that a wealthy and scientific gentleman, whose name we will not now mention, residing m Twenty-first-street, between the Eighth and Ninth avenues, has a fence about the rear yard of his premises, over which it is now impossible for rogues to clamber, and by this means they might in the night time gain access to his delDling. WVishing to prevent anything of the kind,he a few evenings agoset a springboard inthe garden at that point of the fence where a thief wouldbo most likely to get over. In the end of this board (nearly 2Ofeet in length), was firmly attached a sharp and immense tobacco cutter, weighing 1Ghb, and so prepared with springs that upon any onegettig fromthe outside and stepping upon a small platform on his way over the fence, the trap would spring and propel with great force the end of the plank containing the cutter against the person treading upon the dangerous and forbidden ground. This fearful mantrap was baited, and set several nights in succession, but without catching any game, and the inventor began to think that he had had aR his trouble and expense for nothing. Abont 2 o'clock, however, a few mornigs since, thYs rogue-catcher was heard to spring against the fence with so much force that several inmnates of the' house were awakened by it. As soon as possible the owner of the premises and a man in his employ hunried to the garden expecting to capture a crippled thief, but they were disappointed; the work of effectualy maining had been accomplished, but the victim had jumped into the street and hobbled off. He was traced some distance by the copious flowing of blood, but the fugitive could not be discovered, he probably havine been taken up and conveyed away by some accomplices. ba enterig it was discovered that the power of the spring-board had forced the iron cutter through a two-inch plank of the fence, by the side of which was found part of a brogan shoa or boot, containing three toes and other parts of a man's foot, which had been severed by the victlm springing the trap. The blood at the time was flowing from the lost limb Judging from the remnant of the shoe found, it was of English manufacture, and hence the wearer is supposed to have been an English burglar. Nothing more has been heard of this unknown victim, nor any more rascals canght, notwithstanding- this infernal Jnachine (if so it may be termed) has since been nightly set. This part of a man, although he hase sustained a great loss, may consider himself fortunate that he succeeded in escaping with his life The"' "cutter," had it struck himn in the abdomen, would have instantly divided his body.-A'ew York- Tribune. * MussER crn HroawAy ROBBERY.-Another murder was committed on Sunday morning last, under very daring circumstances, in the metropolis. The scene of this catastrophe was Tower-hill, and the following are the particulars as far as they can be as yet gleaned. About halfpast 2 o'clock a man, whose name it has been subsequently discovered was George Brown, was stopped while returning homeward byawoman and two men, robbed, and, on resisting, knocked on the head with a life-preserver with such force as to break the skull and occas.ion deathl within a few hours. The umfortunate man as discovered b a policeman ying upon the pavement near' the Crooked rilet Publichouse, Sparow-corner, in a state of insensibility from the sevenity of.the blow. When found his pockets were turned inside out. As he still breathed, a constable of the H division, by whom he was discovered, obtained assistance, and carried him on a stretcher to Eeman-street police staion. spector Marsh, 'who was ondtyatthestation, immediately sent for Dr. ConnelTy, the divisional medical officer, who, on examining the body, discovered that a concussion of the brain had taken place. There was a very severe wound on the head, extending from behind the right earto the crown. -At the time the policeman discovered the body blood was flowing from it copiously, but the unfortunate man began to sink rapidly after he was taken to the stationhoUse. He was removed assoonas possibleto the London Hospital, but, notwithstandiin every attention of the house surgeons, ressrs. Adams and Ross, hedied in the afternoon at 4o'clock, having never recovered his senses. From the inquiies made by the police it appears that the name of the deceased is William Brown, and he resides at WhitechapeL He had been spending the evening with some friends, and was on his way home when a female stopped him at the cornerof the3limories. Be was rather inebriated at the time, and while in conversation with the woman the tio men, who appeared to have been lying in oait, rushed on him, and one of them knocked him down with at life pre server. Thtey then ri9ed his pockets and decampd T-o very suspiions characters were seen in the neighbourhood some time befote, and In4ector Forey has been engaged to trace their movements. As the men are known to the police, no difficulty is apprehended, but the woman is not at present know.c The body of the deceased now lies at the London Hospital, where it awaits an inquest. Considerable alarm has been OCCasioned in the neighbourzhood in consequence of the occurrence, con pled with the fact of thze dreadful prevalence of crime at the present moment, not orly in the metropolis but tbzonzout the country. TUm AeiRICAN hf rs,-L 0woar Feb. 25.- Messrs. Brown, Shipley, and Co., the agents for the United States' mail steamers, have notiied that the steamship Quaker City wbuld he despatched - from New York on the 16th inst., with the usual mails, in the place of the Pacific. Shemsty be expected to arrive hereon Wednesday next.
-THR- ADJOURNED INTCUEST -O MR. ,:SADLEIB, M.P. - I . Yeste.-day at 11 o'clock Mr. Wakley, tho coroner for Middlesex, and the jury- resimed, at' the workhouse in Hampstead,tthe inquest adjourned from Tuesday last, on the body of Mr. John Sadleir, M.P. for Sligo,. who was found dead on Hampstead-heatli on the morning of Sunday week, under circumstances whicE left no doubt that he had died by his own hand.- It will be recollected that the -inquest vas adjourned at the requesb of the jury to aliobi time for the production of certain letters written b_* the deceased on the night preceding his death to Mrs. James Sadleir, his sister-in-law, in- Ireland, Mr. Roberb Keating, M.P. for Waterford, one o£ his' most intimate friends, and Mr. Noxris, a solicitor in Bedford-row, who had algo been on terms of intimacy with him, which letters, it was cx-. pected, wouldthrow some light on the state of mind of theI deceased almost up to the very time when he committed theact of self-destruction. ' ' Mrr. William T. Manning, coroner of the Queen's Household and the Verge, was again in attendance on the part of the rdatives of the deceased, some of whom were present,' as were also several of his personal acquaintances and others with whom he had been in the habit of transacting business. 3-r. Manning, addressing the coroner, said he should state shortly the course which it was proposed to pursme. The letters which the jury had expressed a wish to see at their last sitting were now in court, in pursuance of the summons of the coroner. Mr. Keating was in attendance, and would produce the letters written by the deceased to lsim on the night preceding his death, andalso the letter written by the deceased on that night to M1rs. James Sadleir, his sister-in-law, in Ireland. Mr. 'Torris was -also present, and would produce the letter written by the deceased to him on. the same evening. He (Mr. Manning) proposed to hand them to the coroner, and it would be for him and the jury to deal with them as they thought'right. Under ordinary circumstances he should have contended thatthose letters, written under such peculiar circumstances, ought to have been excluded from the public; but, looldiug to the serious nature of this case, he was instructed i to say, on behalf of the family of the deceased, that they had no wish that anything calculated to throw light on the inquiry should in any way be concealed, and that it was their desire that an open and complete explanation of all the circumstances should be made, so far as they were concerned. As regarded the letter to Mr. Norris, he would state the course that gentleman intended to take. That was a letter written under peculiar circumstances-- The Coroner (interrupting) said Mr. Norris mnst, of course, be subject to the rule of court, and must not propose to himself any course of conduct. His course of conduct must be prescribed for him. He believed Mr.. Norris had better be caUed first. He (the coroner) would look over the letters before they were read in open court, and then determine wheother they should be openly read or not. He was quite certain that was the course which ought to be adopted in a case of this kdnd, and he must take upon himslf the responsibility of it. Mtr. Manning acquiesced in the suggestion of the coroner, and Mr. Anthony Norris, solicitor, of No. 9, Bedford-row, a witness examined at the previous sitting of the Court, was re-called, and, inreply to questions put by the Coroner,said,IleftMr. Sadleir a little afterll o'clock oi the night of Saturday, the 16th inst., preceding the Sunday morning onwhich he was found dead. I had been with him on that occasion about half-an-hour. While I was with him he received a telegraphic message from Dublin,which he showed to me. I have not got that message with me. It was a reply to a telegraphic message which he had sent from the Reform Club in a former part of that evening. I don't think the receipt of the message made.any great impression on his mind.. He read it,' and then threw it over to me to read. The letter, a copy of which I am about to produce, is in the handwriting of the deceased. The original letterrefers to the names of parties unconnected with this inquiry, and its production before the public might cause injury to them. I am acting under the advice of counsel, and I wish to hand ina- eact, literal copy of that letter, with the omission merely of the names of those parties. The Coroner said he should require to see the originaL (It was handed to him by the witness, and he read it privately.) There were names of persons, he continued, s.ddressing the jury, in that letter who were stated by the deceased to have been grievously injured by his acts, and It would be still greater injury to those unfortunate persons to have their names made public. He. should therefore take upon himself the responsibility of not maldng them public, for nothing could be more undesirable. Several of them were said to have been ruined by his viUlany. The letters would therefore be read by the witness, omitting merely the names of those persoxi4 Mr. Norris, the witness, then read the letter, which was as follows, omitting the names "Saturday Xight. "I can not live-I have umied too many-I coud not live ansd see their agony-I have committed diabolical crimes mnknown to any human being. They will now appear. bringoing my family and others to distress-causingtoall shame and grief that they should have ever known me. " I blame no one, but attribute all to my own infamous hundreds of others med by my-illany. I couldg through any torture as a punishment for my crimes. No torture could be too much for such crimes, but I can not live to see the tortures I inflict upon others. "J. S,%DLErs. "Telegraph to-, and otherwise when you read this." Witness added, in reply to the coroner, that the deceased told him during their interview on the Saturday night that some shares had been sent up to his house, and he had them there that evening. He acted for the deceased professionally in one trust in which he was concerned, and was not otherwise his solicitor. Mr. Robert Keating, LF. for Waterford, was next called. He said, in answer to the Coroner, I reside at Clapham, Surrey, and was intimately acquaintea with the late Mr. Sadleir. On Sunday morning, the 17th inst., I received two letters addressed by him to me. I saw him last in the city on the Saturday, about 5 o'clock, the even'ng before his death. I saw him-on business at No.2, NFicholasi-lane, the ofices of Messrs. Willdnson, Gurney, and Stevens. He exhibited considerable excitement in consequence of the critical position of the Tipperary JointStock Bank. I was with him about half an hour. I dlid not hear that he had been made aware then of any gentleman going to Dublin. I heard in the -morning that one of 'the firm of Wilkinson, Gurney, and Stevens was going over to Dablin, but I don't recollect that Mr. Sadleir's name was mentioned in connexion with that visit. I have the letters by me which Mr. Sadleir wrote tome on the Saturday night. In justice to myself I would say it is painful to me to produce them, inasmuch as I consider them private and confidentiaL The Coroner said he regretted as much as any one the necessity for their production; but in aU probability they were written after 11 o'clock on the night preceding his death, and were probably his last acts before that of selfdestruction. It was therefore highly desirable that they should be produced, seeing that they might throw some light on the state of mind of the deceased at that time. Mr. Keating said he should hand them in to the Coroner, and he would make what use of them he thought right. The letters were then given to the Coroner, and, having been read by him in private, ho asked if the Tipperary Bank had stopped payment, to which Mr. Eeating replied in the aillrmative. - - - The Coroner said if the Tipperary Bank had not failed, he should certainly not have allowed the letters, some of which contained references to that bank, which would otherwise have been injurious to it, to be read. Mr. Keating then read the letters vritten to him by the deceased as follows, the punctuation and the words initalics being the deceased's own - ' " Dear Robert,-James sent me over his title deeds of Coohammick and Eilconnell-I have not used these deeds in any way. I gave J. Gurney a letter from James, in. trusted to ma by him-which J. Gurney had sent tohhimThis letter can not be icted on by J. Gurney without my Brother's express authority. JOIgN S, DLF .

That letter contained the following telegraphic message:- "Forwarded from Dublin station, and received at the Strand station Febrary 16, 1.85G. -" From James Sadleir, 30, Mfermon-square (South), Dublin, to John Sadleir, Esq., MP., Reform Club, Pallmall, London.-All right at all the branches-only a few small thirns refused, there. If from twenty to thirty thousand over here on Monday morning all is safe." - Witness (to Mr. Maining) sad he found, on applying to Mfr. Uzielli, that nothing was due upon the'draught mentioned inthe letter which had just been read, and that that gentleman had antidipated the request to have it cancelled. The " J. Gurney" arned in: the ietter was lately one of the firm of Wilkinson, Gurne;, and Stevens. The Coroner said in the letter which the witness world ,iexttad names -were given of parties who were stated by the writer to be innocent. One of the gentlemen so referred' to was m the room, and he (the Coroner) Ehould -certaainy -Dot aUow his name to be read if he objected to it. - Witness then read- the Jetter. as foll9ws, Mr. Norris, to wihoni allusioiwas made by the Coroier, having waied all objection to his name being read in public:- *"1, Gloster Terrace, 16 Febraary, 1856.

"J. SADLEUS. " Robert Keating, Esq., M3P., Shamroque-lodge, Clapham."' The reading of this letter produced a great sensation in court. The witness himself was much affected, and whon he came to the touching reference by the deceased to6his aged father and mother his emotion became so great that he was obliged to pause til it had subsided. Witness proceeded to say that he had applied to Mrs. James Sadleir for the letter written by the deceased to her (his sister-in-law) on the night preceding his death. He would read that lady's letter, if the Coroner wished it. The Coroner-thought it desirable. Witness read- "Dublin, Feb. 23, 1856. "Dear 3Mr. Keating,-I only received your letter on Wldnesday, the 20th inst., here, this morning. I now enclose you the letter I received"from poor, unfortunate John Sadleir. It may throw some light on the state of his mind at the time he wrote it. As you will perceive, he neither addresses me in his usual manner nor even adds his signature. "Please be careful of the encloied letter, and retuirit' to me, -- : - - "Believe-nie' ours sincerely, "VESe2 ,E SAnurm. "Robert Reating, Esq., MP., 21, Lomb;aid-' street, I.ondom. The enclosure, which witness said was in the handwriting of the deceased, was as follows:- | "James is not to ,blame-I alone have caused all this dreadful ruin. "1 James was to me too fond a Brother but he is not to blame for bemg deceived and led astray by my diabolical acts. " Be to him at this moment all the support you can. Oh what would I not suffer with' gladness to save those vwhm I have ruined. " My end will prove at least that I was not callous to their agony." i Witness, in reply to the Coroner, said, in compliance with the deceaseds request, he had taken 7possession of his letters and property, except the papers which he left at Mr. Wil. kinsonus, of which Mr. Morrogh, solictor, of Denmarkstreet, Dnblin, had taken the care. Mlr. Josiah Wilkinson, of the firm of Wilkinson, Gurneyg and Stevens, solicitors, 2, Nicholas-lane, said,-The deceased came to me on the 'morning of Saturday preceding his death, and suggested that I could raise some, money with the view of assisting the Tipperary Bank. He showed me Some telegraphic messages he had received from Ireland on the subject of their wants. He had several schemes by which he thought I could assist him in raising money; but, after going into them, I told him I could not help him, the schemes being such as I could not recommend or adopt. He then became very excited, put his hand to his head, and said, "Good God, if the Tipperary Bank should fail the fault wil be entirely mine, and I shall have been 'the ruin of hundreds and thousands." He walkel adbout the office in a very excited state, andurgedme to try and help him, because, he said, he could not live to see the pain and ruin infLicted on others by the cessation of the bank The interview ended in this, that I was unab!e to assist him in his plans to raise moncy. He had not been In the habit of coming into my office for a considerable time until a few days before his death, we having had some difference. My partner, Mr. Stevens, went to Dublin that (Saturdayevening, at my suggestion, with a security or deed belonging to me, which Iwanted registered there. I should state that Mr. Sadleir has written to me from time to time to pay sums of money for him, which I have done, and some of which he had repaid me. The money, notwithstanding, which I had advanced for him at length became so large in amount that I asked him to give me a security for it, which he did. About six weeks before he died I re membered that the security was not registered, and, when I found the Tipperary Bank was in difficulty I determined to have it registered. It was with that view that I requestel my partner to take it to Dublin. On arriving there he found it to be a forgery. The security he lodged with me purported to be a deed given on the purchase of an estate in the Encumbered Estates Court. It was signed by two of the commissioners of that court and by two attesting witnesses in two different pa-ts of the deed, and not a single signature was genuine. (Sensation.) It had a genuine seal of the Encumbered Estates Court attached to it, and the commissioners themselves admit the *eal to be genuine. That seal might have been transferred from some other genuine deed to the spurious one, because the seal of the courb is not impressed on the document or in wax, baton a large wafer;and attached to, it. There - s such an estate as the deed purports to convey to me. I have heard thata large sum of money was given to the de. ceased in my offlce on the Saturday before he died. I have not heard auything of it since. It is not a matter of which I have any personal knowledge. I cannot say who told me of that circumstance, there have been so many rnmours about the matter. The Coroner said the witness might perhaps be aware that in cases of this kind an inquiry into property was a legitimate portion of the investigation, and might be carried infinitely further than he had yet carried this inquiry. Witness repeated that he knew nothing of his own knowledge of the matterto which the Coroner referred. Mrr. Sadleir came in and out of his (witness's) office once or twice on the Saturday, and every time lie saw him he was in the greatest possible excitement. HIe (witness) attributed his death to his excitement about the Tipperary Bank and to his knowledge that he (witness) was about to send his deed over to Dablin for registration. A great miny rnuours were afloat about forged deeds, but he (witness) Inew of no other forged deed than his own. Several of Mr. Sadleir's deeds had, from [time to time, passed through his hands to persons who had advanced money upon them; but he (witness) had no reason to believe that any one of those deeds was not genuine. He did not think there was a single person who had the deceased's conifidence. He was a most reserved man. It was extremely difficulty to get any information from him beyond -what he choee to impart. Ho believed Mfr. Sadleir had written the letters which had been produced under great excitement. He (witness) knew much of his affairs, and he believed there was much in those letters that was not correct. The Coroner said that statement would give rise to a most important question; and he asked Mr. Manning, as the representative of the family of the deceased, if he was prepared to show that Mr. Sadleir's own statements as to his forgeries and crimes, - and the rain and misery he had heaped upon others, were delusions. Mr. Manning replied that he was not. All the informsa, tion inhis possession was now before the Court. - ' - The Coroner said, if Br. Manning had been prepared to slhow that, the testimony would be most important. The failure of the Tipperary Bank was a reality, as was also the forged':deed, but they had had no evidence of any other crimes committed by the deceased. Mr. Keating said up to that moment no document appeared to have turned up to bear out the deceased's state' I ments of his forgeries, except that of Mr.Wilkineona What' might hereafter be discovered it was impossblo to say. ' i Mr. Norris here stated' that Mfr. Gunmey had told him 'that he gave Mr. Sadleir 13,000!. in banlnotes before he left the city on the Saturday afternoon before his death. - (o trace of this sum hasq sinco been discovered.) - Mr. Keating said the deceased had told him there was a 1,OOO.-notsi among his -money, but that, had not been ftfoind. , -. The Coroner saidit was importint to know whether the e6tatements of Mr. Sadleir respecting hinmelf were founded in fact. ad' he 6ommittWd the erimes and offences which boimputidto himself?f EFhe bid not, the jury could 'scarcely have any hesitation in' concludirg 'that he was a man of unsound mixid,'aud' acting under delusion's'at the ine he destroyed himself. He was prepared to ad journ the: inquiry for -the--)urpo ofl obtaining fuiher testimony on that poinbt if the-jury or the friends of the deceased; desired 'that- he dsiouldl do so. T.he question of property was an exceodinkliimportantore iin this case, because if Mr. Sadlei haddestroyedbinscifwhile o Of sound mind he had committed self-inurder, and his property, whatever it might be, would be -forfeited to the CrownL ' The deceased said he had been goilty of number-: less crimnes of a' diabolical chariater, and the cause -of ruin, misery, .and distress to thousands Land tens o'f .thousan.d of persons.- After looking at the evidence,with the. greatest possible care and attention; he -(the Coroner)' confessed he coild see, up to this point, no signs of'insanity in the deceased whatever; but if it should be' iltimately proved that the letters whiuh had been put in were written under the delusionthat he had committed. offences which, inreality, he had not ommitted,that would be conclusive evidenoe that he was -man of Insound t minda Under those circumstances he 'thought it woild be desirable, to adjoum the inquest foranother week - The Crown, vith regard to property in such cases, united the powers of the Court of Chancery and the courts of common larw.: There was hardly, in fact, any power more potent or more' pungent than that which the Crown possessed in the case of persons who had committed the crime of fcne ee SC. Ex cept on the hypothesis which had been suggested, he realy could see nothing in the evidence, so far as it had gone; iwhich could lead to the conclusion that the deceased was a; man of unsound mind at the time he destroyedhimself. Underthosecircumstances he thought it due to him and his fanmily and to the interests of society vt large that an opportunity should be given forfurther inquiry. The inquest was then adjourned until Taesday, the llth of March, at 11 o'clock.

ALLEGED MUrDERS AT PoBnTSrou -Wiiam Ansell, the man apprehended on the charge of shooting his wife with a pistol on Friday night, was e-xamined before the Portsmouth magistrates yesterday. The evidence given was chiefly in corroboration of the facts ahready stated. The prisoner previously had quarrelled with his wife. Ho had beaten her, and she stated to a neighbour, Mrs. ForriAl that she was afraid something would occur, and requested help if 'such should be the case. On Friday night the witness heard the cry of " Murder" twice. The last words she heardl were, " Make mny peace,' end then came the report of a pistoL On going upstairs the witness found the deceased lying on the floor, which was bloody. The prisoner said, "1 Oh, Mrs. FerralL, Inever did it ; it was done by accident." From the testimonv of other witnesses itappeared that angry words had passed between the pri. sonerand thedeceasedduringthelast fortniughtTheprisoner hiad accounted for the possession of the pistol by rayinjg, 7that 'he had bought it to protect the shrine or altaiplece betore alluded to, and he had said he would shoot anv man or woman whom he found on his Rremises after dar. Sbmia thieves had attempted to break into -his house about a fortnight previously. On another occasion the pisoner had tod hIf. vife that he intended the contets of the pistl for: 'her, if she did not behavo hersef. A surgeon stated that the death of the deceased was caused by a pistol ball, a~nd mid he did not believe that the deceased could have in. flicted the wound lierself. The prisoner, -who reserved his defence, was committed for trial for wilful murder.
