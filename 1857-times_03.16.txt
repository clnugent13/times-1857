Thia Company is establIshe-d to work the Dim Motnatair Copper Mines, tin the province of Nelson, New Zealand, and within ten minues of that port.
Thesecoines were dlroTered in the early part ot the Yearlss2,b mineral surveyor of considerable experience, wrho reported the
covery to the New Zealand GoTernment, uPon Whichi steps were taken byrtheautlroritles. saswell sas by the inhabitants of Nelson, to have care. fut surveys made of the disirict, with a Tiew topoe the exist-ene of the mlneral products thus breugcht to their notice The reeult of the exploration. mades by the Government geologist, and confirmed by other mineral sureyors, was satisfactory. Sir George Crey, the then Governor, directed the ublication of the same in the Government Gazette of 29th June, 152 ; antdacoompany wa conaecuentlyfrm..ed at Nelson, on the 8th of October, in the same year uDX = er the titeot the " Cooke' Strait Mining Company." The resources of the colony being very limited, the promoters determined to despatch an agent to England to raise the amount necessary for the successfu oengOf
the mines This pentleman reached England in March, IS58 the 'Pre-
cise period of the declaration ot war with Russia, and therefore MI mnost inopportune moment for promoting the Tiews of the Nelsaon olonists. Nsevertheless, induoed by the Ter favourable specimens which were brouht over, b the high cbaracter of the parties he represenited In tho colony, a3 well a the documents transmitted by them, the gen.- tlemem whose names appear upon the Disection, with others, pr chased the freehold, with mineral rights,. of a prton of theDu Mountahsaand ad5acent lands Pr~ abu 3, 7 acres.
To ascartamn fuuther the vaue of the -ines, a stagf of 28 men with ample materials for prorecusing the works, were deepatched ; and,-on their arrival in New Zealand, titeir attention was direte to the existence of the lo-des in an elevatod part of the miountain, from whbich eight tons of ore were extracted and sent orer to this oountry, and found to contain a percentage of 171 of fine copper.

Loiter from Mewire, Henry Bath and Son.
Mining-office Swansea, March 10, 1857.
Dear Slr,-In reply to Your favour of the 6th inst., we beg to mate the followingremarksi on the 40 bsap of copper ore received from yoaLr MIre on thej DunL Mountain, New Zeaano.
The contents of these bags evidently consisted of the whole of the work-Ing of the lode, without any attempt at dressing.
We dressed them by picking as well as we were able, and obtained about one-third which yielded 231 per cent. fine copper of the total quantity we set aside, theo earthy portlons and refause weighing about hoswt. ; but even this contained abouit gpr cent. ofcODpper ; the whole of thie0bagioontained onan average 10 Percent.
There were several portions of rich oxide, and even pieces ot mnetallie opper, hut on this we lay no great streas; the meoet encouLraging feature in the matter is the fact, that the ore consisted prin. cipslly of mry onlphuret, and that the coDpper is well diffused through the mass, instead of being in rich luimps,
It Is further satisfactory that theo ore has been found In the same localty, but at sonic distwance from Your o:igloal workings in the Dun Mountain, an evidence that thLe copper exists in quantities In that miountain, and that this last lot, worke-d lower down the mountain,usn. dstst in a mauch larger proportion of suiphuret than the former let.
On the whole, we should say that tha Indicatious are Increasingly favourable to lour prospects, and, aa on a former occasion we expressed an opinion that there ws quite sufficient inducement to make a trial, ad that has osicured srnse haa only confirmed casin the correctniess of that opinion, and of the advisability of going further than yout hive yet, done in working the mine.
We remain, yomsa truly

THE SPEAKER'S RETIREMENT.
The report on the annuity of 4,000h. to the Speaker on his Yetilrmmat was brought up and agreed to, and a BiU founded on the report was subsequently brought in by the CHANCELOR of the ExcHETQUER, and 9gnd a firgt tim,
MUTINY BILL.
On the motion that this BiU be read a second time,
Mr. HENLEY observed that two new clauses had been added to the Bill, and, as they had only been circulated that morniDg, he wished the Under Secretary for War to state their effect.
Mr. PEEL sad, that the greater part of the changes that bad been introduced into the Bill were of a military character, and had been ayproved by the Commander-in-Chief. There was one alteration, however, which would exempt private houses in Scotland from the liability of billeting Eoldiers, as it was considered to be a great oppression. (Hear, hear.) That alteration had been introduced in accordance'with a resolution which had been adopted by the House of Commons last session. Its effect would of course be to assimilate the law of Scotland to that of England with respect to billeting in private houses.
Mr. W. EWART gave notice of his intention to propose some amendments in committee with respect to billeting in Scotland.
Mr. G. DUNCAN thanked the Under-Secretary for War for the alteration which he had introduced -with regard to Scotland, because he was convinced that the existing system of bileting there was injurious, not only to the military but also to those upon whom they were billeted. Some of the barracks in Scotland had been closed for years-one of them for so long as the last 50 years-but be hoped that step would be immediately taken to reopen them again for the service of the army.
After a few words from General CODnusZGTON,
Mr. PACKE said, that licensed victuallers complained that temperance hotel-keepers were unfairly exempted from the liability of billeting.
The Bill was then read a second time.
MARINE MUTINY BILL. This Bil was also read a second time.
SAVINGS-BANKS BILL.
Mr. S. ESTCOURT regretted that the dissolution of Parliament would necessitate the withdrawal of a Bill in which every art of the country was interested-namely, the Savings-tanks Bill which had been brought in by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. That right hon. gentleman had permitted him to peruse its provisions, and he was ' to say that the Bin would be a great amendment of the
isting law. He therefore hoped that immediately after the assembling of the next Parliament the right hon. gentleman would introduce the same Bill, and that its provisions would be well considered during the forthcoming recess, in order that when it was brought in again no a?ppeals might have to be made for its postponement. The humblest classes of Her Majesty's subjects were deeply interested in the passing of the Bill, and he rejoiced that at last, after so many futile attempts on this subject, they would have the means afforded to them of investing their hard-earned savings without any risk.
Mr. H. HERBERT concurred in the observations of the hon. gentleman. He did not think that there was a single Chancelor of the Exchequer who had sat on the Treasury bench during the last seven years who had not promised to amend the law as to savings-banks, but until the introduction of the BiU in questionthere was no likelihood of the fulfilment of these promies. If the BiU should pass it would enable the industrious classes to accumulate their savings without the risk of having to suffer such calamities as were occasioned by the failure of the TipperAry and other savings.
The CEANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said, the Housewas wellawarehowmeritoriously the hon. memberfor Wiltshire had devoted his attention to, and with how great authority he spoke upon, the subject of savings-banks. He accepted, therefore, with great satisfaction the testimony which the hon. gentleman had given in favour of his Bi
It was certainly his intention, in the event of his having a seat In the next Parliament, to reintroduce it in as nearly as possible its present shape. He therefore sincerely hoped that managers and others interested in the question of savings-banks would, during the next two months, fauy consider its provisions, in order tat i progress in the next Parlamet miht e fcintted Hesympathized wvith those persons wgho haed fsufifeired by the falre of thzed saings banks to which the hon. member for lKerry hadalluded, and hoped that the provisions of Ihis Bill would afford a suffacient guarantee against such failures in future.
r The Exchequer-bills Bin and the Consolidated Fand Appropriation Bill were severally read a first time, and ordered to be read a second time on Monday.
The House adjourned at 25 minutes past 1 o'clock.

Saturday Evening.
The English funds remain weak, owing to the i demand for specie, which no arrivals seem to mati.fy. Consols opened and closed at the dull quotations of yesterday, and at one time during the morning exhibited a considerable increase of heaviness. The first transactions for money were at 93P to i, whence they declined to 93. A reaction then occurred, and the last prices were again 93 to + for money, and 931 to J for the April account. Iindia Stock left off at 221 to 223; Exchequer-bonds, 98s to -; India-bonds, 3s. discount to par; and Enchequer-bills, par to 3s. premium.
In the Stock-Exchange to-day the rate for short loans on Government securities was 54 to 6 per cent. In the discount market and at the Bank there was a very heavy general demand, and it is again becoming evident that when the dividends fall due, a large proportion of them will have to be carried back to the Bank in repayment for advances.
There were few transactions in foreign securities, and prices at the close were rather heavy. Operations in Turkish Six per Cents. took place at 9789 96*, and 971. In the Four per Cents. Guaranteed the business was at 100g. The other bargains comprised :-Brazilian Five per Cents., 103; New Granada Active, 23; Mexican, 23 ; Portuguese Three per Cents., 45ft; Sardinian Five per Cents., 91; Spanish Three per Cents., 411 and A, the New Deferred, 24*; Dutch Two-and-a-Hlilf per Cen*s., 65k; and the Four per Cent. Ce.'tilicates
The final quotations of the French 'Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 70f. 90c. for money, and 71f. 20c. for the end of the month, showing a recovery of a quarter per cent. The Government resoluton trebling the tax on share transfers appears, therefore, to have been well received.
A further sum of 92,0001. in gold was withIrawn from the Banlk to-day for exportation to me, t the increased purchases of silver consequent upoII h., last advices from India and China.
The Admiral has arrived from Port; Philip wi
40,689 ounces of gold and 4d,0(',0 -svereigns, making a total of 202,7561. fhe i.jJr steamer from the coast of Africa has brought 1,500 ounce3 valued at 6,0001.
Despatches from Constautinople to-day give the details of the roncession for the Turkish RNational Bank, and they appear on the whole perfectly sound and satisfactory. The capital is to be 10,000,0001., with power to increase to 12,000,0001., in shares of 201. each, with 51. paid, the right of subscription being equally divided between Turkey, Germany, France, and England. The institution is to have power to imsue bank post bills and to transact every description of exchange and banking business. It is likewise to have the privilege of issuing notes to any amount not exceeding 15,000,0001., on condition of one-half being secured by a reserve of specie. The Board of management isto consist of a president, vice-president, ana 24 directors, of whom the president, 'vice-president, and six directors are to be chosen by the Government, the remaining 18 directors being nominated in the first instance by the contractors, and after three years by the shareholders. Weekly accounts are to be published, and a general balance is to be taken every six months after the manner of the Bank of England. All differences between the Government and the Bank are to be settled by arbitration, and special clauses are introduced guaranteeing the exclusive right of issue throughout the Turkish empire and providing for the punishment of forgery, for the better recovery of debts, &c., for military protection, and for exemption from taxes. The Government are to give the land for the banking-house, and to pay for the building at the termination of the concession, which is to be for 30 years, with one year's notice, and reimbursement of all advances. The Bank, at the request of the Government, are to undertake its account, and any temporary loans they may make on Exchequerbills in anticipation of revenue are to bear interest [at a rate not exceeding 6 per cent. They are to
commence operations within six months from the date of the firman, and meanwhile the caution money is fixed at 200,0001. The first and most important duty to be performed will be that of restoring the currency. According to estimate, there is at present in circulation 2,500,0001. of interest; bearing paper, 2,500,0001. of paper without interest, and 2,000,0001. or more of depreciated coinage, making a total of 7,000,0001. The first is to be withdrawn in six months, the second in 15 month. and the third gradually, the Government granting to the Bank 6 per cent. transferable bonds secured by specific revenues for the amounts furnished. From these particulars it is plain that the Government have carefuly weighed all the conditions to which they haveacceded, and, while avoiding improvident commitments, have endeavoured to lay a basis that may enable the Bank to take a solid and becoming rank among the financia1 establishmentsof Europe. Amongspecultorsaground of complaint will probably be found in the provision that the reserve of gold against the note circulation is to amount to one-half, but,althoughunder ordinary circumstances a third has usually been considered ample, no prudent persons wil regret that the leaning has been towards extreme precaution. With regard to management it may be assumed the Board wil be composed proportionably of the representatives of the shareholders in the various subscribing countries, actuated by a sufficient diversity of interests to prevent the evils of any individual sway, and who will at the same time be under the] eye, although not the control, of the resDonsible nominees of the State. These several bodies, moreover, will be able to reckon upon the concerted action of their Governments for the preservation of their rights, and hence, with the arrangements made for the publicity of accounts and the watchfulness, politicaI and mercantile, certain to be bestowed on all the transactions of the establishment, there seems, as far as its constitution is concerned, every ground to look upon it with confidence.
It is stated that the Directors of the Riga Railway have received inteligence of the success of their negotiations for a concession from the Russian Government fully maintaining the terms oriinally anticipated. Should this proveto be the case, their position will be very different to that of the contractors for the 45,000,0001. project, and it wiU be lnteresting to observe how the latter will reconcile themselves to the disparity. The official documents are shortly expected, and the full particulars will then be announced.
The railway meetings of the week have not been numerous, but they have comprised one or two leadingcompanies. ThesharholdersoftheEastKenthave authorized the directors to exercise their borrowing powers to the extent of 233,3001., and to make arrangements for the issue of the remaining Dover Extension shares. The inhabitants of Eerne-bay have passed resolutions in favour of the Eerne-bay and Fiaversham line, and regret is expressedthat the South-Eastern Company intend toopp the Bill. The dividend of the Glasgow and SouthWestern Railway is at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum, and the report has been adopted as satisfactory. The traflic continues to be steadily developed, and endeavonr are being made to exercise increased econ:omy. At the Great NTorthern meeting the discussion was principaly directed to the frauds of Leopold Red~n. ~ediiden hasbeensuspnded andit a
patjbl. -The divdend has beern suspende-r-n t a been agreed to leave the balance of 243,9231. to be
appied to meet the late loss in such manner as the directors may consider conducive to the interests of the company through the instrumentality of a Bill in Parliament. A committeehas also been appointed to investigate the accounts and the registration department. At the West London meeting
the report, after some opposition was adopted and a dividend of 21. per share on tAe first-class smares was declared. The report of the East Anglian Company has been agreed to, and the resut show a general and progressive increase of traffic. The dividends declored have been at the rato of 6 per cent. per annum on the B Stock, and 41 per cent.
on the a Stock; and the directors have been authorized to consolidate the A shares, 21. paid,
into a 7 per cent. Stock, smbject to no further calls. The Duraley and Mdland Junction report has received the sanction or the proprietors, and as the line has been opened only three months the balance of revenue will be carried forward. The dividend of the Furness Railway has
been confirmed at the rate of 8 per cent. per annum, and tha traffic shows a satisfactory inrease. The directors of the N'ewcastle and Carlile Company, having paid an intermediate dividend at the rate of 21. lOs. on the 1001. shares, recommend a further dividend at the rate of 3S. per share, thus maling the payment for the year 1. 1l.-per cent, A meet-
ing of merchants has taken place at Manchtstor in favour of the Honduras Interoceanic Railway, MNLr. E. G. Squier, the representative of the companyj explaining the advantages of the proposed route. The report of the Cornwall Railway, which has been carried; states that the works, especially those of the Royal Albert Bridge, have been prosecuted with vigour. Negotiations have been opened with the associated companies who are to work the line to enable the directors to raise 300,0001. on preference shares to complete the route from Plymouth to Truro, and to open it for traffic. The proposed dividend of the Caledonian Railway is at the rate of 3& per cent. per annum, which will absorb 53,4421. and leave 6,5311.
The prospectus has been issued of the Dtin Mountam Copper Mining Company, with a capital of 75,0001. in 1Z. shares. The property consists of 1 687 acres of land on the Dun Mountain, New Zealand, where lodes have been discovered yielding a large percentage of copper. 6,000 of the paidup shares are to be given to promoters in New Zealand, and 20,000 to promoters and* owners in England, in payment for the freehold and to meet past expenses. The remaining 44,000 are for distribution.
A balance-sheet of the London and Paris Bank, which was lately projected and abandoned, has been issued to the shareholders. To meet 18,000!. of unreturned calls there appears to be only 4,7671., the expenses of the preliminary steps for the formation of the concern having amounted to the extraordinary total of 14,4221. The law charges are stated at 3,5981., the expenses of deputatibns at 1,186!., direction and salaries 6,353L., and office rent, furniture, and alterations at 1,06!. J-udging from this scale of outlay the shareholders will have reason to congratulate themselves that they drew back from the enterprise at the earliest possible OPpROUitniy.
Tho Pentnsular and Oriental steamer Sultan, to sail o.L the 17th, has 25,0001. in bar gold already engavged for Cadiz.

At Carnarvonshire Slate meeting a resolution was passed authorizing tho directors to raise a sum not exceeding 10,0001. upon deben. tures, bearing interest at 5 per cent. per aunum.'
With regard to foreign mining adventure there is nothing worthy of extract.
THE BUDGET.-It has rarely been our lot
THE BuDGyT.-It has rarely been our lot to see so much mystification about a simple and clear propasition ash bnthrown around the budget of Sir Ceorge C. Lewls by th subsequent discussions which have taken place in Parliament upon it. The terms of the finanial plan of the Chancellor of the Exchequer were such as were easily understood by the most ordinary intellect. The objections taken to it have been numerous, but so con. tradictory that if carefully analyzed they might fairly be left to answer each other. According to the actual state of the law Sir George Lewis found himself in possesdon of an Income-tax for another year of lad. in the pound, and he found certain reductions assigned to the articles of tea and sugar. In place of standing upon his position as the law made it, he took the wiser and more natural course; ho ascertained what would be the requirements of the coming year, and, giving up all pretension to strict legal rights, he proposed a plan which, upon the whole, would raise in the most equitable and least oppressive manner the required amount. According to a Parhamentary return, he found that the war had left behind it claims ar gsin directly out of it to the amount of 3,671,0001. in 1857-of 4~824,0001. ini 1858 -and of 4,707,0001. in 1859. In providing for these war obligations he adopted the same plan which had been taken, first by Mr. Gladstone, and afterwards by himself-namely of dividing them fairly between direct and indirect taxation, and in selecting the indirect taxes, which he proposed to bear a small,pert, he adopted those which M1r. Gladstone himself had decled in Parlament to be the least objectionable. But, fortanately for the comnmunity, the taxes proposed; bethi direct and indirect, were in themselves a reductioni upon theexisting rates. The income-tax was brought down at onoe to 7d.; tne tea duty from ls. 9d. to Is. od. per lb.; and the sugar duties were reduced about Is. er cwt. The result of t is t-hat, in exchange for a reduction of the income-tax by no leassthan 9d. in the pound, the commaunity are asked to submit to the smaller reduction of 4d. in the lb
in place of the larger reduction of 6d. which would otherwisehavetaken pleafter the 5th of April in the duty on tea; and in like manner to the smaller reduction of Is. the cwt. in place of 2s. in the daty on suaar. One would have expected that apropotion sompe and so advantageous to th public would have met with general and m- mediate acquiescence in Parliament, s tdid in the aountdi
But no. On the onehanditwasargued that theplanwold create great deficences In future years, on the other, although by the same persons, that it was objectionable, because it imposed new tases, orrather postponed for a little time the decline of exlsting taxes to the lowest point pro. vided by law. Those who held this contradictory langaage, thou the never stated it distincty, could only meanat the no or of the Exchequer should have kept his full income-tax, and have left the tea and sugar dutiesun touched. To say nothing of the impolicy,.nay, after the expression of public opinion, of the lm naybili, of carrte ing such a scheme, let us see what would have been the effect even bad it been carried. We have already stated what were the war obligations of the next three years. If the full Income-tax for the next year had been exacted, it would have left a surplus, fter th whole demands of the year, of fully 3,oOO,06 -,w.ich according to law, must have been handed over to the Com. miniaoners of the National Debt and used in the ordinar
way for the redemption of stock. But that would not in the slightest degree have relieved the country from the payments of the bonds and other war obhiations falling due in the two suceeaingyom. If, then the income-tax had been permitted to drop to d. for 1 a53 and 1859, no provision whatever would be made for those obligations. We should thus find ourselves in the absurd position of Paying
high war income.tax in1857 of 16d; of creating thereby a surplus of upwards of 3,500,000l, which could not be appled to the war obligations, but to the redemption of ordiny deb; and then in the two following years we should ho without any means whatever for mecting those oblgations. Taxes toan enormous amount would be im posed wrhen not requred, and no means would be provided for the bendsof 1858 and 1859 when they fell due. But, indep,endent of the obvious merit of Sir G. Lewis's plan of providing revenue only when wanted, and only to the extent wranted, it has the further merit of effecting a large balance gofs av gtothecountry. Suppose theplauhadheen adopted of letting the law take its course-of charging, as Xr Gladstone would appear to think ought to have been done, the 16d. income-tkx next year, and the sd. income-tax in the two follown years, the whole Amount paid during that period would be 2g. 2d. in the pound; where-as under the proposal of Sir George Lewis to impose 7d. for three years, the whole amount paid wil be only 21d.- leaving a difference in favour of the taxpayer, as far as the income-tax is concerned, of the large sum of at least 5,000,0001. But, then it is ob4ected that the plan adopted by Sir George Lewis Is oppressive to the poor while it relieves the ricL. What is the oppression to the poor? By the law, the duty upon sugar would have falen 2s. the cwt, or about one firthing the pound; by Sir George Lewis's
roposal it will fall Is., or one-eighth of a penny less 'an it would otherwise have done. By the law as it stood, the duty on tea would have faUen 6d. the pound; by Sir Geeo Leawss proposalit will fall4d. the pound, or 2d, less than'¶t would have done- which su, if divided into ounces is inappreciable. But lord John Russell justlyremindea the House that the poor were not the only consumers of tea sad sugar; that, on tho contrary, the largest proportion is probably consmed by clas which could not be prorly included in that term. The noble lord might have gone further, and have reminded the House that it is not the rich alone who now pay the income-tsr. Under Sir Robert Peel's income-tax, when it was confined to thse havinz incomes above 15OMJ it might be regarded more in the light of a tax affecting only the easy claes; but ince it has been exteqded down to incomes of 1001. a change in the character of the tax, greater than is generaly he. lieved, has taen place; iand this will be apparent from the single fact that the number of persons brought under the t as possing incomes of 00Z. to 1501 is greater than the entire number charged under sehedule D whenthetax was confined to incomes above 1501. When, therefore, it Is known that under the plan of Sir G. Lewis, upwards of 150TT0 persoDs who pos incomes ranging from 1001. to lo0L a-year will enjoy an im mediate reduction from la. in the pound of mcome-tax to 5d.-and that at a cost of one-eighth o a penny upon
ugar, and of one-halfpenny upon the quarter pound of te4 the largest ouantityin which those cLasses usually purchse It,-wethinJl that little doubt will remain as to which of te proposed schemes Wll be the greater relief to the poor Provision having been made only for a sngle year in conse. quence of the asolution, It is evident that these discnsaons -must again be rased in the new Parliament, in order to settlerimportant questions, which cannot without great lnconvenience be left open.-Econom;j

(PR03 OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.1
DlUBLIN, SATURDAY MORhING.
Taking advantage of the present Parliamentary crisis Mr. Smith O'Brien has once more entered the political arena, and baa issued a three column address of counsel to "the People of Ireland." In Ibis lengthened effusion there is nothing very striking or original. learly all that Is said has been said and written a thouEand times over, not only by Mr. O'Brien. himself but by every Irish agitator from Daniel O'ConneU down to his humblest imitator. There is,
however, one paswage in the manifesto, the Subject-1 matter of which is just now uppermost in the public mind-namely, the conduct of Ministers in reference to Chinese affairs. The broad facts of the case, according to the authority of Mr. O'Brien, are simply these .-
"For many years the English have, contrary to tho wiEhes of the Chinese Government, carried on an immense smuggling trade in the harbours of China, inporting into tbat country a poisonous drug (to the value of many nillions sterling), which is used by the natives as a deleterious stimulus, destructive alike to their intellectual, moral, and physical energies; in carrying on this contraband trade, the protection of the British flag has been habitually afforded to smugglers and pirates; upon a question afrsing betweeen theMiceroy of Canton and the representatives of Great Britain respecting the right of foreigners to give protection to Chinese outlaws, the BXitish authorities at Hongkong usurped the prerogative which reserves to the Queen the right to declare war, and usurped the privileges which give to Paliamnent the power to Eanction such declaration of war; after having thus invaded the rights of the Queen and of the representatives of the people of their own country, they proceeded to destroy the Uves and property of an unoffending population, burning and massacring in one indiscriminate slaughter the soldier and the citizen, the women and the children of QWe of the most populous cities of the world. Beheving ,,t there is a retribution for national misdeeds both in this world and in the next, I cannot but anticipate that the vengeance of the Most Thih will overtako those who perpetrate or uphold such atrocities, and therefore earnestly pray that the Irish nation will refuse to sanction such ruthless bar. barities. Let me not be mi*construed. I do not write this letter with a view to forward the interests of one British patty rather than of another. To me all British parties ara alike. From the day when, in 1843, I joined the Repeal Association (a moment memorable on account of the suppression of the Clontarf Meeting and of the prosecution of O'Connell) until the present hour, I have held that the Irish nation ought to abstain from connecting itself with
nay English party whatsoever. A considerable change has, m eed, taken place since that time in the sentiments of the Irish people with regard to their national interests, and the pledge of fidelity to Repeal, which in May, 1845, was solemnly accepted by the municipal represnetatives of alnost every town in Ireland in the presence of the illustrious apostle of the Repead cause, appears now to be forgotten. am far from wishing to revive now a mock agitation of the Repeal question, but I owe it to truth to declare that, in retracing the history of our country luring the period which has elapsed since 1843, I find little reason for the abandonment of that pledge, except it be that situations under Government have beon offered to and accepted by several of those who were foremost in pronioting the Repeal agitation."
3fr. O'Brien then dilates at some length upon the various social changes which have occurred of late years in Ireland, and after admission, made with a very indifferent grace, that partial benefit has restulted from the operations of the Encumbered Estates Court, he proceeds in the following rather hackneyed strain of complaint .
"Living m thi, country at present under an amnesty, I eel disposed to pass lightly over everymatter fwhich touches myself, and I can leave to the future historian the task of commemoratin the holy aliance formed between Lord Clarendon andTr. Birch for the purpose of calumniating the party with which I was connected; but am I justified in aslking you to forget the provocatives by which some of the maost loyal, carln-minded, and disinterested patriots of Iraland were driven into insurrectionary proceedings? Am I justified in asking you to forget the trials of Mr. O'Connell and his fellow martyrs, the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, and the systematic packing of juries, which were sanctioned by British statesmen or by the British Parliament? Ama I justified in asking you to forget that above 600,000 of the inhabitants of Ireland were allowed to die eitber from actual starvation or from diseases generated by insufficiency of food, and that, upon tho whole, 2,000,000 of the Irish race have perished or disappeared from a soil which, under a good domestic Governmentunder suclI a Government as has existed during the last 25 years i revolutionized Belgium-viould have afforded all the elements of happiniess to a much larger population than has ever yet inhabited it Believing, as I conscientiously believe, that these, our fellow-countrymen, might either have been kept alive at home, or assisted to settle themselves advantageously in the British colonies by a Government which possesses uneqiualled resources, both pecuniary and territorial, I cannot but hold the Parliament of Great Bri. tain guilty of a deliberate design to get rid of the race to yhich you and I belong. For these reasons, not on account of any personal sufferings or indignities that Ihave endured I ani now more fully convinced than I was in 1844 that Ireland would prosper more under a domestic than under a foreign Government. These convictions haveebeenstrength. ened by the opportunities which I have enjoyed during my exile of observing the advantages of self-government in foreign countries, and even iu the colonies of Great Britain. Of course I do not mean to assert that 14 years have elapsed without witnessing the enactment of a single measure beileficial to Ireland; but, as regards the general policy of British statesmen towards this country,
at seems to me that it has consisted, not in an honest ende.avour to atone for past wrongs and to win the approval of honourable men by useful legislation, but by an appeal to the basest and most sordid passions of the Irish nation. That policy has consisted in a successful attempt to sow jealousies and divisions between the different sections of Yrish patriots, and in an attempt, equally successful, to purchase tl:e support or qiescence of those who once took a promi nent part in promoting the agitation of our national claims. Ihis purchase has been cheaply effected, for it has been only necessary to dispense juliciously a few of the subordinate situations wvhich the British Executive has at its rcoimm!and. From the Government of the empire Irishmen are still practically excluded, for seldom of late years has an Irishman been admitted into the Cabinet. Nor is it onl From the Government of the empire that they are excluded They are not allowed even to participate in the higher de partments of administration in their own country. If you will consult the official Almanac yon will find that'the enterprising Anglo-Saxon' occupies almost every administrative situation in Ireland to which either large emolument or Governmental influence is attached."
THE VACANT MASTERSHIP IN CIANCERY.
It is stated that the Lord Chancellor has addressed a communication to the Irish Government in reference to the inconvenience likely to result from the contemplated abolition of the MAlastership in Chancery vacant by the death of Mr. AVilliam buensn. This official remonstrance, it is added, has been favourably received, and it is believed that the vacancy will be speedily filled up. Two or three names of eminent lawyers have been mentioned for the appointment, but as yet nothing certain is known. The salary is 3,0001., late Irish currency.
CONSERVATIVE TACTICS.
Ov-ing in a 8reat measure to a new systeii of tactics, the handiwork of certain noble lords holding large possessions in Tipperary, that county has had the honour of giving the first victory obtained for rcany a long day by the skeleton of the Tenant League, marshalled and led to unexpected victory by 'Mr. George Henry Moore. Mr. Waldron, a gentlcnman of large property in the county, and who, although a Liberal in the widest sense, would not swallow all the pledges required by the fanatic, of ithe League, has bon most signally defeated, and an
tter stranger, without the slightest claims upon the constituenlcy, is the sccessor for at least a month or so of MVIr. James I Sadleir. Pe3session, however, is a vast gain, and, as no doubt the same game will be played over again at the elnsuing general election, it may be fairly presumed that the Conservatives will have to boast a second time of helping to create a Tenant-right party in the new House of Commons. It is only right to add that many of the Conservative gentry, headed by Sir John Craven Carden, refused(to march fn the wake of the O'Donoghue's lordly supporters, and threw the whole weight of their influenca into the scale with the view of securing the election of Mr. Waldron. A few more inch victories and to the Irish Derbyites may be attributed the merit of reorganizing the all but defunctb " Brass Band." There is as yet no official account of the final state of the poll, but it is stated that the majority of the I eaguer is considerably over 700.

There has been roochi andL raw weather, and the progress of vegeta. tion has been checked, but without detriment to its future development. The wheat plant continues tDprospr, and izabundantly thick en theground. Foodfor esttle continuesaplentiful, and, in consequence, linseed cake is again declining in value. The lambiug season has noW commenced, and, generally speaking, thaere is a Prolific produce. it is to be regretted that within the last few weeks a disease of pecularly fata character has manifested Itself in several dlockcs, and caused much havoc among them. The sheep succumb suddenly, being apparently well and healthy in the morning, drooping at nioon, anid dead before night. Mr. blather, a veterinary surgeon, mnember of the Roya Col. eze, who has examined sieveral of the sheep which have died of this disease, exPresses an opinion that thte dieease arimses fom a posonous state of the blood, and hie thinks It very probable that the artifiial manures now so generally used by agrlcultUrlets may hays something to do with. It.
The wheat trade In this district hos been, on the whole, inanimate, and last week's prices have been with difficulty maintained even for th edbeet samples. Mwlleis nferior sorts have declined in value:. Th'A heavizem is due chiefly to the large suoplies with which the markets continue to be supplied by the growers,notwithrstandilng the activeip-rosecutions of field operations. Barley of a goodmalting quality ismow getting into a small compass; choice qualities commandmore mnoney. Grinding barley te s slggish, The demand for seed oata and beanis being now pretty well satisfied, both these sorts of grain show a marked tendency to decline,
At to-day's market there wee a large suPply of wheat, In good condition, but the demand ruled slow, and millers and factors were enablee' to supply themselves at a reduction of ill, to Is. Per load (Is. 4d. to 2s. &d. per qr.) Best malting sorts of barley commanded Isetweek's rates; inferior kinds rather lower. On-to were in brisk demand, but not advanced in price.

The transactions in wheat at the locra markets have generally raled steady, but in one or twvo instances wheat and flour have experienced a slightly increased retail demand. This was the casoe at Maidstone market on the 12th, where the limited quantity of sampleron offer wore taken up at last week's rates, white wheat maldng its, to 65s, and some good parcels of red 5s to6 i60s. The trade In both kinds of barley was active, and prices a turn dearer. At Faversbam on WedneElaytshe market was but scanttlysupplied with wheat, the prices, however, for which were furm. Fine malting parcels of barley were 13 dearer. At Sandwich, on the same day, the best eamples of wheat were bought freely at a trifling advance, but other sorts met with scarcely an inquires.

There has been but a moderate demand for cloth, bat the sales recently made of fabrics suited to the India trado have given firmness to prices, and manufacturers are in some cases asking a trifling advance. Long cloths and printers are in about the same position as last week, the demand keeping prices steady. For yarns of most kinds spinners are asking fuil rates, but the demand is limited to moderate quantities, buyers manifestingthe same cautious policywhich has been pursued for some time past.
BIRBINGHAM, MACEcL 15.
Thero is less activity observable in the works of some iron establishments of South Staffordshire than a few weelcs ago, but the first makers offer no complaints, and prices are well supported. Good orders have recently been received from Germany, and, as regards the North American trade, prospects continue to improve. As the prelminary quarterly meeting of ironmnasters will be held in about ten days, it is improbable that any extensive contracts will be entered into before that period, but, from all that can be ascertained, there is no probability of any reduction of prices being declared at the approacning assemblage of the trade.
The continued high price of metals has created dulness in many branches of local manafacture; a.d the belief enter. tained by some that a reduction of copper is not far distant prevents purchases being made to any exten t beyond imme-

The general hardware manufactures of the town are flat rather than otherwise. The hop which were so confidently entertained a few months ago have not been realized to the extent expected, although n some branches there continues to be considerable activity. The lamp manufacture is, as customary at this season, dull, hut this year it is more than usually so; and the jewelry, with other lightbusinesses, partakes of the languor which now prevails. These remarks apply more particularly to the demands for the home trade but generally those for exportation axe moderately good.
In the neighbourhoods of Westbromwicb, Dudley, Brierly hill, and other manufacturing localities the foundries are fairly off for work, but in those neighbourhoods affected by recent failares considerable heaviness exists, aud still severer is anticipated. The contracts now in course of completion by the assignees of the estate of Messrs. Fox and Henderson, at the London works, Smethwick, are expected to be finished in about three weeks, when some scores of workmen, in addition to the immense number already discharged, will be thrown out of employ.
The glass trade of Binningham and the district is depressed, although it is stated that it has evinced symptoms of revval daring the present year. During the present week the Birmingham Plate and Crown Glass Company has held its annual meeting, when the directors reported that the business of the last 12 months had beeus -orofitless and that there was consequently nothing to diviae among the shareholders. This dwgreeable resalt is attributed to the competition of rival companies in Lancashire, and the consequent reduction, it is presumed, both of business and

Not quite so many lace buyers have appeared here this week for the home matket, but numerous orders have been received-several very large ones for India. A fewCanadians, who have stayed later than usual, have been operating again. Many home buyers are expected here next week to make selections for April, in which month more business is usually done than in any other of the year. Several German buyers are still in the market, and numerous orders for Germany are in the course of execution. The fancy branches of the lace business are rather more quiet, but prices of all goods are firm.
In framework-knitted fabrics there is a fair but quiet business. The unfavourable state of the weather and the approaching general election operate against the home spring trade, and the high price of goods prevents a lar

For commercial purnoses, though the market is tight, money is obtainable upon good bils and satisfactory sectuities at 6 per cent., but upon real property mortgages cannot be had at 5 per cent. MIany good properties in the couzse of erection, and which are required for the accommodation of this rapidly increasing population, are likely to stand stil forvant of money. This is a novel andmarkedfeature of the present time, and the effect is likely to be a drawback to the growth of the town, which has wonderfully augmented duringthelastfiveyears; and thiswant exists,notwithstandine all the local manufactures are in a flourishing condition, and additional residences for the people were never more wanted than now. This is evidenced by the high rates at which medium and smaller houses are letting, and the readiness 'with which rents are collected.
LEICESTEE, MARcHs 14.
There is a light improvement in the hosiery trade, the cotton branch being decededly active. In worsted goods there is not much doing, although orders are stiU being given out. Manufacturers have little stock on hand, nor do they feel inclined to make any, the greatest caution having been manifested for some time past. There is a slight business doing for export. Worsted yarns are fully as dear as last week.
LEEDS, MAacH 14.
A quiet tone has prevailed in the woollen-cloth trade. There has only been a smaU number of buyers in town, and in the warehouses business is far from being brisk. The only goods for which there is any considerable demand are light fabrics, which continue to be inquired for. There is much caution exercised in giving orders, and, as the manufacturers are not worldng up goods on speculation, stocks remain in a small compass. In wool there seems to be a likelihood of a little reaction, and probably prices will soon arrive at some definite standard. When this takes place, and the turmoil occasioned by the general election has subsided, the cloth trade will no donbt receive a fresh impnlse.
Inthe retail trade alsothere is not at presentmuch aetivity, aS the demand for winter cloths no longer exists, and that
for spring and summer goods has not fully commenced.

The trade of this town continues in a satisfactory state. worsted and yarns some improvesnent has been manifested; but m wool busine6sis rather duller and prices have a s1ight tendency to give way.
BRADFORD, aRCU 14.
The sales of combing wools have not been extensive, betng generally confined to the immediate requirements of the manufacturers, yet the p rices lately ruling for these descriptions are maintained. The same tone of quietness characternzes the demand for English long stapled wrools at the metropolitan sales, but adviees report pelcesto be rather easier. at this market, however, there does not anrr to be mnuch likcelihood of rates giviDg way for the finer deseriptions, although for low and middling qaalities the alight eon,
cession noted lsd week is contirued. Clothing wools meet aoo4 ddemand at extreme rates. Foreiga wools are s6me-
whtquiet.
There is more animation in the yarn trade, which his secently MaUfetet a gradual improvement from the low ebb to w'hich spinners had been driven by the high prics of combing wools, and it is now in a morehealthy condition. Orders are given out more freely, and contracts are acceDted to a lrger extent both for home uso and shipment at r.ther better prces. The stocks of worsted yarns on hand are limited, spinners beingprecluded from speculative production. Cotton yarns maintain their late value.
The aspect of the piece-trade is that of a tendenoy to quietness, with steady currencies. The excitement consequent on the active preparations for the forthcoming election doabtless has its temporary influence in this respect.

The Cultivation Of Cotton.
THE CULTIVATION OF COTTON.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMIES.
Sir,-I took oocasion some little time ago to represent to you that cotton could be grown in some parts of Australia, and that Government had been applied to on the subject: but without any satisfactory result. My idea was that convict labour could be brought to bearupon the cultivation of cotton in Moreton Bay, for example, where there is to be found the requisite moisture wshich is wanted in India. Since I addressed you on this subject; the followving remarks in the Sy~dney Herald of December 1, 1856, hare comue to hand, and I append them for the information of those vwho takes an intereEt in the matter:-
We have been favoured with a sampleo f cotton grown by tr. Jobn Panton, formerly a. member ot the Legiative Oouncii, and now iving at Ipowicb, in the district of Moreton Bay.
" Having shown, this samDle to several gentlemen whose experienwa and judgment In cotton as an artEio of commerce are undoubted, we are enabled to state with con-fdence that, for length of fibre, purity of colour, and softness of fabric, this sample could rarely be equalled in the great mart3 in Enaland, which receive the produce of tho cottongrowing countries of the world. In general character it seeems to asmmilate most eldoly with what iskIown as e3a Island cotton, but is in every reapect of far superior quality to that description, as usually sent into the market.
'MIr. Pauton says that the eample sent was a portion of tho produce of 77 pods, wbich produced in the seed 601 rods; that it growj moet luxariantly; but he further expDesCs an opinion that, to grow it on an extensive scale for exportation profitably It will require to import coolies from IndiA to asst in Its cultivation.
"This condition is certainly rather objectionable, but we are inclined to believe, from the information we have gathered, that it is not indispensable. If cotton plantations on an extensive scale were easblisbed on a soil and In a climate Eo congenial to the growth of the plant as that of Moreton Bay and the distriets further ninth appear to be, we believe that it would afforl a rich retuSn to tho employment of European laboUr.
'The sample in ourposseasion would certainlyrealize a bigher price in theBritishmarket than thebighest averago which rals there for the best quaiities; and it is evident that in aUy enterplese of this kind it must be superiority of quality that mrst 1a matnly aimed at. This superiority of cultivation which, commanding more skill and industry than is given to the growth of cotton under the labour of the interior races, would be amply met by the more remunerative rates which the article would realis.
"Seeingthe immense advantage which it would bo toeStablash a groving export trade in this article, not only as a source of wealth to these olonies, but to supplys alrgely-increasing demand in the Old World, it is to be regretted that some practicat encouragement to cotton production should notbe given by the Government, whether in the mode proposed by Wr. Holt or not we do not at present seek to determine.
" The samplo before us is, we think, superior to that sent to the Paris Ehinbition, which obtained the very highest commendations from all quarters.
" The sample is open for Inspection at the of leo of this iournal to any gentleman who may feel intrested in the subjecL."
Considering the importance of becoming independent of the American market for tho raw material upon which our commercial prosperity largely depends, I need scarcely say that the above communication is deserving the attention of the Legislature as well as our manufacturers, and apart from the conideration as to whether our convicts eould be made available in establishing cotton plantations or not. Inducements are always wanting for the formation of settlements. The owners of "stations' are now the aristocracy of Australia, and the founders of plantations may in time become wealthy and great too.
Your obedient servat.

But when he found that that line was to be handed over to a company which had no interest to facilitate, and every interest to prevent, the free passage of this company's traffic on that line, and many other objections which he named, he thought it would be their duty to go forward to the committee of the House of Commons and ask for the insertion of clauses to protect their interests. If the Bill should be amended as they wished, he should be one of the first to exhort the North British shareholders to afford to that company all the benefit which they would derive from the efficient working of that railway on favourable terms - and, if Parliament chiose, he saw no difficulty in the bortf British taltng a subscription iri the line to the extent of kig sbsritoninth ln

Theohalf-yearly meeting of this company was held on Priday in Gas;gow, Mr. W. Johnston in the chair.
The report, an abstract of which has appeared in The T^imes, was taken as read.
The CxAhW in moving the adoption of the repcort, congratulated the shareholders on the dividend the directors had recommended. During the half-year just brought to a close the earnings had exceeded those of the preceding halfyear by about 40,0001., and that large increase had been earned bynoincrease in workmng expenses; so that thewhole of the increased amount was divisible among the ordinary shareholders. That increase was to them as nearly as possible 23 per cent. of dividend, and that being added to the I per cent. paid last half-year made the 3. per cent. of dividend now about to be declared. One of the reasons for tho diminished working expenses during the last half-year was that, with the same amount of men and of plant, they had during the preceding half-year earned the increased amount. They could have earned as much during that half-year if the same frcilities had presented themselves, but the colliers' strike and others prevented them from so doing. By newr mineral depdts being about to be made at Greenock, at Port Glasgow, and at Paisley, and by the increased traffic expected from the Lesinahagow Railway, there could be ittle doubt of an increase of the rineral traffic, and it was hoped that their passenger and goods traffic would also increase. At all events, nothing should be wanting on the part of the Directors, not only to increase the revenue, but to diminish the working expenses. During last half-year upwards of 23,0001. had been addea to capital. The greater T;art of that amount had been expended in the Motherwoel deviaton line, stil in progress, but expected to be open at Mfidsummer, and in completing the Crofthead extension and the now workshops at St. Roilox, But thero was a sum of about 3,4001. paid for plAnt. Under the award of Mr. Ioulldsworth a few hundred pounds on a balance of accounts for the two last half-years mav require to be paid to the Edinburgh and Glasgow Company, but as that amount was not adjusted, no part of it had been debited to revenue, The company had now three Bils in Parliament,-ono for a branch to Granton, over which thoy expected to carry 100,000 tons of coal and mineral traffic annually. They would not only have dues for about 40 miles on the Caledonian Proper on all those minerals, but also dues on the Granton branch sufficient to make it pay. Ho then adverted to the proposed Carlisle and Hlawick line, to authorze which thero was a Bill before Parliament, and if sanctioned would enablo the Caledonian to fulfil all their former engagements for branch lines. He complained of the conduct of the Scottish Central Company in diverting the traffic from the Caledonian line, and stated that, unless Parliament sanctioned one of their Bils referring to that matter, they must have recourse to the courts of law, or some remedy must he obtained, as it would never do to submit to the proceedings of that company with respect to their traffic. lie concluded by moving that the report be adopted, and theo ditvidends therein recommended be declared payable
Mr. COLQUHOiN moved an amendment to the effect that the report be approved, and that the servants of the company be not required to perform any systematic work on the Lord's day.
Mr. X'MUlcrax, one of the directors, seconded tho amendment in reference to the Sabbath traffic.
A show of hands having been taken, the chairman declared that the amendment was negatived.
The forfeiture of ccrtain shares was then confirmed, and the directors were authorized to sell, cancel, or otherwise dispose of the same.
Mr. Young, the retiring auditor, was then re-elected, and the meetiDg separated.
EASTERN COUNTIES.
The dispute with reference to the Victoria (Norwich) station on this lin is about to be carried into the law courts. Certain inhabitants of Norwich contend that under theEastern Counties, Eastern Union, and Norfolk Railways Arrangement Act, 1854, the Eastern Counties Company were bound to work the Victoria station, and that they had not qomplied with that provision.
CRYSTAL PALACE DISTRICT GAS COMPANY.
The report of the directors of this company adverts to the steady and continued improvement of the business, as shown by the aunual gas rental during two years and a-half the company have b^en at work. The gas rental for the half3ear endinK 1854 amounted to 1,736r for the year 1855 to 5,07S7., anfor the yearl856to 6,5361, Thecompanyestimate that they are at present in possesson of a gas rental of nearly S,000.. per annam. The directors mention that a decrease has taken p lace in the value of coke, but they have laid in coals at asower rate, have obtained a higher price for tar, and are carrying on successfullv the conversion of aminoniacal liquor into solid sulphate of ammonia. The arrears on calls amount to 7,4461. The rrofits on the year amount to 2,297C., out of which a dividond of 5 oper cent. per annum was declared on the paid-up capital of the company, setting aside 4151. for depreciation of plant, mains,
sc tleaving a balance of 1071. for the next account. The capital account showecd that 39,003L. had been received, inelulding 7,9050. on loans, and 37,1741, excpended, leaning a

The Guards For Canton.
THE GVARDS FOR CANTON.
TO THE EDITO . OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Your correspondent, "Nulla Dies Sine LineS.," recommends that the Guards should be despatched to China.
Now, it so happens that in the present emergency this excellent suggestion might be immediately carried into effect, without at all unhinging tho routino of Palace dcty at St. James's or Windsor.
A comparison of the Army Estimates for 1853-54 (year of peace) with the Army Estimates far 1857-58, shows that the Household Brigado is at this moment stronger than it was in the former year by 36 oflicers, 54 non-commissioned officers, and 960 rank and filo-total of all ranks, 1,050eql to a good battalion of the line.
The practical lesson taught by these figares is that two battalions of veteran Guardsmen mivht conveniently be spared from Aldershott for the protection of Brtishli nd property in the "Flowery LAnd."

Theman profsof ora,pprobation of my conduct, as Your Repreenttiveou he ocasons ofmy annually rendering an account of my esewrdehp Iduceme,for the third time, to tender my servioea to repreentyouIn he omig rarliament ; confidently trusting that the recrS f yur ote inmy favour at the approachine election, willl affrd e he raifyngproof of your undiminished confidence.
Shoula you conf er upon ace the honour of representing you in. the next Per lament, my untiring efforts shall be directed to Protect Your pockete, by reducing the prodigal expendriture of the taxes leTied upon You. This expenditure Is mainitsale for corrupt purpo. a,nd not for the efficient roquirements of the public service. The estimeate which the new Parliment will be cAlled upon to vole for the niext yea wJil be upwards of £6,OCD.0c0 (six milionsl mnore than the Year before the commencement of the Russian war, after deducting every prevision consequent un that waLr, without Including the cost of the war with Persia anid aI. I WIll use eTery effort to reduce this proposedre uigute expenditure of the people's money, amontingto about as m=e a
the troduce of tbeinoume-tax of svenepeuoe in tOie pound; andtorender mnore equitable the existing systtemt of taxation which protects the rich cla'sa from contribuiting its due Proportion, and throws the heaviest burden on the industrious and productive clasares, by ineqtually taxIng she neecesaries of life. I have, by vot-s and speeches, contributed to remove this Injustice, and I will continue sotodo wheni, byyous favour, I shall be re-elected as yourrepresenintive in the Commons' House.
I will do all in my power to remove the inJUstce Ot ImPosing the ram.e amount af Incomenc tax on tradesmen and professional men as on lend and other real property; aud I would totally abolish this tax oni all itcomes under £150 a sear.
I have ever been an ardent supporter of civil and relilgous liberty, I have Oppo3ed all grants of public money for EcclesiastIcal purposea, I have rupporte every propo3itlonfor the abolition of chulrch rates.
To sEcure economy in the expenditure of the public money, the enactment of just laws and good Government, I deem it to be indlspen. table that the House of Commons should he so constituted as to he a full, fair, and free representation of the people. In my opinion this c-an onlybe efl'ected by a large extension of the elective franchise, with the protection of the ballot forIts indepenident exercise by Parliaments elected for a period not exceeding three lears and by the formation of mnore equasl electorat districto.. have given, and I shall Idtm to these important reformse my cordial suppot
Wyhilst I have ever supported toe rights of the meple and the best
interests of our country I have rever given a factions vote againat the Governiment of Lord 'almernton, nuor against any other lmnister. Upon all occasions I have acted according to my honest conscientiouz co-sictloss, and these convictions alone influenced mein giving mayrecent vote on the China question.
If you think me again worthy of being entrusted with your Interests in Parliament, and wil rep'aco me in the distinguished Position I now hold as your R.eproentatlve, I shall pursue the same undeviating course whbich has for so many years guided mylpublio conduct, and, as heretof ore, at the terminationofteach session, Iwill submitt my Parlsmneutary conduct to your cossideration, and resign my weat If reqLuired by a majority of my constituents.
I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, your faithful servant,
Park-square, Mao:h 14, 1557. WILLI&M WILLIAMS.
To the ELECrORS of the BOROUGHEof L&MBETZ, Gentleraen,
SUMMONED) by numerous and repeated calls to
become a candidate for the representation of Your boorough, I should have considered it a mark of disrespect to such a constituency were I t-) refuse at ones to place myself at your service.
Coninected with you by the cloeest ties, both by Proprt and descent. I clsion to repsesent your feelings, sympatides, and interets mua degree with wbichr few others can compete.
Althouigh yoeng in years, I have received a poiltical and social training which has rendered me a memiber of the meest advanced section of the great Liberal party.
I amn necosarily a, strong and un,flinching advocate ot thae aret principles of extensive Parliamentary reform, for the removal of these blemishes which yet disfigure our electoral systemn, and the steady and regular develepmnent of that political liberty for which we have as yt
onlyv prepared the way, foremost among which I place vote by balt
endsa large extension of the franchise.
I think that the fearful errors which have been committed in all dePartments of our Admniniotratlos, the shipwreck of the oldest regulwtioiie, demonstrate in. the clearest manner, the urgent neecessity for a well-considered but sweeping measure of Admininstrative reform carried into every section of our Government departments, but unore especially those which have chown themselves hopelessly tainted with the sin of lavish extravagance, glaring incapacity, and the grossest nepotusm.
I need hardly say that I should not venture to solicit your suifrages were I not in the fullest sense an advocate for the freest and mnost unofettered development of the great principles of Tre Trade, which hLave received so brillant a confirmation, and which have principally contrituted in maaintaint our comxsoerclalpoetlon as first among the natiosx of the earth.
I have devoted a large Bbare of time and attention to the study of the great questions of our social organization and especially the regulation of the principles which ought to determine the relations Of capital and labour, and trust that, as a large employer, I haves at least approximated to a satisfactory solution. My connexion with the working casses has deeply impressed upon my mind the necessity for the most liberal and comprehemnSive view of the education question, and I ma beperittd t pont ithprie a myown porzonal efforts to ciry ot pactsaly te rinipln Iproess Ihave not, however, con. lind m atenton nlyto he isig gnertio, but have consecrated
I conceive tbaat I should be falling In my duty to the interests of the c-ommercial and trading classes, whose support I seek, were I not to avow muy sincere regret at the uncertain and conflicting slats of the laws which regulate our bankingsytm y belief In the urgent neceesity for stringent legislation on thispoint, and for the hearty cooperation of all members of the community in elevatingr the present conSdittoii 0t our commercial morality.
No man would J feel sure, dare to appeal to the electerm of Lamobeth who had not nailed to the mast the standard of religious liberty; I1 am therefore opposed on principle to every forM Of grant of publie meney for religious pu-rposes, and should earnestly advocate an immediate adjustmentof the church-rate question, that perennial source of bitter. ness anid contention.
On the vexed questions of our foreign retlatons, I most vehemently condemnn the anti-national policy of the unnatural coalition whichL has recently disgraed our Legislature-a policy Identical with that which deceived the Russians Iuto a belief of our weakness, and led to the disastrous contest from which It coat us so heavy an expenditur of blood anid treasure honoerabl to emerge. I shall unquestionably support any Minister who wl maintainx the honour and independleuce of our flag, who shall protect the weak against the strongLiberal Governiment aainst despotic tyranny who, shall repres King Bomabs-rosaa leBson to King siuquot, and aLfford that encouragement to our valued and faithful allies in Sardinia and Turkey whicht they have proved themselves so well to deesev: at the same time I never will consent to enter the people's Howe as a blind and menonin suporer o Lod Pamestenor any other Minister, hutshal mintin hatindpenenc ofspiitand character without I shll e hapy o afoodpubiclyto achand all of you the fullest explnaton f myvies o an poits n wichyou may require it,

The phrase, "an appeal to the country," embodies,
The phrase, "an appeal to the country," embodies, we conceive, a principle which will be found unchanged at every period of our political history. A dissolution of Parliament is not merely an appeal from a small to a large body of men, but from a class to the nation-from a special to a general public, from sophisticated to natural opinion. Even supposing Members of Parliament to be thoroughly honest and sincere, uninfluenced by party spirit, untempted by the hope of office, and judging every question on their view of its merits, still we hold that the fact of their belonging to a particular assembly, with all its unavoidable traditions and feelings,of their hearing matters discussed year after year by the same half-dozen leading speakers,-of their own gradual organization into knots or cliques, -of their unconscious inoculation with the spirit of professional politicians, has a tendency to warp their judgment as a body on questions of large scope, and mislead them as to the deepest currents of national feeling. We all know how strong a naturo is requisite to free a man from the influence of circumstances and his mode of life. It is said that there is scarcely a trade which does not give its own distortion to the body and its own cast to the countenance. Skilful detectives, we are assured, can tell the carpenter from the bricklayer, the tailor from tae shoemaker-nay, can even distinguish between the professors of the various branches of felony, by certain indubitable indications of face, gait, and manner. Mentally there are sinilar divergences among different orders of men. It is not difficult to judge beforehand how Chancerybarristers, how clergymen, how officers in the army will think on a given subject, and one may be sure that the same ideas will be expressed in almost the same language by numbers of the same class without the sightest intercommunication. Why should the House of Commons be free from a similar influence7 Nightly meetings during four or five Sessions are quite enough for the master spirits of the House to impress their character on the plastie minds of the mas of Vwteners, who become, not only
in a partisan sense but also, as It were, intelectuaUy, Palmerstonians, or Gladstonians, or Cobdenites. Furthermore, they acquire what we may call a House of Commons' mind, and from the habit of conducting business iu detail, moving verbal amendments, striking out clauses, inserting clauses, speaking against time, and the rest of it, they lose a great deal of the broad and general spirit in which the public judges of national questions. A Parliament four years old has often lost & good deal of its rappor- with the public mind. It is no smalI benefit when its members are sent back to their constituents, and are obliged once more to heat the observations of shrewd common sense, and to express themselves in terms of homely oratory.
Take this affir of the Chinese dispute. A majority of the House of Cormmons, composed of men of widely different political opinions, and including most of the effective orators, vote, after four nights' debate, for a resolution condemnatory of the Government. Now this majority, it ig true, was made up partly of humanitarians and seekers for office-of the sincere and those who turn their sincerity to account. But it is evident that all these sections, the followers of Air. CoBDElT, the followers of Mtr. GLADSTONE and Mr. DirsAEmI, aU thought they were doing what would be immensely popular. Tihey firmly expected that the country would be with them in their denunciations of the Canton bombardment and their technical triumph about the expired register. If Mlr. DIsRAALI, for instance, had not
considered the question a suitable one for the gre?t pitched battle of the Session, he would certainly have waited and fought about tea, or Persia, or Naples. But he and his allies had read the blue-book, and thought their triumph certain. What is the result? They have scarcely gained the victory when they find they are lost men. The coun-. try rises with a cry of indignation. The unanimity is so complete that for the present an antiMinisterial party does pot exist. It is scarcely possible to find any one who does not condemn in the strongest terms the conduct of the Coalition. Not only the merchants and tradesmen of the towns, but the classes which are the main props of the Conservative party-squires, clergymen, farmers,-aU join in declaiming against the late vote as a factious and disreputable proceeding. It is plain, then, that the House of Commons, the Tory leaders, the seceding Liberals, knew nothing of the temper of the country.
Here are the Conservatives, an astounded and. ruined faction; here are the independent Liberals, forced to go to their constituencies with apologies and expressions of penitence, because they had no conception that in attacking the Minister who had restored the country to its place in Europe they had touched the ark of England's national feeling.
Now, putting aside the party leaders, who wish to get into place, and their followers, who vote with them as a matter of course, let us take the honest and sincere voters with the majority, and try to find a reason for the course they took, with such unsuspecting ignorance of its consequences. We will suppose a sensible, indepcndent Liberal, a good man of business, a little bitten with the peace mania, and with a strong appetite for reports, correspondence, tabular appendices, and the whole literature of Parliamert. He has attended divisions without nuniber on aU sorts of subjects, whether he understood them or not; he has moved amendments and refused to withdraw them vith aggravating pertinacity. He prides himself on being practical, on looking at the subject before him and nothing else, and thinks that any question, social, political, or moral, affecting the national destinies can be solved by leaving out al the words after " that" in somebody else's motion and inserting certain other words of his own. Such a man went to the study of the Canton blue-book, as more than one has owned, Ma if it were a brief. The invalidity of Hongkong law when opposed to Imperial law was a great point. The expiration of the Arrow's license was another. By his natural character and his Parliamentary habits the Member is led into speaking and voting solely with regard to the narrow issues which he and the gentleman on his right, or the gentleman behind him, have extracted from certain official correspondence. He has not the slightest notion that he is doing anything unpopular, for he would not be unpopular for the world. But a course of blue-book reading, of listening to five-hour speeches, of eternal disquisitions on matters of detail, in which each speaker speaks for victory, and narrows the question becauise to widen it might obliterate the differences which he wishes to maintain, have made our independent Member no just representative of his countrymen. He has become a laborious, punctual, excelently misinformed trifler, his mind has lost its tone, and the best thing for him is to be sent once more to breathe the bracing air of an electioneering contest, and to plunge into the cold bath of an adverse popular demonstration.
This is what the Liberals, whlo voted with the majority, wiU have to do, and we trust it will restore them to sound political health. Let them take an example from the country. The public never read the blue-book, but they heard sufficient about the facts, and made up their minds in accordance with common sense and, we think, sound law. They refuse to allow YEH to insult us with impunity because of some alleged invalidity in colonial registers, an invalidity which it is preposterous to believe that YEi knew anything about. They see plainly that the expiration of the register is a matter between the master of the Arrow and ourselves, and that if we choose to waive the necessity of renewing it on the very day it expires, that is a matter with which the Chinese have nothing to do. But these are details, and the country, though not inattentive to them, has subordinated them to the general question. It never loses for a moment its instincts as a governing and conquering people, who, with a multitude of small communities scattered over the earth, in the face of vast hostile or dangerous population, can never afford to punish zeal and public spirit in its agents as a crime. The nation feels that we have
too long allowed ourselves to be repelled and insulted by a race of treacherous barbarians, and that it is high time to assert the position which belongs to us as the representatives of enlighten. ment and civilization. Happily England has had during several generations men Who have dared to serve her undeterred by the outpourings of false humanity or faction at home. If, instead of them, such men as are now inveighing against our conduct in China had administered our policy, we should now have been inhabiting the England of the TuDoRs instead of the England of Queen YVICTORm.
In the political heavens one sun begins to rise
In the political heavens one gun begins to riso before the other has set, and at this moment a spectator may contemplate the glimmerings of a sinking Parliament on one side of the horizon and descry on the other the earliest beams of its auccessor in the addresses of candidates and aspirits. Alreadyhave collumns after columns of these produetions appeared in our pages, fraught With ample matter for speculation and deduction. To say that we can distinguish any features of novelty in the rising lights would be saying rather too much, for the moot notable characteristic at present is tie absence of character, or, in other words, the lack of any tUic decided conflict either of prijnQi q&purpos
aiE would explain the dissolution announced. With the exception of Lord Joux R]uSsLL, to whose -address we have before adverted, and Mr. J. H. Z4AxwVEL, vwhose opposition to the Paxrizx in his -own field of battle necessarily pushes him to a -osition of distinct antagonism, few of the candi,dates care to proclaim any positive issue, or to challenge any downright selection. One announce3;nent, however, there is indeed possessiDg decision, 'comprehensiveness, and individuality sufficient to atone for all the smoothness and dulness of ordinary politics, and to communicate to these eomn:znonplace times of ours at least one spark of mystery :and grandeur. A gentleman addresses not merely -the electors of this metropolis, but those of Great 'Britain and Ireland, to the effect that a crisis has -rived not only in British, but in universal lhistory; that the first or undeveloped period of -man's existence is now, in the order of nature, -about to terminate for ever, and that a new existence for the human race is impending. The system of this new age he offers to explain, and to iutroduce with the greatest advantage and the least disturbance, in the place which, of all others, is at this period best fitted for the discovery,-the British House of Commons. 'rhe reader may smile at this Oriental-looking ~figure of a prophet among politicians, b;-t when we add that the name of the aspirant is ROBEBT -OwrX, and that he proclaims himself, though in the 87th year of his age, still preserved in strength of mind and body for the accomplishment of his -work, it will not be denied that there is somethinglipressive about a mission so earnestly con-ceived and so unflinchingly maintained.
From viewz of such loftiness to those of actual politics the descent is considerable, and we are at a loss, indeed, to find any point of salience enough to break the fall. The topic naturally claiming the first attention of the inquirer vould be that on which the late rupture occured-the Chinese var ; but here the sentiments expressed are by no means very prominent. One circumstance, however, deserves remark, and that is, that wherever any decision of language or opinion is exhibited it is generally on the side of the Government, while those who opposed it in the division now qualify their opposition by reservations of -mnore or less force, till in some cases the difference almost disappears. Mr. W. RourIJLL, introducing hIimself to the electors of Lambeth, stigmatizes the " anti-national policy of the " unnatural Coalition ;" and, though prolaiming himself an independent man, gives his preference to the politics of Lord PALssmSTOX'S Vinistry. MIr. BEAcHr, addressing the electors of North Hants, while announced as a Conservative, an uncompromising Protestant, and a cordial supporter of the agricultural interest, is ready to " support any Government in mainctaining the honour of the British flag, and, if in
Parliament, would have opposed the late discreditable coalition of parties to displace the present " Government." The Chinese question produced ayes, noes, and neutrals, but among them all we find leanings towards Lord PALMERsTroN and his policy. Sir DE LAcY EvA-s took refuge from his doubts in neutrality, but he affirms now the inevitable necessity of setting two points at rest,-the security of our countrymen in the East and the ascendancy of our arms. Mr. MILNs GASIELL abstained also from Voting, having disapproved M1r. Co]nu's resolutions as well as Sir JomN BowRiuo's conduct; but, -though a Conservative, he is " in the present con4" fused and disjointed state of political parties "4 prepared to extend to Lord PALUERSTOrN'S 4' Administration a larger measure of for" bearance than that which it has lately i' experienced in the House of Commons." Among those who voted against Ministers Lord ROBunrT GROSVENOR tells the electors of 3\iddlesex that " he quite concurs with those who " think that Lord PAzrIERsTous's Government de" serves a generous support at the hands of the "country," and that it " would have much c increased the pain he felt in placing himself " on the late occasion in opposition," if he had 7believed that an adverse decision on the resolutions proposed Nwould have brought about the retirement of Ministers from office. Mr. BRA-MSTON, in addressing the electors of South Essex, goes a step further, and avows, Conservative as he is, that, -though he voted with Mr. COBDEN, " had a motion 4'been made, as under similar circumstances had " frequently been the case, of a want of confidence inl "Lord PALMERSTON's Administration, he should "without hesitation have opposed it." Mr. G. S. Buox, speaking to North Devon; Mr. FrARxR, to South Durham; and Mr. B&ss, to Derby, take no notice of China at all. Mr. MAsTElrs SSITrrn informs the electors of West Kent that he " has " not offered, and is not prepared to offer, any c factious opposition to Lord PAUTERsToN's " Government."
Of the other topics thrown up to the surface in this incipient agitation of the constitutional waters -we find not much to eopect. Free Trade, of course, is now beyond canvass.. Extension of the Fran-chise crops out here and there, and the Maynooth qu'estion asserts its universal presence. The Income-tax is naturally a subject of remark, and National Education comes in for a slhare of notice, but on none of these points is there likely to be a decided issue taken. In one or two instances we observe a marked attention given to matters bearing upon social interests, but these again would be considered independently of party. It is too early as yet to form any very definite conclusions, nor are the data before us sufficiently n.unerous to admit of broad generalization, but, as far as we can infer from anything that has already transpired, we should certainly be disposed to doubt -whether the new Parliament will exhibit such a simplicity of constitution or such a clear demarcation of parties as seemed once to be anticipated. We see one class -of opinions very plainly, but not another. We see approbation of Lord PRUIRSTOrN, more or less qualified, but no approbation of Lord Anybodyelse; nor can we even discern what principles -or politics are to be opposed to those distinguished by Liberalism and progress. Of course, we are not Presuming that a Liberal Government wliU escape an Opposition-it is not
to be wished that it should do so, for the machinery of our constitution requires the con-
trary. WV e fail, however, to discover the prin-ciples of this Opposition boldly put forward. It is said, and with apparent reason, that there must always in the nature of things subsist under some name or other those two great parties which were called Whigs andTories in days gone by. This may be so, but, whereas we have no difficulty in finding the former, we hardly know where to look for the latter. There are two sides of the House, but not tvo sides of polE-ties in the old, broad, comprehensive form. Contests now-a-days appear, in short, less for priniciple than for place; and, perhaps, as there must be two parties, whereas there can hardly be more than one true line of progress, this is about as good a result as w e could obtain. But from such a deduction theP6 follows certainly one very plain consequence, and that is, that if other things are thus evenly balanced the scale is certain to turn in favour of that Administration which, while it is at least equal in Liberalism to any other, has the credit of a successful war and an honourable peace.
A report now before us presents the first results
A report now before us presents the flint results of a most important resolution adopted by Lortd PANuus this time last year. The readers of thU
iudal will not require to be informed of the solic tude with which every bianch of military eduecI { n has recently been regarded, and of the interest which now attaches to any propositions for improving the general organization of the arny. Scarcely a month has passed of late without the appearance of some new regulation designed to increase the efficitncy of this or that department, but a far wider and more coniprehensive scope is assumed by the publication to which we- are now alluding. Most persons, especially after our recent experience, will possess such a discriminative acquaintance with military affairs as to understand the elementaly divisions of an army into infantry, cavalry, and so forth, nor will they find much diffliculty in appreciating a more general distinction to which they will be here initroduced. All modern armies, in fact, may be divided into two departments, one comprising the battalions and squadrons charged with the work of manual combat, the other formed of those bodies which undertake special services and require special training. Omitting for the present the Medical, Commissariat, and Transport Corps, we refer, above all, to the Artillery, the Engineers, and the Staff. The two former of these bodies are termed in our own service " the Scientifac Corps," and provision has always been made for their efficiency by separate administration. On the assumption, however, that occasion was offered for improvement, Lord PANuuRE in January last appointed a commission to consider the best mode of reorganizing the system for training officers for the corps in question, and, after instructing the Commissioners to proceed to foreign countries in search of evidence and guidance, authorized them to record in their report all such observations and facts as might appear to them of importance with reference to " military education" generally. To the labours and conclusions of this Commission we now owe an extremely interesting volume. The gertlemen appointed to the service-LieutenantColonel YOAND, of the Engineers ; LieutenantColonel S31YTHE, of the Artillery; and the Rev. W. C. LAKE, of Balliol College, Oxford-visited the Military Academies of France, Prussia, Austria, and Sardinia, and gave such ample effect to their instructions that they have presented the country not only -with their suggestions as to the training of " the Scientific Corps," but with some most valuable observations upon military education in general, founded upon 'die results to which they have been led by the inspection, consideration, and comparison of the celebrated schools of Europe. In introducing our readers to their proceedings we will follow their method of taking the general subject first, and the paiticular subject afterwards. The visits of the Commissioners were, of course, not extended to Russia, but the other Governments opened every source of information to them with exemplary courtesy and promptitude.
In every country but our own the great objects of military education are promoted by a liberal support and elaborate supervision on the part of the State. For such purposes the Government of Austria provides an annual sum of between 300,0001. and 400,0001.; and that of Prussia, notwithstanding its traditional economy and the comparative smallness of its standing army, as much as 40,0001. The disbursements of France upon the education of officers alone amount to 48,0001., the appropriations for similar objects being 27,0001. in Prussia and 127,0001. in Austria. In England " the annual sum we have ex" pended till the last few years on the education " of all the officers of our army has been about
1,3001.-not one-twentieth part of the expendi"ture o' Prussia, one-thirty-seventh of that of "rFrance, and about the hundredth part of that of
Austria." In point of fact, we have schools for the Artillery and Engineers,-the very institutions Lord PAmmvni; desired to reorganize,-none, as far as State -provision is concerned, for the Cavalry or the Line, and, what is a far more deplorable deficiency, none for the Staff. In the French army things are so ordered that one-third of all the officers in the Line, two-thirds of those in " the Scientific Corps' (thle remainder are appointed from the ranks), and all the officers on the Staff receive a careful professional education, the whole system on -which advancement depends be;7qg thoroughly competitive. In Prussia competition is not made so exclusively the mainspring of the machine, but security is taken for "a good
average of education, both general and pro"fessional, not fiom a proportion of select
officers, but universally, from all officers of "the service." In Austria the proportion of officers professionally educated is smaller than in France, and the system, as in Prassia, is more aristocratic ; but this is balanced by other arrange. ments, and especially by a carefil extension of education to non-commissioned officers. In Sardinia aU who enter the army as officers-i.e., aU whlo are not promoted from the ranks-pass through a military academy. In England, apart from the trainingprovided for "the ScientificCorps" at Woolwich, we rely upon the ordinary schools of the country for military as weeU as civil instruction, with the test only, as recently established, of examination uDon admission to the arny. There is, indeed, a Military Academy at Sandhiurst, but itis self-supporting, the large fees exacted from rich civilians being enough to counterbalance any excess of outlay in other directions, -while entrance is obtainable on nomination only. As to its Senior pepartment providing any training for the Staff, the institution " does not seem," say the commissioners, " at " least recently, to have been regarded as a Staff
School, in the sense in which schools bearing the "same name in France, Prussia, Austria, and " Sardinia educate for the Staff Corps, since in " those countries it is necessary that aU officers "on the general Staff should have frequented " for some years the Staff School, while it " appears that out of 216 officers who have re" ceived certificates at the Senior Department of "Sandhurst since 1836 only 15 were employed on "the Staff in May, 1854." This fact becomes the more emphatic when 'we learn that in every country visited by the commissioners, whatever might be the divergences in other respects, the entrance to the general Staff of the army was through the Staff School, and the entrance to the Staff School determined by competition. Moreover, whereas the Austrian Staff School attracted
the particular admiration of the commissioners, they were informed that some of the most distinguished Sardiniau officers, after their experience in the Crimea and elsewhere, pronounced the Austrian general Staff " the best in existence."
Our readers wil now be sufficiently acquainted with the foundations and objects of the report before us to appreciate the recommendations with which its several sections conclude. The views thus embodied we wiU now briefly explain, reserving for a future occasion the more particular consideration which they deserve, as well as the suggestions offered on that more special question which was the direct object of the commission. In general terms, the conclusions of the commissioners respecting the promotion of military education may be described as pointinZg towards greater encoouagement and more systematic superintendence. They think that the required training could not be given in the ordinary schools of the country, but that military colleges are indispensable, though the existing institutions m;ight suffice for the purpose, if prope0y extended, directed, and endowed. Admi3io1; to these acadedmies they would decide, in ti firt place, partially by competitia,
axd Irovide incentives to study and excellence in the shape of endowmentsfor the best proficients on eajt snce, and an increase of pay, lasting for five vears, to the most distinguished students on leaving, the former prizes not being confined exclusih ely t, pupils of the academy, but opened to those of any other seminaries. They are not, however, of opinion that all candidates for commissious should necessarily have passed through theMilitaryAcademy, but would relyupon a general examination for testing the merits of applicants not so qualified. These suggestions, the reader will ol)serve, tend simply to secure a due amount of ability hi those -who receive commissions. For the higher Iut poses of a good Staff, it is recommended that provision should be made enabling officers already iu tihe army to devote their efforts for a certain period to professional study. A good Staff College, Says the report, " if attendance at it be
inad . a - (dnon for a Staff appointment, "anid still more if Staff appointments are given in " accordance with the distinctions of its pupils, "will almost necessarily be frequented by most of "the young officers of talent and energy in "tlle army." Finally, as the most important and most comprehensive of their suggestions"far more inmportant than any other single object
we can r"conmnend," the commissioners advise the formnation of a board or section of military education, constituting a portion of the War Department, and under the control of its chief, charged 'with the general regulation and superintendence of all nilitary and reginiental schools, academies, and colleges-a measure which they conceive would secure niot only actual efficiency, bnt facilities for accomplishing all requisite improvements from time to time. Such, up to this point, is the purport of the documvint under review; the firther bearings of its various proposals we shall have another opportunity of examiining.
Death Of Earl Amherst.
DJRATM OF BARL AMHERST.
We have to record the death of Earl Amherst, who expired at 9 o'clock on Friday night, at Knowle-park, near Sevenoaks, Kent.
The venerable Peer had been in an indifferent state ol health for some weeks past, arising from a thorough decay consequent on old age, so that to the immediate members oE his family the mournful event was not unlooked for. Viscount and Viscountess [olrnesdale and Sir John and Lady Sarah Hay Williams were with the noble earl at hi3 dissolution.
William Pitt Amherst, Earl Amherst, of Aracan, in the East Indies, Viscount Holmesdale, county of Kent, Baron Amherst, of Montreal, County of Kent in the peerage of the United Kingdom, was eldest son of Lieutenant-General William Awher,st brother of Jeffrey, first Lord Amherst, by Ehzabeth, daughter of MIr. Thomas Patterson. He was born on the 14th of January, 1773, and succeeded to the barony, on the death of his uncle Jeffrey before named, in August, 1797. The late earl was twice married-first in 1809, to Sarah, daughter and co-heir of Andrew, second and last Lord Archer, and widow of the fifth Earl of Plymouth, who died in May, 1838, by whom his Lordship had surviving issue Lady Sarah, married to Sir John Hay Williams, Bart., and Viscount Holmeedale (now Earl Amherst); and secondly, on the 25th of June, 1839, Lady Mazy Saekville, eldest danghter and co-heir of John Frederick second Dulke of Dorset, widow of Other Archer, stxthEari of Plymouth, by wfhich lady, who survves him, ho leaves
The late Earl had been a Lord of the Bedchamber to Kings George 1II. and IV. and William IV. He was one of t e Canada Commissioners, and early in 1816 was appointed Ambassador Extraordinary to the Emperor of lhinab. He left England in the Alceste ia February of that year on his mission. On reaching the precincts of the mi. perial Palace at Pekin, and refusing to submit to the
huwiliating ceremonies of the Emperor's Court, he was rofused admission to the presence of the Emperor, and his mission was thus rendered useless. On his return in the Alceste, Captain Murray Mfaxwvell, he was wrecked oft the island Pnlo Leat, from which he proceeded, accompaized by the late Right Hon. Sir Henry EDis, in the boats of the wrecked ship, to Batavia, then recently conquered by the British under Lord Minto. He and his shipwvrecked companions there met with a safe asylum, and the remainder of the crew were rescued from the island on which the aBlp had been lost. In 1817, on his return to England, he nisited the Emperor Napoleon at the island of St. Helena, and was hononued with several iaterviews by that illustrious captive. He subsequently wuasl*pointed Governor-General of India and for his services there was in 1826 created Ea1 Amherst and Viseount Holmesdale. The deceased Peer was afterwards selected as Governor-General of Canada, but never proceeded on his mission. Since his second marriae, in 1839, his Lordship has led a. retised life, rarely irterfeering in poll. tics, chiefly directing his attention to the welfare of the poor on his estates in Kent.
The late Earl was made a Privy Counn:illor in 1815, and in 1834 nominated a GrandCross of the Order of tho Guelnhs of Hanover. By his death a pension of 3,000. a-year, which he enjoyed for his public services, ceases.
Tholate Pecr is succeeded in thefamily honours "d estates by his only son, William Pitt, Viqcount Holmesdale, born 3d of September, 1805, and married in July, 1834, to Gertrude, sixth daughter of the late Bishop (Perc) of Carlisle, by whom he has a fa:mily, his eldest S, WiUlliam Archer (now Viscount Holnesdale),a Captain in the Guards, having served at the battle of the Alma, where he wias dangerously

Yesterday morning, at a few minutes before 2 o'clock, a fire broke ont in the premises belonging to Mr. W. H. Child, wholesale brush manufacturer, Nos. 20 and 21 Providence-row, Worship-street, within a short distnce of Finsburys suare.
The building in which the fire commenced was of considerable extent, and was flanked on one side by several dwellinghouses and other places of business.
The Royal Society's escapes were soon in attendance, as well as several engines of the parish, London brigade, and West of England Insurance Company; the brigade being under the direction of Mr. Fogo, the foreman of the district, and the West of England under that of MIr. Connorton. For. tunately there was an abundant supply of water.
About two hours after the outbreak the whole of the factory, as well as the roof of the front building, used as workabops, sale rooms, &c., fell in with a fearful crash. Some hours elapsed before the conflagration could be subdued, and not until a serious amount of property was destroyed, both in that and adjoining buildings.
Another fire, attended with fatal consequencs to a man and his child, happened in the premises belonging to Mrs. Mary Ieary, and sublet to various poor families, situate No. 5.3 (lWer's-place, Mil-yard, Cable-street, Commercial-road, East. The bUlding was three or four floors in height, and extended some distance behind the front entrance. The discovery 7p,ears to have been made by one of the neighbours, by seeing an unusual glare of light in the room ocoxpied by Mrs. Leary. In an instant an alarm was given, when it was found that the flames bad taken possession not rcerely of Mrs. Leary's room, but were also rolling up the stairs with such fury as to cut off all means of retreat for several of the inmates. A.woman named Ann Jones
who lived in one of the upper floors, upon finding that she I was unable to descend through the flames on the stairs, threw a child she had care of out of window, and then jumped out herself. The child was not much hurt, but the poor woman was so severely injured that she bad to be removed to the London Hosuital.
The Royal Society's escap-o from the Whitochapel station started to the spot the moment it was called, when Wood, the conductor, found tho building from the first floor in a general blaze, which prevented him from rendering any assistance to a man and boy known to be within the house. As soon as the rains wrere sufficiently cooled the fireren by direction of Mr. Fogo, made a search for the man and his child, known to be missing, and in one of the ulpper rooms they found the remains of the father bursat almostto a cinder, but the child was not so much burnt and appears
to have been suffocated.!

Preaching And Preaching.
PBREACHNG AND PRBA CfING.
TO TE{E EDITOR OF THE1 TIMES.
Sir,-One Sunday morning about a month ago my wife said, " ILet us send the children to St. Margaret's to hear th Arhbishop of -- preach on behalf of the Society for Aged Ecclesiastical Cripples, wshich is to celebrate to-day its three hundredth anniversary." So the ehildren went, tvhough the parents, for reasons immaterial to mertion could not go with them. "Well, children how Aid you like the Archbishop of -, and what did he s3y about ' the Aged Ecclesiastieal Cripples?"' Here the children-for it was during their dinner-attacked their food with great voracity, but never a word could we get out of their mouths about the spiritual feast of which they had just partaken. No ! not even the text could they bring out. The more they were pressed the more they blushed and hung their heads over their plaWes, until at last, in a rage, I accused them of having faLlen asleep during the service. This charge threw my firstborn on his defence, and he sobbed out the truth, for by this time their eyes were full of tears. " Why, papa! we can't say what the Archbishop of - said, beeause we could not hear a word he said. He is very old, and has got no teeth; and, do you know, I don't think he has got any tongue either, for, though we saw his lips movirg, we could not hear a single word." On this I said no more, but I thought a good deal of " the Aged Ecclesiastical Cripples" and their venerable advocate, and being something of a philologist, I indulged in dreamy speculations on the possibility of an alphabet composed entirely of labiAl; and if my wife had not roused me from my dream by some mere matter-offact question I almost think I shou!d have given my reflections to the world in the shape of a small pamphlet entitled " The Language of Labials, or how to preach sermons r.-ithout the aid of either tongue or teeth: published for the benefit of the Societyof Aged Ecclesiastical Cripples, and dedicated, of course by permission, to the Archbishop
of -."
Now listen to auo:her story. A friend of inue, a Scotch Presbyterian, comes up to town and says, "I want to hear Spurgeon; let us go." Now, I am supposed to be a High Churchman, so I answered, "What, go and hear a Calvinist-a Baptist-a man who ought to be ashamed of himself for being so near the Church and yet not within its pale?" " Never mind, come and hear him." Well, we went yesterday morning to the Music-hall in the Surrey Gardens. At first I felt a strange sensation of wrong-doing. It was something like going to a morning theatrical performance on Sunday nor did a terrific gust of wind which sent tbe Arc.ic Regions, erected out of laths and pasteboard in a style regardless of expense, flying across the water of the lake, tend to cheer a mind depressed by the novelty of the scene. Fancy a congregation, consisting of 10,000 souls, streaming into the hall, mounting the galleries, humming, buzzing and swarming-a mighty hive of bee3-eager to recure at first the bes. places, and at last any place at all. After waiting more than half an hour-for, if you wish to have a seat, you must be there at least that space of time in advance-MIr. Spurgeon ascended the tribune. To the hum and rush and trampling of men succeeded a low concentrated tbrill and murmur of devotion, wbch seemed to ran at once like an electric current through the breast of every one present, and by this magnetic chain the preacher held us fast bound for about two
lours. It is not my purpose to give a summary of his discourse. It is enough to say of his voice that its power and volume are sufficient to reach every one in that vast assembly; of his language, that it is neither highflown nor homely; of his style, that it is at times familiar, at times declamatory, bu' always happy and often eloquent; of his doctrine, that neither the Calvinist nor the Baptist appear in the forefront of the battle which is waged by Mr. Spurgeon with relentless auimosity and with gospel weapons against irreligion, cant, hypocrisy, pride, and those secret bosom sins which so easily beset a man in daily life; and, to sum up alinm a wrord, it is enough to say of the man himself that he impresses you writh a perfect conviction of his sincerity.
But I have not written Eo much aboult mny children's want of xpiritual food when they listened to the mumbling of the Archbishop of-, and my own banq*et at the Surrey Gardens, without a desire to draw a practical conclusion from these two stories, and to point them by a moral. Here is a man not more Calvinistic than many an incumbent of the Established Church who " humbles and mumbles," as old Latimer says over his liturgy and text. IHere isa man who says the complete irumersion, or something of the kind, of adults is necessary to baptism. These are his faults of doctrine, but if I were the examining chapain of the Archbishop of -, 1 would aay,-" MIay it please your Grace, here is a man able to preach eloquently, able to fill the largest church in England with his voice, and, what is more to the purpose, with people. And may it please your Grace, here are two churrches in this maetropolis, St. Paul'rs and Wesminster Abbey. What does your Grace think of inviting Mr. Spurgeon, this heretical Calvinist and Baptist, who is able to draw 10,000 souls after him, just to try his voice,, some Sunday morning, in the nave of either of those churches? At any rate, I will answer for one thing, that if he preaches in Westmiister Abbey we shaU not have a iepetition oE the disgraceful practice now common. in that chuxch of having the sermon mefore the anthem, in order that those who would quit the church when the arid sermon begins may be forced to stay it out for the sake of the teusic which follows it."
But I sn not, I am sorry to sy, eIaniininlg chaplain to the Archbishop of- ; so I can only seii&you this letter from the devotional desert in which I re side, and sign myself

PB1rACESSS THVA TI.
That Kin!g Ridchrd I -is the most Magnificent and most elaborae of xll Mr. C. Kean's "rovivals" we have briefly
which Mr. Charlcs Kean deals out his historical erudition is EO thoroughly appreciated that when we say he has done rnore than he ever did before wo reach the limit of the Iondon oandard. A gentleman of uninterrupted health inquired of a valetudinarian friend (Joe fi&sr is the autbority) what was the difference between the rheumatism and the gout. " Put your finger in a vice, and screr it till you can bear it no longer-that's the rheumatism. Give it one screw moro-that's the gout.' So answered the man of painful experience. Substituting gratification for agony, we may say that Mr. Kean's Henry YIII. is his rheumatism, and Richard II. his gout. The intrinsic force of the opinion expressed on Friday morning respecting the triumph of Thursday night is not to be heightened. Nevertheless, as the mathematician expands a very modest-looking fraction into an infinite series, so may we expound eur brief enunciation into something like detailed description.
After a characteristic overture by Mr. Hatton the curtain rises, and discovers the Privy Council Cbamber in the Palace of Westminster. At once the audience is convinced that there wil be something unusual in the wholo exhibitionApart from those white harts and broom-pods with which walls and roof are sprin]kled there is an enclosure of antique form that separates the members of the Council from all outsiders. Bolingbroke, who comes to declare that Norfolk is " a traitor and a miscreant," and Norfolk, who retaliates against the appellant by terming him a " slanderous coward and a villain," stand without the bar, and are eyed by the lordly personages ensconced within its precincts as a roadsweeper in tho aisle of a parish church is eyed by the church. warden in his crimsoned pew. Here is something new, eometbing truthfuL Old playgoers have seen many mimic nobles brought before mimic kings; but they never saw such a nice observance of forms. Also, let the figare of the king receive attention-not merely because he is represented by Mr. Charles Kean, for that fact has already been acknowledged by numerous plaudits-but on accounts of its historical significance. Who does not remember the trim, beardless Richard IL, who, in the conventional portraits of our sovereigns, looks so weak after the heavy-bearded EdwvardITIL Well, there he is alive again, striving to look business-like and important in the presence of those two brawling barons. What a pity that a Crown in the middle ages was not a sinecure I What a pity that Richard IL could not be a Louis XV., and Bolingbroke a Duc de iRichelieu l
Passing over a fine iterior, with polychrome ornaments (representing a "room in the Duke of Lancaster's palac'), we find onrselves on "Gosford-green, near Coventry," where the lists are setup for the contest between Bolingbroke and Norfolk. The same artifice that was employed to make the hail of Sardanapalas seem interminally long is again employed on this occasion. The "grand stand" (as it would now be called), with the king in the best place, and a long file of nobles, in all the eccentric hcaddresses of the 14th century, slants off, so that you have no distinct notion where it begins and where it ends. Masterly, indeed, are the details belonging to the preparation of that combat wbich was never fought. Those same old barons when they had a private encounter might belabour each other irregularly enough, but when they fought a judicia battle they had their forms as accunrately set down as the most prosaic routine of writ, appearance, declaration, plea, and issue. With such conscientious accuracy are all those forms observed that the spectator of the scene may fancy himself to be articled to a chivalric olicitor, and busied in the study of one of the most venerable departments of English law. That Bolingbroke and Mowbray axe provided with a real horso a piece is the infinitessimal part of the affair. Already, too, the developement of the characters has begun. Mr. C. Kean, as Richard, discourses graciously with Bolingbroke,-anSwers Mowbray with visible dislike. The distinction is accurately drawn, and obvious is the mistake made by the luckless monarch. Everybody in the house can see that the stalwart Bolingbroke-of whom Mr. Ryder is an excelent representative-is but feigning loyalty, and will snuff out his king on the first opportunity; uhereas that poor Nowbray, who cannot get a kind look, will simply saunter out of the kingdom and die of a broken heart. The whole story of the scene is told to perfectLion.
The second act opens with a " room in Ely-house"-the room where Jobn of Gaunt dies,-not to be surpassod as a representation of a baronial interior, not only is arcbseological accuracy shown in all the decorative details, but a picture is produced in accordance -with the sentiment of the situation. A man is dying-a man of Royal race; his bedathetefore, is of thaosoliest, his gaudy trappings still cleave to him, but his approaching fate is synboli2ed by the sombre tone of the room, rendered more portentous by the dim red glow of the fire. But the dying man is rot only of Royal race,-he is the man whose death is almost immediately followed by the complicatod series of dvil disorders that, interrupted for a while by tho victories of Henry V., continues till the accession of the Tudors Such a man has a rightto be aseer; as a seer he isrepresentedbySbakspeare, and in this capacityhe is exhibited with singular effect at the Princess's Theatre. The bed, with its rich dark hangings, becomes a Pythian tripod, and an awvful personage is the expiring Duke, with his quaint pc:ited beard and haggard countenance. Nor does Mr. Walter Lacy, who represents him, ignore the grandeur of h is words. On the contrary, he makes of himself a very imposing decal prophet. But this solemnity is not appreciated by the wrong-headed King, vwho grows insolent and brutal in the chamber of his dying uncle. The ignoble rage is weU assumed by Mr. Charles Eean; it is the sort of wrath that may occasion temporary alarm, but cannot command respect.
That lovely landscape entitled the " Wilds of Glocestershire," which (after a beautiful soene of the entrance to St. Stephen's Chapel, Westminster) follows the representation of Gaunt's death, and which, with the open country on one side and the avenue of trees on the other, looks so cool and refreshing after the sultry splendour of Ely-house, is now peopled with forms that augur no good to the feeble monarch. Crossbow-men traverso a wooden bridge, and are followed by heavy armed comrades, and the power of Bolimgbroke may be conjectured froni the fact that neither the beginning nor the end of this company is visible. A new episode of medimeval life is exhibited, a "rising," as it was called, with steel-clad chieftains as its head and a train of vassals as its body. In this scene too,the Duke of York, the medLeval prototype of the Vicar of Bray, makes a very good figure in the person of MIr. John Cooper, who, with his measured elocution and his cloth-of-gold robe, becomes the most apt representative of that repectability of which York is the incarnation. Re walks upon the stage with such an air of virtuous wiath, and is so anxious to let Bolingbroke know that he is "no traitor's uncle," that the change is almost ludicrous when be sneaks after the rest, and with sundry misgivings in his heart becomes himself a rebel, painfully convinced that rebellion is the safest course.
It is in the third act that Richard first becomes an object of sympathy. Previously he has appeared as a weak and capricious tyrant, without one single quality to command respect, but now misfortune begins to press him down with a hand so heavy that his private defects are forgotten, and the indignities offered to his rank are aloneeconspicuous. The figure of Richard II. as it is imprinted on the memory is that of a mourner over the mutability of human grandeur, and of aU his speeches those that are most familiar belong to him in this capscity. Few rocollect his ill-behaviour at the bedside of the dying Gaunt, but the proposition.
"Within the hollow crouw
That rounds the mortal temples of a king Keeps Death his court,"
w;ith all its melancholy consequences is fresh in everybody's mind.
Islilford harbour, at which the rapid transition from joy to sotrow takes place, is represen'ted by a beautiful picture, in which Pembroke Castle and a fleet of old-fashioned ships, both on authority, are conspicuous objects. The whole
scene is bright and cheerful, and when Richard klsses the earth on Vis return from Ireland, confident in tho
itrength of his name and his dignity, tho aspect of affairs is altogether hopefuL If anyono is disposed to think somewhat seriously of Bolingbroke and his movements richard has a theory of "Divine right" at his fingers ends, with which to ansver any "discomfortable cousin. "
"Not xU the water in the rough rude sa
"Can wash the balm from an anointed king: " For every man thatBolingbroko bath press'd "To lift sharp steel against our golden crown, " God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay

" Weak men must fall for Heaven stilll guards the right."
These are tho grand words of the confident monarch, and one might almost fancy that Shakspoare intended them as a qulet satire against absolutist doctrines, since two minutes do not elapso beforo their fallacy is exposed. With aU his
'b lm" and all his "1 angels" Richard is almost immediately informned by intrusive Salisbry that his cause isaltogetber
hopeless. The blank that comes over him is finely expressed by Mr. Charles Kean. How could a man look otherwie than blank whose hopes and whose theory are demolished at the seme time-who feels tlat he is at once overthrown as a
king and refuted as a logician2 -NAvertheless, he plucks lp cure-return to hisfavourite flacy, and ssouUtiR -..

tbat hiscreatures bave beenbeheaded atBrstolhedrow into a state of reflective sorrow, from whichlihe scarcely reives again. The excitement in this scene is produced br the sudden leaps of the King's mind from a state cf feeling tG its opposite, which are as ridble to the eye as a series of physical acts, and most effectively are they performia by Mfr. Charles Kean. - t
In the interview between Richard and Bolingbroke ii entirely new stage arrangement is contrived. The restors. ion of Flint Castle is not only of antiquarian interest, bq1 the construction of the edifice, consitting of two minssih towers, with a connecting drawbridge, on which the tem:porary inmates first appear, conduces to a pictorial eom:. position of singular beauty. In this scene Bolingbroke for the last time puts on a show of hurmiUty beforehis Sov reign, and Mr. C. Kean, to indicate the quickness-with whick poor Ricliard sees through the hypocrisy of his conquetol?, adopts a reading of which the late Edmund Kean is thb reputed inventor.
"Up, cousin, up; your heart is up I know,
Thus high at least, although your knee be low."
These are the words of Richard to his kneeling kinsman; and the pecaliar interpretation consists in uttering the perr mission to rise, first in a tone of bland condescension, and then finishing tho sentence with a burst of wrath and a smart tap on the forehead to signify that " thus high" meas as high as the seat of the Royal diadem.
The drop scene has fallen on the third act, aud the audience are reposing from their contemplation of the glittering pageant and their sympathy with Royal sorrow, when they are startled from their torpor by a peal of bells, rung after the fashion that denotes some great public festivity. 'hese bells, be it remarked, are not orchestral imitations, babt re real ecclesiastical instruments, sounded in really ecclesiastical style. The curtain is withdrawn; a London street is discovered, vith festoons slung across the road, with platforms trembling under a load of anxious speotators, withr crowds at every window. All the excitement that occurs on the occasion of a Royal or Imperial visit is reproduced, not only with accuracy, but with lifer while the varied costumes of tho 14th century cause an appearance of gaiety not to be attained in modem Cheapside. Vagabond c aterers to public amusement loved then as now to take advantage of a crowd, and accordinglr a lively dance of "itinerant fools" precodes the political exhibition, Folly goes-(not till it has beenencored)-andt then aprocession of representatives of the city companies. all armed, passes along the stage, entering at the back, and. retiring by one of the front wings. A pause. A murmur denotes that Bolingbroke is approaching, and presently the popular favourtto makes his appearance on horseback. What a waiving of hats and handkerchief&: on the part of the pcople,-what a courteous profession of gratituxde on the part of the idol of the day r The road and every ono of the windows is replete with life, and there aro enough waves of the feathered cap to greet it all. Another pause. King Richard, also on horseback, appears amid a sulky silence, which is soon converted into' brawling execration. The change from the representation
of popular idolatry into that of popular contempt is mos)I imarvellous. Not only is a scene of the past recalled, but also the sensations belonging to it.
The tabkcauc just described forms what is called "a historical episode" between the third and fourth acts, As there is no such scene in Shakspeare, the interpolation wil doubtless be regard ed with infinite disgust by all thos6
purists who here not w itnessed the performance. As for those who have witnessed it-whether purists or not-they
-ill be only too ready to pardon a delinquency that has led to such a marvellous result.
If Richard has become an object of sympathy while her floundered between the theory of "Divino right" and the' practical buffets of advers e fortune, he becomes an object of respect when he formally abdicates his crown in Westminster-hall. To give fuU effect to the pathos of this most pathetic position Mr. Charles Kean has exerted all his histrionic power. Never was a mo re mournful figure than this same Plantagenet with Rtoyalty shorn off. In the days of his prosperity he did not look very august, his Royal indignahon never rose above the level of bad temper, but now her issunk so very low tha t you remember that he is a King-, afterall-afactyou were constantlyinclined to forget so long as his crown was on his head. His rage is nowrespecthblo, and everybody is on his side when he upbraids Northumberland, the " haught, insulting man," for torturing him. when he has abandoned every thing. Why should he be annoyed any more? He has givon up his crown, not quite without a pang, and he onlo wants to be miserable without importinent interruption.
" I thought yoU had be en willing to resign," says Bolingbroke.
" My crown I am; ubt still my griefs are mine,"
retortsRicho,rd,andmosttouehingis the accent of grief which be gives to the latter part of the statement. Still more ptthetic is tho overwhelming sorrow which takes po3session of I im when the brutal Northumberland insists that he shall read the catalogue of his own crimes HO cries liko a child. He has undergone every form of privation and calamity that adverse fortune could inflict upon him, except self-degradation,xand nowvthat comes also. The misery of this sensation and theorageowhich is its natural reaction are finely conceived and executed by Mr. Charles Kean. With respect to its decorations, this scene is as perfect a reproduction of mediival life as the lists on Gosford-green.
When in front of an admirable picharo, representing the 'Traitors'-gato" of the Tower, and comingin momrnful contrast with the glittering displays that have preceded It, the Qneen bids farewvellto her deposed husband, woefindaout at last why Mrs. Charles Kean has undertaken a part so Ultpromising. The horror which she has evinced in the fourth act, while listening to the gardener's conjectures as to the fate of Richard, is, indeed, finely portrayed-; but one start is, after all, a small object. The character has been left as a mere sketch by the poet, and, far from any historical associations being connected with it, an inaccuraoy has been. committed by making a child of nine years old a full-grown. woman. In the parting scene, howover, Mrs. Rean shows how a.cousummate artist can make a great deal out of & scanty nateriaL This shadowy, unsbstantial Queen can be supposed a remarkable instance of feminine devotion, and' the words she utters, though not many, bear out the suppoiition. On this hypothesis Mrs. Kean, when Richard is tornx from her arms, displays such an agony of tearful grief, is so completely broel;n up with heartrending sorrowv, tlat, although the paeantry of the play is over, this sceno is one of the most effective of tho whole performanco. eWhen the hapless King has departed sho ecarries out still furthor her illustration of the feeling by rushlng towards the parapet and leaning over it to catch a last glumpso of the he. object, whlo tho sucoceding decoration cloees upon. her.
We have now enumerated the principal " effects," decorative and histrionic, that belong to this most remarkable revival. Or rather we have stated where the "effects' occur, for the wealth of archbeological detail lavished on the Foenes aDd the costumes is almost beyond the reach of irnagination, much more that of description. As a wellknown connoisseur of dramatic art remarked in the stalls, on the first night of performance, the whole work is mnor
like the production of a society of antiquaries than thec result of a single manager's energy and genius.
The Late Colliery Explosion Near Barnsley.
rTlE LAm CoLunOY EXPLOSION NEAR BARNSLEY. -We have previously stated that water was being poured itr the LUhdhill pit for the purposo of extinguishin the ifze, which had rendered necessary the closing of the
fin'diatelyafter the explosion, and prevented the recovery Of the bodies left in the pit. During Friday the water had reached such a height ui the downcast shaft as would, in the opinion of the engmeers who have underkakon the managemaent, extinguish the fire. On Saturday the engineers n.et,t the offices o a comiany, nnd the running of water into the pit was stopped. The temperature of tbe water in the upoast ebaft, about which the fire most raged, was found to be only a few degrees above that of the water on the surfacc, indicating, as the temperature of the pit is naturaDy greater than that on the surface at this season of the year, that tho fire was, if not alt*gether, very nearly extinguished. The pumping-shaft extending only to ua upper seam of coal& the pumping apparatua is not. available for emptying the water from the flooded serm, and iron cisterus, capable of containing about 600 gallons of water each, have been procured for the purpose of drawing out the water. Tho cage on which the ciserns will ascend and escend has already been fixed, with new ropes attached, :. and it is expected that operations foremptying the pits Oill be at onoe commenood. The appeal made on behalf of the bereaved has been most liberal responded to. The central committee, which ham its bead-quarters at Earnsley, has already received sub. scriptions to the amount of 5,0001, which amount doeit not include a large Rart of the subscriptions received in Sheffield and other neighbouring towns. In Sheffield alone the subscriptions have already reached 1,1001., and no return has yet been made by a large number of persons wh, have obtained cards for the collection of anbecriptions ia their manufactories, offices, worksho , &c. Not less than from 6,0001. to 7,0001. have probably,'therefore tl bee
given, ad it is expected that that amount wil be sti fur, ther augmented. This is not an excessive amount to provide for about 90 widows and 19D orpban children, with soine other less direct claims. It is intende
f pomble, to accomplish another object by rmDt of the subwciVtions, and that is tho formation of an insti tution to provide for the bereaved not only by such exteli..

[A portlon of the following appeared In our second edi. teon of Saturday. -1
PARIS, MAIcn 13, 6 P.M.
Despatchea have been received this morning from the French Minister at Berlin; they doubtless relate to the NeuchMtel question, which has the disadvantage of wearing out every one's patience, except perhaps that of the King of lI?uasia. It is said that MA. Rosenberg is expected on Monday to take part in the negotiations. If it be true, as a Berlin paper affirms, that the Paris Conference has not the right to solve the question, it might as well dissolve itself at once. The new instructions are said to be to the effect that the recognition of his rights of sovereignty is the express condition of HisMajesty's renunciation of that sovereignty. The Emperor, I presume, now sees cause to regret his extreme condescension to the King, and rhaps, but for the esteem in which M. de Hatzeldt is personally held at the Court of the Tuileries, his disappointment would be manifested more strongly.
Letters were issued yesterday convoking an extraordinary meeting of the Council of State for this day, under the presidency of the Emperor. The object of the meeting was to come to some decision on the long-vexed question of the tax on personal property. The impost itself, as well as the best mode of laying it on, has been discussed over and over again, and has almost turned the heads of financiers. The only thing all seem unanimous about is the necessity of providing for the deficit by some tax or other. The newest project is the imposition of I5c. on every 100f. of each share or "obligation," whether French or foreign, taking as the basis the average valur of such securities for the last three years.
It appears the Russian Government has sent orders to Bordeaux for the construction of a screw steam frigate of 500-horse power, to carry 60 guns, a zcrew steam corvette of 400-horse power for 30 guns, and a paddle-wheel steam yacht of 400-horse power, forthespecial service of the Czar. These vessels,which weie ordered three months ago, are far advanced towards completion. The corvette will be launched in May, the frigate in September, and the yacht in December. Other orders of a similar kind are stated to have been also received.
A communication from the Gulf of Mexico, in the Monitcur de la Flotte, corroborates the statement in my letter of yesterday that General Comonfort had sold to an American company a tract of land in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, with the right to cut a canal to unite the Atlantic to the Pacific. The plan of canalizing the Isthmus of Tehuantepec is said to be very old, and has been frequently revived within the last 50 years. The intention attributed to the company is to unite the rivers HuascuaJco and ChimalapiUa by a canal which will be about 35 miles long, and thus connect the two oceans. The writer of the article asserts that competent judges think it the most practicable and least expensive plan yet suggested. It says:-
"The province of Oaxaca, in which the land grantel to the American company is situate, is one of the most fertile in the Mexican Confederation. The climate is good, and it contains much mineral wealth. The capital is in the rich vaUey granted by Spain to the descendants of Hernan Cortes, and from which they derive the title of Marquis del Valle. The treaty now in question was signed at Mexico oa the 25th of January last, but it is not to be definitive until it is ratified by the Government of the United States. The price to be paid by the company is $25,000,000. The numerous enemies of General Comonfort attack this treaty. They assert, and not without some reason, that it tends to a future annexation with the Unitp!d States, as it introduces the Americans to the centre of Mexico."
The plan of M. Ferdinand de Lesseps for uniting the Mediterranean with tho Red Sea by means of a ship canal across the Isthmus of Suez was referred for consideration to the Academy of Sciences of the Imperial Institute of France. The Academy appointed a commission, composed of MM. Elie de Beaumont, the perpetual secretary Cordier, Dufrenay, Baron Charles Dupin, and Vice-Admiral Dupetit-Thouars. Baron Charles Dupin was appointed to prepare the report, which he has done, and in it he gives M. de Lesseps' plan his full and entire approbation. He then compares the Suez Canal with the Euphrates Railway. Hee shows the very different character of the two works, and he demonstrates the incontestable superiority of the canal for the transport of merchandise over the railway.
The following paragraph, from the Pays, the Government journal, corroborates the statements I made some days since relative to an expedition to be sent to the China Seas by the French Government:-
I It has been said that a convention was signed betweca France and England to regulate the mode of co-operation between the two Powers in the affairs of China, and it was added that France had engaged to furnish an expeditionary corps of 20,000 men agaixfst the Celestial Empire. We con. aider it necessary to correct both statements. There has nob been any convention, properly so called, signed between the two Governments. There was merely an exchange of notes, which is sufficient; and, as to the very exaggerated amount of the expedition, it is reduced to the already known fast of ships and warlike stores placed under the command of Rear-Admiral Rigault de Genonilly."
The Imaum of Muscat, whosb death on board a British frigate was lately announced, having left no legitimate heir, I am informed the English and French Governments, being the only Powers having representatives in the late Imaum's dominions, have declared in favour of Rilal, the eldest of his illegitimate sons.
It is said that the French Government has decided that the debt due to it by the Greek Government shall be remitted, and the Emperor expresse3 a hope that all the money due to France, and coming due by the Greek Government, wil be expended on useful public works in the interior of Greece.
A concert was given last night at the Palace of the Tuileries. There were about 1,500 persons invited. The well-known composer, M. Blumenthal, who is on his return from Nice, performed a solo on the piano, which was much applauded, and for which he was complimented by the Emperor and Empress. M. Allard played a solo on the violin, which was equaly well received.
A private letter from Nice speaks very favourably of the health of the Dowager Empress of Russia. She has derived great benefit from her sojourn there. She takes much exercise on foot and in her carriage, which is nearly an open one. It is thought she wiU leave Nice for Rome about the end of March. She will then set out for Wildbad for the baths, and will probably return to Russia at the end of June. She intends spending the Holy Week at Rome.
The Pays announces that the first two battaUons of the 7th Regiment of Austrian Infantry had arrived on the 4th at Ozernowitz, the capital of the Bukovina, coming from Jassy, where they formed part of the garrison. The evacuation of the Danubian Provinces was proceeding without interruption, and it is expected by the French Government that it wiU be complete in a very few days.
The receipts of the Paris and Orleans Railway Company for the week ending the 4th of March amount to 1,185,355f. 13c., being an increase of 226,813f. S0c. as compared with the corresponding week of last year. The receipts from the 1st of January to the 4th of March amount to 9,450,182f. 67c., being an increase of l,677,594f. 61c. as com pared withthe corresponding periodof the year 1856.

SAURDAY, 6 P.Mr. The Moniktw contains the following -
"The Council of State held its third sitting at the Tuileries yesterday. The Emperor presided. It was determined that the law imposing a tax on the shares and bonds of joint-stock companies shall be as follows :-'The tax imposed by the law of the 5th of June, 1850, for the stamp and transfer of those securities shaU bh raised from
5 to 15 centimesfor each 100f. of capital, regulated every three years by the average price. This tar shall be annal and obl:gatory, and nothing shall be changed in the prent mode of collecting it as It is regulated by the law of 1850A publip administrative regulation shall determine the manner according to which this law shall he applied to foreign securities negotiated in France."'
The law of June 5, 1850, referred to in the above aTticle, relates to stamps on commercial bills, on commercial lists, shares in companies, bonds issaed by departments, communes, public establishments and companies, and on policies of insurance. In the portion referring to shares the bill enacts that from the 1st of January, 1851, every share shall be subjected to a proportional stamp of 50c. per 100f. of the nominal capital of such companies as shall not have a duration of more than 10 years, and of If. per 100f. on those entitled to exist for a longer period. But all companies are permnitted to relieve themselves from that obligation on condition of entering into an arrangement with the State (called an abonnem7lent) for the wvhole length of the company's concession, by payg an annual gum of Sc. for every 100f. of the nominal value at which the share is issued. The companies have almost invariably adopted this latter system, and it is to it that the article in the Moniteur refers in speaking of the 5c. for each 100f. By the new regulation the 5c. is not to be levied on the nominal value of a share, but on its real value, as ascertained by the average quotations on the Bourse for three years. Thus, the Credit Mobilier share would not have to pay on 500f., the value at which it was issued, but on, say, 1,400£, the real value in the
market. In place, therefore, of paying 25c. a-year, i at the rate of 6c. for every 100f., it would have to s pay 15c. for every 100f., or 2f. 10c. each year-that is, 15c. for each of the 100f. in 1,400f. The new tax is, in fact, a sort of income-tax on the securities of companies. As to the mode of payment, it is to remain as heretofore-that is, the amount is to be paid at the registration-office of the place where the seat of the company is situated, and without any expense to the State.
A letter from Parma, of the 8th inst., informs us that the Austrian Government is endeavouring with redoubled ardour to arive at a renewal of the Customs'League, or at the concludon of some description of a treaty of commerce with the Government of Parma. The Austrian Government, according to the writer of the letter, is never discouraged by the failure of a plan, but by changing the form it hopes to obtain the substance. The Ministers of the
Duchess Regent had as yet, however, resisted all ! applications. The Government is aware that not! only is the prosperity of the inhabitants. at stake, I but lik;ewise public tranquillity, wihich might be ! seriously compromised bysubmittingto the Austrian
conditions. The public regard a Customs' LjeagueI with Austria as tantamount to converting the Duchyj of Parma into an Austrian province, and they would not endure it. The Government hadadopted
no resolution with regard to the important questionI of raifways, which is the more to be regretted as the trunk line from Piacenzato StradeLa, which is of great importance to the Duchy, might be easily completecl. The obstacles come from the Ausrian Government. Signor Cattani, the Minister of the Interior, promizes that something shall be shortly done. The trial of political prisoners, which was to lhave been resumed this month, has, at the request of the advocates, been adjourned to the month of May next.

MARSEILLEMS, MARcH 13.
The Egyptus, which arrived here yesterday with the mails fromn Constantinople, experienced a hurricane in her passage through the Archipelago. Twro seamen were swept off the deck, and were afterwards most providentially saved. One was carried back by a wave, which dashed himn with great violence against the mast. The other was saved by the courage of four men, who, notwithstanding the violence of the gale, launched a boat and recovered him after he had been nearly an hour in the water. The north-west wind, which has prevailed here for the last two days, blowing with extreme violence, has prevented any vessel from leaving the port. The Sully, which was advertised to sail for Stern, the Tharsis, for Barcelona, the Var, for Nice, and the Rhone, for Cette, are all windbound in the docks.-
AUSTRIA.

VIENNA, MARCH 11. ' While the Austrian Monarch and his Ministers were at Milan one or two important events occurred which are not yet known to the public. The
Bishops took advantage of the presence of their I Sovereign, and strongly urged him to make further concessions to the Papal chair,but the lust of power and the impatience of control which the reverend gentlemen betrayed produced no agreeable impression on His Majesty, who referred them to the Mlinister of the Interior. That high functionary is
a most devoted son of the Church, but he is I probably of opinion that Austria has ceded enough of her power to the Court of Rome, for he was afflicted with sudden deafness whenever the Bishops broached the subject which they had so much at heart. Instead of giving the Papal Chair more influence than it already enjoys in Austria, the Emperor gave His Holiness a hint that it would be as well if the impetuosity of the LombardoVenetianhierarchy received a check. Indeed, there is reason to believe that a note in the above-mentioned sense was forwarded to Rome while the Ministers were still at Milan. It has not failed to attract attention that no order or other sign of favour has been given by His Majesty to the Bishops of Bergamo and Pavia, who are the most bigoted and violent of the Austro-Italian prelates. The remark of Count Cavour, " that he, as a Roman Catholic, condemned the Austrian Concordat, but as a Sardinian politician highly approved it," has not failed to attract the attention of those politicians who foretold that Austria would have cause to rue her convention with Rome. Some of the Vienna correspondents of the German papers write that there is a " conflict" between the civil and clerical authorities, but such is not the case, for the former invariably obey the behests of the latter. The thunders of the Jesuit preachers are just at present directed against General Baron Kempen, the Chief of the Austrian Poliee, who is compared to Pontius Pilate, and declared to be no better than one of the vicked. Baron Kemnen
has given great offence to the Ultramontane party by declining to permit it to take the direction of all matters connected with the public press into its hands.
The Governor-General of the Lombardo-Vene. tian kingdom is to remain Commander-in-Chef of the Austriannavy. Baron Bach, the Minister of the Interior, arrived here yesterday from Milan. The Ministerial Councillor Maximiian von Gagern is gone to Brussels, as Plenipotentiary of the
Austrian Court, to settle the conditions of the contract of manriage between the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian and the Princess Charlotte of Bel]gium. The Grand Duke of Tuscany, with the whole of his family, met their Majesties at Mantua. The Duke of Modena, the brother-in-law of the Duke de Bordeaux, had a (political?) rheu! matism, andwasunable togotoMantuato payhis respects to the head of his family. Four Italiau tobili, Messrs. Peter and Joseph Venieri, and Messrs. Bernard Caboga and Papadopoli, have been made Aulstrian Couints.
SPAIN.
(uMO. OUI R OWN CORRESPON DIXT.)
MADRID. MARcH 10.
The Gazette contains various appointments and promotions in the D^partment of Grace and aus 'ce, and, among several derees of no general interest, one authorising the formation of the Company of RXailways from Seville to erez and from
Puerto Reale-to -Cadiz, of which 30 per cent. of the capital has been paid up, aud which is bound to commence its operations within one month of the date of the decree.
Senor Sorels, late Spanish Mini5ter in Mexico, has arrived at Cadiz, and is expected here. The Mexican correspondent of the (r6niea says that the man-of-war sent by General Concha to receive him at Vera Cruz had on board Colonel Llorente, the General's secretary, who availed himself of his short stay in that port to take notes and Sketches and to reconnoitre the coast, with a view to the disembarcation of an expedition. The same correspondent complains of the bad faith displayed bj the Mexican Government in this dispute, and of it3 disregard of the official explanations given, not only by Senor Sorela, but by FIr. Lettiom, the Englis'
'Cbarge d'A^ffaires, of the farmer's sdtimatum, whic'i demanded satisfaction within eight days, and noFr as the Mexicans affected to believe, the imprisonmient and punishment of the guilty person within that peremptory term. The letter proceed to saythat if the expedition takes place it will prove a mere militarypromeiade, but that lt is probable Mexico will accept any conditions rather than engage in a war she cannot sustain. This view of the case is rather sanguine, and does not take into account the possible interference, direct or underhand, of the United States. The treaty said to have been concluded between the States and Mexico, in virtue of which the former Power is to lend the latter $15,000,000, receiving as security a mortgage of the Customs' duties to the extent of 15 per cent. of their produoe, is rather significant at this moment. It looks very much as if the States were supplying Mexico with funds to oppose Spain, anc excites fresh appre hensions an the minds of those persons (and they aro not a few) who believe that the Americans: have been and are fomenting the quarrel in the expectation that out of it will arise favourable pretexts and opportunities for prosecuting theirlona cherished designs upon Cuba. It is this apprehension that makes the Spanish Government very unwiling to go to war with Mexico, and it would unquestionably be glad if its present loud note of preparation had the effect of intimidating its 0?ponent, and of leading to the granting of such satisfaction as it could decently accep'. The mission of Senor La Fragua, who is said to have been several times Minister in Mexico, and to have left his post at the head of the Home Department in order to come to Spain as a pacificator, may give some hopes of such a result, unless, indeed, it be merely a device to gain time, as is not improbable, if it be really the case that the United Statea are urging and backing Mexico in the quarrel. With respect to the treaty and the loan of $15,000,000, the New York correspondent of a Madrid paper says that, according to letters from Mexico, there are secret articles, and that the real guarantee is Sonora and the extensive province of Telhuantepec. Should this statement be well founded you will, doubtless, have reliable information on the subject by a more direct channel. As regards the general question of a war with Mexico, many disbelieve that it will come to actull hostilities, while those who are less confident of a pacific termination of the quarrel have evil forebodings-not with respect to the result of the conflict itself, or even on account of the expense it must entail, and which Spain can iII afford, but on accoant of the island of Cuba, the safety of which they fear will be in some way compromised. It is easy for people in Spain to count up the guns and battalions that protect their precious colony, and to reckon on them for its defence, but I know that their confidence is not shared by many persons who have been on the spot, and in the best position to estimate the chances. What these say is, that let Spain do what she will, and no matter how stanch the garrison and how loyal the colonists of Caba, the island Will be Arerican at no very distant period, unless England and France exert their authority to preserve it to its proper owners. Of course it would be rash to fix a date for such an event, but those who believe that it must ultunately come to pass, and-that it is a mere question of time-basing their opinion on the wellknown craving of the States for Cuba and on the impossibility of Spain -making head alone ag,ainst the power of the Union-are naturally uneasy when, as at present, circumstances arise that seem not
nlikely to afford an opening for American aggression.
The mansion of the Duke de Medina Celi, described by Ford as looking like ten houses taken out of Baker-street, and which was considerably damaged in July last year by General Serrano's cannonade, is now nearly repaired. The papers give an account of a magnificent electric clock that is to surmount it, having several faces, one of which, fronting the salon, or chief promenade on the Prado, will show, besides the hour, the day and month, and the changes of the moon. There is to be a aiu,on, or peal of bells, which will play an air as often as the hour strikes. The airs are to be 16 in number, selected from those Spanish melodies most popular in the provinces where the Duke has estates-that is to say, in nearly every province of Spain.

The Persian War And The Persian Treaty.
THE PERSIAN WAR AND THE PERSIAN
TBRATY.
TO THE EDITOP OF THE TIM]ES.
Sir,-ne Times was the first paper to denounce the Persian war, and the promulgation of the treaty giv.s Rersia and The Times their triumph. Since the Convention of Cintra the present is the first occasion on which, while triumphant in the field, 'with the shouts of victory till ringing in our ears, we have surzendered everything for which we fought, andmadeourlaurelsover to ourvanquished enemies. The various provisions of the treaty up to the last are simple renewals of stipulations formerly in force, with no more guarantee for their execution than that which we before possessed. We are something worse than this. We are now proceeding under a bad precedent. To a country without faith, without honour, character, credit, or position, an expedition which leaves behind it somo millions of rupees, the bulk of which will in the long run reach the Royal treasury, is anytbing but undesirable. So far from there being any humiliation confessed to by our enemy, Persia already tells us she never meant to keep Herat. She went there merely to assist the sons of a former chief in the recovery of their rights, and would never have dreamt of going at all had she supposed that her advance would have offended us. She tells us-falsely, of course-that the Governor of Bushire was instructed to withdraw should we approach, aud that he and the garrison failed to defend the town because they were forbidden to resist us. After all, the capture of Bushire was not much to brag of. The official return shows that out of 68 guns captured by us six only were serviceable, the heaviest of these being an 18-pounder. Against this not very formid. able armament we had 13 ships-of-war, armed with 48 and 68 pounders, and nearly as many gunboats, mounted with 32-poundes, the latter being, not very marvelously, found superfluous I
If our commercial relations with Persia have hitherto been less satisfactory, as stated by Lord Clarendon, than those of other Powers, we have ourselves to blame for it. No country has wasted one-tenth of the money that we have in maintaining our friendly relations with Persia. No country but England, which commands her seaboard, can compel such prompt attention to her wishes. The trade between Bombay and the Persan Gulf alohe is above half a miUion sterliag annually-the principal item being horses, which India alone can take off her hands. If, under circumstances such as these, we have submitted to a commercial position with Persia inferior to that which Russia and France enjoy, the circumstance is peculiarly disgraceful to us.
The point which we have conceded is peculiarly one of honour, and it is this concession which gives Persia her triumph, as out of this arose at least a poraion of our quarrel.
There has from time immemorial existed throughout the East the usage that the procincts of the residences of European Ambassadsors shall furnish a sanctuary for all to whom it is thought fit to give protection. At Constantinople, Alexandria, Zanzibar, or wherever else there are European Ambassadors, a native of the country needs only to seek protection,-to become, under any form or fiction, a servant or uUac1u,-and he is safe from the laws of his own country and anger of his Sovereign. It was out of this that the Murray and Mr. Hashem quarrel arose. The Shah admitted that we might protect the husband, while he detained the owfe. Now, we formally abandon all claim to protect either the one or the other-this, too, at a time when Russia and France retain so long as it suits them the distinguished psivilege we forego. What is this but giving the glory to Persia, who tells the world she did not lose but gave up of her own free will and accord Bushire, and can now beast that she has compelled England to relinquish the most fondly-cherished of her rights, and which no other European Power has as yet offered or been called upon to surrender ?
Surely, Sir, now, having given Persiaher own way inevery. thing, and conceded much more than she ever could have dreamt of asking, we had better at once order the magnificent army resting on their arms at Bushire to embark at once in the transports ready at anchor for their use to carry them to China, or wherever elsethey are required. An order sent out by next mail wil be in time to enable them to reach Hongkong before the heats become excessive, or the rains or storms set in.
No troops ever were in better condition to sail or to fight
The best commentary on the state of the arrangements for transport lies in the facts that 13 ships of war and 30 transports, with nearly 16,000 human beings and close on 2,000 horses on board, were transferred from India to Persia without the loss of a single mau (three horses being aU ths casualties), and reached their destination in such perfect condition as to go next day into action.
The army of hardened, seasoned, and experienced veterans under General Ontram wiU be snug under canvass, on Chinese gronnd, before General Pennefather and his raw levies have rounded the Cape.
I remain, Sir, yours, &c.,

Hlis HoNoun gavo judgment in this case, which was a Euit by the executors of an old lady named Barnes, to set aside a deed executed by her in October, 185, on the ground that Mrs. Barnes did not know either the real na.ture of the document she signed, or that it contained no power of revocation. Mrs. Barnes appeared to have been ono of those old women who are constantly making dispositions of their property, and then altering their minds as to the particular recipients of their bounty, and in exercise of her powers of disposal was repeatedly drawing up deeds in favour of one person or another, and then revoking them. The deed now sought to be set asido embraced some 18 or 20 bcntiaircs, and Mrs. Barnes to her amazement found, after sho had executed it, that there was no power of revocation given to her uider it. Irritated at her occuphtion being thus curtailed, Mrs. Barnes instituted a suit in Chancery to set the deed aside, and it was this suit her executors were now prosecuting. The Court, on the grounds that Mrs. Barnes had repudiated the deed in her lifetime, and had sworn she did not understand its nature or its restriction, and that the deed itself was voluntary and w;ithout consideration, made a decree for its being set aside, at the same time intimating that neither the trustees of the deed nor the lawyers employed in draw. lag it up were in any wvay to blame, and directing that the costs of the suit should come out of Mrs. Barnes's estate.

This was a petition for the purpose of obtaining payment out of eourt of a sum of 250M, being the purchase-money of land of which the petitioner was formerly owner, and which had been taken in June, 1I84, by the Chelsea Waterworks Company for the purposes of their undertaking. The only question in the case was whether there had been such a wilful neglect on the part of the petitioner to make out a good title to the above land as would throw the burden of paying the costs of this petition on that individual. The petitioner and the company being unable to come to terms as to the value of that land, a jury was summoned under the provisions of the Lands Clauses Consoldation Act (1845) to asse its value, and on the 5th of December, 1854 a verdict was found for the petitioner for 2501. Early in June, 1855, the company, under the compulsory clauses of the above Act, took another pieee of land belonging to the petitinner, but of very small extent, being abut 21 feet by S feet, and on the 8th of December, 1855, they paid into court the sum of 2501., being the purchase-money for the land furst! taken. Subsequently to the day last mentioned the petitioner delivered an abstract of title of the laud first taken by the compay. The petitioner's case -was that he had delayed to deliver that abstract of title until the company and he had arranged as to the amount to be paid by the former for the land last taken by them; whereas the company contended that the petitioner should have delivered before June, 1854-as it was alleged he had been repeatedly required to do-an abstract of the title to the first piece of land, and that his not having done so was such a wilful neglect on his part to make out a good title as should throw the costs of this petition on him under tho 80th section of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act (1845.)
lr. Sheffield appeared for the petitioner, and Mr. F. O. Jaynes for the company.
I he VICE-SCHcFLLoR *was of opinion that there had not been a mlful neglect on the part of the petitioner to make out a good title to the land first taken by the company, and directed the costs of this petition to be paid by the latter.

Mr. HARDY moved on behalf of the plaintiffs that the Clerk of Records and Writs might be directed to file replication to the defendant's answer in this suit.
Mr. W. s JarES and Mr. J. H. TAYLOR, instructed by the solicitor to the Suitors' Fund, submitted to the Court that the officers had properly refused to file replication in this case. The defendant had filed an answer purporting to be an answer to the biUl of complaint, but in which he continually referred to another document which he called his
!printed answer," and which he had procured to be marked as an exhibit. A mong other passages in the document actnaly filed tho defendant prayed that the printed answer might be taken as part of that his answer, and begged to repeat and depose to each and every of the allegations and statements contained in the printed answer as if they had actually been engrossed and formed part of the parchment filed and he further stated that to have had a copy of the printed answer engrossed wvould have cost upwards of 601., being of great length (nearly 2,000 folios); that the fact of its being printed would be a great saving of expenso both to the plaintiffs and himself and a matter of great convenience . and that for these reasons he was advised and submitted' that the printed answer need not be engrossed or annexed to that his answer, otherwise than as being an exhibit with which, both as regarded deposit and otherwise, he was willing to deal as the Court might direct. And he further stated that he bolieved his printed answer contained his ful defence on the merits. The learned counsel stated to the Court that the answer had been sworn before a London commissioner, who had also marked the exhibt, and that the answer having been brought to the office to be filed without the notiee of the cerk bein drawn to any peculiarity in the framing of it, the parchment had been filed accordingly ; but the attention of the record and writ clerks having been since called to it, they had considered the course taken by the defendant wholly irregular, and had accordingly given directions that no replication thould be filed without the express direction of the court.
br. HErDY, in reply, repudiated any sort of collusion with the defendant in the matter, but submitted that if the plaintiff were content with the answer that had been filed that was sufficient. It might be a question at the hearing of the cause, whether the printed answer did or did not form any part of the answer on the record, but that was a question which the plaintiff was also content should be decided at the hearing, and a decision now would, in fact, be premature. In any case it wouldbe a grave hardship on the plaintiff if an answer of the great length to which the printed document extended were to be forced on the ile against his wish, an offlce copy of which he would be compelled to take.
The VICE-CILA.NPCELLOr. said that the object of a record was that the Court might have everything on the record plain and intelligible, but the result of considering this " thing" which had been filed as an answer, would be that every person who chose to say his answer would cost 50 mauch might file an answer of this k-Ind, and every rocord of the Court might in future consist of a few lines only. A defendant might file one skin of parchment and say, " I have six or eight skins more at home, which it will cost me a large sum to file, and I therefore claim to have them simply marked as an exhibit, and when marked to have them taken as part of my answer." Such a proposition could not be admitted. A case might be made upon special applicationto enable the Court in a particular case to make a special order; but that was not the case here. There was, in fact, no record at all. It would be impossible for the Court at the hearing of tho cause to saywhetherthe "thing" called the printed answer when prodneed was in the same state.as when marked, having remained inthe meanwhile in the custody of the defendant. Under theso circumstances the Court could not allow replication to be filed, there being, in fact, nothing to reply to.
Mr. GsrD, for the defendant, suggested that the plainti should accede to the printod answer being regularly filed.
Mr. H[AIDY, for the plaintiff, mid he ahould concur in amothing, but simply submit to the order which his Honour had made.

That for sene time previous to 18.50 the two sisters had been on friendly terms with Mr. and MoE . Gray, hut -about that time Mrs. GrAy gave them offence, and they were never afterwards reconciled to her; that upon Mr. stoward caing on the deceaseaon the 14thof Jult 1854, she desired him to send for trs.

Steward that she wished to leave her a legacy of 2001., but refused to alter her will, saying she was quite sure Mr. Steward would carry cut her intentions; that the legacy had since been paid; that on Mr. and Mrs. Gray callng to see the deceased oni the 16th of July, she desired that they might not be per. mitted to enter her room; that she was i the habit of burnin old rags, and did not labour under any delusion as to tIme presence of brimstone in the room, inasmuch as one of the nurses was xsing sulphur ointment; that she exhibited mch aneguish of mind at the death of her sister, and gave directions for the funeral.
The wil, after reserveing a life iterest to the sister, gave the whole of her property to Mfr. Steward and Mr. Edwards equally.
Dr. DmiNE (writh whomi was Dr. Spinks) appeared on behalf of the executors, and said that the issue raised was whether the dleceased wasz of sound or unsound mind at the time she gave instructions for and executed the wilL. He submiitted that it was exactly the kind of instrument which she would execute on the day it bore date. From her previous history there was strong evidence of capacity a priori-; from the direct evidence in the case, whether talcen from the witnesses on the one side or the other, there was clear proof of caacit at the time in question. There was evidence of intutosbeing given for the will, of a full knowledge of its contents, of its due execution, and of the subsequ;ent recognition of it on more than one occasion. He contended therefore that the executors were entitled to have the pro. hate delivered out to them.
The QUExiN's ADVOCATE (with -whom 'was Dr. Jenner) maintained, onL behalf of the Crown, that the only queation before the Court was thoecapacity of the deceased on thu day the wil wvas executed. The proof of fucitum rested on the evidence of Mr. Steward, the person chiefly interested under it, and -who wras uncorroborated by any scrap of w-riting in the nature of instructions, or by any one who was present. M1r. Langley, by whom the bill was drawn, did not prove the slightest Knowledge of its contents by the de. ceased. It was a case requiring the fullest proof of capacity, seeing that the deccascd was in articdo smiorlis at the time. The evidence was extremely conflicting, but he contended that that which hadi been produced on the part of the Crown preponderated.
The COURTr reserved its judgment.

(Bcforc the CxEm Co3insISION i)
This insolvent had been a commission-agent in Paris. He was opposed on behalf of a young woman named Mlarie Pubeau, who was assistant to a shopkeeper in Paris. Mr. Nichols supported.
The complant was that the insolvent obtained from the young woman a shawl and other articles of the value of 571., pronising to pay for them on the next day, as he said he hlad a customer vho would purchase the articles. Immnediately he received the articles he left Paris and came to 3,ondon, whither he was followved soon after by Mlademoiselle Pubean, who, having discovered his residence, obtained a Judge's order for his arrest.
The C1EF CO ssniSSsoXEB was of opinion that the insolvent had been guilty of a heartless fraud towards the
oung woman who opposed, and ordered him to be discharged after being in custody for nine calendar months from the date of the vesting order.
(Before MA'r. Commi4sioncr PT11LLIPs.)
In RE WILLItA STROUD.
This insolvent was also a commission-agent, who was op. pooed on the ground of fraud, but to a larger extent. Mr. Dowso appeared for Mr. Powers, a miller in Bedfordshire, for whom the insolvent had been agent. He was now a defaulter to the extent of 3051., havingreceived that amount on account of Mr. Powers and applied it to his own uses. The insolvent had also carried on business as a flour factor, and in that character owed Mr. Powvers 2001. for flour supplied.
M1r. Commissioner PurLirs said the insolvent had been g,uilty of a serious offence, for less than which many men had been transported. The insolvent had heen in custody s.ince December, and the iudgment would prolong his imi'risonment until May. He would be discharged in five calendar months from the vesting order.
EN RE HACKLEY FREDERICK WOOD.
This insolvent, an attornoy, applied to be discharged. Upon a former hearing he had been opposed by a laundress, to whom he owed 91., and the case was adjourned to enable some arrangement to be made with that creditor.
Mr. LEwIs, of Ely-place, to-day opposed, being a creditor for the costs of conducting the insolvent's business on a former application to this Court, and took an objection that tho insolvent had not described himself as of lVhitecross-street Prison, of which he was an inmate when he contracted tho debt with them (Messrs. Lewis and Lewis).
The insolvent's counsel admitted the description must be amended.
M1r. LF-%Is said he should not have taken the objection, had not the insolvent improperly stated that he had paid them large sums (200l1 or 3001.), when the fact was they had only received twoguineas for counsel's fees.
The laundressWs complaint having been withdrawn, the case was adjourned to amend the description, and the bail was enlarged until April 20.

The jury in the case of Edward Jackson indieted for having feloniously received a firkin of butter, kowng it to havo been stolen, being so divided in opinion that their agreeing to a verdict was next to impossible, the AssistantJudge, at 10 o'clock on Friday night, directed the Court to be adjourned until this (Saturday) morning at a quanter ast 9 o'clock, at which tiue they were bronght into court. hcy looked xhausted, and shevral of thome complained sorely of their haing been kept nearly 24 hours without refreshment.
The A smITAsT-JUJDo said he very much regretted that they had been unable to agree, and he had w;aited until 10 o'clock the prevnous night, hoping to prevent their being locked up until morning, should they come to a decision by that hour, but as they did not there was no alter. native
The foreman said there was not tho least possible ohance of their agreeing upon a verdict even were they locked up for a week. The only alteration that had taken place wrs that one who had been in the majority had gone over to the minority.
Mr. Lewis, jun., in the absenoe of counml,4id his client (tle prisoner) would consent to the jury being discharged, and the prosecutor, ho believed, bad no desire to havo the caFe retried; and probably, as thoprisoner had been under all the peril of the charge, the Court might sanction that course, as the late Mr. Sericant Adams did in a celebrated case tried before him, a course which would not be inoonsistent with the ends of justioe, particularly as there Wm great doubt on the nminds of sone of-the jurora, and they could not age. A
Tho AssSTAN T-JTuDGE thought that would not be a con. venient course in this case. If the jury were discharzed from gi,ing a verdict tho easo would pt4nd as it did before
the plisoner Was given in charge to the jury - in fact it would ba an untried cLse. He was sorry that the jury had bWen kept locked up all night, but even then he could not discharge them unless there were reasons to apprehend illness.
A Juror said he suffered from asthma, and he only go5 rehef by wrarmth and nursing, and longer detention without refreshment would be very dangerous to hit,. Two others complained of illness arising from exbaustion.
T0 ASMT&STiJUI)GY sent for a medical gentleman, Mr. Barringer, of St. Johu-street, who examined the three complaining jurors; and, having been sworn, he statd that, with respect to tvwo of them, be apprehended danger if they were kept longer wvithout refreshment.
The ASSISTAXT4T-JUDO thereupon ordered the jury to be dicharged, and. glad enough tlhey seemed. They at once left the court.
Mr. Lewis asked that the prisoner might be admitted to bWi.
The AsssTANT-.JUDGE declined to comply, and said the application could be made at Judges' Chambers.
The witnesses for the prosecution were then directed to attend on the bail-day of the adjourned sessions, and the Court adjourned.

CROWN COURT.-(Bef6re Mra. Justicc CROaIrP'Or.)
David Berry, aged 23, was indicted for having wornded Thomas Maugham at Bradford, on the 14th of November last, with intent to do him grievous bodily harm.
Mr. Blanshard and Mr. Shaw prosecuted; mr. Campbell Foster defended the prisoner.
It appeared that the prosecution was instituted by Ifr. Taylor, a millowner at Baildon, near Shipley, whoso worLman Thomas Maugham was. In hiss mill at Baildon xr. Taylor introduced an improved system of working his looms, called " the two-loom" system, under which one man was enabled to work two looms. Under the old system a man could only work one loom. The new system being calculated to throw a greatnumber of men out of employment was veryunpopularamong the workmen working in the mills about Shipleyvwhich is very near Baildon, and,in consequence of his niot lceg able to obtain workmn in Shipley who would work nmder the new system, Mr. Taylor was corn pelled to seek for labour three or four miles off in the neighbourhood of Manniughamand Bradford. This state of feelinghaving led to many collisions between his workpeople and the Shipley men Mr. Taylor closed his miUl at half-past 5 instead ot at a-quarter to 6, like the other millowners, that his men might be enabled to get out of the way before the other mills turned out their hands. On the 14th of November last, while this strong feeling was existing, Mr. Taylor closed his miU as usual, and the prosecutor and three other of his men were going together towards Manningham, followed by some other of his workmen, when they saw a body of 50 or 60 men in the road before them, armed with sticks and hedge stakes, who with loud threats at the " twoloomera" set upon them aud beat them unmercifully. The prosecutor endeavoured to get past them by clinging to the wall anud keeping his back towards them, but be was Inocked down and severely beaten about the head, which was cut in several places. He bled very much from his head, and was otherwise severely injured. The prisoner was one of the men who struck him. Ho could not recognize any of the others. After the crowd had dispersed the prosecutor was assisted home by some women, and was then taken to the Bradford Infirmary,where he remained under the doctor's hands seven weeks. At the expation of that time the prisoners and others were taken into custody, and the prisoner was identified by the prosecutor as one of the men who bad struck him. He was corroborated In this statement by two men named Smith and by a man named Blaydes, who were with him, and who EaW him struck, and were themselves struck by the prisoner. It was a fine frosty night, with a rising moon, and they were quite certain the prisoner was the man.
On cross-examination it was elicited that none of the wit. nesses except the prosecotorhad ever seen the prisoner before, and that the prosecutorhadonlyeeenhim onceortwiceinthe street. None of them ever gave any intormation against the prisoner for seven weeks-till the prosecutor came out of the infimary.
For the defence it was contended that the excitement of the affray and the insufficient light, coupled with the facts that the prisoner was before unknown to the witnezies, and had not been attempted to be identified until seven weeks after the event, rendered the proof that the prisoner was one of the persons present at the affray extremely unsatisfactory. In addition to this, it was attempted to be shown that he had been at home at his tea on the night and at the time in question, and could not therefore have been present. The witness called for this purpose, however, prevaricated much in his testimony.
Iis LoRDSuiIP having summed up the evidence,
The jury, after some consideration, found the prisoner GUilhl.
His LoRDSnllP, in pasdng sentence, said, the case was a most important one. It was not to be borne that workmen should band themeelves together, and by threats
menaces, and violence should interfere with the freedom of action of other workmen and masters who chose to work on a different system to that which they approved. In a manufacturing countrv like this such an offence was A moat serious one and not to be tolerated. The prosecutor had been most severely injured, and there could be no doubt that therisoner was one of the Rarties who had injured him w e acting and taking part an these outrageous and lawless proceedings. The sentence of the Court was that he ba imprasoned for 18 calendar months with hard labour.
CnaL CounT.-(Beforec Mr. Baron bA,iR£rr.)
WILKINSON V. REECE.
Mr. Overend, Q.C., and Mr. Hall appeared for the plaitiff; Mr. Enowles, Q.C., for the defendant.
It appeared that MIr. Leonard Wilkinson was the plaintiff and Mr. Charles Reece the defendant, and that they both resided at Bradford, the former being a cab proprietor and the latter a plumber and glazier. This was an action brought to recover the value of a horse which was kllled by the neglgence of the defendant's servant, and the defendant had paid 101. into court as being the full value of tho horse. The case of the plaintiff, however was that the animal was worth 301. In November last Join Micklethwaite, horsekeeper to the plaintiff, was riding the horse in question and leaing another in Manningham-lane, and, hearing a cart behind coming at a rapid pace, he drew the horses aside and having got the horse he was riding on to the footpath the other horse was struck by the wheel of the cart and knocked down. He was got up again, but after going 30 or 40 yards he dropped down dead. The sole question was as to the value of the horse, and during the hearing of the defendant's case a good deal of amusement was created. The evidence for the defendant went to show that the horso was at least 16 years old, that it wvas "rused up," and not worth 10h, and that, having been used as a cavalry horse at Hlarrogate, the animal reared and fell on his back, and that, not beig able to go through the mUitary evolutions for which it was hired, it vwa ordered off the field in disgrace.
The learned Counsel for the defendant gave a moat humourous account of the horse's history to the jury, which excited great laughter in court.
The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff-damages 51.
PAWSON V. BROMEIEAD.
Mr. Bill, Q.C., and Mr. Quain appeared for the plain. tiff; Mr. Monk for the defendant.
The plaintiff, Mr. Henry Pawson, it appeared, is a shorthand writer, and one of the proprietors of the Siweifekd Times, and the defendant,hMr. Bromehead,jun., isanattorney at Sheffield. The action was brought to recover 1031. Os, 3d., the sum charged for a transcript of shorthand notes; the defendant pleaded that he was never indebted except as to 711. 16g. 6d., which sum he had paid into court. It appeared that on the 12th of February, 1854, an investigation commenced at the Royal Hotel, Sheffield, before arbitrators, to determine upon a claim made by Mr. George Wright, whose property was interfered with by the Sheffield Waterworks Company in the construction of their works. Mr. Bromehead wasthe solicitor who acted for Mr. Wright, and, as the clain attracted considerable public attention, the plaintiff went to the meeting in order to obtain some authentic information for the purpose of his newspaper. The defendant on that occasion engaged the plaintiff to take a shorthand note, and a transcript had immediately to be made for the use of Mr. Wright's counsel. Mr. PWwson performed the work, and the arbitration extended over nine days, and he charged a guinea a-day and 9d. a folio for the transcript. The only question between the parties was, -whether 9d. or 6de. a folio ought to be charged, the plaintiff claiming 9d., but Mr. Bromehead said 6d. a folo was a proper charge for the transcript in question. A number of London shorthand writers and other skdlled witnesses were examined as to the reasonableness of the charges. The charge in London was said to be 8d. per folio, but in a small town like Sheffield, where there was less business of the kind to be done, 9d. per folio was said to be a reasonable cberge.
The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for the amount claimed.
SATURDAY, M.Aucn 14.
CROWN COURT.-(Before Mr. Justice CRO.MrTOr.)
John Hawley was charged with committing a burglary at North Dalton on the 13th of February in the dwellinghouse of Mr. Wiliam Binnington, a farmer, and stealing a large quantity of pllate.
M1r.C. Newton and Mr. W. S. Cross were for the prosecution ; and Mr. Dearsly for the prisoner.
It appeared that Mbr. Binnington, after looking round the house and seeing everything secure for the night, locked her dining-room door and went upstairs, taking the key with her. On the following morning it was discovered that the dining-room had been entered by the window, a large quantity of plate stolen, and the room entirely ransacked. The burglars had been drinking in the room, and footmarks of -two men were traced for several miles to a plantation, in which about a week afterwards nearly all the plate was found. The prisoner on some former occasion had caled at the house, and on the day of the robbery. had been seen with two other men about two miles from it. At 9 o'clock onthe following morning he was seen going intb Beverley, and at half-past 11 w,^as taken to the lock-up for being drunk and disorderly. On his person were found Mrs. Binrdngton's purse and four silver knife-resters, and the marks made by his boots were similar to those left by the burglars on the premises. For the prisoner it was contended that footmarles were insufficient evidence to convict on, and, as to the proer found on him, it had been received from some person by the prisoner without his being concerned in steimg it.
The prisoner was found Guilty, and sentenced to four years' penal seridgde.
(Beforc Mr. Rmnss, Q.C., in the Uagistrates' Roor.)
Jol Bmmerson was charged with robbing James Barrett on1the highway, at Horsforth, near Leeds, on the 21st of November last, of 141. 15s. Id., the property of Samuel Gr*y,and others.
4[r.3iddleton and Mr. Wheelhouse prosecu'ed.; 1r, BlimshaL defended the prisoner.
lle6sra Gray, it appeared, were woollen cloth manufac. turr,, and the managmg partner in the firm had been in thsabjt. of sending Barrett, a boy of 15 years old, on a Fa;ay, for the smal change necessary to pay the weeldy wage. On the day named the hov went for that purpose into the village of Horsfort, about toree quarters of amiile from themill, taleRngwithhim two5l.notes.Restartedonhisway bac k vith the money he had received in change .d.
41. 1s. ld. more, which he had also got in Horsfoitb, to take to the mill, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, car
with him at tho same time some groceries as we71as the money in a basket. When he had arrived at a lonely place in the road by the side of a wood the prisoner rushed out upon him, and after some altercation about another matter struck the boy twice, knocked him down and, asking him what he had ui the basket, put 6is hand under the lad's throat so as to prevent his shouting, and, kneeling upon him, took away from him the basket and its contents. With this the prisoner immediatelyjumped over the wall into the vood, and tho boy lost sight of him. He was, however, observed close to the spot by a man named Parker, who was on the road about 100 yards off, just before tho moment of the robbery. Parker and the boy had both been acquainted with the prisoner. After the loss Barrett made tho best of his way down to the mill calting on his road at a cottage and giving information.
hough the prisoner was searched for after the occurrence, he was not seen again in the village till he was apprehended at a place some few miles off. Some other Witnesses were also called, who proved that on the evening of the day tho prisoner was seen at the Fer. rand's Arms in Bingley, treating the company in that house, alleging that ho had won 15. by gambling.
31r. BLANSHARD, having addressed the jury. contending that it was not proved that any robbery had been committed, or, even if so, that the identity of the prisoner was not sufficently proved,
The jury immediately found tho prisoner Guilty, and he was sentenced to four years' penal servitude.
Joseph Eempshall, aged 21, was indicted for stea ing on tbe oth of January last, at Rotherham, a heifer valued at 201., the properby of Mr. John Jones, of Rans-kill Grange, near Blythe, ottinghamshire.
Mr. Campbell Foster prosecuted; the prisoner was undefended.
It appeared that the prosecutor was an extensive cattle dealer residing at Rans-kill Grange, near Blythe, and on the 4th of January last, being the day before Rotherham cattle fair, he sent seven fat heifers to Rotherham for sale. These were placed by his man, George Erane, in a field adjoining Rotherham, rented by the prosecutor, and the gate fostened, about 6 o'clock that afternoon. Next morning, on going to the field to feed the catte, he found the gate removed off the hinges, open, and all the cattle out of the field. Six of these he aftervards found on the high road at distances of a mile and two miles from Rotherham, the seventh hecould nowhere find, although he searched all day, and gave information of its loss. followin morning, which was on the Tuesday, a butcher named Eaton, living at Ashton-under-Line, from 30 to 40 miles from Rotherham, had a fat heifer offered him for sale by the prisoner, who wanted 211. for It. After looking at it, Eaton offered 151. 10s. for it, which the prisoner agreed to take. Eaton said he had not all the money in his pocket, but he would give him a sovereign then and go and get the rest. The prisoner told him to be quick, as he wished to go by the train to Manchster. Eaton, suspecting the animal had been stolen, from the lame state of its feet, and from the account the risoner gave of it, went direct to a constable, whom he broueht back with him, and then handed over to the prisoner 141. 1os., the balance of the price agreed upon for the heifer. The constable immediately took the prisoner into custody on suspicion of having stolen the animal. The prisoner denied this, and said he had got it from a man named Jackson at Sheffield, for whom he was to try to sell it for 181., and if ho could not sell it he was to drive it on to Manchester or Chester and meet him there, and he received 2s. 6d. from him for his trouble. Inquiries had been made for Jackson, but no such person had been found. The prosecutor said tho prisoner had formerly been in his service and gave him an excellent character; he had often tusted him with large sums. But the prisoner knew that he sent cattle to Rotherham-market and placed them in the field from which the one stolen had been taken.
After a careful summing up by his LoRDSnu
The jury found the prisoner Gutilty, with a recommendation of mercy on account of his previous character.
Be was sentenced to be imprisoned three calendarmonths. John Jarvis was charged with shooting at John Jackson, with intent to kill and murder him, at Sntton, on the 13th of November last.
Mr. Blanshard and Mr. Bower prosecuted; Mr. Shepherd defended the prisoner.
This charge arose out of a poaching transaction. The prosecutor it appeared acted as an occasional watcher on Colonel Crompton's preserves at Azerley-hall. Be and others of the colonel's gamekeepers were out oa this night and heard some shots in the direction of Piney-moorwood. From the number of shots fired it wa3 easily discovered that the poachers were a numerous band, and after obtaining as much assistance as they could the watchers entered the wood, when they aome in contact with five men, three armed with guns, the prisoner with a stick and a part of a hedge-rail, and the other with a stick only. In the first instance they attacked a man named Exelby, a watcher, and, threatening to shoot him if he did not tel how many watchers were in the neighbourhood, took him off towardis another part of the wood, as it were in custody. They shot some pheasants, and when they had arrived at a plue called the 'ude they suddenly eame upon the prosecutor and a man named Wilkinson. When this occurred the poachers dixvdcd their forces, the prisoner and two of his comrades attacking Wilkinson, while the fourth attacked the prosecutor. After some altercation the prisoner cauled out "Give the- a barrel," and, almost immediately afterwards another of the poachers stepped back, raised a gun to his shoulder, presented, and fired it directly at the prosecutor, who wasthen standingwithin10 orllyardsfromthe poaches. Providentially, however, although the cap exploded, the gun was not discharged, and the prosecutor dropped under a tree, and, making the best of his way into the thick part of the wood, escaped.
Mr. SnEERs D, in defence, called four witnesses to show that on the day of the occurrence, and for some days both before and after this event, the prisoner was at Darlington, and so could not be present on the occasion.
His LoRD:sy very carefully summed up the evidence, pointing out the bearing of the testimony on either side;
And the jury, after a long consultation, found the prisoner Guilty.
Be was sentenced to be imprisoned eight calendar months with hard labour.

UAC1}SON AIM OTHIRS V. JOHNSSON.
M1r. Atherton, Q.C., Mr. Digby Seymour, and Mr. Kerr appeared for the plaintifif; Mr. Knowles, Q.C., Mr. Hill Q.C., and Mr. Shaw for the defendant.
This was an action of trespass for breaking and entering the plaintiffs' shops in Wakefield, and seizing and taking away a large quantity of flour; to which the defendant plead " Not Guilty by statate."
The plaintiffs carry on business as millers at the Fleet Mills, near Wakefield, and also at King's ;Mills, and have a shop in Wrengate and Westgate, in Wakefield, for selling flour by retail. The defendant is inspector of nuisances under the Board of Health for that town. On the 25th of February the defendant thonght proper to seize some sam.ples of flour at the plaintiffs shop in Westgate, and on the sam e day some sacks of flour at their other shop in Wren ate. On the 26th he went with waggons and horses to bot hops, and carried away all their contents, amounting to upwards of 80 sacks of flour. He then lodged informations before the magistrates, charging the plaintiffs with exposing for sale unwholesome flour unfit for food. On the plaintiffs appearing before the magistrates some amateur chymists, cergymen and others, stated that in their opinion the flour was adulterated. The hearing was adjourned to
afford an opportunity to Professor Taylor and other chymists of eminence to analyze theflour ; which was done, and eventualyaU the informations were dismissed. Formerly the offncne of selling unwholesome food was prosecuted by indictment at the sessions, but that remedy being dilatory extraordinary powers Were vested by Act of Parliament in the zoards of Health. The defendant would, no doubt, rel,y upon the Nuisances Removal Act, 18th anda19th of Victoria, cap. l21, sec. 26, which authorizes the inspector to examine flour and other food, and, if found to be unwholesome, to seize the same. The plaintfs complained that their flour was seized without pervious examination, and their trade seriously damaged and impeded for some time.
The notice of action having been put in the following witnesses were examined:-
Wiliam Robinson Massey, the plaintiffs' shopman in Wrengate, proved the coming of the defendant to the shop on the 26th of February, 1856, andtaking samples of the flour. In the afternoon of the same day he returned with another man and a horse and cart, and said he wa come for the flour of which he had taken samples, and that he himself was his authority. He took all the flour then in the shop. Itwascommon and thirds flour. Next day defendant came again with the men that swept the street and a wherry, and took away, in three loads, al the flour then in the shop, being 46 sacks. This was of a better qiality than the flour taken away the day before. The nour was placed in an empty warehouse in Westeate. Witness sent for Mr. Jackson and returned to the shop, which he found closed, and the whole of the flour gone.
On cross-examination this witness admitted that the defendant had, previously to the seizure, complained that the flour smelt badly. The different sorts of flour were sold at different prices. Thirds was at this time sold as low as Is. 10d. per stone of 141b. It was generally sold for pigs, but people might use it for themselves. The price wasnot Lmarked upon that sort as it was Upon thebetter sorts.
eienry Lightfoot.-Was shopman t the plaintiffs at the Westgate shop. On the 25th of February, between 11 and 12 in the forenoon, the defendant came there, and said he had come to take the common flour and the thirds. Be waited till a cart came, and then took away a sack and a-half of thellourwithoutexa iningit. Nextmorning became with carts, and took away all the flour in the shop, being 40 sacks. It was taken to an empty house in Westgate.
Mfr. John Jackson exaamined,-I am one of the plaintffs, and father of the other plaintiffs, who are my partners. Besides our shops in Waefield, we have the Fleet MEis about six miles off, and lso King's Mills. We do an extensive business. The grain was purohased by myself or by one of my sons. Wehavecarried on theretailbusiness at the shop in Wakefield since 1854, bit have had similarestablishmeute in Leeds for 20 year No flour Is sold by us in Wakefield except what is gound by ourselves. Up to thetime of the seizure I heard no complaints of the unwbolesomeness of our flour at Wakefield-only as to the Ised to be at Wakefield on Fridays (themarket daysf, and then to visit our shops. I have issed an advertisement offering a reward for detecting bad flour. After the investigation by the ma. gistrates some of the bags which had been seized and re-
ned to us vwere examined by the Rev. Mr. Taylor, Mr. *Micklethwaite, and other gentlemen. One bag was forwarded to Professor Taylor for analysis.

(Beforc Mr. Justice ERLE and a Syccial Jury.)
LOVETT V. LoVErr.
This was an issue directed by the Court of Chancery to try the validity of certain testamentary papers executed by the late Miss Elizabeth Lovett, of Liscombe-house, Bucking' hamshire.
Mr. Serjeaut Byles, Mr. G. L. Russell (of the Chancery bar), Mr. D. Power, and Mr. D. Browne were counsel for the plaintiff; and Sir P. Thesiger, Mr. O'Malley, and Mr. D. D. Reane represented the defendant.
The cause occupied the Court four days, and a great mass of evidence was adduced on both sides, but the mate. rial facts on which the issue depended may be comprised in a comparatively brief statement.
It appears that the testatrix, Miss lovett, who traced her descent from Richard deLouvet, who accompanied William the Conqueror in 1066 to England, was, at the time of her death, which occurred on the 18th of Augast, 1855, seized in fee simple of an estate at Liscombe, in the parsh of Cholesburz, in the county of Backingham, and which estate had been mipossession oI the lovett family for upwards of 500 years. Its value is estimated at between 4,O01. and 5,0001 a-year. This lady was very proud of her ancestry, mndbeing anxious that the Liscombe estate should remam undivided, which it wouldnot have done had itbeen allowed to descend to ber coheiresses (there being no male heir), abe first devisea it to Jonathan Vaughan Lovett, the half. brother of the defendant, Robert Lovett, and to his son, Sackville Hamilton Lovett, in tail male. But both father and son dying in the lifetime of the testatrix, she turned her attention to the defendant, the Rev. Robert Bovett, and in 1847 made a testamentary disposition of the estate in his favour. The testatrix altered her will in 1849, and again in 1851,but by bothof thosewilisthe estate was still given to the defendant. On the 15th of May, 183, she executed another will, by which ahe devised the Liscombe property, not to the defendant in the first instance as in her former Will, but to he P itiff, Captain Phillips Cosby Lovett, of the mer5hant service, and to his son in tail male, and then to the defendant and his heis, thus postponing Robert, the defendant~, to Cosby, the plaints Oa tha 8th of October, 1853, she mnade another and her lawill, from which the name of Robert Lovett, the defendant, was omitted alto. gether. On the 16th of June, 1855, she e.xecuted a codicil, csrrying out her wiill of Octobcer 8, 1853. On the 18th of August, 1855, the testatrix died, leaving the plaintiff her sole devises. It then became necessary to prove the wtill; bult a caveat was entered by Mrs. .&shton Yates, one of the coheiresses of the testatrix, and the defendant. The Eccle siastical Court decreed in favour of the plaintiff, to whomn pSrobate was granted. The plaintiff then applied to the Court of Chancery, with a view of obtaining a decree to establsh the wills and codicil, the result of w ch apes. tion was the sending down of the present issue for the jury
o say whether the two wills and the codicilwere good testamentary dispositions of the Liscombe estate to the paintiff. The formal execution of the different instrument
bythetestatrix having been proved, Sir F. Thesiger, on behalf of the defendant, disputed their validity, on the ground that at the time of her executing them the faculties of the testatrix had become impaired by illness, and that sbe had been practised upon by a "woman," who had obtained complete control over her, and had dictated to her testasnentary dispositions which were inconsistent with her real inclinaiions. In support of this allegatiQn evidence was adduced to show that the testatrix was originally a person of very strong mind, and of a very determined and resolute ..l; that she was stately and dignified inhermanner, tather haughty, exacting respeet from her inferiors and de-
.endents, Impatient of contradiction, proud of her ancient leage, and, above all, a person of the greatest truth and honour, and utterly! incapable of any meanness or deception, but thtillness had prostrated herintelletand rendered her rapable of being unduly infuenced. The "woman" alluded to hy Sir B. Thesiger was Miss Marianne Lovett, a daughter cfJonathan Lovettf mentloned in the will of 1847, an who died in 1849. She was third cousin of the testatrix, and second cousin of the plaintiff. This young lady lived with he testatrix, andwas dependentupcon her, and, according tothe testimony of the defendant's witnesses, her conduct a' first was very respectful and deferential towards her bene. factress, but that, when the mind of the testatrix had be. come weakened by severe i11ness, Miss Marianne totally ihanged her conduct tovwards her ana assumed entire domi. nion over her. Several of the witnessesmentioned instances inwhichthey considered this dominion and controlling power of Marianne to have been exercised, but that youn
Icdy when giving her evidence denied ever having attempted to unduly influence her cousin in regard to the disposition of ,her property, and sid that the only occasion on which she ever ventured to make P suggestion was when liss Lovett said to her, " I do not think I will leave anything to lour married msiter," whereupon lMarianne said. " You have always led her to believe you would. Don't maLe any alteration; leave it as it is." The introduction of the Llamtiff, Cosby Lovett, who was a total stranger to the thetactrix vwas also attributed by thls defendant to the acEve interference ef Miss arianne Lovett, but shepositively swore that she ha never spoken to Miss Lovett about Cosby Lovett, nor had she ever spoken to her in any way to make her alter her mind in respect to the disposition of her property. By way of showing that the mind ef the testatr3x, though not utterly prostrate, waz of a wavering and fuctuating capacity, letters written by her obout the timeo when the name of Coeby Lovett was substituted for that of Robert Lovett as her devises were pro. duced, one of which, addressed to Mr. Randall, her soi

It was endeovoured to account for this strange document by I howing that a debate had taken place in the House of Cor. maona on the mnbiect of the Successiont Duties a few days before the letter was written, in which allusion was made to Mr. Pitk -who had Abandoned an Attempt to impose a similar -taxs and that that debate had been read to the tes. tatrix.

. Justice Williams opened the commission here yesterday afternoon, and then 'went to church. This morning the business commenced, the Lord Chief Justice sitting at Nisi Prius and Mr. Justice Williams presiding in the Crown Court. The business here was very light. In the Civil Coumt there were but three cascs,-one an undefended ejectment, the second an interpleader case to try to whom certain goods belonged, and the third an action for goods sold.
3;1T V. rAPR.
Mr. Cole was comnsel for the plaintiff; and Mr. Karslake for the defendant.
This was an issue to try to whom certain goods belonged. The plaintiff was the dbnghter of a poor man who had been for ma-ny years in posEession of a cottage which in truth belonged to his family under a wilL An action was brought againat lEent, and Parr, who was an attorney, was employed by Kent to defend hbis case. Daring the progress of the proceedings Parr settled the action by agreeing to take 201., Kent to give up a little bit of land adjoining the cottage. Parr then sent in a bill of costs to Kent for 691. for defending the action, but, giving credit for the 201., the claim was reduced to 49& Parr proceeded to recover the amount, and obtained ajudgment, upon which Kentassigned his household furniture and horse and cart and plough to his dauihter, who was a dressmaker, for the sunm of 211. l2s., at whicn theywere valued, and it was alleged that this sum she had paid to her father. She lived -with her father, and the goo=sremained in the house as before. A great deal of extraneous matter was introduced in the cause. The plaintiff swore qositively that she had paid the money to her father, whch money she had s2ved up from her earnings.
The defence was that this was not a bond .fdc sale and purchase, but was a colourable transaction, with an intent to defraud Mr. Parr.
The jury found that it was a fraud-verdict for the defendant for all the property, except as to a clock valued at
CROWN COURT.
In this Court there were 23 prisoners for trial, As appeared by the calendar, but the cbhrges were not of a serious nature. Two boys, however, whose case did not appear were chargedupon the coroner's inquest with manslanghter, for having caused the death of another youth by giving him a strong opiate instead of a black draught, but the grand jury ignored the bill.
Mr. Justice Wnrawrs, in charging th rrandl jry, said that, although numerically speaking, the endar presented rather a formidable appearance, there being 23 names in the printed list, ye upon a closer inspection it afforded a subject much more for congratulation than for condolence. There was one serious case of rape, and two or three cases of burglary and housbrealkig, but they were by no means of a grave character, and the remaining cases might have been disposed of at the quarter sessions, had they intervened. It gave him great pleasure to find there wvere no cases of robbery or burglary accompanied with violence, and in all the cases they would find a total absence of that atrocity which had of late so fearfully markAed the calendars incm le of the towns which they had visited. He had read the depositions, and found nothing wvorthy of any remark.

BOW-STEnr3.-A well-dressed young Frenchman, who gave the name of Joseph Petit, has been remanded by Mr. JARDILE on Eeveral charges of robbery at different hotelc.
The prisoner, representing himself as a foreign gentleman at present engaged in Europn travels, applied for apartments at the Bedford Hotel in Covent-garden, on the 5th inst, and was at once conducted to a bedroom. The next morning Mr. Wodehouse, a gentleman occupying the adjining apartment, missed a valuable dressing-case, containing, boides the ual Articles, several 5& Barik of England notes and a 10l-note. The fashionable foreigner was at once suspected, but no trace of him could be found. It was afterwards ascertained, however, that the prisoner went direct to the Exeter Hotel on the 6th, and engaged a bedroom there in a similar way. He requested to " see his room,' it bing then about 1 oclock m the daytime, and before 2 o'clock ho had managed to get out of the house with about 301. worth of jewelry belonging to the landlady, Mrs. HavelL Information was given to the police, and on the l1th inst. Ser.eant Gnmmer, of the C division, sue-
eded in gettnge ome trace of the prisoner, who was finall apprehended at Stevens's Iotl, in Bondstreet. he srgeant obtained access to the room of which the prlsoner had taken possession, and during his temporary absence examined the prisoner's travelling-bag. It was found to contain a couple of cleverly constructed "jemmies" of a peculiar form and foreign manufacture, and Also a handsome stiletto. The prisoner returned home at about 1 o'lock in the morning, and was taken into custody irmediately on entering the hotel. He denied that either the jemmies or the stiletto wore his property
Witnesses from other hotels and several gentlemen attended to identify the prisoner, a task of some difficulty, owing to the complete change his face had undergone; tbe arrangement, quantity, and colour of his whiskers being ap. parently changed at each place. The features, however, were easily recognized.
The officers found five 5L-notes, besides a quantity of jowrelz (chiefly rings), upon the prisoner. F our of the notes were identified by Mr. Wodehouse, and the other property it was expected would all be identified. The prisoner bad carried on this system of plunder with considerable
The prLsoner, who affected ignorance of the English language, and spoke through an iterpreter, said he required an Advocate,
He will be re-amined on Thursday next.
XAmynomx-Willi&m Webb, al=s Levy, the man charged with attempting to murder Mr. Alfred Buckler, by stabbing him with a butcher's dressing knife in a railway carriage on the North London Railway, was broughtup for re-exammation before Mr. LoNG.
Mr. Buckler, the person wounded, was in_attendance; he bad his left arm in a sling, and on the left side of his neck be had a plaister nd bandage, covering the wound which had been inflicted on him by the prisoner. The evidence taken on the 6th inst. having been read,
Mr. Buckler was sworn-He said he was casistant to Mlr. Hollick, draper, of High-street, Poplar. At a quarter o 8 o'lock on the evening of the 5th inst. he got into a Camden-town train at Stepney station. He was in a secondclass carriage, and was proceeding to the Hampstead-roadstation, intending to meet a friend at the Colosseum. On reaching the Camden-road station all tho passengersalighted
leavinghiin in the carriage by himself,-this was about 23 minutes past 8 o'clock. As the trsiu was about to start he saw prisoner look into the carriage. He then opened the door and took his seat opposite to him. The moment thetramnwas in motion prisoner asked him which
was t'henext tahtion, andhbe rep lied, "Hampstead-road."
1risonersid, ,That's right," anzd moved closer towards him saying, "Is about half-past 8, isn't it? What is reay the c2e" Witness took out his watch, and told prisoner It was 25 minutes past 8, and then turned his
to look out of the window. At that moment he felt himself struck a violent blow on the neck, but he did not know with what, and, as he was turning, ho was struck by theprisoner onthearm inthesamemauner. Witness' umped up and sprang upon the prisoner; and, after a struggle, Lhad nearly overpowerEd him, when he saw a knife (the one produced) grasued in his left hand, and felt that he was woundeL he nevertheless succeeded in pushing him into the corner, and with one hand grasped the wrist of the hand which held the knife, and with the other his throat, at the same time screaming out " Murder !" By this time the train had almost stopped, and as soon as it did the guard opened the door, and witness then .aid-"Tms man has sabbed me," and the blood was flowing fast from my wounds. The prisoner remarked TIt'snotme. Hetriedtostab me. Itooktheknife away from himi,and, in self-defence,stabbed him." At this tme theknife was in boththeir handstheprisoner hvin hold of the handle, and wituess of the blade, by which hisngers -were cut.
In answer to the magitra tehe witness stated that it was utterly false thate hehad gsch a knife in his pos. session, or attempted to stab the prisoner. After being in the xtationhouse some time, and medically attended, he was sent back to his residence by a special train.
MIr. obertson, & surgeon of Poplar, proved attending r. Buckler, and the character of the wounds. Forfouror wound was within a igt of aninh f the carotid art,wshitch, if it had been wounded, would have caused

Coimpdlants had been made to mhim of its state oZ passengers travelling by this vehicle and, by order of tha Cominissioners of Police, he served 'a notice upon the defendants prohibiting their using it while in such a condition, but they nevertheless continued to do eo, and he had himself seen it thr eimeoused sO sineethn, and in consequenco followed uptho prohibition by a sum mons. The second omnibina, a2ew North-road one,was In a similar state of dilapidation, and as, like in the other case, the owners still kept running it aftr notice had been served upon them, the Commissoners considered it imperative that thig also should be followed uip by a summons.

BLECTION INTELLIGEINCE.
AYLesBuIRY.-A Conservative candidate has appeared-a Mr. T. T. Bernard, of Winchenden Priory, who bases his claims chiefly on local grounds. The two present members have also issued addresses soliciting re-election. Sir R. Bethell says:-
"Amajority, theresnlt of the combination of discdant pprties, having oompelled Lord Palmerston to adopt one of two alternatives, either to resign the government of the country into tho hands of a coalition formed of the Tory Opposition and those meenbers of a late AdmiUistration wheSo condluct during the Russian war was so genezaly censored, or to resect to the constitutional eourse of apMeaUng to the people, he has chowen the latter; and it has given the people of Enigiand, At A moAt opportune time, the power of determining what shall be the character of the next House of Commons atd the prinesples that ought to guide the Government of the coluntry. I trust that .ou and the other consaituencies will elect men who are earnest and . tincere sapporters of a Liberal policy. In the next Parliament great end isopertant subjects must be dealt with." 1.fr. Layard says,-
I shall give my eareost smpport to the maistry which identifies itself with such lberal measures as are miost conducive to the progress nnd welfare of the people. I voted for Mr. Cobden's motioa becuste I beheve the war witi China, uPon rwhich we have eatered, not only to have been oommaenoed upon inadequate grounds, hot to have been based upon transactions which Pa.liament could not with justice approve. I recorded my vote as a protest against a doctriee which appears to be sanctioned by oar policy in aU parts of the Eart. but which I believe to be as repugnant to morality as it is to good policythe doctrine that, in dealing with lastern nations, we are not bound by the game lawa of right and wrong that govern the relations of Christian States I am confildent that the decision of the House of Commons WYil tend to raise the character of this comutry sad that the time will come when the people of England 'wiU unanimously admit that those to whom they confided their honour and fair fame faithfully discharged the trust reposed in them. While thus protesting against the origin of the war, I shall be ready to give the Gorrfnment my best support in tahing such measures as may bo necessary to bring it to a conclusion consistent with the honour and true interests of this country. I need only refer to the votes which I have given during the time I have been in Prliament, to repel, as far as I am concerned, the unfounded charge that the mea50rity, on Ir. Cobdeu!s motion, was the result of a coalition or conspiracy for the purpose of upsetting the present Government. I trust that this unfortunate war may soon be brought to an honourable con'elusion, and the Homse of Commora may be able to devote its exclusive attention to the mPeans of diminishing taxation, which now weighs heavily upon tho Industrial class, and to the pausing of meamires OfpUblnc utility, and of Parliamentary and administrative reYorm. But, in order fully toaecuro the blesings of peace, I amnot opinion that the House of COmmons should exercige a more direct control over our foreign policy, and over the power enjoyed by Ministers of involving the country In a war without the consent or Inowledge of Pariament.
BARNSTAPLE.-Mr. Buck retires from the borough to contest the seat for the county (Northern division), which his father vacates. Mr. James Taylor, jun., of Birmingham, the originator of freehold land societies, who describes himself as "a working man and a teetotaUer," has offered himself as the exponent of advanced Liberal opinions.

BATH.-Sir Arthur lallam Elton, of Clevedon-court, Righ Sheriff of Somersetshire has accepted the invitation -of the Bath Liberals to come iorward as a candidate for the -seat for that city, about to be vacated by the rotirement of -Captain Scobell into private life. In the course of Friday afternoon Sir Arthur met the members of the Liberal Association and gave a brief exposition of his political Views; and to-day he is to address a public meeting of the electors in company with Mr. Tite. A curious address has been issued by Sir John Hare, which has excited attention only from ita eccentricity. The Conservatives are bestirring themselves and propose to bring forward Mr. Arthur Way, of Ashton-lodge, uncle of r. Creville Smyth, of Ashtoncourt. A meeting is to be held this (Monday) evening for the purpose of taking measures for securing Mr. Way's return, 'lhe extreme Radical party, iwho are dissatisfied with Mr. Tite, and also with the choice of Sir Arthur Elton, talk of nominatin,g Mr. Henry Vincent, of Chartist notoriety.

BODmILN.-Mr. James' Wyld, 'who formerly represented this borough inx Parliament, has issued his address tothe electors, and announced his intention of immediately commnencing his canvass. In the latter he atates that he conaiders that
"The dissolution of Parliament has bean hastened by a vote of the House of Commons, adversely to Her Majesty's Government, achieved by a strange combination of individuals vho have used the dijfculties with the Chinese people as a pretext for endeavouring to supplant the Adminiatration of Lord Palmerston, and for obtaining the control of the Government of the country. The political, personal, and commercial relattons of the English nation exist with every people and in every clme, aud a bold but just poucy Is neoessary for Great Britain, to preserve her world-encircling posseesions from menace, her citizens from insult, and her commerec from interruplion; and, while I am opposed to the unnecessary employment of naval er mlutary force, I would not permit any nation or people upon the face of the earth to offer an insult to our national flag. Should I, therefore, be honoured by a seat in the ensuing ParUament it will be my duty to give an honest but independent support tn the Government over which Lord Palmer3ton so honourably and ably presides.
BRIG}ITON.-An influential meeting of the supporters of Admiral Sir G. B. Pechell took place on Friday, at which he was present, when a resolution in favour of his return was unanimously carried.

Hervey, the other representative, was also held the same day for the purpose of hearing his Lordship's explanations respecting his conduct in Parliament, and more particularly in reference to his vote in the majority against Sovernment on the Chinese question. Mr. E. S. Creasy, barrister, finding that Mr. Coningham was in the field before him, and prepared to maintain the present contest on Liberal principIes, has announced his intention of withdrawing from this election. Mr. Coningham is now the only candidate in opposition to Lord A. Hervey, as Sir G. B. PecheD's rewelection msay be regarded as almost certain. A public meeting will take place this (Msonday) evening, at which Mr. Coningham will address the electors. Professor Creasy is also expected to ho present in support of Mr. Coningham's
BURTON-o-TREMT.-The Burton Wea'yNewlVs says that a meeting of the electors of the Northern Division of Stafford was held in the Town.hall of Burton-upon-Trent on Friday; Sir 0. Mosley in the chair.

Mr. Worthington, jun., Mr. Bloor, Mr. Bass, M.P., Mr. Worthington, Mr. Salt, the Rev. IL Day, Mr. Gretton, and others took part in the proceedings. MAen of all parties expressed their displeasure at the combined attack on Lord Palmerston, and their unanimous resolution to support him. Sir 0. Moseley, in a stirring speech, declared emphatically that he would support no candidate at the ensuing election who was not an earnest supporter of Lord 31almerston'*s Government.
CALsNB.-Major-General Sir W. F. Williams of Kar, las issued an address to the electors, solicitisig the honour of representing them in Parliament. No opposition is expected. The gallant baronet writes :_
" Izn doing so, I trust that. uuti I shall have the pleasure of meeting you, I have sufficiently explained from my seat in Parliament my reason for giving my cordial suppor to Hier Majesty's Government on the Chinese quest:on Had circumstances permitted the diecussion of the events connected with the Persian war, I shouid, with an equal sense of justice, have offered to the House of Commons my humble opinion in favour of that war as wenl as my congratuiaticos on its happy termination. These eastern qucsions, together with other subjects, which I Pledged myself at my first election to make the espa. cial objects of my study, 1 will more fully disaws when I shall have the honour of presentlng myself beforo you at Caine, and I trast that the result of this appeal wil mark your approbation of my conduct in a
ield which recent eveats in Parliament have rendered so circum. scribed.'

, I voted for Lord Palmerston's Government on the question reatingto the difficultiesatCanton becauso I believe the livesof British subject9, the Interests of British commerce, and the honour of the Bxitish flag would be placed in peril by the success of Mr. Cobden's mnotion.d
GATESHEAD.-Mr. Hutt, M.P., has issued an address to his constituents offering himself for re-election. He Eays:-
" Being of opiaion that in regard to the recent European war the present Prime Mlinister deserveed we of his country, and that his conduce, in some of the critical scenes through which we then paed, presented an honourable contrast to that of the leading men now combined for hias overthrow, I have supported him against their attacks. I trust that in doing so I have not unnmeetly represented the sentiments of Gateshead. Without designing to give to Lord Palmerston any indiscriminate adhesion, I desire to afford him in our domestic affais a free scope for that statesmanship which has signalizedhim iuoar external relations. HeJ4, I think, entitled to that trial; and I feel a deep-ceated distrust of those public men who must succeed to office In the event of Lord Palmersten's falL"

GLOCESTER (CrrY).-A Conservative candidate has at length appeared in the person of Sir Robert Walter Carden, alderman and magistrate of London, whose address to the electors was issued on Saturday. In it he says,-
" I am a Conservative in p,rticiple, a member of the Church of England, and a supporter of her institutions. I am at the samo time an advocate for civil and religious liberty, anddisposedto grant to all what I claim for myself-entire liberty of conscience. No poltical event has probably occasioned such differenco of feeliog as the recent vote on the China question. In my opinion, the unneces sary slaughter of the defenceleas Chinese barbarlans was a mistake, and ought not tohave been resorted to in order to compel the fulilment of treaties unwisely permitted to remain dormant for so many years, and that Lord Pal. mcerbton was in error In so flly endorsing the utterly indefensible acta of Sir J. Bowring. It may be a question hereafter Wheth-r some steps should not be taken to prevent the nation being involved In wars without the knowledge and sanction of P arliament. The incometax La so inquisitorial in Its nature, and from its mode of collection lable to sach great abuse, that In my judgment It ought only to be levied hi time of war, and certainly ought not to be continued after April,18i0. Thismaybeeffected by afirm, peaceful, andooneiliatory foreign policy, a carreful revision of oar taxation, and real economy m our establiehmente and expeudituro. From the experience I have derived during the time I served the Office of sheriff and magistrate of London, I am esatisfied that our efforts ought to be more strenuously devoted to the consideration and improvement of the condition of the worling and industrious olasses of the people. It is a subject which has for a long time occupied my attention, and it is a labour of love which I should checrfully unite with you in bringing to a state of practical utiiity in the city."
There was a meeting of Sir R. W. Cazden's friends on Friday evening, and he was very favourably received.
HAMPrsirusu.-Lord Henry Cholmondeley offers himself for re-election in the southern division, and his colleague, MIr. H. C. Compton, who hasrepresentedthis divisionforupwards of 22 years, retires.

wth a requisition presented to himn some time since. Mr. Beach IS a Conservative. The retiring Speak-er, Mr. Shaw Lefcvre, who has sat for the county 26 years, has published his farewell address to the electors.
HIShTS (bgOsvig).-Mr. Beach, of Oakiey-hill, " a Conservative, a cordial supporter of the agricultural interest, an uncompromising Protestant, supporter of any Governlment in nmaintainingthe honour of the British flag opposed to the late discreditab,le coalition of parties to dispiace the present Government," is a candidate for the suffragbes of the electors of this division of the county of Hants.
HAsvS (SOU-rsi).-Mr. Compton retires; Lord Henry Colm on deley offers him self for re -election . Th e H on. Ralph Dutton, of Tibni8bury manor, near Ramsey, deputy. chairman of the South-western Railway Company, offers hunself for election, and in his address, after touching upon commercial and social affairs, says-
"With reference to foreign politics I feel great regret that the Euro;>eanwr hbas been euc-eeded by an unforeseen conflict with the Chinese, butt s hould be unwvorthy of the high position of your representative Uf upon this or any other occsion I entertained a doubt wvhether the honour of the British flag wvereto be maintained or the national interests made subservient to party purposes. As the country is still sffering from theheavy drain upon its resources, eansedhythe. mnprepared st5st in which it entered upon the late wrar I consider thatitlis atpresent pirtleularly the duty of Parliament to exercise the mort vigilant control over the public expenditutre, but that at the same timee It would be inuduicious to withhold any supplies which msy be requisite for the efficiency of our defensive establishments, messa especially of that to whish thhs country is indebted for its national integrdty fromu foreign dominion and itS8 maritime supremacy, upon wrhich beth its safety and peace depend."
HABRWICII.-Mr. David Walddinglon has announceed his intention of retiring from the representation of this boroughs which he has represented since 1852. Three candidates are in the field-Mr. Bagshaw (the present member)

HUnDERSFIELI~ThO Reformers of Huadderefteld have not yet decded on a caudida,e. The elaims of Mr. Cobden, hmr. Akroyd, of rhalifas, and Mrr. Foster (the Libera candidate for Leeds) are under consideration, and most hikely one of these gentlemen will be put in nomination,
hriswie c t.-ir, Manshman, well know n as " The Friend of India" and for his extensive knowledge of Indian af'airs,
has isseed the following address. He stands in eonjunetion with Mr. Awdair, the present Liberal member:-
ChI will not attempt to eonceal from you thib a igreat porton or ry lie has been passed in Insda, hat my occupations there constrained me tohmake the progres of henets in Engined the bubject of constate study, and I flatter mysele that the habit of ronteyuplatAng the trant. actionsuofthe lastt20years fromai avourable distanes , acnd reed rom them ists ot party liUl not be considered a daqnalif catloefor thei tinmeintodhich eamunow aspiring. On such occasaony teeswhhsy be for the cfadidate to announce hi poUteial creed. But lso hmany of the vitl questons on vrhich the great pasties in the Slate were once divided have boen doapnred of that it ime no eas matter to discover the distinguishing lines of policy en which these partes nowr ahke their stand. In these remtanced I prpopos to offe* you my owtntvieson whatarppearto befthe current questionsof theday. I am for the extension of the sua ge. The elective frTnchise being a trust and not a property, ought to be bestowved on alil those now excluded from the enjoyment of It, who tay be expected to use it
r this sense of responsibiity, and to be withheld as far ao poHssble from those who value It onl for what it ow feteh In the election market We Owte It to,or national position to vindicate te mrost imPOrtant Institution inthis free ceuntrr(rom the imputation of resting on a basis of corruption. I question whether lo.ering the standard of qualification would give us a more inderefdent con. sttency, eras moe dignified House of Commons. Thebalit o . is obde
a question of the day. The ballot cannot be eaid to be open to the popular objection of being un-EngleIh or ungentaemally. it is constantly resorted to by Englsh gentlemen for their own protection in cases of election to their own asociations. If it be necessary for the strong, it muit be stiU more o for the weaC. Though it may not cure bribery, it may extingulsh intimidation, and whatever tends to purify our representative system ought to be tried. At the same time, I think there are other meares which moay effect the same object without that constitutional risk whicb some profess to see in the ballot. I am, therefore, fuUy prepared to vote for It, though I confess I should prefer seeing other remedies tried in the fret instanoe. The eoclesiatlscalcosla have long been condemned by the universal indignation of oclety, and It only remains for Parliament to give effect to Dublic opinion by passing the sentence of execution. Maynooth is another question on which a candidate Is likely to be catechized by some constitueniees. I am conscientionsly opposed to secular establishments of religion, and the grant to klaynooth oomeawithin this category. As a question of reigious Pollcy, there can, therefore, be no hesitation. But the grant is said to be an act of simple justice to those fromwbom an inoome of 30 times the amount has been withdrawn for the support ot another creed. How far this claim may be said to overrule other cqlderatlensIs a question ot some delicacy, and I am prepred tolotow tho comsowhiich is adopted by 8o many others, and give effe * jthe general wishes of the constituency. On the question of ch 'IC'w$e. however, theri can be no such difficulty. The slo0u'r this so rreowerpetualirrit tion Is extinguished thebetter for the interests of eion aud ocial harsoony.

The Immediate occasio of the present election arime out of recent events' In China, and a new qiuestion has thus beeni brought under dizscussion. The Ministry hoa be~en placed in a minority on that question, and it has been referred, to the arbitrationL of the country. HAving resided manry years In the East, aad acquired some knowledge of the character of Orientale, I cannot heaitate toasy that the collidionwhichlhastaken piece Ink China was inevitable. &t Cantin we were brought In contact with a ruthtless and inslent Tartar Viceroy, intent on hLumbling these whoma the Chinese are accustomed to designate the I outside barbarIans. Ind the course of two years he has executed 70,000 men, gaulty, for the most part, only of being aug. peted of favouring the insurent cause. He has repeatedly inuolted our flag, and trampled on our treaty rights. It became uoo&,ay, for the preservation of our Tast and increasing commnerce at that port, to ctheck this course of aggresion, whicha evey fshinstance of subesla slon only serves to aggravate. The Eritish Rtepresentative in China-the former secretary of the Peace Society In England -was suddenly called to act In a difficult emergency, and after his demand of flparation for a fresh insult had been evaded with Chinese duplicity and arrogance, he felt himself onastrained to resort to force. In the East on such occasons any ap. pewranoe of hesitationt and tImidity only serves; to beget premmlption and ia sure to end in tire maost faita consequences The wisest as we
as the most humane policy is that which exhibits energy at the corn. menoemrent. In these circumstances It Is difftcult to see what other cours Lord P'almenseon could have Dursued in accrdance with the dictates of sotund policy, and in jostles to our political naval and commercial authorities in China, than to give them the full support of Government. To have Paalyzed their efforta in the presenceoftanuInsolent and overbearing foe would most serionsly have compromised British intereets in China, and Probably led to the erpulsion of our merchants from ill the other ports In that empire. if the present election Is to be Influenced by the question of sustatining Lord Palmerston's policy, or expellig him from office, it would be an art of Ingratitude to forget that he has nobly maintained the dignity and Interests of England throuighout Europe during the late arduous struggle, and that he t,)ok charge of the vessel of the State when it was among the breakers, and conducted it safely Into port. He is not les entitled to our confidence in thaepresnt crisis, and I have no doubt thnat if our afrairs in China, continue to be Intrusted to his direction they will be managed wlth the same regard to the honour of England, and be brought to the same auspicious Issue."

LANCASHIRE NORTH).-At a numerous meetinig of libe-ral electors held at the Red Lion Hotel, Preston, on Wednesday, a resolution proposed by Sir J. P. KayShuttlewortb, and seconded by Mr. Jonatbhan Peel, was passd, tendering the thanks of the meeting to Mr. Hey. wood, on his retirement from the representation of the nort'hernx division of Lancashire, for his past services andI for the efficient manner in which he had discharged his Parliamentary duties. Colonel Wilson Pattn's urbsnity and courtesy as a member of Partiament were also approved in the same manner; and it was then resolved that Lord Cavendish, the eldest sonx of the 'Earl of Burlington, should be invited to offer himself as a candidate.

atteensuig election for thi borough, Mrx. Forster has declined to bcome a candidate, being unwilling to devide the Liberal party, many:of whom wished to have Mr. F. Carbutt, of Leeds, as their candidate. It is not certain that Mrx. Carbutt, seeing that his friends were out voted at the meeting on Friday night, wfil be the second Liberal candidate; and it is surmised that some more Dpopul man may be induced to become a candidate with th Hon. M. T. Baines. The names of Sir John Ramaden, hEr, S. Morley, and Mr. Layard have been muentioned,
LEIdlsMTns,-As already reported, the friends of Messr.

Among the 200 raquisitionis-tz are the names of the principal manufaLctuxrer, the Church clerg, the Dissenting ministers several magistrates, and a considerable contribution of the names of leading Conservatives, who will give their support to Mr. Harris on the ground of his being a townsman, of their respect for his personial character, and their knowledge of his thorough adhesion to Lord Palmerston's Administration.

MARLolnOouGIL-Lord Ermest Brace has issued the fol. lowing address:-
"1It having been annumcedby the First Mfinister of the Crown that Her Majesty,ini rho undoubted exercise of her prerogtive, willTery tbostly dissolve the present Parliament, I again seek a renewal at your bands of that trust which you have so generously confided torus for a period of nearly 251 year. I appear before you as a supPorter of L-Ord Palmerston. and I do not hesitate to Identify myEelf witth the genieral policy of that noble Lord ever since he has been placeed at the head of Her Mlajesty's Govemmeat.I can never forget that Lrd P&aievston under-tookthe Adminitration of this country at a moment when thae difficulties were so great that every other leading statecrman shrunk, from doing so; that he carried the war in which we were then engaed with Rumssiate a oecessul and a glorious termuination; andthat In conjunction with Lord Clacendon he finally obtained fornug in the conferences atPariaevery pototforwirich we conteuded.

The reoent financial, proposals of the Chanx. ceollr of the Xxchecquer have, I believe, upon the whole, given general satisfaction. The immediate remisson of more thanbalf the incometax mulst be a great boon to the commnniity, and the arrangementt which has now been made respeting a reduction in the tea duties will, I trust, heoeaimarsctory to the dealer, as well as a considerable relief to the consumer. The estimates appear to have been framed with every possible regard to economy consisent with the public safety, and I should much regret to see any further reduction to our army and navy attempted at present, after the experience we have so recently had of the danger of being totally unprepared for action, the knowledge of which fact by other nations probably led to the original aggression, and was undoubtedly thae cauro of gret embarras uneut. Whrie I hare Toted through life for the relief of alt classe of Dissenters,without dis;tinction, from anky political disabilities under which they have suffered, I yield to no mant in warm attachment to the established church of which I am a member, but I think it essetial to its safely and security in the affections of the people of this country; that, alowing a wide margin for differecues of opinion on minor points, it should In its doctrines mnaintain a thoroughly Prvotestant chwarater. - With regard to local matters I shal continue to take the same lively interest in your welfare which I have ever doens and, as I understand that it in your general opinonx that Improved railway communi cation with the metropolis and other Pasts of the united kingdom Wil be a gret benefit to the town, I shall do everything that lies in my Power to assist in your wishes."

The Steam Troop Ships.
SEX STBAf TROOP SHIPS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Is there any cure for the proverbially rickety condition of Her Majestys steam transports; or must the evil rather than the clxss of vessels go on improving?
I do not profess to be a regular licensed salt-water doctor, and most certainly, neither as Hoentiate nor quack, should I propose to meddle with such hopeless patients as ihe " Transits," "Urgents." But, though not a sailor, I have passed a good de.l of my time on the ocean, and I suppose if a man who has signed himself as being on the " look out" for illurtions of bad management i a publc de Rritent knows, or tbinks be knows, the origo malorum, leis bound to stte it. If wrong, let others who know better point out where; the subject is sarely importnt enough to deserve -entilation.
with xll due deference I believe the mischief has arisen from two exuSea :-first, many of the vessels used for tais particula service were never built expressly for it, and are sbips wbich bave proved defective for the more regular purposes of naval warfare; their defects having been orginally too great immersion when their intended arma. ment was got in, and too little speed for safety in the present state of the steam marine of other Powers. These repudiated war ships form the very worst class of all for the conveyanee of troops; they are of a verv strong, eumbrous build, and strain their engines fearfully in a heavy sea. Moreover, if during a war tho ocan as well as the land were likely to be the scene of conflict it would not be very politic to risk a regiment in one of these crawlers, armed en nfle Secondly, of the remainder, which have been constructed more recently with an eye to the transport service, too great strength is stiU insisted on, and the result is the same as that brought about by the Admiralty regulations respecting the mail steamers of various companies, I remember some years since crossing the Atlantic 1D one of the West India Mail fleete commanded by an officer of the Royal Navy, and with one of the most distinguished and mtelligent offcers of the same serviec as passenger. Both these gentlemen ajrecd that the gale which then crippled our er es would have had no sach effect on a lighter craft, built as such a vesel should have been, purely or sp2ed, and both were also of opinion thst the objectprofessedlysought by "My Lords,"namelTthe power of ecrying. uns In case of war, was not attained, for the troade, frons herself, would shake the ship to pieces Thus, then, as now, an im possbilit WAs aimed at in the attempt to combine the quajitm of a lghtig ship, a msail boat, and a tranport; the rate of peed was always less than it should be; the nneoessary weight of the vessel strained and broke down the best engines; and at the smme tima she would have no chance with a hostile war steamer (proper).
When the authorities have full digested the fact that it is yerymuch chexper for the iatioi to ecqey troops as exelo Jas le, thty wrill, peghegs, bUid large, 112t, and ommuodious veesols of gret posrer; at all events

The latter are the effective squadron of gunboats tludeTd to by Lord Panmure in the House of Lords on Thursdar night in the remark that, in addition to the large men-ofwar and troopships, " 16 vessels, having only a small draught of water, would be employed, and small steamerm would be drawn from the Pacific and used with them." The only ships and vessels employed on that station are the Monarch, 84; Tribune, 31; Satellite, 21; Pearl, 20; Esk, 20; Magicienne, 16; Alarm, 26; Havannab, 19; Cockatrice, 4; Nereus, 6; and Naiad, 6. Of these the only steamers are the Tribune, Pearl, and Esk, of the tonnage of about 2,000, 1,400, and 1,200 respectively. The Tribune, PGU4 and Esk have been ordered to join the China squadron; therefore we have accounted for them therein, although they cannot have reached yet, and the Magiciennehas not long been ordered to the Pacific from the Mediter. ranean; she is upwards of 1,20O tons.
The Himalaya will be at Spithead by the 26th to embark the 82d and other troops; the Transit will be ready in a day or two to embark the 23d Fusileers; and the Furious wil embark the 90th Regiment. Lloyd's have been appliedl to by the Admiralty to provide transports for the convey. ance of the other troops, camp equipage, munitions, and stores. The Shannon frigate has not been able to leave Spithead, owing to the violent gales, or to ship the guns and stores she is to carry out to China; the Echo steamtug was to have been employed on Saturday in carrying out ta her the guns and stores, but she could not have lain along. side the frigate to transship them could she have got out to her. The Shannon embarked on Saturday First-Lieutenant; Studdart, 1 sergeant, 1 corporal, 1 bombardier, and 22 gunners of the Royal Marine Artillery, for disposal by RearAdmiral Sir Michael Seymour, and each of the gunboats will, we believe, carry half-a-dozen or so of Marines or Marine Artillery. The Assistance and Adventure troop. ships are being fitted out to bear their portions of the contingent forces with tho utmost expedition.
Her Majesty having been pleased to grant a medal to the officers and crows of Her Majesty's ships employed in the Baltic campaigns from the 28th of March, 1854, to the close of the naval operations of that year, and from the com. mencement to the close of the naval operations in 1855, the Acoountant-General of the Navy has requested the Colonels Commandant of the four divisions of Royal Marines to furnish him with lists of the officers, noncommissioned officers, drummers and privates, now at; head-quarters, entitled to that medal, in order that it may be forwarded to them for distribution with the least possible delay.
The Colonel Commandant of the Woolwich Division of Royal Marines has eceived instructions to furnish 1 corporal and 4 privates to each of the following ganboats,about to be fitted out for servioo on the coast of China-viz., the Algerine, Bann, Brune, and Lee, to be fitted out at Woolwich, and the Woodcock and Watchful, to be fitted out at Deptford. The Bann and Brmne were on Saturday admitted into King William Dock at Woolwich to be furnished with Grant's patent condensing steam apparatus for distilhing Seawater. Each of the vessels abont to proceed on the Chinese expedition is ordered to be fitted out on the same principle. The Bann and Brune, built expressly for exploring the river Nile, are on the old paddle principle and of an extremely small draught of water,
The head-quarters of the 11th (Prince Albert's Own) Husmars, with their band, arrived at Chatham on Saturdaymorning from Canterbury, under orders to proceed to H ounslow Barracks The following officers were with their head-quarters :-Lieutenant-Colonel E. Peel, Brevet-Major E. Fellowes, Captain W. Foster, Lieutenant and Adjutant J. Yates, Lieutenant R. R. H. Dungate, Cornet D. S. Stewart, Assistant-Surgeon 0. B. Mller, and VeterinarySurgeon Anthony. The 2d and 3d Dragoon Guards, from Dublin, relieve the 11th Hussars at Canterbury.
The authorities of the War Department have directeo! that the whole of the available Purveyors, together with the Commsariat officers, now attached to the home stations, be held in readiness to proceed to China with the troops under orders for embarcation, with a view to make every part of the service as complete as possible. In addition to the modical officers already selected the following have ilso been ordered to embark for China, viz. :-Second-Class Staff-Surgoons T. Parr and Wellington Poole, both of whomi have been reheved from garrison duty at Chatham,
Her Majestfs sailing sloop Electra, 14, Commander William Morris (b), arrivod at Spithead yosterlay, from the Australian station. She is 108 days from Melbourne, and' 40 from Melbourne to the Falkland Islands; she met with calms nearly the whole voyage. The Falklands were tho only places she touched at; there was only one merchant: ship there when she left. The Electra took in the captain and part of the crew of the Lord George Bentinck, trader, of London, which foundered at sea near the Falklands; her crew and captain, l6 in all, took to a boat and were six days in her without any food but one pigeon; four of the crew were drowned. The Electra brought home Mr. Ciexeland, master of the Juno frigate on the Australian station. and 14,000Oz. of gold. She will go into Portsmouth har. bour to be paid off, having been four years and a half iz commission.
Captain Richard O'Connell's 9th company, 3d battalion, Royal Artillery, at Load-quarters, Woolwich, have been ordered tQ hold themselves in readiness to embark in a few days for the Mauritius; Captain Matthew Bligh Forbes'g Ist company, 4th battalion, for the Cape of Good Hope;. Captain Frederick Hugh ChanceUor's Ist eompany, 14tk battalion, for Canada; Captain Charles WaUer's 2d com. pany, 14th battalion, also for Canada; and Lieutenant. Colonel Samuel E. Gordon's 4th company, 14th battalion; and Captain Richard King Freeth's 3d company, for NOVA Scotia. ajor Frederick F. Lennox's company, No. 6,lst. battalion, A, are under orders for Guernsey.
