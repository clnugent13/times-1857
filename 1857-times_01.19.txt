ThlIs Company Is formed under the Joinst-Stock Limited Liabilit Act of last session, for the purpoe of supplsing the county ofNe vada, aLnd other districts in Caiornia, with water, and es3ecially for eetablishing and carrying to comspletion works situate in the county of Nevada, in the State of CallforslA wbich hace been tn progress for mnore thanx twoyearse and a'so for negotiating for the purchase of other works alreadyIn profitableoperaLtion.
Thewhole of these works command a district of 35 mDiles Inlength, and upwards of 600 square miles in area, knoWn to be auriferous throughiout, and for too development of which there is no other possible mneans of supply hot that which will he poesered by this Company.
The primary object of these works is to give a tteady and coontinnous gupply of water throuchout the year. for wKhich there is an unlimited demand, to the mInners enguged in this, one of the most valuable and thicekly-settled dietricts of the whole State of CalifornIa.
It Is well underatood that the sole drawback to the still greater psroductivenes of this highly ausiferous regIon is the want of a sufficient and continuous water supply for mlunug operations during a considerable part of the yeas, known as the dry season.
The reports of the two Euglish gentlemen who were deputsd at dif. fe entpe'Iods to investigate the merits ol the enterprise tegether wlth
ampof the district and detailed information. hr whirls an e-tlumale ca eforme-d of the extraordinary inpects of this undertaking, are pusblished in apamphilet. andmesy hr d at theollicmsoftheCompany.
It may be sufficient hero to state, that the lowes dividend estimated by these gentlemen, after making liberal allowanceoi forscotingenciea, exceeds ±10 per cent. per anDnum on the entire capItal.
An agent, selected by the Board, will be imamediately Kenit out at the expnene of the pro&ecior with instrutono to PIS himself in comomunication with anx influential mercantllo fiM at San F~rancLeco, and in conjunction wita them strictly to ioveetigats all matlers coninect-rd with the undertAkingI.
If the result of such investigation prove ratisfactory. the azent will he empowered to complete the arrangemeniti for carroing-out the obiects of the Company forthwith. Sbould the Directors however, be Induced. hey the report of their agent, to decline the purchwse of the rights and works above alluded to. the whole amount of the subecrip. touns otlibe retuTned to the ibarensoloers A'tbout deduiction.
To prve their confidence in the profitable character of this undertaking, the CalIfornian Proprietors have coDnseniol to receive payrme0t for all their rights, interests,t and outlay in shares of the Compan3Y, Class A and have agrceea that such shares -.-halt nos for the period of three soars from the coDmpletIon) of the puarchase be entitled to di-i. dend, unless in the meantime a dividend at the rate of 20 pe cent, Per

A traffi arrangement for a term of Years has been entered Into with the Eastern Counties Railway Cik-rpany on advantageous tarsus and the Directors have secured the ocooperatIon of the authoriuseB of the Dutch-Rthenish Ralway Company, and the other inland navigation aLnd railway establishments in Holand aLnd German-y; all of whom are so convincoed of the advantages to be cerived from thisIlsDeof commuotcation, as the moat desirble for passenger traffic, and the speedy conveyance ot merchandise and Vtrishable goods, that, they are anxiaous to promote tue views of this Company to the fullest pessible extent.
The town of Harwicha is 68 miles fromn London by railway, and Its part is the meet cuircuient for direct communication between London and all the great seaports in Hfolla,.d and Bielgiumni, nd thence to the northern and oentral parts of the corttineut of EuroPe,
Passengers proceeding en lndis, vil TrieSte, by HarwtCb, Rotterdamn, and the Dutots-Rhenlsh Rail way, will effect a saving of 48 hours, as compaNred with its rouse vAP Marseilles,
The harbour of Harwich is sa"o, commodious, and easy of accEss in all weathers and states of the tide-aclvantaao; which nuo other port possesses on the eatternt coast south of the Humber.
By t1aopeuing of this route, vift Harwichi, the dangers and delays of the Itrtrcate navigation of the Swin, and thebonxoth of the Rtiver Thbames are voided,whereby a aving of timeIs elfectedtI-slHaxburg, Rotterdams. and Antvrerp of from 10 toll hours;' while the route to Oberhausen. and thence to the nurhemn parts of Euriope is 31 hours; less by Haronch and Rotterdams than that by Dover and Ostend, as per tabulr statement. and thus the former must become the direct route of postal conmimunirtion,

Saturday Evening.
The English funds opened to- day at the closing irikes of last evening, but although the market sElowed some steadiness at the commencement it ultimately became heavy. Consols for money were first quoted 93a to i, andthe finaltransactions were at 93@ for money and 932 to i for the 5t.i of February. The improvement on the Paris B,urse yesterday afternoon was the cause of the tendency to firmness in the earlier hours, but the continued demand for gold to purchase silver and the apprehension that if it should go on unchecked it might induce the Bank to advance their rate for bills having more than two months to run discouraged the speculators for a rise. The general transactions of the day were unimportant. The Bank returns for the past week proved more favourable than had been anticipated, the bullion having been upheld by a return of some of the gold recently despatched to Ireland. Bank Stock left off at 216 to 218; Reduced, 93J to 94; New Three per Cents., 94i to i; India Stock, 219 to 221; Exchequerbonds, 98i to 99; and India-bonds and Exchequerbills, 2s. discount to 2s. premium.
In the discount market and at the Bank to-day the demand was very moderate.
Foreign securities remain inactive, but prices have been fairly supported. There was an absence of business in Turkish, but the nominal quotations were 94-i to 5i for the Six per Cents., and 103± to A for the Four per Cents. Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents. were dealt in at 79; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 961; Spanish, passive, 6§; Venezuela, for account, 36; and Dl utch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 64g.
The closing quotations from the Paris Bourse this evening again failed to arrive.
The letters from Paris continue to repeat the rumour that the Bank of France are to be called upon to increase their capital and to employ it in Rentes. The first part of the statement is probably correct, but the latter is questionable. At Haamburg the rate of discount has advanced to G per cent.
A further sum of about 80,0001. in gold was taken from the Bank to-day to pay for silver purchased on the continent.
The formal acceptance of the concession for the Turkish National Bank was despatched to Constantinople the day before yesterday. Meanwhile nothing further has transpired regarding the principles on which the establishment is to be definitively constituted. Assuming the leading conditions already promulgated in London to be unaccompanied by any drawback, and that it is the intention of the Turkish Government to allow the details to be arranged solely with a view to the legitimate wants of the country and the permanent interests of the Bank, they would appear to afford a foundation for all that can properly be required. The statement that it is intended the institution should be modelled, as far as possible, on the best features of the Bank of France and the Bank of England, is favourable, but in the present case there is a function to be performed for which routine experience furnishes little light, and which involves very critical consequences, not only as relates to the success of the experiment, but also to the specie question in England and other countries. This is the restoration of the Turkish currency. The existing circulation seems to be estimated at 8,000,0001., of which more than two-thirds consist of paper in the form of Treasury notes bearing various rates of interest, while the remainder is made up of coin in different stages of depreciation. The whole is to beredeemedby the Bankeitherin specie or its equivalent and upon whatever may prove to be its amount tae Turkish Government are to allow to the Bank an annual rate of 0 per cent. It will be said, if the Bank, with a nominal capital of 10,000,0001. or 12,000,0001., are to employ 8,000,0001. in this manner, and to receive for it only 6 per cent. on the security of the Turkish Government, the prospect is such as no one would accept, especiaUy while Turkish Six per Cent. Bonds, secured by the Egyptian tribute and always negotiable, can be purchased in London at 95. But this modc of putting the matter would be erroneous. While the Bank would receive from the Government 6 per cent. on 8,000,0001. their actual outlay would amount only to a small proportion of that total. They are to have an exclusive right to issue notes payable on demand, but which, like those of the Bank of England, will doubtless be made a legal tender between all other parties; and it is fair to presume that these will, in a great measure, take the place of the currency the Bank are called upon to provide for. Supposing only half of the 8,000,0001. to be thus supplied the position of the Bank would be as follows:-They would have received about 6,000,0001. of Governimnt paper and about 2,000,0001. in coin. On the other hand, they would have disbursed 4,000,0001. of specie and issued 4,000,0001. of their own notes. The result thus iar would be an actual cash outlay of 2,000,0001. Against their own notes, however, they would have to maintain a specie reserve of a third, or about 1,333,0001. Their entire outlay would therefore be 3,333,0001., exclusive of expenses. Tlpon this the allowance by the Turkish Government of 6 per cent. on 8,000,0001. would be equal to 14 per cent. The latter, therefore, is apparently that which under the least favourable view should be regarded as the rate granted by the concession. It may even be contended, and not altogether vithout grounds, that in this estimate the probable results are too narrowly stated. There is no room to doubt that the conveniences of a paper circulation, guaranteed by the periodical publication of the bulion held against it,will be at least as fully appreciated in Constantinople and the other principal cities of the Turkish empire as in any part of the world. The intelligence of the Greek houses, who command aU the leading business, and the great faith of the Turkish population when they find they are being honestly dealt with, appear to insure this result. It is possible, therefore, that the circulation of the new bank may prove equal in amountto that which is about to be withdrawn, and in that case the advantages enjoyed wiU proportionably increase. Admitting, however, the full force of these considerations, great care wil be required to be exercised by the founders in adjusting not only the mode of carrying out the object in question, but also the terms on which the capital of the bank is to be called up. The immediate solidity of the establishment and the convenience of the money-markets of London and Paris are alike concerned in these matters. If the redemption of the currency were to be effected by a sudden operation, it would be necessary for the bank to provide themselves with an amount of bullion nearly equal to the whole of it, since they could not rely that their own notes would at once be accepted to any large extent by a population not familiarized with them; and to provide this they would be obliged to caU up almost their entire capital, while they would at the same time establish a most disturbing drain upon our market. If, on the contrary, the redemption is effected in notes, a certain percentage of which are made to become convertible at periods extending altogether over 10 or 12 months, the entire operation wil most likely be completed without the necessity of a single ounce of gold being procured from this side, the advantage being also gained of less than one-half of the nominal capital of the bank being required to be paid up even by the end of that period. The abundance of English sovereigns at present spread throughout Turkey is such that, so far from the
oank caing for our gold, they might be the means of affording the holders of these sovereigns a safer medium, and thus accelerate their reshipment hither. In relation to the amount of capital, as the chief business of the bank, beyond the control of the circulation, would, in the first instance, be that of assisting the revenue collections and conducting the payments of the Government at a certain charge, in a manner analogous to that of the Bank
of England, there could b no pretext for a sum being called up much beyond that which would be
needed for a proper bullion reserve. Looking at the grave interests thus involved, and the extraordinary commercial development which both the European and Asiatic provinces of Turkey seem destined to attain, and which has hitherto been retarded as much by the absence of roads and of a sound
currency system as by any political causes, it will be seen that the subject invites the most vigilant attention ; that it will be the duty of all our financial and trading classes to watch the spirit in
which its promoters frame their plans; to give everv encouragement to the undertaking if, upon a careful scrutiny, all its terms shall prove consistent with simple and rigid principles that are to be inviolably upheld; and to denounce it if they find the taint of an attempt, direct or indiret, to introduce a sinale
feature such as would indicate that the mind sat work upon it have been in the slightest degree cor-
rupted by the Credit Mobilier mania on the continental bourses.
The railway meetings of the week have not been numerous. The shareholders of the East Lancashire Company and of theLancashire and Yorkshire Company have agreed to amalgamate, thetermsofarrangementbeing considered equitable. The directors of the London, l,righton, and South Coast Company propose a dividend of 3i per cent, on the consolidated stock for the six months ending the 31st of December, makhng a total dividend of 6 per cent. for the year. At a special meeting of the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway the directors were authorized to apply to Parlament for power to open a communication from Eendal to the North-Western Railway at Ingleton. According to the Blanchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire report the amount of ordinary dividend, after the payment of preference charges, -will be at the rate of 1 per cent. per annum, leaving a balance of 4,5001. The dividend declared at the meeting of the London and Greenwich Railway was 5s. 2d. per share, leaving a small balance to be carried forward. At a meeting of the inhabitants of Bungay resolutions in favour of a project for affording railway communication between Harleston and Bungay were adopted.
The prospectus has been issued of the Nassau Railway Company, with a capital of 1,600,0001. in 201. shares, against which amount the Nassau Government grant the company 1,000,0001. in 4 per cent. bonds, while 200;0001. has been subscribed and paid by Wiesbaden shareholders. The railway will cornrise about 120 miles (about ?9 of wvhich are wholly or partially completed), and will form the link to bring Wiesbaden, Rudesheim, Ems, and Weilborg into connexion with all the principal German lines. The payment is proposed of a high rate of interest during construction, and sanguine statements are put forth of the returns to be realized thereafter.
It is now stated that the amount of specie to be despatched by the Peninsular and Oriental steamer Pera on the 20th -will be about 360, 0001.
The Emigration Commissioners have advertised for vessels to carry emigrants to Sydney and Adelaide, to be ready for passengers between the 3d and 10th of March, as may be hereafter determined.
The following is from the writer of one of the communications inserted yesterday on the case of "Kingsford v. Merry" -
"1 Sir,-As it is supposed Article 6 of my letter of the 15th regarding the case of ' Kingsford v. Merry' may be nlisapprehended, permit me to add that its hypothesis had no reference whatever to the plaintiffs, whose whole conduct in the transaction has been perfectly honourable and straightforward. "I remain, &c., S. S."
The annual volume of Bailwiaiy IXtelligemice, compiled from official returns by Afr. Slaughter, the secretary of the railways department of the Stock Exchange, and published under the sanction of the committee of that establishment, has just been issued. It is in a new and improved form, and containis information regarding the amounts of capital authorized and the movements in the various debenture debts, together with full particulars of the revenue of the principal companies in a manner not previously adopted. It also gives lists of directors, auditors, &c., and a table of the Bank rates of discoiuint for the last 20 years.
The annexed information relative to the progress of English mining adventure is condensed from the Alisinig Journal:-
"There has been again a veryactivemarket forprogressive mines, and a fair amount of business has been done in dividend shares. At Wheal Uny meeting the accounts showed a balance in favour of the mine of 1171.; a call of 5s. per share was made. At Camborne Consols meeting on Wednesday (Mr. W. A. Thomas in the chair), the accounts showed a balance of 3081.; a call of 10s. per share was made. At Coed Mawr Poolmeeting the accounts showed a balance in arrear of 941. At South Garras meeting the accounts showed a balance against adventurers of 1841. At Wheal Gilmar meeting the accounts showed a balance against adventurers of 4471.; a call of 9s. per share was made. At West Wheal Jane meeting the accounts showed a balance in favour of the mine of 2281. ; a cal of Is. 6d. per share was made. At Craddock Moor meeting the accounts showed a balance against the mine of G81. At Gonamena meeting the accounts showed a balance against adventurers of 5931.
With regard to foreign mining the following is worthy of extract *-
" The Imperial Brazilian Mining Association have advices dated GongoSoco, to November29, 1856 :-The works inthe mine have been prosecuted with all the neans at command, and the produce has increased to 71b. 5oz. lSdwts., against 31b. loz. 14dwt., the produce of last month. Devars shoot has not yet been intersected, although every effort has been used to find it, and the explorations now being carried on are in tho immediate locality where the shoot should be. The Royal Santiago advices reach to December 15. In the 32, driving east of the north cross-cut, on north lode, the lode is improved, and is about 2ft. wide, yielding from 2 to 3 tons of copper ore per fni. In the stopes in the 44, driving east from junction, the lode is from 5 to 6 ft. 'Wide, produciuag frnm 2 to 3 tons of copper ore per fm. In the 56, driving west, the lode is from 2 to 3 ft. wide, producing about 3 tons of copper ore per fm. At St. Andrew's, in the 12, driving west of Scott's shaft, the miners have opened through ore ground about 3',fm., producing from 2 to nearly 6 tons of copper ore per ffm. for the whole length. This end appears to improve every foot, the lode reducing about 6 tons of copper ore per fm. Te Mariquita Company have received advices, of which the following is an abstract :-Santa Anaminesfor October, 1856-Cost, $9,539 ; returns, $14,141 ; returns for November, $15,470; cost not yet received. Marmato Mines for October, 1856-Cost, $12,428; returns, $13,180. Purima Mines for October, 1856-Cost, $5,400; returns, $5,485; the cost includes $414 for new milL The directors of the St. John del Rey Company have received advices by the steamer Tyne, showing the quantity of gold producedcin the montl of October to be 26,079 oitavas, from 7,196 tons of stone, at a cost of 7,4681., and yielding 2,029., profit. The South Australian Copper Mining Company have received the following report from their captain on the mine, dated Oct. 1, 1856:-'In my last I stated that I had received orders to commence sinking Bassett's engine shaft, which I have not failed to do. We commenced in the bottom of the shaft on the Sth of September. We have sunk this month 8 ft. 6 inches; so the shaft is now down 20 fm. 1 ft. The shaftis allin thecountry nowunder thelode, about 3 ft. from the foot wall, and is full of small strings of mundio and rich yellow copper ore; in fact, the ground, water, and everything connected with the lode is completely mineralized throughout, and the foot wall of the shaft is still bursting with water, so that it appears to me that the shaft is going down between two lodes. the one copper and the other lead. U to this time we have sent away about 240 tons of ore, anahave above 200 more ready for port.' The Mexican and South American Company have received advices from their smelting establishments in Chili to the lst of December; the Henry Ranking sailed from Herradura on the 30th of November with a cargo of 420 tons of copper regalus and copper; the Isabella is being loaded."

THEATRICAL COPYRIGHT.-At the Bloomsbury
TnHEA CAL COPYRIG 1T.- t the Bloomsbury Count7 Court on Friday Mr. Heath, the judge, gave judgment in the case of "Planch6 v. James," in which a case of some importance to the theatrical profession was raised. The plaintiff is the well-known dramatic writer, and brought an action against Mr. James, the lessee of the Queen's Theatre, Tottenham-street, to recover a penalty of 40s. for a performance of a farce called A PNcaeant Neighbour, under the act 3d of William IV., chap. 15. The cause was tried in December, aud the defence was that at the time of the representation the theatre was let to Mr. George Bolton, and that he was consequently liable. In answer Mr. Lewis (Lcwis and Lewis), as solicitors to the Dramatic Authors' Society, aubmitted that under the act regulating theatfes (6th and 7th of Victoria, chap. 68) the license of the lord Chamberlain was to Mr. James, and that for the protection of the public he was the person liable for all matters connected with the theatre, and that, although the theatre was let, lie*ould be bound to obey apy interdiction from the Lord ChaOberlain. By the 7th section of the act the license could only be granted to the " actual and responsible manager for the tine being of the theatre." The judge took time to consider, and novv said he was clearly of opinion that the defendant was liable. He thought so at the time; but, as the *matter was of some importance, he did not wish hastily to decide it. Judgment was given for the plaintiff for a penalty of 40s: and costs. In the act (3d of Wiliam IV., ch ap. 15) the costs are specified as "double costs of suit.")

A Voice From The Green-Room.
A VOICB FROM THE GBRBN-BOOjV.
TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Would you for the benefit of mankind (and myself in particular) insert in your universal journal the following suggestion on railway travelling? The idea painfully prePented itself to me by the recital of the awful and calamitouis disasters that day after day we have had recorded of the dreadful loss of life at sea consequent upon the destructive gales with which it has pleased Divine Providence to visit us. But I was delighted to read that by the application of the agency I shall hereafter propose many a brave heart has already been rescued from a wreck at sea and a watery grve.
Therefore, I am of opinion if the same action wero applied many a wreck ashore might be avoided. For instance, a gallant ship and brave crew were saved last week at the back of the Isle of Wight by the firing of alarm rockets and burning blue lights. Consequently, I submit the same agency might be employed to obviate the disasters to which we are liable on our railway transit.
For example: at the beginning of this winter (at night), ? luggage train broke down on the North-Western line in a remote part of the country, and having no means of reporting the disaster the consequence was that a multitude of Up and down trains were delayed 24 hours.
Now, Sir, had the broken-down train been supplied with alarm rockets or blue lights the dreadful consequence; maight have been avoided. Tho firing of rockets in an isolated part of the country would be discernible for miles; therefore the natural precaution of station masters would be to detain the trains until the nature of the calamity had been ascmrtained.
Again, should a train (which is not unfrequent) break down iu a tannel, the continuous burning of the blue light would indicate the danger and warn approachin-
rains tCAt none but the inhabitants are allowed to lodge here.
Again, Sir, if at some two or three miles before reaching abarp curve I signal rocket was fired, and not answered, it might with safety proceed. Had such a precaution been observed some six years bygone at the station of Straffan. near Dublin, it would have saved the lives of many of our fellow-creatures, and nearly 100.0001. to the railway.
Hoping yol. will review this lengthy commnnication with consideration, I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

At the general meeting of this company, to be held on the 29th inst., after the ordinary business is disposed of an agreement will be snbmitted to the proprietors for their approval for carrying into effect the arrangements entered into between the London, Brighton, and South-Coast Railway Company and the West-end of London and Crystal Palace RalUway Company, for the working, use, and maintenance of the latter railway. The proprietors wil also have to consider the propriety of leasing the Wimbledon and Croydon Railway, and, if approved, to sanction the acceptance of the lease.
CARMARTHEN ANTD CARDIGAN.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at Carmarthen on Tnursday; Mr. J. R. Lloyd in the chair.
The CRAIRNtMAS remarked on the small attendance, and showed the importance the line would be to the town of Carmarthen.
The report of the directors stated that the contract for the construction of the line from the junction of the South Wales Railway at Carmarthen to Llandyssil.about 20 miles had been let to Mr. Jay, contractor, of London. The contract was for 165,0601,, including everything except the permanent way, and the works were to be finished by the dIst of March, 1859. The line would be of cheap construction, and would afford accommodation to an important district, besides which it would constitute part of a trunk line through the centre of Wales, and join a direct route from 3Ianchester to Iilford Haven. The accounts had been made up to Midsuimmer last, clearing up all previous liabilities, which had been unusually heavy on account of the Parliamentary opposition to the bill. The directors had arranged for the immediate construction of that portion of the line between the Carmarthen station of the South Wales Railway into the town of Carmarthen-abont one mile and a-half, which would be completed in about eight months.
A discussion took place on the motion for the adoption of the report, in the course of which Mr. Jay, the contractor, said that if the inhabitants of Carmarthen came forward to aid the undertaking he would undertake to complete the lino into Carmarthen in four months, and the whole of the works in a gear and a-half from the present time. The report was adopted, and the meeting shortly afterwards broke up.
ROYAL SWEDISII.
The report of thelEnglish directors of this company states, that owing to the extreme scarcity of money and the damaged credit of the company, only 30,193 of the preference shares had b2.en ied. The directors considered this subscription sufficient, in addition to the assets of the company, to complete the first half of the line, and liquidate aU recognized debts. They therefore decided to proceed, in preference to sacrificing the property. They intend, if that course be approved by the meeting, to limit the issue to 40,000 shares, and then to close the sub. scription, at any rate until the first half of the line shall be in complete working condition. Tbey regret extremely that tho share certificates are not yet delivered. The English board appointed Mr. G. Miller resident director in Sweden at a salary of 1,000. per annum, including travelling and other expenses in Sweden. Tho claims of the creditors of the company demanded the attention of the present board immediately on their appointment. The number of the creditorsl was nearly 50; the amount of the real debts about 90,5001., of which 19,4211. has been paid, leaving in round numbers 70,0001. The impossibility of finding money to so large an amount led the directors to offer preference shares in payment. After long negotiations arrangements were concluded with all the known creditors, but one whose claim amounts to 3,4821. The arrangement made provides for the taking among the creditors of 9,453 paid up preference shares, representing 37,8121. of debt, in addition to those taken by the public. It is intended to pay the balance of the debts in February. Every demand was submitted to a close examination, and upwards of 22,0001. worth of claims have been thus far successfully resisted. The directors desire publicly to acknowledge the indulgence and courtesy shown by the bo7uP ffde creditr
of the company. It was long befote any representative of the late Mr. Sadleir was named, and concurrently with the appointment a suit for the administration of the estate was instituted by his representatives. The claim of this company has been made, but has not yet been adjudicated on by the Court. The accounts of the company have been completed to the 31st of December last. They show the gross receipts by the present board, irrespective of the value of the shares taken by the creditors, 52 257L - payments, 47,5601., of which 24,1751. has been remitted to Sweden for employment on the works and pay. ment of advances, and 7,6421. has been spent in the purchase of stock and materials in England. The assets (other than the line and roiling and other stock upon it) amiount to 58,885M.; and the liabilities to 46,7001. The company is involved in no sort of litigation whatever, and no proceeding instituted against the company has gone beyond the first step. This result has been effected not by payments under pressure, but by negotiation, notwithstanding the large amount of debts, and that about 40,0001. of such debts were on dishonoured acceptances. hIr. Close. named as a director at the last meeting, in consequence of otherand pressing engagements, did not accept office. Mr. Charles Edward Newcomen was, on the 14th of August lst, electedin his stead. MIr. Wiliam Rartridge was elected a director on the same day. Mr. Tottie, the Swedish director in England, and deputy-chairman of the English board, has tendered his resignation, but the board have declined to accept it until the plea6are of the shareholders on the subject maybe known. The directors have effected or arranged for the re-delivery to the company of 14,680 obligations - and a parcel of 10,000 of the overiasued ordinary shares vwill, it is anticipated, be immediately delivered up. A moro ecoriomical management has been secured; and none of the persons who were connected with the management of the company or in its servioe in England during Mr. Sadleir's time are now in any way connected with it.
The concession originally granted to the company reserves an option to the Government to acquire the line on payment of a premium above the value to be assessed by arbitration. The interest on the caution money deposited in the Swedish Treasury has been regularly paid, as heretofore, and the company has continued to enjoy uninterruptedly all the privlteges attached to the original concession. Should the Government purchase the line, the price to be received, in whatever form given, will be applicable first in payment of all debts and claims on the company, then in settlement with the obligation-holders, then in pay. ment of the sums subscribed by the preference shareholders. before the ordinary shares can be entitled to any participaton. The directors will be obliged again to request the indulgence of the obligation-holdersfora further delayin the pay. mentoftheirinterestuntil thefirst 45nmilesof the lineshalibe open for traffic, and the claims of the creditors which rank before the obligations shall have been finally liquidated. The directors have, in accordance with their promise, caled the shareholders together before proceeding to make the 8econd call of 11. on the preFerence shares. The English directors have individually subscribed for and are holders of 4,200 preference shares, and have not taken, neither do they ask, any rexmueration for their services, until the prosperity of tihe company iS more assured.

The Adulteration Of Flour And Bread.-
THE ADLTERATION Op FLOUIR AND BREAD.- The Lancat has just commenced a new series of reports under the old title of the " Analytical Sanitary Commission on the Adulteration of Food and Medicine." That contained in the Lancet of the 17th inst. is upon the adulteration of flour and bread. It appears that there is an article in common and daily use by bakers denominated " Cones," or "Cones flour ;" this when genuine consists entirely of the flour of a particular kind of wheat, denominated " Rivit wheat." It is used by bakers to dust the boards upon which the dough is made into bread, as well as the dough itself, the object being to provent the dough from adhering to the boards, or the loaves to each other; but, as willappear immediately, it is likeewise employed for other purposes. Of 22 samples of Cones' flour subjected to examination five only were genuine, and the other 17 adulterated, consistin of mixtures of rice, bean, barley, rye flour, and Indian corn meal, together with, in one or two cases, salt and alum. Cones' floar is, therefore, subject to an enormous amount of adulteration, the object of the various additions made to it being to cheapen the article as well as to adapt it for adnlteration. That Cones' flour is frequently employed in the adulteration of bread is shown in some cases by the character of some of the adulterations to which it is subject, as those by admixture with bean flour. alum, and salt. Now bean flour is actually of a more glutinous nature than pure wheat flour of good quality, and therefore its presence in Cones! flour tends to unft it for the very purpose for which t is alleged that it is designed. Some bakers have even cknowlcdged to the employmnent of Cones' flour for the purpose of adulteration. In the article Cones' floor, prpared by the millers, "bakers, then," states the report, "are furnished with a material avowedly wheat 90onr, but bwicb, ^onsisting of mixtures of differnt and cheaper flours, is in every way suited for the adulteration of bread, and that it is extensively used for this purDose cannot be doubted. The public know nothing of this article; the master bakers theaaselves are ignorant of itA real composition, while the journeyman, in most cases, Nvben ho add, by his master's directions. & bushel o' C--ues' to a sack of flour, bas no idea that he is adulteratiig the bread."

MANCHESTER, JT. 17.
There has not been cauch inquiry this; orin and it is probable there will be little further buinesutlthe
market for the raw material is in a More settled state. After the continued riso of cotton for severa weeks a rection wasteo be expected; but if the stocks of cotton in the I bands of spinners aere as large as sotne snpose, enabling them to hold back from the market for any lenothof time, it is possible that prices maY recede hore sdsi ly from tho highest rate than hitherto, and give a check to business her for somne weeks to come. In yarns buyers operate 'ort
much caution at present, and are withonly uton lhih and pressing orders. The average transactions of the 'week
hehae been inconiderable, and the same MAY be said of the loth-mnarket. The market for shrtings has been quieter since the India nail came to band, and, though prices are not quotably lower, buyers practically find that they have P slighr advantage.
BIRUMIGHAM, JAt?. 17.
The orders received for South Staffordshire iron thrOUh Liverpool houses, chiefly for the United States and tbe Canadas, are much larger than received at corrsponding periods of the last two years; but, as is usal, the excitement which prevails during the week in which the quarterly meetings of the ironmasters are held has been followed by a lull which by some might be construed into inactivity. The deiand both tor home and abroad continues unabated, and prices, as settled last week, are firmly naintained, with a decided tendency to a further advance.
On Tuesday and Wednesday last the quarterly meetings of the district-so far as the general factoring and manufacturing businesses of the neighbourood re a concerned. weresheld at Walsall and Wolvirbampton. lt wmbe recollected that the appointed days of the previouni week (fixed by the iron tie) a were -not recognized 4 the greater
ption of the trAdespeople of these towns, and that consequenitly many of the manufacturers of Birmingham aniF' other distant places were compelled to maake a second journey toe obtainf the ettlement of their accounts. It ig satisfactory to know, however, that on the days of the present week which were deemed those only upon which parties ought to be caled upon, the accounts of t he last quarter were satisfactorily balanced.
Tbhre bas been lttle observable change in any of the leading trades of Birmingham. They continue to be moderately, but not so extraordinars l active as they have oeen represented. Employmaent generally is much better than duringthe war, but trade, though greatly improved, is scarcely so brisl as the over-sanguine expected it would be on the
return of peace. Business is,' however, steady, if it is~ quiet; and i most branches it mayabe said that the work in hanid is to supply immedtae erements and not for stonck. For some months past t igh prices of metals and the constant tendency to iurther advances have prevented manufacturers worling for stocks, and now when the demnds oflthe country are greatly on the increase many of the manufactornes exhibit, as compared with their condition a few months ago, unwonted activity. It is in branches of trade not directly connected with the staple manufactures of the town and neighbourhood that labour, skiled and unskiled, is least abundant. The bulding trade, with all its dependents, is still very indifferent; and this may be jude of by the fact that, while in 1853 no fewer than 2,784 additional houses were built in the borough of Birmingham only 803 were erectedI in 1856.
Yesterday in the Birminghdam. Cour of Bankruptcy a meeting was held before the Cemnissionerfor the choice of assignees in the bankruptey ofMessrs. Rice, Harris, andSon, glass manufacturers. Their unsecured debts, according to. the balance-sheet exhibited, amount to btween 21,0001. and 22,000fk, and secured liabilities to between 6,0001. and 7,0001. No estimate has yet been made of the probable assets, but appearances are not hopeful.
A meeting of the creditors of Mers, Turner and Farloy'e bank was held at Kidderminster on Thursday last to take into consideration the necessary steps to secure a proper investigation of the assets and habilities.

A gooa demand for hosiery continues. Considerable inquiry has been made for goods, but all useful articles are scarce, the warehouses being seldom so bare of stock as at present. goods have again advanced in price, and they will continue to do soas oarns in stock are gradualUy worked off, it being impossibleto replace them at past rates.
Spinners, however, are sfarsely o fim this week. They apainclined to ielda elittle, owing to price of rawdct in Liverpool being somewhat lower.
The lace houses are mot doing miuch at present, the deman for home use not having at present set in.

LYTTON, M.P.
On Friday night Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, was ei.ttrtaired at a1 public dinner in the Glasgow GallerY Of Ai t in aclrnowledginent of his distinguished literary atmain. pmeats. The comipany -was onoe of the most influential embrsrt ing gentlemen of all political parties, that has ever
-iwai bled ina Glaggow, and the proceedings were of the roost 'dFlithtfal character.
`1 0e Hen. the Lord Provost was in the chair, supported on the right by the distinguished guest of the evemnm Sir E. B3. L)tton; Sir Jobn Maxwell, of Polloci the ve. De. Bill; Mr. Cuinming Bruce, M.P.; Colonel Pole, corn3standing the garirison; Lieutenant-Colonel Hawley, author -of Lady Lees' Widowh-Jood', The Story of the Cantlaigos, &-c.
and Mr. Walter Buchanan, of Sbandon. On the left,I by the Earl of Elgin, K.T.- Sir Archibald Alison; Baihie Gaslbraith; Mr. iCayley,'k,P.l'; Mr. Willamn Stirling, of Xeir, lily.; Professor Avtoun, of Edinburgh; and Mr. Sheriff Bell. Sir James Canripbell fulfilled the duties of croupier, supIorted on the right by Sir Michael Shaw Stewart, 2sl1. .; M1r. William ~Stirling, of Kenniure ; the Rev. Dr. ,Cyaik; Mr. WVilliam Ilamiltont, of Northpark; Mlr. H. E. (hyum Ewing, of Strathleven; Mr. Alexande-r Morrison, iha-n of Faculty; and MAr. Willam Baird, of Elie; and on -tl,e ltf t by Sir Janies Fergus-on, M. P.
A blessing having been asked by the Rev. Professor Hill, lhe corn panY partook of a splendid dinner, the table being xeplenijshed with aill the delicacieps of the season.
The CnAIstRMAN? proposed " the Queen," &c.
2Ihe CH3AIRnIANS then called for a special bumper to the -tcast of " the navy and array." (Cheers.)
Colonel POLE returned thaniks.
His LoRiussjiirthen called for aspecial bumnper. He spoke as follo-ws:-Gentlcinen,-We are met on thisvey ineet
aI1g eccaI~.c. for the piurpose of offering the hospitalitynolf our 21'ercantil,$etropolisi to a distinguaished stranger, and of bidding wftlcome to one of England's highly, gifted sons. (Cheers.) The visit to Glasgow of Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton at the present tirme has been taken advanitage of by a great miany off his literary friends to offer humbly this public demr-nstration as a mnark of their admiration for his great and viaried attanments as a scholar, a novelist, and a poet. Theo *corapany around these tables, composed as it is of all parties, proves the estimation in which hie is held as an author, and the world-wide reputation he has acquired, and which iasa secured for him so enviable a niche mn the Temple of Fame. (Cheers.) Sir Edward has been before the public for over three decades, and during that long Deriod no iwan of our time hsts written so much or so cl;armingly. Vith the exception of our own Sir Walter Scott, there as, perhaps, no other examiple of sutch varied literary and scholastic merit. ~o man has so truly painted lifein allits heanging-aspect~s,or conituredupso many beautiful and vivid -es eations ot the imagination. His works, whether of poetry, 1prose, or the dranma, have blunted all the shafts of criticism, am.d won f or binsi a fame that the moat ambitious scholar -eruld scarcely ever have dreamed of realizing. (Cheers.) In this great commercial community, where so much of our tine is occupied with the business of life, how often have 'we been refreblhed and delighted by tse elegant productions of his penl falling periodically upon us, in oar hiours of relaxationi, to cheer and enliven our homes and our firesides ; and not by us only, hut in every climate and country where our language is known, have thiese works been eagerly read by delighted thousands. They have also found their way, by translation, to Germany, France, and other civilized nations. 'To recapitulate the titles of the very_nutnerous books Sir Ed. vard baaswritten would tire you.. Yet our hope is, that the pwer our talented guest possesses inso emiinent a degreereasy the long continued, and that the world may be still further -charmed by the beauty and brilliancyof his poetic and artistic yFenius. It is one of the happy peculiarities of the present age thlat merit, in whatever field it may be occupied, has itsreward both mnaterialy and by popular esteemi in the lifetime of the labourer. Th'Iis is more apparenit when we contrast the bonours and rewards of this age with the ill-requited exertious which sonic of the great minds of former timnes ob-tained-nien wvho were for the most part dependent upon some kind patron and the scanty profits of limited editions. But thanks to the improvemients of the press, which now not only produces the quarto and octavo for the dIrawingr,omn or the palace, hut sends forth the shilling voluime, the million can read and admire the selfsame beautiful verses and sublime writings that the rich could only atone time E njoy, and by thisvwide circulation it gives to authors substantial aiid immnediate rewa-rd as well as world-wide famne and immortality. (Cheers.) Upon a similar occasion to the present our city did itself honour by inviting. the author of the Plcasunme.i of Hope to a public banquet, in -which all parties joined _; and it rejoices me to be present and to have the honour of presiding at this entertainment, ,abere so large a number of the citizins have miet to do like 1'cr(,ur to the talented author of the ('a.xons. I therefore t-k 3ou to joiu sose in giving a hearty welcome and dedi,c atingi a flowving bunii er to " the health of Sir Edward
The toast was pledged with the utmost enthusiasm.
Sir E. B. LYTTo.N rose amid loud and protractedI cheer. ing. H-e spoke as follows:-You will readily conceive that I find it, di'ticult to thiank you fittinigly. I have received so many manifestations of kindness during my visit to your ancient and faimous city thiat the recollections of all of them crowd upon soce now that I rise to acknowledge the crowning honour wvhiclh this entertainment is intended to bestow. (Cheers.) The Romans Emnperor wished that Rome had a single neck that ho nought strik-e off the head at a blow. I wis that Glasgowv had a shiigle liand that I might clasp it in one grateful pressure. (Loud cheers.) That it has not is any only regret. I was received with so much warmth by -the learnedI of your famous university yesterday that its -renmembranco will last as long as I exist. I am receivedI to-day by the wealth and eniterprise of this great city -with unexampled splendour, elegance, and refinement.
'W)hen I heard that national sir (" A man's a mnan for a' that") which preceded my rising, I could not help the more regretting that the shortness of my stay bere does not allow me also to make the acquaintance of -the great mass of the Glasgow population, including its mnechanics. I hope that I maay hiave the opportunity at some other period, and at a more congenal season of the year, whea I will visit Glasgow again, if it be only for -that punrpose. (Cheers.) It would not become me, my Lord Provost, to refer to those writings which have been mnentioned in praise far beyond their deserts. But I con. fess I do feel thankful to youL that you mentioned me a the author of the Coxtinis (cheers) ; because I think it is prinicipally that work which three years ago, first at Edinburgh-which I shall always maost thankefully remember- and recently at Glasgow, attracted the kindly notice of the youths of Scotland, and that because it touchedI a -chord in their own association by its attempt to express the happy influence of domestic affections and parental -virtues. (Cheers.) If ye-sterday in my address to the students of youir college I enlarged somewhat upona the sources of national pride, I trust you wil not believe that I was guilty, on the one hand, of what I conceive to b-e a very poor artifice-seeking to please the audience by a conjimonplace appeal to its vanxity ; nior, on the other hand, that I could, as an Englishiii,n, desire to inculcate a sentiment of geographical bigotry, so as to comifiume the pride of a Scotchmian exclusivEly to hiis native heather, or to nsake him forget thst h,e is also a mnember of this great uniited empire over which ~extends the sceptre of the Britisli monarch. But the Scot. tislh character is a great fact, and in reminding your youLth of that character as their fathers have made and left it, I ,did feel that I did more than I could have done by the precepts of Pllato or the examples of Plutarch, in bringing before their hearts tIme fruits of probity and perseverance, an,d the end( of that honrourable labour which gives success to individuals, and that patriotic sentiment whbich formns the defence of nations. It is by the exercise of those virtues that Glasgow vinidicates her motto,-" Let Glasgow flourisli." I think it is 300 years ago almost-in the year 1.556-that, according to the taxation apportioned to the Royal Scottish bumeghis by Queen Mary, Glasgow was only the 1lthi town in Scotlanid ; and I see by the very interesting -work of Dr. Strang tipois Glarsgow and its Clubs that it is not quite 100 years since the populasion of Glagow very little exceeded 2:5,00 souls. M'e'' ll, what has raised your ,city to its presnt en.inence %3 second only to the vast meteopolis of this united emipire ? The first reason is the xelesse of its energics9 from the thraldom which preceded the Rteformation, and the next is the maode in which these -enet gies have siiice been directed by a glorious league of intellectual culture and moral perseverance-that concord 'of social interests in which each mian is unconoselouLsly a patriot, every thriving citizen adding to the welfare of the community, and every difficulty in natuLre stimulating the invention of the one for the benefit of the many. (Cheers.) And that this patriotism is not a mierely selfish or local sentimenat we have the proof of the bon. and gallant cfficer who addressed us in an earlier part of the evening ; aned if there be a single tow-n in Scotland which may be supposed excusably to have the warmth of the Scottish sentinient of nationality it is this city, wvhich has been exclusively the work of Scottisli hands. That gallant officer tells 7us, and tells us truly, that not only did it give 7,000 recruits to our army-he has itot only done justice to the transport Ahipii which proceeded from the Clyde-but he has also stated trtiiy that there was no town in England, with the exceptioni of London, which contributed so largely as Glasgow 'to the assistance of these arniles which supported the imiperxial majesty of Great Britsin before the wails of Sebastopol. (Cheers.) TIhat alone were sufficient to makce us one great -emnpire, fo*jhe patriotism of the parts is the strength of the whole. It seems to me thab t snaualhreta
thse factory and the mill should flourish side by side With the college, seeing 'with what energy and raPi8ity science has been brought to bear upon all the arts of life. I think it is not gO years since the Clyde could only admit a few lighters from Greenock, from its numerous sandbanks and contracted margins. But now the sandbanks are removed and the margins are -widened, and America, India, and China float their veseels to your barbour, And is noe that r.ver a type of that intelligence iteelf which enriches cities and states, in proportion as we clear the obstructions from its bed and widen the space of its waters? (Cheers.) it brings naturally to Wy mind the name of that poet to whom my Lord Provost has referred as being imy predecessor in the office of Lord Bector-a poet Nvho does equal honour to the college which instructed his genius and to the city which gave him birth-
our to asman, Thomas Campbell (cheers)-that poet ,ho bw'r.so glowingly invoked that right improvement whose M
:: Handmaid, Art, shall every vrild explore,
T 1'race eyer-v wave, and culture every shore."
Will you pardon me if I pause for a momnent to do homage to the nanie of Champbell (Cheers.) I knew -your poet as 4 personal friend. I think I understood that nature which -was so exquisitely sensitive-that heart which was some'what shy of revealing itself to strangern, but -which ould so warnily expand, to all with whom it felt it could interchange its genuine sentimentg. Of al 'whom the studenta of Glasgow ever raised to the ,effice of Lord 1ector I can conceive no one to whom that elevation eould give emotions that so touchingly uaited the prde of triumph with the tenderness of affection (Loud cheers.) I see in the same square which oonta1ns the
statue of Sir Walter Scott the statues of Moore the hero and Watt the philosopher. It seems to me that it is not without a great social effect that your college finds itself in the centre of commerce and of manufacture. The pressura of the atmosphere around it forces its abstraot knowledge into cohesion with the practical interests of mankind. (Cheers.) It was something of that connexion between philosophers and citizens, between sober thinkers and active men, which at Athen. formed the highest development of what the Latin echoolmen, I suppose, mean by the phrase comrnunis 2enmsu. And it is that connexion which is becoming every day a salient feature in the civilization of modern sooiety, for everywbere we see around us that the distinctions which once existed between the learnimg of the schools and the intelligence of the multitude are becoming, not indeed lost-that they never can be-but less and less palpable and rigid. And in proportion as the multitude apply more to books so the schools admit more of the knowledge of mankind. Now, I think that in these conditions of our society collegiate institutions increase in the value which to some they seem to lose, because it is in the interest of all among whom knowledge is diffused jealously to guard those institutions which bring together men who are habitually guardians of the standards of the knowledge actuaUy existing, and the most searching critics of every method by which new knowledge can be added to the old. That you perfectly appreciate that trath is shown by the pride your citizens take in your scholars. I am sure that pride is reciprocal, aud that your scholars are not less proud of the noble citizens of Glasgow. For what scholarship and what poetry more noble or moretouching than the operations of commerce and manufacture? What finer scholarship than that which is learnt attheloom and diffused through the universe by the ship-which translates the darkest riddlesof nature into the luminous characters of art? Wvhat nobler poem than that which is read in the streets of Glasgow -a sma town raised into a great city by the genius of creative labour? I am speaking of the scholarship and the poetry that belong to trade and manufacture. I should have been inclined also to touch upon the necessity of cultivating the fine arts, and giving to the eye and the the taste that education which is necessary to beauty of design in manufacture. It is unnecessary for me to touch upon that, for you, my Lord Provost, were the very person to embody and typify the hberal sentiment of Glasgow in that respect by suggesting to me that it was a good topic to touch upon. WVhen I look around these magnificent rooms, and see the splendid collection that belongs to the corporatn, I can only wish that that collection may continue to increase. I rejoice to hear that there are many citizens who are adding to it, and I have no doubt that in a short time this collection will be one of the chief prides and triumphs of your city. With that connexion between science and artmy wish is, to the last generations "Let Glasgow flourish." Wbile I have the honour to sit in Parliasnent, if ever some measures should be devised by the great body of your townsmen forthe benefit of the city, and submitted to the notice of Parliament, do permit me to join with your own representatives in the cordial support of those interests which identify the wealth of these kingdoms and the fruits of their union with that prosperity which I now call upon you to drink-" Prosperity to the city of Glasgow." (The hon. baronet resumed his seat amid loud cheers.
The LORD PRovosT briefly replied.
The CRourIER, in a neat and brief speech, gave "The Imperial Parliament," and referred in happy terms to the numerous gentlemen present representing both Houses. (Tile toast was drunk with great applause.)
Mr. Cummi.NG BRUcE, MX.P., acknowledged the toast, as being the oldest member present, and took occasion to allude to the undoubted admiration entertained by all parties in the House of Commons for the genius and character of the gentleman whom they were met that evening to honour.
The Earl of ELGIN, who was received with rapturous applause, then rose and said,-It affords me very great pleasure, in obedience to the command of the Lord Provost, to propose to you as a toast, " Our Universities." Before I proceed to the performsance of this duty, I trust that I mnay be allowed to say how highly I appreciate the distinction wlhich has been conferred upon me by the invitation to jOill you in paying this tribute of respect to Sir Edward Balwer Lytton. Unconnected as I am by local ties with Glasgow or its neighbourhood, I owe the privilege of being l,ernniitted to associate myself with the gentlemen of Glasgow in doing honour to one to whom honour is so justly due to the fact that, through the favour of the municipal authorities of§ this great city, my name appears upon the roll of citizens. (Loud cheers.) I can only sayand I aoll happy to say so to :;ir Edward himself-that this circumstance adds, in my opinion, to the value of the distinction, which I will prize above any which it has been my fortusie during5my public career to obtain. (Cheers.) While 1 was listening to that magnificent oration by which we hlave been cllarined and delighted this evening I could not help thinking that the best wish we could form for our distinguished guest wvould be this, that when that period shall arrive when his rectorship shall be a matter of history we may find that in this rooim such a panegyrist has been found for him as has been found for Thomas Campbell. (Loud cheers.) Among thie signs of the times which those who run may read there are, as it appears to me, unmistakeable indications of a growing interest c . the part of the people of thiscounitry inoiur nationaluniversities-agrowingdesirethat they "lay be inall respects equipped and fitted forthe discharge of their high and iioportant functions (cheers)-functions which have been well defined by an able writer to consist in " teaching science, and learning, and art, and literature, to the highest point and to the widest extent, by the most dexterous system of indoctrination." We have been long in the habit, in this country, of boasting-perhaps sometimes a little too freely-of what has been effected in the general intelligence of the people through the instrumentality of parochial schools; and most assuredly I should little envy the feelings of any Scotchman who would be 8low or reluctant to acknowledge the obligation we owe to these admirable institutions. (Loud cheers.) Bat, perhaps, we have not been always sufficiently mindful of the fact, that if the streamn which circulates through the plain is to retain its fertilizing qualities the water at the fountain head must be abundant and pure, and that if the topmost branches of the tree of knowledge wither from lack of nourishment, at some period not renmote, the humbler shoots also will show signs of atrophy. (Cheers.) I consider it a most satisfactory and promising symptom of the times in which we live that the condition of our national universities should be engaging so large a share of public attention. No doubt the question is one which requires intelligent and careful consideration ; and, as is peculiar to topics of public discussion, we may expect occasionally that dubious suggestions will be made, and that even among wise nmen there wvill be difference of opinion. I may, however, say, in the language of Milton, "1 The opinion of any good man is but knowledge in the making." A good man may exaggerate present inconveniences, and may view prospective advantages through a magnifying glass, but these exaggerations will, we may confidently expect, eventuate in the birth of awbolesome, and vigorous, and healthyreforma. tion. If we wvould arrive easily at this most happy consummation, it is indispensable that those who undertake to guide this movement should be discriminating and prudent as well as bold, and that they should not only be conversant with tIle Drinciples of university education and with its practice in other lands, but above all that they should be thoroughly imbued with the spirit of the Scottish academical systein, and sllold reverently retain all the features of that system which are distinctive, national, anid characteristic. (Cheers.) If additions are to be made to our venerable academuical edifice, in order to get at their real advantages, we must be careful that these additions rest upon the old foundations. (Cheers.) What are the features in our existing academical system which, upon the grounds I have mentioned, have especial claims upon our respect and veneration ? I would venture to reply-as the most important-its comprehensiveness, and its eininently popular character. (Cheers.) The universities of Scotland at no period of their history have been, in any sense or term whatever, class institutions. They are and liave been eminently, pre-enlinently, and emphatically, the seminaries of the people of the country, in practice as well as in theory, through the instrumentality of bursaries. One of the miost eminent of our divines obtained his education by means of a bursary. Throngh the agency of bursaries our universities have been open to the sons of the hardy peasantry-to the promising atursni of our parish schools, as well as to the sons of those higher in rank and station. It Inay be said that in this respect the influence of our Scottish universities has been democratical; and the allegation is true in the best sense of the word-in that sense in which it implies that advancement, honour, And distinction are open to aU alike (loud cheers), and that questions of birth and fortune sbaU not prove an insuperable imspediment to prevent those of any rank whom God has gifted with superior talents from cultivating them to the utinost, and employing them to his honour and the good of their country. (Renewed cheering.) If we look a little more closely into the matter, I think we shall find that, on the other hand, these institutions in their consprehensiveness have exerted an influence emnphatically Conserrative, by bringing tIle talent of the land and the knowledge of the land under the influence of the humanizing and noble associatiin of theso time-honoured institutions. They have in this way a niost powerfol effect in producing that national homogeneity which is one of the main sources of our strength and vitality. I trust it wiU not be supposed tbat I wlsh to speak disparagingly of other institutions towards which I have a filial veneration and affection if I say that in this particular our universities present a marked contrast to those of the sister country. 1 observed not long ago that at a public meeting at Huddersfield
a propositin was nade-I presume in consequence of the existence of an acknowledged want-that the mecbanics'institutions of England should assume toacertain extent academical functions, and should hold examinations and give prizes and certificates of merit, possessing to a certain extent about the value of a university distinction. I do not presume to criticize; still less do I venture in any way to condemn this measure. But I cannot help fearing that, if this suggestion be carried out, its logical consequence and result will be that henceforward the intel-
lectual development of England, instead of flowing in one majestic streami-the accordant utterance of many waterswiLl, like those mysterious ocean depths of which science has recently revealed the secrets, be found to consist of onposing currents, moving in different directions wide as t e
poles asunder. Observe what has been the comparative effect of the academical systems upon the ecclesiastical cndition of both countries. On a late visit to England I was told that amnong tie operate classes of that country there wer certain opinions in regard to property which were exceedingl unsound. I was told that these were derived from their religious guides and teachers. When we came to look into the character of theseteachers wve found thatthey were exceedingly ignorant and illiterate; in point of fact, the whole spirit and tone of their teaching differed absolutely and entirely from the spirit and tone of the teaching upon social questions, of the spiritual guides of the classes
immediately above them. In this country we have in abundance-perhaps I should say in excess-religious differences, and if I would be precise I should say that in Scotland here we have in abundance,perhaps in excess, religious distinctions without a difference. (Laughter and
cheers.) We have the established church, the Free Church,
the Bur he" and the anti-Burghers, the New Ligrht, and
the Old Lights, and we may yet have the Blectrso IZghts too. (Laughter,) But, by the universality and comnprefienaleenees of thisour academical system, the pastorss and teachers isf all these denominations receive together a comn-
potent education upon the most important questions affect. ,ng the relations of man to Godand to society. I am ready todo this. Iwould undortake, if our hon. guestw ere to commit himself for an indefinite number of Sabbths to my care, to carry him to these different denominations, and J. will venture to say that, with ill his acuteness aud discrimination,he could not tell me at the end of the time one denomination from another. We come to the conclusion, and I shall be borno out in the fact, that if we have Socialists and Communists in this country, without almost a solitary exception, they are not connected with one or other of these denominations. Therefore I venture to express the hope that, when we undertake to raise the standard of our academical instruction, to multiply inducements to young men to turn themselves to learning and science, we shall be careful to do nothing to limit the influence of the academical system. I feel that I am trespassing upon your time, but I have only entered upon the portal of this subject. I must say, with all respect, that it appears to mne that there is a kind of incongruity in regard to discussions upon a subject like this by post-prandial speakers, who are bound in conscience to remember that the audience are inddentally affected with thirst as well as with weariness. I will conclude by saying that it appears to me to be a most fortunate circutmstance that, at this critical period in our university system, when questions so vitally affecting the welfare of our universities are likely to come under discussion both before the public antd in Parliament, we have the I flice of the Lord Rector filled by one whose opinions on these subjects, when they come under discussion, will be of the utmost weight. I cannot help saying that if -we consider in whose hands the election of the Lord Rector is vested, and ite admirable choice made on this and on other occasions, there is here some argument, at least valwt qucantum, in favour of the maintenance to its present extent of the popular element in our universities. (Loud and protracted cheering.)
Dr. HULn responded to the toast in an effective seh.
Sir A. ALISON, in some graceful observations which were well received, then proposed "1 The Fine Arts," to which Mr. C. H. Wilson replied, and concluded by a few appropriate remarks upon the connexion subsisting between the fie arts and the arts of industry.
Sir J. MAXWELL then interpolated, amid much applause, a toast not included in the brief programmen3amely IThe Health of the Chairman," which the Lord Provoats uitably acknowledged.
The next toast was "The Progress of Literature, and Mr. Stirling, M.P.," given by Mr. W. BucnA.wu, who began by disclaiming any intention of dealing in detail with a subject of such magnitude. He expreesed his conviction that in every department of the great round of literature the springs of genius were bursting forth as freshly and vigorously as of yore. After a brief eulogy on the scholastic attainments of the ex-member for Renfrewshire, Colonel Mure, and the ability which had been exhibited by the present member for Perthshire, he concluded by giving the toast, coupled with the name of the latter ger.tleman.
The toast was duly honoured, and the company waited for the rerly of Mr. Stirling, but the Lord Provost apologized for his absence, as he had been obliged to leave by an early train.
Mr. Sheriff BELL gave the toast of "Poetry and the Drama," coupled with the health of Professor Aytoun.
Professor AYToUN was loudly cheered, and delivered an eloquent reply, in the course of which he pronounced Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton the greatest living author in Britai.
Sir M. S. STEwART, in afew complimentary observations, gave " The Health of the Croupier," which Sir James Campbell briefly acknowledged.
Notwithstanding that the list of toasts was exhausted, the LORD PROVOST requested that the company would remain a few minutes. His Lordship then alluded to the cordial feeling subsisting between this country and France, and stated that they had a representative of the latter country present in the person of one of the officers of the French f rigate now in the Clydn. He then gave, as a toast, a sentimnent expressive of cordial union with France, which was received with enthusiastic cheering.
Lieutenant MALNILLE spoke in Frenbh, ap lI for hiis niot being able to express himself in English. He amlluded to the number of English naval officers whom he had met in various ports of Great Britain, and declared himself highly pleased with the warm feelings of fraternity which hiad beeni uniformly interchanged.. He hoped that the et2n1ev cordiale would be for ever preserved between France and England, as affording a security to the weaker Powers, and the best guarantee of the peace of Europe.
The company then retired to the West-room, where they partook of coffee, after which they gradually dispersed.
Premium On Gold In France.
PREBMIUAI ON GOLD IN F2BANaB.
TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TI3MES.
Sir,-I beg to offer the following explanation as probably more intelligible to "Digger," " Dunce," and Co. than those which appeared in your issue of the 12th of January:-
Required the meaning of "Gold in Paris is 6 per mille premium ; the exchange at short is 25 17L. Therefore gold is about 6-lOths per cent. dearer in Paris than in London."
At par (that is, calculating the quantity of pure gold in a certain weight of French gold coin against a similar weight of English gold coin) 11. = 2517 francs. This multiplied by *006 (6 per mille) is 0151 franc; and, as gold is at a premium in Paris, this 0 151 is to be added to the par valte 25-17, making the exchange value 11. = 25-32 francs. Bat bills of short date on London only allow 25175 francs, and the difference between that and 25 32 is 0-145 franc. Now, *145 is 1-174th (or 00575) of the par value 2517, which shows that gold in France is 1-174th, or 5Z per mile, or nearly 6-10ths per cent. dearer in France than in England.
As there may be in the preceding example some confadion to "Digger," "Dance," and Co. between the 6 per mille premium, and the resulting 6 per mine by which gold is dearer in Paris than in London, I will add another example, to show that it does not follow because one is 6 per mine the other is 6 per miUe. In this (the following) example the premium is 30 per miUe, and the percentage of dearness 21 or 23.1 per mille.
On the 22d of March, 1848, The Times' Money Article stated that "Gold in France is 30 per mine premium, and the exchange, in bills of short date on London, 26 50f.
The par value, i.e. 11. = 2517f. remains always the same. This multiplied by 03 (30 per mile) is *775; and 27-17 + *755 = 253925f. The difference between this rate
*575
and that allowed in short bills is 575f.; and - = 0235;
25-17
showing that gold was then 23M per mile, or rather above 2& per cent. dearer in Paris than in London.
The calculation by which the par of gold is ascertained to be " 11. = 25 17f.," is founded on thefollowing data:-
I. English standard gold (i.e., that of our gold coinage) is 22 carats fine, or 91i pure gold in 100 parts. II. French standard gold has a " touch" of 900, or only 90 pure gold in 100 parts. III. A kilogramme (1,000 grammes) of standard French gold is coined into 155 Napoleons, equivalent to 3,100 francs; but a kilogramme of English standard gold would be worth 3151-30 francs, inasmuch as there is so much pure gold in it. (CompareL. andIl.) IV. One ounce troy (480 grains) is equal to 31-1 grammes, at 15-433 grains to the gramme. V. The "Mint price" of standard gold in England is 3t. 17s. 10Ad., simply because one pound troy is coined into 44A guineas, which is 934As., and 934. diviled by 12 (the number of ounces to a troy pound) is 77-875, or 77s. 10Ad.
The calculation from the above data, by what is called the "chain rule," which is a series of proportions combined is as follows:-
1. Required the valne
in francs for 11... = 20 shillings
2. 77-875 shilli-gs ... = l oz. troy of gold

I would add a few remarks as to the calculations given by your three correspondents in your issue of the 12th of January. The data given by Mr. Cruse and the result of his calculation are correct; but he has included 1,000 on one aide and 1,006 on the opposite side of the"chain,',
. hich have no place there, inasmuch as these elementshave nothing to do with the calculation to obtain the par of gold. Secondly, there is no necessity for making two dinision sums where one (as I have put it) is sufficient.
The explanation offered by your second correspondent would not be more intelligible to " Digger," " Dunce," and Co. than the original article in The Times which puzzled them; and one would suppose that "H . J. P. D." did not understand it himself. The errors committed in the calculation quoted by your third correspondent are-lst, the assumption that 2515 francs is the par for 11., whereas itis 25-17; and, 2dly, the division of -60 by 26-50, the short bill exchange, instead of dividing it by 2517, the par rate, to obtain the percentage by which gold is dearer in Paris than in London.
I have preferred to use the decimal notation of the franc, and write 25-32 francs, instead of 25 francs 32 centimes, and -145 franc instead of 14.A centimes.
Your obedient servant.

DEATii OF THE RIGHT REV. DR. GRANT.-We regret to have to announce the death of the Right Rev. Dr. Grant, Roman Catholic Bishop of St, George's, Southwark, which melancholy event occurred on Thursday night, the 1lth inst., at St. George's. Dr. Grant was consecrated Bishop in the chapel of the English College at Rome, of which he had been for some time rector, by his late Eminence Cardinal Franzoni, on the 6th of July, 1851. The deceased prelate was olty 40 year of age at the time of his decease, which took place rather siddenly. Dr. Grant had been suffering for some time from lung disoase, accompanied with diaease of the heart. On the morning of the loth he felt unable to rise, axad his phymician, Dr. Hamilton Roe, wa summoned. The remedies presoribed afforded no relief, and towards evening he gradually sank, until 10 o'clock, when he calmly expired, after having received all the last rites of the Church from the Very Rev. Dr. Doyle.
Modern Attire And Its Accessories.
i MODERN ATTIRE AND ITS ACCOSSOPJES.
TO THE EbDITOR OF THE TIsE3.
Sir,-I have long nourished an ardent desire to addresi you on a subject fraught with pain and deep anxiety.
An abuse is daily growing around us, or rather round our wives and daughters, whichhas hitherto saccesasfullyresisted both the taunts of thesatirists and the utilitarian influenoss of the age. Need I allude to the prevailing fashion of ladies' dresses, which, in form, in material, and in expease, daily exhibit symptoms of a fatal development?
Many conflicting considerations have hitherto restrainel me from any attempt to enlist your sympathies on the side f, virtue and of husbands. The close of the last season gave me hopes of amnadment. Baxt the summer fashions running with a rapidity almost imperceptible through the various gradations of autumn attire, and blooming suddenly into a vast expanse of -winter velvets, awakened me to my delusion. The velvets purchased, cut out, and assmed, the coup de stain alone acquainted me with the conspiracy while it disarmed me by success. But, Sir, I am no longer to be trifled with. I am not a man easily daunted. Patiently have I waited the appointed time. With forbearance, at certain seasons, verging on despair, have I watched the increasing amplitade, and paid with trembling hands the increasing bills.
Often, Sir, at baU or crowded assembly have I been tripped by the confluence of massive tissues. Often have I been suddenly and painfully compressed in a doorway by the framework of a creature whom nature had intended for a fairy. Nay, Sir, more than once have I, without a murmur, submitted during a pelting rain to banishment from my own carriage, constracted originally for the conveyance of four persons, but now, forsooth, not capable of one elderly and two youthful ladies, hedged in their shells like the clapper of a bell.
But there is a limit to endurance. The appointed moment is at length arrived. Christmas-day is passed. The new year is no longer a stranger. Twelfth-night monarchs have abdicated their functions. Parliament has not yet assembled. During the interregnum I may be allowed to court your powverful assistance, as the old garments are be. coming faded, and before the moment shall arrive for the conception, and, alas ! the purchase of new habiliments.
Certain social disorders demand stringent remedies. By your hand alone can they be duly administered. The age is not suited for sumptuary laws; but by exposing the secrets of onerespectable gentleman's household, lot me hope to lead my fellow-countrywomen to a sense of what is due to themselves and to their family exchequer.
The ladies of my family are subscribers to a detestable publication, illustrated by highly coloured prints, a weekly record of the ephemeral fashions. From a number of this periodical I am enabled to gather a general idea of the manner in which ladies find it feasible to lavish the sub. stance of their kindred on personal adornment. And, first, as to the question of quality, you may expect a catalogue of silks, velvets and laces. You will scarcely believe that those sumptuous textures are no longer sufflcient to bedeck their daintiness to advantage.
The fabrics of Lyons and Genoa are unequal to the task unless loaded with the most minute and costly embroidery and fringes. Even those beautiful laces, which hitherto have delighted the eye not only of the coquette but of the artist, must now be overlaid with adventitious, and I may say meretricious, ornamnent. The hair, once considered worthily adorned with jewels, permanent in their nature and of convertible value, must needs caU in the aid of giltpowder and flowers, requiring in their close and delicate imitation of nature the costly skil of the most cunning workmen. These of course lose their freshness after the wear of a few evenings. And when I tell you, Sir, that the flowers of one dress alone have been known to stand the purchaser in a sum of not less than 1401. you wiU agree with me that such expenditure is little less than a crime even in the wealthiest of our wealthy nation. Nay, jewelry is no longer admissible in its natural and permanent character. Silver and gold, emeralds and diamonds, are no longer attractive, unless surrounded by artistic settings of no intrinsic worth, the perisbable beauty of which in a short time leaves no trace behind beyond the bill of some courteous but insidious goldsmith.
So much for quality. Allow me a few words on the subject of quantity.
T'he present exaggeration of feminine redundancy is not an abuse of contemporary origin. In 1745 it was already pubHcly denounced in a pamphlet entitled " The Enormous Abomination of the Hoop-Petticoat, as the Fashion now is." Many now living can remember the hoop as a necessary component, of a Court dress. This fashion was ex. ploded, not, I think, until the death of Queea Charlotte.
But since that period it has recurred, like an epidemic, at certain intervals. About 15 years ago it prevailed to an extent almost equal to the present mania. I recollect two French. statuettes which much assisted in suppressing the absurdity. One lady arrayed in bulkygarments was represented as guarded by spikes, such as are employed to prevent little boys from travellinggratuitously on the footboard of a carriage. Another lady, neglecting this precaution, Stepped stately, while affording to a successful urchin the luxury of a journey dos-d-dos.
Drapery was subsequently reduced to more reasonable dimensions. The skirts, neither too scanty nor too full, feU in natural folds, exhibiting the graces of a good figure, and not thrusting into prominence the faults of a form less elegantly shaped. Bat lately, Sir, the old leaven has been at work, as we all know to our distress and tribulation. That curious preparation of horsehair, known under the classical denomination of crinoline, is now deemed inadequate to the duties of expansion, unless fortified with quaint instruments of steel and tubes of caoutchouc infiated by belows. The result has been the enormous accumulation of breadths, as evidenced by "bill delivered." The evil is greatly on the increase. Women of all shades and sizes are yielding to the fascination. Beauty seems to be valued like aCrown land, only by the amount of square feet inclosed.
It is to the French Court that we are indebted for this iuexplicable and ruinous infatuation. France has ever been supreme in matters of female costume. We on this side the Channel have generally dictated the form, hue' and material of masculine attire.
And France is now attaining a height of luxury not sur passed even in the most luxurious times of her history. It is a bad sign. The reign of Louis XV., with the same cha. racteristies, was the precursor of sad events. I am not disposed to draw a comparison. Save in this respect none exists. Bat in the present state of society any approach even in such matters to a former period universaUy reprobated is injudicious and impolitic. Nevertheless, for the French there are paUiatives not feasible, let us hope, in this country. It is well known that the lionnes of Paris do not disdain to borrow their costly plumes from the dressmaker. The boastedluxury of ever-changing dresses does not betoken ownership. The hire is paid by the value of the advertisement.
But should our neighbours think fit to adopt this peculiar garb, why should we servilely folow fashions sapportabla only in a nation the manners, liveliness, and conversation of which are so essentiaUy different from our own? These swoUen dresses surely cannot add to the attractions of our fair countrywomen. With our other allies, the Turks size is an essential element of female loveliness. We, how ever, do not measure that quality by the same standard of proportions.
General slimness, with certain local developments, used to present to us, as to the ancients, models to elicit and to inspire our admiration. Now-a-days, instead of a form of natural grace, we are called upon to commend the semblance of chronic elephantiasis.
AUow me to caU the attention of our countrywomen to one fact which I think wiU give them food for salutary reflection. The hoop, I have always heard, was devised and introduced to conceal the symptoms of a state in which " ladies wish to be who love their lords," by some ladies not endowed with the same concentration of tenderness. If the mothers and daughters of England will bear in mind this fact, they will, perhaps, be more anxious to ia-
crease their wvsdom and curtail their circumference.
I will not say a word of milliners " coughing their own knell" in the manufacture of these garments. I will not refer to the letter of " Verbena," published last year, com-
plaining of want of space in the presence of her Sovereign. These considerations have been urged often, ably, and in vair. Let me, however, conclude my letter by replying to a fallUay often adduced in my home circle.
A daughter of mine, an interesting child, but afflicted with a strangely perverted gift of political economy, ondeavours to answer my remonstrances and to lay a flattering unction to her soul by the assertion of the benefits accraing to trade from the increased expenditure on articles of attire. To this I have a ready answer. And I will inform her Sir, and others labouring under the same delusion, that the benefit conferred on trade by waste and extravagance is but an unhealthy and transitory impetus which, by ruining the customer, will ere long involve the rain of the vendor.
Many instances in sunport of this view hvve lately beea brought before my personal knowledge. Wives have covertlycontrateddebts to the detriment of theirhusbands. Daughtershave run up bills withoutthe knowledge of their parents, vaguely truting to marTiage as a mees of extrication from their difficultieg. Meanwhile the pur-
veyors, often womenof small apital, fearing to enforce theirclaims, and cursing the day wrhich bas introduced them to a "Weest-end conneion," seek in bankruptoy the only resene from aoarvation.
Such are the moral and political effects of exess ia c ennoline. I am. Sir. T ours falt.hfn1l.

There has been mere seasonable weather, and farmiog work is goIng on as well as could be wished. ' The young wheat leeks exceedlgly well, but a seasonable check is what is wantedI now. The vast qu%atity of rain that has recently fallen has rendered the heavy soilsm more difficult to work.

The weather has been variable, a good deal of rain has fallen and the low lands have been Iloxdod, and farming work has proceeded with a slight itotsruption. The bracing temperature of the middle of the week was favourable for wvheat thrashing, hut many damp and indtfferent samples have froni time to time been offered at theo local mark-ets. 1Hetwithstanding the changeable weather, which in by no means favourable for the young wheata, the plant is looking well, and having reseived a check will be all the better for it. Severe weather is still wanted to keep) it from getting too forward. Food for cattle is Plentiful, but prices are lagla,
Fat stock Is usascered in price. At Sleaforel fair, writh a tolerable supply of beasts, the trade ruled dull, and late rates wvere with dimli culty maintaised. At Newark, withi a fair show of beasts, beef realised 7., d. to 85. Sheep were rather scace,and muttonrsold at 6(dto 7(d.

There are still alternations of mild and frosty weather. in sonie parts of this district copious showers of rain have fallen and the lowlands are occasionally flooded. The wheat plant presents a Promising appearance generally.
The wheat trade at the local markets has been, on the whole, inanii. mate, Inferior kinds have receded in value to the extent of Is. to 2s., owing to the little inquiry made for them. The begt dry qualities hire generally mainta-ined their former value; but, although the demand has chiefly run upon those qualities, holders have not been able to obtain more money, any disposition to advance prices hiavIng imomediately checked the sales. Malting barley has undergone a further Improvement of Is. to Is., but the deosaind has been less Active during the latter part of theoweek, and for the present the uPward movement eetas to have been arrsted. Oats and beans hive commanded mome attention ; quotations have been in some cases slightly raised, and there in altogether a better tone In the trade.
At to-day's market there was aver an Average supply of farmere' wheat, though not quite so much as last week, and the conclition was somewhat better. Holders consenting at the outset to acempt last wQeeks prices for the best samples, and a seduction of 6d. to Is. per load (Is. 4d. to Is4. 8d., per qunrirer), on inferior descriptions a pretty good clesm-ac was nuiSele on thosesternms. Theme was a liberal show of barley ; malting samples were not easy to sell, and grinding earts slightly declined sn value,. The trade in oats and beans wa, momo active, but without producuis,. ay alteration in the generad l curenies. The following are the quotatlions:-'New wheat.

RIOCHEiSTER, JAr. 17.
Considerable variation has been oxperienced In the weather during the past week, the days being for the moet part mild, whUe the nights haTe been frosty. Much rain has also faUen, and the ground appears to be thoroughly saturated, the dnU damp weathor being anything but favourable to tho Crain. A. ffue open and frosty atmosphere In much neoded to faciiitate thrashing and farming operations generaly. The young wheats continue to look promising, and do not appear to have boen in any degre affected by the late frosts and the copi<us rain. IXt nearly al kinds of stock for cattlo there appeara to be abundance, though we have heard complaints mado that twnpo show signsof disease; but it does not appear to be general.
There ras a good attendauoe of farmers and milers at the corm market, and a fairsuppry of all kindsof grain, but the trade was rather dai andpurebasore eridently cautious in effecting transactions. There waa no perceptible dfference in thb price of grain from lst week's quotations, the beet sorts of white wheat on offer ranging from 70s. to 75s. ; momofair samples of red whelsteiagat i0s. to6h. Barly remainol 1rcm, that for grinding purposes being quoted at 36s. to 39s.; roliting ditto, 41s. to48g.; somefirst-rato samplesraUzingla. The trade in this article was dult. Oats were Is. les, and rangoe from 22. to 25i. In other kinds of grain there was a good supply. Msaagan beans, 36 i. to Ms. ; ditto old, 40 ; now tick beans, very flue, 40a. to 42s. ; old ditto. 425. to 45s.; gray peas, 37a. to 39s.
At Maldetono market on Thursday there was but a imited stpply, especially in wheat, aud only a few salos effected. Prices were nominally the samo:-Whise whoat, 66e. to 70se; red wheat, t0,6 to 63os.; mailting barley, 44a. to 48s.; grinding ditto, 363. to 40s. ; oats, 23I. to 28g.: beans, Mte. to 45s. At Canterburr there was a poor supply, and that for the most part in bad condition :-White wheat, 65s. to MOs.; red wheat, 63s.; barley, SU. to 50a.; orats, 22a to 24s, At Sandwich market on the Ilth]new white wheat, frous 6ie. to 70s. ; new red ditto, fSa. to 64s.; barley, 40a. to 46s.; oats, Yis, to 2ls.; beans, 42a. to G6s.

Election Intelligence.
ELECTION INTBLrIcanRvtN
'P. A cRTTcQ?vT
* Mr. Frewin, one of the present representatives, having publicly announced to the electors of the eastern division of the county of Sussex that it i8 not his intention to solicit their 8nffrages at the next election, Viscount Pevensey has just issued an address, in wrhich he states he intends to offer
"As his Conservative successor, believing that the political principeBs which he be,d, and Ialso am oready so aavocate, aro notonly those meest oondincive to the welfare of this Kret empire, bunt aleo thlose which are supported by the great majority of tho electors of this divieion."
Lord Pevensey in his address adds
To enter upoa political details at any length woull, at this moment. be undoubWtedy muisplaced and premature, consiaering the theo likely to elapse before yon will be callerd upon to choose Your representative; but I cannot refrain from eaying that no one wvho leaves a question of such vitai nationsal importance as the Al%ynooth gusni au openi question-who does not plodge himaself at once and unhesitatinily to use his best endeavours to obtain the repeal of thiat grant-ought to claim the honour of representing your opinions, Whicih are all bat unanimous oni that point, in the couscils of a Protestant nation. lReligiously and politicaly that grant is indefensible. I amn o bigot. I abbor intolerance, but Idraw a wide distinction between perfect freedom of religioua opiuion and the direct support of the Catholic church by a Protestart Governmment I hope to see, long before I solicit youir suifrages, the repeal of the; hop duty and tho rcluction of thesncoame-tax. The one ia iniurlus and oppressive, the otber ill-levied and worse principled, etsentially a war tax, Yet contiueft in peace, and, as a peace tax, teemiug with injustice. It is vith the greater coueidenco that I appeal to yoa for support, because I feel that the settlement and remoteness of those commercial questions which, at th_ last election, adversely intfWn,ed many of those whowe opinions were otherwise inherently Conservative wil now permit them to rally round their old standards, aud, by an overwhelhing majority, once more-aud I hope for some years to rome-stamp this division of the county with its true and last_ gConservative character. On general principles, too. I appeal further to those who are Liberal' only because they faucy that a Coaservative policy is one of obstruction and retrogression. It is bigh time an idea so abaurd sbould be dispelled. Legitimate reduc. tion of taxation, withoit draining the Tressury-oconomy, without impoverisbing the force aud vigour of the nation-equitable arrangeme.t of questions relative to tae Church, withoutdisturbitgit futndamental inBtstutson1s-aeijUbtmient of electoral privileges, wvithout extending them to classes not yet prpared to receive thenm-a padeat progress ol legislation, without the spasu odle violence of radical mueastxres-a strict and loyal adherence to the fist principles of the constitution, without being blind to its defects-these are Conservative prin ciples, but yet they are nelther obtruictive nor retrograde. Tshese are principles whicn I advocate, and which you, each and all, may support: the Liberal without being too Conservative, and the Conwervative Without beiNg Liberal; while, however, on the other hand, these rational viewa and principles are far too gentle and too limited to be advocated by my luture opponenut, who solicits sour suifrages reb3 ing solely and exclusive,ly asto claim to youir elupport uPon the expansive, indednite, and infinite title and characterof a Liberal-a tiLtle whieb, while it must effectually preclude him from all hspe of Conservative support. does net deserve the suffmage, of tho3d enlight. ened electors who desire a just, equal, and smparcial legislation for all classce, Conservative as well as Liberal."
Mr. John George Dodson, of Hurstpierpoint, who was an unsuccessful candidate at the last election, has again come forward on the Liberal interest. As a contest, therefore, apRears unavoidable, it is not improbable that the reprosen-
tatton of East 8ussex will again be disputed with considerable interest.
DUMFRIESSHIRS.
In all probability there wiU be no contest for the repre. sentation of Dainfriesshire, rendered vacant by the elevation of Lord Drumlanrig to the Marquisate of Queensberry. Various gentlemen have been named in connexion with the subject-Sir J. H. Maxwell, of Springkell; Colonel Grahamn, of Mossknowe; Mr. Hope Johnstone, of Annandale (who formerly sat for the county), and others; but it is almost certain that none of these gentlemen will enter the lists, and that Lord Henry Scott
second son of the Duko of Buccleuch, witl be returned without opposition. This young nobleman is at present in Egypt, havng gone to the East for the purpose of recruiting his health. A meeting of Conservative electors was held at Danfries yesterday for the purpose of promoting the election of Lord henry Scott. Mr. Leny, of Dalswinton, convenor (or chairman) of the county, presided, and stated that the great object of the meeting was to take measures for securing the election of Lord Henry. The chairman then read a letter from the Earl of Dalkeith (the Duke of Buccleuch's eldest son), explaining that Lord henry Scott's political opinions are similar to those of himself on aU general subjects, and that he is firmly attached to, and is prepared to uphold, the Protestant institutions of the country; that fromi having been hitherto obliged to spend much of his time abroad he may not have been able to study so closely as he could have wished what may be called immediate local matters, but he has had opp ortunities of becoming acquainted with the interests of ths country in some of its most important colonies and dependencies-an advantage which has seldom fallen to thelot of a person of his ae. He is certain, however, that Lard Henry would mnake'himself acqulainted with all such matters as might demand his attention or he intrnsted to him in Parliament.
On the motion of Mr. L.traRE, of Maxwelton, seconded by Ar. H. AJRUNDELL, of Barjarg, it was unanimously resolved by the meeting:-
"That under existing circamstances Lord Heury Scott appers t) be the most proper person to represent this county in PariUament; sod this meeting Pledges itself to use every exertion to secure bis return at tbe ensuing election."
It vas also agreed to issue an address to the electors of the county, signed by Mr. Leny, intimating tho resolu tion come to by the meeting, inviting snpport to it, and stalin' that arrangements wvould be immediately proceded with for the purpose of canvass3iog the constituency on behalf of publdIshdnr. An address of this nature hasaccordinglybeen

Sir,-I was ono of tho passengers on board the unfortunate steamer '.lyne, wrecked on her voyage home from Brazil, and I beg you will kindly give a place in your columns to the following statement of the treatment I and a fellow-passenger experienced at Radley's Hotel, Southampton7
We arrived there a little before 12 o'clock at night on tho 13th inst., half-frozen and soaked to the skin; we were told we could have no warm food excoept tea (of which I do not so much complain), but they actually refused us any brandy, because at vwas against the rule to furnish anything from the bar after 12 o'clock; and we must have gone with. out what was, in our condition. an absolute necessary, had it not been for the kindness of a gentleman (Mr. Cardon), who went out and procured some from another place.

London, Monday, January 19, 1857.
LON-DON, MONDAY, JANUARY 19, 1857.
A few weeks ago the British public were generally under the inmpression that tne closing year had been remarkable rather for the conclusion of a great enterpifse than for the beginning of a new one. The occasion was deeidQdIy pacific, and people were thrown upon their imagination, for events big enough and strange enough to startle and stir us during the ensuing twelvemonth. Could we, then, suppose that aL ordinary EngUishman
had access to some future history of his country, we ean imagine how dlow he would be to recognize his own times in such a passage as the following :-" The latter part of the "year 1850 witnessed the commencement of "an enterprise which for adventurous character
and colossal results has scarcely a parallel in the "history of the world. The stream of conquest "had hitlherto flowed, with few exceptions, from "the West to the East, and the conquerors had "generally been the hardy sons of the mountain
and the forest,-the conquered those whom a "more genial lot had bred to the pursuits and "habits of peace. Hence a long prescription had "abated the wonder with which men had once "regarded the progress of ALExANDER through a "hundred nations to the confines of India, the "conquests of GENoHIS KirMN, of TAUnmRANx, or "NADIR SHAH, an(d those of MAMIOUD and BADER, "who, starting from Central Asia itself, still, as "if by instinct, turned their faces to the East. "In this year, however, England, which regarded
no prescription and followed no law, armed the "soft Hindoo and the enervated Mahomedan "-who had ceased to rule over him for an "undertaking that should reverse all the prece"dents we have alluded to. Starting from that "new world whieh the Macedonian had pined for, " and crossing the Indus from its eastern shore, "they entered the terrible passes of Affghanistan "and emerged upon the confines of Persia "for the coercion or subjugation of that " fickle Power. At the same time the "Indian Ocean was eovered with a vast arma"ment destined for the invasion of Persia on "its more accessible maritime frontier. The " continual progress of the British arms in the " East forbade the supposition that any one object,
any one frontier or territory, was the final "purpose of this expedition. Its chief pretence "was then found in the aggressive arms and "diplomacy of Russia, who was ever supposed to "seek in Asia that expanion denied her by the "solid phalanx of military Powers in the West. "Thus, a progress of a thousand miles
over mountains and deserts was made for the express purpose of encountering, at that distance "from home, in his own region, a foe whose "rapacity and strength were the very excuse for the "undertaking. W7hat added to its audacity was, "that only a few years before a British army "had been destroyed in its retreat through "the passes by which another now advanced, and "though, witlh vast effort -and cost, the national "honour had been retrieved, yet al the world had "supposed England too wise to run the risk of " another such catastrophe. However, before the "end of the year 1856 Persia found herself "attacked at once by land and by sea." We wiU not ourselves dive into the future, easy as it is to imagine the immense consequences of both these operations. We will only ask whether the English generally-whether one in ten thousand was aware last Christmas-day that not only British fleets, but British armies, were rapidly advancing upon Persia, perhaps in actual collision, and that it was not too much to say matters were in a train for the conquest and annexation of that ancient dominion?
The naval armament is on the largest scale that could be afforded out of the resources imnmediately at the command of the Indian Government. There can be no doubt of its formidable character, and the celerity with which it was prepared and despatched speaks well for the energy of the Indian Administration. The last portion of the fleet anchored off Muscat on the 19th of November; it was to rendezvous in a few days at Bunder Abbas, in the Persian Gulf, and as early as the 17th of December the authorities at Bombay were daily expecting to hear of the fall of Bushire. As extensive preparations are stated to have been made for our reception, it is not improbable that on last Christmas-day, when we were dreaming only of peace and goodwill, the Persian Gulf had been for a whole month the scene of sanguinary hostilities between HER MAJS.TY and the SHAH. The last tidings of the expedition were eight weeks reaching this country, rid Bombay; and it adds considerably to the anxious character of this war that it will be the middle of March before we hear what we are doing or suffering in the nearest, and easiest, and most accessible part of it, on our own element; and that, in the event of failure, by the elements or otherwise, it must be June at least before any assistance whatever can arrive from this country.
Let us turn our eyes northward, to the mountains of Central Asia. On the 21st of November Brigadier CHAMBERLAIN, with about 5,000 efficient men, 'was only six marches from Cabul. This fact stands out in bold relief from the mass of rumours and conjectures with which the Indian papers are filled. Eveiything there, whether it relates to the Alfghan or the British movements, is a matter of speculation, so mysterious is the political atmo3phere of those regions. If the British public knows nothing, whether at home or in Ind;a, the armies, the natives, the chiefs themselves equally move in the dark. We enter Cabul, but whether to pass on to Herat, or to garrison the c-ty of Cabul and leave the Ameer free for the protection of his family interests against the Persians, or to secure him against disrsnsions in his own territory, no one can say. The Affghans themselves know not whetVer to regard us as friends or as foes, for at least one mountain tribe has disputed our progress. The sanguine British authorities assume that we are commencing a permanent occupation of Affghanistan; but they are also fully aware that DOST MAuomoED and his fellow-chiefs will do anything rather than suffer this, and that Persia and Russia have only to make a slight move in their diplomacy, and the necessity which now drives the Affghans into our alliance will no longer exist. Supposing the utmost present success, both to arms and negotiation, there is no doubt that we must push on more troops and more still. It is a question of reinforcements, and accordingly the new regiments arriviDg at Peshaw ar are retained, and those already there are not relievcd. Ten thousand men are asked froma Bengal, and there is
a cry for more men, and of course, too, more money, froin England. We can imagine, from our old lesson in Cabul, as well as our more recent experience of the Crimea, what it will cost to maintain ten or twenty thousand men in that country against the Persians on the frontier and even in the interior, against the antipathy of the native tribes, against the jealousv of the Ameer, the rivalry of the chiefs, and the ruggedness of nature itself. How are we to be repaid ? It is a population of soldiers, all of them rather accustomed to levy black mail than to pay it. It is not the first campaign or the first year that brings such questions to an issue, it is the third or fourth. Bence the old saying, that our troubles would only begin with the successful occupation of Cabul. That occupation, however, is no longer a problematical or probable affair. There can be little doubt that by Christwas-day Cabul was substantially and effectually in British occupation, and that we had returned to the state of affairs we thought it wise to abandon a few years ago.
It is vain to advise when the thing is done. No doubt these twin expeditions have been surrounded 'with this secrecy for the very purpose of anticipating discussion. So, as usual, we wake and find ourselves conquerors. The great British people has no more to do in the question than the igno-
rant and slavish population of the rankest despot. What is worse, our Legislature, our atatesmen, our soldiers, our Orientalists, have nothing to do with it. Neither the conscience nor the mind of the nation is admitted to a voice in the decision. Prudence and the experience of much disaster had suggested that such countries as Affghanistan were the natural boundaries and defencea of empire, and that it was at least a saving of everything to wait for the distant and still future enemy after his passage over half a continent than meet him halfway. Persia itself is more than half desert, and we can never effectually grasp it or retain its good offices without an extensive occupation. Yet the SnA himself, such is his country and such the wild tribes that form his nominal empire, has never yet been able to establiwh order or compel entire submission. His only policy with his own subjects is the lowest order of diplomacy. It is a region which never has been held together, where ALEXANDER'S dominion fell to pieces os soon as the breath was out of his body, and where every city, every tribe, every man is constantly occupied in making his own terms with every chief, confederate, or people, alike with friend or foe. The British genius never can be naturalized to such a climate. Even through the Indian medium it can never be subtle and various enough. And this is the border region in which we are now about to fight the long battle of another Indian empire!
Our friends the advocates of popular education
Our friends the advocates of popular education must not be angry with us if we oceasionally check the impetus of their argument and interpose a caution. We are bound to watch them as we do all other public agitators, not because we do not sympathize with their cause-far from it-but because the best of causes is apt to gather commonplaces around it, which people repeat by rote without proper qualification, and without really examining what grounds they have for such wide statements. Not that we object to commonplaces, they are good in their way, and every large cause must have them, only they must be watched, otherwise they run into emptiness, or rather become positive untruths. This is aU we have done on the edacation question. MIr. MO.NcTON MiNzs, in his speech at Halifax, charges us with totally denying the tendency of education to diminish crime; al that we said, however, was that facts were not as yet sufficiently clear on the subject to justify us in appealing to this as a known truth, and resting on it as the principal ground of exertion in the cause of education.
What are the facts before us? The upper classes in this and other countries have for a long time had education, and what is the result in a moral point of view? We do not say that it is not favourable; but would any one think of propounding it as a self-evident truth, which it was paradoxical to disbelieve, that education prevented vice in the upper classes ? Let us begin with what is not vice itself, but what grows into vice if it goes on un-watched, with the simple irregularities of boys and young men at school and college. A person might say beforehand that education would subdue and tame irregularities. But does it, as a matter of fact? Do not a certain proportion of mi'mds come out of the process very little tamed, and issue from the machine of art and discipline with a good d~eal of the wild man about them ? These primordial features of human nature are not so cowed by centuries of upper class schooling, but they come out in a certain proportion of every successive generation, and play aU sorts of pranks, and prudent fathers, fond mothers, and faithful tutors groan over the desperate pickle or unmanageable youth who wil knock his head against brick walls. Before we come to actual vice, then, and while we have only comparatively innocent excesses and irregularities before us, we are warned of the existence of something inl human nature which, whether we caU it a relic of the savage state or not, resists the mould of art and education, and exhibits a strong aboriginal, abnormalife. But something far worse than this meets us further on. Are the reckless sensualists, the gamblers, the men who plunge wildly inlo the abysses of debt, men without education ? They are constantly men of the very best education, men who have had the very last fnishing touch of the moulding hand, men of large information, elegant tastes, and bigh accomplishments. But the process which refined them on the surface could not control the force of passion, and subduethe inordinate, insatiable, and lawless element in them, which drove them on from one form of excitement to another, till it landed them on that criminal excess which corresponds to what is technically called crime in the lower classes.
If this spectacle of the combination of education and criminal excess is presented to us in the upper classes of society, what possible reason have we to suppose that it wil be at aU different in the lower? It is easy to say that a poor man wil not seek the coarse excitement of crime when the treasures and the charms of knowledge are opened to him. But do not people see that exactly the same thing may be said of the upper classes ? Why should a man seek the miserable, degrading, excitement of gambling, when he has DThTr, MiL=No, and LA PLtcx to read ; when he can contemplate nature in the pages of WO31DSWORTHE; when he can meditate on infinity in the philosophy of LOCKE and DEScARTEs ? How can a man be guilty of such bad taste? This is what our believers in the panacea of education would say beforehand. But the fact confutes them; the man likes dice better than science or epic poetry, and why should it not be just the same in the poorer classes? Vhen you have laid open the book of nature and art before them, there wiU stiU be a certain proportion who wil like burglary and larceny better than hard work, and will value the key of the bullion chest a great deal more than the key of knowledge. Men who make speeches about education learn at last to talk about it as the ancients talked about philosophy. Education is the infallible elevator, refiner, guide, consoler, soother, corrector of the human mind; when she comes upon the stage the clouds of error vanish, the sky clears, human infirmity disappears, and health returns to diseased and disordered human nature. But we find out, when the time comes, that aU this was only what education should do, what antecedent reasoning made it perfectly certain she would do. What she does is a different matter.
Education is a most powerful developer of human nature ; it is an engine which, when applied to the mind of man, has the effect of bringing out all its resources and capacities,-tastes, affections, passions,-all its elements, moral and intellectual. Apply this powerful engine, then, to human nature, and can you pretend to say that you make it work exactly as you please, make it do what you like and omit what you like, bring out all the gcod in human nature aud none at all of the bad, develop.e the useful element and leave the noxious alone altogether I Education introduces the mind into another region, it opens fields of thought of which the man had no idea before, autd it places him in a new world. Timue; but is not this world composed of rather mixed material? Is there no line of thought and reflection opened out in this new mine which tends to make the man discontented with his position, and so prepare him for crime ? Are
all the facts to which history introduces us soothing ones? Are all the exemplars of history saints? Is there not in this new world of thoughts and facts a great deal to agitate as well as instruct, and exasperate as well as amuse ? If there is we must not talk about education without remembering that it has a rough as well as a mooth side, and that it brings out evil as well as good. What is our whole large department of literature but one continuous and very mixed appeal to human passion, and so a most powerful exciter and developer of that passion? Let us take this mighty engine, then, with its grand operations as facts represent it, and not expect that we can tame it down into an exact subservienev to our own objects, or reduce it to a domestic article of furniture. The president of an agricultural dinner at which P&Lxy was present lectured the company on the discovery of a new kind of oileake, which not only fattened the beast, but laid the fat on whatever parts the owner wanted. The company were engaged in various efforts to explain how such a convenient result could be obtained and arrive at a solution of the enigma of the self-arranging oileake, when PAixy cut the knot by a very simple observation, 'which did not lose in effect from the broad Yorkshire in which it 'was conveyed-" It's a loie, Mr. "I PREsIrDmT, and that's the solution of it." The ideal education which some of our good friends proclaim and offer to the world is to act upon human nature in the same way that this convenient agricultural discovery did upon the animal-to develope what parts of it the teacher likes, and pass over what he dislikes.
Let nobody suppose, however, that if it is at all doubtful 'what the effect of education is with respect to the diminution of crime, therefore the question of the extension of education is at all a doubtful one. We are bound to bring out the resources of human nature, and to open the intellectual treasury which lies shut up in the mind of the human race. That is a task which PROVIDENCE plainly lays upon us, and whe'her the result is purely good, or whether it is good and evil mixed, it must be done, and it can only be done by promoting educatior. The opportgmity of mental growth and enlargeirent may be neglected by some and abused by others, but it is no less our duty to give it.
The columns of our last impression reported the
The columns of our last impression reported the trial and conviction of LEopoLD REDPATH for frauds committed upon the Great Northern Railway Company, in the service of which he was engaged. The interest attaching to this case has naturally been very great, but it is comprised itself within a small compass, while the purely technical character of its details deprives it of those features which gave so impressive an effect to the trials we hame recently recorded. REDPATu was originally a clerk in the registration department of the company, but for the last three yeats has had the chief managemen' of the transfer business, in which crpacities, through the medium of the share-market and by the aid of certain processes, which we shall not detail, he succeeded in fraudulently appropriating to his own use very large sums of money. There was little difficulty in establishing the case for the prosecution; the jury took only a few minutes for deliberation, and returned their verdict of Guilty without having quitted the box. We should not be doing much for the edification of our readers if we were to enlarge upon the particular means by which the frauds in question were eccomplished, but the case itself is such, in more than one respect, as to deserve attentive remark.
We invite consideration, in the first place, to the circumstances under which these delinquencies were carried on, and to the detects of system by which they were rendered practicable. No doubt, the whole subject of railway management may still be regarded as in its infancy, nor is it reasonable to expect that aU the financial departments of enterprises at once so gi,antic and so novel could be administered with anything like a perfection of system on so short an experience. It is to be observed, howvever, in the present case that the deceptions practised appear to have been by no means elaborate ; in fact, they became trans parent the very instant inquiry was set on foot. Not for a moment did REDPATHr rely on deluding his employers when once those employers thought that something was wrong. As soon as ever the books were asked for the culprit gave up the game and absconded. But is it not an inevitable inference from facts like these that if supervision and inquiryhad been unremitting'y exercised in the regular course of administra ion, instead of being exceptionally instituted as misgiving arose, the mischief might never have occurred ? Look at the circumstances of the first charge adduced against the prisoner at the trial. He stocd accused of forging and uttering a forged deed of transfer, No. 3,623. The first false ent-y with respect to this stock contained a reference under the form of the initials " 0. B." to a certain " old " book," but as soon as the old book was examined it was found that no such account existed as was referred to in the new one. Look, again, at the date. The transfer in question was made on May the 7th, 1852, so that more than four years elapsed before the discovery of a fraud so discoverable, and the malpractices reached to such an extent that, from this case and its depositions alone, as many as twenty forgeries came to light, involving frauds to the amount of 20,0001. or 40,0001. We cannot but think that some improvement of systsm-such, in fact, as numerous correspondents have suggested-might be applied so as greatly to abridge liabilities like these.
Our next point involves a question of a very different kind. It has been observed with regard to the example before us, and not in this case alone, that the style of living maintained by RiEL PATH was such as should have suggested to his employers, who knew the amount of his salary, some suspicion as to the source of his means. Mlaking all abatement for the exaggerations which the occasion was sure te produce, it certainly appears that REDPATH was in this respect a man of some mark ; and the questions on this point to which Mr. 3IoNvATT, the secretary of the company, was subjected in cross-examination seem to have had reference to the impressionalluded to. We must say, however, that we lay but little stress upon the point. It is by no means certain-especially in a place like London-that the habits of one member of an association would be known to another; indeed. Mr. MOwVATr pointedly disclaimed aU such information in the case before us. " REDit rP-T1," said he, " was living in very good style "-I believe at Regent's Park, but I know no " more about it than you, Sir." Moreover, it would hardly consist with the manners and customs of this country that the authorities of any establishment should hold thenmselves under obligation to scrutinize the domestic economy of the persons wlhom they employ. Sound principles of business would require rather that an effective system of checks should always and in all cuses be maintaired than that a aystem of managementi leaving openings to fraud should be supported by inferences irawn fror the independent habits of those concerned. The conclusion that things are either right or wrong should be founded en the ascertained state of the accounts and the lalance, a(ter which clerks and their saLaries might be ]eft-to tlhemselves.
Onemore observation, and we have done. After regent disclosures, it is scarcely possible to tscape
an apprehension that the morality of society in the present day is sadly debased and degraded below the standard of earlier and simpler times. Natural, however, as is the first occurrence of such a reflection, we are persuaded that it is unsound, and that in tWs respect, as we remarked the other day, we are in reality better, and not worse, than our forefathers. The difference between the two periods lies not so much in the intensity of crime as in the extent of its opportunities. Such great' robberies as we now hear of did not occur in former days, because there was no such plimder to be obtained. There were then np joint-stock companies, with enormous revenues represented by countless numbers of transferable shares, just as there were no occasions on which thousands upon thousands of pounds were transmitted by ordinary conveyances from one place to anotber. No comrade of JowAT&RA WiLD ever carried off 12,0001. worth of gold, buat that was not because thieves were more scrupulous, but because no such prize was to be had. The tendency of our age towards magnifying and maltiplying has shown itself in criminal as well as other pursuits. Robbers have now their firms, their capital, their division of labour, and their distribution of profits, like honest traders, not as being more intrinsicaly depraved, but as adapting the scale of their operations to the dimensions of their crimes. A culprit formerly emnbezzled 501., he now appropriates 5,0001.; not that he is more vieious or more reckless, but because he has greater power of theft at his command. All things are on a larger scale than in past days, offences included; but we do not conceive that the departure from honesty involves a less Etruggle or is more readily adopted in these days than those. The most salutary resolution would be to bring the system of precautions up to the mark of all other things. Already we have our detector locks and our fire-proof safes, ard we should think that a machinery of corresponding excellence might be devised for the protection of property on the side from which REDPATH attacked it. Of course, urder ary system there would be very great temptation,perhaps some necessity to fall back upon personal confidence, and it is equally natural that this confidence should be sometimes misplaced. Men working together cannot be for ever treating each other as rogues in posse, but it seems only reasonable to bolieve that the share bus-iess of a large company m;ght be placed under such regulations as greatly to curtail, if not altogether to abolish, opportunities of systematic fraud.
We have received a communication on the part
We have received a communication on the part of tie w-dow of the late Mr. Jo%sFpH HAYDx, whose Dic.ionary of Dates and Book of Dignities will be so well known to many of our readers. The position in which this lady has been left by the death of her Irusband is so distreseing, and her husband's claims as a lebourer iu literature are so undeniable, that it would be hard indeed to reconcile the merits of the case with its realities. Mlr. HAYDN'S publications were exactly of that Soit which are more frequently consulted than comrlimented. Under the humble aspect of industrious compilations they make, it is true, but litile figure by the side of the mors pretentious productions displayed in all the luxury of " library " editions" upon the sbelves of the rich and the learned. They are not, however, on tbis account either the less useful or the less used, and we should rejoice to sce the practical valae of such unattractive labours now recogr;zed in the consideration extended to the forlorn representative of one who so serviceably parsued them. The pension which Mr. HAYDx reccived from Gove.imeu, has been continued to his widow, but 251. per annuma is no very adequate provision for a lady and three children, nor is it, we think, a measure of the obligations under which the unobtrusive but useful studies of NIr. HAYDN have placed a large class of readers.

The Murder Of The Archbishop Of Paris.
THE MURDER OF THE ARCH-
BISHOP OF PARIS.
(FROM OUR OWN CORRlESPONDENT.-
PARIS, SATURDAY, JAN. 17, 6 P.m.
This day Vorger appeared before the Court of Assize of Paris to take his trial for tho murder of the Archbishop of Paris. It is hardly necessary to say that the proceedings excited much interest. The impression produced by the death of the Prelate, the circumstances in which the crimo was perpetrated, the station and sacred character of the victim, the charactor of tho criminal-aU contributed to increase the intensity of interest. Before 8 'clock this morning every approach to the Palais de Justice was thronged with people of every class anxious to get in. The iron gates of the exterior were closed, and it was with the utmost difficulty that those who came provided with tickets could make their way through the multitude.
The interior of the building was full to the utmost before 9 o'clock-not a place was vacant. The leading members of the rnagistracy, of the bar, many of the diplomatic corps, of the Senate, the Legislative corps, and the Conncil of State were present; also several high functionaries and foreigners of distinction. Among the witnesses were M. Surat, vicar capitular, who accompanied the Archbishop when he received the blow, and who was the first to keep back tho murderer; the Abb6 Cattoli, the secretary, whowas by hisside atthesame moment; theAbbe Dufour, vicar of St. Etienne-du-mont; M. Legrand, cur6 of St. Germain de L'Auxerrois; M. Be aufils, canon; the Abbo Humnele, the Abb6 Millard, &c. The Abb6s Gue'ti and Verwant were present as witnesses for the defence, havingbeen summoned by the prisoner.
On the table of the court were deposited tho piecs de conviction-namely, the sacerdotal ornaments worn by the Archbishop at the moment. The stole, the surplice, the cope, the soutane displayed the rent made by the knife of tho assassin, ana were covered over and stiff with blood. The blade of the knife was also blood-stained for more than half its length. It is a formidable weapon; a Catalan knife, about 1S inches long, with a blade of about 10 inches, and an inch and a-half wide. At the extremity of the back of the blade, at the part where the double edges curve to the point, is a sort of slit like the cut of a writing-pen, supposod to be for the purpose of facilitating the effusion of blood, or rendering the blow fatal. The vie w of these objectb produced a thrill of horror in the crowd.
The prisoner was brought into court at 20 minutes to 10 o'clock. He is 30 years of age, but looks younger. He is of middle stature, and fair in complexion. His features are regular and expressivo. His forehead is high, though not broad. On the back of his head might be seen the clerical tonsure, 'where the hair is shaved off to about the circumference of a five-franc piece. The prisonor was entirely dressed in black. He 'was led in by the gendarmes, and advanced to the place Assigned him w;th perfect selfpossession, holding in one hand a bundle of papers. He did not appear in the slightest degreo intimidated, and he looked about on the crowd before and under him with the utmost calmness. He stooped down for a moment to whisper something into the car of his advocate, and then began to eonverse with the gendarnme who was at his left. A captain of gendarmery and a lieutenant of the Paris Guard were with the guards stationed near the prisoner.
At half-past 10 o'clock the jury took their places, and the judges their seats on the bench. The judges were 51i. Dolangle, Bonniet de Salignac (who presided), and bf. Degueranvillier. The official prosecutors were BE. Vaisse, procureur g6n6ral, and Md. Barbier, avocat g6n6ral. M. Nogent de Saint Laurens had been named by the Court counsel for the prisoner, and took his place by his side.
After some preliminary proceedings the interi-ogatoire, or examination of the prisoner by the Court, commenced. The Judge asked the prisoner his name. He replied, in a firm voice, " Jean Louis Verger."
"Your profession?" "Ecclesiastic." "Your age "
Thirty years."
"Where were you born 7"
"At Nenilly-sar-Sbine (close to Paris)."
"Where was your last place of residence 7"
"At mny brother's house in Paris, Rae-de-Seine, 56."
The jurors then took the oaths, and the clerk, or greffier of the court, being called on by the presiding judge, commenoed reading the acte 'accumiatiou, or indictment.
The first part of the acte raccvsation contains nothing more than the particulars of the crime, with which you are already acquainted. It then gives some account of the prisoner's previoas career. He was born, as is already said, at Neuilly, near Paris, on the 20th of August, 1826. At the age of 14 he was adnitted, through the charitablo interference of the superior of the Sisters of lNeuUly, to a seminary in the Itue St. Nicholas du Chardonet. The registers of the house contain an entry, dated 1844, from which it would appear that he had been sent from the establishment " for a fault in which his probity was concerned." After having spent some years in a private eatsblishmnent, he entered the large ecolesiastical seminary of Meaux. He was ordained priest at 23, and served in several rural parishes of the diocess. He was even then remarked for the restlessness, vanity, and ambition which form the principal traits in his character.
In 1852 Verger returned to Paris, where he was sure of soon reaching a brilliant destiny. He obtained temporary permission to say mass, and, on the s.ame recommendation which had, in 1841, introduced him to the first seminary, the Abbe Legrand, parish priest of St. Germain l'Auxerrois, consented to attach him to his church as super. numerary. Verger spent three years at the church of St. Germain l'Auxerrois. On first entering he was embarrassed with debt. lr. Legrand advanced him 800f. to assist in paying his creditors, and kindly gave him a room in the presbytery. Verger accepted the benefits, but, finding that his hopes of rapid promotion were not realized as speedily
as he wished, he turned against his benefactor, and began to' whisper the most odious calumnies against him.
In August, 15J5, his diocesan deprived him of his powrers as a clergyman, and he was consequently obliged to quit the parish of St. Germain l'Auxerrois. He spent some months in Paris after that occurrence. From day to day he wearied the Archbishop and the judicial authorities with his complaints And his accusations Against the parish priest of St. Germain 1'Auxerrois, and incessantly menaced this last with some great scanudal nless he readmitted him to the church with an income to bo fixed by himself. Out of compasion for the state n 'which Verger was, the Archbishop of Paris interceded in his favour with theBishop of Meaux, who still continuedtobe his ecclesiastical teriorA letter of the Bishop of Meaurx was attached to thN1dlct.
rnent, bearing date the iOth of February, 1836. It spc-oifies that, out of consideration for the Archbishop, Verger would be recalled to the diocess. On the 12th of March foUowing he was recalled, and Was appointed as assistant in the parish of Secrrs.
New scandal2, however, aoon brought on him further severities. At the- tommencemer.t of Deoember, 1856, the Bishop of Mieaux pronounced * sentence of interdiction on the accused.. This measure asa announced to hi(n by a letters die&d.December 12, iX wich a friendly feeling is stillexaemssed. Another ietter from the Bishop of Meanx to th-& chhbisebop of ljNm6 sws that the interdiction w*a
founded on 'h-ee cad-es:-L The publication of a libel oa - decree of the Court of Amsize at Melun. 2. Sermons preaohed by Verger in the parish confided to his care against 'the dogma of the Immaculate Conception. 3. The dig'covery of a written pamphlet, entitled Tewtamet, filled 'With violent attacks on the dogmas of religion and Against the dignity of eeclesiastical discipline. Verger appears to bave quitted Serris to comne to Paris on the 25th of December, 1S56. He pretends that he came to ask the Archbishop to remove the interdiction pronounced against him by the Bishop of Meaux He adds that the idea of revenging himself by a crime entered his mind on the 26th of December, the day when a witness who was in coinmuni. Cation with the Archbishop told Verger that AL Sibour would not remove the interdiction, or even listen to his defence. The witness alluded to is Mf. Legentil, who has been examined. It appears from his evidence that he ex pressed to the accused his personal opinion on the justice -of the interdiction. It does not appear that he told Verger -that the Archbislhop had condemned him and refused to listen to him. However that may be, Verger himself declares that from that moment he entertained in -sis heart the plan of an atroc:ous revenge; the idea of an assassination was, moreover, familiar to hsim. He related in one of his interrogatories that last year, after he had been dismissed from Saint Germain 1'Auxerrois hie had purchased a hatchet with which to murder first the Archbishop and next the Abbe Legrand. Latterly he was armed with a dreadful weapon, a long Catalan knife, of w-*h he made .so fatal a use, and which he says he pur-chbed two months since for his personal defence. The death ,of the Archbishop was determined. Verger has accomplished his execrable design, and he has repeated the details with a traniquillity which announces at the same time the -ost cool and cruel determinetion. Re takes care in his interrogatories to declare that he was perfectly master of ihimself and that "he knew well what he was doing." He gives a proof of it when he says that on Clhistmas-dav, when he went to the church of St. Severin to hear the parish priest preach; he returned in 'the afternoon to vespers, and gave the priest a snmmaary of his sermon, with his own remarks on it. On the 3d of January, the day of the crime, Verger went at 2 o'clock to +he church of St. Etienne du Mont, carrying with him his Catalan knife. He first consulted the list of the ceremonies 'fr the day, he then placed himself near a bench with the intention of stliking the Archbishop when he should enter -to hear the sermon; but afterwards, when he reflected that smany of the priests had been his fellow-students, and might, -on recognizing him, prevent tho execution of his plan, he quitted the bench and placed himnself in the nave at the spotpreviously indicated. Hewas therewhen the Archbishop -arrived, and remained there during the entire ceremony. At iength he opened the knife, hiding it from every eye until his victim approached. " I did not strike twice," said the prisoner, " for I was certain that the first blow had taken effect."
If in presence of those facts and this language there could -still exist any doubt of the long premeditated intention which directed the arm of the assassia, and of the penal re. sponsibility which should fall on him, some of the documents seized both at his former residence in Paris and at his 'brother's where he was residing at the time of his crime, -will cast on these questions the clearest as well as the most -melancholy light.
On the day of his crime, and with a perfect knowledge of its consequences, Verger wrote a will, in which he left everythinig to his brother, giving bim the full power of receiving anything that might be sent to him during the month of January, 18.57.
To that proof of a perfect tranquillity of mnind just before -committing such a great crime we must add another proo -of the long preparations which the murderer made use of for his detestble act, abandoning the idea of it and taking it up again from time to time according as circumstances seemed to agree with his plans. On the 31st of Janaary, 186G, Verger wrote and signed a note which his been found aniong his papers. That day had probably been fLxed by him for the assassination of the Archbishop, wbich only took place nearly a year afterwards. The note ends thus:-" Alone I have prepared and put into execution the -murderof the Archbishop." When interrogated by the magistrate Verger answered,-" That note has been written by me. It is very trae that last year, when I was plunged into the greatest snisery, I determined to assassinate Monseigneur. I gave up that idea when I hoped to be replaced -at Meaux; but it came again to my mind, and I put it into execution after I had been interdicted by the Bishop of Meaux, when poverty came again upon me, -and that I was told that the Archbishop of Paris would even not listen to me."
Consequently John Louiis Verger is accused, on the 3d of January, 1g;7, of having committed a wilful and premedi. tated murder on the person of Mfarie Dominique Auguste
Sibour Archbishop of Paris, a crime mentioned in articlel 302 of the Penal Code.
When the indictment wmas ead thePresidentof the Court informed the prisoner that he was accused of the crime of Assassination v-ith premeditation, and that he should now hear the charges brought against bins. The names of the| witnesses for the prosecution, 20 in number, were then i -caUed, and as each answered to his name he withdrew to the room set apart for them. Two -aitnesses only were
caUed for the prisoner-Mademoiselle Blanchard, shop- i keeper, and the Abbe Gaett6.
The prisoner was ordered to stand up. He inquired of the President whether he could make an observation to the Court and thejury before the examination commenced? The Presi. dent informned him he was at liberty to do so. The prisoner then began in a solemn and emphatic tone the following words,-" It is now 19 centuries since a serious word was 'prononmced by a man-more than a man-it was Christ, the -man-God. He said ' Paxr bis, pax oviniws.' Another man whom you love, whom yoa all venerate, whom I love and -venerate, hassaid 'L'Empirec'cstlayaix.' Now, whatare we to understand by these words? What are we-"
The Presidenthereinterruptihg him said, this was his de. fence; his defence should come after the hearing of the 'witnesses. The prisoner cont5nued in the same strain for some time. He complained of his not having been able while in prison to procure the "elements of his defence." Hle had given in a list of 60 witnesses, but the Advocate-General only allowed one. There were two sorts of proofs-written and moral proofs-and he wished to have both. Some explanation then took place between the President and the -counsel for the prisoner. The latter said that the prisoner had shown a list of 60 names, but had not sent them to him. The Attorney-General stated that the list was in fact a tissue of the most abominable libels.
The prisoner at this part got greatly e xcited, and shouted out "Read, read, read, read!"
The Presidentrecommended him to calm himself. After some further consultation the judges retired to deliberate on the list of witnesses, and on their return to Court an. noanced that the f&cts on which the evidence of those witnesses was to he given had no relation whatever to the cbarge for which the prisoner was before the Court, and they consequently ordered the proceedings to go on.
The prisoner was again ordered to stand up. He refused. ideclared he should not give au answer to any question, and protested against the moral violence used against him. The President then ordered the witnesses for the prosecution to be caUed. The conduct of the prisoner was throughout of -the most violent kind. He repeatedly interrupted the pro. ceedings, and disregarded all calls to order, as weU as the prayer of his own counsel to be moderate.
Verger having repeitedly interrupted the Attorney. General, and having declared that he would not permit him to continue, the Attorney-General read the articles relating -to the expulsion of a prisoner who disturbs the court. He concluded by demanding the expulsion of Verger.
Vrerger.-I caro not for you. I care for nobody but Jesus Christ.
The President.-The Court retires to deliberate. Verger.-Thatis it! Begone with you !
When the judges returned they ordered the gendarmes to remove the prisoner.
Verger.-You yourselves made the difficulty. You ;began. I have done.
Verger was then removed.
At the hour of post yd No,ent-Saint-Laurent was speak. ing in defence of Verger.

LIVERPOOL, JA. 18.
The Royal mail steamship Europa arrived this morning with advices from New York to the 7th inst., $251,740 m specie on freight for Havre, and 2001. for Liverpool. At 1 a.m. this morning the Europa passed the Arabia hence for Boston.
Mr. Bright, the President of the Senate, had resigned his post, in order that he might proceed to Indianopolis to superintend his own affairs; Mr. Mason had been nominated to succeed him. In the House of Representatives avain attempt had been made to report a bill increasing the pay of the officers of the army. Mr. Boyce, democrat, of South Carolina, had given notice of an amendment he intends offering to tEhe Tariff Bill. He proposes that, from and after January, 1857, all goods, wares, merchandise, and other products subject under the existing tariff to pay a duty of 20 p3r cent., shaU continue to be admitted at that rate, and that tea and coffee shaU be included in the same pchedule.
The New York Legislature had proceeded to business, and read the message of Governor King, which extends over nearly four coluruns of the New York Ilerald. The greater portion of it is devotedtolocal details, but the conclusion expresses the policy wvhich he is about to adopt. What that policy was the sentiments and votes in the recent Presidential election of the great majority of the people of that State and the other Free States had pointed out, and he should unreservedly adopt it and abide by it under all circumstances and in every emergency. He said he was the more emphatic on this point because the present incambent of the Presidential chair had stigmatized the conduct in the recent election of large majorities of the people of that State, as well as of other Free States, by unwarrantably imputing to them motives which tbey did not entertain, and aims directly contrary to those they both avowed and strove to promote. In the discussions in the Senate on the President's Mess3ge those statements seemed to have been reccived and treated as true by persons whose position as Senators added weight to their arguments, and he therefore stated the views which the men of the Free States entertained in reference to the great issue that had called down uDon them such extraordinary demonstrations. Tht-y held to all the obligations, &c. of the constitution as understood by its founder, and until recently acquiesced in bythe whole country; and with regard to slavery especially, they heYd that where it existed it was by virtue of the local law alone, but that it neither existed nor was confirmed there nor anywhere by the force and effect of the constitution of the United States. Congress had the power under the constitution to exclude slavery from the territories, and they insisted that it should exercise its power to effect that purpose. The constitutional restriction, until 1808, of the power of Congress to prohibit the slave trade, and the prohibition afterwards of that trade by acts of Congress, constituted one of the compromises of the constitution, which should be firmly insisted upon and for ever maintained inviolate. He blamed the new and unsound construction attempted to be put upon the repeal of the Missouri compro'nise as the cause of the slavery agitation, and stated that it was made to carry slavery wherever it went; and therefore, whenithey resisted that aggressive spirit and the extension of slavery to which it extended, they were acting within the constitution in defence alike of its spirit and letter and in opposition to the fanaticism of slavery. He showed how consistent the State of New York had been as to the repeal of the MNissouri compromise, which the present President of the United States had proiioinced unconstitutional, although it had every sanction of precedent, contemporaneous exposition, unbroken usage, and, up to a recent date, universal consent. He blamed the repeal of the cowpromise for the fearful scenes of violence and wrong in Kansas, and said it was not competent for any portion of the Government, nor all its branches combined, short of an amendmuent of the constitution in the prescribed form, to transfer to others a power confided by the constitution to Congress; and, when the phantom of squatter; sovereignty was set up for an excuse for that abandonment of duty, not only was there treachery to t'e constitution but a mockery of substantial popular so'ereignty, since, in theory. it professed to leave to the inhabitants of the territory the right to govern themselves, while, in fact, the Federal Executije appo&nted all the chief officers, governors, judges, and marshals; and, again, the pretext was to transfer to the first few accidental settlers the right to determine, finally, it might be, the condition of a territory capable of sustaiinct millions, while in fact, as irrefutably establi3hed by the committee of the House of Representatives appointed to inivestigate the troubles in Kansas, the bo.d fide settiers were ousted of the right thus preDended to be conferred upon them. He alluded to the proceeding which occurred in Kansas, hoped that under better counsel law and order would be restored, and submitted to the Assembly the expediency of contributinfg by the appropriation of money to be med in case of need to wards the relief of the destitution and suffering which misgovernment had occasioned in that territory. He eulogized the harmonious working of the institutions in the United States, and prayed that the Almighty might watcbiover and guide them in all their deliberations.

Vidaurri, however, remained true to his egreement, and the good effects of the settlement oZ the difliculty had already been felt on the frontier. Communication had been established with the capital. Confidence was restored, and the prospect of affirs was generaUy in every way improving. The Indiana were committing serious depredations along the upper Rio Grande, on tfe American side, and there were no troops available to be sent against the marauders.
The activity in the New York money-market continued, and the rates were fully maintained. Prime 30 to 60 day bills, 9 per cent. Three to four months ditto, 9 to 9j per cent. SLx months ditto, 10 to 12 psr cent. The bank specie had increased during the week $750,000.

LIVERPOOL, JAW. 17.
The United States' mail steamship Baltic, Comstock commander, arrived this morning from New York, after a prolonged passage, with advices to the 3d inst., 29 passengers, and $66,000 dollars in specie on freight.
In the Senate a resolution had been adopted calling for the correspondence relative to the refusal of the Dutch Minister to testify before the Court in the case of Herbert, who, it will be remembered, shot one of the waiters at an hotel in Washington last spring. The Dutch Government had signified their disapprobation by recalling M. Dubois and transferring him to Copenhagen. Beyond this the proceedings in both Houses of Congress were devoid of interest.
The New Yor) Herald, referring to the throwing up of his commission in the UniUed States' army by Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel Eaton, captain of the 3d Infantry, on the plea that the meagre allowance provided by the Governnent would not enable hun to support his family, expresses an opinion that if such a parsimonious system is continued the army will lose many of its most gallant gentlemen.
The Washington correspondent of the New York Herald states that there is some foundation for a report " that Vanderbilt has despatched an agent to negoliate a loan with Costa Rica of $500,000, provided the funds are used in exterminating WValker from Nicaragua. It is understood that the Administration are aware of the movement, and the object of it is to defeat Walker, that Vanderbilt may get possession of steamboats and otber property which formerly belonged to the old Transit Company, for Marcy informed Vanderbilt when he was here that he could take his property wherever he might find it." This correspondent, we observe, is an adept in spinning "yarns," and we have little doubt that the above report has been issued as a corrective to the dulness of the political season.
The receipts of gold at New York for the year 1856 showed a falling off compared with the previous year of nearly $1,500,000. The amount in 1855 was $41,682,524 against $40,319,929 in 1856. The receipts for the present year are expected to reach from $38,000,000 to $39,000,000.
The number of emigrants who had arrived at New York during the pasQ year was 141,915, being an excess over the preceding year of 5,682. The number of persons who had been destroyed by fire was 183, and the amount of property about $27,000,000. There had been 143 railway accidents, by which 195 persons had lost their lives
and 629 bcen wounded.I
At Halifax, on the 2nd inst., a fire had broken out, at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, in the vast building on the corner of Hollis and Prince streets, extending thence south to the residence of Dr. Allan, crossing Elollis-street, and burning nearly the whole block between that and Granville-street, including St. Matthew's Presbyterian church. 20 buildings were consumed, and 13 partially destroyed. Two entire blocks, from Bedford-row to Barringtonstreet, were gutted. The scene was most desolating. Several persons were seriously injured, but no lives were lost. The estimated los is $100,000.
In the New York money-market, the year had opened witlh a good demrad for and an adequate supply of capital at 9 per cent. for best 60-day notes; 9 to 10 for three to six months' ditto; and I0 to 12 for fair single names. The regular routine of business had been interrupted by the usual holyday on New Yeaf's-day, but the prospect for the spring season was looked upon as full of hope, confidence was fully restored in mereantile circles, and al seemed assured of increased prosperity. The stock-market was very buoyant, and had closed with a rising tendency. In exchange for the Baltic the business was not large, and little was done in banLers' sterling at 8-. per cent. For continental bills the demand was limited. The rates on London were St to 8 2; Paris, 5f. 2lic. to 5f. 1S2c.; -Antwerp, 5f. 17ic. to 5f. 16c.; and Hamburg, 364 to 362. In the cotton-market an advance of one-eighth of a cent had been established, middling being quoted 13c. to 13je. The holyday had eaused dulness in the flour-market, and low grades were 5c. to 10c. lower. The closing was heavy and irregular. Canada and Southern flour was also duU at a similar reduction. Rye flour was dull, but the market steady. Cornmeal steady. The wheat-market was inactive and dull, holders not being disposed to aceept a decline which buyers contended for. Oats were in fair request, and prices steady at 4Gc. to 50c. for State and Western. Beans quiet. For pork the market ruled firm in face of an increased stock, the holders having great confidence in an advance consequent upon the prospect of a deficient hog erop in the West. Beef was firmn,with a steady, good demand, although the stocks had increased considerably. Prime mess quiet. Beef bams steady, with a fair inquiry. Cut meats steady. Bacon sides firm. Lard steady. Butter plentiful and dull. Cheese firm. At Cincinnati the weather had been mild and warm, but the market during the week had been firm and prices well supported. The packing of bacon for the English market was going on most extensively, and an increase of shipments over last year to the extent of 25 per cent. was anticipated. Turpentinewasheldfirmly at $4, and was wanted for export. A ship had been taken up to carry 5,000 barrels to London. Receivers continuled to ship freely. Spirits of turpentine, consequent upon favourable English advices, had experienced a large demand at 47jc. to 48je., with rotail lots at 50c. Cominon rosin steady, and white scarce. Tar very dull, with ample stocks. In iron there was nothing doing, but the atock of Scotch pla and English bars was light. Preights to LiverpooTwere a shade better, with a light business, at 2s. 1id. to 2s. 3d., for flour; 7d. to 8d. for corn; and 5-I16d. to 7-32d. for cotton. To London, 3s. for flour; large parcels of crude turpentine at 3s. 6d.; and spirits of turpentine at 6s. To Glasgow, 2s. 10d. to 3s. for flour, and id. for eotton.

THE BISHOP OF RIPoN.- The confirmation of the election of the Rev. R. Bickersteth, D.D., the newly ap. gointed Bishop vf Ripon, took place at York Cathedral on satarday with the accusto ned ceremonies. The Bishop was acconpanied by the Bishop of Manchester and the Bishop of Carlisle, and many clergymen were present. At the conclusion of service the Proctor (Mr. Sutton) exhibited Her Mtfr:s letters patent assenting to the choice of Dr. Rooert Bickersteth as Bishop of Ripon and prayed the Vicar-General to perform the act of confirmation. This was done in the usnal form. The Bishop elect thcu took the oaths of allegi4nce, supremacy, simony, and canonical obedience, and tbe Vicar-General announced that, by the authority with which he was invested, he confirmed the election of the Rev. Dr. Robeit Bickersteth. A merry peal was rung upon the bells of the cathedral, shortly after the proceedings were terminated, in celebration of the event.

The holydayg have broken up all business in Washington except Cabinet-making, although both hiouses sit for form's sake. The Senate is occupied with the treaty negotiated in London by Mr. Dallas and Lord Clarendon. The debates upon the ratification of treaties are had in "executive session," when the Senate ceases to be a part of the legislative, and becomes an adviser of the executive branch of the Government. The doors are closed, strangers are driven from the gaUeries, as in the House of Commons upon a division, and privileged persons from the floor. The discussions are theoretically secret, but practically they will leak out. And in this case it is known that this treaty is in serious danger of rejection. I understand the objection raised in the Senate to be this-that the United States bind themselves not to give their consent to any other arrangement in Central America between the local States than the one provided for by the treaty. I think " consent " is the word used (if not some equivalent); and upon this word the question of ratification or rejection hinges. I cannot think, notwithstanding the opposition, that the Senate wiiU reject this settle' ment. It is a treaty in which each party gets all it asked for. The United States get everything offered by Mr. Lawrence in the first note opening the negotiations on this subject, in 1849; get also the abandonment of the British claim to Kuatan, and the other islands, which had betterbe sunk in the sea than make serious trouble between the two countries. Great Britain gets the recognition of the Protectorate, the independence of Grey Town, and some guarantee for safety in the transit when the hordes of Filibusters who are openly sailing from Now York and New Orleans in spite of antirecruiting laws, to aid Walker, shaU either be annihilated or get possession of the country.
The HouEe of Representatives have done nothing as yet. The committees are busily at work, and under the Washington Parliamentary system a few nen in committees do the legislation for the country. Next week the taLiff is to be taken up, and it is weU understood on both sides that some mnodification must be made before the close of the session. Notwithstanding the immense appropriations for public buildings (which have made a marble quarry of Wasbington), for new steamers (which have created the Merrimac and her nates), and other extraordinary expenditures, including the purchase of the outstanding Government debentures and scrip at exorbitant premiums, the revenue grows faster than it can be spent, and the plethoric Treasury groans with now accumulations of locked-up gold, which has no equivalent in circulation. All parties concede that some check must be put upon this buoyant prosperity. In my last letter I gave you a general outline of the two schemes before the House. I am inclined to think that the House will adopt neither, but wil make a compromise between the two. The railways are also pressing upon Congress to procure a refunding of the duties paid upon imported railway iron within the past 10 years. This would amount to about $14,000,000, all collected upon English manufactures. Apropos of railway iron, the annual report of the Secretary of the Treasury makes some interesting statements of the growth of this brauchi of industry. The State of Pennsylvania alone manufactured last year 439,186 tons of pig iron, and of finished iron 227,837 tons, of which 127,550 were of nails, rods, and bars, 82,107 of rails, 21,505 of sheets and plate, and 2,675 of hammered bars. This is from only one iron district, yielding about half the annual production of the country. The whole annual production of the United States is now about 1,OuO,00 tons, and the consumption last year was 1,386,000. Thus you will see that the manufacture of the United States is already as large as that of Great Britain was in 1823. In the Philadelphia
aorgt Aneriran I find these statements concerning the iron manufactures of Pennsylvania:
" As the iron business of this State bears something of a fLxed relative proportion to that of the entire countrybeing rather less than one-half,and yet more than two-6fths of the whole-in the absence of specific data touebing the progress of the business iu our State we may form a loose conjecture on this point from what we know of the past hisatory of its priduction in the United States. In the year 1810, the production of iron in the 'United States amounted to 50,000 tons, from which amount it slightly and gradually declined onward to 1820. Between that date and 1840 it increased through almost uniform gradations till it reached 325,010 tons. In this State, however, statistics show that but 100,000 tons were made in that year, although in 1842 the production amounted to 190,000. Throughout the whole country the two years 1840 and 1841 witnessed a decline of nearly 100,000 tons, when the productien began to rise rapidly and steadily till it reached 800,000 tons in 1847 and 1848. In consequence of the pecuniary revulsions and disquietudes of that period the domestic manufacture of iron fell by gradual stages to 500,000 tons in 1853; from which epoch it has again risen at a uniform and rap:d rate, till in 1855, as we have seen, it amounted to 1,000,000 tons, In 1847 the production in our State was 389,350 tons; but it sunk, in 1849, to 253,37O tons. In 1854 it had increased to 424,231 tons, with 201,963 tons of finished iron. The present year, wh:h is just closing, will show an increase over the production of 1855. In these iron works of our State more than 30 milions of moxeyare invested; and more than40,000 men and boys are employedin the two branchesof thebusiness-the makingand the finishing-who represent, it is supposed, a population of nearly 200,000 souls, a very considerable fraction of the whole population."I
The new year opens buoyantly in Wall-street. Interest and dividend payments have been made punctually, and there is a feeling of confidence and strength. Exchange rules lower.
France And England.
FB?ANCP AND ENGLAND.
TO THE EDITOR OF THIE TIMES.
Sir,-The observations of youlr Paris correspondent, in your number of the 6th. on the svstem of " soZt ss.wderf' made use of by the Russians in their interzowrse with the French since the termination of the war, and the success which seems likely to attend their efforts, have struck me as remarkably just and forcible, and I deem these proceedings more worthy of notice as I feel convinced that the late war was never really popular in France, and that it has not in any degree tended to remove that dislike of England which a constant and long a.- quaintance with this country and opportunities of observing the sentiments, especiaDy of its middle and lower classes, not afforded to all my fellowcountrymen, have convinced me exists in the breast of almost every Frenchman. The feelings of the Legitimist and Orleanist parties are too openly and candidly expressed to be doubtful, and I fancy that those who have been enabled to judge accurately the real sentiments of most of the influential partisans of the Bonaparte dynasty will be of opinion that their sympathies are not with England. I have often thought, Sir, that this state of things was well worthy the serious reflection of Englishmen generaUy, and especially of the moneyed and commercial classes, ever ready to join any apeculation set afloat in France, and to pour forth usque ad 7auseam their clumsy adulation of its inhabitants. Your correspondent says,-" Failing to overthrow them by force of arms, Russia tries to subdue by seduction the enemies she found invincible in the field of battle," &c. These observations have recalled to my mind a letter written early in last May by an extremely intelligent French officer from the camp at Sebastopol to a friend in Paris, which was placed in my hands shortly afterit was received here, and which contained the following passage:-
( CYest l 2 Avril queun ordre du jour da Mar6chal r6lissier apprit A PArme d'Orient quo la paix 6tait faite. Dcs le lendemain nos camps 6taient infests d'officiers et de soldats Russes; ce r6giment, surtout, AL cause do

A Legal Accident.
A LEGAZ ACCIDENT.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-The question of the innocent convicted having through your journal been most promptly and properly brought under public attention, I trust you will allow rue to state a caso that came under my observation within the last four years. For obvious reasons I do not wish that the name of the unfortunate victim of "legal accident" should appear, although I send it to you. Mr. T-, a young man of high character, with respectable family connexious, was employed for 12 years in one of the largest firms in the " Manchester line" in the city, the last three of 'which as buyer for the establishment; in that capacity he laid out on an average from 40,0001. to 50,0001. a-year. In the early part of the year 1853 he left town for Manchester by the night mail; on arriving at - station he changed his mind, And determined not to proceed to Mlanchester that night. On leaving the station for the hotel he was stopped by a police officer, who accused him of stealing the carpet bag which be had in his hand; on examination it was found to be the property of another gentleman. He endeavoured to explain that he took it by mistake; but to no purpose. He was searched; his ticket for Manchester was found on him. This fact was considered conclusive evidence that his leaving the train at this intermediate station was done for felonious purposes. Another policeman coming up at the momert at once recognized in the person of Mr. T-a notorious swellmobsman from London, and, jocosely taking the gold watch and chain from my friend's neck, said, " I suppose this is part of the proceeds of your calling." Expostulation on the part of the accused was vain. He declared his innocence and asked for his own bag, but the idea of his possessing such an article was utterly ridiculed, and his request was looked upon as part of the sharper's dodge. After a little further ceremony he was consigned to a cell for the night, to wait his examination. He implored permission to write to his wife, but so great a favour could not be granted.
The accusation, even at this early stage, had done its work. Excitement set in, and in the agony of his distress he conceived the futile design of attempting to escape from the horror of the place he was in and the foulness of the charge. Unfortunately, the attempt was made, and from that moment his fate was sealed. Without being permitted to commeunicate with his friends he was examined before the magistrates and committed to the county gaoL Eight days from this time his wife, 'who was in perfect ignorance of what had happened to her husband, went ia great distress of mind to the city to make inquiries as to his absence, when to her consternation she was told that there was an account in a country newspaper of his having been committed to prison on a charge of robbery. At once she set off to his prison, and, after an interview, proceeded to the magistrate who committed him with a view of having him bailed out, but in vain.
Now, without going into minute detaU of what took place from the time of his wife seeing him in prison to the day of his trial, I shall state that the day for his trial was appointed; the solicitor for the defence had instructions to telegraph to his brother, a gentleman of high character in the city, who, with my unhappy friend's employer, intended to be present at the trial, to speak to character. But the fataity which in the first instance befell him pursued him with unrelenting perseverance. The business of the court, which was calculated to occupy a certain time, was got over much sooner than was at first expected. Poor T - was called upon to plead to thecharge. His counsel, in defence, pointed out to the judge and jury tbe improbability of a man committing such an act who held a position of great trust in society, and whose character for honesty was beyond all question, as he should prove by evidence of the highest respectability. After his address the names of the witnesses for character were caVed, but, as the trial unfortunately took place 24 hours earlier than in the ordinary course was expected, they were not present. The jury, without leaving the box, found him guilty; the judge approved the verdict, ana the poor man 'was sentenced to some years' imprisonment.
It may be asked, whero was the wife all this time? Why was she not present? Wonder not I The day before the trial she gave birth to her sixth child, and from distress of mind 'was not expected to survive the day through. Fever came on, insensibUity foUowed, and for ten days she was uanconscious of everything about her. At the first gleam of retarning sense she inquired of her nurse if John had returned home, evidently alluding to his usual return from business; but memory, like a flash of light. ning, recalled to her his sad position, and she sank back into the state of insensibility from which she appeared to be recovering. I am not indulging in sentiment; I narrate what I saw, Three weeks later her two eldest children were carried off by an attack of scarlet fever; ten days more her infant died. Within three months from that time she received information from the governor of the gaol that her husband was dying, and that she must proceed immediately to him if she wished to see him alive. She entered his wretched cell. There, before her, lay her husband-a helpless, paralyzed old man-an idiot. His hair, which three months before had not a gray hair in it, was now perfectly white. His age, 35 years. Fortunately for him, he knew her not. Her passionate and heart. rending grief, which wrung the hearts of those around, fell dead on his ear; all human sympathies were gone. Reason was rtdely jostled from her seat. He cared not for judge, jury, or policeman, and he gazed unconsciously on the wife of his early and affectionate love and the mothEr of his helpless children. I neednot dwell upon this scene.
After some formalities at the Home-office he was removed toDa private asylum, near London. Hoe was once more a free man, but to wbat purpose ? In a short tine be sank and died.
This was just one of thoso cases in which it is easy to fix 5,uspieion, and next to impossible to remove it. If no two carpet bags were alike; if there were no confusion at a iailway-station on the arrival of a train; no rush for luggage; but, on the contrary, such order that it would be difficult-instead of easy as it is-to make a mistake; if the railway authorities had on their part done their duty, and made proper search and inquiry for T--'s carpet bag, which they would not be. lieve he possessed, but 'which they aftervards found; if they had allowed him to communicate with his friends, so as to give him an opportunity before he was consigned to prison of proving that he was not one of the swell mob, as they rashly and fatally suspected, and if he bad failed to verify the account he gave of himself-then indeed it might be said that there was a caso for a jury. But there was no such case. The man was falsely accused, ismpri. soned,oconvicted, and driven mad.
Would that I could here close this tale of misery. The husband's relations, for reasons which it is for them to account for, and, if they can, justify, thought proper to shun the widow and children of their degraded relative J Two years passed, and the little all she hd-rings, jewelry, and part of her furniture-were comsumed in the support of her helpless children. She sovght employment atone of the houses of business in the city as a blond runner, and aheis now to be found, with a shattered constitution and skeleton form, stitching frm daylight till 12 o'clock at night, to obtain a most miserable and scanty sup. port for her three hpless srviving children. The work, when done, musl be taken to the warehouse; there this gentle suffering creature, delieately nurtured, not lonz since the mistress ofia happy and comfortable home, has to stand for hours to wait her turn, that her work may be ex. amitsed and a fresh supply given to her.

The crew of the steatm frigate Shannon, 51, Cazpain W- Peel, C.B., got out her mainmast on Thursday, and on Friday sho was warped to the jetty at Devonport dc-cyard.
The paddlevheel steamvessel Trident, 3, Comaander Close, from Portsmouth, arrived on Friday at Plymouth, on her passage to the West Coast of Africa.
The crew of the Coastguard training ship Cornwailis, Captain Powell, C.B, wore paid wages at Plymouth- omr Saturday, and she was appoiltod to sail yesterday for ber station at Hull.
The steam storeship Rhadamanthus, Master Commander R. Brown, was taken out of dock at Devonport on Saturday.
The Indus, 78, Captain J. C. D. Hay, having been riggecs and stored, will probably be taken out to-day (Mionday), andc the paddlewheel steamveasel Buzzard, 6, placed in dock for repair.
Letters received at Plymouth from Rio Janeiro, in refer. enco to the collision with the screw steam sloop Crniser, 17, Commander Charles Fellowes, state that the Swedish bark Therese tore away one of the sloop's guns, and damaged her lower rigging, bulwarks, and some spars. The offcer in charge was a midshipman, and it is understood that thecourt of inquiry held on board have, in their communication to the Lords of the Admiralty, censured the captain for giving this duty to a junior offioer on such an important occasion as when nearing so frequented a port as Rio Jbneiro. lad the bark struck the sloop in front both would probably have gone down. The Cruiser and her companions, the gunboats, sailed for China on the 13th of December.
The Amphlon, 36 guns, screw steam frigate, Captain Henry Chads, arrived at the Little Nore (from the North Americas and West India station), last from Portsmouth under pilot charge of Mr. John Milen of Deal, on Saturday last, at 3 p.m. At 4 p.m. the same day she was inspected by Captain Edward P. Halsted. During the time the ship's company were at target practice one of the midship guns on the upper deck on the port slde being fired, a portion of the expended cartridge (it is supposed in consequence of the strong wind blowing into tho main deck ports) lodged upon. a cartridge in the hands of No. 3, James Willis, ordinary seaman, and exploded the cartridgo just at the moment itwas to have been put into the muzzle of the gun on the main deck. The result was that No. 4, Henry Yeatman, ordinary seaman, whose duty it was to sponge the gun after firing, and No. 6, John Autridge, a stoker, whose duty it was to hand the rammer to No. 4, first taking the sponge from him, received injuries by the explosion; No. 3 in hands and face; No. 4 and 6 in their faces. Their injuries, fortunately, are not of a dangerous character. The Amphion left Port Royal on the 11th of December, and. had 35 days' passage to Portsmouth. She is ordered to be paid off there; she will be ready to be paid off in about ten days' time. The usual port order that no offlsers ormen leave the ship, except on duty, previous to her being paid off is being strictly enforced on board this ship. At divisions, yesterday, it was made known on the quarterdeck that pensioners then serving wvould not (if volunteering for any other shipe in active service), be allowed to retain their pensions while in active service.
The Bulldog, 6 guns, paddlewheel steamship, CommanderAlexander C. Gordon, and the Salamander, 6 guns, paddlewheel steamsloop, Commander George J. Mecham, from theNorth Sea, remain in harbour, waiting Admiralty orders for their departure on particular service.
The Hawke, 60 guns, screw steamship, Captain .fames Wilcox, C.B., is progressing with her fitment in the basin at Sheerness. Mtr. Alfred Eaton and Mr. G. G. Duff, mates of this ship, have left on their promotions to be lieutenants.
The Melampus, 42, late storeship, Captain Leopold George Heath, C.B., will shortly be ready to leave the fitting basin at Sheerness.
The Cyclops, 6 gans, paddlewheel steam frigate, is making good her defects and alterations in No. 3 dry dock at. Sheerness.
The new Seamen's Hospital Ship is ordered to beremoved on Thursday from Woolwich to her intended moorings off Greenwich Hospital. The internal arrangements have so far progressed that the extra labourers an& artisans employed tborein were discharged on Saturday. The screen work and appurtenances connected with the. formation of the church (which has been designed with. considerable taste) are still incomplete, and much yet rematrs to be done before the new establishment can be occupied,
The transport shipping department of Woolwrich is ordered by the Lords of the Admiralty to be closed on the 1st. of February next-MIr. Saunders, the superintendent, to be. placed on the list of naval officers on half-pay and tile establishment to be discharged.
Thoefreight ship Priscilla, in the West India Docks,. having been taken up by Government for the conveyance of Ordnance stores to Cape Coast Castle, embarked three tons^ of ammanition on Saturday from the Ordnance Department of Woolwicb Arsenal, and sailed thence for her destination.

Annexation Of The States Of Rajpootana.-
ANSNExATiON oF T=E STATES OF RAJPlA.N?A.- We hear there is not a doubt that the States ef Rajpootan& will be annexed the moment Governmen* can conveniently do so, as orders are out from the Court of Directors dated, so we are informed, the 13th of Xuly, 1856, directing that all the lesser States be annexed to the Government of fndia whenever circumstances will adpib of such s. course. It is supposed by ;iir HenzyLawrence, K.C.B., and the Bon. Mr. Colvin, Lieltenant-Governor of the North-- WVestamsProvinces,thatthose circumstances have arisen, first, from the remonstrance of the Thacoors in conjlnction with the Commiissioner of the King of Nepaul about the taxingof Sodabut lands; secondly, from the pretalance of in. fanticide in the Thacoor States; and thirdly, from the prevalence of Thuggee. The camp of exereise now forming at. Mehidpore is said to have something to do with the con-
templated annexation, and further, that the State. of Odeypore is to be the first of those that will. be swallowed up. The Government of the NorthWestern Provinces think that the States of tajpootana will yield, after the expenses of Govern. ment and cont;ngents have been defcayed, the sum of 32,00,000 rupees per annum, and wiUl give centralization and rniformity to the seven neighbousiug districts of the Company's territories, and plece at tle entire disposal of Government the bravest of the Jiludee wp'-riors, in the~ game manner that the annexation of Oude has placed the. nursery for Mabomedan soldiers inihe graspof Government. The Government, so it is repeted, think it-oontra. to policy to have independent States within 20(hmilesof the seat of Government, and tha,, as th railways of the Jurne.. Valleywere hastening towards prgress, the evil'of jFrisdiction would be severely felt in the action of gwemnment and. the administration of justice. As a salve to tie undoubted right of the Thacoors, the annexers state thato the R.jpoot. ch;efs an honourable competeney would be 6r.preforabje to. the irksome task of governing, especially an the ruleozwere

PARIS, FRIDAY, JAN. 16, 6 P.s.
The foUowing letter, which is published in the Swiss papers, appears to be an amende honorable for the article in the Moisiteur, in which the Swiss Confederation was treated so cavalierly:-
" Place of the Tuileries, 7th January.
"Sir, -Your political letter conmerning the state and the dispositions of Switzerland has given us much pleasure. We have submitted it to His Majesty, and we doubt not he will be well satisfied with the sentiments which, in the name of your countrymen, you express towards the Emperor and France.
" We never had any idea of separating our cause from yours. For us Switzerland is the same as France, and, though we do not entertain the idea of incorporating you politiclly with our empire, we cannot separate your interests from ours. Moreover, the misunderstanding which the first time caused the mediation of the Emperor to be rejected appears to have ceased, and you shall for ever, and at little expense, be rid of the Prussians."
The AIoniteur de, 'Arme publishes some interesting details relative to the country round Bolgrad, supplied by a French officer employed to make topographical surveys in the Danubian provinces. Recent excavations, carefully executed, afford an exact idea of the Roman fortification which bears the name of Trajan's Wall, in Russia called Trojanstiko-wal. The ruins of this gigantic rampart form two lines nearly parallel; the firat, which is nearest the Danube, commences at the liman of the D)niester, between Akermaun and the Black Sea, and joins the extremity of Lake Sasyk at Tatar-Bunar. It then passes the river Yalpuck, above Tabak, and finishes on the left bank of the Prath. Its entire length, in consequence of the numerous curves, is 38 French leagues. The second begains at the Pruth, near the town of Leowa, about 15 leagues from where the first stops. It traverses the two branches of the Yalpuckel and the river Cogilnic, and ends at the Dniester, below Bender and Tiraspol. Its full length is about 25 leagues. The wall, solidly built, was three vards in thickness and two yards hig"h, with a broad ditch outside. The Roman troops were but 10 years executing this work, commenced in the year 105, and finished in 115. The Roman colonies of this province, composed of soldiers and their families, were thus protected from the ineursions of the barbarians, who descended from the plains of the Upper Danube, carrying with them fire and devastation. Much has been said lately of Bolgrad and of the Bulgarian colonies established in Bessarabia. Their history, imperfectly understood, will assist in the perfect comprehension of the resolution adopted by the great Powers at the last Conference of Paris. By the Treaty of Adrianople, signed the 14th of September, 1829, and which closed the war between Russia and Turkey, it was agreed that any of the inhabitants of Roumeia and Bulgaria who should wish to emigrate to the Russian territory might do so. A number of Btulgarian peasants induced by religious motives had compromised themselves for the Russians during the war. They alone availed themselves of the treaty and withdrew into Bessarabia, where lands were allotted to them. The governor of the province organized them into agricultural colonies, which formed a particular district, of which the chief town was Bolgrad. This district was divided into ten cantons, and had ten villages in each canton. The Bulgarians are well skilled in agriculture and in breeding cattle. Many emigrants, however, returned into Turkey, and those who remained under the Russian domination, though prosperous, have not increased in proportion to the ordinary laws of population. The agrictultural colonies at presenit com - prise but 83 villages, of which 75 are inhabited by Bulgarians, and eight by Roumelians, who emigrated at the Treaty of Adrianople. The town of Komrat, ceded to Russia by the last treaty of Paris, is the more proper for its new destination as the capital of the agricultural colonies, inasmuch as it contains large barracks and numerous public building,s. It is reached, moreover, by several good roads, well maintained. The new territory ceded to Russia is situate in the best part of the province, and the most advantageous, except in point of position. The river Yalpuck, which has been likewise much spoken of lately, is formed by the two affluents of the Yalpuckel, vwhich run parallel to each other to the little port of Andreaska, where they meet to form a very shallow stream in summer, but which is navigable in some parts during the great floods. The Yalpuck faUs near Bolgrad into the lake of the same name. Lake Yalpuck is ten leagues in length. In summer it forms merely a vast marsh. It does not communicate directly with the Danube, but by a small canal a verst long, which ends near the port of Ismail. A communication is possible during a part of the year between Bolgrad and the Danube. The Yalpuck flows between two other rivers, which animate and fertilize that country. One is the Pruth, which has attained some celebrity during every war between Russia and Turkey. The other is the Cogpilnic, which takes its source a little above Kischenew, and faUs into Lake Sasyk near Tatar-Bunar. This lake, like Lake Bourna-Sola, is a vast sheet of water situate along the Black Sea between theDanube and the Dniester.

VIENA, JAN. 14.
The balance-sheet of the National Bank for the year 1856 has been published, and on the whole it iB not unsatisfactory. The stock of silver is 87,240, 609fl., and the paper circulation 380,181,085ff. Out of the 50,000 new shares, at 700fi., for the establishment of a mortgage bank, 47,500 have been paid up. The sum received was 33,250,000. ; but, as some of the shares were paid in paper instead of silver, the subscribers had to pay the difference, which amounted to 2,483,154fl. The bank direction announces that a further increase in the stock of specie will take place "without in anyway affecting the revenue of the bank." The meaning of this phrase probably is, that slver has alreadiy been purchased abroad. The least favourable part of the account given bythe direction of the bank is,that only4,751,300fl. out of the above-mentioned 33,250,000 was lent on mortgage, " as satisfactory security was not to be obtained." The fact is, that the statutes of the Mortgage Bank are of such a nature that no one has any chance of obtaining a loan on his property unless it is worth at least three times as much as the sum required. It is also announced that the bank has taken possession of nearly all the domains which were ceded by the State as security for the sum of 152,500,OOfl., which is a part of its debt to the establishment in question.

BERLIN, JAN. 15.
Immediately after the commencement of the new year the weather suddenly changed from almost spring-like mildness to Russian severity; and this winter the Berliners have taken to the pleasures of skating secndutm artem, and in a regular and systematic style. In the large courtyard of a house hitherto dedicated only to the development of the youthful minds of the future beles of Berlin a splendid sheet of ice has been formed by flooding it during the frost, and here instruction in this graceful pastime is given to all applicants of the gentler sex. Not only do the river, the canal, and the lakes in the Thiergarten offer a gratuitous op. portunity for the practice of the " outside edge," the " spread eagle," and other chefs-d'cemvre of the skating art, but the proprietor of Kroll's Gardens has also converted the whole area of his grounds, which would not otherwise be visited at this temperature, into a sheet of ice, broken only by the trees and beds of flowers, from the cups of which after dusk tiny jets of gas come forth and aid in the larger display of the general gas illumination. The ladies have special accommodation provided for putting on and taking off their skates in a room provided for the occasion, whence they can step at once out upon the ice. The gas illumination, the musical accompaniment of a good orchestra to the merry ringing of the skate, and the ample attendance, constitute this attempt a decided success. This, too, would not have been possible without that most benevolent institution, the new Berlin Waterworks.
Some eighty odd sailors of our nation passed through here at the end of last week on their return to England from Cronstadt, where in some instances their ships are icebound, and in others have been wrecked by the action of the ice. They had intrusted themselves to the guidance of a ship's captain, who undertook to frank them to London for 101. a-head as far as the mere expenses of locomotion were concerned, eatables anddrinkables beingexcluded from the bargain. While here 47 of them took it into their heads to indulge in some entertainment which they intended should be at their contractor's expense, and on his refusing to come forward with the needful the host complained to the police, who accordingly laid anembargo on theirpassports. The captain of this self-indulgent crew, finding himself and his other charges detained here by this unexpected misadventure, found it at length expedient to discharge the reckoning and get his interesting charges out of pawn.
A dlistinguished British subject, as we have all hitherto supposed, is just now staying in Berlin, and peiniitting the inhabitants to view his unusual proportions for a consideration-Mr. MIurphy, generally known as the Irish Giant. It appears, however, that Hamburg lays claim to the honour of his nativity, and maintains that he was born in that thriving republic, and rejoices in the name of Morfee.

TURIN, JAN. IL
The Sardinian Cbamber of Deputies sat again yesterday, and, Deputy Buffa having been asked by the President to read the reply to the King's speech which he had been commissioned to draw up, he proceeded to do so from the tribune. It was as follows:-
" Sire,-Never was it so dear to the Deputies of your people to present you their homage, their loyalty, and their affection, as now, when they salute you surrounded by new glories of the army and of its valour, and they see you hold inconitestably in our peninsula, and before Europe, that high position which had been already assigned you in the hearts of all.
"The splendour of your House thus increasing and reinvigoratingthehopesof abetter fateforthe common country, we feel that we can with more ti-nquil spirit continue the difficult work of internal reforms, in which there will be no little comfort in thinking that the grave sacrifices sup. ported with serene constancy by your people begin at las t to attain the desired result.
" And now, preceded by your Majesty, we advance se. curely towards the future, and more than ever confident that in developing with studious assiduity in the new laws the vital principles contained in the Constitution, the more rapid will be the amelioration of the economical conditions of the country, and that the internal prosperity wiM fully correspond with its outward glory."
As the date of the Emperor of Austria's arrival at Milan draws near the stricter has become the vigilance of the police there. The police, it is said, has enrolled a great number of soldiers wvho are on furlough for the last years of their service as special constables. These men are engaged at the rate of 2f. 75c. a-day during His Majesty's stay, and their duty is to go into all the crowded places and report to the regular police (to whom they are distinguishable by a medal or token of some kind) what they see and hear. A duel took place the other day somewhere near the banks of the Ticino between an Austrian officer and a young Milanese named Viola. The cause occurred in the Scala a night or two before. M. Viola, not being pleased with some part of the performance, considered himself entitled to express his disapprobation and did so, whereupon an Austrian officer walkea up to where he was in the pit and ordered him to desist, as I am told, in such an overbearing tone that the Milanese thought himself bound to resent it. The consequence was a meeting, when they fought with sabres, and x. Viola was so severely wounded in the arm that it is feared he must lose it. It has been rather more difficult than usual lately to obtain reliable information from Lombardy in consequence of the rigorous measures of the police to impede correspondence of a political nature between Lombardy and Piedmont. There is good reason to believe, however, that the feelings of the country wgith regard to this Imperial visit remain unchanged, both in the capital and im the provinces.
Letters received from Parma say, that no doubt is now entertained there of the approaching removal of the Austrian garrison, as the General Commanding-General Baumgarten-had received orders of readiness, and towards the middle of next month it is expected they will at lastbewithdrawn,after having been constantly auartered there since 1849, and in cases of state of siege held military possession of the country for six or eight months at a time. The joy of the inhabitants at this anticipated relief from seeing foreign soldiers continually in their streets is said to be intense, but in amilitarypoint of view the change is of small importance, as the Power which holds the fortresses of Mantua and Piacenza must always strategically command Central Italy. The Emperor Francis Joseph, it was expected, would pay a flying visit to the Duchess Regent on his way to visit his kinsfolk at Modena and Florence.

fBefore tMe LORD CTAL mtTnr - --
Tbis was an appeal from Vice-Chancellor Stuart. Johm MCllington, upon the marriage of hbis daughter Jane with Jarsn Chamoers, in the sear 1802, settled 2,0001. uo trusts, after her death and that of her huaband, in favu of their children. 1,0Q01. of the trust fund was to be paid by the settlor to the trustees, and the other 1,0001. was pay able after his death out of his estate. It appeared that John hfilingtonpaid to his son-in-law, James Chambers, two sums of l,O01l0. each, but never paid anything to the trustees. In the year 1817 John Millington ae-tied 5,0001.o
his daughter Jane, *nd the children of her marriage, and' at the same time made his will, whereby, among other things, he recited as followvs:
'Whereas at times I have advanced tomy so John, and to my daughterJane and her husband, in money, stock, and by other means. value to a conaloerable amuount, now, to prevent any quretioa whether such advancemnents were made an intendsd as oan t

James Chambers and his awife were both dead ande plaintiff, William Davis, was married to one of their childrie. It wilas ndertnthese circunmstancies t.hat the bill wFas one-Mth of the trust fund of 2,000l., which, he fontd
became divisible between the children of James and Jane Chambers upon the death of their surviving paren, and prayed that the defendant Mary Chambers, as the repsentative of one of the trustees of the settlement of 1802, might bo decreed to pay the same, as the trustees had been guilty of a breach of trust in not obtaining payment of the 2,0001. froma John Millington, the settlor, or his persDnal representative. The question was, whether the settlemen-, made by John Millington, in 1817, and the provisions in hii wil, were intended in full satisfaction of what was owing by him under the settlement of 1802 ? The Vice-Chancellor held that the plaintiff's claim was not affected by the traniaction of 1817, which was an entirely distinct provision, ani decreed accordingly. From this decision the defendant appealed.- deedta-
Mr. Malins and Mr. W. D. Lewis appeared for the plaintiff, and opcened the case; Mr. Cairns and Air. Hetherington vere for the appeUant.
Mr. IiEwis having repaeds
The LoaD QuANCELLo, delivered judgment, snd said the question was whether the plaintiff, in right of his wife who was one of the five children of James and Jane Chambers, had any claim to a portion of the 2,0001. settled in the year 1802. He would first dispose of the case as it stood in regard to the second l,000l.-namely, that payable on the death of John Millington. Now, could the trustees have sued the executors of John Millington for thAt sun 7? He must confess that it appeared quite clear to him that if they had taken such a step this Court would have restrained them, inasmuch as it wass quite comPetent foreJohntmillington to give his daughter a laqrger sum in lieu and satisfaction of the one settled upon her marriage. That he meant to do so by the settlement of his property in 1817 was beyond all question, and his wil plainly evidenced that his executors were not to be liable for any former debt due from him to his children, as it was therein stated that what had already been given to his children and what they took under his will were to be in full satisfaction and discharge of all claims and demands upon him (thetestator) in auy right or manner whatsoever. With respect to the 1,000t. covenanted to oe placed by John Millington to the trustees, it was quite true that, as between the trustees and the ceatui que trusts, the trustees could not be heard to say thatthey had never received it, for they never attempted to get it from John Milington. The trustees, however, if they had been called upon to pay it, would have had a right over against John Mlsngton, and therefore the claim of the ceestui gue trusts wvas in fact a claim against John Millington. Without donbt the 1,0001. was paid to James Chambers by John Mlillington, but by his wgill 31illmngton declared that all advances made by him to his daughter Jane or her husband were to be considered as gifts, and therefore this 1,0001. had no reference to the settlement of 1802. It must therefore be taken that the 1,0001. comprised in the last-named settlement was never paid by the settler; but in point of fact he did afterwards settle upon his daughter more than double 2,0001., and by his wil in plain terms declared that such provision was to be in fU satisfaction of all claims that she or her hnsband might have upon him. That stipulation could not be restricte l to direct claims or demands upon the testator, but must be deemed to include circuitous claims, such as his indirect liability under the settlement of 1802 through the trustees. Taking, therefore, a different view of the case to that of the Vice-.hancellor, the decree must be reversed and the bill dismissed; and, as the claim of the plaintiff was a most ungracious one, considering that Mr. and Mr Chambers and tbeir family had had the fuU benefit of the settlement of 1817, it must be dismissed with costs.
PEM.NY V. ALLE.
This appeal was argued a few days back and reported in The Times. The question, one of no general interest, was whether a recovery suffered many years ago was valid.
The LORD C1ANCELLOR this moning delivered an elaborate judgment, and held that the recovery was invalid, on the ground that the parties beneficially interested in the property had not all concurred in it. His Lordship also diected an inquiry as to the persons now entitled to the property.
BROAMDENT V. THE DIPERIAL GAS COlIPANY.
The LORD CHANCELLOR directed this appeal, which was argued some time back and stood for judgment, to be placed in the paper on Thursday next, to be reargued by one counsel on each side before his Lordship and two common law judges.
(Before the LOBDs JusTICEs or APPEAL.) THOMIPSON V. PICH.-IN RE HAYWARD.
Lord Justice TURNER said that at the hearing of the cause their Lordships had felt it their duty to call upon Mr. John Hayward, a solicitor of the court, to show cause why, upon the materials before it in this suit, and in other suits, he should not be struck off the roll. His Lordship entered into a full statement of the facts, which have already appeared in The inmes, and continued by observing that most undoubtedly if the facts had stood unexplained the Cout would have felt it a duty and an act of justice to the public to show the integrity and character of solicitors are most important, and no less a duty to the great body of solicitors themselves, to whose character for integrity it was impossible to bear too high testimony, to have ordered this gentleman to be at once removed from the roU of its officers. That there had been a gross and unqualified breach of trust in regard to the 1,0001. and 5001. was plain, and great irregularity and serious misconduct as to the 3,5001. could not he doubted. When solicitors become trustees they become not only responsible like other trustees, but as officers of the court they are expected to act with the same care as other trustees, and are amenable to the Court for their conduct in that character. Upon looking at the affidavits which Mr. Hayward had filed a doubt had been created in his Lordship's mind, though they undoubtedly did not r.- move altogether the impression made on it by the former proceedings, and more especially as to the point of the title deeds,of which Mr. Hayward swore that he did not recollect the matter, and left it aU to his clerk ; nor did he remember the borrowing the deeds from Mr. Finch, which Mr. Finch had positively sworn that he did; and, moreover. Mr. Finch has said that he did not think Mr. Hayward had a fraudulent intention. It altogether appeared that forgetfulness or inadvertence, rather than dishonesty, were attri butable to Mr. Hayward. Beyond this the affidavits bore strong testimony to the character of Mr. Hayward, and also to his honesty, integrity, and kindness of disposition ; they showed that he was respected by clients who had again resorted to his advice and professional assistance even after he had been compelled to pass through the Insolvent Court. Those affidavits proved that county magistrates and other influential persons had restored him to the many important offices he had held, and that he had been re-elected a member of the Law Society to which he before belonged, and beyond this the circumstance of rest - tution which Mr. Osborne had mentioned some time siare to the Court, and considering that Mr. Hayward's entanglement with the affairs and property of Sir J. K. Shaw appeared to have led to the difficulties in which he had been involved, it appeared to himn (Lord Justice Turner) that justice wvould be satiefied by directing that no further proceedings he taken in the matter and that MWr. Haywvard should pay the costs of the proceedings.
Lord Justice KRNscsr BRUCE said he was of the same opinion.
Sir F. Thesiger and Mr. Tripp showed cause on behalf of Mr. Hayward; Mr Taylor appeared for the solidtor to the Suitors' Pund.' rapae o h olio
CORLEY V. LORD STAFFORD.
CAMSPBELL V. CORLEY.
3Ir. DANUEL and Mr. SOUTHGATE appeared for the plain. tiff in the first suit, which is instituted by Mr. John Corley, of 4, Verulam-buildings, Gray's-inn, against Lord Stafford, the surviving trustee of the will of Mr. Francis Gostling, late of the city of Norwich, deceased, praying a declaration that Mr. Corley is entitled to the dividends of 10,0001.
Three per Cent. Consols, and 2,8001. Three-and-a-Quarter per Cents., for life, as the surviving hiusband of his deceased wife Constantia, the daughter of Air. Gostling
Their LoRDSBjIPS thought that the cross-suit shoutld be proceeded with.
Mr. WIGRASr, in ankwer to Juest'ons from the Court, said that after the decision whicqc hid taken p lace on the validity of the marriage he could no longer resis the claim of Mr. Corley t." the life interest.
Lord Justice KNIrGT BRUCz said, that the first suit was practically at an end, excepting as to the question of costs.
CAMPBELL V. CORLEY.
Mr. WIGRAM appeared for the Plaintiff in this suit, and sad that he should establish, from certain agreements execut-ed by Mx. Corley and Mrs. Campbell before the mar. riage, and from letters which had passed between them, and from other letters, that Mr. Corley agreed that his wife should have the whole savings of her property at her disposal other than that which she took under her father's wiU, with power to appoint the same, and on default of apuointmnent that the same should belong to her next of kiD. The learned conusel proceeded to read the following two papers; one dated the 20th of June, 1850, was this.- "Memorial of an agreement entered into this 20th day of June, 1850. Whereas I, John Corley, hereby agree to become a consenting party to such deed or documenti to be duly signed, sealed, and attested by credible witnesses, as may be mutually agreed on, by which M Constantia Cam pbell wll be fully authorized and empowered, notwithstanding her coverture, to make such disposition as may be agreed and directed therein of such dividends or funds, amounting to the SUns of 2,0001., out of whatever funds or dividends she shall be entitled to be possessed of or have legally acquired at the time of her decease. And it is further agreed by me that in case the said Constantia Campbell should survive me all such funds or dividends, or ay contingencies therein as ahe may be entitled to at my decease, shall devolve to her, and become her sole and separate property, to dispose of as *be, the said Mn'
Cam pbell, may think fit; and io this agreement I have hereby affixed my seal and signature the day and year above writt en.-JOIIN COR LE. Witness, Jamxes Stentiford." The other document wvas as follows :-"Memorandum of an rgreesent-Having, this 20th dy of June, 1850, agreed with John Corley that he shall on the first opportunity to
si6mirnteg&aIrnstee under-the-will otmyfatherr -zncis' Goatling, Esq., I, Constantine Campbell, hereby consent, ironuse, and -agree to become a consentinig party to such deed or documentoa5 may be mutually agreed on,.authorizing the sid John Corley's appointment to the said trust; and I hereby consent and promise not to give my sanction or consent to the nomination of any other party to said trust without having first had the consent of the said John Corley to such appointment. And I further promise and agree to refuse becoming a party to any proceedings at law that might tend to invalidate the right of the said John Corley to the trust funds or the benefit thereof in the will of the said Francis 4ostling, decessed, should the said John Corley become entitled thereto by survivorship. And to the said agreement I have hereby affixed my seal and signature the day and year above written.-C. CQUIuLj.."
lord Justice KNiGHT BRucz wished to Lnow whether Mr. Wigram hoped to establish a right to more than the 2,0001. mentione4 in the first document.
M[r. WIGRBm replied that unless he thought from the letters he should read he should be ablo so to do, he would not occupy the attention of the Court, but he might at once remark that Mr. Campbell was open to any reasonable offier of a compromise.
3Sr. SOUTXGATE, for Mr. Corley, was willing to allow 1,000L, and that mutual releases shotld be executed, and so an end put to all litigation.
lord Justice KNiGIT BRUCZ thought that if Mr. Corley would make the sunr 2,0001., and abide by the other terms, it would be liberaL That gentleman could not be surprised at the irritation Mr. Campbell had exhibited. Few men liked their mother to contract a second marriage, and such an event would be particularly distasteful to a man whose mother had reached the mature age of 80.
A conversational squabble ensmed, in which Mr. Corley said he had been put to enormous costs, while he had himself abstained from incurring or putting other parties to expense, and in which Mr. Campbell declared that John Corley bad never been married to 3IMrs. Campbelt, and divers counsel made conflicting statements, the whole of which ended in the compromise failing and the cause proceeding.
Mr. WIGRAm then read extracts of many letters, which the learned counsel insisted supported the notion that Mr. Corley had agreed tosettle the savings of his wife in such manner as would confer upon her next of lin the benefit of them. In a letter dated August 2, 1849, addressed by Mrs. Campbell to Mr. Corley, that lady said,-" But before entering into detail there Is one point to be got over, and I shall feel truly grieved if you do not see the matter in the same light as myself, or that you consider it a hardship even to yield. I mean that what little property I have before marriage may be truly and bond .fde mine after marriage, to be my own to give, to use, and to wilL You will, as my husband, have every due regard on any person to whom I might wish to leave an allowance or otherwise; if this wish is not complied with I should return from the altar pauperied, with not a shilling I could call my own. I coald not consent to this, nor ought you to wish it, remembering that on the day of marriage I take from my son his whole and entire interest for your life of the property left me by my father. . . I trust to your good feelng and justice." In another letter she said, - I beg to recall to your recollection the purport of myletter and wishes, that what little propertyI now have is to be mine as if not married, and I mrst trust to your drawing up, or some one for you, the proper legal document that will legalize this act. . . The money from my father's will is so firmly and clearly settled on you aftermy death that on this you can have, I may say, nothing to wish for, as far as the income goes, andI can alter nothin
as named in the will of my father; the one point with reference to my savings has only to be comfortably settled and all is clear before us. I ask you for nothing; I leave this point entirely to yourself . . . I rely unon your honour that this is properly done, and with as muc privacy as possible, before the marriage." The learned counsel read at great length an enormous list of letters, from which he contended that the same intentions on the part of Mrs. Campbell appeared, and some letters from Mr. Corley, from vwhich le (Mr. Wigram) inferred a full agreement to her proposal.
The case is to be continued on Monday (this day) after the vivd voce examination in " Smith v. Lakeman."

VICFCHANCELT,ORS' COTTR .TA- 77
UHA¶ IAPNlPRVq - RTTTTAl.T
(Before ViceChanecdllor Sir B. T. RDuEIsLEy.)
This bill was filed by the Rev. Mr. Champneys, rector of St. Mary's, Whitechapel, to establish his right as rector to cettain annual customary payments in lieu of tithes upon certain houses within the parish, such species of tithes being excepted from the Tithe Commutation Act, and standing on the same footing as tithes of mines, deer, rabbits, fish, &c., which could only be by custom. The bil was filed in 1853, had been amended by order, and was an ordinary tithe-bill-a proceeding now somewhat uncommon. The plaintiff's case was that the parish of St. Mary, Wlitechapei, like that of St. Leonard's, Foster-lane, and others, although suburban, was extra-parochial, and not within the lberties of the city of London, but in "Dr. Grant's case," (1 Guil., 259), " Pocock v. Titmarsh," (2 ibid, 629), and other cases, customary payments had been held good in such a case. The tithe-books were the rector's title-deeds, and previously to the year 1750, when the London Hospital was erected, there was no entry of payments in respect of it, except for tvo or three years' payments for rates, but from that time the entries were numerous and tolerably regular. The earliest book belonged to the archives of the Bishop of London, and it there appeared that the first rector of Vhiteehapel was in1329. In the reign of Henry VIIL 311.17s. 3d. was the sum named as profits of the rectory, and that same sum appeared at subsequent times by other documents. The ecclesiastical aurvey of 164950, aEter the death of Charles I, mentioned the aources from which the revenues were derived to be levies upon house-rates, besides the parsonage house. 601. of these revenues was colleeted by house-rates, the origin of which was too remote to be traced. As new houses were erected it was alleged that such houses were rated by analogy to the old. After the Parliamentary survey, a suit was instituted in the Exchequer, and a sehedule was attached to the bill in which the demands made by the rector were set down, in which the payments varied, but that sohedule showed that the payments were not fixed in respect of rent, but in respect of each house. (" Whalley v. Cooke," 1656.) A decree was made in that suit that the defendants should lay such rates, and the answer, in fact, agreed with the schedule. In 1695 an act was passed to sever St. John's, Wapping, from Whitechapel (5th and 6th of William and Mary), but the origin of the parish as a rectory was involved in great obscurity ; it was said to have taken its name from the fact of a white tower having been built, being then, probably, a chapel of ease to Stepney, of which it was a part. The books had not been well preserved, but this appeared-viz., that accounts were kept in 1730 and 1731; again, from 1748 to 1756, andfrom 1758 to 1774. There 'was then a blank until 1786, and there were regular books until 1802, and from 1804 until 1823. There was here a biatus until 1826, and from that year books were existing to the present time, although not applicable to the whole of the parish. The defendants, Buchan, Cunningham, Martyn, and James, occupied houses in the parish in Mount-street, Mount-place, and elsewhere, and the first two had for some time paid various sums of a few shilings yearly, varying from 12s. to 14s., and so on, and these had been entered ia the tithe-books inter alia, and the only mode of identifying the houses was by the names of the occupiers as there entered, and the explanation of the variations of sums was that there was a change of houses, and, in fact, that the sums had always been invariable, and therefore constituted a custom. The defendants' ease was, that the payments in question, although entered in the tithe-books, were, in fact, Easter dues and voluntary payments, and where those payments were munificent, or of large amount, they were actually entered aS such. There was nothing to show that if a change of house had taken place the party who was substituted had paid the former sum* it was therefore impossible to support the case either as a nod ts deciniandi or a custom, and the plaintiff must therefore fail in his contention.
Mr. Fleming aud Mr. Lindley appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Baily, Mir. Holroyd, and Mr. Buxton for the defendants.
Mr. FLE3G was heard in reply.
The VICE-CHtANCELLOR said that he must be furnished with all books and documents in the case, which he must consider before he could pronounce his judgment.
(Bclore Vice-Chan2llor Sir J. STUART.)

This was a bill by the plaintiff, as the legal personal repreEentative of her late husband, for the purpose of obtaining paynment of a sum of 4001. alleged by the plaintiff to be due under a bond given by the reputed father of her late husband for securing to the latter the payment of the sum of S00I. The plaintiff sued infor-mf paupei-e. The case occupied a portion of Friday and of this day, but the facts were w.ithout interest.
ra. Malins and Mr. Cary were counsel for the plaintiff, and Mr. Bacon and MIr. Amphlett for the defendants.
The VICE-CILtNoELLOR dismissed the bill without costs, as the bill contained allegations of fraud vhich were unfounded. He regretted that it could not be dismissed with costs, inasmuch as the plaintiff sued informd paupcr*.

WAY CObIPANY.
The VICECHAICELLOR, having disposed of the list of petitions and short causes, proceeded with the hearing of this claim. At the conclusion of the arguments his Honour reserved his judgment, and it is, therefore, at present unnecessary to enter further into the facts of the case than by mentioning that it is a claim fled by the administrator of a deceased vendor to the company for specific performance of an agreement made in 1847 for the sale to them of a piece of land, of which thev have ever since been in possession, and for payment of the purchase money to the plaintiff or into court, under the 76th section of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act ; aud the whole argument turned upon the construction of this and other clauses of the act, with reference to their application to the case.
Mr. Daniel, Mr. Willcock, Mr. Speed, Mr. De Gex, and Mfr. Schomberg appeared forthe several parties.
Court Of Queen's Bench, Westminster, Jan. 17.
COURT OF QUXBES BENCIL WzmnSNsTER JAX. 17-
WIGHTMA and CRomrpToN.
(Sitings tn Banoo, before Lord CAMPBLELL and Justicce
ME QUES V. MARI CLARKE (52 RE ALICA RACE).
In this case a writ of habeas corpus had issued directed to Maria Clarke, the matron of the Sailors' Orphan Girls School, at lHampstead, to bring up the body of Alicia Race. a girl of the age of 10 years and a half, with a view to her being delivered up to her mother. The case wAs mentioned on the first day of term, when the argn. ment was specially fixed to take place this day; and. asit was understood the mother was a Roman Catholic, and objected to her daughter's receivng a Protestant education, and that the daughter was unwilling to leave the institution, the case excited a great deal of interest. As soon as the eae was called on,
The officer of the Court read the return made to the writ by the matron of the institution, which was in effect that the girl had been placed in the Asylum by the Royal Commissioners of the Patriotio Fund; that she (the
imatron) aA not etamined, and does not roudwCaG-, dher against her will, but that Asea continued with her, and
tiUl continued, at her-own deire; and that she (the matron) had the body of the girl, ready to abide the brder of the Court.
Lord CAIPBELIL inquired whether the girl was in court. Mr. Serjeant Sim said she was, and, as she was only 10& years old, he moved that sho be delivered up to her mother.
Lord CAM1PBELL asked Mr. O'Malley to state in a single sentence what he should contend the Court ought to do.
Mr. O'MArnxY, Q.C. (with whom was Mr. Lush), said he wished the child to be at perfect liberty to chooso for her-- self.
Mr. BOVILL, Q.C., who appeared for the Patriotic Fund Corimissioners, suggested that the Court would not force the child to go anywhere against her will.
Mr. Serjeant SHm then said he would read to the Court the affidavits whichshowed the circumstances of the case,who the father of the child was, the present opinions of the child, the conduct of those in whose custody she was, and thea he Ehould leave the question for the determination of the Court. The learned Serjeant then read the affidavit of Alicia Race, which stated she was the widow of Lauman Race, late a Sergeant of MArines on board Her Majesty's ship Pique, who was killed in action in September, 1854 and that she had by him two children-John, aged about 12 years, and Alicia, aged about 10 year. In Jul7, 1855, she received a letter from the Rev. Mr. LeAch, the clergy man of Little Stoneham, in Suffolk, where she was then residing, stating that if she would send her daughter Alicia to the SaUore' Orphan Girls School and Home at Hampstead, the girl would be kept, clothed, and educated at the expense of the Royal Patriotic Fund, until she was fit for a situa. tion, and then fitted out; and that in consequence she sent her child to that institution, where she had continued ever since. She said the school and home in question was under the management of the said Maria Clark as matron, who had the actual custody of the child, but the institution was under the control of the executive committee of the Royal Commissioners of the Patriotio Fund, of which Captain Fishbourne was the secretary acting in roference to the institution. Having occasion to feel dissatisfied with the religious education which her child was receiving at the institution, and being desirous of removing her, the mother applied with that view to the mxtron on several occasions, and particularly on the 13th of November, and on the 1st, 11th, and 20th of December, 1856, and requested to have the child delivered up to her, but the matron, in reply, stated that she could not have the child without an order from the executive committee. She stated that up to a recent period her eldest Child, John Race, was in the Sailors' Orphan Boys School and Home, at Chardstock, in Dorsetshire, also supported from the Patriotic Fund, and under the control of the executive committee; and that, being desirous of removing him from that institution, she applied on several occasions, personaUy and by letter, to Captain Fishbourne on the subject; and that, after much trouble, she obtained from him a letter addressed to the Rev. C. Woodcock, and dated October 25, 1856, in these words:-" Mrs. Race wishes to take her child away, which, of course, she has a right to do Will you be good enough to allow her to do sot'" Thereupon, she received her son from Chardstock; but she had not been able to obtain any order for the delivering of her daughter, Alicia Race, vho was stil detained at the Sailors' Orphan Girls School at Eiampstead, against her (the mother's) consent. The affidavit went on to state that about December, 1854, the deponent received by post the paper marked B, and in Mlay, 1855, the paper marked C. The learned serieant here read the two documents. The paper marked B was a letter written by the deceased Sergeant Race to his wife, when he was on the point of going into the action where he was kiled. The reading. of this letter excited the most thrilling interest in court, and drew tears from the eyes of not a few. It was as follows:-
H Her Majesty's ship Pique, at Sea, Aug. 25, 1154.
"My dear Wife aud Children,-I now sit down to write a few linos to you previous to going into action. When you receive this I shall be no mor, aIt wI not be sent to you if I survive. I hope you are all quite wel, as I am at tho present time. Mty deas, I write to bid you an eternal farewell, if such is God's will that I am to he cut off: but I trest in Providence, aud hope I may bo spared to meet you again; but as we cannot all expect to survive to teU the tale, and I may be one that is doomed to die in defeace of my Queen am. country, thereforo, my dear wife, it wil be a consolation that I died iu defence of liberty, and done my best, as in duty bound by myoath, when I took to the profession of arms. Mydcar Alicia, Ihave reade my wi to you, and I trust you will carry it out according to my wish. I wish, my dear, that you will remain a widow until the chidren are capable of taking care of themselves. I hope, my dear, that you will not disregard tais my last wish, as I should not die happy if I thought a stepfather would bo over my babes; but I feel confident that you wil not forget my last wish. hly dear wife, I have not received a letter from you, or any one else, since I left ungland. I should feel very happy to hear from you before I am caUed into eternity: but the Lord's wiU be done: we must bow to His command. My dear Ally, I am but ill prepared to meet my Maker face to face, but I trust He wiU have mercy on my poor soul, and forgive me my transgressions, as I forgive all men that have done me any wrong, before I die. I havo settled all my worldly affairs as far as I can. My dear wife, kis my dear children for me, as a last embrace from a loving father and teU them that his last thoughts were for them, and bring them up in the fear of the Lord. My dear wife, I think I seo poor Alicia by turns weeping for the loss of her poor old man, and theu I see her rejoicing at his return-but, alas I such dreams I My dear, I have written a farewell letter to my mother, brothers, and sisters, and all friends and relations, and I truat you wil not be forgotten by them. MNy dearest vife, give my dying love to your mother and sister, and aU youi friends that may befriend you or my dear children. May we all meet In Heaven is the last prayer of one that you know bow to prize, although he will be in eternity when you receive this last letter he ever wrote, as we are only waiting for the moming to dawn to go into Petroupoloka (lPetropaulovskll, and commence the work of do. struction. It is a Ruassian colony, and we are bound to take it or dle in the attempt. Zly dear wif eand chUdren. It is late, andI require some rest beforo I commence the work of carnage .hat to-morrow may bring forth. My dear, I have not set my foot on shore but twice since I left England, and then only for a few hours on duty.
"The last from your affectionate and loving husband.
LAUMAN it&OE,"
Lord CAmPBELL observed that the letter was the letter of a Christian and a soldier.
Mr. Serjeant SHaEE said it showed that he was brave atriotic, loyal, and religious. A more touching letter never was written, nor one that evidenced more clearly that the writer was a conscientious and honourable man. The learned serjeant then continued the affidavit of the applicant, which stated that she had always been a Roman Catholic.
Lord CAMPBELL said he did not know that it would make any difference, but he should like to know whether it appeared by the affidavit that the father was a Roman Catholie.
Mr. Serjeant SHE said he was not; he was a Protestant. The affidavit stated that the applicant was and always had been, a Roman Catholic, and that during the lifetime of the father (who was a Protestant), and with his consent, she gave her children such religious instrmction as was in accord. ance with her own religious profession, and taught them to say Roman Catholc prayers, and that her husband had often enjoined them to say the prayers she should teach them. The learned serjeaut then read the affidavit of the applicant's solicitor, Mr. F. R. Ward, of No. 4, Lincoln's-innfields, which stated that he had inspected the will of the late Sergeant Race at the Admiralty, dated the 24th of A\ugust, 1854, and that thereby the testator, after bequeathing all his property to his wiife, directed that his Bible and papers should be sent to his wife, and concluded thus:
"Idoherebynomninate, constitute, and appoint my wifo, Alicia Race,executerof thismyvwiandtestament, feeling confident that she will do jubtice to my dear children, as a wife and mother."
The remainder of it (Mr. Ward's affidavit) related to the steps taken by him to obtain the delivering up of the child from the executive committee, who informed him that, as the children were supported from the Patriotic Fund, the Royal Commissioners occupied the position of their late father, and that the question would be referred to their decision at their next meeting.
Lord CA3iPBELL.-He said the commissioners were in loco
paracs?s.
hIr. Vard concluded thus-
"Imay add that Mrs Racestates Inone of her letters to me that her daughter refused to go home with her from the institution where she now resides.'
Mtr. Serjeant SHEE said these were the two affidavits on which the writ was granted. He would now read those which had been made in answer. Captain Conolly, of the Royal Marines, stationed at Chathar, stated that he had known the deceased for several years at Chatham, previous to his embarcation, and that he invariably attended the serviceof theChurch of England and he believed no otherplace of religious worship; that, on receiving intelligence of Sergeant Race's death, he offered his services to
the Widow, wvho wassingreat distress and without the means of subsistence, and that she and her children were provided for by the Patriotic Fund ; that she in her letters to him expressed herself thankful for the kindness shown to herself and children, and in one of them3 said " that her great desire was that her children should be brouight up as Protestants, according to the wishes of her late husband ,"
and that during the time Sergeant Race was stationed at Chatbam his children attended the reoimental schools, which were conducted on Protestant principles. There was an affidavit that the child was baptized by a Protestant clergyman. The learned serjeant said that Lord Colchester seemed to take some interest in this matter, and had made an affidavit.
Mr. BoviLL said Lord Colchester was Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Commissioners of the Patriotic Fond,
Mr. Serjeant SHI E said he was going to read his affidavit. Lord Colchester, who was a Rear-Admiral in the Royal Navy, stated that on the 24th of Deoember last he saw the said Alicia Race in a e eparate room, and thereupon, separately and apart from any other person, closely questionod the said Alcia Race, and the result was that he became convinced that no constraint was placed upon the said Alicia Race's leaving the said school; that the girl stated that during the lifetimo of her father she regularly attended the servico of the Established Church and the Sunday school in the chapel of the Royal dockyard at Chatham, and that if afree choice were iiren to her to remain at Hampstead School or go to her mother for the purpose of being placed in a Roman Catholic schooL she wo ld decid. to remaim The affidavit of Captain Fishbourne, honorary secretary of the Commissioners of the Patriotio Fund, stated the circumstances under which the child was taken into the sohool; that 6g. a-week were allowed to the mother; that the mother said her late husband was a Protestant; and that the son and daushter were, with the motheres full coneurrence and approbation, placed
in fhe schooIs at Chir stck-and ampgtead, both ot whic\ selbools sbe kmew were ProtestnC asrg los .h; insg. He stated that in about Oetober ast t aothb ip. plied to have both her children reraoved, in crder, i hg understood, to place them in Roman.catholia.schools,, stating to the elrect that "1her clergynixtwoujdpot ro0,d I school for one cbild witbout the oter,which4wj very sorry for, as she had no fxult to find with the school of home at which her daughter was placed; but she thought it quite as well to bring them up in the sime faitbh &3 herselLf" He stated that in consequence of the re# quest the son had left Chardstock, and was now with his mother; that he had the fullest confidence inthemanagement of and education given at the school but neither he nor the executive committee had objectod ta the daughter's leaving the school if she had not declined so to do; but it had been represented to the chairmsn of the executive committee that the girl of her own unbiassed frae will and choice refused to leave the said school and home, which rerssal he believed emanated from herself. He went on to state that the executive committee had no control over the said school, but that they paid the sun of 15I per annum towards tho clothing, board, and education of the girl, which payment he had no doubt would continue till she was 15 years of age; and that by the rules of the school, if at any time the girLs, after bemg placed in situations, should be out of situations, they are received back at the institution as a temporary home. He also stated that the mother had no ostensible means of support, and was a person of delicate constitution. The affidavit of W. H. lugford, clerk of the commissioners, stated he had on one occssion hoard the mother msay that " her late husband was a Protestant, a member of the Church of
England, and that she was one of those who thought that there wrere as good Protestants as Catholics." Svceral ldettters werethen read, written by the mothoer. In y

" AIaCIA R&1tA,1
The next letter read by the learned serjeant wan from Amy Race, the mother of the late Sergeant Race, dated the. 2th of November, 1856, in which she said:h-
"1I ama sume that may son wouild have been maost unwilling to have had hi, chiUdren brought up in the Idolatrous worsip of the Romane Catholics."
A letter from his brother, Ebenezer Pcac, dated the 25th of November, 18, said :-

Theaoffidavit of the Rmev. E. r. Bickerstth, incimbent of Christ Church, Hampstead, and honorary chaplain of the school, stated that the girl had regularly attendedo Divine service at Christ Clurch, and also a Bible clans ; that she was a child of quick perception, and appeared to have an educated mind above children of her age, so much so that for six months she had teen a monitor, and had been placed in the first class among girls 12 and 13 years of ]tagse stated that on tie 13twh of November, 185h, he read oper a paper to the girl, in the presence of the ladies' committee and the mother, which contained these wordstnl
"As you are old enough to judge betwixt right and wren and have said you believe you are token away to go toDanother echboolur duty Is simply to state that we have no desireto Part with YOU,dand would willinglypermito to remain ith usBut we areoundto saythat your mother does not are to this, but - ishes you to go home to her.

It wan stated by the ladies who were, present that 'when the paper wvas read over to her the girl, in answer to the question whether she would go with her mother, d istintly answered "No;" and, in answer to the question whethier Lhe would remain, sb e distinctly anshered "Yes." The ron. Misse E. T. Lister (one of the ladies committee) and Miss. J. Prance (the hon. secretary of the school) stated Ithat they had no, directly or indirectly influenced or persuaded the girl to remain in the school. Miss Prance also produced a minute of the commtittee of the school on the subject, in which, after setting forth the proceedings on the mothoers visi,it stated,-
'In aordancemwith thoecugctmteon of the Paper, the mother and chid retired aloes to a separate room for a quarter of an hour. They returned to the committee-room, aLnd, on the question being again puti

' other, I cant go-I will not go.' The committee not feeling themselvee bound under the~sj circumstances 1o rmuire Alicia to leave the house, she still remaius," The affidavit of Miss E. Mayo, one of the ladies' committee and that of Miss Maria Clarke, the matron, confirmed somae of the above statements, and stated that they had not influenced the i liild as to her decision.
Lord CASIPIIsELL.-It is merely conftrmatory.
Mr. Serjeant SHEI said the affidavit of the matrou containel one material paragraph. It was-

The affidavit of Wilniam Cousins, Quartermaster of the Royal Militer Asylum, Chelsea, stated that the education given in that asylum an regards religious teaclrhingp andote rmind by the religion of the father, and that where tho cbild was without parents the baptismal certificate was taken as proofof thereligionin hichtoeducate, The affb - davit of. AyPRace, thermotherof Sergeant R*ce,confirmed sameaof tiemabove facts, and thatof James Pinhorne stated that by the rules of the Royal Hospital School at Greenwich, cbildren wero educated in the religiou of the father, or according to the barstistnal certificate in the absence of anny express directions of the father, The lwmen ed seijeant then read the affidavit of the mother, made in answer to those which had been made on the other side, in which she stated that on the death of her husband she was plunged into great distress of mind, and while in that state, there being no Reman Catholic chapel where she was, she attended a Protestant placbeof worship, and sufferednher children to go to a Protestant school, hut she didl not cease to be a Roman Catholic, nor did she ever intend her children to be brought up in a differn religion from her own; that herdetermination t oremdotve her chid was the result of her own unbiassed j.udgment, and was greatly increased by the false representations made to her daughter, anti false views in which she was bring educated on the subject of religion.
Inproof whereof she referred to the letter written by the
rlto the matron, from which s-he raid it appeared t t her daughter had "1beens persuaded, contrary to, the fact, that the Roman Catbohio religion teaches that the blesedVirin ar an imgesaretobe worshipped in prefrene t ou Saiou Jeus hrit."She also corn lamd tat er augte ha ben ufailyled,Iby the ~te.

The affidavits on both sides having been read
LordrCARoiuaEL Csaidt-l e are now ready to hear badtht sides an to what the law is.
r Serjeant SHgrd then sadthe result of the affidavitv was thae the father of the child was unt a ldoman Catholic, but a member of the Church of Englhad; that his wife was a Roman Catholic, who had taught her children Relman Catholic prayers, and that the husband had conferred upon her, as appeared by his letter, the rights of testamentary guardian, without an litao. taen motherexe ercised her tutelary rihtsbyplacing child t school, but ,nving ascertained that the child had imbibed anti-Caltholc w mpressions, the mother had chanwed hermirsde and having conscientious scruples, she nowr wished ~r to b restored to her custody, in order that she might be Xought up in her own religion. The child was only 10 S5 and a-half old, and in regular course would not leave the school till she was 15. HIe (the learned scrjeant) would at once state tbat he should contend, first, that, subject to exceptions to which he would -refer afterwards, if a child was undet years of discretionivir, 14 years, the guardian had an ubsolute right to direct its education, and that on the death of the father the guardian succeeded to all the rights of the father, unless the father appointed atestanentary guardian;
ahnd thadt, actig on those principlee, the Conrt in this case
ad no dscretion to exercise, but were bound to give up the child to the ueutody of the mothetr
Iord O~tasPmcLL..-~.YOU admit the qualificaLtion if the father or mother have boon guilty of gross musoonduet ?
hEr, Serjeant Snei said he did, but that question did not
arise here. Secondly, he shouild contend that if the Court had a discretion to exercise it would not exercise it against the will of the mother. Thirdly, that H the Court was aathorized to exercise any discretion, and to consult the wishes of the child, the Court imust be satisfied that the discretion of the child was sufficient in referenc- to the questionl which it had to determine.
Lord CAMPBELL.-Thlero mlust be an examination by the Court to Xascertain the state of the child's n,ind.
Mr. Serjeant SIIEE-TO see whether the child's discretion was sufficient .d hoc. That must bc ascertained somehowv.
Lord CA31PBELL. -YOU cannot deny that the Court bas that powcr'!
Mr. O'MALLEY said he was most anxious that this should be done.
Lord CAMPBELL suggested to the learned serjeant to arguethe first point,-whether the Court had any discretion.
Mr. Serjeant Sssex said, he should not labour his first proposition, that the right of an uncontaminated father to the custody of his child, under 14 years of age, was absolute, and that, after the death of the fatsher, the other succeeded to all his rights.
Lord CAB1rugLL.-And becomes guardian for nurture. It will not be disputed that that extends to 14 years.
Mr. Serjeant SHEE.-The mother cannot have her child for an improper purpose; the Court would not recognize her authority in such case. It was immaterial that she was of the Roman Catholic religion, for that was now a lawful re3igion. The learned counsel here referred to the case of "1'a3bot v. Lord Shrewabury" (4 M. and (,., 683) as being analogous to the present, and cited the language of Lord Cottenham in that case.
Lord CAMrnPBELL observed that there were two classes of caues,-one where the child was a ward of Court, and another where, on a writ of habeas corpus, the Court had seo diapose of a child according to the comwnion law.
, Mr. Serjeant SHx.-All the cases in the Court of Chancery were in suits relating to property.
Lord CAhlPBELL.-The cases to which we have to look are the cases where on habeas corpus a child is brought before a common law court. The Chancery cases might be referred to as illustrations.
Mr. Serjeant SEXE said he would only refer to those cases in Chancery which his learned friend (Mr. O'MaUey) might cite against him.
Lord CA2fPBELL said he did not know that it would make any difference; but he wished to know whether in this case the mother was guardian for nurture only, or tes. tamentary guardian.
Mr. Serjeant Si{EE said he should contend that the language of the will constituted her testamentary guardian. The words of the wrill were-" I do hereby nonminate, constitute, and appoint my wife, Alicia Itace, executor of this xay wi and testament,feeling confidentthat she willdo iustice to my two children, as a wife and a mother." The learned serjeant then cited of roo's Abridgment, tit. guardian," Hoale's Pleas of the Crown, p. 27, ansd CwnynD's Lligesf, tit. " guardin D," to show that the age of discretion was 14; and the language of Tindal, C. J., inl *"R. v. Lloyd" (3 M. a to show that after 14 she might cheese for herself.
Lord CAimrnxLs. said there could be no doubt that, what. ever the rights of guardian for nurture were, they extended to the age of 14.
MIr. Serjeant SscsE.-The question now was whether, when a child of 10 years and a-half was brought before the Court, the Court would decide, against the will of the parent, that the child was to be allowed to refuse education which the parent thought it right to give, and to go and act for herself. In some of the cases there were expressions which gave some colour to the doctrine that the Court would do no more than free the child from improper restraint and authori7z her to go where she would, but there was no ease which contradicted the right of the parent up to the ago of 14. The learned serjeant then cited several cases, and the case of " R. v. Delaval" (2 Win. BI., 409) decided by Lord Mansfield, in which his Lordship reviewed all the previous cases. Some of the early c.es were authority to Ehow that the Court would allow a child discretion ; and it would be said on the other side that the more recent cases had extended the jurisdiction of the Courtin such cases. The case of " E. v. Greenhill" (4 A. and E., 624), it would be said, extended that discretion below the age of 14. In that case the children were of the ages of 51A, 4A. and 2i, and the right of the father to the custody of them was upheld. The learned serjeant cited the judgment of Lord Denman,which contained this passage:-"When an infant is brought before the Court by habcas corpus, if he be of an age to exercise a choice, the Court leaves him to elect where he will go. If he be not of that age, and a want of discretion wvonld only expose him to dangers or seductions, the Court must make an order for his being placed in the proper custody."
Mr. Justice CRo-mroN said that within the age of nurture the father or mother might remove their children by force.
Lord CAArPBELL said that in the Court of Chancery the Lord Chancellor considered what was best for the child.
Mr. Serjeant SsxEE then cited the case of " R. v. Preston' (5 D. and L., 247), and "R. v. Hakewell" (12 C. B., 230), " Ward v. Ward" (7 Phillips, 786). The learned serjeant was about to address himself to the other parts of his argument, but
Lord CAMPBELL said he thought it would be better to keep the question of the right of the guardian separate, and see whether she had the absolute right to have the child given up. The Court would afterwards consider the other questions.
Mr. FI LASON followed on the same side, and said he has not found a single authority where the Court had refused to deliver up a child under 14 to its father or testamentary guardian, xcept in the case of a contaminated parent or guardian o and hc cited a case fron the Yfar Book (n Edw. 4, fol. 7, if. T. 2; the Exchequer Chamnber), where it had been hold that the guardian had the absolute power to take the child back.
Mr. Justice CstyrroPTc said, that was the case referred to in Conipn'as Digest (tit. " Guardian D)") for the position that " if a guardian by reason of nurture delivers the infant to another for his instruction he may afterwards retake him."
Mr. FINLASON.-It might be said that no force was used towards the child. But that was not the question. There was force used upon the guardian.
Mr, O'AMALLEY said, he understood that the sole question to be considered now was, whether the Court could exercise its discretion in the matter, or whether it was bound to deliver the child to its mother-in other words, to im. prison it.
Lord CAMsPBELL said, the learned counsel might use the expression by way of argument.
Mnr. O'ALLEY said, the object of the present application was for the imprisonment of the child, not for its liberty. The learned scrjeant had contended that there was no guardian for nurture when there was a testamentary guardian.
Lord CAMaPBELL.-QmQoad hoc, they are the sauie.
MIr. O'MALLEY.-The power of a testamentary guardian extended to 21 years of age, but a guardian for nurture only to 14. According to the learned serjeant's argument, the mother could come into court and ask for the delivery of the child, though she might be 20 years of age. The rule of law was clear; the only difficulty was in its application. This court was not a court for determining the guardianship of a child. It was not the duty of the Court to deliver it to any particular person, but only to put an end to the custody, in order that the child might exercise its choice. The learned counsel here cited the language of
ir. Justice Coleridge ("R. v. Greenhill"), who said, "Therule, then, is to be considered upon purely legal principles. A habeas eor.pus proceeds on the fact of an illegal restraint. When thl writ is obeyed, and the parts brought up is capable of using a discretion, the rule is simple, and disposes of many cases, namely, that the individual who has been under the restraint is declared at liberty, and the Court will even direct that the party shall be attended home by an officer to make the order effectual. But when the person is too youiig to have a choice we must refer to legal principles to see who is entitled to the custody, because the law presumes that where the legal custody is no restraint exists; and when the child is in the hands of a third person, that presumption is in favour of the father," &c. The questionthben was, whether the child had a discretion or poxver of making a choice ?
Mr. Justice CROR-PTON.-You say it is analogoUs to the case where the law presumes that a child has an incapacity to commit crime?
Mr. O'MALLEY said be did; and that when the child was between 7 and 14 years of age the Court would look into the circumstances to see whether the child was capable of snaking a free choice. The learned couiisel then cited the language of Lord Denman in " R. v. Greenhill," referred to in ilr. Serjeant Shee's argument, and also the language of Mr. Justice Coleridge before cited. He relied on the decLsion of Chief Justice Tindall in the case of " R. v. Lloyd" (3 M. and G., 547), in which that learned judge. after saying that it was a case of somei difficulty, and that the child was between 11 and 12 years of age, went on to say that the child was old enough to choose for herself, azid the Court did not feel called upon to compel her to go with her motber; and that, if she wenmt, it mnust be with her own free will, and no force must he used. That was what he (the learned counsel) said here. If the child said sha would go with her mother, let her go.
Lord CAMPBLLL said, that was a str:ng authority in support of the learned counsel's proposition that the Court would look at the capacity of the individual child.
Mr. O'MALLEY.-In the case of " t. v. Smith" (2, Strange) the child was between 13 and 14 years old, and
et Lord Mansfield, in the case cited in Burrozes Bepvorts,
addedl the weight of his anUth_o_ribty _th-atit' was a well-deided case. If the rule contended for on the other side existed, is was a remarkable fast that a rmle so simple had never been *nentioned, a rule which said that, if the child was under 14, she must be delivered up. The learned counsel then eommented upon several of the cases which had been before cited.
Mr. Justice Cnosr'roN asked whether a child might say 'I don't like my school" ?
Mr. O'MALLgY contended that, after a child had come to seven years of age the question always had been whether it could exercise a discretion. The leariied counsel went on to contend, and with sonie warmth of nianner, th4t zeligious truth might lay hold of the conscience of a child as powerfully as of that of an older peroron * and that the assistance of this Court was now invoked on order that they
ruight place the chiid under the care of nuns in some i uonastic institution, where that hook froiii which she had learned the truths of religion wvouil(d be tAkon fronit her, and where she would be compelled to go throijgh offices which were abhorrent to her convictions.
L srd CAPBELL. said that, if there were any who regarded thBrroteatant relgon with horror, all the learned counsel's
*ar,gZmeut would equally apply iii this case. The case might
am-lIe of a chid taught to worship " the Mother of God," wi.ose mother sight ca31llupon the Court to deliver her up.
Mr. O'MALLEY said, be thought it would be a moat grievous thing to force the conscience of the chid when it
had arrived at an age to forns religious convictions. The V.ourt would bear in mind that in the Protestant religion theme was no restraint but that of iofluence and opinion; tut it was widely differemit in the other, and therefore the C4,nrt would imore jealously iniquiire whethler the child was free or not. The learned couniieel comcl,,ied by expressing l,is conviction, that if the Court shoulhd hey down the rtLle
1i,t wh,-re a child was uimder 14 yLai s *f age they Tnust I *liver it up to the custody ,f thje guardm..m: they would be i cnverting the writ of ha'icas corpus-v in:tei,'ed as a writ for
obtaining liberty, into one for deciding the rights of otbers.
Mr. LUSEr foUowed on the same side, and entered into a lengthened examination of the various cases bearing on the question.
Mr. BOVILL, Q.C., said he wished to say a few words on the part of the Commissioners of the Patriotic Fund.
Lord CAw3,PBELL said the commissioners had done nothing but what was approved.
Mr. BOVILL, on the part of the commissioners, pressed upon the Court that the custody of the child ought not to depend upon its age. The commissioners were the trustees of a large fund, and had placed the child in the asylum, and objected to give her up to the mother.
Lord CAIIPBEIL.-lf being a Roman Catholic is a disqualification for having the custody, the mother is disqualified.
Mr. BOVIIL said that to give the child up would be contrary to decisions in the Court of Ch'ancery. The father was a Protestant, and it would be contrary to his express intentions. Moreover, the custody of the mother would be improper, and, that being the case, the Court would not order the child to be given up to her, The affidavits showed that this proceeding was not the act of the mother. She said " it went to her heart" to take the child away. Besides, she had no means of supporting it; but she wanted to get it for an improper purpose. The Court would examine the child's own wili on the subject, and see if she had discretion; and not only that, but there were other grounds to be considered.
Lord CAMPBELL.-Would the Court examine the child in open court, as to her theological knowledge?
Mr. BOvILL.-The Court would take reasonable means of ascertaining her discretion.
Mr. Serjeant SsEE replied, and commented on the various cases cited on the other side, and, in reference to the argument from analogy which had been used, observed that in this case, instead of the maxim, Matitia supplet actatemw, it was now sought to introduce a new one, Tleologia stupplet cetatcm. (Laughter.)
At the close of the argument
Lord CAMPBELL said the Court would take time to consider, and give judgment on Monday in favour of Mr. O'aiA ey or the guardian.
Mr. O'MALLEY said, the question would still remain whether the mother's was the proper custody.
Lord CAMPBELL said no question of that kind had been thrown out in the argument; but the Court would look at the aflidavits.
Mr. BOVILL pressed to be heard on that point.
Lord CAMIPBELL said he saw no impropriety in the voman's conduct, except her placing the chi d at school, and now wishing to take her away.
Mr. O'ALnLlxy said he had not been heard on that point.
Mlr. BOVILL said, he wished to argue that to remove the child would be against the will of the child, against the express will of the father, and against the real wishes of the mother. He should also contend that the custody of the mother was improper, that the object for which she wanted the child was improper, that she was precluded by her own acts from demanding it, and that she had no means of supporting it.
Mr. O'ALULEY hoped the Court would not decide that question on the affidavits without hearing him.
Lord CAMPBELL said the Court would hear the learned counsel now.
Mr. O'MALLEY then addressed the Court at some length on this point. Itwouldbe lending the power of the Courttothose who would exercise it forthe injury of the child. The father always brought his children up us Protestants, and sent them to Protestant schools. He himself always attended the worship of the Church of England. Considering that his wife was a Roman Catholic, those acts showed a strong will. It was found also that for eight months after their father's death the children attended a Protestant school and Protestant worship, and the mother went with them. That was the way she interpreted her husband's wish, that she would " do justice to his children." The mother might have got the commissioners to place her children at Roman Catholic schools, but, with her full approbation, they were
laced at a Protestant school, and the girl continued there Por 16 months without any complaint from the mother. At that time, the mother came under the influence of others, who did not propose any means of educating the child, but merely desired that it should be got away from a Protestant school. She said, "it went to her heart " to take the child away, but she said that the gentleman could not do anything for the boy unless she took away thel girl also. The application was not made lce2 fide by the mother, but the object was to place the child under the care of priests, who would frustrate the father's dying wishes.
Mr. BOVILL was heard on the same point, and contended that the rule followed in the Chelsea and Greenwich schools ought to be followed, and the child educated in the religion of its father.
Mr. Serjeant SnEE, in reply, contended that by his will the father had reposed unlimited confidence in his wife as to the care of his children. Re might have directed that they should be brought up in the Protestant religion, but he did not. On the contrary, he allowed his wife to teach the children Roman Catholic prayers, and no doubt that prayer to the Blessed Virgin which every Catholic offered up night and morning. The wife now, in the discharge of her conscientious duty, wished to educate her children in her own religion, and she had a right to do so-the more so as she found the child was taught anti-Catholic doctrines, such as could not be found in the Church Catechism.
At the close of the case
Lord CAINPBELL said the Court would look into the affidavits, and would give judgment on Wednesday.
The arguments occupied the whole day till about 5 O'clock.

Mr. Francis conducted the case for the plaintiff, and Mr. Petersdorff that of the defendant.
This was an actionx to recover the amount of a promissory note for 590 franca. The note was mnade at Ostend on the 1st of Febrary, 183, by the defendant, in favour of one Kress, hy whom it was endorsed to the plaintiff. The plaintiff was an appraiser and broker, at Southampton-row. The defendant was a horsedealer at Shepherd's Bush.
The plea was that the defendant was a minor at the time of the execution of the note.
There was a good deal of imputation thrown upon the defendant by the plaintiff, which, however, was refuted by the defendant, and ultimately

'Ibis was an action tried before Mr. Justice Wiles, when a verdict was found for the defendant.
Mr. Serjeaut BYLES now moved for a new trial. The defendant, it appeared, was the manager of a provident institution and savings-bank, ia St. Martin's lane, of which his Royal Highness Prince Albert was pre. sident, and the plaintiff was one of the clerks. It became necessary, last spring, in consequence of a requirement of the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt of certain returns, that the clerks should work long hours. This created complaints among them, and they signed a round-robin to a memorial to Prince Albert, complaining that they were worked from 9 in the morning till 12 at night, and gave this to Mr. Boodle the secretary, to present. That gentleman never forwarded the memornal, and in consequence of their representation being totally neglected the clerks became insubordinate and careless, and this led to a sub-committee of management passing a resolution on the 18th of March to dismiss them all in a body. This was read to them, and many of them went away-among others the plaintiff; but he returned on the 20th. On the 3d of April a general meeting of the managing committee confmired the resolution come to, and the clerks were all dismissed. The plaintiff brought his action for being dis missed without notice, and it was now contended that the plaintiff's return on the 20th of MaTch, when he was permit. ted to remain, was a condonation of his past offences, and that he wvas entitled to notice before dismissal.
The COURT refused the rule.
SMSITH V. WVOODPINE.
This was an action for breach of promise of marriage, tried before Mr. Justice Willes, at the Guildhall, when a verdict was found for the plaintiff for 3,0001. damages.
A rule ni having been obtained to set this verdict aside and for anew trial on certain affidavits, and because the damages were excessive,
Mr. Serjeant Byles, Mr. M. Smith, Q.C., and Mr. Unthank, appeared to show cause against the rule, and Sir Frederick Thesiiger, Mr. M. Chambers, Q.C., and Mr. Prentics in support of it.
Mr. Serjeant BYTEs now contended that the affidavits showed no ground of surprise, and the complaint wvas simply that the damages were excessive on the facts proved at the triaL It appeared that Mr. Smith, the plaintiff's father, had been for a considerable time in the Audit-office, and had retired with a pension, having amassed a moderate
nrivate fortune. He had five children, one son and four aaughters. One of the daughters bad married a Mr. Matthews, and Mr. Smith, having lost his wife, resided with his married daughter and other daughters at Hornehurch. The uefendant was a brewer in the vicinity. It appeared at the trial that the defendant had a large and flourising business, and that he had represented that his business was worth 6,0001. a-year; that it bad been valued at 50,0001., but he believed it to be worth 100.0001. ; and that he had 19,0001. or 20,0001. in the funds. He had introduced himself to Mr. Smith, with these representations, as a suitor for his daughter, he being at the time about 32 years of age and the young lady 21. The young lady rectuired some time to interveneto ascertain whether their dispositions would suit, andthedefendantwas eventually regarded as anaccepted suitor, and dined with the plaintiff's father every other Sunday. The match appeared not to be an unsuitable one. Mr. Smith, to say the least of it, was in equal position and not without fortune. He informed the defendant distinctly that his daughter would have nothing until hit death. Mrs. Woodfine, the defendant's mother. gave her consent, and the matter was finally arranged. The defendant looked a.t several houses for their residence, and ended in taking a furnished house, at a rent of 2001. a-year, at Upminster, and talked of having a brougham and servants, such as would be well suitable to his condition if he had been in as good circumstances as he had represented himself to be. The wedding was fixed for the 3d of Apil, and it was arranged that the wedding breakfast should take place at the house of the plaintiff's father. Everything happily progressed till the 17th of March, when, without any intimation whatever, Mr. Smith was surprised by the receipt of this note from the defendant:-
" Dear Sir,-From various causes the affair fixed for the 3d of April must be postponed."
There was no preparation for this note at all. However, pretexts were aleged for it. The first was that the efendant had some relatives named Thompson, one of whom was a dentist near Grosvenor-square, and he complained that no invitation had been sent to him to attend the wedding breakfast. MIr. Smith stated that an invitation had been sent, but the note had miscarried, and the defendant, at Mr. Smith's request, undertook to carry a letter of invitation to hlr. Thompson. There could be no doubt that this was a mere groundless and frivolou, pretext
for breaking offthe match. It was then suggested that an invitation had not been sent to the mother of the defendant, who lived closo by in the same village. To this it was answered by Mr. Smith, "I did not send an invitation to my wife's mother; it would be considered an insult. So near a relative would be expected, of course, to come without an invitation." Mr. Smith then asked, "Do you desire to postpone the maarriage or to break it off?" as he was quite confounded at receiving this letter, and asked the de-
fendant to explain the meaning of it. The defendant said, "You have iusulted my family." "In what manner r inquired Mr. Smith. " In not having sent an invitation to Mr. Thompson," replied the defendant. The defendant said, " Miss Smith accused him of wishing to serve her as he had served Miss Jones ;" and the plaintiff's father said, " Mr. Woodfine, do you wish to break off the match?' The defendant said, " I don't say so; it must be postponed." 'Upon which the mother of the defendant said, "Your daughter cannot love my son; she has allowed him to take a house at Upmineter." The defendant said, "Oh, mother mother; that has nothing to do with it." Mr. Smith said to defendant's mother, "You don't like my daughter." Defendant's mother replied, "I certainly don't like our daughter; she is extravagant and bad tempered." Then this proposal was made to Mr. Smith: the house at Upinnster is too espensive; there is a house in the town at 301. a-year rent will do; and at last Mir. Smith 'was ordered out of the house. There was no mnputation against the young lady. Of course, this conduct required an apology, and the defendant called on
ir. Smith and offered an apology, shook hands, and said he was sorry he had acted so hastily. Upon that he was admitted again to the young lady's society, and another day (the 17th of April) was fixed for tbe wedding. Before. the 17th of April arrived the defendant again harped upon the letter of invitation to Mr. Thompson. The plaintiff was induced to visit the old lady, the defendanT's mother and apologized for any fault on her part. The mother saia it was not her affair; the defendant then came in in his slippers, and, after soine hasty words, left the room, and was heard walking up and down in an upstairs room, and thus the second weddingday was broken off. At an interview shortly after between the plaintiff and the defendant the defendant said he would agree to the marriage taking place if the plaintiff would consent that her father and none of her friends should cross his door after her marriage. She said, " Can I assent to this ? No *" and he said, " No *" and thus it ended. These facts having been proved, the jury found a verictfo th pliniff wih ,001.damag,es. On this evidence, without taffitdaviatVs,theveordict could not be dis-
turbed. The principal affidavit tendered was that of the defendanthimself, 'who by statute couldnot be examined as a witness, when he might be subjected tocross-examination, and 'who now sought to state facts without that test.
Mr. Justice CXEM;WvLL thought there was great difii. culty in receiving the affidavit when the rule was moved for, and that it could not be acted on affirmatively, and it had only been put on the file to exclude an argtument that the defendant durst not pledge himself to facts stated on his behalf.
The learned counsel then contended that the evidence as to the amount of the defendant's property, as proved at the tial, was not substantially contradicted, and that he now sought to do by affidavit what he might have done at the trial, had he thought right so to do, to prove that the defendant had given an exaggerated account of his means. But his statementhad been corroborated by his acts in taking an expensive house, and ordering a carriage and horses, and hiring men servants. One of the affidavits said the brewery business was worth 1,500. a-year, of which the defendant's share was 750l. The learned counsel then referred to several cases reported, showing that even if the damages absorbed all the defendant had, that was no reason for disturbisg the verdict; among others he referred to " Wood v. Hird," 2, Bing. Rep.
Mr. Justice WILLxs.-That was a very particular case. In it there was a fact not mentioned to the Court. The defendant signed his love letters, "Yours without prejudice," kc. (A laugh.)
Sir F. THESIGER.-He wrote them under Mr. Chitty's advice. (Laughter.)
On these grounds the learned counsel contended that the rule ough' to be discharged.
Mr. AL. SMITH and Mr. TiTAN followed on the same side, and submitted that the damages, considering all the circumstances, were reasonable, and that the verdict ought not to be disturbed. There was nothing to show that the jury had come to a wrong conclusion on a matter peculiarly within their province.
Sir F. TnEsIGER, in support of the rule, was aware that a party who endeavoured to disturb a verdict of this description had a very difficult task, and he thought ought to have. He admitted that, unless there 'was misconception on the part of the jury, he could not hope to disturb their verdict. It was true that the defendant had said the brewery had realized 6,0001. the last year, and had been valued at .50.0001., and that the defendant believed it to be of greater value. But there was extravagant exaggeration in this estimate. The probate of the defendant's father's will had been put in evidence, and it proved that the defeadant was not the wealthy person he had pretended to be. The will was in favour of the defendant, his mother, and two sisters; the property was to be divided among them, and the brewery business between the defendant and his mother. The probate duty was under 30,0001. The defendant being entitled only toone quarter of that sum, it was impossible that his business could bave been estimated as worth 50,0001. Supposing him to have made this representation, there was enough before the jury to have checked its extravagance. It was proved that he had ordered two carriages-a phaeton and pair, and a brougham to be drawn by one horse called the Emperor, and two men servants in chocolate-coloured livenres. It was quite clear that with such means as he bad nothing could he expected from such a start but ruin in two or three years; and if he had such extravagant propensities the young lady had had a lucky escape. There was an affidavit of Mr. Shaw, the solicitor of the family, that the whole amount that the defendant had received at his father's death, including the goodwill of his business, was not more than 11,0001. The defendant had been very mLuch attached to the young lady; but her feelngs towards him 'were not very dcfficult to ascertain.- At the age of 20 she appeared to be very prudent, and urged that there should be at first no absolute engagement. erom the first the defendant's mother must have objected to the match; and it was clear a difference must have arisen between the parties as to -who should be invited to the wedding. It was clear that the defendant's family had been slighted, and that the mother of the defendant thought the plaintiff's family despised tradespeople, and that an unpleasant feeling existed. The mother and sister of the defendant had not been invited to the wedding breakfast, which was likely to excite strong feeling; and, although Serjeant Byles had said this was not necessary or to be expected with such near relatives, he doubted whether, in any case, they could have attended without invitation; but it was clear that in this particular instance, where there had been some unpleasantness, without an invitation they could not attend, and the want of an invitation bad therefore caused a very unpleasant feeling. The defendant appeared to be a person of a hot and hasty temper, and advantage was talkei of that. He submitted that there were no circumstances of aravation in this case to increase the injury which the plaintiff had sustained by the breach of contract with her, or to enhance the damages, and that the damages were excessive.
Mr. M. CHAmBIRS, Q.C., and Mr. PRENTICE followed on the same side, contending on the affidavits that the defendant's circumstances were not such as to warrant such damages; that the defendant was a working brewer, getting up at 5 in the morning to go to his work, and wearing an apron, and being often obliged to work till 11 at night, which accounted for his mother's objection to his living at a house a mile from his brewery; and with regard to the mode in which the match had been broken off and MIr. Smith ordered out of the house the defendant hadi been previously greatly exasperated by being told that his grandfather was a carpeter. and by Mir. Smith callfng him " Thomas Woodflne, Esq.," which accounted for the defendant's expressed desire that he should not visit his house after the marriage, and which broke off the match. The parties had never met after that unhappy interview. Then c-ame the attorney's letter, which put an end to all love-making. Under these circumstances it was submitted that the damages were excessive, and that there ought to be a new trial.
Mr. Justice CRB$SSWXLL in delivering judgmaent, said he was of opinion that the rufe must be discharged. It was not at all disputed that the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict - but it was said that the damages were too much, and that the Court ought to grant a new trial. He was far from denying that there might be cases in which the Court ought to interpse to set aside a verdict. If it had beenuascertained tiat any perjury had been committed on the part of the plaintiff, no doubt that would be a ground for setting9 aside the verdict. If it had appeared that thereowas an evidence calculated to take the defendant by surprise, and which the defendant, being surprised, had no opportunity of answering, it might be said that he had not a fair opportunity of stating his case before a jury. It was said here that there was surprise, and that the defendant was surprised at the amount at which his property was valued. But it seemed that the principal evidence as to his
roperty were his own statements, and which were not now enied, and the wlll of his father, which the plaintiff had given in evidence. It could not, therefore, be said that the plaintiff had artfully relied on the defendan's statements, and had abstained from giving any other evidence she had in her power, in order to mislead the jury. Itwas the defendant's duty to have been prepared to meet these statemnents, for they were always entered into. It would be a
futie and idle proceeding to send this case dowgn to tria again on that subject, because the same evidence must be re-
peated. Itwasthe defendant's own faultif exaggeratedstatements had been putbefore the jury. There was no perjury and no surprise, and he did not find any suggestion that the jury had acted under any prejudice, nor that they had misunderstood the evidence laid before them, but the Court were called upon to estimate the damages at something less
than the jury had done, which he thought was unconstitutional, and he was strongly impressed withthe opinion that it was what the Court ought not to do,
Ir. Justice WITtES having given a similar judgment concurring in this view,
The rule wvas discharged.
(Sitings at Nisi Prius, at Westminster before Mr. Justice
CutOwVDEn and a Comsnom Jury.)
The Court was occupied during the day in disposing of the case of "Patten v. Rea," vhich was what is usually called " a running down case." The evidenco was of an ex-
tremely contradictorynature, and thedotails of the trialwereo very uninteresting. It appeared that a horse of the plaintiff was on the 22d of' November last killed in Gracechurchatreet, by the shaft of a pony chaise penetrating the chest of the animal. This pony chaise was alleged to be the property of the defendant, who is the owner of the horse repository opposite the Elephant and Castle,in the Borough,
and was said to have been at the time of the occurrence under the care of one of his servants. For the defence it was urged that the vehicle identified by the witnesses for the plaintiff was not the one which caused the accident, and that even if it were so it did not belong to the defendant.
The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff-Damages, 311.
Mr. XChambers,Q.C.,andIr. Joye ewere counselfor the plaintiff, and Mr. Atherton, Q.C., and Mr. Barnardappeared for the defendant.

Thebrig Camilla, of the burden of 175 tons, left London on the 26th of August last, laden with a general cargo, bound for Algoa Bay. At 2 a.m. on the 3d of September, when about 15 miles from St. Catherine's light, in the Isle of Wight, she descried the Christiana, a little on her lee bow, d-istnt about a mile. The wind was blowing a moderate breeze from about north by west, the night was fine but hazy on the horizon, and the brig was heading west by north, close hauled, on the starboard tack. The Christiana, according to the representations of the brig, was observed coming up Channel, steering east on the port tack, with the wind free, approaching the brig. A light was immediately shown on the lee side of the brig, but the Christiana continuing to approachher she was hailed to port her helm. No notice bemgtaken of it the brig ported her helm, and came up into the wind until her sails shook. Immediately afterwards the two vessels came into collisien, in consequence of whichthe brig sustained considerable damage. The Christiana, of the burden, of 666 tons, laden with oil, flour, &c., sailed from Mew York on the 2d of August, bound to London, and, according to her account, a short time before the collion she observed a light, distant about a mile and about 2:: points on her starboard bow. She thereupon put her helm down, by which her head was brought to east by north, close to the wind. The vessel carrying the light
lavinf passed under the lee of the Christiana, the helm was porte in order to bring her back to her course. While the helm was still to port, and the ship not properly under control, the brig was discovered about one point under the Christians's lee bow, without any light visible on any part of her, and not more than a quarter of a mile off. The brig having a leading wind was hailed to alter her conrse, of which she took no notice until she was close under the Christiana's bows, when she suddenly ported her helm, and attemptedto cross the Christiana's bows, in doing which she struck her with great force on the port bow. The wind, as contended by the Christiana, was blowing from the northnorth-east, and not from north by west. Croes actions were entered by the respective parties.
The ADxmIALTY-ADVOCATE and Dr. Srcys were heard for the Camilla; the QuEEN's ADvocATEa and Dr. DEAXNE for the Christians.
The - learned JUDGE, after conferring with the Elder Brethren, by whom he was assisted, said, they were of opinion that the Christiana had the wind free, and was to blame for the collision; that no blame attached upon the Camilla.
Decree accordingly.
COURT OF BANKRUPTCY, Basinghall-street, Jan. 17.
COURT OP BANKRUPTCy, Ba,inWha&trea, Jan. 17.
IN RE ROBERT JOERNSTO AM .TAifyVQ -, I
(Before Mr. Oommitf -r, - i
The bankrupts were described as merchants of Billitersguare. The separate accounts of Johnston, as prepared by Messrs. Glover and Griffiths, extend from August 29, 1854, to Augus 1, 1856, and contain the following items :-Dr. To liabilities, 45,7651L ; sundry creditors, 4501. ; creditors holding security, 3,6561.; moiety of debts due on jnint account, 1,0951.; balance on 29th of August, 1854, being date of marriage settlement (after settling on Mrs. Johnston 38,1061.), 5,3761. Or. Joint estate of Johnston and Pratt, 9451. ; securities with creditors, 8,4701.; cost of marriage settlement, 1751. ; rent of house in Hill street and servants' wages, 2601 The creditors holdimg security include Mr. George Smith, solicitor, Chancery-lane, who holds a charge on certain estates in the city of Dublin in which the bankrupt had ai interest as tenant for life. Mr. Smith's claim is entered at 1,0751. and the securities are " estimated" at 8,4701. They include four bonds of John Binden Scott, 3,4701.; post obit bond of John Dean Paul, 1,0001.; and 3,0001. in the hands of John Adams. Mr. Samuel Adams, banker of Ware, as a secured creditor for 2,5601., holds lease of No. 36, Hil-street, Berkeley-square; also of Oak-lodge, Falham. There is a liability on bill endorsed for the Earl of Glengall for 1,1001.; 1,000. being paid offL
This was an adjourned examination meeting.
Mr. BAGLEY (who a opeared for Mr. W. Kay) said, the case of the bankrupt Johnston was a remarkable one-remarkable even in this court. The bankrupt, Mr. Johnston -better known as Captain Johnston at the Army and Navy Club-although it appeared from an investigation of his accounts that he had but very small means at the begmnning, had lived with all the outward and visible signs of affluence for a number of years; for it often happened in this countr7 that the appearance of wealth was as effectual in enabling persons to enjoy it-at least for an interval-as the absolute possession of wealth itself. Mfr. Johnston kept carriages and hunters. He had a house in Hill-street, Berkeley-square * a country house at Feltham, near Hounslow; and a third house in the Rue Castiglio
Paris. He moved in the aristocratic circles. So things went on till April, 1855. He had given an order to a tradesman to make a greenhouse for 8001. The greenhouse was erected, and, he supposed, enjoyed by the aristo. cratic proprietor. But the tradesman, not being satisfied with the honour of having erected the greenhouse for Captain Johnston, wanted his money, and Captain Johnston being unable to pay was arrested and conducted to prison. Immediately other tradesmen who had supphed Captain Johnston with luxuries lodged detainers. Captain Johnston remained qunet in the Queen's Bench one year. He then petitioned the Insolvent Court, and filed a schedule, from which it ap-
led he had creditors to the amount of 119,5001., for 80,0001 of which he stated he had received no consideration. He was appointed to come up in the Insolvent Court on the 18th of June, 1856, but being opposed by creditors he declined to go throuLgh that ordeal, and returned to prison, but very soon was discharged, and his creditor, Mr. Kay, wanted to know bow he was discharged, as he had not obtained his discharge from the Court. The bankrupt now said that Mr. Orlando Webb, solicitor, of Bedford-rowv, had purchased the debts of his detaining creditora -some for 5s. in the pound, some for l0s. in the poundand then discharged him. Captain Johnston being thus discharged on the 1st of August, Mr. Webb presented a petition for adjudication of bankruptcy against him in this court; and Mr. Webb, having proved his debt, chose himself aSsignee. The Court might be surprised to learn what the trade was for which Mr. Johnston was declared bankrupt. He had described himself in his petition filed in the Insolvent Court as " a gentleman in no trade or business," and his friends at the west-end would oerbaps be stprised to find that this gentleman,
ressed in the nmould of fashion, had come to this court as a dealer in fish-whether it was in herrings or sprats he dealt was not particularly stated, but the trade was said to have been the export of a cargo of fish from Scotland to Spain, which fish, it was stated, when it arrived at the Spanish port, was so unsavoury that the authorities declined to allow it to be landed; so that the only trade speculation in whichCaptain Johnston was engaged was a total failure, and his friends should not suppose that he had soiled his hands by the produce of any gains made by trade. He now came up to pass his accounta. He was asked to give accounts of his cash receipts and disbursements, of bill transactions, and of horses and carriages which he had possessed, and his answers to the requisitions were that he had kept no books, and was unable to furnish such accounts. Under these circumstances, it was suggested that he should be adjourned stne die, with liberty to come up when he should be able to furnish satisfactory accounts. In his answers to these requisitions, furnished on behalf of Mr. Kay, he admitted that A sum of 32,0001. was decreed in the Rolls' Court against him (Johnston) as duefto[Kay in a suit pending before the Master of the RoUs; but the bankrupt said that Mr. Kay owed him a larger sum than 32,0001., but that Mr. Kay availed himself of the plea of infancy. It so
peared, however, that in his printed bill it was expressly stated on the part of Mir. Kay that he had waived all objections on the ground of infancy, and was willing that his account should be taken on the footing that Johnston should be allowed an account of all moneys he had paid on account of Mr. Kay; and the Master of the Rolls, in his
udgment,referre with approval to the course taken by Mr. Kay's advisers, as being founded alike upon wisdom and honour. Theintroduction,therefore, ofthisstatementthat Mr. Kay had set up the defence of infancy was wholly unfounded, and could only have been set up for the purpose of givng offence.
Ir. LAWIRANCE, as representing Mr. Orlando Webb, said that he had never seen the answers to the requisitions, or he would have protested against the offensive insinuations contained in them, which were very ill advised on the part of the bankrupt. He thought that the bankrupt could not passupon.hisprsnt accounts, because no doubt he ought to debit himrself with Mr. Kay's debt, even if he had a setoff as suggested.
The bankrupt was put in the box. His aristocratic contour was in perfect accordance with the statements of the learned couedse. He had given the answers produced to requisitions which had been presented.
On reference to the requisitions it appears that the bank. rupt was arrested on the 24th of July, 1855, and fled a balance sheet in the Insolvent Debtors' Court, showing debts 119,5131., of which 81,8441. were without consideration. The amount of charge allowed against him in the suit "Kay v. Johnston" was 32,0001. The bankrupt denies that a bond to Samuel Adams dated June 3, 1854, for securing the payment of 12,2561., was set aside on the ground of fraud and cancelled by decree of the Master of the Rolls. The bonds he states were set aside on the plea of infancy. He denies a claim by Mr. Kay for4,6001., andaffirms that he has a claim upon Mr. Kav of nearly 4G,0001. He states that he does not know that the effects at Oak-house produced 2,1591. The property included a greenhouse of the value of 8001. He states that he does not know that the furniture in Hill-street was valued at 3,8471. It was utterlyimpossiblefor him to furnish certain accounts, as he kept no books whatever. This inability extended to any power to furnish particnulas of all horses, carriages, and household furniture for a specified period.
Mr. BAGLLY proceeded to state that the bankrupt had efrected a marriage settlement upon Mrs. Kay for 38,0001., and that there were no assets for this Court to administer. B ra tcy not having beenadjudicated within two months of the g of the petition in the Insolvent Court, any proPertythat the ankrupt might have possessed was vested in *Jesrovisional assignee of the Insolvent Court.

The COMUSSIONER-What could a Leicester mRn knoW about curing fish? It was a singular speculation for Mr. Webb to aid, or in any way to embark in.
After some further discussion, during which Mr. Webb sugested that the bankrupt might be allowed to pass.
His Hotout ordered au adjournment sine die, with pro. tection to the 28th of February. He did not think t'iat the bankrupt ought to pass his examination until the petition to the Insolvent Court had beon heard.

An opposition was offered by a creditor named Pottinger, who had advanced the insolvent 1501. upon a mortg e of the Atlas Brewery, St. Johnstreet-road. amed the chief ground of complaint was a vexaious defence, whereby the plainti's costs had been incrersed by about 301.
The insolvent, wvho had been clerk to the Mlarriage Lawv Reform Aseociation, with a salary of 1201. a-year, attributed his insolvency to the failure of his brewing speoa-

Mr. SARGOODZ on behalf of the insolvent, asked for an adjournment. A15 chent had been a director of the Saxon IMte Assurance Society, and in that capacity might be liable for some claims upon that body, and time was required to consider whether it was necessary to insert any other creditors in the schedule.

ALICE GRAY AGAIN.-On Friday, at the Leeds
AMicE GRAY AGAIN.-On Friday, at the Ieeds Courthouse, Eliza Tremaine, alias "the Yorkshire Alice Gray," alias Hook, alis Teale, alias Smith, was charged with obtaining money by false representations from Mr. John Cloagh, of the Bridge Inn, Ferry-hil, Darham. Eliza ig the same woman who so successfunll imwosed upon lr. Smedley, of the Matlock Bath hydropathio establishment, several months ago, by representing herself as the daughter of the Rev. Dr. nooc Ticar of Leeds, and stating that she left her home because her religious principles were opposed to those of her famnily and friends. On that occaion the imposition was not 'discovered until Mr. Smeoasl took her to Leeds, and placed her face to face w ,ifl Z. D ook, at the vicarage. Eliza escaped unishment at that time, and went again on bertravels. After heing variously imprisoned in the midland and southern countes sbe suddenly turns up at Drham, where she has just succeeded in playing off & moet impudent hoax. From the statement of Mr. Clo6gh it appeared she represented herself a the-7eveof Mr. Hutton, of soberry-hi22, Thirak; that 'her fatber-mai,)holic. and hermoter Prtesan; that 'when heri.bitAwrVa dying. she requested thathher d er'mghti d in the

POLICE.
GOILDRALL.-Mr. S. E. P. Barber, the secretary to the Samaritan Institution, appeared to answer the charges made paginsi hitm of obtaiing goods under false pretences.
It will be remembered that on the last hearing of this important matter Mr. Barber was taken suddenly ill during the examination and was carried from the court in a fainting condition, since which, according to thesaugeon's report, the excitenient and mental anxiety arisiag from the charge that had been brought against him had produced an attack of r,gi R eceo,fis, and left him in such a precarious state as to preclude the possibility of his attending court until this day. The case had beem appointed for 1 o'clock, but the alderman did not make his appearance until past 4 o'clock, when it was stated by Mr. Greatorex, his medical attendant, that Mr. Barber, after remaining in court for three hours, was now so exhausted that he could not answer for his life if he were to remain any longer
Sir R. W. CARDnN said, he could not think of proceeding under such circumstances with the examination.
The case was then adjourned for a week.
Bow-sTrREEzr.-John Macdonald, a suiddle-aged man, was charged with stealing two checks upon the London and Westminster Bank for 701., and thereby defrauding his employer, Mr. Frewer, saddler, of Southampton-row, Russell. square.
The checks were drawn by Mr. Bellingham, a neighbour of the prosecutor's, and had been filled up with the amoun ts respectively of 36t1. 5s. and 341., the date being left blank. It was explained that Mr. Bellingham was in the habit of giving Mr. Frewer checks in this way in exchange for other checks, in order that the prosecutor might obtain the cash, at his convenience, at the Bloomsbury branch of the bank, where Mx. BeUingham had an account; and the two checks in question were abstracted from a desk on Wednesday last, and dated and presented the sane afternoon by the prisoner, who absconded afterwards with the money. He was apprehended on Friday night by Brooks (a coustable in private clothes), who found 481. in his possession, the "balance '- having been disposed of.
The prisoner had written a letter promising to make up the deficiency if timo were permitted.
Mr. HaEsRY committed the prisoner for triaL His worship advised the prosecutor to keep an account at the bank rather than pursue his present system of keeping in hand checks already filled up. A. tradesman might keep an account, however small, at any of the banks now-a-
r. Frewer said, the London and VWestminster would charge ol. per cent, on all accounts under 1501.
Mr. Heci-RY has received 51. from "F. L. B." (per Contts and Co.), and l0s. in postage stamps from " B." for the poorbox.
WESTIMINSTER.-George Thomas Sambrook, aged 18, a young man of forbidding appearance, was charged with feloniously attempting to stab Mr. Thomas Aexander Young, brewer at tr. Thorne's, Westminster ale and porter brewery, Earl-street, Horseferry-road.
r. Younlg said, that on Friday evening he was in the brewery, near the lodge, when he saw the prisoner, who was a labourer there, and who had been suspended for a week for misconduct, coming from the direction of his (Mr. Young's) kitchen. He asked him where he had been, when prisoner informed him that " he had just been to bid his servant, Susan, good bye." Witnems remarked that he had been previously forbidden to go into his house, and had no roght to do so without leave; and, upon prisoner's instantly replying, " Well, and I have been without leave," witness informed him that he might consider himself discharged. Prisoner immediately opened a large clasp knife, and, rushing upon witness, aimed at the left side of his body. Witness stepped back a pace, and, just as the sharp point of the knife had perforated his coat and waistcoat and was pressing against his ribs, seized the accused by the arm, and arrested the further progress of the weapon. Witness called loudly for help, and a labourer named Stevenson caine and endeavoured to hold prisoner from behind, witness still tightly grasping his right arm. Prisoner then passed the knife into his left band and made a desperate thrust at witness's stomach, but he saw the movement, and averted it by throwing himself back. He (Mr. Young) then continuedto str gle with the prisoner until he made a third backhanged blow at him with the knife, which he warded off, and then receded a few paces, followed by the prisoner, who in his fury dragged Stevenson with him. Assistance was then called and the prisoner dropped the knife.
Mr. ARNOLD inquired of Mr. Young what would have been the effect of the thrust in his opinion, considering the force used, if he had failed in catching hold of the prisoner's arm on the occasion of the first attack?
Mr. Young replied that the wlhole length of the blade must have entered his body. He begged to add, that when prisoner first rushed upon him he exclaimed "That he might as well die at i as at last, or as be starved."
Mr. ARXOLD inquired whether Mr. Young could form a notion of what might have been the effect of the second blow if he had not been fortunate enough, by f'inging himself backc, to escap it?
Mr. Young said,it must have entered the lower part of the abdomen and ripped him up.
James Stevenson stated that he heard a cry for assistance, and saw Mr. Young and the prisoner scuiffling. Mr. Young exclaimed, " He's got a knife !" Witness seized prisoner, but he got partially away from him and followed Mr. Young, and then witness saw him drop the knife.
Mrs. Caroline Ferriman, of 2, ArtiUlery-row, said she went to the brewery on business, and was sitting in the lodge. At the conclusion of the scuffle she saw the prisoner drop the knife partly open. She picked it up, and in doing so it closed, when the prisoner exclaimed, " If you go and say that knife was open I'll do something for you when I am at liberty."
Police-constable John Aiteheson, 192 B, said, he took the prisoner into custody. On the way to the station he said,
I may as weU be hanged or transported as starved."
Prisoner, who made no defence, was remanded for a -week.
WOnsscrIP-sTRE-r.-On Thursday a poor woman named Martha ltatciffe was charged at this court, at the instance of a constable of the N division, with being houseless and destitute, she being found huddled up in the cold on the pavement at the gate of St. Luke's workhouse at a very late hour the night before, and been refused admission by the porter.
On that occasion the constable stated that on knocking at the gate to obtain the woman's admittance he was refused by a pauper, who acted as porter, and who slammed the wicket in his face; that he then saw one Mattocks or Maddocks, the acting porter, who also refused to admit her, alleging he had directions from the board of guardians to do so, the wonian havig soluntariy discharged herlf a short time before; and thalt'he was therefore obliged to take her to the police-station and charge her as above, his feelings not letting hite allow a fellow-creature to be any longer so exposed to the inclemency of the weather, and the woman herself stating that if she had been allowed to stay there much longer she felt satisfied she would have lost her life. Three officers, including two sergeants, described the scenes they had frequently witnessed at the workhouse gate as ceost distressing, and as well calculated to excite the indignation they each expressed. One of the warrant-officers was despatched to the workhouse to obtain the attendance of some one to explain the matter or excuse it, and the two sergeants pult themselves to great inconvenience by waiting about the court till its close to mieet any such statement, lbut no one attended from the 'Workhouse, it being intimated that the miaster of the house 'Would attend on Saturday. Oin that day,therefore, Mr. Church'warden Fisher, vice.'chairman of the board, Mr. Croad, a guar. dian, M1r. Charles Alberry, late clerk to the board, one of the overseers, and Mr. Henry Legg, the master, were in attend. ance, and Hayward, the waranti-officer, having introduced the subject,
Mr. HAMAULL said, -Yea, I perfectly recollect the woman was stated to have been lying there for hours, and when the constable applied forhler admission the porter refused it.
Mr. Lemg-Isliould have comnplied withi your request, Ssr, and attended, but from having to attend upon three 4COmmittees ; and with regard to the womnan Ratoliffe, I beg to say that she has been an habitual vagrant for years past, and is known to us, and, I believe, most other workhouses in the metropolis. She was an inate of St. Lutke's fromi July last to the followving October, when she insisted upon her discharge. The Porter insists that somne one gave hi,,, instructionis to deny her admission, in the event of her applying again. but I can onlY say I am confident no such directions cam'e from the beard, and I repudiate having So acted imyself. Although I cannot help saying she is one of the isst who slioimld be attended to, I niust express my regret she should have been kept SO long waiting.
Mr. HAx11o1utL.-I nmut say I was certinily greatly surPrised at hearing it stated that the beard had given such an order, and, dis-crediting it, called for the attendance of souse one to explai t If iti'tefut of the porter, it is clear be is no longer fit for his office.
Mr. eg.I was certainy not the Paid porter who so acted.
Mr. HAMM5LL.-Whoever it was, such conduct may occur again, unless the mnan 1who practised it is removed. ,Seppose thlis womian had died of starvation and cold, wl,at a position the board of guardians would have been in!I lhave seldom heard of such conIPlaints against St. Luk-e's, anid I repeat that I was suprised ; but it does not appear to have been a single complaint, for Sergeants Harvey and Heath, of the G and N division, distinctly stated that similar scenes freqUently Occurred.
Mr. Legg.- l have not beard such complaints for mnonths, Sir, nior can I credit that cause for suceh shiould exist without mny hearing themn. In certain caes delay is absolutely requisite.
Mr. Croad.-I am fearful, Sir, from the report in The :Tit=c, some misrepresentation has been made by the police about the numbers seen by them at the gates.
MNr. HA5i5j5ILL.-Verv wefll; is SegatHarvey or the constable who took the harge here ?
Sergeant Townshend.-No, bir, but Sergeant Heath is.
Sergeant Heath.-I have seen 'persons there, youir worship, as I represented before, frequently ; wlny, the knocker of their gate is seceured after 9 o'clock at night.
Mr. LegP.-It is after 10 o'clock, but in consequence of the
numbers returning from places of amusement and publichouse at a late hour exciting a disturbanco by knocking, aud the knocker is very ponderous.

tor. Legg.-There is always a person just inside the gate to attend.
Sergeant Heath.-Why, Sir, I have actually knocked at th gte w-ith my truncheon for att-ention, in vain. We
have no trouble in these matters with the Shorediteh house.
Mr. HAOiOSILL.-Wel, I have caled attention to this
matter, and trust the board will see how their orders have been abused, for it is evident there is great fault somewhere.
After some observations upon the case of two women sent by Sir R. W. Ci.rden from Guildiall to this court, they
alleging the authorities of St. Luke's had refused to admit them, but who were at once admitted,
Mr. Croad said,-I think it is very hard if we are compelled to take in all able-bodied paupers who apply as

Two determined-1ooking men, named William Merry and
Charles Haynes, were charged with having stolen three valuable gold rings from the shop of Mr. Simmonds, a jeweller in High-street, Stoke Newington. It appeared that the twio prisoners went into the prosecutor's shop and asked to look at some rings. A tray was set before them, when the pdsoner Haynes was seen by the prosecutor's wife to abstrmt three of them and secrete them under his sleeve. Without taking any notice of what she bad seen, she sent the elTandboy for a policeman, and directed the sbo,Anan to securn the front door to prevent their escape. A policeman came and took the prisoners into custody, and when they were searched the stolen rings were found in the possession of Merry. The prisoners were identified as notorious thieves, both of whom had been previously convicted of a similar robbery, and had been respectively sentenced to seven years' transportation, bat had been sabsequently libersted under a ticket of leave. They were remanded for the depositions.

Chancery Imprisonment In England.
CHANCERY IdlPRISONMENT IN ENGLA ND.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,- We now hear and read much respecting imprison. ment for criminal offences, but nothing as to incarceration for "contempt of coart."
I noticed in your report, a day or two since, of the case of" Marsh v. Goodall," in the Rolls Court, the Master of the Rolls made an order for the committal to prison of a lady, Jane Goodall, and another person, W. (Goodall, for some alleged disobedience of an order of the Court as to the receipt of rents, &a. I am entirely ignorant of the parties, bnt having myself, through the kindness of Vice-Chancellor Kindersley, escaped incarcera'ion on the eve of the long vacation, I am desirous of directing te attention of the public to this monstrous and disgraceful relic of the ancient Star Chamnber, and of the mode in which this power is exercised and carried ont.
When the punishment (sometimes imprisonment for life) is the same as for the greatest crime one would suppose that "contempt of cou.t" implied some gross insult to the judge on the benob, or some unpardonable infringemont of the dreorun necessary for conducting the business of the court ; but far from it; the offence may be the omission to comply with some stipulation for the advantage of one of the plaintiffs, mixed up with various other stipulations in the order, entirely a personal matter, in a civil proceeding between some of the parties in the sui', and not affecting the dignity and honour of the Court, except as respects the order for directing the conduct of the parties to each other.
The manner in which this highest penal power'of the Court is exercised is a perfect mockerv, a scandal, and a cruelty ; the groundwork of the writ of attachment or warrant for commital is t. e wretched system of bill and answer, with affidavitson both sides; the motion for the writ is made after four days' notice, which, in reality, is little betterthan two-a period totaUy insuffic:ent for the purpose; the power is delegated to the party applying for the attachment, he may have vindictive feelings to gratify, he obtains it without the knowledge of bis co-plaintiffs, he makes us -of their names in the writ, holds the order over as long as he likes, refrains from applying for the writ until the moment he can bestgratify his revenge ; while the unfortunate victim, unable to ascertain, and uncertain whether the writ is in the hends of the officers, incapacitated drring this period from doing anything towards the requirements of the order, is at last consigned to a prison, without being brought before the Judge under whose order he is committed; the offence is unhailable, to prison he must go, with but little chance there of beig able to accomplish that which he was unable to do
I assert, and ani prepared to prove, that these tyrannical proceedings are delegated to a private individual, whose feelings and passions may prompt him to as bad an exercise of them as has happened in the early ages of the omnipotent powers of the Court of Chancery. The criminal law is far less severe when the whole community is concerned. The magistrate, by his warrant, enforces the appearance before him of the party disobeying his surrmons or order, when he may explain the cause of his contempt. So I maintain it ought to be in the Court of Chaneery. It should first be an inquiry whether some other mode more suitable to the present times coald not be adopted for insuring obedience to orders and decreeswhether a fine ought not to be substituted according to the degree of transgression; the costs, in fact, at present are in addition to the imprionlllent; but in no case should the party be committed to prison without previoasly being brought before the judge in whose court the carse may bh depending, and more especialy the Court should keep in
its own hands, and after due personal inquiry and examination, the enforcement of the rights of the parties, and not leave the infliction of its punishments to the complainant to carry it out as may best suit his feelings.
I refrain from entering into my own case, but as it may not happen to every ore to meet with the kindness which I experienced, or to be able to adopt the same expensive efforts which I did, I, in conclusion, earnestly direct aitention to this subject, which I am sure only requires to
be properly brought forward to be immediately and indignantly remedied; and, enclosing my naie and address subscribe myself, Yonr a d

The Bullion Robbery.
THE BULLION ROBBERY.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Many of your readers may bave been surprised that the WOrst of the three criminals who were tried for the bullion robbery should have escaped with a comparatively light sentence, and mey not he sorry to learn how it happans that there should be thi apparent defect inour criminal code.
A distinction hasalways been madebetweensimplelarceny and larceny by a servant, the latter, in consqene nof the abuse of confidence with which it is attende beig treated as a graver offence, bit it was not until lately that the difference in the punishment assigned for eh of those offences was so marked as at present it is.
The 7th end Sth of George IV., chap. 29, sec. 3, enacted that any person convicted of simple larvceny should be liable to be transported for seven years, or to be imprisored for any tern noe exceeding two years, and, if a male, to be once, twice, or thrice publily or privatly whipped (if the Coua
should so think fit), in addition to such imprisonmient. This was the law for a considerable timne, and woald probably be so now but for the harshness of country justices, who, fonid, I suippose, of exhibiting the extent of their power, were in the constant habit of ssntencing every unfortuinate wretch whio was dragged before tbem for committing somie petty theft to be transported for seven years.
Petitions flocked in for an enactment which should put a stop to this cruel exercise of power, and the 12th of Vintoria, c. 11, was the result. By section 1 of this act it is provided that fromi and after the 1st day of May, 1849, so inuch of the 7th and 8th of George IV., c. 29, as rmakes any person convicted of simple lai -eny liable to be transported for seven years shall be repealed ; but that every person so convicted shall he liable, at tie discretion of the Court, to be othlerwise punished as by the said act is provided.
The addition of hard labour and solitary confinement wherea convict is sentenced to imnprisonment is provided for by the 4thl section of the 7th and 8th Geor-ge IV., chap. 29, as amended by the 7th William IV., and 1st Victoria, chap. 90, sec. 5, by which latter it is enacted " that from anxd after the 1st of October, 1837, it shall not be la 2- ful for any court to direct that any offender shall be kept in solitary confinemient for any longer periodi than one monkh at a timne, or than thiree wronths in the space of one year."
it was proved r,t the trial that Pierce was not, at the time of the robbery, a servant of the company, and there. fore lie could only be found guilty upon the count in the in. dietusient charging him with simple larceny.
The learnied Judge might have awarded that tlhree months in ech earof is mispisomen shuldbe passed in solitary confnemet, ut tose ho re fmilar with the horrors, and een dngerto lfe an reaon, f ths moe of pu nish ment wil not howverindinanttheymayfeel against 1'irce rerettl'ittheJude, n is iscetin,so far miti-

THE LOSS OF THE TYNYE.
The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty have much satisfaction in making known the h^ndsome and generous manner in which 3tr. Edonard Pecher, Consul-General of His Majesty the King of the Belgians at Rio Janeiro, bas conferred a donation of 5001. on Henry Bath, chief boatman in the Coastguard service, and in charge of the St. Alban's station, for his good and brave conduct in proceeding to the assistance of the Royal Mail steamer Tyne. The following are Mr. Pecher's letter to Commodore Eden, the Controller-General of the Coastguard service, and their Lordships' reply; and the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty have also had much satisfaction in promoting ifenry Bath to be a chief officer in the Coastguard service, as a mark of their appreciation of his excellent conduct.

"Sir,-I was passenger on board the Royal Mail Steampacket Company's steamer Tyne, Commander Valler.
" While the steamer was bhmping violently on the beach 'Henry Bath, chief boatman, Coastguard station, St. Alban's Head, came on board to render assistance.
" On seeing our eri' -i position he might have returned immediately on shore, but he remained with as, and all th, passengers adnmred his manly behaviour. By his presence he gave confidence to all.
"I happened to be saved in the lifeboat steered by Henry Bath, and on reaching shore I promised him 5001. as a token of my admiration at his noble conduct and of my gratitude for the service he had rendered me. It is my duty to add that this noble heart refused the sum I offered him, finding it too great, and out of proportion with the merit of his conduct; but, knowing that he is the father of fou r children, I persevere the more in my firt intention, and beg to inform you, Sir, that I have instructed my bankers, Messrs. Frederick Huth and Co., in London, to pay to him, or to the Coastguard-office for account of Henry Bath, the said sum of 500l.
" I must add that the men rowing the boat which brought Henry Bath on board the Tyne showed much courage and devotedness; they saved a great number of passengers, and the Coastguard-office may be proud of having such noble servants.
"II would in no manner have it that the expression of my gratitude towards Henry Bath might appear as a sort of blame for worthy and respectable Captain Valler and his valiant officers.
"They and the crew did their duty manfully. The greatest order reigned on board, and never shall I think with soreness on those courageous but unhappy men.

Newgate, Past And Present.
NEWGATE, PAST ANfD PRESENT.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-An accidental circumstance-the unjust infiction of the penalty of the law upon an innocent man, "John Mark. ham"-has, through a letter from the ex-sheriff, Mr. Rose, disclosed to public view some of the long-existent and abounding abominations of Newgate.
You have rendered good service to the cause of humanity and justice by the manner in which you have in The Times of yesterday brought prominently under notice the case of John Markham.
It is not my intention to dweU upon that part of the question, and I will leave it to tell upon the public mind through the various pubhc organs which are so effectually taking up the subject.
I would rather desire permission to endeavour, as briefly as possible, to direct further attention to Newgate in a concise historical review of what it has been as a penal institution for the last 70 or 80 years, from which it will be seen that, whatever may have been the moral improvement which has taken place in the metropolis, N'ewgate has continued to be the very centre and focus of moral pestilence and degradation.
The witnesses who have given eviden ce in the case are of the highest class and of the most unexceptional character, and their statements cannot fail to make a deep impression on the public mind. I purpose commencing with-
John Howard, the philanthropist, in 1787, who, when referring to Newgate, states,-
"There was no alteration since his former publication. In three or four rooms there were nearly 150 women crowded together, many young creatures with the old and hardened, some of whom had been confined upwards of two years. On the men's side there were many boys of 12 or 14 years of age, some almost naked. In the men's infirmary there were only seven iron bedsteads, and at my last visit, there being 20 sick, some of them, naked, and with sores in a miserable condition, lay on the floor with
Sir Richard Philips, a sheriff of London in 1808, in a letter to the livery of London upon the state of Newgate, observes-
"Those only committed for trial, those actually convicted, hardened and first offenders, the profligate and the evil disposed, the innocent and the guilty, ought not to be mingled indiscriminately together. WThile this is the peractice ewgate is necessarily little better than a public seminary of vice and for teaching the art of thieving. Iliave been shocked to see boys of 13,14, and 1-5 confined for two months together in the same yard with hardened and incorrigible offenders. Those committed for first or for small offences are constantly within this same sphere of moral contamination."
Relative to the female prisoners Sir Richard continues,"Among the women alltheordinary feelings of thesexare outraged by their indiscriminate association. The shameless victims of lust and profligacy are placed in the same chamber with others, who, however they may have offended the law in particular points, still preserve their respect for decency and decorum. In immediate contact with such abandoned women other young persons are compelledto pass their time between their commitment and the sessions when, of course, it often happens that the bil is not found against them by the grand jury, or they are acquitted by the petty jury."
It is unnecessary to dwell upon the deeply depraving influence of such a demoralizing contact.
Mrs. Elizabeth Fry visited Newgate in lS16, and it is thus described by the late Mr. T. B. Buxton:-
"She found the female side in a situation which no language can describe. NSearly 300 women, sent there for every gradation of crime, some untried, and some under sentence of death, were crowded together in the two wards and two cells which are now appropriated to the untried, and which are found quite inadequate to contain even this diminished number with any tolerable convenience. They slept on the floor, at times 120 in one ward, withoutsomuch as a matforbedding, and many of them were very nearly naked. She saw them openly drinking spirits, and her ears were offended with the most terrible imprecations. Everything was filthy to excess, and the smell was quite disgusting. Every one, even the governor, was reluctant to go among them. He persuaded her (Mrs. Fry) to leave her watch in the office, telling her that his presence would not prevent its being torn from her. She saw enough to convince her that everything bad was going on. In short, in giving me this account (Mr. Buxton says) she repeatedly said, 'All I tell thee is a faint picture of the realty; the filth, the closeness of the roonis, the ferocious mannersand expressions of the vomen towards each other, and the abundant wickedness whinheerti
bespoke are quite indescribable."' chs everything
Mr. Poynder, a name well known for benevolence, describes, in 1817, the state of the male side of the gaol:-
" The prisoner associates with the sanme companions, talks the same language, and enjoys the same vices to which he had been accustomed in the world. So far, therefore, as the criminal is concerned, he remains the same character still; nor is the general aggregate of crime lessened by his confinement, since it can be proved that, from the facility of intercourse between ihe interior and exterior of Newgate, some of the worst and most extensive burglaries and robberies have been plotted in that prison * forged notes have been fabricated and passed there, and coining itself has been carried on within its walls."
The same gentleman, furtherremarking on the then existing evils of the gaol, stated " that any man can be visited by any woman who chooses to inquire for him, and the mere mention of his name," Mr. Poynder continues, "is in the same way permitted to pass al those women who choose to apply for the purposes of general prostitution."
The presentment of the grand jury in 1820 is further declaratory of the enormous amount of mischief which the magistrates of the city of London were passively instrumental in inflicting upon the community:-
" The London grand jury respectfully beg leave to present to the Court that, in their opinion, the alarmmg increase of crime in the metropolis, especially among juvenile offenders, is to be chiefly attzi,ltable
to the very inadeq4nate state of Newgate prison for the purpose of clasmng the prisoners according to their various degrees of criminality; thus, boys and girls whohavebeencommittedfor some slight misdemeanours ara foand to ssociate with the baest and most hardened felons, and are conseq,uently returned upon society, when the periods of their imprisonment are passed, in possession of all the theory of the most practical offenders. the grand jury, therefore earnestly implore the Court to give their most serious and immediate attention to the deplorable state of Newvgate prison, and to adopt such measures as shsaU effectually remove this great discredit from the metropolis."
Would it not be imagined that after such a remonstrance some steps would have been taken to remedy the evils complained of ? Let us see what was the state of things 16years later.
The inspectors of prisons for the home district, in their report for 1S36, thus comment upon the gaol under notice:-
" The ssociation of prisoners of all ages and of every shade of guilt in one mdiscriminate mass is a frightful feature in the system thatprevails here; the ftrst in magnitude, and the most pernicious in effect. In this prison we find that the young and the old, the inexperienced and the practised offender, the criminnl who is smitten with a conviction of his guilt and the hardened vilain whom scarcely any penal discipline can subdue, are congregated together, with an utter disregard to all moral distinctions, the interests of the prisoners, or the welfare of the community. In such a state of things, can it be a matter of wonder that the effects should be such as have been described? Every other evil is aggravated by this ; and it would bo worse than idle to attempt any remedy for the rest while this most demorali2ing intermixture of criminals of all ages and degrees of guilt is suffered to frustrate the very ends of pnson discipline, and to give tenfold violence to alU those mischievous inchnations and passions upon which it is incessantly operating, and which it is the design of justice to discourage and repress. Every device by which the fences of property may be overcome is here framed and divulged toreadyagent. Every fraudulent artifice, every successful trc,eeyigenious mode of overreaching the cautious or plundering the unguarded, is perfected here, and communicated to those who had not hitherto been initiated in the mystery of crime."
In 1846, after an alUowance of a further 10 years of the depraving process, the inspectors make a renewed effort to awaken the attention of the City of London Gaol Committee to a sense of the evils inflicted both upon the imprisoned and the community by their disregard of the condition of Neowgate. In their tenth report the inspectors write:-
" An imperative sense of duty has compeled us year after year to remonstrate against Newgate as a most objectionable prison, and on the present occasion we have no alternative bat to reiterate our complaints against it. In whatever light we contemplate this prison we see in it a school where the juvenile and the immatured offender, or any one in whomtheremaybeyetsomesenseof virtueremainmng, is. by reason of a compulsory gaol association, perfected in the arts of crine, he result is inevitable. Here prisoners of various degrees of depravity are thrown into the most intimate companionship in numbers, varying from three to 19 hours of the 24, in utter idleness, and without even the restraining presence of an officer, and during the two hours allowed for exercise that sphere of association is prodigiously increased by the prisoners in the different wards being allowed freely to associate in the aring yards. That contamination goes on to a fearful extent in the wards and yards of Newgate is not a matter of conjecture or speculation, for every.day experience demonstrates it. It is no uncommon thing for young men committed to this prison for a first offence, although they may on entering evince deep and unfeigned sorrow for a short period, to recover rapidly from their depression of spirit. and give way to a reckless state of mind which soon boinds them in closest intimacy with the depraved and the old and oftcommitted depredator."
In the letter of Mr. ex-SheriffRose, publishedin The Times a few days since, there is a deplorable exhibition of the state of Newgate at the present moment, and I would beg to add his remarks to the chain of evidence against the disci'line of Newgate, and also against those who are respon. sile for its continuance. Mr. Rose, adverting to the association into which the innocent man, John Markham, was thrown, states-
" He was two months in Newgate picking oakum with the convicts there, who in this prison are aU in one room together-three murderers at one time, pirates who bad deliberately planned wholesale massacres, to be accompanied by indescribable atrocities; burglars, garotters, thieves from their birth, receivers, and puttersup of robberies, and the perpetrators of unmentionable crimes. The amusement of this den of devilry is to narrate their crimes and to plan fresh ones."
Is there not in this short paragraph but a reiteration of the statements made by every authority now presented from the time of Howard, in 1787, to the present period ?
Will you allow me one more reference? It will be a poetical allusion by the unfortunate Dr. Dodd, who it is wel known was confined in Newgate, and executed for forgery in 1777. In his Prion Tkohouhts there is the following :
" Is this the place
" Ordained by justice to confine awhile "The foe to civil order, and return
" Reformed and moralized to social life!
" This school of infamy ! from whence, improved
IIn every hardened viUany, returns
"More hardened, a foe to God and man,
"The miscreant narsed in its infectious Lap"All covered with its pestilential spots,
"And breathing death and poison wheresoe'er 'lHe talks contagious l"
Newgate has indeed been a den of devilry; the poetry of Dodd in 1777 and the prose of Mr. Rose in 1857 are identical in sentiment upon this point.
It is impossible to estimate the extent of evil diffosed among society by the continuation of a state of things such as referred to by Mr. Rose, as, according to a statement by the inspector of prisons, above 1,000 prisoners, youthful and adult, of all degrees of guilt, were in the course of three years confined in Newgate.
It is not intended to convey the idea that aU the evils adverted to now exist in aU their enormities; the different authorities quoted show the abominations which were permitted to exist at the respective dates furnished.
The inquiry wiU naturaUy be proposed,-Who were responsible for the proper management of the gaol, and who are now responsible for all " the devilry" which is now allowed to prevail in Newgate? The reply is,-The city prisons are " under the jurisdiction of the Lord Mayor and the Court of Aldermen. All the members of the court are considered visiting justices, but there is a rota appointed in order to secure (for visitation) their regular attendance."
The reslts of their regular attendance may be inferred from,the evidence adduced; but wiU it be believed that these visiting justices not only did not duly regard the representations which were made to them at various neriods and in various forms, but they actually exerted an official influence against information being given by the rev. ordinary, who was specially interdicted " from making any communication to the Home-office or to the inspectors of prisons upon the enormities which have been detailed? ' The following is a copy of the resolution:-
"Gaol Committee of Aldermen.
"' Friday, March 18, 1842.
"Resolved and ordered,-That the ordinary of Newgate be restricted from making any communications to the Home-office or inspectors of prisons, and that he be required wholly to confine himself to the performance of his duty as prescribed by act of Parliament.
Not only was the chaplain's mouth thus closed, but what official, from the governor to the lowest prison official, dare to say a word upon prison doings after such a resolution ?
WVhen the chaplain was further interrogated the inspectors remark, "H e inquired before he answered, whether he would not expose himself to penalties if he refused ? And being informed that he would, he then made a special request that we (the inspectors) would state in our report that he only replied to our interrogatories, and had not volunteered any statements." * Why all this detail, it maybe said :-It is to show the ban put upon authorized official inquiry, and that neither light nor truth would be permitted as to the real condition of the chief prison in the metropolis.
It is, however, right to state that all the aldermen were not equally chargeable with a disregard to the evils which have been commented upon. It is due to both Aldermen Sidney and Wilson to state, that they have raised their voice in the Court of Aldermen aainst the state of Newgate, and when these appeals have been made upon the condition of the prisoners, they were denominated as " humbngs,"+ a favourite term employed by Sir Peter Laurie when referring to the subject of Prison Discipline.
Lord Sandon. now the Earl of Rerrowbv. in 1846, was
so impressed with the depraving tendency of the discipline of the city gaols, that he gave notice that he should move for a committee to inquire into their condition and the treatment adopted therem. Since that period Giltspurstreet Compter has ceased to exist. Thus far has a moral pestilence been removed, but it would be found that there remains somewhat to inquire about in relation to Newgate.
Permit me to remark that it is upon public grounds I have ventured to refer upon the past and present of Newgate.
I have no desire to dwell unsuitably on the past in relation to Newgate, and would be inclined to say "Lt bygones be bygones," but when itis found that enormous evil resulting from gaol association of the worst description is stiU allowed there does appear to be sufficient ground for showing the flagrant neglect which has prevailed, and does now prevail
and it is high time for the. ji re to exercise its control for the application of the required remedies and for putting the gaol under other official superintendence.
A few days since the Lord Iayor desired Mr. Charles rearson to direct his attention to the present state of crime, &-c., when the City Solicitor promised to give his opinions npon " Pison diecipline, transportation, and ticket-of-
eave," &ac. Mr. Pearson would render essential public service if he would suggest some antidotes against the "clevilry" in Newgate.

"That whle this council fully admits the ncessity there existed during the late war with Russa for raIsing the propetly and iwometax from 7s1. to is. :. in the pound, it cosniders that the war being new at an end such part o e the aiove-m.ntined tax as was levied for the purpose of carrying It on sLhould be fortbwith aS'andoned. and re-

PRESTON.
In compliance with a numerocsly-signed requisition, the Mayor of Preston, ir. L. S emcer, convened a public meetirg of the inhabitants, for tbe purpose of toking into consideration the propricty of petitioning Parliament in the next session for the immedimte reduction of the income and property tac The weetitg, which compriged rqbout 1,200 persons of a11 classes, took place in the Corn Exchange, *.une-street, on Thursday evening, the Mayor in the chair. Besides many of the principal inhabitants of the town, there wrere upon the platform Ir. R. r. Parker and Sir (eorge Strickland, the nrembers for the borough, and Mr. J. Ieywood, one of the members for the northern division of Lancashire.
Mr. E. BIRLEY, manufacturer, moved-
" That as the income and property taxes were increased to Is. 4d. in the pound for the exigencies of the war, the law enacting that rate Ought in iutico to expiSe from the 5th of April next, being one yar after ioactual teminiation of the war."
Mr. AIXSWORTII, manufacturer, in seconding the motion, said that the Duke of Wellington in 1842 expressed himself as satisfied of the obnoxious nature of the taxc and powers of the commissioners, and that nothing but the strongest necessity would everhave reconciled him to its introduction. The Duke followed it upby sayingthat it shoaild be imposed no longer than was absolutely necessary.
The motion w&s agreed to unanimously. Mr. SnIMPSON, manufacturer, moved,-
" That the present system of levying the income and property taxes, by taxing Dermanent and precarious incomes alike, is mabife tly unand trading classe of tmhe gcounatOry. Ablndthuties meetingi ofe vopeinion that naotthing6 short o°f an entire cei-iion of the mode of assessment
Ie aiso spoke of the depreciation of machinery, and said that upon property of that description, amounting in value to 40,Csr0l, there would be an annual depreciation of 2001.- an amount of tax which any one would see must be depressingto any interest whatever.
Mr. HEYWooD, ALP., thought the reason of the injustice and inequality of the tax had been a matter of routine more than anything else. His own feeling on the subject was that the Government ought to take of the extra tax on the very first opportunity that they can do so with due regard to the honour of the country. He should be very glad if they could do it in April, hot the honour of Goveriment was plodged end they must stick to their principles; but he fully agreed with themetgonheiqatyf the tax, meeting on the inequality of
Mr. PAR-arit, M.P., concurred with the motion, bht would not pledge himself to any particular course of conduct.
Sir G. STRicKLAn-D supported the motion, which was agreed to unanimously.
The foUlowing propositions were also adopted by the meeting:-
" That this meeting condemns the practice of nUowing a p?rcentage to the collecting-offlcers upon the amount assesed or collected.'
That this meeting pledges itself to us every legitimate means to car ,v into effect the resolutionc just pass. and to support a petition to tn House of Commens embodying their substance: and thin meetintgl also requests our horough and counts mea rs of Parliament
The hon. gentlemen present gave the solicited promise, and the meeting separated.
WALSALL.
A meeting was held at WalsaU on Friday night to petition against the income-tax. The Mayor, Mr. Thomas, presided, and Mr. Forster, M.P. for the borough, was present. Aresolution in favour of abolishing the war 9d. having been moved and seconded,
Mr. FoRsTEit, ALP., addressed the meeting, and, alluding to the rumoured intention of the Government to take advantage of the delay in signing the ratification of peace, he said it would be well for the people to prepare for the worst, but he could not believe that the Goverament contemplated any such thing, as it would be o?posed to that manly and straightforward conduct which characterized the Premier. Though he (Mr. Forster) coald not ansv. er for the intentions of the Ministry, he could assure the meeting that an attempt at fraud-a violation of the spirit of the lawwould, if made, receive his meet etrenuocs opposition. (Cheers.) leconcurred in what had been said about the nequality of ehe tax as at present levied, and would be prepared to support any plan for its more equitable adjustment,
Other speakers folowed, and, the resolutions having been passed, a petition was adopted, which Mr. Forster was requested to present to the House of Commons.

The Great Blasting Operation At Holyhead Harbour.
THE GREAT BLASrrZLG OPERATION AT HOLYS
HEAD HARBOUR.
This grot national undertaking, which is being carriect out under the immediato direction of tho Board of Admiralty by the Megs. J. and C. Rigby, of Westmis4er
and which was designed by the late Mr. Rendel, afforde penodically to the civil and military cngineer an opportunity of witnessing the effect of large quantities of gun. powder brought to bear on the dislodgment of imen,,, masses of the hardest description of quartz rock, araounting
in several instances, toupwards of 10,000 tons. One of theseF stupendous operations took place on Friday, the 16th inSt in the presence of the Earl of Airlie; Lieutenant.
Colonel Servante, of the Royal Engineers; the Hon. W. 0. Stanley, XP.; Sir Richard Bulkeley, Bart.; Lor(t Clarenec Paget, Chancelor Trevor, Captain Bulkeleyl
Captain Skinner, 12N., Professor Ramsay, Mr. Hayter. besides several other engineers and scientific gentlemen, as. well as a very large party of ladies, and several hundre& spectator
The engineering arrangements were under the personaX. directionof Mr. (harlesRigby, assistod by Mr. Reitheimer, the resident engineer of the firm.
The aggregate charge in the four chambers, acting upon . face of 210 feet in length and U5 feet in beight,with a hne of least resistance of about 25 feet,vwas 16,0001b. of gunpowder. The voltaic battery was placed a short distance,
m the quarries, and the spectators were within a, protected battery or observatory in front of the moun. tain, at a distance of only 600 yards, from which they were enabled to witness the explosion without danger, nob a stone hawing been propelled 100 yards from the fce of ther quarry. We mLy here mention that nearly 6,000,000 tons. of sgne have been already dislodged by this means for the, constmction of the harbour, without failure and withouta accident. In the mininig operations which take placeolr this purpose the quantity of gunpowder used annualZ., ceeds 5w,OOOlb., or more than 250 tons, and the stone deposited in the sea for the formation of the rubble foundations and embankment exceeds yearly 1,000,000 tons. L. addition to the agency which gunpowder affords for the rapid construction of this breakwater, there are employed upwards of 1,200 men, a large number of locomotive.. engines, stationary engines, trAvelling cranes, with steam. power, and every modern appliance which mechanical skill. can bring to bear to accelerate the completion of this important harbour of refuge.
The northern, or great breakwater, is at present abouft 7,000 feet in length, or nearly one mile and --half, and will enclose an area of upwards of 800 acres of Holyhead-bay, rendering it, as far as it is already projected into the sea, a perfectly secure roadstead and harbour, available to the,lar&est veesls of any draught of water, in all winds, and iii. Al states of the tide. Its necessity and tlity have become, so obvious that it doubtless will, for the benefit of! sbipping and the public service, be made complete bv considerably extending the arm of the breakwater whicli forrs. the roadstead. So much has the importance of this harbour been felt by mariners that in its present state it has afforde& protection to more than 300 vessels at one time during the. heavy gales in this channel, and must thereby have saved a vast number of shipwrecks and human lives.
To show its increasing utility it may be mentioned that
in 184, 1,788 vessels, with a tonnage of 137,169 tons:, anchoredunder shelter of the northern breakwater, andt this number has been increased to upwards of 3,000 vessels. during the last year.
The system adopted of constructing this breakwater so as to combine the advantages of obtaining stone from the adEining mountain with economy and rapidity of execution.
as en that of forming timber stages, with railways over the line of the breakwater, about 80 feet above the bottom of tho sea, and depositing the masses of stoneof al dimensions, by droppmg them verticaUly from. iron railway waggons, in trains of from 10 to 12 at a time, into the required positions, thus bringing up the miss simultaneously to above the level of the sea. In this. manner as much as 25,000 to 30,000 tons have been deposited in one week, and this vast demand is supplied by the, great blasting operations that take place in the quarries from time to time, and of which the one we have de, scribed as witnessed on Friday last, the 16th inst. producing upwards of 100,000 tons at one explosion
affords the supply. Although the severe storms which. have repeatedly occurred on this exposed coast have done from time to time much injury to portions of the stages, not a stone has beendisplaced from the superstructure now im. counrse of construction upon the rubble embankment, thut. showing thejudgmentand skill evinced bythe late Mr. Rendet in the adoption of this system of engineering as applied tothe rapid and successful formation of tarbours of refuge. Theeastern breakwater (forming the inner area) and packet. pier wiU bo shortly commenced, with which the Chester and klolyheadRsilway will be connected, so tbat passengers camn without delay embark under cover on board the packets from the Harbour Railway Station, avoiding therebyany interruption to the traffic in the transfer from tha pckets to the trains, and saving thereby nearly an hour. This pier wil also admit of being used as a store for at least 2,000 tons of coals for the use of the packets or other vessels that may avail themselves of the harbour.
The works were commenced in 1848, under the authority' of Her Majesty's Government, by Messrs. J. and C. Rigby,, of Westminster, London, and have since that time been unceasingly carried forward by tbem. When completed, this. harbour will stand unrivaUled as one of the most stupendous achievements of the present age, and wil form ono of: the finest and largest artificial harbours in the world. It would also, in the event of war, afford for the trade, commerce, and shipping of Liverpool one of the surest means oe protection, being capable of harbouring in safety vessels of war of the largest class, and in any numbers which might be found necessary for the purpose.

DEPUTATION TO SIR GEORGE GREY.-On Sattrr day a deputation compoeed of the rector, churchwardens* and vestrymen of the parish of St. James, Westminster, had an interview with Sir George Grey, in order to call him attention to the increasing number of houses of iUfame and! betting-offices in thatpart of London. Amemorialwasread by Mr. Buzzard, the vestry clerk, which stated that. houses kept for prostitution had become alarmingly numerous m the parish, and that they were not only' highly injurious to public morals but seriously detrimental to the value of property. The memorial then referred to the existence of betting-houses and to thn obstruction on the highwaysoccasioned by the persons; frequenting theso houses, and concluded by requesting thats some lawshould be framed to remedy both the grievances complained of. Sir G. Grey said that he would refer the first complaint to the Attorney-General. As to the betting.
houses, the complaint was rather azainst the administratiom~ of the law than the law itself. SirRichard Mayne enteredC into an explanation of the difficulties experienced by tho poHce m obtaining convictions against the pro. prietors of betting-houses. A conversation arose as to the powers of the police in regard to obstructions in. the streets. Mr. Geesin said he had been informed that-
licemen were in the habit of frequenting gaioibling,hous
ir Richhrd Malne samid he winot received a sin1Gecoin plaint on the subject. Sir George gr fer ryng ti
several statements made by membrs Of the deputation, in. timrated that the memorial should have his consideration, and that he wonld communicate with the hattorneywGenera in reference to the meat effective steps for carrying the existing law bearing on the subjects brought under his notioep into operation.

It appeared that Mr George Harris, treasurer of the psoard of guardians of the Kidderminster Union, had taken out an adminiatrative, summons, cefling on Mr. Bradford Turner, eldest son of the, late Mr. Abraham Tuner, to show cause why the estat'
should not be wound up by the Court of Chancery. Its. alyo appeared that pr. Farley, uncle of Mr. B. Turner, was about to do the same thing. Beyond this there was noet mnuch information before the meetin It was 0aaoed thati. the liabilities would not exceed 45,0004mind that tLgst would prove nearly 33,000k, being very nearly, the sus*'nentionedinTkcTrmcslast week. There wasconsiderablediWore of feeling among the creditors, and a portion of them waiext to investigat the affairs of the bank as far as possible~ and to report upoi
the best means for bringing matters to an immediate close,~
At length a resolution was moved by Mfr. Bird and seeonde(t by Mr. Chiling-worth for adjourning the meeting for a fort... night. Upon thIis M1r. Boycott moved, as an amendmnentthat a committee of creditors be appointed to examine int%
