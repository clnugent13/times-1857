Clipper saimng vessels which succe dedthem, relying wholl on their sails, have met with but little better ElCcess; for, althoug sometimes able to perform most rapia and satisfactory t on other occasions, have had them extended to 80 dars and UpaDs by calm and contrary winds- The present Company seeing that neither the fuIl-power steamer nor clipper cailing ship wams able to per.orm the voyagewith regularity have arrived at combining the best qualities of the latter with these of thel former, and thus take advntage of all thevarieties of Vwindaidweather nseparable from so long a voyage without tlre neesity of calling anywvhere for coals.- Pursuing this obJect, they have ompleted the steam clipper Royal Charter, which has just sailed for Australia with every prospect of making a rapid and suceasfol voyage. The demand of te Post-office for tenders for the conveyanoe of the mails by steam power now induces the Directors for the first time to come before the public and invite their immediate co-operation thus enabling them to extend their fleet so far as to add to the ordinary profits of the voyage the remuneration awarded for the mail service. The Company consider that, being already engaged in the trade, an hbaving perfected the arrangements both in England and Autralia. such as will seem-s the practical care and economy of private manage ment, they can offer decided advantages overall other competitors and do, therefore, confidently appeal, not only to the capitalist seeking a safe and profitable investment, but to alt interested in the future prosperity of our Australian colomies.

IRELAIN,? (to! OUR Mem - DUIBit, SATURDAY tIORNING. TnE s"DL1R FAUDS. TTp to the present nothing reliable has been per'mitted to transpire with respect to the private exa-niination of Mr. James Sadleir before the Master in Chancery. Gossiping rumours there are in abundance, one of which is to the effect that the fair fame of certain parties in England having had dealings with John Sadleir has been considerably tarnished by the disclosures of MIr. James Sadleir. Of colrse, this may be taken for jtust what it is worth, There is some natural discontent that the examination of so important a witness as the manager of the bank should have been takenwith closed doors, but the more general opinion is that at tlis stage of the inquiry the Master exercised a sound discretion in withholding the information thus elicited, at least for the present. It is not in the nature of things that the secret can be long kept wholly inviolable. A Dublin letter in the Belfast Mercury says that forgeries, in the shape of promissory notes, to the amount of 25,0001., have been- committed by. John Sadleir on lMr. William Dargan. This, too, although not improbable, maybhe'but one of the flying "shaves" of the hour. Another provincial iournal, well versed in the affairsof the Tipperary Banik and its numerous branches, calls attention to a system of speculation in the deposit receipts of the bank - "We have been told (says the LeinsterExpress) of several instances where they have been purchased for 6s. in the pound, and lOs. refused by country speculators, for th'ose securities. There is every reason to expect that the full anount will be mltimately paid to the depositors, as, in addition to the list of shareholders, there are several persons of wealth who separated themselves ' withlin the last three years,' and can be made amenable. No doubt, there are many struggling persons, left utterly unable to meet their engagements, who may be obliged to submit to the sale of their deposit receipts for ' whatever they wil bring;' and for this reason, if a composition such as has been named could be effected speedily, a considerable sacrifice might be judiious. It bas been urged that the Bank; of Ireland might aid the depositors, by making advances on their securities of even IOs. in the pound; and, considering the position it occupied in reference to the Tipperary Bank, a little liberality of this kind on the part of tile directors might be Teasonably ex-pected, and would serve to allay the strong feeling which naturally exists in the minds of those who have been misled by the connexion of the Bank of Ireland vwith the Tipperary Bank; for it is certain that without that connexion the bankrupt concern could never have obtained the confidence it possessed, nor,in fact, held its ground for one-half the time to in flict such serious injury wherever its ramifications extended&" The subjoined information with respect to the prospects of the shareholders and depositors is supplied by the DuUlinsEvezing Post.- "The affairs of the Ti perary Bank still continue to engross a large share of pubtli anxiety, -which, however, has been partiaUy allayed by the appointment of the official manager. The question as to the liabilities of members has been one Nvhich has exrerienced a very considerable amount of discussion, but upon which no two persons that we have mnet with were found to agree. From the remarks of a friend upon whose discretion and judgment we have the fullest reliance we have gathered the following outline of | explanation, which we believe will be found to throw as much liglht upon the subject as can well be brought to bear upon it wtithout the assistance of aphalanx of lawyers. In the first place, it is quite certain that where there has been a oon&fjide transfer the transferor is freed from all liability after hree years. as to the contributories, when the Master shall make out his list of contributories, he will include in it all who are liable to be called on, whether aetual members or former members. The list will not be confined to the names that appeared in the successive Tzhblin Gazetes, but will com prise all persons n-ho have been members at any time within three years. By makinout such list the Master will only declare the liability of a paity. He will not find the order in which the different parties are liable. That has not, so far as we can learn, been judicially decided. The question arises upon the 18th section of the 6th of George IV., c. 42, the act relating to Joint-Stock Banks in Ireland. The analogous English enactment is the 13tlf section of the 7th George LV., cap. 46. Undoubtedly, allpresent membersare prinmarily liable for nl existing engagements: but as to former members, Mr. Farrer, in his book on ContrTbzdorkies, says, first, that 'the former member (vwho has not ceased to be such for three years) is liable only to such contracts as fall within he classes mentioned in th'e 13th section of the 7th George IV., ca 46;' and, secondly, that 'the former shareholder cannot be required to contribute at all until the whole class of existing shareholdershasbeen found unable to xise sufficient assets to meet the debts; and, possibly, that before contribution is required of persons falling within the second aud third subdivisionsof the clas offormer membersa similar inability should appear on the part of the preceding subdivision.' See lMr. Farrer's book, page 100. According to the act and to this reading of it, former shareholders are liable only on contracts entered into w~hile they were shareholders; and even on such contracts the present shareholders must be exhausted before the former ones can be touched; and as among the former shareholders those on the list of 1853 are not liable until those on the list of 1854 have been exhausted, and so on. In a case which came before Vice-Chancellor Xindersley his Honour threw out an intimation that the liabilities of the contributories should be regulated by the 13th section of the 7th George IV. ; but, as we statedabove,-there has been noformal judicidal decision upon the question." THE MIDEX EXPURGATORIUS Ur IRELAND. The following remarkable statement appears in the AraTtioss of this day. What will moderateRoman Catholics now think of the Pope's.choice of a successor to the late Archbishop Murray in the diocess of Dublin? Nevertheless, the arbitrary stretch of authority here chronicled may not be unproductive of future good, for it is scarcely within the bounds of probability that in the 19th century suchn fantastic tricks can be endured wYithout some show of repugnance " This weekthe Nation has been expelled, by spiritual authority, from the reading-room of the Catholic Young Mfen's Society of this city. The equally heterodox Taldae has also been summarily ejected. Ii2-abile d7tet, the Tdelcg,-al7 has been also condemned to expurgatorial pains; and the only periodical reading which the'rev. guardian of the society, acting under his Grace the Archbishop's directions, approves for the perusal of the Catholics of Dublin is to be found in the imprinted pages of T/ic Times, Punch, Saundles's Xousietter, and the Evening Post. Such are the organs of public opinion retained, while the Tablet and the Nation are expelled. We do not mean to oniit invidiously the fact that te obsequious and orthodox pages of the Prccman?s Journal have also escaped censure,; but, while wve say so, need we pause to observe upon the startling and scandalous circumstances thus revealed in its plenitude, that every | organ of Catholic opinion in this city edited by a Catholic editor has been publicly subjected to a wholesaie censure ? On Wednesday evening last, after the usual business of the society had been discharged, the Rev. Mr. Mlulligan, guardian of the society by his Grace's appointment, stated that he was obliged wvith regret to direct the attention of the members to articles appearing in two of the papers taken into their reading-rooms, which inculcated resistance to spiritual authority. He theen road the speech of Archdeacon Fitzgerald I from the Alation, and the letter of a 'Priest of Ossory,'from the Tablet. He stated it was his duty to direct the removal I of these papers from the reading-rooms. A considerable number of the members took objections to this course, so surmary, and attempted to move an amendment; but were prohibitedbythechainman, Mr.M. Fitzpatrickt, onthe ground thatthe spiritual goardian had absolute poweriunthe matter; that notice should be given of any amnenchnent-an imnpossibility under the circumstances; to showf their impartiality, however, the committee had agreed to expel the 2clegropl." REisINISCE2fCES OF AX' EX1LE. The public have not heard the last of Mfr. Edmond O'Flaherty, or of his numerotts eccentricities while in the employ of the Government as a commissioner of income-tun. In thte course of the usually dull tproceedings of a half-yearly ratilway meetingr (thle M jidland Great WVestern) the followiing inforntation was elicited wvith respect to one of his monetary Itransactionls: I" Lord Castlernaine said he did not under-stand anb item iof the account relative to ' forged transfers.' " sThe Chairman, in reply, said that 15 shares wrere disposed of under a forged poiverof attorney -by a-gentlenma.n jwho bad left the country. That transfer hiid all the appearIance of being g,enuine, so much so that he understood that a te gentlemian wvhose ntame appeared as that of the witness !was not at all satisfied that he himiself had not 'written it.

THE CATHOLIC iSIVansiTy. The total subscriptions towvards the funds of the University 'in St. Stephen's-green, collected since the month of January, amount to 1,7101. A churcha in connexion with the College is about to be erected on a scale of magnificeiie never before attempted in this country. In accordance with Dr. Newman's wislh, the building is to be in a style of architecture almost unlmown at this side of the Alps--an Italian basilica. The walls are to be encrusted wvith Irish marbles of various hues, and wvith mosaic paintings, above which large subjects in encaustic are already being prepared from the worlks of the early masters in the studios of Rome.

The outrage, brtal as it was, can scarcely come under the class of murder, being rather a case of aggravated manslaughter, arising out of the drunken orgies withwhich too many of the lower orders delight to honour the natal day of the patron saint:- " Another fell and foul murder has been committed in Tiis doomed locality, almost on the very spot where the imfortunate Mr. Gallaher was shot in May, 1845, and, I may state, not far from the police barrack. I give you some particulars:-We had on Monday (St. Patrick's Day) a fair, which was attended by a vast crowd of idle young fellows, who towards evening began to beat and batter every person in any way obnoxious to them. A decent, quiet, mnoffensive man, named John Gallaher, who lives near the town, was going home about 9 p.m., quite sober, and, having crossed the bridge, he found a party of thoseraffians beatinga boy named Cassidy. He begged of them to desist, when they turned on him, and, with short sticks loaded with lead, battered his skull in. He continued to live, suffering intensely, until last night. The boy Cassidy is not expected to live many hours. Some fellows, sup. posed to be the murderers, have been arrested by the police. I have Just heard an good authority that twvoparties of these ruffians were an fon day for above an hour mn two houses, whose names I haveheard also, rnning lead to the end of zhort sticks that they could carry lunder their coats."
STATE OF TBADE. ]dNCHESTEIt, ILuMcA 22. The advices from India have given some encouragement to the demand, but buyers hold back a little and are disposed to be cautious in the nurchase of cloths suited to that marlket, in consequence of tke upward tendency of prices. The latest advices from the United States have acted upon [the Liverpool cotton-market so as to depress prices about id. per lb., and buyers of manufactured goods naturally ant icipate a corresponding reduction; but manufacturers are able to support prices for shirting6 and some other India fabrics in conseguence of being well employed for the present on unfinished orders given out some time ago. They are the more anxious to supporttheir present position, also, because of the unremunerative state of the prices of mannfactures generally. In 36-inch shirtings and printers there is also a fair demand, at fullprices. Domestics, longeloths, and T-cloths suited to other markets are nominally unaltered, but there is a slow demand, and in some kinds of these goods the buyer is practically in a better position. In yarns the market is rather weaker even than on Tuesdav, and priesfor bundle yarns are about id. lowver generally In double yarns above 60's (for Yorkshire and Russia), and in singles, such as are used for India shirtings, prices are fully supported, the demand being good and the supply not very plentifuL The home trade establishments continue to be well supplied with country orders for the spring trade. BIRMlIN11SGH. 3L XC 22. Thepreliminary meeting of iromnasters, which is appointed to be held on Thursday next, is looked forward to with some degree of anxiety. It cannot be doubted that in consequence of many causes to 'which reference has on frequent occasions recently been made the trade at the present moment is in a doubtful position, and that the question of prices will at the ensuing meeting give rise to considerable discussion. Among the leading firms of the district a reduction is deprecated; but on the other. hand, the limited demand which at present exists, the misunderstanding which has occurred between this country and America, and the nnderselling now practised by a considerable number of inferior makers, induce many influential members' of the trade to think that a fall may be deemed expedient. There have been, however, during the present week indications of an am rovement in the demand for merchant iron, and this, too, in spite of an anticipated reduction of prices. Orders to some amount have been received at exising rates, and others it is said are held back until the decisionof Thursday shall be made known. The probability ir, so far as we can lea, that the first firms will, at the preliminary meeting, propose to maintain last quarter's prices, but that, as usual, makers, who are never bound by the determination of what is termed " the trade," will do the best they can for themselves, and accept anv price which may be forced upon them by their necessities. It mnst be recollected, however, that, whatever may be the determination of the masters on Thursday, their pioceedings will still be subject to the quarterly meetings held at Wolverhampton, Birmingham, and Dudley a fortnight afterwards; and duringthatperiod events may, and, in all probability will occur, which may materially change the prospects of the iron trade doring the ensuing quarter. Should peace be happily consummated and affairs in North America assume a more pacific charracter, there is no question that iron will be firm, with a tendenev, if anything, to an advance, rather than to a reduction. - There has been no alteration worth'y of special notice in the coal trade of the district during the present week. Notwithstanding the new supplies brought from the immiediate neighbourhood, large quantities of coal continue to be imported into South &taffordshire from the north, and thus to some extent fill the vacuum created by the conveyance of Staffordshire coal to London and other southern localities. The flling off in the winter demand has, however, caused a general reduction of rates, and the proprietors of pits in one or two neighbourhoods are now establishing dep6ts in districts where they can supply coals in retail, without the intervention of dealers. A general opinion prevails that the high price of coals used for domestic purposes, even at a ditance from the pits, is to be attributed, not to the coal Proprietors, but to the coal merchants and dealers who sell them to the public; and, if the difference betweentbezateshithertochaMedbythe dealersandthosenow advertised by the mineovwners is to be admitted as evidenc2, thereis considerable truth in the accusation. Staffordshire coal can nowY be had in Slocester, and other parts at as great a distance, as cheap, if not cheaper, than in Birmingham, and in London tfe charges are almost equally low. The ready means of conveyance afforded by the London and North-Western and Oxford, Worcester, and Wolverhampton railways have thus cheapened coals in the metropolis, while Birmingham gains little. The orders received by our merchants during the present week have not been commensurate with the expectation of many of our best and least speculative traders. The spring trade with the United States has not justified the sanguine anticipations of winter. The advices received by the last packets represent that stoclks of hardwae are low, and, as remittances prove, cash more abundant, but that in the present political relations of the two countries there is little disposition evinced to give coinmissions to Liverpool houses, through which the chief business wdth Birmingham and the iron districts is transacted. In this town the American houses which have establishments in New York and Bostonrepresent the hardware trade with the United States as languid, andlikely to continue so until a more pacific understanding existsbetween thetwo countries. Commercial travellers now coming off journeys do not give a very favourable representation of the present state of the ironmongery trade. Orders are far from abundant, but notwithstanding, although business is not active, accounts are generally well collected, and retail tradesmen throughout the country are reluctant tooverstock.themaselves with goods. As amatter of consequence, the manufacturers of Birmingham hesitate to make for stock, and the men inmany of ourprincipal hardware establishments are only partially at work. When a good demand again sets inand it is confidently anticipated to'occur during the summer -both retail tradesmen and manufacturers will be found equally short of stock, and more Labour in demand. There has been no material change in the condition of the various branches of the copper trade during the past week. The price of all descriptions of material and manufactured goods continues to be fimnly maintained, and, apparently, thereis noimmediateprospectofareduction Some idea of the present high rates charged for copper may be formed from the fact that there are parties in the trade living who have bought certain qualities at 407. and 50Z. per ton, which are now fetching in the maTket 1261. per ton. One well knolwn establishment will cease to exist among the copper manufactures of Birmingham during the ensuing week. In consequence of the deaths of Mlessrs. George and Thomas Attwood, the late proprietors, it Las been resolved to close the Baskervmle Copperworks, and it is understood that one, if not niore, of the valuable patents there produced will be transferred to other establishments in the town. The seamless tube, which of late years has been so extensively used in the manufacture of marine and other engines, and which is capable of expansion from 8-16ths to 6 inches, has been let to Mr. Wilkes, of the Bordesley works, and is now in great demand. The copper slenders, for the manufacture of which the Baskerville Works obtained a considerable reputation, will also be carried on by other arties. The introdulction of new machinery in the manuracture of brass cocks has led to unpleasantness in some parts of the district, and at Wolverhampton it has caused a temporary strike of the workmen employed in oue or more establishments. As yet the turn out has not extended to this town, although this branch of business is carried on to a greater extent in Birmingham than any other town in the kidngdom. At the present time the brass candlestick mangfacture is more than usually inactive. Of late years, owing to the general use of gas, this branch of brass founrcry has bsen greatly depressed, but this spring the demand for the home, as well as for the foreign trade, has been more than ever limited. Fortunately, the manufacture of gas fittings has more than supplied the deficiency of labour created bv the falling off in the candlestick manufacture; but still there are numibers of workmen brought up to the latter business who suffer severely at certain periods, but more especially after the turn of Christmas, from want of employment. 'he general glass manufacture of Birminghani and the district continues to be much depressed; in more than one - establishment business is almost entirely snSpended; but in the midst of the general slackness of this branch of trade a foreign order for the East promises to give an impetus to ornamental wvork. It consists of lustres and chandeliers upon a most gorgeous and gigantic scale, and its execution is intrusted to a well-knowvn establishment the productions of which were among the chief attractions in the Crystal Palace of 1851. In plate, window, and coummon table g1ass there is comparatively little doing, and the same dbservation waill pply to the principal establishments in Worcestershire. WNVork in one or two of our glasshouses is almost entirely suspended. Eowever confident may be the hopes entertained of a speedy peace, there is in Birningham no snspension of the m0oSt vigorous preparations for a renewal of war. The Board of Ordnance exhibit the greatestzealinobtainiingthelirompt execution of their contracts with the gunmnakers, and, what is more, they have recently adopted means by which to render more certain the effleicncy of the arms manufaotured. Bxperienced men have been sen' fromr London, whose dut>y t is, after the rifled musk-ets are proved, to try-their precision in the field. Ground has been obtaine;l for this purpose within a short distanuce of Birmingham. and 2S0 per cent. or the guns produced are daily suhnitted to this ordeal. We believe we may stato with perfect trath that up to this time the trials wvhich have taken place hiave given the greatest satisfaction. There is now no alpprehension that. thc close of the Russian war or the opening of the Government establishment at Enfleld wll for rome time to come injuriou-s1y .1I affect the gun matiufacture of Birmingham.

NOT TlGRAId, } This week having been broken by the Easter ho only a moderate number of buyers have visited us, bu, the hosiers and lace manufacturers are busy in most c men's. In the lace branches the chiefambunt of trade is for the home supply, a larger demand being stimule the prospect of peace; and a considerable quantity oi is being exported, many of them to the Iunited several of the American buyers, who were here in 0 and No7ember, having returned earlier than us! sort up for the sping, previous. to commF operations for the fall trade. Altogether there i_J confidence, and the result is that the rising vat material at present has no tendency to check de though many fear that it will do so shortly. little discuEssion has been going on lately, occasioned importation of lace machinery into France from this bourhood. At the opening of the Universal Exhibit' Paris, intimations were conveyed to manufacturer' tbat, if they 'would contribute freely and in confidenc' of the best of their productions--which are exclude? France bythe extiing tariff-the result -would be a co: able relaxation, and the opening of a door to internm commerce. Acting upon these considerations, a gocwas shown both of lace and hosiery. The however, is not a relaxaticn of the tariff. b! effort on the part of the Erench manufas to import such machinery as we excel in, so that tin supply themselves. We do not object to this; on th trary, we loolk upon it as a little advantage, nasmi goods not now known in France will i a whle general use there, and a custom estblished in Eranc extend itself to the United States.

The commercial accounts from Australia by the lightning are a fortnight later than those previously xeceived, and are favourable not only as regards the gold production, but also as to the harsvests in all the colonies. lour, which a month or two back had been at 501. per ton, was now at 301., and li-elytogolower. Mereantile confidence -was steadily reviving, and the approach of 1856 was welcomed with the belief that it would prove a year of great prosperity. The explanationof the Lightning having brought only 4',000l. of gold consists in her having been rurveyedaftersustainingatemporary damage. Shippers were thus induced to prefer the Blackwail, which accordingly sailed the same day with 350,0001. During the next fortnight the gold arrivals from Australia can hardly fail to be large, and, in the preeent state of the exchanges, a considerable prolortion may be expected to remain in this country. The railway meetings during the week have principally been connected with secondary undertakings. The progress of the Bffridport line is stated to be' satisfactory, and the directors congratulate the shareholders on the pnnctuality with which the payments on the severals calls have been made. The report of the Scottish Central Company has been adopted, including the declaration of a dividend at the rate of 5 tIer cent. per annum on the consolidated stock. The traffic on the Midland Great Western continuestobe steadily developed, and the available balance is 40,5s771. After the payment of all preference charges and the declaration of a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent., a surplus of 4,0001. will be carried to the next account. According to the report of the Selkirk and Galashiels Company, this line will shortly be opened for traffic. A -working agreement with the North British Railway is to be submitted for the considerationof the share. lo?ders on a future occasion. At the Chester and Ilolyhead meeting the points discussed were the completion of-the agreement with the London and Nortlh-WVestern Company, the continuance of the :scrvices of the Committee of Consultation, and- the general prospects of the undertaking. The report cf the Newcastle and Carlisle Company states that, after providing for the payment of a dividend of 5 Ser cent. per annuni, the directors wil lbe enabled to tarry 4,8951. to the reserve fund. The shareholders of the NorthtBritish Railway have adopted the reTort, and agreed to the declaration of the preference dividends; but a scrutiny has been -demanded on the question in relation to -the bill for adjusting the capital account. The directors of the Caledonian Company recommaend a dividend at the rate of 2 per cent. per annum, leaving-a small balance to be carried forward>'he traffic generally has suffered from local circura- stances, while the position of the money-market has increased the interest charges on borrowed capital.

AIhWA Y INTZLLIGENCE. ChA . T.P.MAN The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Thursdayat Glasgowv, Mr. W. Johnston in the chair. The report, an abstract of which has appeared in The Times, was tal;en as read.. The CnAIxaLr, in moving the adoption of there port, said that the directors were very sorry to have such a poor state of accounts to submit. The income of the preceding halfyear was 1,0001. morethan the past half-year, and, as they had received more, it was natural to expect a higher dividend; but the reason for not doingso wasan increase inthe workdng expenses from 431. 7s. per cent. to 471. 6s. per cent., or about 4 per cent, additionaL Now, to pay 1 per cent. of dividend would require. about 15,0001. They had paid 3 per cent. in the former half-year, and only proposed to pay 2 per cent. for the past half-year, as there was a falling off, at least, of 15,0001. in the income for the past half-year. The whole income was about 300,0001., in round numbers, and 4 per cent. of increase on the working expenses was an in-crease of 12,0001. on the half-year. The directors had done what they could to keep down the expenses, but the competition intowhich they were driven, and other causes, prevented them saviDg what they could have wished. They hakd put on extra trains to London for passengers, with a view to show what they could do. They were thus enabled to make better terms with the English lines, and since January last had made a saving in the working expenses in that direction. They had found it necessary to continue the competition with the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, and, of course, their working expenses were further increased in that way, but that comvetition was now at an end. The sum of 15,0001. waseasily accounted for in additional expen. diture; the increase of interest alone during the half-year amounted to Z74611., notwithstandiog that.the credit of the company was good. A considerable aving vwould be effected boy the increase of plant on the line, which now gave them sutficient for all ordinary purposes. The working expcenses w.ould- also bo reduced in consequence of a contract for the maintenance of the least expensive part of their line at 1701. per mile having terminated on the 1st of January last. By the termnination of 'that contract some thoua-ndsper annum would be saved to the company. The English and Scotlb working agreement would give them better rates, and diminish the working expenses; it had worked very fairly for them from theist of January last. They had arranged with their,East Coast neighbours to start no more trains to places to which they go than their traffic required, and they had agreed to do the same in regard to them. They would thus have better rates, but not extravagant rates. An agreement had been entered into with the Bdinburh and Glasgow Company fora portion of the traffic, and the proportion between certain points would be fixed by Mr. Houldsworth, and the arrangement would be carried out as soon as possible. He believed it would turn out to be a fair agreement, and that it would meet the approval of the shareholders. The new agreement was for the term of ten years, and had this recommendation, that at the end of two-and-a-half years either party vwas at liberty to go back to the arbiter and ask for arevision. He believed that it was a fair agreement to both parties, and that an unfair agreement would not stand. The promoters of the Denny Junction Railway had asked them to suberibe 30,0001. towards that undertaklig, arf& t46 promoters would raise 65,0001. themselves. lhey also propoied to give the Caledonian Company 50 per cent, of the r'eceipts to work it when completed, and further for their 30,0001. they were to get six-nineteenths of the traffic on the line, even if it exceeded the coat of 95,0001. The Caledonian would. be exempt from all expenses if the -bil were defeated in-Parliament. The proposed line would run parallel with the Scottish Central, but an some places it would be four miles distant from it, and would pass through the very centre of the district tobe accommodated If the Scottish Central Company had not done anything antogonistic to tnem, they might perhaps have consultedthem onthe subject, buttheyhad become their enemies. soon as the agreement between the Caledonian and Edinbourghand Glasgow wvas abolished the Scottish Central entered into an agreement with that company for what was I called mutual protection, or, in other words, that the Scottish Central should send all the traflic they could past the Caledonian and on to the Edinburgh and Glasgow line, and rice rerai. The Scottish Central also entered into the Stirling agreement, whereby whatever came from the north upon their line became their traffic, to be disposed of as they thought fit. Shortly afterwards the Edinburgh anadGlasgow and Scottish Contral companies~ entered into arrnzahe meets with the East Coast lines to send all the traffic pist aCaledonian. TheScottsh Centri -Company had a xnted Mr. L.atbam, the manager of the Edinburgh and Giscow Company, to be their manager, and since then thev had iad nothmz but annoyance from that quarter. e hoped, however, that the operation of the agreement would make them better friends, and that peace would enable them to increase their receipts and diminish their expenses. Mr. SmsVEsoN moved an amendment to the effect that all systematic Sabbath labour be discontinued. Mr. CoLQuHouw seconded the motion. Mr. CA1PBELL said that every one must be gratified that the company were to have ;eace at last, ancd they must all feel thanklful to Mr. Eadfield and his frends for bringing about such a result. He considered that the agreement with the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway Company was one of the most important transactions ever entered. into b the company. He trusted that it would be submittdto a special-meeting of the shareholders-for their approvaL- It was right they should have a formal opportunity to express their opinions on it. He believed its terms were fair and equitable, and would meet with the hearty and unanimoussupport of the company. The report exhibited a decrease in revenue and an increase in working expenses The increase,on the worldng expenses was the most unsatisfatory part of the report. The only consolation was that the Ai;dinburgh and Glas5gow were nearly as bad- as le Caedonian, and stood quite as much in need of reform. Taklng the threo corresponding half-years, the worling expenses had ri'ren step by step, first from 5,4191. to 7,25Lt., then to 8,5191., and next to 10,0001., having doubled itself in the course.-of Three -years or risen from 10,8381. "-year to, 20,i32E. a-year. The main cauwe of thesensaisf1ry re!suits ws the fact that the directors kept themselves too much alrioE from the details of the company'h bainea.; 1 Mr. Gxr.Low then proposed a resolution to the effect that a committee of gentlemena be appointed TO examine into the present position and management of thb company, and to re. port at. an adjourned meeting as to tle beet means of seingits permanent prosperity, and that it be a special t dutyothiscommittee to examine and consider what chauges it would be ptudent and desirable to make- in the system of managementS the mode of appointing dirtors, teduties required of' them, and the aamount of tock they thould be reqluired to eld; and 'further, to suggest Some node by which the proprietors would have more control over the actions of the board in regad to their property than they had hitherto been able to excercise. Yfc STP;V=NiON' amiendment for the di*cvnuliuluxwe of Sunday trains was put to the meeting and rejected by a large majority. Mr. GIrOWw's amendment wvas also rejected, ana the Chairman's motion ws carred by a large majornty. A vote of thanks having been given to the chairman, the meeting separated. HORNCASTLE AND KIRKSTEAD JUNCTION. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at Horncastle on Thursday;SirHenryDymoke, the chairman, presiding. The secretary read the report, which stated that at the last meeting ofthe company, held on the 17th of September, 1855, the directors had the gratification to annonnce the opening of the line for passengers and light goods; but it was not until the 26th of September that it was ready for heavy goods and general traftic, so that there had been but little more than t months of the working of the general traffic up to tho end of the half-year. The directors regard the result as very favourable, and fuly confirmnatory of the opinion they had expressed to the shareholders, that the line would not onlyprove agreat public convenience, hut would realize a fair dividend u the capital invested in it. The total earnings from thel Rth of August to. the 31st of December, 1855, were 1,5371. ; of vihich the proportion due to the Horneastle Company from thae Great lNorthern Railwray Company, including the termi- Nearly 7001. of the gross earnings have been received for passengers, and the directors anticipate that this branch of the trafevwill considerably increase during the succeeding half-year. With reference to the grain traffic, the harvest of last year was a very deficient one in this district, which materially diminished the delivery of corn. Taking all circumstances into consideration, the directors regard the amount of earnings as highly satisfactory. Already a spirit of improvemelnt has manifested itself at Horncastle in consequence of the facilities afforded by the railway, and it is beieved that, as the resources of the neighbourhood are developed, the market, fairs, and general trade of thattown will be greatly increased. The sum of 6611. is applicable for dividend, which the directors recommend should be 3g. ld. per share, beig equivalent to 4 per cent. per annum upon the share capital of the company (less income-tax), leaving a balance of 331. 16s. 7d. for the next account. On the motion of the CrrAmNs., tho report was unanimously adopted and the dividend declared. The proceedings, which wereof a verysatisfactoryrature, concluded with a voto of thanks to the chairman and directors for their attention to the interests of the company. MIDLAND GREAT WESTERN. The 21st half-yearly meeting of the shareholders of -the above company was held on Thursday at Dubln, ?,fr. John Ennis in thie chair. From the directors! report it appeared that the total income from the incorporated railway and canal was 75,0741., and the disbursements 45,2971., inaling the net profit for the half-year, 29,7771., which with 5,1651., the surplus from the last half-year, made a disposable sum of 34,9421 ; from which amount the directors proposed that a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum free of income-tax, amounting to 25,7641., be paid on the capital of the company, and 5,000l. be added to the depreciation fund, making that fund amount to 10,8621., and leaving the surplus of 4,1771. to the credit of the next half-year's account. The accounts of the extension from Athione to Galway hove been, as usual, examined by the Treasury auditor, and the directors state that the receipts on this portion of the line have so much improved that not only is there no necessity to make any claim on the baronies in reference to the interest payable on the Government loan within the last half-year, but that a small sum remains to their credit after providing for this contingency. There is a deficiency in the working of the Grand Canal, amounting to 5,8961., arising from the cost of repairing a serious breach on the navigation, and the consequent loss from the stoppage of the trade during the replacement of the canal bank The works on the Cavan branch are in a forward state, and the line will probably be opened for traffic about the end of May. The report was adopted nem. con., and after a brief discussion of no general interest the proceedings terminated. DURSIAY ANI) h[IDLAD JUNCTION. This short branch line, ranning from Dursley, Glocestershire, to the ?ildland (Bristol and Birmingham) line at the |Dursleyaud Berkeley station, is nearlycompleted, and vwill.be openedin May next. It is a narrow; gauge line, and is intended to bring the town of Dursley and valuable mills in that district intO the general railway communications o' the country. DUBLIN AND WICKLOW. It appears that this company and the Dublin and Kingstown Railway Company have arranged the differences that existed between them. The traffic on the Kingstown and Dalkey line has been stopped, in order that certain alterations and improvements in the removal of curves might be made, which had been suggested by the directors of the Dublin and Kingstown Company. The requisite alterations will be completed in June next. It is understood that the line from Dublin to Kingstown will be handed over to the Dublin and Wicklow Company on the 1st of September. The arrangements between the two companies are now considered very satisfactory. The Dublin and Kingstown proprietors are secured under the lease about 9 per cent. per annum upon the paid up capital of the company.

The weather has become balmny and spring-like, and accompanie by an inclination of wind t-o the westward, which has enabled several -irAiu and flour-laden vessels t0work up since Tuesday. Inactivity has marked the grain trade throughout this week. The questionable advaucemade in the price of wheat at Mark-lane yesterday week hag induced buyers to pause intheir operations, and we have a yery natural reaction. Prce have not declined to as low as they were two or three weeks hack, but a very unstlsfsItory fceing Prevails as to the future prospects of the trade. There ar a few Prominent causes whY this should be so-the restora tionl Of Peac, accompanied bY commercial difficulties of no ordnary maignitude, one Of the flnest Prospects for next harvest we probably everhad At A corresponding season Of the year. and the certainty that we hall reeiv liberal Supplies of foreign breadstuffs the next few months.

Although no definite information can be obtained of the progress of the rleaoe Conference the belief is growing general that the result will be favourable, and that in a few days miore only we shlufl hear of peace being established on a basin that wtllbe satisactory an d honaurable to this nation. Taothiscircumstance mainly isowing the depressed state of our corn-marketto-day. Immediately upon the Exchange openuing the factors offered their wheat at an advance Lon the nricew of she previous market, and, though there was on inclinationL among the mealmen to purchase, they were checked by the exorbitantterms demanded. The state of the flour-mark-et being duTll,sd pricea rulng proportionately lower than those of wheat together with the prospect of a further decline in the event of the establishment of peace, the millers stond aloof from trade, and there was a perfec: stag., nation.

LONDON, MONDAY, MABCH 24, 18W6. In the ever-chan,,ing pageant of the day, amid l Impenial births, Royal marriages, continental pacifications, threatenings of more distant war, and our little home game of faction, it is some reEef to come upon so calm a scene and so simple an event as the conf=ation of a youthful Princess. The narrative was made the most of by the ingenious gentleman to whom the British people at large are indebted for almost all they know of Royalty, but it is easy to see it was, as it ought to be, a very quiet affair. The Court -sat in their places, the fair catechumen, dressed in the proper amount of siLk; flounces, and lace, was introduced by her father, seated on: her first chair of state before the altar, whence, after a short service of prayer and praise, she Was led to the PBIMATE, at whose feet she received such blessing as consecrated lips can bestow. As to the ceremony itself, there is none so natural, none so incapable of theological definition. Not t-Ao divines agree what it is, yet there are but few Christians of any sort who will not respect what is, after all, only the Church's form of the patriarchal blessing. ,he PRsuscEss RoYAL has received many a lesson of piety, goodnes, humility, self-command, and graciousn6ss from her parents and her other advisers, and now is the time when ripening charater, unfolding powers, and strengthening will compel something like a decision whether or no she wil live by that law. In a very few years a thousanld kiJAMs, distractions, and temptations ' may effce6 from the.ind the imprint of early educa- tion, and oftentimes will the Royal girl revert to the simple rite in which she solemnly pledged herself to a life of Christian service. Sle will venerate that gentle imposition of hands which is shabred by every peasant child in this country, and which can neither be refined into mysticism nor vulgarized into fornality. From the time when ancient poets and sages pictiued the young liero retiring to some selitude, in order to choose between the persuasions of duty apd pleasure, everybody has recognized an age of decision. Young people, indeed, little know what a perfect identity of- character they retain from the carlicst youth to the latest stage of e.xistence, pncd how impossible it is to obtain another fresh start for the formation of. habits, if they lihave oince neglected their first opportunity at the natural setting of the character. * The leading incidents of a Royal career can lcarcely fail to awaken solemn recollections. *But the life of one Eiglish P.v*cessp confronts all forebodings, and dispels every sinister. augtmry from the past. From. the days 'when the Duchess of KETr was carefully and caiutiouisly introducing her daughter to the people she was one day to govern, that daught6r has enjoyed one even tenour of domestic happiness and public prosperity. Her content and moderation 'have obviated even that envy which usually haunts the fortunate and does its best to impair their happiness. The world ever looks for the coming mishap, the penalty of pride, the token of a comnudn humanity, that is some day to render the most aspiring and successful the objects of either pity or scorn. Queen VicroRiA has not yet given envy this triumph. She has not grasped at the shadow and lost the substance. She has ascertained her position as a constitutional Sovereign, -and she knows it to be beneficial, honourable, and' secure. Her personal influence is as great as that of any other European potentate. Such has been hitherto the career of the Princess with whomn it is natural to compare the youngr lady who on Thursday solemnly assumed her baptismal obligations, and knelt down to receive the PRurmATE'S blessing thereupon. Other European Princes are not so fortunate. It was but the other day we were told of a Sovereign following to the grave a faithful servant who had perished miserably at the very time that his nobles were reserving their condolences for his murderer. The private correspondence of the same Sovereign is a prey to the spies employed by rival factions to defeat the schemes of their rivals. We, on tnis more fortunate soil, can estimate the significance of such anomalies, and we know that tho country where they are found is one to try to the utmost the temper and genius of Princes. We know that such a country is but a sleeping volcano, 'which any accident may wak-en into activity. We know that in a very few years its Sovereign and its Royal family may have to decide at once, where decision is perilous and painful, and where nothing short of the highest character and the firme3t -principle wiU carry the Prince who wishes to do his duty through the storm. of opposition and obloquy he will certainly incur. But let uIs return home and sink from Courts to cottages. It is impossible not to contrast the solemnity of a Royal confirmation, simple as it was, with the ordinary administration of the rite in large and populous dioceses. The soul of the villager is of equal value with that of the Princess, and her case, as regards the occasion and the obligations of the ordinance, is virtually the same. But who does not know the imperfect preparation, the mere holyday look of things, the absence of oversight, the crowded church, the unchecked reign of the wilder spirits, and other disorders, that too often prevail where three or even four years' accumulation of children are brought from a disI tance to be confirmed? The confirmation of a Royal Princess involves a pomp and ceremonial, courtly and ecclesiastical, which is peculiar to the occasion. But there is no reason why every village chili #hould not be confirmed under circumstances as substantially impressive, and quite as auch adapted to awaken devotional ideas and fix religious resolutions on the mind. Let not village children be confirmed in the wholesale way in which they have been, by districts, carts and waggons conveying them to the central and most populous town of the neighbourhood. Everybody knows the unseemly accompaniments of large crowds, and the dangers which meet country lads in towns. Why should an occasion specially designed to be the commencement of a religious, course of life be converted into a scene of new ' temptations ? Of one thing we may be quite 6ertain,-that the young will attach importance to the rite of confirmation, and feel its sanctity, exactly in proportion as they see their elders and teachers doing the same. If they see that they are treated as if the occasion were an important and sacred one, that they are' jealously guarded from the approach of evil as they go and return, and that the ceremonial itself is solemn, they will draw the proper inference as regards themselves; but, if they see crowding and confusion around them, they will. argue that the rite is of no particular sanctity. Tliings have mended, we believe, in many dioceses as regards the management of confirmations; but there is still room for improvement.
By this day week the greater part of mankind are fondly trusting to hear the proclamation of peace. They are under, perhaps, the superficial belief that all Europe will rejoice at the healing of a woiund that once threatened to -ulcerate and infect every?member of the brotherhood of nations. Should any new obstacle start up, or ,should any cause be pressed as a reason against the immediate conclusion of peace, it will be at the cost- of that cause. It will incur no little risk of being regarded as an obstruetion and a nuisance,like the old woman who is sure to be in the way when people are in a hurry, and who will persist in stopping to adjust her own affairs, be they ever so trifling. It is, then, no real kindness, but simply a sort of officiousness, to urge on the Congress at Paris what are called the claims of Poland; and we are showing no want of historical interest in that people when we decline asking Lord CLAR_mDO'r to attempt what Lord CAsTLEREAGH attempted in vain more than forty years ago. In our position we cannot afford to be wasting what influence we - possess in devoting oLrselves to some one of the hundred impossible crusades that have been preached. in our time, or might be preached with as much reason as any other. Have not other races, and cities, and communities their -wrongs ? There are the wrongs of the Anglo-Saxons, who have by no n,ans survived the Nornu conquest, or become entirely mixed up with their proud conquerors. There are the previous wrongs of the British race, which is still cherishing an indignant nationality. in Wrales. There are the wrongs of Scotland and of Ireland, both of them very respectable and interesting nations, and by no means in so favourable a state for political agitation since their union writh this very dull country. There are the wrongs of ABD-n-KAD3m and his gallant tribes, that we might take the opportunity of pressing upoII the consideration of France; and even from the King of SARDUfIA we might ask the inldependence of the Genoese Republic. The correspondent who compels us to this reply himself adds Hungary and Italy to Poland, which is a very good beginning to start with when the series really is infinite. But why not go further backl ? There is the scattered house of Israel, which has preserved its nationality now for two thousand years. We might insist upon Turkey giving up Jerusalem to the Jews. But by the time we had got as far as that it is not certainthat some other race would not puit in its claim for the soil of Poland. Hungary, at least, would stand but a very poor chance in any reckoning that went back a thousand years. There hatebeenrights.recoveredin:Englaiid,anddocuments tendered in English law courts, and received as good evidence, that, if admitted on the Hungarian question, would- have sent every blessed member of the race, 'with his hands tied behind Iiis back, some- where into Central Asia. Once begin, where are we to end ? Is there no Statute of Limitations in national causes ? If any race finds itself illused, and believes itself strong enough to vindicate its independence or its equality, that is its own affair. But this is not the supposition on which the British puablic is appealed to. It is called on to help those who cannot help themselves. It is particularly hard on the British people to be constantly put under the imputation of being deaf to national appeals. There is hardly one of us here who does not represent in his own personal case some merged nationality or some persecuted cause. - The blood of Briton, Gael, and Celt,-of Huguenot and of other outcast peoples,-filows in the veins of most English families. Even in the reign of WuAus and MVIARY, DE FOE wrote a poem to show that the existing "Briton"! was a very mongrel personage, and six generations have since added to the medley. lWe are simply a crowd of people who find ourselves 9on these islands with no other rights or privileges but those we enjoy by the political constitution which binds our numerous races together. In the metropolis itself there are a hundred thousand Scotchmen of one religion, and twice that number of Irishmen of another, a3 content w ith such position as they can attain. by individual exertion. The - PoPE has more subjects in London than he has in his own city-generally mere hewers of wood and drawers of water to ,their more successful Protestant fellow-subjects. Our Universities are the resort of students from all parts of these isles, each of them renouncing his nationality, his province, and his country, and having no other privileges but those of our common rights. Take. any: chance company. This man bears the name of a distinguished Highland clan; that rian is descended from Irish Kings; another bears a name and arms that testify his ancestors were once noble in France; another is from an old border family; the rest hare lost sight of their origin, and are only members of the great struggling masi. Why are they to be summonedc to arms, to be denied the opportunity of an honourable peace, to be taxed deeper and deeper, and to be involved in endless quarrels with powerful empires, merely to give one more chance-a very small one indeedto people who are really quite as well off as we are ourselves, and whose only hardship is that they cannot do what we no longer wish to do for ourselves ? We have long ago given up all nationalities, all provincial privileges; everything whatever that stands in the way of imperial government and a perfect fusion of races. For ourselves, we are satisfied that is the best course, though it ha3 cost some sacrifices. Why, then, are we to be called on to do for others what we have long ago resolved not to do for ourselves? We cannot spare time and opportunity for the vain attempt to rectify history. That ground nmust be given up to the anualist, to the essayist, to the philosopher-in a *word, to the man of the pen. It is lost to the man of action. He has his own work to do, which presses hard enough, and leaves no room for antiquarian enterprises. We instanced t'ne lost sheep of the house of Israel as having somewhat parallel claims to our assistance. There would be no insuperable difficulty in collecting every Jew in Europe, and placing him in Palestine, to live, as well as he could, on the glorious recollections of the past; but it would be alinost impossible to collect the Poles, or ascertain Poland. We should first have to rescue every individual Pole and every half-Pole-for, like ourselves, they have undergone some intermixturefrom the powerful gripe of Russian, Austrian, and Prussian empire. These are no inconsiderable powers for us to challenge at a time when France would certainly not be for us, and very likely against us, and when we have a war of most serions dimensions looming upon us- in another part of the world. There is a honaely proverb in the north about extracting a pound of butter from the mouth of a dog, and which warns us of the certain cost and small result that would attend the experiment. That we should get well bitten in the attempt to make Russia, Austria, and Prussia surrender to us some 20,000,000 of their subjects expressly for the formation of a State that should keep them in perpetual alarm is so certain that it will not be denied. That the object of our officious interference would almost disappear in the struggle is, perhaps, equally certain. But will anybody define the enterprise laid on our conscience ? What are we to do? We wish to know exactly the people we are to take up, the geographical district in which we ;wre to locate them, and the Government unader whiuh they are to live. Then there comes tlfe great I question of means. We forbear to ask what part resuscitated Poland is to play in European politics. A versatile and ingenious race, with al' the splendid qualities that stimulate ambition, and every weakness that can give scope for its exercise, would of course take the usual advantage of a border State, -and play into the hands first |of, one neighbour, then "of - another, as suited the purposea of national aggrandizement or of personal ambition. Poland would not be Poland if it did: not resume this policy. But when we have seen any actual plan for the restoration of -Poland it will be time to criticize in detail. The objection at present is, that nobody has the couraga to propound such a plan, or to tell us what to do, except the preliminary step of a war with Russia, Austria, and Prussia. An equally chivalrous but more modest projector proposes a public subscription to soften and adorn M. KossuTu's exile. That, of course, is the affair of those who encouraged him in his unfortunate enterprise. For our part, we never gave any countenance to the man-whom-we -simply regarded as the DA-m O'Co of Hungary,-rather more of a gentleman in his language, but even more unscrupulous in his actions. Nobody could desire to see a man of great genius, and the chosen representative of a noble race, living in that poverty which falls to the lot of mere vulgar adventurers'. But it is not our affair. The British people have long ago agreed to act on totally -different principles from 'those -which. -M. K6ssurn seduced the Hungariaiis .to - follow, to their cost. That gentleman' may be a hero, and all but a martyr in his::way, and for a cause which we always thought hopeless - and -immoral ; - - but private life in this country abounds in heroes and m sartyr in, as we believe, much. better causes. All around us men of considerable talents,. and not without the' stiriTngs of a generous ambition, are suffering obscurity and want, and are leaving that inheritance to their children, because -they will not truckle to part, because they will not suppress their political or religious convictions, because they *ill not do homage to some petty tyrant - or to some local oligarchy. When we call men -Englishmen, that is the moral' significance we . attach to the word. Political writers have developed this stubborn quality of our nation, and popular poets have given it an imperishable grace. Even theologians have -given it a formal character, under the name of passive obedience. To our English mind it deserves more sympathy than M. Koassur's ambitiouis and chimerical enterprises. Why, then, is the - British .public to. be called on to- render, a tribii4e to"quialities -and t'o a car'eer which, in point of independence, are only those of 6rdinary Englishmen, and in other respects, on English grounds, are wholly indefensible 3
Those who have attended to our former observations with reference to the plan of deciding civil cases propounded by the Indian Law Commissioners will not fail to observe that tlhe principal difficulty with which the Commissioners had to contend was the adaptation of the same xystem of procedure to small and large cases, so as to contrive at once that, without any material variation, the largest as wel as the smallest cases elhould be brought under the same rule. The principle vhich they have adopted is one which, although, so far as we are aware, never before distinctly announced, is eminently fruitful and useful in devising means for the speedy and efficient administration of justice. The. Commissioners assume that the interest of the plaintiff is in general coincident with the interests of public justice, and that to him it may therefore safely be left in most cases to decide in what manner the cause shall be proceeded with. It is therefore left to his option to decide whether the summons shall be in the first instance for the settlement of imses or for a final decision. The whole amount of mischief which he can do by making a mistake in this respect is, that he may summon a person merely for the settlement of the issues in a cause which might have been decided at once, or summon the defendant to have his cause decided at once in a matter too weighty for a summary deq!sion; A power to impose costs in case this liberty is ablMed, and to- adjourn proceedings not ripe for decision, seems to be sufficient to remedy any attempt at oppression by a vexatious exercise of these laxe powers. We cannot, of coiurse, go into aU the details of this subject, nor examine all the pro' visions by which almost every objection that can occur seems to have been anticipated. We content ourselves with calling attention to these very remarkable provisions, referring those who may feel an interest in the subject to the very elaborate report out of which they have been extracted. We are the more anxious to do this, because we are not without apprehension that these proposals will have to contend in India with an amount of petty jealousy and unscrupulous opposition wlhich it is difficult for -us in England to understand, or even to imagine. Thus we find that a plan, the object and principal merit of which are the abolition of written pleadings, is censtured by a writer in the .riemd of India, who had never evidently read it, for preserving them entire; and the same cry, wvith equal ignorance and equal unscrupulousness, has been re-echoed throughout the Indian press. The declaration of independence, too, by the Indian Legislative Council, and the fate of Mr. SAcAurAy's Code, caused serious apprehension as to the possibility of obtaining in that body fair play for a system of exotic manufacture, the work mainly of English lawyers and retired Company's servants, having little be. yond its merits to recommend it. We pass from the consideration of the civil to that of the criminal code, and in this we have to note another striking improvement, perfectly applicable to criminal law as at present administered in England. Everybody knows that an indictment gives to the prisoner no information whatever as to the crime of which he is accused. It is a mere collection of legal gibberish, repetition, and tautology, the only practical result of which is that it sometimes serves to deliver a prisoner from wellmerited punishment, when a barrister is ingenious enough to detect a flaw in the technical description of the offence. This absurd form the Commissioners propose to abolish, and, instead of it, they direct that when a magistrate commits a prisoner for trial he shall send, together with the depositions, a charge describing the imputed offence as nearly as possible in the words of the penal code, and referring to the section under which it was drawn.- This charge is to be read over to the defendant on the trial, and he shall be asked whether he is guilty or not guilty, to which he will have much less difficulty in replying than is ordinarily felt by prisoners in this country when called upon tb plead to an indictment. There is an ample power to amend the charge during the trial, and on that charge, which is nothing more than the law applied to the case, the jiury will without difficulty deliver their verdict. We strongly recommend this change also to the consideration of the Law Amendment Society and all other associations and individuals who are labouring for the improvement of our laws. We have only selected two instances`6f the recommendations. of this report, but there are numerous others almost equally worthyofattention. The organizationofthe High Court, by which the same tribunal is made a court of appeal and of original jurisdiction, still continuing in the same court, and with the power of dividing itself as often as may be necessary for the purpose of exercising its jurisdiction, without requiring any machinery to transfer causes from one part of it to another, is a plan 'well worthy of the attentive consideration of the student of judicial mechanism. We may also notice the elaborate system of civil and criminal appeals, by which an efficient check is maintained over every Court, from the highest to the lowest' and the power is given-possessed, but rarely exercised, by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council-of preventing the necessity of a new trial by the examination of witnesses in the court of appeal. The powers of agreement also, by which the parties are enabled either to state a special case for the opinion of the Court, or to agree upon an isolated question of fact or law, to decide the controversy between them, are well worthy of attentive consideration. We have not left ourselves space to describe the intricate machinery which these plans are intended to replace. At present in India for the very smallest suit a maian can be invoWved in written pleadings, containing, it maybe, a declaration, a plea, a replication, and a rejoinder, interlarded with arguments, evidence, and the citation of legal authorities, till the puzzled Court finds it almost impossible to extract the real point at issue from this wonderful mass of irrelevant and impertinent matter. When we consider all these docu. ments must be upon stamped paper, and that, consequently, a tax upon justice is levied in its most oppressive form, we may easily imagine how it is that the English judicial system creates so much terror in India, and almost counterbalances the advantages derived from the justice and lenity of our rule. 1Here we have a substitute brought forward, upon. very high. authority, which we shall consider, till we are convinced of the contrary, to give in a very short compass a complete remnedy for these disorders. We shall be curious to see how long it Will be before the double or treble, Government of India can make up its mind to deal with the propositions submitted for its acceptance,-how many journeys to and from Caleutta this unforttuate blue-book is destined to make before it will be 81ifficiently ventilated and j purified from the dross of novelty to be fit for Indian legislation. Years of oppression and injustice have gone by, the whole face of English and European politics is qItered, and yet for the people of India Mfr. M&cAuLr.y,s wonderful Penal Code is still a dead letter. Why should we hope for better things for the Code of Civil Procedure ? To sit in-judgment on the opinions of the CHiEF JUSTIrC of the Common Pleas and the MAsTrP of the RoLrTs will be no small gratification to the independefit - Indian Legisleature. The Companpy have launched a scheme -of their own, of which ire will only say that it perpetuates written pleadings and refreshes the weary litigant with the prospect of thirteen heads of demurrer. Under these circumstances, the only refuge for the people of India ia in the Imperial Parliament, and we trust that the House of Conmnons, talding the broal and common-sense view that the Code of Procedure is not likely to be reviewed by any body more competent than that from which it originated, will adopt such steps as will save this new effort for the benefit of the people of India from that neg,lect and oblivion to which all preceding exertions on their behalf have been unifornly consigned.
There is still a very remote chance that the Pacific may not be lost, although. the delay of her appearance on one side of the Atlantic or the other gives too much ground for apprehension as to her fate. A correspondent whose letter appeared in our columns on Saturday last therefore argues that we have not at present any right to assume the fact of a fatal result, nor to relax in our efforts for carrying assistance to the missing ship. The chauces, he declares, in favour of the supposition that she is still afloat -with disabled machinery are not inconsiderable, and so we are bound to act as though this contingency were an ascertained fact. In the case of the Pacific, happily, there is no necessity for organizing a costly expedition, or of despatehing squadron after squadron upon a forlorn hope to the dangers of the Northern Pole. Seafaring men appear to agree in the conclusion that if the missing ship is above water at all she must be sought for in an area sufficiently circumscribed to render the process of investigation easy and expeditious. In the letter to which we allude the prevailing theory as to the probable situation of the Pacific, if she be still afloat, is set forth with sufficient clearness. The writer presumes that the machinery of this noble vessel may have given way somewhere about the Banks of Newfoundlanud ITn connexion with this probability two well ascertained facts must bc talken into account. The first is that the steamer relied mainly upon her steam power for her progress through the water. She had very little canvass, no bowsprit, scarcely any head or after sail. The next certainty is, that at the season of the year when she must have reached the waters in question hea,vy westerly gales play over the surface of the Atlantic. Against these it wouild be idle for any ship -to struggle unless her sailiEng powers were of a high order. The probabilities, then, are, that if the accident to the machinery occurred, as presumed, the captain of the Pacific would seek tb regain the Irish coast. Now, in this attempt he would have been foiled, becausewe quote fromn the letter of our correspondent"' throughout thLe month of FebrLary strong "4 southerly winds blew constantly between long. 4" 50' aud 44) west. On this coast, extending as "far west as15o, we have had easterly winds, with "occasional galesy almost without intermission, "since the 10th of February." The writer adds, that 30S ships are actually overdue from the westward-that a ship has just arrived fifty days out from New Yohrl, thirty of which were spent in battling with easterly winds, in soundings at the chops of the Channel. Surely, if all these data be true, there is nou reason yet for absolute despair as to the ising steamer, and we are bound by every consideration of duty and humanity to do our utmost for herrelief. The suggestion as to her proceedings and; actual position is as follows sc In retracing her couse across the Atintic the south winds must have drifted her to leeward, north of the route of passing vessels. On reaching the meridian of 15° her progress-eastwrd was effectually barred; she could not get to the eatwrar& or southward. In such an emergency she would havo heM on as well as she could, drifting slowly onrthwards on the western margin of the easterly -winds. If afloat-and no goodc eason exists for doubting that she isshe is probably within SO0 to 600 nmiles W.N.W. of Ireland, where she can be found andrescued by a searching squadrou of two ow three; or even one steamxer, sent from thes3 shores." The Pacifiv will soon have been two months at sea, and, as the number of human beings she carried, includimg passengers and crew, amounted to 186, the horrors of famine will inevitably be added to the other perils of her situation. We- know not that any word of ours ca-a give additional force to this simple statement of facts. It is just possible that this unfortunate steamer may now be driftiLg hither and thither within a few hundrednmiles of our coast, withut any chance of relief, save that which may be especially despatched writh a direct view to this objeet. Once out of the usual track of ships, the Pacific can expect no casiual assistance. Now, it is clear that, if the suppositions given above are founded on fact, she must have been blown or have drifted so far to the northward that she is cast out f-ora the fellowship of the sea, and therefore we must act, and act at once, or mak-e up our minds to abaedon the vessel to her fate. We have so much confidence in the spirit and humaanity 6f the country that wee feel sure an effort will be vigorously made to canry relief to these unfortunate people. One or two Government steamers woiuld- suffice. If they be still among the living, this is the only way in which they -can be saved; if they are already numbered among the dead, at least we shall have our consciences clear, and feel that all was done which man could do for their relief. The important point, however, is instant despatch. If the effort is to be made, it must be mnade now, without the loss of a day or an hour.

D)ARG ESCAPE OF A PRIso.NER FROxE GAoL.- On M-onday list Joseph Anderson, one of tho prisoners con. fined in -the new gaol at Southampton, made a daring and successful attempt to escape by means almost rivalling those recorded of Caleb Willims. Anderson, who appeared to be a travelling thief, was about two months since brought before the magistrates for picking the pocket of a woman, and his demeanour wvhen under examanation leading the magistrates to believe that he was an old offender, they determined, instead of dealing with the case smnmaril, to commit him for trial at the quarter sessions to be held in the ensuing ronth of April, with a view, in the meantime, of enablng informition to be elicited respecting him. Since his confinement-he has been suffering from rheumatism, which renders his escape the more extraordinary. It appears that during the absence of Mr. Brewer, the Governor of the gaol, at a meeting of the Finance Committee of the Corporation, the prisoner succeeded, about noon oni Monday, in opening his cell door by means of the plate used to denote his gaol numboer, having previonsy by some clever method prevented the lock from catching, varion6 marks on. the door bearing witness to the violent exertions which he must have used. Gaining access to the corridor, he was enabled unobserved to pass through -the doorleading intotheyard usedfor the exercise of the prisoners. Here a number of workmen had been employed in. the erecSion of a building intended to contain a treadmill and crank wheel for the prison'ers sentenced to hard labour, and the prisoner was lucky enough to arriye here just asthe whole of them had gone to dinner. Having procured from this building a shovel, heheapedupaquantity of earth, and, haaving placedupon it &mortar-board to secure a good foundation,-he placed upon it a saffold-board, which, when in nearly an upright position, reached to within a few feet of the top of the alL A short ladder enabled him without diiSlcultyto ascendto a distance of about tWo-thirds of the scaffold-board, the remainder of which he climbed in an ex!ceedingly clever mantner, balancing himself with the greatest sklli until he reached a sficient height to enable htimtoX i gan the top of the wa having attained which ht dropped himself down on the other sde, and escapcd.

ECOND EDITION. T1'E TIMESOFF:ICE, Monday Merning. EXPRESS FROM PARIS. 'Tlhe following is the letter of our Paris corret2ondent, dated yesterday, 6 p.m.:- It w.as confidently reported yesterday, and with every appearance of truth, that the labours of the Congress were last night to be brought to a conclusion. It was even affirmed that the Treaty of Peace would be signed at the same time, so that the Aoniteur might be able to announce it this morning, a few hours only before the celebration of the TeDe?um in thanksgiving of the Empress's safe delivery of a Prince. The effect would have been fine-while the 5cO'e!fL strain was pealing beneath the roofs of every -cathedral in France, that the thunder of cannon -zshould announce the consummation of the work of peace. On suchi occasions people hardly content themselves with the bare truth, and we are now assured that so certain was the Emperor of the signing of the treaty that orders had been given for illuminations in the Ministerial offices. It may be ;so; the fact is not important; but of the confidence witlh which the conclusion of peace was looked forM ard to I have no doubt. When the Plenipotentiaries separated on Thurssday last it was understood that the next meeting shoulcd tale place on Saturday; and up to Friday night the hour remained the same at which they usually assembled. Notice, however, was sent round that it was necessary the Congress should meet earlier than usual. There was a good deal of business to get through, and it was desirable to meet as soon, and separate as late as possible. A Ministerial journal hadl prepared the public for the expected solution by stating that, after three days' work by the Plenipotentiaries in committee, " tne sitting of yesterday would not fail to be important." In one or two quarters it was mysteriously whispered that the discussion would be an animated, and, at its close, noc a satisfactory one. On the authority of other and more sanguine parties it was affirmed, on the contrairy, that the business of yesterday would be of the 1ihtest, and would hardly be more than affixing signatures and shaling hands. I regret to say that the more agreeable prediction has not been realized. Unanimity did not prevail at the sitting of yesterday, or, if unanimity nearly prevailed, the dissentients, whoever they may be, were sufficiently powerful to disappoint the expectations of the public. The discussion was not so amicable as had been anticipated, and so far from a treaty of peace being signed at the close of the meeting, there is reaeon to fear that no one cau positively say when that treaty will be signed, or whether the difficulties that are now in the way will be removed during the -ensuing-week. I do not mean to affirm they will not, but I doubt if any one can fix the period when they will; and thotigh I am far from stating or believing that the: solution of the Conferences will be otherwise than pacific, I fear we are at this moment more -distant from that solution than we were supposed - to be 10 days ago. Difficulties have arisen -which I hope are not insurmountable, buit which maytake time to remove. That time is felt to be very precious in every respect, and not least in a financial point of -ieir. Indeed, the loss incurred is considerablein men aswell as money. Typhusisraginginthe army, and the expense incurred by 14 or 15 days' unnecessary delay in the Crimea is calculated for the English at about 20,000,000f.; for the French about 15,U00,000f. Ourarmistice expires on the 31st, and it is denied, though I can hardly credit the denial, thatit will berenewed ; but even if it be renewed, an act of indiscretion on thepartof a general offlcer, of a diplomatic agent, or even of inferior persons, may add new complications, as if there were not enough already. You will agree with me that the cause must be a serious one indeed which would justify -so much loss. That a cause, great or amall, important or trifling, exists, there is no doubt. Bat what can it be? everybody asxs. Were we not told from the beginning of the present week that nothing -could be more satisfactory than the progress of the negotiations ? Indeed, the Russians were so con-ciliatingthat theyseemed to regret thatno more was asked of them; the Austrians appeared resolved not to be offended by any scowls or sarcasm from -Count Orloff; and the Prussians were said to be as meek as mice. In fact, everything went on, -or was said to go on, "merrily as a marriage bell," when all of a sudden the scene changes. I think I c :n guess the cause of that change. I believe it to be owing to the demand put forth yesterday by the rrussian Plenipotentiaries to be admitted to sign the Traty of Peace on the same footing and in the same character as if Prussia had been a party to the -alliance throughout, as if she had accepted all the obligations involved in it, had joined in the ntitiTnation, and had declared that she would abide by all its consequences. Such it seems are the pretensions of Prussia at this moment, and I believe that in these pretensions she has the support of Russia, if not of others. That these pretensions are opposed in the Congress is evident from their preventing the Conferences being brought to a conclusion yesteri'ay; but by wa7lat Powers in par ticular I am iunable to say. Of the main fact of their being put forwarrd, and of their being the principal, if not the sole, cause of this unforeseen delay, I think- I can safely assure you. By some persons such a cause is considered, if not trifling, at least not sufficient to justify the serious conse-quences that may follow. By others, I suspect, real importance is attached to it. I do not take upon myself to decide as to who is right, or who is wrong; I content myself with repeating that the delay in signing the treaty of peace, expected yesterd&y, is attributable to the opposition offered to the demand of Prussia to be admitted on ternms of equality with the great Powers, and that I cannot say when that demand or that opposition will be withdaawn. It is a remarkabIe as well as an unpleasant eir-cumstance, that Prince. Jerome, the uncle, and Prince Louis Lucien, cousin of the Emperor, should both, in consequence of circumstances beyond.their -control, have been unable to sign the Acke cle Nais.eslce of the infant Prince. It is owing to these cir-cumstances that only two witnesses, instead of four, appear in the programmne.of the ceremonial observed -on the occasion. A Te De-itm was chanted to-day at Notre Dame, a3 in all the cathedrals of France, in thanksgiving for the Empress's delivery. The Ministers and -other public functionaries were present in uniform. The Emperor was not present, nor tlle Diplomatic Corps. The Emperor and Empress will both attend the Te Deum in June, on the occasion of thle solemn vaptism of the Prince. Prince Jerome's improvement is going on wiThout interruption. It was announced to-day at the Patlais Royal that no more bulletins would be iEtted.' The Miiiister of Finance, M. Magne, gives a ,rand dinner on Tuesday to the Plenipotentiaries, ;nrd a bal Mi the course of the evenin- 'THE ARMIIY IN THE CRIMEA. (FMxI -,oU! OWWN COBRSPONDENT.) CAMJP BEI- ORE SEBASTOPOL, MlRcIr 10. it seems as if the armistice were likely to expire (efore its termns are settled. The first difficulty arese u1pon the dem and of the allies to. embark things in boats from the south side of the harbour, '.he object being to ship the canno, ancihors, lc., cjIttared in Scbastopcl, But to tii is the Russians demurred, saying that the seaboard was not ours, and that we could not use it. This is perfectly true, and is a striking commentary upon the oft-repeated vaunt, that Sebastopol is captured. We have certainly got the town, but the north forts command it, and not a cock-boat can put off fromn shore without imminent danger of being sunk. However, the allies agreed to waive the stipulation, and the delay now arise3 from certain questions relating to the blockade of ithe Black Sea and the Sea of Azoff. This I know to be the case, although I cannot state what those questions are, but I am assured that they are not of grave importance. Nevertheless, they retard the formal conclusion of the armistice, but meanwhile the suspension of fire (after all, the chief point) endures. We are not quite so intimate with our Muscovite friends; our enthusiasm or curiosity has a little subsided, and, moreover, General Orders and sentries are there to check it; but we may be'said to be on terms of distant civility. It is probable that there will be another meeting of Generals this week at Traktir Bridge. There is no truth in a report that was lately spread here that the Third and Fourth Divisions were to go down to Inkermann and the Tchernaya to relieve the French. No changes are contemplated in the present positions of our troops until the result of the Conferences at Paris be known or the armistice be over. Tlle war-party still cherishes hopes that the negotiationsmaybreak down. If anything lessthanthefull conditions, including the dismantling of Nicolaieff,be accepted, there willbe a pretty outcry amongst the martially disposed, and truly it will hardly have been worth while going to war. It may suit the French to make concessions, but it ought not to suit us. They doubtless consider that they have done enough for honour and glory, and to revenge the reverses of 1812. Like sensible men, they have made the most of what they have done, have blown a loud trumpet for every success, and have kept reverses as much as possible in the background, thereby dazzling the distant and gaining in prestige. They probably think they have little to get by carrying the war into Asia, and stil less by destroying the Russian fleet in the Baltic, which would render the English navy more than a match for the united navies of the world; and, moreover, they cannot afford war as England can ; and their army, however numerous they may show it to be upon *paper, is dwindling sadly. Scurvy and fever are playing havoc in its ranks.. I recently stated its daily loss at 170 men, but reserving a doubt, although my information was pretty trustworthv, for I hoped and believed that the number was exaggerated. I can now tell you positively that the French admit the present naortahity in their army to be 120 a-day, and on some days considerably more. The right of the army, in the Baidar Valley, suffers the most. I am assured that the deaths there have reached 100 pei; diem. When the mild weather sets in a great increase of iisease is to be anticipated. 3Iuch that is harmless now will be noxious then, and we must expect our own sick returns to swell, but those of the French will, I fear, be terrible. Whatever slight jealousies may have existed between the two armies, our brave allies should not for an instant doubt that their sufferings are deplored and warmly sympathized with by this army. Last winter's trials are far from forgotten by the limited number who endured them and still survive, and we might have been justified in hoping that the sad experience was not lost upon the French. Then we heard nothing of their sufferings; the English army was decimated, but the French were supposed to be healthy and well supplied. But last winter was far severer and more trying than this one, so that the natural deduction is, either that the French suffered far more than was known during the trying five monthsfrom the beginning of November, 1854, to the end of March, 1855, or that the preparations for this winter and the sanitary precautions taken havebeenveryinadequate. I do not hesitate to say that the French army is being expended at least as rapidly as it was by shell and shot during the severest part of the siege. A sanitary commission's investigation of the French camp would reveal a startling amount of suffering. Insufficient shelter and covering, and a deficiency of vegetable food, readily account for the sickness that prevails. Of course, everythingwecan spareisfreelyplacedattheir disposal. They have availed themselves to a considerable extent of our offers of service, but I was surprised to learn that they declined a quantity of warm clothing offered to them the other day, saying they did not want it. This is incomprehensible. Under canvas in such weather as we have lately had, how can a soldier have too much warm clothing? Evenwith such comparative comforts as we enjoy, it must not be supposed that we do not at times sharply feel the inclemency of the weather. During the late snow storms-the heaviest known in the Crimea since the allies entered it-there were few huts into which the snow did not make its way in quantities, drifting through crevices unperceived in moderate weather. The warmest (butnot the most healthy) huts here are those built after the Bulgarian fashion, sunk some three or four feet below the groutndj the walls above being of stone, the roofs generally of planks, covered outside with tarred tents and tarpaulins, and lined within with blankets. Even in these, notwithstanding fires kept up late and lighted early, the water froze last week. In above-ground huts the freezing was much more extensive and prolonged. On Saturday evening, in a hut where there was a large fire of coal, and where four or five persons were assembled until midnight there was no getting the thermometer-hanging i the hut, near the door, but within 15 feet of the fire-above freezing point. At times it would go tup a degree or two, bat it obstinately sank again to 32. Saturday night was one of the coldest we have had this year. Tubs of water in the huts were frozen to a depth of three inches. Soda-water, to which we have recourse, when obtainable, as a substitute for the filthy wvater to which we are frequently condemned, became one mass of granulated ice, and forced its way out between the cork and the glass. When thawed, the quantity wasreduced a third, and the effervescing quality gone. If such be the state of things in huts where every possible precaution is taken to exclude the cold, what must it be in tents ? I do not mean in double tents, 'well dug out, which are not bad abodes, buit in single tents, such as the Frencl live in. It is really painful to meet the French convoys of sick. They are not often seenprobably precautions are taken that they should not be-but sometimes one falls in with them. I met one on Saturday, lbetween our head-quarter and those of the French. It consisted of 50 patients, en cacolet on mules, escorted by a few red-capped soldiers and non-commissioned officers, who seemed but ill-pleased with their painful duty. The -nules were slipping along the hard-frozen road; the sergeant in charge was grumbling audibly; most of the sick men (poor, yellow, emaciated wretches) bore the stamp of death uPon their contracted and suffering faes. Our army, abundantly fed and cared for sat an immense expense, may be well content with its present quarters, but assuredly it will be a joyful day for our allies when they tumn their back on this inhospitable peninsula and sail for la belce Frawc. From the Ist to the 9th of the prosent month the thermometer at the Castle Hospital atBalaldava, where a register is kept, has ranged from 11 deg. to 49 deg. Here, where we are several hundred feet higher, the temperature is low&'r. Yesterday wS as beautiful day. The sun w'as hot, and meltedice and snow wherever its ray& &l, except uponmvr ih groLund. The afternoon view from the Crow's Ne3t above Balaklava was magnificent. The sea, reposing from its late violent agitation, was calm as a lake There were no vessels outside, but a few smnall boats glided pleasantly over the tranquil surface. The harbour is full compared to what -it lately was, but not in comparison to what we have been accus. tomed to see. WVe have had several arrivals this last week, and niumerous drafts of troops forvarious regimentshavecome in. The Guards have received several hundred men, and are nowr 3,100 strong. Yesterday some strong detachments of the line marched up from Balaklava, and a band weent out to meet them and play them into camp. The fiesh coIImplexions of the men and their scantly allovance of beard contrasted -with the weathered hirsute aspect of the veteran part of the army. One met officers in fresh smart uniforms, and horses with regular English clothing, which they will need, and more besides, in our imperfect Crimean stables. Judging from whatwasyesterdaytobe seen, thereisamistaken idea as to the quality of horseflesh required out here. Strong hardy animals are needed for this service-beasts that can go across a heavy country, and be none the worse for standing afew hours in rain and cold, with only a blanket to protect them. To-day is fine and sunny. The " First Spring Meetirig" is to come off, weatlher permitting, on the 24th inst. The Albatross is the name of the cattle ship which suffered so severely on- its passage hither. 140 of the cattle die;. The injuries sustained by the captain were exaggerated. He has a simple fracture of the thigh, which, however, is likely to layhimuup for six months. He is in hospital at Balakilava. He could hardly be in a better place for getting well. He is probably in the General Rospital, but-the Castle Hospital is perhaps the best in the world for the rapid healing of wounds, as is proved by its returns. In the three months ending the 31st of September, out of 1,479 cases, there were only 39 deatlhs, being about 2 3.5ths per cent. A few of the cases were of disease, but deducting these the deaths were only 3%- per cent. Considering the severity of many of the wounds, this per centage is extraordinarily low. Notwithstanding the changes of weather, the increase of admissions to the camp hospitals during the past week has been very small. Catarrhs have, of course, been rather more numerous, but there does not appear to have been an increase worth naming in diseases of a serious character. In one division, 7,000 strong, there was but one death, and that fromapoplexy inducedbydrunkenness. Thesamedivi. sion has less than 280 men in hospital, about 4 per cent. ; and if strong drinks were less easy to procure it is the opinion of the medical men that illness would be diminished 75 per cent., and that the army here would be as healthy as the Turkish Contingenlt at Kertch. It is all very well for commanding officers to estinate drunkenness by the amount of punishment for that crime, to make an arbitrary allowance for the cases that escape notice, and so to prove in a most conclusive manner, according to them, that there is only a very minute amount of intoxicati9n in the army. In this manner the notorious fact is igaored that many soldiers, who fear punishment, convey spirits int3 their tents and drink it there of a night. By the morning they have slept off the immediate effects of the excess, and no one is the wiser, save the surgeon, who traces, in his hospital practice, the germ or aggravation of many a disease to the detestable raki and other deleterious compounds. There can be no question that drunkeiness has diminished in this army, but many who do not get openly and disgustingly drank take much more than does them good. Most soldiers who go out for an afternoon's walk and holyday, seem to consider that they have not enjoyed then-melvaq unless they have drunkrather, or much, more than they can bear. It is surprising that the experiment has never been tried of closing the canteens that so abound in all directions. If, as I understand, the plan has been found possible of execution and advantageous in its effects at Scutari depot, close to a large town, and where there are so many facilities for the clandestine sale of spirits, it surely could have been carried out in a camp. Instead of that, the sutler's trade finds such perfect liberty as amounts to encouragement. Any knavish Greek or Levantine who can raise a tent orhut, and a supply of cheap spirits, appears to be at liberty to do so. If regulations and limits exist they are certainly very lax and wide. Here, in the heart of the camp, between the 1st and 4th Divisions, and withinfive minutes' walk of the 2d, 3d, and Light, Donnybrook is allowed to spring up. Have shops if necessary, but why permit spirits to be sold? And if they are to be vended, why not put the sale on a different footing? Instead of having canteens kept bygreedyand unscrupulous foreigners, who care not what poison they sell so long as they make their inoney, they should be held by non-commissioned officers, umder strict inspection and regulationasto the quality andprice of the articles. There can be no plea of impossibility opposed to the adoption of such a system, which I have heard advocated by military men of much experienc'e. Read-quarters are greatly shocked- at ievelati6is, by Ietters to England, concerning "ditchesandguns," andother matters they desire to keep secret from the enemy. Do they not think it possible that, by allowing the offscourings of the Mediterranean to settle themselves down- in a camp, they may be harbouring ready, active, and competent spies for the Russians ? They should pull down the canteens and ship the keepers of them to their native country. This should have been done.long ago, but it is not too late even nowi, when we are supposed to be on the eve of peace. Notwithstanding poisoners and imprudence, however, the army preserves its health to a very satisfactory extent. In one division that I know of there were 192 deaths (from disease, eiclusive of wounds) in the month of February, 1855. In. February, 1856, it was 1,200 or 1,500 men stronger than in the corresponding month of the previoui year, but its deaths from disease were but 4. WVe have only to compare last year's misery, exposure, and want of sanitary precaultions, with the abundance and care that now everywhere prevail, to ex. plain this most satisfactory contrast. But this is not a case in which well should be let alone. Thera is very little illness in the army, that is granted, but 'if it can be made much less by closing canteens why should not this be done? The ration of ram is sufficient for most of the men, as far as doing them any good goes; in cases of particularly hard work or exposure it is not unusual to give them an extra allowance-; if there be men who, as a general rule, need, for their health's sake, more than- the ration, let the doctors certify and the spirits be issued. Bat these last cases would be, I suspect, of very rare oocurrence. - TUESDAY, MAcH 1L. The wind has got- round to the south a-id blows fresh. The temperature is moderate and the sky eloudy. The flag liaa just been run up in the Light Division, as a signal that the mail due yesterday has arrived, butthelettersha-ve not yet-been distributed. TURKY;Y (FaoxpunP OWN COn"oNmUr.) -**CONSTANT1NOPLE, BlancH 13). The Tynemouth arrived two days ago from Malta, - with troops for the Crimea. She stopped only to take' in Coals, and starte ag ain yesterday. The improvement in-the Fieiich- hospitals is continuing, but it amounts as yet only to so muci that there,- is no irwreas in the average, number of sick coming daiy to thte hospitals.. Mhe repeated, olfers of General Storks have at last suomde4 in making the Intendance accept some Port wie. - In Scitiari the hospitals become anptier every day; most of the patients have only triffingg complaints, and a fever case is a rarity. If it lasts the medical men will have to fight for patients. The cavalry homes are in beautiful condition, an1 the men in first-rate order. I heard that tLe eommanding officer of one of the regiments expreseel it as his opinion that he never had seen his regiment in better condition during the whole timle he had served in it. The only shady side of this pictture of military efficiency in Sciitari is some desertions in the German Legion. The rate of wages is like everything else, very high in this place, and this serves as an inducement to them for desertion. As most of them speak- several languages, a situation in a cafe or restairnowt is easily found, and the difficulty of discovering their place of refuge flatters them with the hope of escaping with imnpunity. Several of the deserters have, however, been brought back and slhlut up in the prison cells, where they wMil have time for refleation. The five gunboats, Croaker, Clinker, Boxer, Grinder, and Fancy, went out yesterday for a trial to the Sea of Marmora. They went about 15 iiiles, and performed manceuvres, forming in line of battle and columns, and had a race coming back. The speed was very good, about nine lkots an houir, and the race was won by the Boxer, closely followed, neck to neckl, by the Clinker. This morning Omar Pasha, with some officers of his staff, arrived here from Trebizonde. The vessel came in last night and cast anchor at 13ujukdere. A part of his army had already arrived in Trebizonde, fromn edout-Kaleh, aud the restis exs pected there shortly. Thle weather on the southeastern shore of the Black Sea had been very bad. Yesterday the embarkation of the Russian prisoners detained on the Prince's Island, began on I-oard the Christophe Colomb and thle Montezuma. i General Kochanovitch, taken at Kinburn, 58 officers, and 1,800 non-commissioned officers and privates, are among them.

During the last few days the Vienna Exchange has displayed great heaviness, and the phenomenon is thus explained by an experienced minancier * 'Baron Bruck- has committed the mistaLe of providing too liberally for the moneyed world. No man can, with comfort to himself, eat as much at one meal as he is accustomed to-do at three, and no place can in one year digest as much paper as would suffice for three years. The Minister of Finances is going on much too fast, and if he is not more cautious we shall, before the world is a year older, have a regular crisis." It has been decided by the Ministers of the Interior aiid Justice, and the Chief of the Police, that persons' who in the Lombardo-Vlenetian kingdom and in the Tyrol shall be accused of being in possession of prohibited weapons and ammunitioi, shall be tried by the usual civil Courts, and not by the military auithorities. As a consequence of the inhabitants of Transylvania having been without any fire arms for four or five years, no fewer than 843 wolves and 135 bears were killed in that province in 1855. The Duke of Galliera, who was one of the adminislrators of the Cr6dit Mobilier. sent 'in his resignation, which was accepted vem. con. Reliable information has to-day been given me that LML de Balabine, who is now at the head of the Russian Embassy, and Count Stackelberg were also present at the solemn service which was performed the day before yeste:day in the French Church, but they were not in uniform, na were the members of the other Iegations. We learn by the Triester Zeitung that a very- lsi±ge edifice, which is to serve as a school for midshipmen, has just been completed at Fiume. ITALY. We read in theIParma Gazette, of the 18th inst. : "' At 7 o'clock last evening, when the Auditor of War, Gaetanu Bordi, was walkdng in the street Bassa de Magnani wvith another officer, he was treacherously stabbed in the back with a poniard by an uniknown hand. The assassin, having precipitately fled, could not be arrested. Lieutenant Bordi, supported by two soldiers, was conveyed to the office of the Commander, where he received mediml relief and the consolations of religion. At 3 o'clock he was carried to his house. His life is in the greatest danger. " In consequence of this atrocious attempt, the following Sovereign a^t ard proclamation has been issued:- 'We, Louise Mfarie de Bourdon, governing for Duke Robert L, the States of Parma, &c.; " 'Murderous bands have once more sacrificed two inno. cent victims to their infamous designs, and struck with dismay and horror the peaceable population of this city. Those horrible attempts fill our heart with sadness and pain. Our intentions were and are clement, but we cannot forget that it is our sacred duty to protect honest people against the wicked, and to adopt rigorous and efficient measures solely directed ag,ainst the latter. With that object we have enacted the following:- " 'Ait.

The Cortes adjourned at the close of yesterday's sitting til this day week. This suspension of the sittings may be advantageous at this juncture, by giving time for conferences, with the view of coming to an accord upon the financial question. The Progresista deputies met last night at. the Congress to the number of 100 or upwards, and a plan submitted by the Committee, by which the amoumt now asked for by the Government (120,0.00,000 of reals) wvas proposed to be raised, though in a different way from that of Senor Santa Cruz, was favourably received; but no definitive resolution was adopted beyond that of voting -the Government the sum required; while many deputies, who . had presented variouns other schemes in the General Committee on the Budget, expressed their wiUlingiiess to withdraw them in favour of some joint plan. The Committee, added to other deputies who have taken a prominent part in filiance questions, meet again to-day, and will meetj daily for the present. The new plan recommended by Senors Calatrava, Sanchez, Silva, and others, proposes to raise 120,000,000, partly by an increase of the direct taxes, by an impost to be levied on towrns, &c., being the amouint. paid by them for gate dues or excise on wines and spirits; by a tax of 10percent. on the dividends of the internal debt, and by a graduated tax on salaries and pensions ; but the meetings and conferences of the Committee with the Government may lead to modifications.in this plan. A strong feeling was generally expres3ed against the restoration under any name of the former gateand exciseduties. General San Miguel arrived before the close of the m6etinfg and gave in 'his adhesion to it, and several other deputies tent-in, lieeirs. Senors. M1adoz, sgncl~ei, Silva, a~Ch~csesio au~ thes,addreaaed the meeV- ing, which will re-assemble vhen the Committee and other deputies now added to it have come to a final accord on the subject, and asertained Espartero's sentiments -respecting the plan they may adopt. The members of the Centro-Parlamentario met also last night, abouit 50 in number, at the house of thle MaLrquis of Perales. Senor Avecilla prWosed that a O nmittee snhonld be nmued to confer -with that of thi Progre3ista meeting, but it was opposed. by Senors Boda and Bayarri, and rejected b?y themnembers preselnt, who finalUy agreed to support the Ministerial, scheme, and to convoke another meating, which all the deputies who are Government esplpoy6s are to be invited to attend. 'The statement that the Madrid and Almansa R-ailway, with its continuation to Alicante, men- tioned in the joumals here, has been purchased by! the Grand Central of France, in conjunction with Messrs. PRothschild's house, is now contradicted. The purchase, if completed, appearstobelimitedtothe Madrid and Almansa line, which they are said to be desirousto continue toCarthagena. Senor Campas, of 1Valencia, has the concession for its extension from Alimansa to that place, and Senor Salamanca has a contract with a company formed at Alicante for continuing it from Almansa to the latter. The company authorized by the Cortes under the name of General Company of Credit in Spain, and of which MM. Prost and others are the founders, has deposited the sum requisite for competing for the Seville and Jerez line. Much confasion is occasioned-by so many Credit companies being authorized here at the same moment. Besides the Catalan Credit Company, three others were sauctioned by the Cortes on January the 28th, under the following denominations, ancd in the order in wlhioh they were voted -_ "1. hM.

The Grenett, a Hanoverian vessel, was lost. off Yarmouth with all hands. The Hero, a schooner, from Bye for Newcastle, parted from both anchorsin Lowe. stoft south roads, and was obliged to rin upon the main opposite the Royal HoteL The Henry, a brig, from Meontrose for London, also drifted on the main near Pakefield Lighthouse, and other minor disasters are reported. :I)AU H:GnwAY ROBBERay.-On Thursday night last a most daring 'robbery wasUretrated upon the person of Mfr. Blsekmore, of the , at Creech. It appears that Mr. Blackmore had been on his fortnightly visit to Exeter transacting business, and returned thence by the 9 p.m. up train. His son, whfio had been tD Bridgerwter, -and had returned home before -his father,-went -to meet him at the station wvith a horse and giY.. Directly after thearival of the train the a proceededhomelyards and had reached the Chard cinal-bndge, -hisk is within *sight of Mr. Blatknoreh residence, wvhen: -they were suddenly startledhby three men jumping out from behind the boridge. The men, VOwh wore white smock frocks and wtde. awake bats, had their faces covered with blaclk masks, and were each armed with a pistol. One of the rfians immediately secured the horse by the head, whHile another went up to the son, and presenting a pistol at his head ex-- claimed, "If, you movo I will blow your brainsout." The third robber made towards Ir. Blacl;more, sen., and said, '- Old - chap, you are the man I hiave been lookiag for for -some timue past."'. Mr; Blackmore asked him ,what he wanted, -when he answered, " Yor money or your life," at the same time presenting a pistol. Mfr. Blaclkmore said he had -not any money about him. This, however, did:not satisfy. tho robbersi and one of tkhni dragged Mr. Blackmore out of the gig, and began unbuttoning his- greatcoat. They then proceeded to ransack his -pockets apid took from him the whole of his money (about 7001.) Riving secnred this booty the robbers made their escape before any alarm covld be given.- The whole affair did not oc6npy lore 'than about five minutes, and the odds being so fearfully against Mr. Blackmore and his -on they were unable to-make any resistance. Perhaps it Was for-' tunate for them they did not, or their lives might have been madeto piy the forfeit. As soon as J1r.

SIR JOH2 }ZJEPSCHEL AND 2'EE SOCIETY OF ARTS EXAMINATIONS. The following letter has been addressed by Sir J. Herschel to the Secretary of the SQcietyof Arts :_ " Collhngwood, arch 19. " Sir,-I cannot have the smallest objection to ating the grounds on which- I have subscribed the declarationa of confidence in the certificates of prbflciency about to be awarded by the Society of Arts to the young men who offer themselves for examination as proposed in the circular accompanying it. It cannot but be of very great importance to those who have situations to fill up in the several depart. ments of active life to obtain a knowledge, independent of the partial opinions of recommending friends, of the positive quaifications of the young persons who may offer themselves as candidates for such situations in the immense majority of cases when such tests of merit as universityhonours or distinctions of a similar kind are oiut of the question. This is a want on the part of the public as yet unsupplied, aud the exaunple of what is being, attempted in the departments of the civil as well asnmilitary service of the country may, I think, very advantageously be foUowed in comumercial and industrial pursuits of a private nature ; and I think the Society of Arts, by volunteering the initia. tive in undertaldng this duty, is doing good service to the country. MIy confidence in the fairness and impartiality of the awards is based on the publicity of the whole proceed. ing, on the high-character of the society, and on the list or examiners, which comprises many names which I conside4 as guarantees for the rectitude and uprightness of theirawards, and for the reasonable conduct of the examinations themselves in reference to the objects to be attained. "I have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant, "J. F. W. ERSCIIZfr. "The Rev. T. Booth, Chairman of the Council of the Society of Arts."
A PLEA FOBt M. KOSSTH. --Ob TO THE EDITOR OF TEHE TIMES. Sir,-I have no right, and, in truth, but little hope, to expect that Imay induce you to advocate the cause ofKossath. Politicaly, I know you axe adverse to him; morally, I am confident you are not. I now appeal to:, your candour, impartiality, and geDerosity. It is only this morning I hear that the illustrious exile is in straitene4l circumstances. Trusted by all the highest, bravest, most virtuous of his countrymen, appintetl by them to the first station, and holding their wealth at his disposal, he lived among them, sad departed from them, poDr. The jewels of the Hungarian cro-A lay at his fet hi spurned them, -S he spurned the usurper and perjurer who hid wofn the.d ' :f;litary treason:necessitated his fliht; the valour of B3m. and Gnyon was insufficient against the enemy. The representative of Mahomet saved the follower of Christ from the vengeance of the Apostolic; the Caliph cast his mantle over thewounded, and defied the uplifted swordL Kossuth at lasb toolk refuge in England. Here he was welcomed in everr city by the magistrtes andthe people, andeven by those of the nobility who were not Germanized by the Court. Among us there are some remaining whose affections are not torx pefied nor chilled by contact with adversity. Let us see how many there are of them. I will not close my eves until I maLe this appeal to you, declaring most solemnly that I have had no conversation or correspondence on ther subject with the exile of Hungary; I have not asked, directly or indirectly, his permission to make the appeal, and I fear I may want his countenance; but what I am now doing I feel to be a duty. Let me hope,however, and trusb that the most eloquent of statesmen since Demosthenes will not refuse that publEc tribute which another of mach cel. brity accepted. Mr. Fox had squandered a large fortune i: the most pernicious of vices-in gambling. :Eossath had no Tiches and no vices; he left a Incrative and honourable profession to rescue his outraged country. Mr. Fox committed an act of treason, or very similar, by sending an agent to the Empress Eatharine, assuring her that she might safely take possessioa of Nootka Sound, against the just claims of England. The speeches of Ylr. Fox never elevated the soul, never enlarged the intellect, never tonched the heart. Ha upheld the cause of France against England throughout the war, even while her best citizens were bleeding on the scaffold. Kossuth upheld the cause of Hungary, not only throughout the war, but throughout years more disastrous. Only one orator and statesman ever acted with so muchl ability, consistency, and energy; he, too, was an exile. Demosthenes, a victim crowned with imperishable glory, walked calmly forth from the temple of Poseidon and shuooc hands with Death, sparing his enemy the guilt of his murder. May we Englishmen be exempted from a guilt almost as heinous .-the guilt of seeing die among us, with. out onr sympathy and without our help, a man as virtous, as ardent an orator, and as pure a patriot-the one PanHellenic. the other Pan-European.

THE TRrEATAma OF DLRAX:A IDi TE CRThiRA.' -The following is an extract from a report addressed by Dr. J. R. Taylor, Deputy Inspector-General of Hospitals, to. Dr. Hall:-" Asregards the medicines that have been found. most useful, it would a ppear, by the accompanyin reports,. that either castor oil, rhubarb, or a mild mercu-rialhas verr generally been administered in the first instance, and counter-irritation of the abdomen by hot water, and turpentine in mustard employed at the same time. Some medicat officers, objecting to the 'ordinary class of astringents as useless or even mischievous, have resorted to small doses of dilute sulphuric acid, vithor without opium; The surgeons of the 14th and 39th Regiments pronoutnce very favoarably of this medicine. Others, however, declare in favour of the various compounds of chalk vith aromaties, .opiuam, Dover's powder, vith catechu, &c. Quinine appears to be generally resorted to in ces becoming chronic or mixed with fever or following fever, and is used in combination with opium when the diarrhoia is merging into dysentery. ZMr. De Lisle, surgeon to the 4th Regiment, says, 'Bottles ale and porter and good fresh meat were the best remedies. Ifercuriass were better than astingents, and I derived bat little assistance from quinine.' In all cases attention to diet and regimen has been regaraed as most essential."Lancet. . -THE JosErHNE WmiTs.-The divers employ.. under the supefintendence of Captain Nott, I.N., speciW agent to Lloyd's, have this week succeeded in recovering from the wreck of the Josephine Willis a quantity of passengeir'.lu gge, also the effects of Catain Canney, and a box of jewelryof considerable value. e effects of Captain Canney were restored to his widow, free of all salvao charges.

OF AN 131PosToR.-A case of attempted fraud, and an assault, the sequel to which wvas the death of t'he impostor, occurred on Thulsday at Northstoke, nearB3ath. On that day a stranger visited Swinford, where he made some inq%uiries, and then procedede to tho neighbouring village of bpton, where he entered a publichouse. .After inquiring the names of some principal inhabitants of the locality he wrote a letter and was observed to append two unmes to it.

TfIE CAPITULATION OF LARAS. (Continued from 17te Tima, of March 22). 1 In tlhe me^ntime the neglect at Constantinople ! had continued. Requisitions for boots and other i necessaries foN the cavalry remained unnoticed, and on the 14th of May a staff-officer meeting the regiments from Kurdistan, coming into line at Toprak Kaleh, observed "' the greater portion of the men riding in theirstockings r` Haathe followingdocument been sent to General Williams, insteadof Lord Clarendon, it would probably have reached him exactly at the same time wfith the intelligence of this astounding fact, having beenl delivered at the Eng-, lis'hl emlbassy ona the 3d of Eay. - (Translation.) "The Sublimxe Porte has entered into communication sith his Highness the Seraskier Pasha ulpon the subject of the tw o papers which have arrived from Erreroum, and which your Excellency transmitted to the Sublime Porte, relating, to the state of the Imperial ary in Asia, and theI points containei in those papers have been taken into cons,ideration. "The SeraskPer Fasha has made known to the Sublime Forte what follows -l "'IThe necessary arms have been sent to the army in Asia; and, inoreovcr, the Mushir in commandof that army says not a word on the necesaityand want of arms.

" As to the augmentation of the forces in Asia, his Highness the Seraslier Pasha has informed the Sublime Porte that he has addressed a special despatch to the Commanderin-Chief, Om3r Pasha, instructing himnto ask the opinion of the Generals of the armies of the auxilaryPowers upon this point; measuris will, therefore, be taken upon this subject accordingto the answer which we shall receive. "1 have the honour to bring this to the knowledge of your Excellency, &c. " 14 Shaba4 1271." But the last days of Mfay were occtupiOa in other and more pressing business even than that of collecting stores. The time for preparation had gone by; and all that now remained was, by courage, energy, and patience, to endeavour to eke out the scanty means of resistance which, after adl efforts made, had alone been provided. General WVillians had at first expected an attack from the enemy on the line of Bayazid, as in the year, before. In order to understand his position, a reference to the map will be necessary. Erzeroum, the capital of Armenia, is connected with Trebizonde on the southerni coat of the Black Sea bya single road, practicable for carriages at all times of the yeur except when closed by snow. From Erzeroum the direct route to Kars, running in a direction nearly E.N.E., is likewise practicable in summer for artillery. It is estimated at .36 hours (about 125 miles) under ordinary circumstances, and is divided into five stages by the stations.Hassan, Kaleh, Ardos, Yenikeui, and Chiplaklee, of which the first is six hours from Erzeroum, and the last nine from Kars. To thesouthof this road is the great comniercial route to Persia by Bayazid, separated from the fornier by the watershed which divides the head waters of the Euphrates from the streams which ultimately fall, through the Araxes and the Koura, into the Caspian sea. About half-way,between Erzeroum and Byaazid is the strong position of Toprak Kaleh, whence another road to the north-east crosses the Araxes at Kaghisman, and thence proceeds northwards over the range called Soghanli Dagh:-to Kars. . Again, to the nortiX of the Erzeroumn and Kars road is a third route leading through Olti to Ardahan, now the frontier town of Asiatic Turkey towards the northeast, but previously to the year 1829 connected by two routes with the important positions of Akhal1alik and Akhalzik (or Akhisa). Thus Erzeroum, Bayazid, aid Ardahan may be regarded as the three angles of a nearly equilateral triangle, of which the last-mentionedplace is the vertex; or, if the small Roxman "y" be imagined, laid down upon its thinner side, with the tail somew,hat - raised, the extremity of the latter will correspond nearly with the position of Trebizonde, its insertion into the body of the litter with Erzeroum, the re- aining two points with. Ardahan and Bayazid, and the sweep of the tail will approximately represent the circuitous route by which, owing to the niountainous character of the country, the communications of Armenia with the coast of the Euxine are niaintained. It was plain that, if the country was to be invaded by the Russians, the choice lay between Kars and Bayazid; for since the loss of Lhc pashalic of Akhalzik the roads between.that place and Ardahan had been allowed to fall into such a state as to render the alternative of the third route out of the question. The following despatches will show the means which General Williams had at his disposal for the defence of the positions just described, and the use which he made of them. On Mlay 19 MIaior Olpherts, who had been at Kars, was.directed to pass through Kaghisman to Toprak Kaleh, the latter being the point for which the commissioner, apprehending as he did an advance on the Byazid-road, most feared. He was to put himself into commuiiication. with Veli Pasha, the Lieutenant-General commanding the forces there, andto encourage himto firmness and vigilance. "-i the event of disaster," says Ger.eral'Wlliams, "H cwi1now have'fery formidable liiesto fall backupon, the forts commanding this city (Erzeroim) being ready to receive tbeir :heavy armaments - and MajorTee6dale is encamped tvc hours off. engaged in executing_the entrenchments which I have deemed it necessary to throw up at the pass from Hamsan Ealeh into this plain.. Vely Pasha has, thaerefore, not only fieldworks in his immediate front and rear, but also the great encouragement to resist stoutly, in knowing that a series of formidable entrenchments and worls, armed with siege artillery, are ready to receive him in the event of his being forced back on Erzeroum; while this power of resistance would enable detachments from Xars to operate in the enemy's rear, and force hi;n to abandon his enterprise against this depot of ammunition and provisions." In the: meantime Major Olpherts is to take all possible precaUtions against a repetition of such an affair as tnat of Kurruk-Derreh the year before; he isto instil-into the mind of Yeli Pasha the necessitof strengthening hispoBitions, of drling his halfdisciplined men, and also of abstaining from all provocation of the enemy which might lead to defeat -such as useless and vaunting reconnaissances. inut, it was not by the Byazid road- that the enemy had determined to make his attack. The following is the last- despatch which General Willlams wrote from trzeroum. It is dated the 29th of Mlay, and addiessed to Lord Clarendon:- " Since thad the honour to address your Lordship on the affairs of the amyof arsIhaveexertedeveryeffort to send forward provisions to its head-quarters, and to the detachanents at Toprak Kaleh. Afore than 4,000 mules and horses. have beemL despatched through my sole exertions, independent of,those in the Government employ, and, now that, the peasants have sown their corn and barley, the arabas of the country will be at the disposal of the Government. " I have also sent eight siege guns to Kars, to add to those now in position there. "I received last night a comnunication from Colonel lake, stating that a large Bussian force, consisting of 2S ,OO infantry. 7,500 ca4a, and 64Mieces of artillery, was asssembled roued' Gumnni, and thath 3 Mushir had receivedn!formation o-, the intention of the enemy to Attack Rars. We have in that entrenched camp 13,900 infant,' 1,5CO cav , 1,50 artilleymn, and 4Z geld pieces. "The 3ruTshir has,. therefore, aent for. the troops under 37ehmlet P.sha, at Moowsal, to come to Erzeroum, and has also directed Mustafs Pasha to quit Diarbekir and proceed to the same destination. His Excellency has also sent to Constantinople for troops. The Mushir acquiesced in my views respecting the Eamazan fast, and the garrison is consequently enabled to, labour in the fortifications, as well as to keep a ieilant look-out t night. "Al the rorts commanding Erreroumn being armed, they were inaugurated yesterday. Mehnied Pasha, the newly arrived Vali,atn request, sent ibout 3,000 armed Mlussu. man citize sinto' them during the ceremony, 'and I hope that, in the event-of an affack, these mien will render mateaii assistance to the slender detachnients' of regular troops now stationed in them. "`3jor Teedle is still encamped with the worlcmen at the pausses lea-din into this plain from that 'of Hasan' Kaleb, and after the depAure of the neixt poet I shall rejoin the Mo3hir at Kars, or at an earlier day if the enemy move from their cantonment around Guiri. I have also heard from Mjor Olpherts (27th inst^) at Toprak Kaleh. He was u1ng all his efforts to Aive . ipformation, and keep me in communication with YeiIPiiw and also repor the march'of RusiTan troops towards Gsieiit." On thq 2d of June General 'W ams left Erzeroim to proceed to Kars, the iateiided attack of wj,ich place had been announced by the Rusian commander T an order if theday. "If the Ruaans leave eorg to atfc K3ars," he writes to Lord .garwndo'n on thi3d ftopi the DWvboynou Pa - "It woeld shoir thAt'ux Spies an( tram-elerz have unserateod theiistrec,' o 'tb htey find no succour coming to isbitherfromTrebizodow Batoum.

As on th. 20th of April there were only 15 day' provisjopa jn Kars, os the e7th of May none hd anrve4 fri E netow, and the subequent xapply was due -nly to the docision of Geeral Willis, backed by Vazif Pahua, in putting himself at the head of the purchasing as welr as the transport departniest-a step wRhich the si could eearcely heave expectd. It seem.s reasonable to con- _ sa..r . ;ze rse 7 i,; leonsit. nf their, calculations was the supineness, not to say treachery, of the Turkish officials, and that their plans for the attack of Kars were too far matured to be changed upon obtaining intelligence (if they ever did so) of the alteration which had taken place during tho last fortnight of May. We now tumn to Constantinople, where General Williams's despatches of the 27th of Slay and the 3d of June seem to have impressed the British Ambassador very differently from his earlier communications. Here are- his instructions to M. Fisani of the 13th of June: " I learn from Brigadier-General Williams that the Russians appeared, when he wrote, to be meditating an attack on the army at Kars, and I fear we shall have to deplore the little or tardy attention paid to my earnest and repeated requisitions for supplies and reinforcements. Even now, at the eleventh hour, it is 3nost desirable that aU which it is in the power of the Government to do in these respects should be donewithout a moment's delay. According to my last advices from General Williams, money was greatly wanted, and he presses the demand most earnestly upon mne. See Fuad Pasha and the Seraskier withoult delay, and urge them to send off as large a sum as thley can possibly spare, while they are preparing wrhatever. may yet be forwfarded in point of men and supplies. The case does really seem to be very ulrgent. *I learn from our Cons^ul at Trebizond, that the Russias had made an attack on Chorukso, and been repulsed with loss after a sharp engagement. Has the Porte any news of this ? " Now that Circassia is cleared of the Russians; why should not the old idea of uniting the army at Batoum with that of Bars be acted upon in the present emergency? Suggest this impressively. I am assured that Batoum may be held with a very small force, snpposing it to have works sufficient to be relied on; but of ths I agm no judge." The case does really seem to bevery urgent ! Indeed it does. "T The Porte eceived similar intelligence a few days ago," which, however it came, seems not to have been thought worth commnunicating to the British Ambassador. However, the old enemy of the Commissioner, Riza Pasha, is no longer Seraskier, but anotherman,Mehemet Rushti, who has boen recently atpp,inted Ho IInot. only concurs with Lord Stratford" in his idea about the army of Batouin, but even proposed it in the Council, and it was because some strong objections were opposed that he did not think it right to insist. On the 19th the Seraskier expressed his decided opinion that a body of 10,000 men might be detached from Batoum without danger to that establishment, which wouldstill have 4,000 or 5,000 for its protection. It was proposed at the same time that- some vessels of war should be directed to cruise along the coast of Circassia. "Lord Stratford was requested to submitthis plan to Admiral Sir Edmund Lyons, under an impression that a joint operation, in concert with the French, would be desirable." Deluded Seraskier t At this very time Mustapha Pasha, the conmmander at Batoum, was writinc' to General Williams to informhim that he " had but 3,772 regular troops with him, and was pressed by the enemy." No wonder that even at the birth of the magnificent project of a relieving detachment, 10,000 strong, "the Turkish Ministers are under an impression that the position occupied by the army at Ears would not enable it to withstand a vigorous attack on the part of the Russians, and that if the enemy appears in force, Vassif Pasha will probably have to fall back upon Erzeroum." One is tempted to speculate upon the nature of the strong objections" to the Seraskier's proposition just mentioned. Vassif Pasha, however, did not differ in opinion very much from his superiors at home, as appears from General. Williams'sfirst despatch from Ears, of the 9th of June: "On the day afterI addressed yourlordshipfromDWv6boyonou, I recei*ed from Colonel lbake the confirmation oE the intention of theRussians to attack this place in great force. I also got a confidential message from the Mlushir proposing to abandon Xars and defend Erzeroum. I -in stantly wrote back to Colonel Lake to beg the Mushir to act with the utmost vigour, and pressed on and reached Kars the dav before yesterday, where I have used every endeavour to intil energy into the mina of the Musb'ir andI likewise abstained fromremonstrating with his Excellency on his strange proposition to abandon a place which we had been at such trouble to provision and fortify, thinling, as I do, that he feels the weight of the false step he was. about to take, and is wiling to act upon my suggestions. *With this imrapession, I have been occupied all day in stationing the :troops in the various batteries, in arming and suppling those batteries with ammunition, and in addressing to eachrgiment words of encouragement afid hope:- The enemy, m force about 30,000 men of all arms, accompanied by a train and vast supplies necessary for a siege, is ithin four hours of us, and w/lfl, most probably, attack us to-mnorrow. I have advisedthe Mushir to write to Mustaf Pasha, of Batown, for 0,000 zO be dIrmu,La wx Anai.vLn, d ao Veli IPasha, of Toprak-Kaleh, to prepare for an instant march when he shall have received orders for it. This is all I can do in our isolated and neglected state, and I am happy to say that our garris<: appears in good spirits, and promises me to do its duty." Ardaan, however, on which the Batoum force (had 'it been available) was to be directed, was mn the hands of the Russians at the- time the Comnmiioner was vwrting, as he learnt a few days afterwards. The Turkish detachment in the place, amounting only to 800 cavalry, had been withdrawn to Kars, and the Russians, after purchasing corn and destroying some intrenchments which the Turks had thrown up the year before, had returned to their camp at Zaim and Akche-Kala (villages about three hours from Ears) on the 13th of June. Their numbers appeared to the Commissioner a7iout 30,000 of all arms, and they were obviously nidcditating an attack on the fortress.' This at las took place on the 16th, but. not with the result anticipated by the Turkish Government. General Williams the next day writes to Lord Clarendon - " Our advanced posts were driven in soon after daylight, and the Russian army appeared on the height about halfpast 6 'clock; its advanced guard consisted of three regiments of Regular Cossacks, supported by artillery and rockets. The mnain body of infantry marched in three colum3ns, faked by three regimnents of Dragoons and supported by six batteries of eight gns each. In the rear ap. pearedastrong columniof reserve inFantry, then the waggons, carrying, as I have since heard, three days' yrovssion. The whole force.could net have been less than x00 "Nothing couldbe more perfect than the hiadlingof the enemy's army as it' advanced upon the frounof our is trenchments formed by the line of works caled Arsb Tabia, Kradagh, and Efiz Pasha Tabia, and facing the Gumri road.

Not feelini diosed to repeat the expi-ment of a direct attack uon the Turldsh lines,"the Russian Igeneral broke-up his camp at Zaim-and-Alkche-lala, and made a flankr march round their intrenchedw cap.

The melancholy news contaied- i athe two fodlwing di@patches roachod CosaUtiople about the 11th of JTuly, Omar Pasha (at Sobatepo on tie I5h, d Lod Cltreudon on the 18th IhaY require no oommawtay. The first is from C(noas Brant, at Eracroum, written on t;he 22d bf Jun; the second from the Comnuioner biraf s s, of a dayr later. In the blue-book their poiitioi is, without, any apparent reason, reversed I (No. 257.) "It were $aperfittous to detail events at Kars, as General Williams addressed a despatch to your Lordship of as late & date as a short note I received from him. "The despatch to your'Lordship I forwatded yesterday by a special messenger to the Porte, sent off hurriedly by the authorities to solicit immediate reinforcements. "The army of Kars is in a difficult position within its intrenchments, from which it cannot issue in face of a superior Russian force, including a large body of cavalry, which may be said to be entirely wanting in the Turkish army; for a few regular cavalry badly mounted, armed, and clothed, without any knowledge of drill, orany efflcient officers, can. not be taken into account. " There is at present at Kars no deficiency of provisions; but, if there be no possibility of introducing supplies, the garrison will ultimately be forced to surrender for want of food, if the Russians maintain their position. It were, therefore, necessary, in order to save Xars and its army, to send up reinforcements as rapidly as possible, and more particularly to supply the want of cavalry. The civil and military authorities have urged this on the Porte, and have begged me to request his Excellency the Viscount Stratford de Redlhffe to impress on the Sultan's Government the very critical position in which Kars and its army, as well as Erzeroum, wiUl be placed, by the slightest delay in complying with their demand. " lt was evident that while Riza Pasba occupied the post of Soraskier nothing could be expected; his neglect of this army ha3 been so marked that- everybody believes tnat he wished its destruction. Possibly one of the causes of this sup posed feelion may have been his desire to- save the credit of hisprotfg4, Zarif Mustafa Pasha, by showing that he was not so much to blame, since nobody could do better. But the advent to the Seraskierat of Mehemet RushtiPasha leads people to hope that effectual reinforcements will soon be sent; not a moment, however, must be lost or this ill-used army will either perish of hunei-, be vanquished by the discipline, efficiency, and numbers of the enemy, or be forced to capitulLate. "Everything that energz and sill can accomplish maybe expected from General Williams; bat it may be feared that his health-will fail him under the incessant fatigue he undergoes. "It is fortunate that the Musshir agrees to his saggestions on every Point, and that the Military Council is not now, asformerly, divided by intrigaes. -lt is also fortuate that the generals care- of the soldiers, his watchfulness and - energy, and -his calm and resolute bearing, have won the confidence oEfthe xrmy; and that he is admirably seconded lFy Iha foDriBntis4 officer, on hir ,aff. Still these advantages, great as they are, cannot counteract the scanty numbers of the force, its want of discipline and efficient officers, and the abvence of cavalry; so that thepreservation of this small, devoted army must depend more on its receiving reinforcemenits, than on its own conduct, however brilliant and self-devoted they may be. The Mushir has this moment informed me that, in consequence of the enemy having intercepted the direct communications vith Erzeroum, he should send off, in an hour, a courier by an indirect route. I must, therefore, in as few words as possible, detail the events which occurred since I informed your lordship, on the 19th inst., that the Russian army under! General Mouravieff had, by a flank march, established itself opposite our intrenched camp, at a distance of three miles. " The raiu' has been so heavy and incessant as to prevent the enemy from any attemnpt to attack our lines, but he has pushed forward la re odies of cavalry, supported by guns, burnt the surrourinng viUagesand destroyed one of our smill depts of grain at Chiplee, eight hours' on the Erzeroum ro*d, and, probably thinking that our intrench. ments are too formidable to. take by a coup de, nin, he has sent to Gumxi for eight heavy guns belonging to that fortress, vhirbh are now on their way to his camp. "The duties of our garrison have been most trying, in consequence'of the torrents of rain, but the spirit of the troois is good. - urgently recommend the immediate landing of troops at Trebizond, and, if the season will admit of it, strong demonstratigrns from Bedout-Kaleb." On the 28th of June despair of the defence of Kars still-prevails at Constantinople. Scanty intelligence arTives. It comes round by the Crimea from Lord!Raglan. The Russian force before Kars now is sai -to reach 36,000. All the Turkish troops between Ears and Erzeroum cannot be carried -beyond 20a00. The Seraslderprepares Lord Stratford " for a retrograde movement on their part, it being his decided opinion that the positions at Krs are not tehable against the enemy." His Lordship finds "some consolation" in the fact that,- " Everi at this 11th hour the necessity of listenin" to my adavce; and sending off reinforcementswithout further delay is recognized.- But where are these to be obtained? The Turkish Milisters, who had talked of sending 10,000 men from Bato;in to ErZerounm, now, in their embarrassment, incline to hnother plan. They propose to form an intrenched catnp at Redout-aleh, and- to concentratethere the corps of General Vivian-com pleted by a draught of 10,0fijsen from the Bulgarian army-that of General Beatson, aud the detachment from Batonum, reduced to 7,000men. The total of these combined forces would be about 30,00 of all arms Stationary they mightoperate as a diversion in- fa-vour of the army at Kars or lrzeroum advancing by Kutais on Georgia, they might either attack the Russfaris in the rear or force them to retreat. - "The main objections to this plan are the extreme insalubrity of the the Circassian coasts and valleys from now till October the incomplete organization of Beatson's Horse ar& tie Turkish Contingent; the difficulty of procuring suipp1ie r transportr and the danger of exposing a mixed lurkish force to collision with a well-appoin ed and nrumerus enemy in the open field." The deWpatch containing this information reached the Forein-office in London on the 9th of July, the fololling one on the 11th, dates which it is important to remember in judging of the conduct of the home' Government.- Ons the!30th of June a conference took place at the Grandl Vizier's house, at which the Seraskier, Lord Stratford, and General Mansfield were present. The information on which they proceeded was of the date of the 19th of June; bat they seem not to have been aware of the extent to which General Williams' had succeeded in victualing Kars, and to have believed there was only a month's supply. How this should have happened, if General Williamsis despatch to Lord Clarendon of the 2d of -June passed unceer flying seal through the hands of Lord Stritford, is not explained, and certainly deserves explanation. "It was:clear to all present that, whether the Russians besieged or turned Kars, the Turlish army required an effort to be made for its relief with all practicable despatch, and that of three possible modes of acting for that purpose the only onie likely-to prove effective vws an expedition by Kutais into Georgia. To send reinforcements by Trebizonde would be $tbest a palliative. To establish an intrenched camp at Redout-Xialeh would, at this unhealthy season, be equmvalent to consigning the troops to destruction. "The real question -was, whether a force numerically sufficient,andin all -respects effective,- could- be collected in [ time at Xutais to make an excursion into Georgia and threaten the communications of the Russian army, placing it indeed `betwe4n two hostile forces should the Turkish army stilPbe in a condition to take the field." The day after the conference, at which the inclinationl of the -Turkish Government for a diversion by way of Redout-Kaleh and Kutais had been clearly maniaested, an interview took place between ithe Seralder, Fuad Pasha, and Generals Viviau and Mansfield, npon the purely military considerations attending the nndertaking, the -conduct of which was offered to Generasl Vivian. - o "Fuadpashaat great length went over aJl the matters which hal been brought forward before his Excellency Lord. Stfatford de PRedeliffe the day before. He explained the situation of the army of Kars, and that it was proposed to relieve that arny by a powerful diversion, that this diversion could - be best made, indtad only. made, from Bedout-Kaleb, or some place in its vicinity, for the landing of troops and the establishment of a basis of operations; that troops so landing should be thrown in advance as quickly as possible on Kutais, and operate towards Teflis, where it is considered the veal objects of a war against Russia by the allies may be best obtained; that by such a grand operation the best chance for the Army of Kars is secured, whereas by any othei mnode means would be frittered away without result, either immediate or ultimate, to the good of -the cause; that if tbeproiect is not adopted from want of means, they :mus htvxrecourse to those measures inwhich they have no 6onfidence. - General Vivian replied that he should like to nowr-. What meane rwere disposable for so great a plan. "-ETiad Pafha answered that, in the first nlace, there vas jof the Contingent nor ready actually at Bujukdere 10,000 Thsattpart of the Contingent to be immediately eembledin~ Bulgaria-.. . .. ..1,000 To be drawn.in addition from the garrisons in Bul- - garia,. and attacEed to the British Contingent in camp- ,5 ) Beatsonis Horse . °°.

Lord Clarendon writes on the 13th of July , "Theplan proposed by the Porte for the relief of th8 Tarkish army at Kars, as sketched out in your F,xcellency's despAckhes of the 30th of June andlst inst., has been attentively onsideredby Her MajWests Government ; indl have toitate to yourExcellency that itappears to be objection, able for the followring reasons- - " It -would be in the greatest degree imprdent to;throw - on aan w6lesome co, without mean of land transport, rwIU out any certainty of provisions, without an assured communication with'the rear, without an accurate-knowledge of the country to be traversed,or the strenrth of the ,enemy^,to -bo,exicountered, andvwith theprobability of a bsitile population, 40,000 men, hurniedly-collected from -Iu quarters, imperfectly disciplined, doubtfully armen d and qquipped, and as yet unorgxnized-and to-expose them - apon.. to all-the hazardx aud difficulties -of a campaign agai a ,Ruasir iay, -Theywoq8d-falill betweeRe. tut-Kabi M X KutA,* n-ad, boe defea between Kuttei M Teflua2; M ver, i fragmnto be united for the wamy ar no cattered aboat, that Fe's,4f ito Wkeilalce, would be over long beee it oLd mdar-te-eei of *itow. -- "Dr Majesty' Governmentare of opifion *tht the wiser course would beto send rcinforcemenha to the rear of t,ho Turkih srnq,Jnstead_of swding au e±pedition to the rear of the Russian army. The reinforcementg'might go to Trebizonde, and bo direoted thence upon Ersrowu, The distance from Trebizondo to Erzeroum is less than from Itedout-Kaleh to Teflis, and the march is through a frienly, inad of throngh a hoetile country; and at Erzoroum the army would meet supporting friends, instead of opposing enemies, and supplies, instead of famine. " If the army at lEars ca.nnot maintain that position against the Russians, it should fal} back upon Erzeroum, aud the wrhole Turkish force should e concentrated there. If the Russians are to be defeated, it will be easier to defeat them by the whole force collected than by divided portions of that force; and a defeat would be the more decisive the further it took place within the Turkish frontier. " Trebizonde is a port where supples of all lkinds mnight be landed, and Her Majest s Government beleve `hat it is a healthy place, and that rzeroumnis so likewise. "Suc an arrangement as that which I have described would give time for collecting and organizing the various detached corps of which the proposed army of 40,000 men is to be comyosed; and er fajesty's Government entirely concur in Lieatenant-General Vivian's opinion, that an army thrown on a coast without means of transport and sunp plies is doomed to destruction." Lord Panmure, who writes to General Vivian on the next day, is even stronger in his language - " I entirely concur in all that is said in that despatch as to the objectionable character of the plan proposed by the Porte. " I place such 'ful reliance on your professional ability that Ifedl no anxiety lest you should undertakc any expedition of a nature so wild and ill-digested as that contem. plated by the Porte. " While it is your duty to give every aid in your powar not simply as commanding the Contingent, but as a Britisfh officer enjoying the confidence of Her Majestys Government, to our allies the Turks, it is at t'he same time necessary that you should be cautious in not risking the honour of the British'name and your ownL reputation by undertakin military operations for which proper bases have not been faid down, communications opened, supplies arranged, and transport provided. "A coup dc main by means of suddenly throwing an army on the coast to threaten, or even to attack an enemy's stronghold, is one thing; but a deliberate expcdition to 2nvade an enemy's country, and on his own territory to make war upon him, is quite another. "' In the first case, something may be hazarded; but, in the other, every preparation must precede action. "oreover, from all the information ;which has reached me I have every reason to believe the army of Batounm to be in a deplorable state. I knowr the Contingent to be scarcely organized; of the Bulgarian troops you. canl have no knowvledge, and I presume that Eeatson's Horse are as little reduced to control and discipline as your own troops. In short, I am assured that it would be madness to attempt to succour Brigadier-General-Williams in this way. If istoo late to regret the policy which has left that gallant officer and his army exposed to such straits; but it would only be opening the way to fresh failure to follow out such schemes as have been proposed for the purpose of reieving. him. You must, as I have no doubt you feel, lose no time in getting your force into order for senice, which will be sure to await you somewhere, as soon as you are ready for it; but organizat;on is as necessarY for an army as endurance and valour, and without the formor the latter qualities are utterly unavailing." Iu the meantime the proposed plan for relieving Xars is gaining popularity at Constantinople. The estimate formed by General Vivian as to the transport required put the original project out of the question; but General Mansfield brings forward something more feasible. This is on the 4th of July :_ "The plan drawn up by me for the consideration of his Excellency Viscount Stratford dc Redeliffe was then read -namely, to despatch the troops by detachments, to save transport, of vvhichthere is a deficiency, the first detachment consisting of about. 10,000 men. The men in the neighbourhood of Batoum, to the amount of 12,000, to be concentrated at BRedout-Kalek. "On the first detachment being landed, a forward movement of 292,000 men to he made immediately on Eutais; engineers being left at Redout-Ealeh to trace and estabish an intrenched camp, the labourers of the country being called in to assist their work. " The first detachment being landed, the ships to return and take up the remainder of the force as it could be got ready, and to land it by battalions at the camp. " I explained that the object of this was at once to render available for the relief of the army of Ears the resources and troops actually now ready, and not to interfere with the ultimate and larger objects of the expedition; that it was the opinion of 11cr Majesty's anibassador that the plan was feasible, but that it would be necessary to use the utmost diligence, both in throwing forward the force and in providing the supports, transport, and supplies. "'To all this the Seraskier agreed most joyfully. He said it was exactly his own idea, which he had two days before expressed at the Council of Ministers. It was the only chance for the army of Ears. There was a canal from 6oti to Redont-Kalsh, the entrance of which had been stopped Un by- the Russians when Redout-Kaleh was evacuated oy them. Poti, being out of range from the fire of shipping, is still held by them. He beheved there are two battalions there now. The concentration of the men at Redout-Kaleh would probably cause its evacuation; at all events, it must betaken. "I agreed to this. "The Seraskier quite understands that the first advance onEutais, as has been detailed, is not a substitute for the larger plan. " There are 50 guns of different calibrcs for aiego opetions at Batoum of five, seven, and nine okes respectively, five okes being taken as the equtivalent of 12 pounds. "20 heavy guns will bh immediately put in a state of readiness at the arsenal at Pera for the service of a siege. " Plenty of boats can be procured at Batoum and Trebizonde for conveyance of stores and guns on the river Rhion whenKPoti has been taken. It is only a question of paying the boatmen; there will be no difficulty in that respect. " I then informed his Excellency that Her Majestys Ambassador had communicated with the British Government on the subject, and that it would be necessary to do the same in due time with the allied commanders." General Mansfield is not aware, nor is the Divan, I or the 'British Ambassador, that 12,000 is three times as much as the whole force at Batoumn; an(d on the 12th of July Lord Stratford sends a telegraphic message to the Foreign-office - I -Preparations for an eventual expedition, as explained in my despatches of the 30th ult. and 1st aild 5th inst., are in progress. It might save much valuable time if you would inform me at once by telegraph whether Government is prepared to sanction a powerful diver ionby Redout-Ealeh and Kutais, into Georgia, if local investigation and the engagements of the Turldsh and alied authorites as to the means of execution should warrant a calculation of success." An answer in the negative was telegraphed baek, accompanied by an instruction that Trebizonde ought to be the base of operations, and, in the event of the necessity occurring, the armies of Ears and EBrserotum should fall back on that place, where they might be easily reinforced. WVhile these plans are being agitated at Constantinople Mouravieff pursues the advantage which his superiority in cavalry gives him. General Williams writes on the 27th of June:- "The Russian army, being master of the surrounding country;, plunders it daily, and supplies itself with fuel by unroofing the houses of the Mussulman villages, but spares those inhabited bytheArmenians. "I regret- to inform your Lordship that the mail bags brought to Erzeroum by the English tatar from Constantinoplo, aud.forwarded by the Consul, fell into the enemy's hauids, so Wd are ignorant of whiat has recently tak.in place in E:urope or the Crimea. General Mouravieffpolitely sent back all such private letters as were barren of public or political news." On the 28th,- "The Russian army quitted its camp before Kars this morning at daylight, andhbaa marched three hours to the south-east, nore effectually, I presume, to interrapt our communication with Erzeroum. The command .of land transport enjoyed by the enemy is enormous, and their convoys are admirably arranged. Our garrison, on the'contrary, has no funds to procure arabas or country carts, even supposing that the surrounding country possessed them; we must therefore hold this place till the last moment, while the enemy is master of all without the reach of our guns; moreover, the troops, who have conducted themselves so well since General Mouravieff appeared before Ears, are 23, 27, anni 2S montls in arrearof£ pay. " Tho Mifshir has just received a dexpatch by his aide-decamp, Feky Bey, 'from Mehemet Palha, the newly-appointed Seraskier, to theeffect-that no assdstnce could bs expected fron Constantinople, but that he would write_to,- ustafa Pasha, of Batoum, to send us up 5,000 men, whereas that General has recently wvritten to me to say that he had only 3,772 regular troops, and was pressed by the enemy. IYhe Seraskier further promcise3 fto send l5,000 purses and 0 artierymen from the Dardanelles, and two battalions of infantry and four squadrons of cavalry.are the only troopswhichhe can spare from Diarbelir and Aleppo. "To thiS state, has. the apathy and, indifference of the authorities ,a, the capital reduced its Asiatic provinces." On the Zththings look even- worie. The ma 1azine at Ye6ikeui is menaced.--' " The enemy yesterday detached a laige.force, consisting of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, towards the pass leading to Yenikeui, where we have magazines of wheat and barley. The true object of this- ovement eannotyet beascertained; butthe Mushir, has written to Vely Pasha, who is now encamped at Eupri:Eoui -and covers-.Erzeroum; to.be on -his guard, and in - tho event of th'advance of 'the'enemy in force, to retire 'to the first Erzeroum intrenchmenta of UDv6boyonoun, and thence into the redoubta whifhi comman& that ci,ty. -Tahir :-Pasha, who-recently cane-here to assist in the defence of Hars, goes off to-nightto Erzeroum, where his experience inthe ma4isgement of artiUery and his knowledge of English will be of great value.

"The position occupied by Vely Pasha at Xupri Eeui and the fortifications recently constructed at Erzeroum, no doubt,prevented the Russian General from hazarding an attack m that direction, for his numerous and exceHlent cavalry and overpowering field artillery (80 guns) render lim master of everything out of thezeach of our cxnnon. " Yesterday the enemy returned to the camp before Kars, audhis reunited forces are ready either to assault or to more closely invest us, by cutting off our only remsining eommuzication with Erzeroun vi Olti." As a set-off to these misfortumes, there is a prospect of some irregular troops from Trebizonde "His Excellency Hafiz Pasha of Trebizond large force of Bashi-Bazouks. e rom the haste ithwch they are collected and the clsses wrhich are to contribute to swell up the number I shoald think the real efflcencyof the reinforcement will be smaL Better to have 10,000 European soldiera than such hordes of undisciplined "If 10,000 good troops werequicly landed atTrebizone and brought up here by rapid marches, easng the men b loadin" the knapsacks and other traps on horses, tey oold amive lere oasily in ten days from T'ebizonde- such a f would suffice for defence, and other reinforcements could follow more leisurely." Hafiz Pasha dad actually leave Trebizonde for Erzeroum with 300 artillerymen on the 8th of July. The city is likewise covered by Vely Pasha, 'who, with Major Olpherts,when Kars was attacked, withdrew from his advanced position at Euch-Kilissa, beyond Toprak-Kaleh, and took Up one at EupriKeui, 25 miles from Ererou The projected relieving expedition to Kutais received a new impulse and a new form 'from the Crimea. General Wiliams's despatch of the 23d of Jut'ne, despatched, according to his instructions, in duplicate to Lord Raglan, fotmd that nobleman no longer alive, but General Simpson in command of an army dispirited by the failure of the, attack of the 18th of June. General Sinps.on communicated the unwelcome news to OmarPalia, who immediately proposed a conference to the Generals and Admirals commanding the'French and English forces in the Crimea, to take into consideration the expediency of his proceeding, with the force- he brought with him, from Eupatoria to Asia, in order to make a diversion in favour of Kars. This was on the 11th of July. On the 15th Colonel Simmons, the British Commissioner with him, wites the following extremely important despatch to Lord Clarendon, whichwas received in London on the 30th - "The Generals having signified -to Oitar Pasha that, in the absence of further information, they considered a conference would be premature, his Highness havinginthe meantime received des?atches upon the subject from his Government,* wrote again, pointing out tothe Generals the urgency of the subject, and called for a conference, which took lace yesterday at General Pelissier's head-quarters. fBy Omar Pasha's desire, I was present. The conference was attended by General Pelissier, General Simpson, Omar Pasha, General Della Marmora, General 3artimprey, Admirals Lyons, Brnat, and Sterrt. " Omarlasha explained to the conference the information he had receiiedfrom his Government relative to the Russian forces in Asia. " It appeas that. their total force of regular troops is 80,000 men, of whom a large portion are cavalry. "They have advanced from Gumri upon Kar -with a force e:ceeding 4S,OOO men, of whom 10,000 are cavalry, the remainder having taken the route by Byazid and ToprakKleb, wfhich, leaving Ears on their right, will lead them direct upon Erzeroum. "The Turlish forces to oppose this forwafd movement of the Russians are posted as followvs:- Infantry. Caalry. Guns. In l .. .. 17,000 80a 72 Ardahan.. .80 - Toprak-Ralch 5,750 - E:zeroum 1,850 - 21 Total . .. 24600 1,60 96 "The cavalry having been driven in from Ardahan is all united in Kars, and the troops from Toprak-Kaileh Will probably have fallen back upon Erzeroum, bringing up its garrison to 7,600, a force totally inadequate for its defence, especially when its position and extent are considered. " It will be quite competent to the Russians therefore to observe Kars, and with their superior cavalry prevent provisions from being taken into it, and, waiting its surrender, from want of provisions, to move upon Erzeronm. "Omar Pasha considers this position of affairs of the utmnost impaortance. " cHisHighness is of opinion that no time is to be lost in preparig a movement which shall check the progress of the Russians in Asia. " For the reasons assignedinaletter,datedthel2th inst., which, by his desire. Iaddressed to SirE. Lyons and General Simpson, his Highness considers that his army is the only one, and he is the only Turkish General, who can suCcessfuly oppose the Russians in Asia. At the same time, as he stated at the conference, if a decisive operation were In contemplation, for the execution of which the presence of his army was necessary, and which would have for its object the capture of Sebastopol, he should consider himseif bound to remain, as, Sebastopol taken, the affairs of Asia become of comnparatively triffing importance. If, on the contrary, no plan likely to load to a dooisivoresult has been decided upon, and the fate of Sebastopol should not be settledthissummer, the position of the Russiansin Asia becomes of the last importance, and might eventually decide the fate of SebastopoL "These beingthe opinions of his Highness, he impressed upon the conference the necessity of the move he had proposed. " The Generals, however, and Admirals, having received no information from their respective Ambassadors at Constantinople which should lead them to believe that the affairs of Asia were in that precarious state in -which Omar Pasha, from the information he had received from his Government, believed them to be, decided that in the absence of such information they could give no opinion upon the subject. "Sis Highness, under these circumstances, informed the conference that his Government having called upon him in such urgent terms to propose and carry, if possible, inta execution some project for saving them and thecountry from the great danger with which it is menaced, he felt it his duty to proceed to Constantinople for a few days to confer with his-Government uponthe subject. " He accordingly proceeds to-morrow in Her Miajesty's ship Valorous, which Sir E. Iyons, at his request, kindly -placed at his dspaL " I have to report that it is my intention to accompany * The nature of the communication from Constantinople is apparent from the following letter, demanding a conference for the second time "Head-quarters at the Trenches of the Naval - Brigade, July 12, 1855. ''Excellency,-I have had the honour to receive the letter addressed to me by your Excellency and the Commander-in-Chief of the hnglish army. " I hasten to inform you that yesterday, after I had addressed to yoar Excellency the note of the llth of July, I received from my Government a despatch informing me that the whole of Turkey in Asia, up to the gates of Constantinople itself, is undefended, and entreating me, as every hour is of the greatest value, 'immediately to find the meaus and to put into execution the measures necessary to avert the great danger in which the Government of Turkey and, in consequenoe, the cause of the allies are placed. "Under these circumstances, since I have in the Crimea 60,000 Turks, of whom the greater part are Asiatics, and whose families and property are exposed to the ravages of the enemy, and since I find that that army is inactive in the Crimea, without any prospect of immediate service that I cmn discover, I consider it my duty to my Sovereign and the common cause to renew to you the proposa which I made in my note of the 11th of July. "As the matter is represented to me by my Government as one of the greatest urgency, I Tropose to proceed tomorrow at 4 eoclock p.m. to the English he__-quaters, where I beg you to meet me in conference."

Scotlhnd-yard.- The escapa of the prisoner-seems to be unparalleled and beyond all previousprison-breaidng;. It appears that. the twG prisoners had been some time incarcerated in the gaor-one being sentencedto 14years' transportation, and the other to 10 years.- They were two daring characters, aud one was a relativo.of the notorious Xackett. who escapedfromthe same place several years since.

An alarm was raised, and on subsequent search being de by the govemor and officers, it seems tlat the prisoners, after.opening the door of the cel, walked along the passge, where they found an iron trapdoor, weighing three hundred weight, which they must have forced up,and got upon the roof of alow -building, Thence they scaled a.lofty wall by the aid of a ladder made of waxenws,which broughtthem tothe roof of the prison,-wkere they 3nusthlave encountered several difficuties, for thev descendedc and ascended at lesAL six -times: bef6re they could have reached,the outside of the gaol. -The ladder was found4 hangiDg upon the lofty a1 of the -exteriorpartof the6 prison, andLinuat have takcentherox vcta .&;long period to constrct. ,. .O.ue of the prisoners a, a shoemaker, and ihes other a bricklayer.

I NIL LA YABD IN ABERDEE. Mr.I1yard was entertained to a breakfast by the studentg of Mariscbal College and University, Aberdeen, in the County Etooms on Thursday morning. The attendanc&comprised also many ladies and gentlemen. Mr. R. Stephen, |tudent of divinity, occupied the chair. Mr. LAYAuD, who was warmly received, said,-A short time ago he read a recent popular history, which gave a somewhat unfavourable account of the imnabitants of the north of Scotland-when the thougtht occurred that he might have to exercise some discipline. (A laugh.) But if the Highlanders-and he believed they were represented there-were formerlv such as described lby MIr. Macaulay, certainy they were very much reformed. (Laughter.) He (Mr. Layard) did not agree with Mr. Macaulay, and he dii not think, speaking from facts he had seen, the Highlanders of Scotland deserved the character that historian gave them. When a young man, he (Mr. Layard) had a wish to soe the world, especially that kind of life which prevailed among the IHighlanders, and he had spent two yeers among tribes, the habits of which were, he presumed, very much those of the Highlanders of Scotland-tribes which had a greater liking for their neighbour's sheep than their orn, and would cross the border to carry off that neigh. bour's cattle. Such proceedings appeared very doubtful, no doubt, to us, with our modern habits, but they mnst remember that they were loolced upon in a very different light by those people-even as a fair warfare and the performance of an honourable duty-and he mnst say, that he had ever found that generosity, warm hospitality, and other virtues distinguished such tribes (cheers). -and to say that those ancient Highlanders vere actuated only by sordid motives and petty strifes-those men who showed such attachment to their chief, whom they !ooked up to as their prince, and for whom they -were ever ready to sacrifice their lives-who were so imbued with aspirit.of loyalty-was to tellthem what no man inhis senses would believe. (Cheers.) Having no judicial duties to perform as rector, he (Mr. Layard) began to think whether he could not,be of some other uso to the college with which he was connected, as he considered no man had a right to assume a position and perform no duties. He would not detain them at that moment with the subject of the union of the Universit'es, but would merely say, that this question was one afiecting not merely that college and King's College, but affecting th6 education of the north of Scotland. (Cheers.) He did think, as the Chairman had said, that it was the duty of all to pull together, in order to bringthis question to a satisfactory conclusion. It was 3o intimately connected with education in Scotland that he was every day more and more convinced of the necessitv of bringing it to an issue. They (Marischal College) had nobly borne their part, and the straggle should be continued till the arrangements were such as that the students of Marischal College would be enabled to compete for every office that Government might throw open to public competition. The Lord-Advocate, Lord Aberdeen, and other members of Parliament-all agreed with him (Mr. Layard) in wishing to bring this question to a satisfactory issue (applause), and nothing should be -anting on his part to that end; and, when the time came for hibm to resign his present office, he hope-d he should beable to say not that he had effected this, but that he had borne a humble part in bringing this question to a conclusion. (Great cheering.) Since he last addressed them questions of great public importance had been discussed. After a struggle, scarcely equalled in intensity in the annals of war, Sebastopol hd fallen (loud applause) and there vms every probability that by the end of the month we should have a treaty of peace signed. Very few public men desired war, and peace in the abstract was certainly more to be wished for. But he (Mr. Layard) had no confidence that the present peace would be, on the whole, a satisfactory one; and there was scarce a man to be found,fromtheLand's-endtoJohnO'Groat'shouse,batwould like another yeair of war. The reason wvas that, looking upon thequestion ina political light, itsaspect was not such as would warrant a lasting peace; and, secondly, there wasa general impression-and ,hat was no small matterthat Britain would be better entitled to the position she asumed in the world if we had another year's war, to show that there 'was that in En'lishmen which conquered every difficulty. With regar4to the generil question, he thought we left things pretty much m the same state as when we began. It was true ave had protected Turkey, and kept baclc Russia to a certain degree. Rulssia might rejoice to put an end to her action in the Black; Sea, and so far Turkey would be protected on that side. But so far as the great question of religious and political liberty 'as concerned, it reinainedpretty much the same as wihen We began. It had alwvays appeared to him that these great points should have been taken into serious considerat'on, so that, whne the war was brought to a conclusion, the Government would have been able to justify it by pointing to something havigheen done with regard to those great objects as to which he feared that before many years lapsed we should have to Ro to war again. With regard 'to Turkrey, something- had ben done for her protection, and he hoped she would make some progress in civilization. The Sultan himself was an excellent character-^exceedingly amiable; he had done alin hisipowerto promot the cause of civilization and religious liberty in his country. It was very tine the Government of Turkey was not so good nor so honest as it might be. But 'we must malke a distinctiou between a Government and a people, and his exLperience led him to think that in Tarkey they were much the same as here-there are men who make a point to take care of "Dowb." (Laughter.) He believed, however, thata more honest, amiable, and quiet people than the Turks did not exist, and he doubted not many of them had been exceedingly touchedby tlheir admirable conduct during the terrible siege of Ears (cheers), as recorded by Dr. Sandwith. Such men wres entitled to sympathy, and contributed to take from their nation that reproach which their Government brought upon it. The hon. gentleman then entered into somne particulars of tEe siege of Kars. Ee hoped the advantages which Turkey would enjoy from this war would enable itto reform its institutions and develope its resources, and. in that view, something would have been gained at least by the war. His second objection to peace was, that he did not think the country was lik-ely to leave 'ff in such a creditable way as it might. Having been present during the first threee months of the siege of Sebastopol, he saw during that time enough to convince him thatthe system of managing affairs was bad, and that altogether there was a laxity in our military system which vould lead to disaster and saffering. On his return to England,he hesitated not t utterhis opinion on this subject freely-whether he was justHied in doing so he left them to judge. (Cheers.) He might have made mistakesput the saddle on the WrOng horse, but great allownauca mulst be made for the excitement onefelt after returning from those wsenes which he had witnessed in the Crimea. (Cheers.) He vished to act an honest andindependent part -to call attention to the true state of matters in the Crimea, to have the guilty brought to justice. to see that no man should be protected by the influence of those in power. If he had erred, it was because he had not acted the part, as some 'would say, of " a discreet man." (Cheers:) Discretion was all very excellent, but indiscretion often meant merely saying what another did not think right; and he had nothing to gain, but everything to lose by the course he had pursued. In the Crimea he found that the regimental officers and the men-those on whom most rested the duty of maintaijirng the glory of }ngland-had not met with the support vwhich those had received to -whrom our misfortunes were to be attributed, and who had merely the inflnealce of power to protect them. He wished to have this evil correcced. The regimental officers had no influence, they were not looked well upon at the Horse Guards; and until very lately no officer lower in rank than a captain could receive any mark of distinction-a state of things which was contrary to the genius of a free country. In the House of Commons, the military men who had thriven by this system defended it, and bitterly attacked those who said a word against it; but this was not to be woudered at, as they owed their position to it. And if that system were changed and position could be gained by an educational test, he would like to know where they would be. (Cheers.) It was only the other night that one of them took a whole Tear to ansv-er a speech of his (Mr. Layard's and he then read most of it from a manuscript in such bad grammar and bad English as he should be sorry to see any stedent of Amirischal College exbibit. All the good that might be done had not been done, but the country wa5 thoroughly alive to the rottenness of the system, and he trusted some chage would be effected. Alluding to thme failure of the attack on the' ledasa, Mfr.. I.ayardsaid5whereverthe blame]lay, the regimental ofllcers and men had nobly done their duty, andthese wrere the very menwlhom'he wished to see rewarded. But for the gallantry displayed at the Redan the Government had refusd to award any distinction-a proceeding hich was calculated to discoure our troops wrhen similar devotion was nceded. Mr. Laynrd next alluded to regimental surgeons, highly eulogizing their services. There had been no nobler 3cident in the history of the campaign than the 'devotion displayedbyDr. Thomson in taking charge of the Russian wounded after the battle of the Alma; but even had that noble hero survived and not fallen a sacrifice to his sense of duty, he could not have been rewarded as others had been. Those -who souht this change might be liablo totmisrepre- sentation, and the discussion of the subject might give rise to angry feelings; yet, just as the ocean waspurified by the storm that wrecked many a noble vessel, so it required such storms to bring about a healthy atmosphere in the political world, And he trusted that this storm would have the effect of producing a healthy action in the management of every branch of the public service. (Cheers.) Tho hon. gentlemnanconcluLded byrepeatingthat he w" actuated by no other moive than a desire to do his duty honestly, and that, while they reformed their public institutions, lie trusted they wrould also reform their private institutions, so to speak-fiz., the Universities, and he hoped when the time cme for him to retire from his office, he should be able to point to something which would jstify the studentg in havmggone.out of their course to slect hin, who was a perfect stranger to them and whose claims wWere solely due to fortuitous circunstancesin the political zndliterary world.

POLAND. TO THE EDlTOR OF TEE TI[ES. Sir,-Poland appears to be ever the subject of your involuntary homage and willing hostility. You are eloquent in her praise and crown her with garlands, but only as a victim adorned for the sacrifice; and you pronounce her defunct, and bound over her grave with a suspicious alacrity. " If," you exclaim in your yesterday's article on the subject, "there were any reasonable probability of restoring this famous country to her ancient privileges and her anciont du4oti, -who woulc not rjoice at such a conclusion?' Then, after sketching a powerfal summary of the benefits which would, or might be, derived from the reconstitution of that famous Power, you proceed to censure the objects of the deputation which had an interview with Lord Palmerston on Saturday last, for the purpose of pressing upon his notice the claims of Poland to a just consideration in the present arrangements for peace in Europe, and you found your censure upon the allegation that her reconstruction is impossible, the great crime of her destruction having been consummated. The system of organized murder that has prevailed in Poland for upwards of a quarter of a century has, according to your version. of what truth compels you to say, done its work; andPoland, if thereby "be meant acountry inhabited by Poles, with the old feelings in their hearts and the old ideas in theirheads, hasceased tobe"' the present Poland is one "constituted by Russia for her own purposes." I wilnot stay to argue the morality of this reasoning, which would dissuade us from caling the murderer to account because his crime is consummated; for it seems, unhappily, a mode of reasoning in fash3ion at present; even Christian philanthropists appear to find it consistent with their sentiments and principles to advocate peace at any price, and, however its existence may be accompanied with theviolation of every dictate of justice and humanity, the solitudinem facivut, pacem appelane' system has lost its horrors. But I dispate the correctness of your facts and conclusions, and appeal for their contradiction to what has notoriously occurred in the course of the war. If the Poles of the present day have lost all their old feelings and ideas-if the nobles of the old school inhabit Poland no more, and the generation of hardy countrymen who rallied round the defenders of Warsaw, and met and conquered the Russians in 1830 and 1831, have passed away, how comes it. that all the Poles taken prisoners by the allied troops have eagerly prayed to be enrolied in their ranks or enabled in sonle shape to take part in the war against Russia ? How comes it that overtures were made by Poles serving under the Russians in the Crimea to join the British army ? How comes it that the iormation of a Polish Legion, under the name of " Cossacks of the Sultan," has been so easily accomplishedcl-and that, too, although the name was so objectionable that many of the Poles declined to serve Tunder it, or under any. other name or standard than their own; and Count Zamoyski, in accepting the command, reluctantly did so, and upon the principle of getting, not what he wished, but only what he could from the hesitating andmistaken policy of the alies. How comes it, if the old heart of Poland be so crushed out of her, as you would have us believe-how comes it that the Polish towns even now, according to your own account, " swarm with Russian soldiery and bristle with Russian cannon 7" How comes it that during the whole of the war alarge part of the very flower of the Russian army was obliged to be kept in the neighbourhood of Warsaw ? How comes it, finally, to use your own language as written a few months back, that " Siberia, instead of supplying hordes, is a drain upon Russia, and the Polish provinces must always lockup a great part of her army I" I must leave you, Sir, to reconcile the answers to these questions with your allegations as to the extinction of the national spirit in Poland, and as to its present population caring little and knowingnothing about the former position of their country; nor do my limits admit of any discussion of the question whether Austria, who has so often before expressed her deep shame at having had any share in the infamous participation of - Poland and her willingness to disgorge her portion of thespoil, would or not now be willing to do so. But I venture to declare my conviction that, had the allies openly and honestly pronounced the name of Poland, and unfurled her standard, they would have found no lack of devoted Polish hearts eager to forgive past neglect and rally round that banner, and they would have inflicted a more deadly and crushing blow upon the power of PRussia than they have been enabled to do by all their costly sacrifices of life and money in the Crimea; that themere aght attempt which.as been lately made to infuse the Polislh element into the struggle, and the prospect and dread of an approaching campaign on the Baltic and in Poland, have mainly led to Russia's anxiety for peace and her willinoness to accept the terms proposed by the allies; and that little else than disappointment can result from a pace which terminates the late gigantic struggle by leavin" Poland, Hungary, and Italy in their present position, and the continuance of large standing armies to keep them in bondage a State necessitv.

The former, having coaled, sailed on Saturday for Pembroke. The steam gunboat Ant, No. 40, with all her machinery complete, was launched from No. 4 slip in the Devonport dockyard on Saturday afternoon, in the presence of PortAdmiral Sir William Parker, and the principal officers of the Arsenal. The St. George, 120, Captain Harry Eyres, C.B., was towed on Saturday by the Zephyr and Conf5ance from Plymouth Sournd into Hamoaze. Her crew will be paid down and sent on board those ships which are deficient of hands. Captain Eyrestakes command of the screwsteamship Exmouth, 91, and it is probable that many of his officers will join her with him. The screw steamship James Watt, 91, Captain George Elliot, is appointed to leave Hamoaze to-morrow, Tuesday, for Plymouth Sound. The transport Diligence, from Pembroke, arrived on Saturday in Plymouth Sound, and was towed into Hamoaze by the steamvessel Zephyr. Tenders for supplying 3,000 quarters of wheat to the Royal William VictuaDling-yard, at Plymouth, are advertised to be received on Weednesday. Mr. Roberts, late Assistant-Master Attendant at Haulbowline, will shortly enter on the duties of Master Attendant at this establishment, in succession to Mr. James W. Armstrong. The Mohawk screw despatch steamer, Commander F. A. Close, has been detained at Chatham, in consequence of some defects which had tobe made good before she tookher departure for Sheerness. The Surprise gun vessel; Commander Harcourt Vernon, is ordered to be fitted for sea at Chatham to join the squadron of gunboats. The Cormorant, Commander Bowden, is expected to arrive at Chatham this day, to be made ready for sea. In accordance with the nevw regulations, MIr.

The whole of the depOt of the 91st (Argyllsliirel Regiment, numbering nearly 500 men of all ranks, assembled on the parade ground at Chathami barrac?ks on Friday to witness the presentation of medals to the non-commissioned officers and men belonging to that corps, who were engagged in the Caffre war. The distribution of the medals was made by Lieutenant-Colonel B. E. hL Gordon, wlho is in command of the depbt; each man, on his name being called, advancing to the front and receiving his medal. Colonel Gordon briefly addressed the men, and adverted to the Caffre war, in which trying campaign the whole of the troops engaged badso signally distinguished themslves, notwithstanding that they had to contend with a subtle enemy and a new kind of warfare. He also alluded in eulogistic terms to the vafour and endurance ofthe British soldier under such trying circumstances and in an enemy's country. The galant colonel having finished his address, such men as had received the Caffbe medal were marched back to their quarters from the parade-ground, the band playing the old Scotch air, "The Campbells are coming." The interesting ceremony was witnessed by a large number of offlcers belonging to the garrison. The largest number of invalids from the Crimea who have been received at Chatham for some time arrived by special train at Strood on Saturday afternoon last, consisting of men from nearly every regiment now serving in the East. They arrived at Portsmouth from the hospitals at Balaldava and Scutari in the Andes, No. 100, steam transport, which port they reached on the 15th inst., in chargo of Captain G. Browne, 95th Regiment. The Andes brought home 120 invalids, some of whom left the vessel at Portsmouth, and 84 were forwarded by railway to Chatham, in medical charge of Second-Class Surgeon 0. S. Donnall. The following officers who have been invalided home also arrived in the Andes :-Lieutenant A. G. Mf. Moore, 7th Dragoon Guards; Captain R. Baillie, 44th Regiment; Captain W. R. WiDliamson, 4Sth Regiment; and lieutenant W. G. D. Massy (" Redan Ieassy"), 19th Regiment. The Andes encountered strong head windsl4during her voyage from Gibraltar, and was also short of coals. On the arrival of the invalids at Strood, they were assisted to the ambulance waggon and the spring vans by a fatigue party from the barracks, and, after the usual medical examination had been made, those requiring surgical treatment were taken into the supplemental hospital at Brompton barracks, and the remainder sent to the Invalid dept at St. Marys, to await their discharge. Six insane men, who arrived with the invalids, weretaken tothe lunatic hDspital at Fort Pitt. Colonel Henry Jervis, commanding the provisional battalion at Chatham, on Saturday afternoon inspected the whole of the men belonging to the depOts of the 12th Regiment and 26th Cameronians, under orders for embarcation the former for Australia, and the latter to join the head-quarters of their regiment at Bermuda. An order has arrived at Chatham from the War-office, directing that the six-company depGt of the 91st Regimen' are to be held in readiness to move to the camp at Aldershott. It is expected that the depGt will leave Chatham barracks on the 15th of ApriL A detachment of non-commissioned officers belonging to the Royal Marines light infantry left Chatham on Saturday afternoon, and proceeded by railway to Woolwich to await orders for embarcation. A detachment of the 26th Cameronians, consisting of one rergeant, one drummer, and 13 privates, have arrived at Chatham Barracks from Tilbury-fort, where they were relieved by a detachment from the depot of the 40th Regiment. Twenty-four invalids belonging to the dep6t of the 22d Regiment arrived at Chatham on Friday afternoon, and were taken into the general hospital at Fort Pitt. * The screwtransport Bacehante, No.12, havingtakenin the greatest portion of her freight at Deptford, consisting of naval stores for the East, yesterday received orders to pro cced toWoolwich, to fill up with l31 tons of war materials. Having taken up her moorings off the Royal Arsenal, she received a counter order per telegraph to get up steam and return to Deptford. This and other circumstances lead to the conclusion that a peaceful termination to present hostilities in the Crimea is not far distant. For some days past the proof guns and mortars at Woolwich have bean fired by means of the galvanic process, which was introdueed experimentally some time back. The discharge of the various pieces in succession takes place regularly, and with much greater rapidity and precision than by the former system. That portion of the invalids disembarked from on board the Great Tasmania at Portsmouth, and which belong to Woolwich,-namel, S0 privates of the Royal Artillery, ar- rived thereon Saturday bytrain, and having been medically tested were admitted to quarters. Detachments of Marines were on Saturday ordered to hold themselves iu readiness in sufficient numbers for the supply of eight gunboats, to arrive at Woolwich on Monday. The gunboats Roebuck, Spanker, Thrasher, Leveret, and Mackerel were expected to arrive at Woolwich on Saturday from the builders, to be rigged and fitted out. The repairs and alterations of the Kite are now completed, and she is again in perfect sea order. The Roebuck, a new class of gun'boat, intended for great speed, was launched on Saturday, at 3 p.an., from the build. ingyardof MIessrs. John Scott Russel and Company, at 4ilwall. She was immediately taken down to Woolwicli, where she will receive her nachinery. The ceremony of launching was performed by Miss Austin, in the presence of Captain-Superintendent Austin and other naval authorities of Deptford dockyard. The Roebuck is a vessel of 851 tons and 350 horse-power, and the following are her principal dimensions :-Length between perpendiculars, 200ft.;e ditto of keel for tonnage, 179ft. 9in.; breadth, extreme S0ft. 2in.; ditto for tonnage, 29ft. 10in. ; ditto, moulded, 29ft. 4in.; depth in hold, 14ft. 6in.; builders' tonnage, 851 10-94.- The Wanderer, 4, new screw steam gunboat of 200-horse power (nominal), Commander John B. Luce, completed her coaling alongside the floating depOt in Saltpan-reach on Saturday last, and left Sheerness for the eist coast of England, vith orders permitting her to visit the Scotch ports. Commander Alan H. Gardner, of the Driver, 0, paddlewheel steamnsloop, left Sheerness on Saturday last in the Wildfire steam-tender to the Waterloo, for Woolwich, to proceed to nick quarters, On his leaving all the offlicers and ship'a company assembled on deck, and expressed their hearty good wishes for his early reCovery and return again to his command. -On the Wildfire casting off from alongside theDlriver the whole harbour echoed with their cheers, which were continued until the Wildfire rounded the Garrison Point. Commander Gardner has thoroughly endeared himself to his officers and men, and may boast of as smart a ship's comupany and officers as the service can produce. The Driver has received nine montls' provisions, stores, &c., and is now under sailing orders, waiting Admiralty instractions for her destination. The Horatio, 8, screw steamship, Captain the Hon. Arthur A. Cochrane, C.B., has had a very satisfactory trial of her machinery. Her officers are drawing stores for their respective classes, and she, with the Driver, remains under sailing orders. In consequene of some slight defects and derangements of the machinery of the floating batteries Thunder, Captain George G. Randolph, and the Trusty, Captain Frederck A. Campbell, on the last trial of their engines, they will not be ready to leave Sheerness until Wednesday or Thursday next for Portsmouth. The Victor, 6 guns, new screw steam-gun-vessel, Counnander T. R. Algernon De Eorsey, No. 1 of the despatch squadron, had a very satisfactory trial of her engines on Saturday last in the fitting basin. The 2Eurotas, 12 guns, screw mortar-ship, is ordered to be ready sad out of the hands of the dockyard on the 29th inst. Mrr. Jonathan Aylen, Master-Attendant of Sheerness, retires by Admiralty order on the 31st of this month, and is to be superseded by Mr. James Brown, late Assistant. lMaster-Attendant of Devonport yard. Nearly 200 seamen belonging to Her Majesty's ship Russell, now stationed in Cork harbour, were on Fridaypre. sented with medals for services in the Crimea and Black Sea fleet during the war. The quarter-deck of the Russell was tastefully fitted up for the occasion. There were present Vice-Admiral Sir George Rose Sartorius, Lady Sartorius, and family; Major-General R. C. Mansel, LE., Mrs. Mansel, and family; and a number of captains in the Royal navy, resident in Queenstown and neighbourhood, with their families; there were also present several military officers who had served in the Crimea. Captain Scott addressed the men, teling them that Her Majesty had given similar medals to a large number of her gallant sailors and soldiers, of whom some were their own shipmates, then present, but that it was impossible for her to do so personaly to aU in the service. He was anxious, therefore, to impress upon them the nature of the distinction conferred upon them, which was a proof that their services were known and acknowledged, and valued by their Qaeen and country. The names of the.men were then called over, and the medals presented to each by Lady Sartorius, Mrs. Mansel, Mrs. Scott, Mrs. Fanshawe, and Mrs. Fulford, the band of the Russell playing the national anthem and other appropriate music. After the medals had been distributed the ship's company gave three hearty cheers for the Queen, the ladies, and their captain. MILTIA. The moves of tho Antrim Artillery from Carrickfergus to Belfast, and the Royal North Down Rifles from Belfast to the .Curragh camp, have been postponed. The Donegal Militia has been ordered to reopen volunteerhig to the regular army on the 25th inst. at Omagh, to make up their quota for the present quarter. A field officer and staff surgeon from the line have been ordered to attend. .20 men only had been passed into the regular army on the previous volunteering. On Monday last Major Fanshaw, of the Staff-Battalion, Mullingar, arrived in the townof Longfordto receive volunteers from the Sligo Rifles for service in the line. The regiment was formed up in quarter-distance column at 11 a.m., and, after a spirited address from their commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel MClintock, more than 100 men responded to the call of their gallant colonel to defend "their Queen and country." After examining and selecting the men of-the proper height, 47 brave fellows were finally approved of and attested for the following regiments :-2d Dragoon Guards, 1; 13th Light Dragoons, 1; Royal Artillery, 6; 12th Regiment, 20; 27th Regiment, 2; 37th Regiment, 1; 40th Regiment, 1; 6Gd Rlegiment, 14; 84th Regiment, L They left town by the l0.30 a.m. train on Thursday, tojointheir respective regiments. Thismakes up the large number of 164 men who have volunteered from this regiment in the short space of seven months; and, as an inducement for bringers of volunteers, the officers have for some months past given an additional 5s. for each volunteer, with the 5s. allowed by the Government, in order to k-eep the regiment up to its establishment.
SoPTHAms coN, March 22.-To-daytheWeninsular and Oriental Company's paddlewheel steamship Valetta, and the fine screw steamship Pera went out for a trial of speed at the measured mile in Stoke's Bay. 'The Valetta obtained an average of 13 597 knots per hour, and the Pera 12-633; bein' a difference of barely a knot between the steaming qualties of each ship. The Valetta, a clipperbuilt paddlewheel vessel, is of only 770 tons burden and 400 horse powver, and was built by the Messrs. Mare, of London, for the rapid conveyance of the overland mails between Malta and Marseilles. The Pera, also constructed by the same eminent shipbuilders, although of 2,600 tons burden, or, in fact, about 1,900 tons largerthan the Valetta, has only the. addition of 50 horse po-wer; the comnparatively smaU difference of speed showing great preference m favour of the screw. Both these ships have been some time at Southampton effecting repairs, the latter vessel having unfortunately become disarranged in the machinery when on her first voyage to Alexandria with the India and Leditennanean malls. UVnder the superintendence of Mr. Lamb. superintending engineer of the Peninsular and Oriental Company, and the Messrs. Rennie, the constructors of the engines, the Pera is believed to be in thorough sea-going condition, and vill sail from Southampton on the 4th proximo. for Alexandria with the India, China, and Mediterranean mails. The Valetta takes her departure for Malta on the 27th inst., touching at the Peninsular ports w ith the mails en route. Several of the directors of the Peninsular aud Oriental Company, together with their friends, were present to witness the trials, after the completion of which the Pera steamed rouna the fleet at Spithead, and then made a run through the squadron of gunboats which lie anchored at the Motherbank. Bothvessels were in excellent trim. Durin the trial the Pera averaged 32'i revolutions of the engines, or 65 of the screw, with 19AlTbs. of steam, the coals used being from the Duffryn Collieries of Messrs. Powell and Sons. The facilities of Cunningham's patent reefing topsails, with which the Pera is fitted, were exhibited and explained to those on board, and were pronounced to be n gre't addition in perfecting the fittings of a sailing vessel of large dimensions. MONSTER MORTAR..-LivERPOOL, Maxch 22.- Mlessrs. George Forrester and Co., the eminent engineers, have completed the manufacture of a monster mortar for Her Majesty's Government, capable of throwing a shell 18 inches in diameter. This immense piece of ordnance was east at the Vauxhall Foundry from charcoal pig iron, received from the Royal Arsenal, at Woolwich, the prodaction of the British colony of Nova Scotia, from the minesof the Acadian Iron Company there, and is, therefore, very important, as developing a new branch of our colonial industry, which may prove of great service both for warlike purposes and the arts of peace. The weight of the casting was of the enormous quantity of 25 tons, and the weight, as complete, is 141 tons. The length is 7 feet 6 inches, the diameter 3 feet 9 inches, the bore 18 inches, and the diameter across the trunnions is 6 feet 7 inches, the diameter of the trunnions being 18 inches. The mortar will pass through the town on Monday, on its wayto the Royal Arsenal, at Woolwich. AnuLTERAinOT or FooD.-At hie last weekly meeting of the Birmingham Board of Guardians MIr. Mahea gave notice of the following motion, whicE may not be' unworthy the attention of similar bodies in the country.-"It having been ascertained beyond doubt that human food is baing adulterated to an alarming extent in this country, and as there are at present in the wom khouse of this parish upwards of 1,000 poor persons, many of whom are of tender age, infirm, and sickly, and a large number of persons receiving outdoor relief, none of whom have any choice in the selection of their fgod, or means of detecting impurities in it-Resolved, that it is the duty of their guardians to know as far as practicable that they are supplied with sound food and medicine; and, with a view thereto, the clerk of the board be directed to inform aUl persons under contract to supply food and drugs to this'parish, that from and after the 26th of April the articles anpplied by them for the use of the poor shall be subject to such analyzationias the guardians mlay from time to time think proper to authorize, wiithoult further notice from this board." EAST INDIA AND OuDE.-It appears from a return issued on Saturday that the amount outstanding of loans received from the King of Oude, the interest of which is applicable to the payment of stipends and allowances to members of the family and dependents of His Majesty and to the poor of Lucknow, is 1SO,07,234 rupees. T1E ISLE Or MIAN.-The number of causes tried and decided in 1853 by the high bailiffs of the Isle of 3Man amounted to 709, the highest sum they are empowered to decide on being 1. 14s. 3Ad., or 40s. Mfanx currency. The numnber of causes tried bythe "deemsters" of the Isle inl1854! was, southern district, 666, and northern district 400.

SPRING ASSIZES. I~~ OXFORD CIRCeT SEHREWSBUlRY. MARCHI 22. Crv. COuTrB.-(Beforc Mr. Baron. BaRAwimrL at a; Comnn ury.)- MORIRIS V. YADDOXL Mr. Whateley, Q.C., and fr. Davis appeared for the plaintiffe and t r. SereantEigott and Itr. Scotland for the defenda-nt. The plaintiff in this action, Ann Morris, was a yowng woman 28 yeats of age, and, according to the statement of her counsel, possessed of considerable personal attractions. The defendant, John Morris, was a young farmer and miller residing in the vilage of Harley, near Much Wenlock, in this county, and the action was brought against him by the plaintiffto recover damages for breach of promise of marriage. The defendant pleaded only the general issue. It appeared from the evidence given by the plaintiff's witnesses tbat the parties became acquainted with one another at the Unicorn Inn at Harley, in the year 1851. The Unicorn was a small publichouse, which, with an acre of land, was rented at an ancient rent of 6C. a-year by one Richard Langford, who not only sold ale and beer, but also made and mended boots and shoes. Richard Langford had married a Miss Morris, and it appeared that, in tho month of March, 1851, her sister, Ann M1orris, the present plaintiff, came to the Unicorn on a visit, and also to assist her sister in the house. The defendant had been a visitor at the Unicorn for the sake of its brandy and water; but soon after Ann's arrival it was observed that his visits becaime more frequent, until at length he became very partial to her, called her "my dear," gave her a silver watch, and was " considered as her suitor." It did not appear, however, that he made any distinct proposals, or that he walked oat with the plaintiff, or introduced her to his friends, buf it was stated as a fact of some imnortancein the case that, after a certain period, he no longer paid for what he drank at the Unicorn, but was entertained by the landlord gratis. It appeared that another of the plaintiff's sisters had married a MIr. Hodgitts, of Leamington, and tbat, in the month of September, 1851, Air. and Mrs. Hodgitts went on a visit to MIr. and Mrs. Langford at the Unicorn. The defendant was there, and invited the gentlemen to go and have a day's shooting on his farm. This they did the next day, and, in the course of the visit, 'odgitts observed to the defendant,-" Jladdox, you seem to have a very crabbed old house-keeper." Upon this the defendant said that he hoped the next time Iodgitts came he should be able to male him more comfortable. Hodgitts thereupon recommended matrimony, and told the defendant ae could not do better tb,li follow his (Hodgitte's) example; to which the defendant replied thathe was alreadymeditatingthatstep, and plainly. intimated that the said " Ann" was to be his wife. In the evening the whole party were entertained at supper at the Unicorn, and Ann sat at table by the defendant's side. This supper was given at the joint expense of Hodgitts and the landlord. It was not on that night, but -it was somewhere about the same time, that MIr. Langford, together with the defendant and several other guests, were had tup before the magistrates and fined for being drunk and disorderly at the Unicorn at night. Matters went on in this way for some time till, in the month of March, 1852, it appeared that Ann had been too lavish of her favours, and she found it necessary to retire to Mrs. Hodgitts's house at Leamington to be confined. Just before this event happened the defendant was informed by Mr. Langford of her state, when he said it was a " bad job for both of them i" and, op a subsequent occasion, he told the same party that the plaintiff "had no occasion to make herselfill, as he (the defendant) had always told her he would marry her, and she knew that very welL" He said he could not marry her at that time, as he was under obligations to a Mr. Adeney, but that when he was free he would do so. The plaintiff was confined in July, 1852, and in the autumn of the same year she returned to the 'Unicorn. The farmer and miller had by that time ceased to visit at the Unicorn, and it did not appear that during the whole of the next year, 1853, any communication or correspondence took place between the Darties. In the year 185 the plaintiffreturned to Ieamningt6n, and affiliated her child upon the defendant, and then returned to Harley. Here matters rested for some time, but it came to pass that, in the year 1854, the defendant was again at the Umcorn, and asked Mlrs. Langford whether she had heard that he was going to be-married'? UporL that Mr. Langford said he had heard it, but he did-not believe it, because he (the defendant) had been so long to see his sister. The defendant then said, "I No, when I marry, it will be Ann." A few minutes afterwards he vwas in the parlour, with Ann, seated on the sofa, and telling her not to cry and make herself unhappy, for he would marry her, andshe should have the child with her if she liked. He also induced the plaintiff to give np the company of another young man, who was paying his addresses to her, by the assurance that he meant ton marry her. But, notwithstanding all these promises, the defendant proved false at last; and, i the month of Augst, 1855, he consummated his treachery by marrying Charlotte Wheeler, of Mfuch Werdock. The present action- was then brought to recover damages for' the breach of promise of which he had been guilty, and to compensate the plaintiff for the injury which she had sustained, Mr. W sHA¶m ,. in summnng np the plaintiff's evidence, made a warm appeal to the jury to give the plaintiff exemplary damages for the injury which she had sustained by the defendant's treachery and falsehood. The learned counsel also quoted some poetry, which seeined to produce a lively effect upon the minds of the jury. Mr. Serjeant PIGOT, in addressing the jury for the defendant, altogether denied that his client had ever promisel tonarry the plaintiff. He had nevrer written her a single letter, he had not taken her to church, nor introducei her to his friends, norinvitedher to his house. The whole case for the plaintiff rested on the evidence of her relation,i the defendant. lf there had been any' truth in the story vhich they now told the action woud have been brought long ago. The defendant broke off his conneion with thi plaintiff in the year 1852; anhdit was not pretended that in the year 1853 he had had any correspondence with her. Ia that year the child was affiliated upon him, and if there had been any breach of promise, then would have been the time to brmg this action. That was not done; but in the year 1854, when the defendant was about to be married to his present wife, the witnesses pretended that he had made a fresh promise tomarrythe plaintiff. That was too improbable a story to be beieved, and he (the learned Serjeant) hoped the jury would not give any credit to it. Mr. Baron BRAswELTn, in summing ap the evidence, said thatin general lie did not approve actions of this description, for he thought that when people fell in love and quarrelled, the less they said about it the better, At the same time, the plamntiff had a right to bring the action, and it was the duty of the jury to consider the evidence and come to a just conclusiein upon it. Hlis Lordship thea summaed np the evidence, and, indeed, read over the whole of i~t, pointing out to the jury that they had the positive oaths of the witnesses as to the defendant's Promise. It would be for them to say whether or not they lieved the evidence, and, if they did, it would be their duty to find a verdict for the plaintiff, with such damages as they might think her entitled to. The jury retired for some time to consider their verdict, and on their return into court found for the plaintiffDamages 9001. CnBr.r COURT.-(Before Mr. Justicc CRESSWVELL) 7ohn Hueghes, 25, a letter-stamper in the post-office at Shrevsbury, was chanzed with stealing a post letter containing money, on the 21s$ of November, 1855, at Shrewsbury. MWr. Whateley, Q,C., and r. Bros appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. Scotland defended the prisoner. It appeared that, on the 21st of November last, the prisoner nad been for about five months emculoved in the post-offlce at Shrewesbury in the capacity of a letterstamper. On the arrival of the Hlereford mail, at about 10 'clock that n,ight, he conmenced stamping the letters which were laid before him in rows for that propose. While engaged in doing this he was seen by another clerk to feel a letter, and then lay it on one side with the direction down. The clerk went across the room to fetch some more letters to be stamped, and on his return, finding that the letter which the prisoner had laid aside was gone, told his superior what hehad seen. The latter watched the prisoner, and presently sawhim fumblingwith hiswaistcoat, go out of doors, and shut the -gates, a duty which was usually nerformed by the junior stamper in the office, and iot by the prisoner. In a minute or two he came back into the lobby, and was there busy with some empty bags, and was seen to peep twice into the office. The clerk, Thomas, upon this went into the lobby where the prisoner was and lit the gas, and as soon as he had done that the prisoner returned to the office, went again to the stamping table, and began to alter the date of the stamp for the following day. 'Thomas followed him into the office, and observed that he was about 25 minutes in doing what would not take more than five minutes, and, in fact, that he set and reset the stamp several times. It now wanted only three minutes to 11 o'clock, and nearly all the clerks had left the Pngth the prisoner turned to go, and as soon as he had gone way from the'table the cleric Thomas picked up a letter from th.e ground close by the prisoner's feet. Ze at once charged the prisoner writh stealing it, and told him that if he wrould not admit that he had stolen it he would send for a policeman. The prisoner then made a statement. Mr. SCOTLAhXD objected to this statement being given in evidence, upon the ground that it was made after a threat to send toT a policeman. Mr. Justice CREsSWELL said, the evidence could not be received. Upon further evidence, it appeared that the prisoner was taken before the postmaster, and there made a statement, which was excluded upon the ground that it also was made under the influence ofthe original threat. Eventually a policeman was sent for, and he took the prisoner into custody, and charged him with stealing the letter. The prisoner again made a statement. Mr. SCOTLAND objected to this statement beir.g given in evidence, unless it could be shown that the fear under-which the prisoner had made the first confession was effectually dispelled. £ Mr. Justice CRESSWELL said, the evidence musk be received. The original threat was, that a constable should be sent for; but when that had been done and the prisoner was actually in custody, the threat couldno longer operate. His Iordship cited a case precisely srmilar where the evidence Wa1S admitted. It was then proved that the Prisoner told the policeman that he was so confused at M. Thomas watching him that he dropped the letter, and he didn't know what possessed him to take it. M1r. SCOTLAND then addressed the jury for the prisoner, and called several witnesses, who gave him a good character. One of them said that through the prisoner's good character, and his (the witnesss) interest, the prisoner got theapnointment. the 5ustime C}1Es1YELL asked which prevailed most, tho "good character," or the-witnesss "interest?" The Witness said,-Why, I recormended him. Mr. Justice CRE RSVWELM thencsummed up the evidence, And the jury found the prisoner Guitlty, but recomnmended hinm to mercy on account of his preNious character. Sentence deferred.
MB. DYCE SOMBRE'S WILL. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In your journal of ite 18th inst. there appears a letter signed " Bartle J. I. Frere," containing an attack upon the East India Company, upon Mr. H. T. Piinsep, one of its directors, and upon ourselves, as the solicitors of the latter, in relation to the wil of the late Mr. Dycea Sombre. We appeal to your sense of justice to give insertion to the following observations in reply. From the terms in which Mr. Bartle J. L. Frere introduces himself to the notice of your readers it might be inferred that he was some disinterestea friend of India, anxious only, on public grounds, for the due administration of its revenues. Your readers, however, should understand that this disinterested gentleman is the private solicitor of Mrs. Dyce Sombre, -who is engageL! in litigation with the East India Company and nith Mr. Priap on tbe aubject of ber late husband's ill, the validity of which is at this moment the subject of a pendiug suit. We shall not follow the irregular example set us by Mr. Bartle J. L. Erere of discussng in the columns of a newspaper the details of a case pending in-a court of law. On the 3d of April next the whole mnatter vill come before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in the shape of a formal appeal from the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, and until that appeal has been heard we trust the public will suspend their judgment on the merits of this extraordinary and most interesting case. But in the meantime -we crave permission to supply some material omis-ions in Mr. Frere's letter and to lay before your readers a brief explaPation of what the question in dispute really is, in contrast to his laborious and careful statement of what it is not. On the 25th of June, 1849, lMr. Dyce Sombre made the will which is the subject of the present controversy, andl whicn was prepared from written instructions, wholly his own, and in his own hand witing. He had derived fronm the liberality of her Highness the Begwun Sombre (with whom he had no blood relationship) a palace and considerable landed property at Sirdanah, together with a very large personal estate, the accumulated savings from the revenues of a large jaghire, secured to her for life by Lord Lake, after the battle of Delhi, in the year 1801. With these bequests he considered that he had also inhented the duty of caring for and protecting her numerous pensioners and retainers and the various objects of her munificent charity. Having, on the occasion of his il-starred marriage, settled nearly 150,0001. on M-s. Dyce Sombre for her life; having also made an ample and most; liberal provision for each of his two sisters, being childlesC and vwhoUy without other relations, ir. Dyce Sombre conceived that he could not do greater honour to the memorny of his benefactress, the Begum, or better fulfil those moral obligations which he had inherited with her fortune, and wlhich he had pledged himself to her never to forget,htan by disposing thereof in such way as -would ultimately. restore to the natives of India the accumulated fund which had been originally derived from them. Accordingly, by the will in question (in additioin to the bequeststo which Mr. Frere hasthought fit to calltheattention of the public),- L He makes provision for the payment of nearly SCsmall annuities or pensions to old and faithful retainers of the Begam and himself, their families, and children, all of whose names he accurately remembered. 2. He gives divers legacies of larger amount to persons of higher station, who had been in the military or other service of the Begum. 3. Besides other charitable legacies and bequests, he gives 25,000 Company's runees (about 12,500e sterling) to his executors intrust " for the support and benefit of the b]ind, lame, or indigent inhabit.ants of Sirdanah and its neighb,ourhdood, without any distinction of caste or re- -4. le gives the whole residue of his princely fortune to the East lndia Company upon irust *- fer the endowment and establishment in the Palace of Sirdanah of an institution to be called the ' Sombre College,' the object of whielh shall be to provide for the education of the higher classes of the natives of India without any distinction of religion, and to qualify them for holding public and other situations of trust." We have quoted the very language of the will, with a printed copy of which we take leave to trouble ycou Such, Sir, is the will uhich the East India Company, acting under the advice of the mnosteminuent counsel at thea bar, in the discharge of a great public trust as the govelrnors of India and for the benefit of the natives of India, have felt it their duty so far to support as to take care that, its validity shall be submitted to and determined by the highest appropriate tribunal. Such is the will which irs. Dyce Sombre, not content -with the magnificent dowry of nearly 5,0001. per annum provided for her, is seeking to overturn and subvert, in order that, come what may of the poor pensioners of the Begum and her late husband, of the ' lamne, bliud, andiimpotent poor" of Siraanah, and of the education of the higher classes of the natives of India, she may get, for her own personal use and benefit., halE the capital of his fortune l It may suit the sactics of Ytr. F!rere, the ?private solicitor of 2,Irs. Dyce Sombre, to suppress and conceal these material features of the wilL. Whether such suppression is consistent either with ordinary fairness and candour, or with his assumed character of the friend of India, may be left to your readers to determine. It is undonbtedly true that, although the ration-lity of the act done is strong evidence of the sanity of the agent, yet the most rational and meritorious will may be set aside, if at thetime of making it the testator wvas the subject of insane delusions. Whether on the 25th of June, 1849, -when he made the will now in (question, or on the 13th of August following, when he made a short codicil, confir:nirg its provisions, Mr. Dyrce Sombre was the subject of any such delusions is the whole question in the pending cause. We may observe, on this point, that the nwill and codicil are attested by no fewer than three eminent physicians (in fact, by four, inasmuch as, owing to the absence from Paris of one of the physicians -who had attested the will, his place was supplied by another -who attested the codicil). All four have been examined as witnesses in the cause, and have stated on oath their dear and nnhesital-ng con.- viction that, whatever Mr. Dyce Sombre nmigt have been at any antecedent period, he was at the dates in (question entirely free fiom all insane delusions, and reifec-.ly competent to do any act requiring thought, jud,iient, andl reflection. Now,the question ofthe state of Mlr. Dyce Somlbres mind in the months of June and August, 1849, never Ihs and never could have been before either Lord LyndliurAt or L-,r Cottenbab , whose judicial conne:don -with the ease had entirely ceased before (in the case of Lord Ly.dlhurst many years before) the disputed will was madc. Lord Cotteichanu had, howvever, by an express decree givze: to the so-called "lunatic" the absolute disposal of his large incomle (sn:bject only to the payment of an allowvance of 4,&JO. per- a. mona to Mrs. Dyce Sombre for her muain tenance), wvith full liberty to spend it whnere and howt he pleasedl, wvithottt control or account. It is true that Sir John Dodson has recently refmsed prohate of the will, and we shall not be guilty of the inde-. corm of commenting on his judgment. SAttlice it to say, that the East India Company and M1r. Prinsep ale diswatisfRed therew-ith, and, acting under the advice of mnost edinent counsel, have lodged an appelal thenefrous to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council; in order that a case so novel, so complicated in its facts, and so inqpotant in its results muay be considered and determaincdl by thie highest court of jVdicature. We had alwnvays snlu osed it to be the common right of the subjects of-this rein, to ypeal fiomr the decision of an inferior to a superior tritiluln; and we have yetto learn that there is anyLv a or usige by which the East India Company or Mr. Prinsep caun be-as we are sure there is no ground, in reason or jjuustC, why they ought to be-debarred from the exeercise of that riglht. On the 3d of April the appeal is appointed to be heard, and the merits of this singular- case will then be fully investigated and decided. We have the honour to be, Sir, Yonr verv obedient servants DESBOROUGH, YO UN!IG, AMD DESBOROUGUT 13, 6Sise-]ane, Bucklemsbury.

The ship Black-wall, for London, has 88,000 ounces itf gold on freight. The Red Jacket, for Liverpool, wras intended to leave on the 18th of January. Through the courtesy of Messrs. Baines and. Co. Xle have received our correspondent's letter vitd Cork: - "Melbourne. Dec. 25. "Having heard that in consequence of some damage -which the Lightning had sustained at sea a survey had been Leld upon her, and that she might be detained for some tlbys, I wrotebytheBlack-wall, advertised to sail on the 22d inst.; but as the Lightning will sail to-morrow morning, and, as the Blackwall is still in port, I shall rewrite an account of recent ovanta, ,na 3my letter by the Blackkwall nay, probably, be put into the fire. *'By the James Baines (25tth of November) and the EBmia (10th of December) I have already put you in possession of the leading events connected with the throes and travail of what the official members call responsible %Uovernment. The Constitutional Act passed here is now, as yo' know, the schedule of an act of Parliament, and therefore is ' parcel thereof,' and to be 'read therewith.' By the 5th section of the act the Governor is directed to proclaim it within one month after a copy shall have been received in the colony, and it is to ' take effect from the day of such proclamation.' But the last section of the schedule hill enacts that ' the foregoing provisions of this act shall have no force or effect until (among other things) the entire management of the waste lands of the Crown and the proceeds thereof shall be vested in the Legislature of the said colony.' This section is recited in the preamble of the act of Parliament, and an ' interpretation clause ' in the act explains the word 'I.egislature' to mean the new Legislature called into existence by the new act. This Legislature cannot have its birth until the present Council shall have passed an electoral act. " The present or rather late officers of the Governmentfor we have an interregnum-chose to act upon the first section, and to hold that the new constitution came into force and effect on the 23d of November ; but the representative members considered that the affirmative words of the fifth section were merely directory, and they were 'entirely overridden by the negative words of the last section, which were enactive and imperative, and that the fullblown constitution could not come into operation until such a Legislature was in existence as to satisfy the interpretation clause of the new act, the only body that could take the 'entire control and management of the waste lands of the Crown and the proceeds thereof.' "Entertaining these views, after the official gentlemen had gone through a sort of pantomime of resigning their offices and receiving new commissions, being sworn in tnew on the 30th of November, the representative members met together and framed a set of resolutions, a copy of which I have already sent you, together with thle Governofs minute. These resolutions were moved on the 4th of December by Dr. Greeves, one of the city members, were debated two days, but were lost, the Government having a nmjority of one. "This may be deemed the commencement of an organized opposition. "On the 18th, in pursuance of a previous notice, Mr. William Nicholson, member for the metropolitan connty of Worth Bourke, moved a resolution in favour of the ballot. This motion was not made in concert with the representa-tive members genarAly and there was no need whatever for treating it as a question to try the strength of tho Government; bat Mr. Haines, the Chief Secretary, announcedthat the members of the Government were unanimously opposed to it, and anti-ballot was understood.to be a Government principle. The sabject was debated on two consecutive evcnings, and was carried by a majority of 33 to 25-a very large majority, when it is considered that the Government has the power of appointing 22 members of the House, of whom 11 maybe officials, andit has actually exercised that power to the extent of appointing 18, though some of their nominees voted for the ballot. ` On Thursday, the 20th, Mr. Raines announced to the House that he and his colleagues had tendered their resignations, and that they only held office until their successors could be appointed; and on the following day Mr. William Nicholson, the mover of the ballot resolution, was ' sent for.' The morning papers found no difficulty in making a programme of a Ministry founded on fact, or rather on the position occupied by certain names in the public mind. " The work which hMr. Nicholson has to perform is one of considerable difficulty. In the first place, not oue of the mnen he must take have had asiy expectation of being suddenly called upon to make a Ministry. Their opposition has not been conducted like that of men who, being for a time, by a turn of the wheel of fortune, out, have ever present to their minds the probability or pocsibility of being again in. Again, only one on the opposition side has had any experience in office of a Ministerial character-namely, Xr. Chapman. But then, on the other hand, the experience ,of the official party is not great, except that of MIr. Stawelt the Attorney-General, and some of them have turned ont failures. Some of the Opposition, however, having been accustomed to wield very extensive affairs of business, will soon find that affairs of State are not more difficult. Another difficulty is that Mr. O'Shanassy, Dr. Greeves, and Xr. Fawkner, who have acted with the representative members, voted against the ballot. They are said to be greatly mortified by the result, and, with the exception, perhaps, of Dr. Greeves, will do all they can to damage Mr. XichoLson' Administration. " And now let me introduce you to a peculiar phase of social and political life in our colonies. Mr. NTicholson is, perhaps, the very best man in that house to command respect for his administration. His integrity is spotless, he is endowed with common sense in no ordinary degree, and lie has that administrative capacity which the architects of a coisunercial fortune camnot be destitute of. He has an appropriate command of good mother English, uttered -with a not unplessing Cumberland accent. Although he com3nenced life as a grocer, it would be very difficult to select from the 66 members of the House a man so wvell entitled to the confidence of the House and the country-and he liasit. "If the Misterial defeat had taken place on the resolutions, the member sent for would most likely have been O'ShIanassy, and he, like Nicholson, is a colonial phenomenon of not usifrequent occurrence. He is a man of considerable ability, good power of speaking, and untiring industry. He is in easy circumstaness-the results of a small shop, between a slop-shop and a .millinery shop in iMelbourne. This he keeps up stpl, managed, I believe, by. some of his family; whereas, Mfr. STicholson has exchanged the shop for the counting-house and the craft of the merchant. Now, what I wish to point out is that these men are estimated for their personal qualifications, and none but a few boobies ever think of the shop, except as a source of credit. "Nothing has been finally announced as to theformation of the Ministry, but it was inderstood this afternoonthat all 3dr.Nicholson's difficulties had vanished into tbin air, and that to-morrow he idll be prepared to submit his list to Sir Charles Hotham, who has been very ill for some days, but is now better. The Government have had seven public officers in the House-namely, the Chief Secretary, the Treasurer, the Attorney-General, the Solicitor-General, the chief Commissioner of Trade andCustoms, the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Surveyor-General,andtheCommissioner of Public Works. Of these Captain Clarke (formerly Deniszon's private secretary), Surveyor-General, and also Com3nissioner of Crown Lands, is, it Is reported, wiling to retain jiLs office of Surveyor-Gencral, and toleave hisParliamentary functions to the Cominisiosicr of Crown Lands. The Colonial Ensiineer and Commissioner of Public WIorks, Captain PasJey, avilI do the like; asid the following is believed to con6titnte the Ministerial list:- ColonlW-'3ecrciary-W. Nicholson. Treasurer-Goodmran. Attornay-Ge-rewal-Chapman. Siolicitor- Genesal-O'oleswvostls (?) 1r.deand CnstoEw-31'C'ulloch. Crown Lands and Siuivey-Dr. Greeves (or Mlillar) and Czptain Ularke. Public *'orl;s-Millar (o? Dr. Greeves) and Captain Pascy. "Tke policy ef this IlinitYr wSill robably be to 3£s an cltctel ae&, end an ,.ct agaitnst bribery, "I ought to add that the interpretation put by the law officers of the Crown in Sydney upon clauses of the New South Wales Constitution, exactly similar to those upon lwhich I ha-se coiuuented, coincides wvith that of our ' Opposition,' and not with that of the late law officers of the Crown. "The supplv of gold keeps up, and, as quartz-crushing machinery imlproves, the quantity is likely rather to increase than diminish. The following statemrent of the receipts by escort and exports is from Mr. KuhlI's weekly account, and is comnplete up to last Saturday:- " ' The escorts have brought from BaDlarat, including Geelong ... 20,211 oz.

It originated in an inn, which it destroyed, with the Adelphi and several other buildings, mostly of wood. Unfortunately, several lives were lost. You have nost likely had particulars from the newspapers. " On the 16th and 17th iust. a calamity not less destructive of life and property occurred in a heavy flood, of which tlle following is the newspaper account "'On the evening of the former day, and again on the latter, a tbunderstorm was followed by a tremendous shower of bailstones as large as marbles, and by a deluge of rain. The gullies vere soon flooded by torrents, and the ordinary channels proved quite insufficient to carry off the ater; honses and .stores were carried away; the deep hafts, sunk v-ith much toil and at great expense, were filled to the brim and had their worksundermined, and piles of washing stuff were swept away. The destruction of property consequent on this flood, is estimated at 120,OOOZ. By this visitation, too, there was a lamentable loss of life, sLx persons having been drowned on the evening of the 16tll. iThe severity of this calamity, it is stated, would have been much dihninished had proper precautions been taken to provide for the unimpeded flowv of the water by its natural channels. The necessity of the erection of Ballarat into a municipality is obvious frotm these two eveuts. MeasuTes might then 'be taken for mitigating the effect of such occnrrences, if they could not be in a great measure prevented."' and then di-,ive. %,,Id issue the newv writs as soon as P°;; sible. of any import=ce, especially such aa ir, vOl thet tpenditure of money, ought to be left to the '.Aore nesfectly .representative Legislature. A portion ot thl pSesent Council was elected when the population of the eoloby was under 80,000; another portion when it was about 150,000; the mrembers for the diggings alone rrpresent the new state of things. The population must now be ut least 320,000. "I hope you w%ill not consider the above to be too large a dose of local politics. Our colonial vanity makes us believe that details connected with our inauguration of a new colonial system ought to interest the mnetropolis of nearly half a hujidred colonies and dependencies.
THB M3EDITERRAiYEANT. -0 SOUTHAMPTON, Ktncm 23. By the Peninsular and Oriental Company's screw steamiship Alia, Captain R. W.

Dunring the voyage the weather was remarkably fine, with lEght' head winds. On the outward voyage, on the 2d of Mrarch, when off the island of Galita, 10 waterspouts were observea auu th. iBip. Axt-r r0ltaln foabut hnlf. an hour some gradually disappeared, while others burst and discharged near the vessel. The weather during the day had been squally, with heavy rain. It is seldom that so many of these phenomena are seen so numerous in the Mediterranean. The Alma passed several steamers and ships, but they did not make their numbers. At Alexandria were the Turkish steam frigate Hadji Baba, a steamsloop, uame unknown, and the Pasha's yacht Faad Gahaad; the Austrian frigate Venus sailed from Alexandria on the 8th inst. At Malta were Her Majesty's ships Royal Albert, Hannibal, Odin, Agamemnon, Princess Royal, Curacoa, Tribune, Terrible, Gladiator, Miranda, Hibernia, 3fedina, Frirebrand, Triton, and Beagle, the Dutch frigate, De Ruyter, a Turkish frigate, and the Peninsular and Oriental Company's ships Candia (steam transport), Vectis, and Euxine.

Our dates from Gibraltar are to the 18th inst. 7ler Majesty's ship Ariel was lying in the bay. IHer Majesty's screw steam frigate Cossack, wliich had returned fr-om a cruise to the eastward, sailed for England on the 17th inst. The steam transport Sarah Sands, which arrived at Gibraltar on the 18th inst. from liverpool, with artillerymen, horses, &c., landed 21 of the animals sick and injnred; and, having filled up with mules from the depot in the garrison, started for her destination on the 15th. The Earl of Durham steam transport sailed from Gibraltar for Malta'and Constantinople, with camp equipage and provisions for the British army, on the night of the 14th. The steam transport Norman, with artillerymen and horses from Woolwich for Balaklava, sailed the same evening. The British steamer Karnak, seven days from Liverpool, arrived at Gibraltar on the 1.5th inst. The steam transport Hlydaspes, six days from Southampton, with horse artillery, &c., for the Crimea, reached Gibraltar on the 15th inst., and after coaling, resumed her voyage on the following day, The whole of the men were in excellent health and spirits. but five of the horses had perished, it is said, chiefly owing to defective ventilation, want of drainage, and the rough weather encountered on the passage. Two others died during the night of the 15th, owing to the great heat on the lower deck whiclh existed after the steamer had anchored. At Gibraltar every horse was removed from his stall, which was thoroughly cleansed, and the animals were well groomed. Captain Hyde made every effort to remedy the defect in the ventilation and drainage, and it was believed had so far succecded as to prevent further casualties. The steam-trausport Balbec, cnToutefroruthe Crimea, sailedfrom Gibraltar for Spithead on the 17th. The Balbec brings 77 Russian guns, 132 barrels, 5 boxes, and 11 packages of gunpowder, wvhich she took on board at Balallava, and the following passengers :-Majors Hope and Penton, Lieutenants Butler and Waller, Bessrs. Hardinge, Belfield, Parkinson, and 36 others. The Swedish sloop of war Lagerbjelkc sailed for the westward on the .moining of the 16th inst. Th8 steam transport Jura, with troops for the Crimea, passed Gibraltar on the 16th. The Peninsular and Oriental Company's mail steamship Tagus, with the Peninsular mails left Gibraltar for Southampton, calling at Cadiz, Lisbon, &c., on the 15th inst. A melancholy accident took place on the 17th inst. at Gibraltar at one of the quarries on the north front by the explosion of a mine, by whiqh two men were killed on the spot and another very seriouslywounded. It appears thatthe mine was fired, but after some time, no explosion taking place, three of the workmen proceeded to the spot for the purpose of repriming it, and while doing so the powder ignited and caused the accident. Exchange at Gibraltar for bills on London at 90 days was at 504 to ; Paris, 5f. 33c.; Marseilles, 5f. 39c.; Spanish pillared dollars, 8 per cent. premium.
I| TO THE EDITOR 03F THE TTAlES. Sir,-In reply to your correspondent " Old Bohca," admitting that the black and green tea of commerce are identical in their origin, that will not in the least affect what I have already stated-viz., that black and green tea (thea bo7jea and thea viridis) aro two distinct species. That they have characteristics wbich entitle them to be considered as such is .shown by the fact of one being so much hardier, and thriving wel in the open ground with but slight protection even in this country, while the other reqwres careful culture even in a greenhoitse. And, as " Oll Bohea" has quoted me as an authority, I uxay he allowed to refer himu in turn to one equally good onILU natters connected vith botany-Loudon's ifortus Di;44siC= iv.-hero lie plants are mentioned as two distinct ip)cles, under the names "tLea &oke&'" and "thea viridis": respectively; so that, with all due deference to the experience of "Old Bohea," ho will see there really is so07JC Nsential difference between them, a::d that I have n6t spoeien so unadvisedly On the sFi;xgx tc. he seems to iMaVine.

- FORfGzY 1TqELLIaGENCE. FRANCE. (ER1Om oTm ow cORBRsro.PylDEN%T.) PI'RIS, S&TURDnY, MARCSI Zh Ii P.M.Ni The following is the protest alluded to in lay I letter of Wednesday, as addressed to Prince (;hika, I Hospodar of l\foldavia, by the Boyorxs, the clergy, and the municipal bodies of that Principality, against the resolultions adopted by Turkey in the con- ferecnes at Constantinople:i "Most Serene Highness,-The high contracting Powers at Vienna have not lost sight of the fature of the Roumanic Principalities in their great work of pacification; and the first point of the preliminaries of, peace recognizes a princi-. ple and guarantees the rights which the Principalities hold from the stipulations entered into with the Sublime Porte in the 15th and 1lth centuries, and the most essential of which is the selE-governnuent, the election of the Plince by the Ronmains from among themselves, and a national representation. The Sublime Porte, on its side, had aLready given the same assurances to the Roumains through its Conmmissioner in the Principalities, Dervish Pasha, M ho in 1854 said to thena these words, 'We declare that the honour and glory of His Majesty tho Sultan are interested in the conservation of your ancient rights.' "These assurances, given solemnly to the Roumnais, have been for them, in the midst of the misfortunes and disasters of these latter days, a pledge of hope that at the conclusion of peace not only would their incontestable rights be confirmed anew, but that the union of the two Principalities would be granted, seeing that their union would protect their own interests and those of Europe on the Danube, and realize their providential mission in the East. The greater was the confidence of the Poumains in these promises the greater their disappointment when they learned that the representatives of the greap Powers at the conferences at Constantinople laid the basis of the new organization to be given to the Principalities without having previously consulted their wishes, as regards the very preliminaripes of peace, while the resolutions adopted in these conferences are so many violations of the sacred rights of the Roumains-iglhts whichhad always been respected even n the most disastrous days of our history. " Our confidence in the justice and wisdom of the great PowerswiRlnotletus regard as definitivethe projects adopted by the conferences at Constantinople, nor allow us to believe that the P.oumains are to be deprived of their right to establish for themselves and their country thelawsrequired by their necessitiesand theprogress of time. and that the fature constitutionwill be framed at Constantinople under the control of the SublimePorte. In fact, if the decisionsof the mem bers of the conferences at Constantinople were to have the force of lawthe GeneralAssemblywhich,from all time, alone exercised legislative power in-the Principalities, in place of comprising all the elements of life in the nation-property, merit, commerce, iudustry-would disappear in order to give place to a Senate incompatible with our traditions and our national character. The Prince would no longer be the elect of the nation, but siniply a Turkish functionary. The Sublime Porte would take him from a very short list of candidates. Several internal administrative and legislative measures would be from that moment taken out of the hands of the national representatives, and decided by the| members of the conferences themselves. In point of fact, the rights of the Roumains to a national adnministration and legislature would be abolished at once by the declaration that all the laws relating to industry and commerce, that all the measures of public interest adopted by Turkey, would be de jvre applicable to the Principalities, as constituting an integral part of the Ottoman empire. In a word, the independence of the national government established in one of the articles of the same conferences would ,-e completely annulled by the articles following, so tlut the solemn engagement that the ancient rights and institutions of the Principalities shalLbe henceforth placed under the guarantee of European public law becomes ilusory, and Mloldavia and WaUachia are reduced to the condition of Turkish Pashalics, directly and entirely depending on Constantinople. " Righness,-Our conscience tells vhs that the Primcipalities have done nothing to incur, at a period of jastice and civilization, the loss of rights the dearest and most sacred which our ancestors have maintained intact at a time when brutal force alone gave the law to the people. At such a momnent of dangeras the present our daty towards our fathers, who have transmitted them to us-towards our descendants, to whom we ought to transmit them intact-towards the Sublime Porte itself, and to Europe at large,-forbids us to accept a position contrary to our capitulations and incompatible with our laws and usages, without raising our voice to protest and declare, in the face of the world, that the rights of the Principalties may be violated. but cannot be annulled. In the absence of the General Assmbly, we, tl,o undersigned, representatives of the clergy, Boyards, and corporations, fulfil a sacred duty in addressing ourselves to your highness, and in praying you, 5 a prince, a Christian, and a Poumain, not to allow the rights of our country to be sacrificed without employing the means required by the cirenantances, by the high.position of your Highness, and by your duty to the country of which you are the head, and also to cause this protest to be laid before the Congress of Paris, to whom we appeal with confidence against the Conferences at Constantinople. " This act will not be considered a want of respect towards our august Suzerain, or want of confidence in the justice of the Powers that have takenunder their protection the fate of the Principalities. Necessity has driven us to this step. "Our country wiU remain calm. Its attitude will win for it, we hope, the esteem of Europe, in the justice of which we have ful confidence. But if, after ages of our national and political cxistcnce, the Principa7ities, in the midst of a war undertaken for the people of the East, are destined to see their rights imperilled and sacrificed, i; is our duty to protest beforehand, and in the presence of God and the civilized world, against the violence offered to a Christian and free nation, so that even while succumbing we may earn the approbation of] posterity, the esteem even of our enemies, and the force which is impartedby the consciousness of duties fulfilled. " March 9, 1856." (Here follow the signatures of the petitioners, to the number of several thousands.) The following is the petition addressed to the President of the Congress of Paris by the Roumains resident in Paris "Excellency,-The snccessive military occupations and the abuses of power which have afflicted our country, the Danubian Principalities, for two years past, have imposed on it, as your Excellencies are well aware, enormous sacrifices, greater than those even of the countries that have had the glory of taking an active part in the present war. But what up to the present has caused its nmisfortune now menaces its prosperity, by preventing it from exposing its wvshes and necessities to those who have the power and the desire to create on the Danube a strong and prosperous state, inasmuch as Austria and the Porte expressly forbid, under the severest penalty, aUl manifestation of public opinion in the Principalities. " We, the Roumains resident in Paris, the only ones who on divers occasions have raised a voice in the name of our fellow-citizens at this critical moment, when the sentence of death of the dloldo-WaUachian people, or the confirnation of their incontestable rights, is about to issnte from the deliberations of the Plenipotentiaries of the great Powers, feel in our souls the anguish of 5,OO,000 of our brethren, who are not permitted to utter a word, even of despair, or to shed a tear of sorrow, and we feel ourselves forced to remiind you onice more of what the Roumains unanirnously and especially desire, anid wvhich also is the keystone of t'he new political and social edifice to be founded in Moldo-Waliachia. "The identity of origin, language, religion, wants, usages, and institutions of the inhabitants, the interest of Europe, even their organic laws-all necessitate the union of MoldoWallachia, to which those onlyean be opposed who desire to see them divided and weak in order to conquer them, and a few Boyards,wlho induilge in the melarcholyaambition of obtaining at the price of treason the right of raling their expiring country. The question of their *union is supe-ior ts all others relating to tne Principalities. Their union is not only of the last importance to the Puiincipalities, but without their union it is useless to expect them to acquire the defensive force required by their independence and that of the Ottoman empire. " Your Excellency represents the French people, and we have'every confidence in the feelings of the French people. Now that through us the wishes of the Rouniains shalUhave come to the knowledge of your Excellency, our hearts are relieved from a great weight, and we await wvith confidence the decision of the Congress. " Paris, MTarch 9." a (Here follow the signatures of the lHoldo-Wallaecians resident hi Paris.) The Congress met to-day at half-past 1 o'clock at the AMinistry of Foreign Affairs, and remained sittingr some hours. T'lhe Emperor yesterday received Conlt de Razum6f'sky, Chamberlain and Envoy-Extraordinary of the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, who delivered a letter of congratulationi from his Sovereign oii the birtlh of the Prinice Imperial. 'The following was the builletin issued yesterday at the Tuilerics:- " 22D, l.L Fr-PrAS 11 A.N.L-The health of the Empress continues excellent." Thc .eonit-e: .plll.AIL5hes a further list of addresses * It is the intention of tbe G;overnment to red-ace the jiltm.st os thih deabt to 7A per cent. for the f.ture, of congratulation to the Emperor on,tthe birth of the young Piince. Those last received are from the Civil Tribunals of Boulogne-sur-Mer- Bordeaux, and Provins, the Tribunal of Premi§l.-jnstailce of Chatillon-sur-Seine (C8te d'Or) -the Chamber of Avoues of P.uis, the Vnuncil of - Prefecture of the ATeuse, thq :%funicipal C0ridcils of Mlaraeilles, Pau, NisNies, 'Verdun, Ligny; Dieppe, Anzin, La Chatre, and Bayonie ;-the artillery, cavalry, infantry, and fortification committees; the General commanding the 4th IMilitaiy Division; the Geineral Staff of the 4th and 19th Military Divisions; the Imperial Staff School; the officers, functionaries, and pupils of the £pecial Mlilitary School; the Director and person?wl of the Imnperial Ebtablishment of Indret; and the funcetionaries of the Department of the Maine-etLoire. Plince Jerome's iLness yesterday reached its *foul tecnitli day, and his Imperial Higliness's amendment is satisfactory, though slowv. At this period of the complaint, which is that when relapses often take place, the state of the Prince still requires the utiliost precaution.. A Te Dem wvill be performed to-morrow, Easter Sunday, in the Cathedrul of Notre Dame at 1 o'clock, on the occasion of the birth of the Prince ImperiaL Thle ceremony will be terminated by the Pontific,al benediction, given by the Archbiishop of Paris. The Mfinisters, members of the great bodies of the State, antd civil and military authorities,ill be present in full imifo n. The entrance will be by the graud portal of the building. " The French Government," says a Paris letter in the .Tnd6pendance of Brussels,- " Appears to attach real importance to having the bill on the code of 7military justice presented to the legislative body in time to be discussed and voted during the present session, the Emperor liaving expressed a wish to that effeetThe special commission charged to examine the measbure is now actively engaged on its task. It is said that two out of the four boo7ks of which the code iz composed amve been already examined, and are about to be transmitted to the Council of State.

The Opinione of Turin of the 20th inst. announces that the coummittee of the Chamber of Deputies ap pointed to examine the bill on the superior administration of public instruction had chosen 3!i. Buffa for its reporter. The war steamer Prince Eugene of Savoy, of 6 guns and 200 horse-power, was launched at Venice on the 12th, iust. A letter from Rome of the 15th inst. says,- " It has been decided that a special delegate will be sent to Paris in the month of June to baptize the child whose birth is expected by the Emperor of the French. The person hitherto mentioned for that mnission is the CardinalVicar Patrizi. Some progress has been made towards the Eettlement of our railway question. Three companies have offered to execute them on conditions which were referred two days ago to a committee, whose decision is shortly expected. The Roman Chancery is at this moment negotiating an inportant affair, 'vith the prospect of a favourable solution. It had asked to be allowed to appoint bishops to the principal vacant sees in -Poland. The new Emperor replied that His Holinesswasatliberty to namebishopstoall thesees, the Russian Government reservingto itself the right of presentation andL a few other privileges. I am informed that the Courts of St. Petersburg and Rome are on the point of coming to an understanding highly advantageous to the interests of Poland. Whoeverhas visited Rome must have remarked the fine palace of the Cancellaria Apostolica, built by Bramante. It was in that pilace the Roman ConstituentAssemblyheld its sittings, and it wasin its Court Count Rossi was murdered. It has since been converted into a barrack. The Government intends to unite in that building the offices of the different congregations, which are at present dispersed all over the city. A stagecoach was again stopped three days ago on the road between Frosinone and Rome. The passengers were robbed of everything. The brigands even carried away their clothes, after burning what they could not take wvith them. Such facts are so frequent that we do not always mention them. At Rome the number of robberies and the daring of the robbers are truly incredible. This year the Easter festivities are likely to be favoured 'with magnificent weather. The influx of foreigners is extraordinary, and increases every d ay." spAN. (FROM OUR OWN2 COOR S PON DENT.) MADBID, M,&rcu 17. The Cories are now engaged in the discussion of the Budget of Ways and Means, Senor Orense's amendment or separate report as a member of the Budget Committee being under discussion. Senor Orense is at Albaida, and Senor Rivero being prevented from attending in consequence of his being engaged to-day in an affair of honour wvith Senor Sisto Camara, director of the So&era2id, in consequence of a most violent and personal mticle published by the latter yesterday against him, Senor Matheu has taken his place, and was lefb speaking. There will be a long and tedious discussion before the eight amendments or separate reports are disposed of, but the Ministerial plan is expected to pass in the end. The newvs of the accouchement of the Empress Eug6nie was received yesterday, and the Duke de la Vittoria and Minister of Foreign Affairs proceeded at once to visit the French Ambassador and congratulate him on the happy event. There was no Bolsa. yesterday, being Sunday, but the ftnds rose out of doors, and are buoyant to-day. The TIree per Cents. have been done at 40f. lOc. MgAcH 18. The Duke de Ia Victoria repeated in the Congress yesterday the declaration which the Finanee Minister had made before to the Committee on the Budget-that he had the authority of the whole MIinistry to state that the passing of his financial plan was a Cabinet question, and that its rejection would be followed by the retirement of all the Ministers, including the Duke himself. Notwithstanding this explicit declaration, however, the statement did not meet with general belief, as is shown by the many amendments, or separate votes sent in, all with one exception from the Progressista side, and several of them signed bypersons who were present at the meeting on Sunday, where the resolution declaring that Espartero was their only chief was agreed to. Such parties are not likely now to persist in a course which may lead to the retiuement of the latter, and it is hoped, therefore, that such amendments will be withdrawn, and the debates on the Budget be thereby considerably shortened. The Duke observed, in iuaking the above declaration, that the Cortes had approved the estimates of expenditLre, and that it was therefore necessaly that they shouild vote the ways and means to meet tlien; and he trusted that they would approve the Ministerial plan without prejudice to any amendnients whichi they might consider it requisite to make, but always on condition that the amount voted should be the same. He said it should l;e taken into account that the present financial measure could] only be considered as a provisional one, and that with the increase of credit and of the revenues and the pr6spective abolition of the tobacco and salt monopolies, but niore particularly from the increase of credit, which would enable them to get rid of the floating debt,> the time wvould coine when it would be necessary. and indispensable to make a radical arrangement of the whole revenue systemu. He tru sted that the Cortes would adopt the Ministerial scheme as the only one' eligible at the moment to give the Government the I resdurces required, and concluded by saying that, while the Alinisters would respect whatever decision the Cortes should come to, they would all resign if that decision was in the negative. This may be considered as essentially settling the question. - There may be many speeches made and much time lost before the .Uinisterial bill will be canried, and some modifications may be made in it, but all the_amendments will either be withdrawn or rejected,'and- such Progressista deputies as are not prepared to vote with the Government will probably abstaini from voting at all. * The debate on Senor Orense's roto particular ter iniatedin its rejection by-an immense majority; that gf Senior Alfonso is underdiscussionto-day. The Municipal and Provincial Bases Bill was finally passed. Senor Gaminda announced an interpellation for Saturday next, respecting certain persons having unduly assumed abroad the name of .the Spanish Cr6dit MNobilier without any authority to do so from the Cortes,wlhichlhad onlyauthorized one association, tllat of Mlessrs. Pereiue, Duclere, O'Shea, &c.,* touse that name. 5 r.Er I The amendment of Senor Alfonso on the Budget question is under discussion, and will be rejected before the close of the sitting, after which the Assembly will meet in sections. ThelProgressista Deputies will meet to-night in order to come, if possible, to some agreement onthe financial question, so that the different amendments introduced from that side may be withdrawn, and a measure be adopted by common consent which may be acceptable to the Government. The members of the third party, or Centro Parlamentario, will also hold a meeting tonight. The Three per Cents. were done to-day at 40 10 and 40, and the Deferred at 39 90. Bank shares are lower in consequence of the high prices causing some large holclrs to realize; they are quoted at 117. * I hear that the attempt alluded to is likely to lead to legal proceedimgs on the part of the Credit 1Mohilier here.
A3MATEUR MILITARY CRITICISM. 4-- TO THE EDITOR.OF THE THIS. Sir,-Had not Captain Anson sought to bequeath to me as a parting gift a number of inaccuracies for which I certainly am not answerable, I should willingly have acceded to his request that all further discussion respecting his appointment and what had been said about it might terninate. But when Lord Lichfield arraigned the accuracy of my statements concerning his brother, and corrected them by counter-statements of his own, I felt bound, considering the source from which they emanated, to place implicit faith in them. I did so. Captain Anson then comes forward and denounces those very counter-statements as also erroneous, and seelks to fasten them upon me. I decline to accept the responsibility, slight though it be. It was Lord Lichfield, not I, -who said that Captain Anson retumed from the Crimea in June, instead of iU JuLly, 1855; it was Lord Lichfield who stated that the occasion of his return was his exchange from one battalion into another, and who declared that had not such exchange taken place his brother would never have accepted an appointment in India. These are all utterly trumpery points, in no way bearing onthe mainquestion at.issue-staff jobbing -or, indeed, on any other question; but, as they have been gravely marshalled forth to prove that I am an ignorant blunderer, incapable of mastering the great military mystery, I cannot allow the trick, stae and shallow though it be, to escape unnoticed. I regret that Captain Anson should have imagined that I meaut in any vay to sneer at his services. He has been but a short time in the army, and his term of active service has been brief; but it so happens that I had heard from unquestionable witnesses among his comrades that, during that short but severe term of service, no young officer of the Rifles had done his duty more cheerfully and gallantly than Lieutenant Anson; and it would, indeed, hare been unpardonable had I written aught to imply the contrary. Captain Auson, writing from lie bright side of his profession-a captain after 26 months' servitude, with the recollection of his uncle's facile military career to cheer him on-says, "Surely' ATaxpayer' must agree that the Horse Guards were right in facilitating my oxchange into the 84th, as by so doing the 2d battalion of the Rifles obtained the services of a captain of 14years' standing at an important period instead of one of three years." If Captain Anson had been a captain of 14 years' standing, wrho had served a good space of that time in tropical and unhealthy climes, whose promotion would have been assured, and whose finances would have been recruited by the appointment thus jobbed away to a nephew from Earope, I much doubt whether he would have discussed the transaction in such a jaunty and pleasant spirit. I see that I have been a good deal abused by the Ministerial press for presurming to impute blame to the Horse Guards m this and in sumilar matters. They aver that the Horse Guards have nothing on earth to do with staff appointments, which are left entirely to the generals in command; and that if those officers find it pleasanter to surrolwad themselves with a family circle than with mere men of experience, acquirement, and ability, it would be hard, indeed, to deny them that solace. To this I reply, that if the Horse Gaards-consisting now of the Miunister of War and the Commander-in-Chief-choose to delegate their powers to subordinate officers, they are none the less amenable to public censure if those powers are misused. I have no doubt that it is pleasant for a general to collect his own and his brothers' and sisters' sons around him, to see them deEcately dieted and comfortably housed, while their less fortunate comrades shiver in bell tents and masticate ration beef; to secure for them the promotion which is the just due of others who have faced tenfold the- danger and endured twentyfold the hardship to which the staff has been exposed; but, in my view, standing armies ought to be maintained solely for the service of tne State, and not to gratify the domestic affections of indulgent fathers andpartial uncles. As for the assurance that the military authorities at home never interfere in staff appointments abroad, we all remember "Dovwb." * Our military rulers, who have seciured to themselves this monopoly of the prizes of the service for theirrelatives andfriends, arenot verylikelytoundertake the reform of any of the abuses by which they profit so largely. They are, as they ought to be, well satisfied with things as they are. If the army has suffered through the inexperience or incapacity of the staff-if life has been wasted and treasure squandered; on the other hand, Tom has got his lieutenant-colonelcy unattached in a suprisingly short time, and Dick, a very earlymajor of 1855, and a C.B., has been enabled to retlunhome, and vilify the correspondent of 27e Times in all the military clubs in London, long before his regimental seniors, neither majors nor C.B.'s, fought and fell at the Redan. The work;ing officers of the army-the men who spent six nights out of ten inthe snowy trenches-the surgeons who were called upon to treat their patients without medicines, fuel, light, or shelter, dare not plead openly against the abuses of the service-they would be ruined men if they did. And we have recently seen, in General Hall's case, a commanderin-chief formally forbidding a corps of officers to proceed against one by whom they had good reason to believe a grievous wrong had been done, and actially commanding them not even to dare to speak about the miatter, lest the Horse Guards should be discredited in the eyes of the nation. It is clear, therefore, that if any reforms are to take place in the military profession thley must be produced by pressure from without. And it behoves the civilians who urge them to do so in a most guarded and circumspect manner, especially if they have, or intend to have, sons or brothers in the army, for our military rulers are po-werful and in the wrong, and, consequently, I fear, very vindi2ctive. All these considerations will, I hope; in some degree excuse me for persisting to shelter myself under the commonplace aesignation of " A Taxpayer" in my future communications with you; my critics will, I am certain, be more indulgent, when they reflect that military men dare not plead for militaryreform under pain of the displeasure of the Horse Guards, and that the best informed and mostcarefulciviliansareexposedindiscussingmilitary questions, to be occasionally betrayed into technical errors, of no real importance, perhaps, but, according to the angry class who expect to profit by the endurance of existing abuses, deliberate calumnies of the basest dye. I gm, Sir, your obedient servant, A rAAAZ.
