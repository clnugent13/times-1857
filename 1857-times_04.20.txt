I BUDDIIST PILGBJMS. (Continued from Ti Times of April 17.) Hiouen-Thsang born in Chins moro than a thousand years sdter the death of Buddha, was a believer in BuddhisLm. He dedicated his whole life to the study of that religion; travelling from his native country to India, visiting every place mentioned in Buddhist history or tradition, acquiring the ancient language in which the canonical books of the Buddhists were written, studying commentaries, discussing points of difficulty, and defending the orthodox faith at public councils against disbelievers and schismatics. Buddhism had grown and changed since the death of its founder, but it had lost nothing of its vitality. At a very early period a proselytizing apirit awoko among the disciples of the Indian reformer-an element entirely new in the history of ancient religions, except that which is the exception to all religions,-the Mosaic. There in later times weresd of Pharisees who compassed sea and land to make one proselyte, but no Greek, no Roman, no Brahman over thought of converting people to his own national form of worship. Relgion was looked upon as private or national property. It was to be guarded against strangers. The most sacred names of the gods, the pravers by which their favour could be gained, were kept secret. No reEigio however, wras more exclusive than that of the Braluanals. A Brahman was born, nay, twice born. He could not be made. Not even the lowest castes, that of the Sudras, would open its ranks to a stranger. Here lay;the secret of Buddha's success. He addressed himself to castes and outcasts. He promised slvation to all; and he commanded his disciples to preach his doctrine in all places and to all men. A sense of duty, extending from the narrow limits of the house, the village, or the country to the widest circle of mankind, 3 feeling of sympathy and brotherhood towards all men,the idea, infact of humanity, were first pronounced by Buddha. In theathird Buddhist Council, the acts of which have been preserved to us in the Mahvansa, we hear of missionaries being sent to the chief countries beyond India. This council took olace 246 B.C., 310 years after the death of Budha, under the famous King Asoka, whose edicts have been preserved to us on rock Inseriptionz in vaiious parts of India. Those who have no time to read the learned and voluminous works of the late E. Burnouf on Buddhism, his Introduction d CR-Wtoire du Buddhism, and his translation of Le Lots de lo bonse Loi, wil find a very interesting and lucid acco-ut of these councils, and edicts, and missions, and the history of Buddhism in general, in a work lately published by Mrs. Speir, Life in Ancient India. Buddhism spread in the south to Ceylon, in the north to Cashmeer, the malayan countries, Thibet, and China. One Buddhist missionary is mentioned in the Chinese annals as early as 217 B.C.; and about the year 120 B.C. a Chinese General, after defeating the barbarous tribes north of the Desert of Gobi, brought back as a trophy a golden statue-the statue of Buddha. It was not, however, til the year 65 A.D. that Buddhism was officiaUy recognized by the Emperor Ming-ti as a third State religion in China. Ever since it has shared equal honours with the doctrines of Confucius and Lao-tse, in the Celestial Empire, and it is but lately that these three established religions have had to fear the encroach. ments of a new rival in the creed of the Chief of the rebels. After Buddhism had been introduced into China, the first care of its teachers was to translate the sacred works from Sanskdit, in which they were originallywritten, into Chinese. We read of the :Emperor Ming-ti, of the dynasty of Ean, sending TsaN-in and other high officials to India, in order to study there the doctrine of Buddha. They engaged the services of two learned Buddhis^ts, Mani.nga and Tohou-fa-lan, and some of the most important Buddhist works were translated by them into Chinese. 17ie Life of Buddha, the Lalita-vistara, a Sanskrit work which, on account of its style and language, had been referred by Oriental scholars to a much more modern period of Indian literature, can now safely be ascribed to an ante-Christian era, for it was translated into Chinese, as one of the canonical books of Buddhism, as early as the year 76 A.D. The same work was translated also into Thibetan and an edition of it-the first Thibetan work printed in Europe-published in Paris by xL E. Foucaux, reflects high credit on that distinguished scholar, and on the Government which supports these studies in the most liberal and enlightened spirit. The intellectual intercourse between the Indian peninsula and the northern continent of Asia remained uninterrupted for many centuries. Missions were sent from Chin to India to report on the political and geographical state of the country, but the chief ohject of interest wh1ich attracted publio embassies and private pilgrims across the Himalayan mountains was the religion of Buddha. India was for a time the Holy Land of China. There lay the scene of the life and death of the great teacher; there were the mnonuments commemorating the chief events of his life; there the shrines, where his relics might be worshipped; there the monasteries, where tradition had preserved his sayings and his doings; there the books where his doctrine might be studied in its original purity; there the schools where the tenets of different sects Which had sprungupinthe courseof time mightbest beacquired. Some of the pilgrims and envoys have left us the accounts of their travels, and, in the absence of anything like a historical literature in India itself, these Chinese works are of the utmost importance for gaining an insight into the social, political, and religious history of that country from the be,inning of our era to the time of the Mohammedan conquest. The Importance of Mohammedan writers, so far as they treat on the history of India during the middle ages, was soon recognized, and in a memoir lately published by the most eminent Arabic scholar of ffrance, M. Reinaud, new and valuable historical materials have been collected-materials doubly valuable in India, where no native historian has ever noted down the passing events of the day. But, although the existence of similar documents in Chinese was known, and although menof thehigheat literary eminence-such as Humboldt, Blot, and others-had repeatedly urged the necessity of having a translation of the early travels of the Chinese pilgrims, it seemed ahnost as if our euriosity was never to be satisfied. France has been the only country where Chinese scholarship has ever flourished, and it was a French scholar, Abel Remusat, who undertook at last the translation of one of the Chinese Pilgrins. Remusat died before his work was published, and his translation of the travels of Fa-hian, edited by M. Landresse, remained for a long time without being followed up by any other. Nor did the work of that eminent scholar answer aU expectations. Most of the proper names-the names of countries, towns, mountains, and riverm, the titles of books, and the whole Buddhistic phraseology were so disguised in their Chinese dress that it was impos. sible to discover their original form. The Chinese alphabet was never intended to represent the sound of words. It was in its origin a hieroglyphic system, each word having its own graphic representative. Nor would it have been possible to write Chinese in any other way. Chinese is a monosyllabic language. No word is allowed more than one consonant and one vowel,-the vowels including diphthongs and nasal vowels. Hence the possible number of words is extremely small and the num- oer or signiucative sounds in the Chinese language is said to be no more than 450. No language, however, could be satisfied with so small a vocabulary, and in Chinese, as in other monosyllabic dialects, each word, as it was pronounced with various accents and intonations, was made to convey a large number of menig; so that the total number of words, or ra ther of ideas, expressed in Chinese, is said to amount to 43,496. hen ce a graphic re- presentation of the mere sound of word s would have been perfectly useless, and it was absolutely necessary to resort to hieroglyphical writing, enlarged by the introduction of determiu&. tive signs. Te whole immense dic tionary of Chinese, withthe exception of perhaps one-thirtieth part, consists of combined signs, one part indicating the general sound, the other deterninig its speciai meaanig. With such a system Of writing it was psssible to represent Chinese, but i:mpossible to convey either the sound or meaning of any other language. Besides some of the most common sounds, -such as r, b, d, and the short a-are unknown in Chium hinese. H ow, then, were the translt to render Sanskrit namea in Chinese? Tlhe most rational plan would have been to select as many Chinese signs as I there were San skkrt letters, and to express one and the same letter in Sansly rit always by one and the same sign in Chinese ; or, if the conception of a consonant without a vowel and of a vowel without a cons onant was too m nuch for a Chinese understanding, to express at least the same syllabic sound in Sanlkril, by one and the samesyllabio sign inChinoso. A&uimilar system is adopted at tho prewnt day, when the Chinesw find themselves under the nooessity of writing the names of Lord Palmerston or Sir John B3owing; but, instoad of adopting aDy definite lystem of transcribing, each translator seems to have chosen hils own m gns for rendering tho sounds of Sanskrit words, *nd to havo choHen thomn a*. random. The result iB that every Sanskrit word in the translation of the Chineso Buddhists is a riddlo which no ingenuity is able to solve. Who could have snosed that " Fo-to," or moro froquiontlv " Fe,'T was meant for Buddiha I~ KEo-loKkeol-lo- for Rthula, the son, of Buddha? "Po-lo-nai" for Benares ? " Hang-ho" for Ganges?t " Niopan" for NirvB.na? "COha-men" for Sramaua? " Fio for Veda? "Tcha-li" for Kshattriya? "S,iu-tolo" for Sudra? " Fan," or " Fan-lon.mo" for Brahma ? Sometimes, it is truo, the Chinese endeavoured to give, besides tho sounds, a transation of the meaning of the Sanskrit words. But the translation of proper names is always vory precarious, and it requ3red an intimate knowledge of Sanuriit and Buddhist literature to recognize from these awkward translations the exact form of the proper names for which they were intended. If, in a Chinese translation of Thw-ydides we read of a person called " leader of the people," we might guess his name to have been T)e-maigo9,, or Laoegos, as well as Agesilaom. Tedious as these details may seem, it was almost a duty to state them, in order to give an idea of the difficulties which M. Staniss Julien had to grapple with. Oriental scholars labour under great advantages. Few people take an interest in their works, or, if they do, they simply accept the results, but they are unable to appreciate the difficulty with which these results were obtained- Many persons who have read the translation of the Cuneiform Inscriptions are glad, no doubt, to have the authentic and contemporaneous records of Darius and Xerxes. But if they followed the process by which scholars such as Grotefend, Burnouf, Isen, and Rawlinson arrived at their reults, they would ee that the discovery of the alphabet, the language, the grammar, and the meaning of the inscriptions of the Achaemenian dynasty deserves to be classed with the discoveries of a Kepler, a Newton, or a Faraday. In a similar manner the mere translation of a Chinese work into French seems a very ordinary performance; but xL Staisas Julien who has tong been acknowledged as the first Chinese scholar m urope, had to spend 20 years of incesut labour in order to prepare himself for the task of trandating the Travels ofe Hiou ag. He had to learn Sanskrit, no very easy language; he had to study all thle Buddhist literature written in Sanskrit, Pali, Thibetan, Mongolian, and Chinese. He had to make vast indices of every proper name connected with Buddhism. Thus only could he shape his own tools, and accomplish what at last he did accomplish. If there are but few who know the difficulty of a work like that of . Stanila Julien, it becomes their duty to speak out, though, after all, perhaps the most intelligible eulogium would be, that in a branch of study where there are no monopolies and no patents, M. Staniss Julien was the only man in Europe who could produce the article 'which he has produced in the work before Us We shall devote the rest of our space to a short account of the life and travels of Eiouen-thsang. Hiouen-thsang wa born In a provincial town of China, at a time when the empire was in a chronic state of revolution. His father had left the public aerviCe, and had given moat of his time to the education of his four children. Two of them distinguished themselves at a very early age-one of them Hiouen-thsang, the future traveller and theologian. The boy was sent to school to a Bncddhist monastery, and, after receiving there the necessary instrlction, partly from his elder brother, he was himself admitted as a monk at the early age of 13. During the next seven years the young monk travelled about with his brother from place to place, in order to follow the lectures of some of the most distinguished professors. The horrors of war frequently broke in upon his quiet studies, and forced him to seek refuge in the more distant provinces of the empire. At the age of 20 he took priess orders, and had then already become famous by his vast knowledge. He had studied the chief canonical book of the Buddhist faith, the records of Buddha'c life and teaching, the xystem of ethics and mietaphysics; and he was versed in the works of Confucius and Ltee. But still his own mind was agitated by doubts. Six. years he continned his studies inthechiefplacesof learning in China, andwherehe came to learn he was frequently saked to teach. At last, when he saw that none, even the most eminent theologians, were able to give him the information he wane,he formed his resolve of traveling to India. The works of earlier pilgrims were known to him. He knew that in India he should find the originals of the works which in thir Chinese transltion left so many things doubtful in his mind ; and though he knew from the same source the dangers of his journey, yet " the glory, as he says, of recovering the Law, which was to be a guide to all men and the means of their salvation, seemedto him worthy of imitation." In common with several other priests, he addressed a memorlal to the Emperor to ask leave for their journey. Ieave was refused, andthe courage of his companions failed. Not that of HIiouenthsang. His own mother had told him that, soon before she gave birth to him, she had seen her child travelling to the Far West in search of the Law. He was himself haunted by imilar dreams, and, having long surrendered worldly desires, he resolved to brave all dangers, and to risk his life for the only object for which he thought it worth while to live. He proceeded to the YeUow River, the Hoang-ho, and to the place where the caravans bound for India used to meet, and, though the Governor had sent strict orders not to allow any one to crows the frontier, the young priest, with the assitance of his co-religlonists, succeeded in escaplng the vigilance of the Chinese " dousniers." Spies were sent after him. But so frank was his avowal, and so fim his resolution, which he expressed in the presence of the authorities, that the Governor himself tore his hue and cry to pieces, and allowed hun to proceed. Hitherto he had been accompanied by two friends. They nowlefthim, and Hiouen-thsang found himself alone, without a friend and without a guide. He sought for strength in fervent prayers. The next morning a person presented himself, offering his services as a guide. This guide conducted him safely for some distance, but left him when they approached the Desert. There were still five watchtowers to be pased, and there was nothing to Indicate the road through the Desert, exoept the hoofmarks of horses and skeletons. The traveller followed this melancholy track, and, though misled by the " mirage " of the Desert, he reached the first tower. Here the arrows of the watchmen would have put an end to his existence and his cherished expedition. But theofficerincommand, himself a zealous Buddhixt, allowed the courageous pilgrim to proceed, and gave hima letters of recommendation to the officers of the next towers. The last tower however was guarded by men inaccessible to bribes and deaf to resuoning. In order to escape their notice Elouen-thsang had to make a long detour. He passed through another desert, andlost his way. The bag in which he carried is water burst, and then even th courage of Eiouen-thsang failed. He began to retrace his steps. But suddenly he stopped. " I took an oath," he said, ",never to make a step backward till I had reached India. Why then have I come here ? It is better I shouldc die proceeding to the westthan return to the east and ive." Four nights and five days he travelled through the Desert without a drop of water. Hle had nothing to refresh himself except his prayers-and what were they? Texts trom a work which taught that there was no God, no Creator, no creation, nothing but mind, minding itself. it is incredible in how exhausted an atmosphere the Divine spark within us will glimmer on, and even warm the dark chambers of the human heart. Comforted by his prayers, Eliouen-thsang proceeded, and arrived after some time at a large lake. Hle was in the ountry of the Oigour Tatars. They received him well, nay, too well. One of the Tatar Kha", himself a Buddhist, sent for the Buddhist pilgrim, and isisted on his staying with him to instrct his people. Remonstrances proved of no avaiL But Hiouen-thsang was not to be conquered. "I know," he said, " that the King, in spite of his power, has no power over my mind and my will ;" and he refused aU nourishment, in order to put an end o his life. Three days he persevered, and at last the Elan, afraid of the consequenesw, was obliged to yield to the poof monk. He made him promise to visit him on his return to China, and then to stay three years with him. At last after a delay of one month, during 'which the Khan and his Court camo daily to hear the lossons of their pious guest, the traveler eontinued his jotuney ithanumeroug escort, and with letters of introciuotion from the Khan to 24 Princes whoso territories the little c&!&van had to passw Their way lay tbrough -what is now callod Daun-I gart2 across tho Musur-dabaghan m(ountains, the northorn portion of the Beltur-ta the Yaxarbm vAlley, Baetria, and Kabulistan- e rilot foUow them through all tho places they passed, though the accountm which he gives of their adventure, are most interesting, and tho desription of the peoDlo most importknt. Here is a description of the M u sur-dabaghat mountains:- " Tho top of the mountnin rises to the sky. Sinco the beginning of tho world the snow has been ocumnulating, and is now transformed into vta mue" of ios, wbich never melt, either itl spring or summer. Hard snd brilliant heets of snow are spread ont till thoy are lost in tho lnfinite, and mindle -with the oloudd. If one looks at tbem , the eyes aro da7z cd by the splendour. Frozen peaks bang down ovor beith sides of the road, simo 100 feet high, and 20 feet or 80 feet large. It Ig not withont diffioulty and danger that the traveller cLn clear them or climb over them. Besidos thero are squall, of wind, and tornadoes of *now which atitk tho pilgrims. Even with double shoes and in thick furs one cannot help trembling and shivering." 3uring the soven days that Hiouen-thsang crosed these Alpine pases he lost 14 of his companions. What is most important however, in this early portion of tho Chinese traveher in tho acoount which he gives of tho high degreo of civilization among the tribes of Central Asia. We had gradually accustomeed ourselves to beliovo m an early civilization of Egypt, of Babylon, of China, of India; but now that we find the hordes of Tatary possessing in the seventh century the chief arts and institutions of an advanced society we shal soon have to drop the name of barbarians altogether. The theory of 'A Oppert, who ascribes the original invention of the cuneiform letters and a civilization anterior to that of Babylon and Nineveh to a Turanian or Scythian race will lose much of its apparent improbability. In the Ingdom of Okini, on the western frontier of China, Niouen-thsang found an active oommerce, gold, silver, and copper coinage, monasteries, where the chief works of Buddhism were studied, and an alphabet derived from Sanskrit. As he travelled on he met with mines, with agriculture, including pears, plums, peaches, almonds, grapes, pormegra. nates, rice, and wheat. The inhabitanta were dressed in silk and woollen materials. There were musicians in the chief cities who played on the flute and the guitar. Buddhism was the prevailing religion, but there were traces of an earlier worship, the Bactrian fire-worship. The country was everywhere studded with halls, monasteries, monuments and statues. Samarkand formed at that early time a kind of Athens, and its manners were copied by all the tribes in the neighbourhoodx Balkh, the old capital of Bactria, was still an important place on the Oxus, wel fortified, and full of sacred buildings. And the details which our traveler gives of the exact circumference of the cities, the number of their inhabitants, the products of the soil, the articles of trade, can leave no doubt in our minds that he relates what he had seen and heard himself. A now page in the history of the world is here opened, and new ruins pointed out which would reward the pickaxe of a Iayard. But we must not linger. Our traveller, as we said, had entered India by way of KabuL He proceeded to Kashmir, visited the chief towns of Western and Central India, and arrived at last in Magadha, the Holy Land of the Buddhists. Here he remained five years, devoting all his time to the study of Sanskrit and Buddhist literature, and inspecting every place hallowed by the zecollections of the past. He then passed through Bengal, and proceeded to the South, with a view of visiting Ceylon, the chief seat of Buddhism. Baffed in that wish, he crossed the peninsula from east to west, ascended the Malabar coast, reached the Indus, and, after numerous excursions to the chief places of North-WVesternIndia, returned to Magadha, to spend there, with his old friends, some of the happiest years of his hfe. The route of his journeyings is laid down in a map drawn with exquisite sidll by M. Vivien de Saint Martin. At last he was obl ged to return to China,and, passing through the Punjab,Kabulistan, and Bactria, he reached the Oxus, followed its course nearly to its sources on the plateau of Pamir, and, after staying some time in the three chief towns of Turkistan, Rhasgar, Tarkand, and Khoten, he found himself again, after 16 years of travels, dangers, and studies in his own native country. Hi fame had spread far and wide, and the poor pilgrim, who had once been hunted by imperial spies and armed policemen, was now received with public honours y the Emperor himself. His entry into the capital was like a triumph. The streets were covered with carpets, flowers were scattered and banners flying. Soldiers were drawn up, the magistrates went out to meet him, and all the monks of the neighbourhood marched along in solemn procession. The trophies that adorned this triumph, carried by a large number of horses, were of a peculiar kind. First, 150 grains of the dust of Buddha; secondly, a golden statue of the great Teacher; thirdly, a similar statue of sandal-wood; fourthly, a statue of sandal-wood, representing Buddha as descending from heaven; ffthly, a statue of silver ; sixthly, a golden statue of Buddha conquering the dragons; seventhly, a statue of sandal-wood representing Buddha as a preacher; lastly, a collection of books, consisting of 657 works in 520 volumes. The Emperor received the traveller in the Phcenix Palace, and, full of admiration for his talents and wisdom, invited him to accept a high office in the Government. This Hiouen-thsang declined. " The soul of the administration," he said, " is still the doctrine of Confucius ;" and he would dedicate the rest of his life to the Law of Buddha. The Emperor thereupon ask-ed him to write an account of his travels, and assigned him a monastery where he might employ his leisure in translating the works he had brought back from India. travels were soon written and published, but the translation of the Sanskrit MSS. occupied the whole rest of his life. It is said that the number of works translated by him, with the assistance of a large staff of monks, amounted to 740, in 1,335 volumes. Frequently he might be seen meditating on a difficult passage, when suddenly it seemed as if a higher spirit had enlightened his mind. His soul was cheered, as when a man walking in darkness sees aU at once the sun piercing the clouds and shining in its full brightness; and, unwilling to trust to his own understanding, he used to attribute his knowledge to a secret inspiration of Buddha and the Bodhisatvas. When he felt that the hour of death approached, he had all his property divided among the poor. E[e invited his friends to come and see him, and to take a cheerful leave of that impure body of Hiouen-thsang. "I desire," he said, "that whatever merits I may have gaied by good works may fall upon other people. 7ay I be born with them again in the heaven of the blessed, be admitted to the family of Mi-le, and serve the Buddha of the future, who is full of kindness and affection. When I descend again upon earth to pass through other forms of existence, I desire at every new birth to fulfil my duties towards Buddha, aud arrive at last at the " bighest and most perfect intelligence." Hae died in the year 664. It is impossible to do justice to the character of so extraordinary a man as Hiouen-thsang in so short a sketch as we were able to give. If we knew only his own account of his life and trave'-the volume which has just been published at Paris-we should be ignorant of the motives which guided him and of the sufferings which he underwent. Happily, two of his friends and pupils had left an account of their teacher, and m.Stanislas Julien has acted wisely in beginn his collection of the Buddhist Pilgrims with the trauslation of that biography. There we learn something of the man hinself and of that silent enthusiasm which supported him in his arduous work. There we see him braving the dangers of the desert, scrambling along glaciers, crossing over torrents, and quietly submitting to the brutal violence of Indian Thugs. There we see him rejecting the tempting invitations of Khans, Kings, and Emperors, and quietly [pursuing among strangers, within the bleak walls of the cell of a Buddhist college, the study of a foreign language, the key to the sacred literature of his faith. There we see him rising to eminence, acknowledged as en equal by his former teachers, as a superior by the most distinguished scholars of India; the champion of the orthodox faith an arbiter at councils the favourite of Indian ungs. In his own work there is hardly a word about all this. We do not wish to disguise his weaknesses such as they appear in the same biography. Ee was a credulous man, easily imnosed upon by crafty priests, sti more easily cared away by his own superstitions; but he deserved to have lived in bettertimes, and we almodtgrudge xohighand noble a character to a country not our own, and to a religion unworthy of such a mnan. Of selfishness we fldnotram in him. Rliowhole life be- longed to the faith in which he was bomn, nd t obiect of his labeurs was ndt o much to perfect hixl.

We have had several opportunities of pointing out the creditable manna in which that body has Patronized literay and scientific works connected with the Eut, and we congratulate the Chairman, Colonel Sykes, and the President of the Board of Control, Mr. Vernon Smith, on the excellent choice they have m2de In this instance.

XQZTALIrZAION OP THE POOBR-ATE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIS. Sir,-For the accrcY of my statement as to the poorrnb assessment of llington, St. Mary, impeached by your eorre. gpondent, W. T ," I beg to refer him to the Blue-boo2 printedbyorderof theHoseof Commonson the2dof Yarchr, 1854, page 137, where the following entry occuts .-c" Eat. able value of property asesed to the poor's-rate for tbi Year ended the 25th of Msrch, 1852 -Ilington, S Mary 372,3812." And this satement is confirmed by "c return made to the House of Commons April 30, 1855, of the rate. able value of property in Loudon, Westminster, FinaburW, &c., page 18," where it is stated that " the propertyvalue of Islington, St. Mary, is 549,773L, and the poor-rate assfesment 372,3811" If thero be a more reoent and more correct assessment ot the paish than the one returned above I am not awar of it, and shAl be gld to correct any error that may hava ccurred in my statement through the want of informatioa which may possibly be known toparochial officials, bat not to the public generally. And now a word or two respecting the letters of the "East-end Churchwarden," and the " West-end Apothe. cary," which appered in T7 Time of yesterday. They both admit the nzutice and the necessityof an equal asomment, as well as the advantage of an equal rate, though they both think that the property-tax valuation might be improvedupon. Perhapa it may; but I am of opinion that this merely a matter of detail, which may well be left tiU the principle of equalization ig more firmly estblished in the public mind. It is, however, a strong proof of the general equity of the property-tax assessment that, though there have been thoussnds of appeals against income. tax asseennente, therehave been but very few indeed gainst the property-tax sesment under Schedule A; ndwve may be quite sure that the people of Paddington, and the inhabltants of those unions where the dlacrepancy be4 tween the property-tax and the poor-rate values is so great, would never have submitted to smch an enbanod amount of taxation when a socesfnl appeal might have been so easily made if it had justice on its aide. If either of your correspondents have any better mode of assessment to propose, the public will, no doubt, gladly hear them through your inluentil columns; if they have not, let them use, as I would, those that are made redy tX our hand. The principle of Poulett Scrope's Act, quoted by the "West-end Apotheca," is the principle of the property tax aessment, and the only fair one for such a purpoec; it is totally different from the usual practice prevalent throughv out the metropolis,-a practioe which, as I have shown, rates some unions above the rack-rent, and others 50 per cent. below it. It may be well to inquire the reason why such unions as Bethnal-green, Bermondsey, St. George's Et andWhitechapel are so highly assesed to the poor, and the rich parishes of St. George's,Eanover-square,and Paddington are asessed so much below the real value. I think it will be found in the fact that human nature, when oppressed with a burden too heavy to be carried with comfort, endeavours to shift it off upon other shoulders, or, at any Mte, stive5 to make others, where it has the power, bear an equal share. Hence, the burden in the poorest parishes be-ir being very oppressive, no portion of property is permitted in auch parishes to escape from its equal proportion. The rack-rent, then, is generally taken in the poorest paishes; all suffer alike, and so the struggling tradesman in such a locality knows that if the rates and taxes tink him into rain they will inevitably do the same with his neighbourt in the like position. On the other hand, when the burden Is light, as in the rich parishes of the city and west-end, the rate becomes a mere bagatelle; there is no anticipation Oe any pressure for the support of the poor, who have probably been expelled from such parishes; an assessment of 50 per cent., perhaps, below the actual value is agreed to; anl hence the glaring inequality. I bave not taken up this question, Sir, from any motives of a personal nature,but simplybecauseI feel a deep interest in the poor of my own district (which contains a population of 13,000 souls) and neighbourhood, and m satisfied' that the ratepayers of that neighbourhood cannot supply their wants, and that therefore if the peace and harmony of London is to be preserved, the rich parishes must come for' ward and assist the poor ones, even if it should be at a lite personal sacrifice, and a little deprecition of the value Of their now unfairly exempted property. That this opinion of mine is participated in by nearly all the working clergy of the distressed eastern suburbs of London is evidenced by the fact that in the Deanery of Stepney, to whichI belong, four-fifths of the incumbents-representing. population of 308,000 souls-have already signed a petition to the Legislaturs for the equalization of the poor-rate throughout the metropolis, and I fuUy hope and trust that their impartial and unbiased conviction will receive at the hands of those in authority that attention which it deserveL I am, Sir, yours. &c..

COIUNT PISANI AND THE AUSTmPI TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir-It is stated in yonr aper of Thursdy. on the strength of a letter from Venoe, tht Count Pisani hba been fined 700,000 livres by the Civil Lieutenant for sellinz the Paul Veronese picture, called "l. Tenda di Dario,s to the British Government. Now, the world loo}s justlv to Vie !Zimes for correct information, and it is precisely because I feel convinced that the above is quite the reverse that I take the liberty of troubling you 'wth the. lines. There is no law or regulation in Austrian Italy which would authorize the Infliction of a fine on any proprietor of works of art for disposing of the same without authority from the Government to do so. In order to prevent the indiscriminate 8ale and removal of masterpieces there is a regulation prohibiting the exportation of any work of art from Venieo without its beng first suamitted to the Academy of Fine Arts and the snction of that body ob. tained for its removal. The Government has in this way the power of saying-" You have purchaved such a picture of count Pisani, or any other proprietor; well And good; but you must not take it away from Venine until we grant you an act{ and this is generallyaPecunmmtter A simils rquiaton exists gener aay theughout Italv bAt nowhere is there a fie *tt ched to the selling what is one's own property. Moreover, it wa8 spocially mentioned in The mec a while ago that our representitive had had to exerise sa his tact and influence to obtain the requiite permisson for the exportation of this famous Paul Veronese. The state. ment in the letter quoted by your Paris correspondent evi. dently belongs to the inventive imagination of the writer No Austrian authority, after the Emperor's late manifeeta. tion of goodwill towards his Italian subjects, would dae to comImit such an at as is imputed to the Civil Lieutenant: nor wonld it be credible (supposing there existed a law to sanction it), vhen we recollect that the purchaer is the British Government Besides, it is notorious that that picture has been on ale for years.

pION.EY-MABKBTandCITYINTELLIGBNCE. Saturday Evening. The English funds opened this morning at the prices touched after regular hours yesterday on the news of the intention of the Bank of France to resume their artificial purehases of gold on their recent high terms. Subsequently the market remained steady, the pressure for money being less severethan at any period during the last week or two, and the fnal quotations showed a fractional recovery. The long-delayed Russian Railway scheme, which may be viewed as an attempt to get the greater part of jorty-five millions sterling from this country, to be controlled by Russian officials and Parisian capitallsts and speculators, although the first step is on a more moderate and general scale, was issued late in the day, but was appsrently received with indifference. The first transactions in Consols were at 921 to3gfor money and 93 tokfortheaccount, and the last quotations were 92i for money and 93 to i for the account. Bank Stock left off at 212 to 214; IBeduced, 91;E to - ; NewThree per Cents., 92j to j; India-bonds, lOs. to 5s. discount; and Exchequer-bills (June), 10s. to 6s. discount, (March) 7s. to 3B. discount. Although the demand in the discount-market continues active at full rates, it was met to-day by a better supply. It is believed that the paymenta faling due at the Bank were very heavy, but that the applications at that eatablishment were not so large and numerous as in the earlier part of the -week. A few small amounts of Australian gold continue to be taken there. Foreign securities were steady at the commencernent of business, but subsequently there was a general decline. The transactions in the official fst were-Turkish Six per Cents., for money, 93k, and for the account, 94 and *; Sardinian Five per Cents., for money, 90*; for the account, 90i; Spah Three per Cents, 42; and the Certificates, and A. i The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 69f. 55c. for money and 69f. 7Oc. for the end of the month, sbowing a further reaction of an eighth. Although the resolution of the Bank of France to continue buying gold at a premium to replace the amounts drawn away from them at par, and which maust be drained in increased quantities just to the extent that they increase their paper issues to pay for these purchases, has caused an adverse change in the Consol-market, the public must bear in mind that the operation can have no permanently disturbing influence. The Bank of France can draw nothing from this country but what they pay for; and, although they may at the moment obtain a supply of gold by buyig up bils on London in the hands of the Paris bankers, or by indirectly causing bills to be manufactured and discounted here, the only result of these proceses is that they anticipate by a few weeks the natural course of the payments between the two countries. If the Paris bankers sell their London biUs to the agents of the Bank of France they have the less to remit for collection on their own account, aud if bills are manufactured and discounted in London for French purposes they must ultimately be provided for by French money. Consequently, if the process straitens us to-day we shall be so much the easier for it a month hence. 4 The Bank of France, on the contrary, are getting ease now at the cost of protracting their difficulties, but -with the hope, it is to be assumed, that something will meanwhile turn up. Thus, if the silk crop should prove favourable, it will probably enable them to face their position more courageously. This mode of banking, however, is one of mere speculation. Supposing another failure of the silk crop or an untoward political or commercial event of any kind, what will then be their course ? If it is the business of a bank to keep itself secure against every contingency, and not by upholding prices beyond the point to which they would naturally fall under an adverse state of the exchanges to promote the interests of the seller against the buyer, the question involves possibilities which the Governors can scarcely contemplate without anxiety. MeEsrs. Baring, Brothers, and Co. have issled their Russian Railway prospectus, and their name is the only English one comprised in the board of direction. The sum they ask from London capitalists out of the 12,000,0001. first to be raised is 2,000,0()01., instead of between 3,000,0001. and 4,000,0001., as originally contemplated. The sum in Paris having likewise been reduced, it is to be presumed an estimate more accurate than that originally entertained has been formed of its probable reception. The statements now put forth fail to modify any of the features already commented upon. The guarantee, after allowing for sinking fund, is to be only 4 11-1 2ths per cent., the working expenses, in the face of universal experience, are put as low as 45 per cent., and the difficulty as to crossing the marshes with which the country abounds is simply disposed of by the statement that they"w be avoided by a proper selection of the route." The number of miles to be constructed are 2,585, at a cost of 16,5111. per mile, or about 43,000,0001., and the whole must be made within 10 years. It is not stated in what quarter the extra proportion first intended for London and Paris is now to be allotted. The Prussian public, who are best qualified to form an opinion of the prospects of the enterprise, both commercial and political, are understood to be disposed to limit themselves to the modest amount of 200,0001., or less, although the proposed extension of the Warsaw ine to their own frontier and the intimate business connexions of their bankers and others with St. Petersburg might be supposed to operate in its favour. Upon the Court of St. Petersburg and its agents the duty of making up the deficiency from the failure on this side will therefore apparently fall, and the advices for the next few months will perhaps describe the eagerness with which the merchants of that capital, who usualy never put out their money at a less interest than 10 to 12 per cent., aro seeking to be allowed to contribute. With regard to the prospect of the 2,000,0001. being taken in London it must be inferred that Messrs. Baring, before they issued the prospectus for that reduced amount, were able to calecilate that it could be made up by their own aibscription and that of personal friends who would feel it incumbent on them to afford assistance. The first payment is to be 61. per share, and the period for applications is from the 28th of April to the 5th of May. The contractors stipulate for 6 per cent. of aU profits beyond the guaranteed dividend and siniling fund. The railway meetings of the week have scarcely presented any facts of interest. The inhabitants of Farningham have passed resolutions in favourof an extension of the East Kent line from Strood to St. M-ary Cray, and a deputation has been appointed to wait on Lord Darnley, with the view of urging him to reconsider his determination to oppose the Bill. The report of the Perth and Danukeld Railway is regarded as satisfactory, and it is stated that the claims of landowners, with one exception, have been settled. The balance of revenue will allow of a disibution at the rate of 4 per cent, per annum. The speciearrivals of the week have amounted Ito about S00,0001. The exports have included 739,'7931. by the Indus for ndia and China, and G(),3001. for the West Indies. The Paris letters state that 20 franc pieces have been in demand for exportation to Lombardy, in connexion probably with the speculations in Italian Iailways, to the number of which the Roman concession, involving about three miUions sterling, has now to be added. The French caution money on the Russian project is understood to have been already paid, and the exchange on St. Petersburg bas declned. The new French Spanish loan is expected to be officiaUy quoted next week.

.STlATB OF TBADE. MANCHESTER, Ar'sr 18. The market has been exceedingly quiet this morning. What demand there is in the cloth-market extend" pretty generally to all kinds, both for home consumption and ex. port but most descriptions of fabric are taken only in sm;d quantities. In few cloths are there any stocks of consequence; but the large business doing a little time since in 36-inch shirtings has fallen off a good deal, and these fabrics go off very slowly. For 40-inch shirtings and mogt descriptions of India goods there is sufficient demand to take off the supply at full prices. Domestics, long-cloths, T-cloths, and printers, though only bought stinly, are firm in price. In yarn there is but a sluggish sale for the coarser numbers taken for home co mption, hut most of the fAneriarns and twists for export to Germany andeto India are mi moderate request at the fun rates of Tuesday. BRMI1NGHA^M, Ar'nu 18. Since the termination of the quarterly meetinge nothing has occurred which denotes any mateil alteration in the iron trade. Orders have perhaps been more freely given for the American market than might have been expected, but otherwsne the trade is quiet and steady. The prioe of best mine pigs is well maintained, and this is strong evidence of the demand for best descriptions of manufactured iron. T'here is no change in the rates charged for copper and tin, and little consequent alteration in the manufactures, of which those articles constitute the staple. On Tuesday an attempt was made to reduce the price of copper, but for tin and copper goods, so far as the home trade is concerned, they continue to be extremely limited. There is at present a considerable demand for papier mnach and electro-plate artioles, but these are mostly for exportation. The stringency of the money-market does not produce any very serious inconvenience among the manufacturers. Good commercial paper is, as uual, discounted at a aht advance, but few complaints, under the circumstances, are made against the additional exaction enforced by local bankers. In the neighbouring towns of Coventry, Stourbridge, Dudleq', Wednesbury, Walsall, and other manufacturing localites business continues comparatively active. Contracts among the principal ironfounders are upon the incremse, and at Stourbridge the chain business is busier than usual. At Smethwick, with the exception of the London works, employment is becoming more abundant, and hopes are entertained that the immense establishment of Messrs. Fox and Henderson may in its entirety be yet maintained in the neighbourhcod. Already the neighbourhoDd is suffering greatly by the suspension of the works, although fortunately the increase of trade which has recently occurred in other foundries has in some small degree rup. plied the deficiency. NOTTITCHAIif, Aa'nn. 18. There are great complaints of dulness, both in the laee and hosiery businesses, and not without cause, the constant rise which has taken place in the price of material having so increased the cost of manufactured goods as to check demand. This heaviness, however, is only temporary, as not only can a larger number of people in nearly all oountries afford to wear more lace and hosiery than formerly, but they are for the most part able to pay better prices. LEICESTEB, APsm 18. There is an improvement in the hosiery trade, and a good demand is experienced for cotton articles. Orders have been received from the United States for the falL In worsted goods there is very little doing. lanufacturers ap. pear determined not to make goods, except at prices proportionate to the advance in the raw materiaL In yarns and wools there is no change. LEEgDS, Areur. 18. The woollen cloth trade continues far from brisk; but there are slight indications of improvement. There was a fair attendance of buyers at the cloth halls this morning, and a better feeling prevailed. In goods suitable for the spring and summer seasons more business was tranated, and should fine weather be experienced an impetus will be given to this branch of trade. Some of the shipping houses have been employed in making up considerable orders; but in other departments there has been unusual inactivity for the time of the year. Operatives are not in fall work at present, and some of the mills are id not to be running more than three or four days a-week, In wool, both English and foreign, there has not been much done, and therel a little weakness in the price of the latter. HALIFAX, APReTm 18, This vveek busiaes has been very quiet in yarns of all descriptions, and also in piece goods little has been done. To day there has been greater activity. The stocks of wool are decreasing, and prices are scarcely so firm. NORWICH, APRIL 18. The spring trade here has altogether been a good one, and it is stated that many eriginal patterns for bareges produced in the city have been copied by the French. Considerable quantities of plain paramattas have also been made for exportation to Austria and Turkey, the goods sent to the atter country being dyed Prussian blue to suit Ottoman tastes. The camlet trade, which was once a souroe of great prosperity in Norwich, but which has become almost extinct of late years, has revived, and some quantity has bee made for exportation to Flushing. Fancy goods have been prncipally taken off in the home market but they have also been made to a considerable extent for Axmerica and' Australia. Poplns, notwithstanding a great rise in the pnces of materials, have been in much demand; and a con. siderable trade has been done in crinolines. Messrs. WilMett and Nephew have produced a new mixed fabric. The activity mn the glove trade continues without abatement. DU)BLIN, Arum 17. The Customs' receipts for the week to Thursday, April 9th, inclusive, were 66,2701., against 10,5441. the pre g week. The large increase was received on tea, In consequence of the reduction of duty of 4d. in the lb. BELFAST, AruR 16.

There is not any change to report in Lurgan yoods. ln Baflymana there was a du trade and little passing. LThEQN YARNm.-The demand for tow yarns continues good, but there has been less business in line yarns, without alteration in value. FLAx.-The markets have been poorly supplied with both hand and mill scutched, the quality of which continues coarse. Prices unaltered.

LONDON, MIONDAY, APRIL 20,1857. Four Knights of Suffolk are just starting on a perilous expedition. They have been girded and armed, booted and spurred; and two of them the other day took a stirrup cup from their loving friends at the Town-hall of Bury St. Edmund'. Wrhere the other two have been shriven and blest for the journey it matters not, for they are all four to meet on the road and to stick together. The road is long and beset with unknown perils. Purses have been robbed, lives taken, and, what is worse, many an honest man has been forced into evil companionship. Bat, be that as it may, who can tell whether he will get to his journey's end? Arnd it is weU to be prepared for the worst. The Suffolk Knights don't seem so far to have been worsted. They confess to full pockets and a goodly company, ample " means," and considerable ' power." But, starting from the old King4grm of the East Angles, these descendants, doubtless, of the Danes are about to penetrate into the interior of this island, full of strange raco, customs, and laws. Among other foes, of whom dreadful stories are about, is " what they "cuill Progre." Nobody in Suffolk, not even Sir R. BUXTON, the chief informant in these matters, can say what it is, whether a robber, or a wild beast, or a poisonous plant, or a torrent, or a quagmire, or an ogre, or a magician, or perhaps a OCIBC, not less formidable, though more seductive than all. A- the SufBolk Knlights career on their steeds through the streets of Bury St. Edmund's, or wend their way past abbey and castle, friendly voices exclaim, " Now, whatever you do, " beware of Progress." " Don't be caught "by Progress." " It won't leave you a mark in your bags or a whole bone in your skins." "Don't fall into the clutches of Progress." Of course, by starting early and avoiding night journeys, by proper watching and warding, and making many inquiries about the character of the country, they may make themiselves tolerably safe against the monster. But there are miscreants in league with Progreas, very plausible folk, who engage the unwary traveller in conversation, and by false relations lure him into the very castle, or whatever it is, of Progress. There are Free Lances who rove about under the character of " Independents ;" and there is a still more insidious race, whom it is impossible to describe, say all Suffolk authorities, who call themselves " Liberal-Conservatives." What in the world can that be ? Are there white blackamoors? Who ever heard of a cow flying ? The very namo is an enigma. There cannot really be such a thing as a Conservative who is not a Conservative, or a Liberal who is not a Liberal; so, how can there be a Liberal-Conservative? It must be a rascally disguise of some sort, as the strong sense of Sir R. BUXToN pointed out to the bold squires of his county and their adventurous representatives. There are hideous stories of travellers who have sat down on the trunk of a tree and found it a boa constrictor, or who have approached what seemed a dead body, and found it, to their cost, a live highwayman. SWDBAD landed on a green island, and set about cooking his dinner, but the island proved a whale, and SINDBAD, his cookery, and his companions were speedily afloat. Then, there was once a wooden horse which turned out full of armed soldiers. These warnings have doubtless reached Suffolk, and inspired a just horror of such monstrosities as Liberal-Conservatives. But, besides the monster " Progress," and those hippocentaurs the Liberal-Conservatives, there is evidently another danger from which the four Suffolk Knights and their squires have recently suffered. Dire magicians infect the country with their mischievous delusions, which pervert the simple folk and lead them away from their Conservative duty. A certain China question, the Suffolk people complain, has been much misunderstood and misrepresented, and the result has been to send many old and well-tried champions of their cause into hopeless banishment. What if some other question of the sort should come up, and even Suffoltk should be deluded into " what they call" patriotism and common sense ? But, supposing these four Knights happily set on their journey, and unmolested, for the present, by. Progress, Liberal-Conservatives, China, and their other foes, what is the object of their crusade ? On that point they maintain a judicious reserve. They will have their eyes about them and their wits too. Lord PALISTON must do something, and they will walt to see what he does. When he has started his game, perhaps they may bag it themselves. Then they are threatened with a Reform Bill. This, too, they will wait and see. The last one gave Suffolk four county members. Otherwise all that these bold Knights commit themselves to is to keep all they have and to get what they can. Hlappily, after some 30 years' incessant persecution they don't seem to think themselves so very ill off. They still cry "No surrender' as loudly as if they had all the wealth of the Indies under lock and key. There is a mysterious look about some persons which betrays a comfortable sense of abundant resources, and these Suffolk gentlemen have it. They possess the " means" and the " power," they say, and intend to use their power to maintain and even augment their means. I So the new crusade is to direct itself against certain I hard burdens and oppressive taxation which they I wish to see at least shared by the fundholder. If this idle wight could be dragged from his cavern and made to do his proper work, it would then be easier for the rest; and we are left to infer, from the speech of one of these gentlemen, late member for Bury St. Edmund's, that nobody there present had any share in this lazy, selfish, " great money " interest." Then, as the Children of Israel were taxed both for labour and for straw to build treasure cities, it appears that the patient, though not unprosperous, Suffolk race are taxed-so says this last-named gentleman-to build military depots. This, then, is to be got rid of. But one grand idea eclipses all the rest in the Suffolk imagination, and forms the only positive and picturesque object of this knight-errantry. The new Conservative cry is "Cheap dung." The agriculturists must have their raw material cheap as well as the manufacturers; and, though Mr. OAxEs cannot recommend Government to send and seize guano by force wherever they can find it, he thinks Jxi MAJEsry's Navy might be profitably employed in scouring the ocean everywhere in search of these precious deposits. Why not a step further ? Why stop short at finding the whereabouts of the article ? Instead of falling out with Commissioner YE}r and raising the price of tea, we beg to suggest, as an improvement on the above suggestion, that the Royal Navy should be employed in bringing the guano or any other dung that can be found to our hungry sands; that rank and honour should be awarded in proportion to the quantity obtained and its chymical strength; that G.C.B. should moan in future " Guano Commander of the " Bath ;" and that, failing foreign supplies, the huge flotilla of gunboats lately laid up somewhere might be utilized in conveying to our eastern coasts the valuable products of our metropolitan sewage. "B But by all means let us stick together," is the chief advice these courageous gentlemen offer one another. When they have mustered strong enough, then it v ill be time enough to think what they can do. Their recent disasters have resulted from the splits they have had among themselves; while the foe, though motley, has been united. The present Cabinet, says Captain BaNNET, is, in the words of BURKE, " a tesselated Government, made up of " Courtiers and Republicans." That, by the way, is not such a bad make-up, after all; it is at least better than any Government will ever be that wages war alike with the CROWN and the people, and maintains the interest of one class alone against the general good and the Royal prerogative. If the present is a "tesselated Govern" ment," what is, or rather what was, the Parliamentary Opposition ? But let that pas3. So, " Stick together" is the word. But what will they stick together to or for? This is simply the gregarious instinct. It is common to dogs and to jackalls, that hunt in packs, and to sheep, that go in flocks. It is very useful both for the pursued and the pursuer. We shall know 'where to find these people and how to get at them. Indeed, it saves a great deal of trouble to know that a Conservative, and any one who sets the agricultural interest against others, is only one of a shoal. We know the Mint the man comes from. This knowledge is only too useful to a Minister in difficulties. He has only to offer the interest an easement of its county-rates out of the Exchequer, and he has its votes in his pocket for the remainder of the session. In fact, these four swaggerers, after announcing that their cause is one of principle, and that they expect a conflict with all the Powers of Darkness, tell Government, in a sort of aside, that all they want is a little more money. After donning helmet and cuirass, after brandishing sword and spear, after hymns and orisons, they come to market, cheapening dung, begging off rates, and selling themselves to the man who will give most. Our readers are aware we never thought much better of Conservatism than this, but these Suffolk gentlemen rob the hypocrite of the bit of flimsy that stiU stuck to it. It cornes before ono as vulgar and gros as a fat turkey or a prize turnipgood things in their way, but standing too much on their own merits to ask for encouragement at the sacrifice of other interests. But is this real Suffolk? Why is the county so differenxt from its northern neighbour? Have its squires so sniffed up ivith open nostrils the fragrant air of the sheepfolds as to think of nothing on earth but the dungeart, the ratebook, and diseeaed foreign cattle ? It reminds one of the complaint the fine lady made that she saw little society, "she was so manured up in Cie country;" only these gentlemen have been c" manured up" so long that they can think of nothing else, and are bringing the smel of their farmyards into Parliament. There are worse smells, but a farmer is a farmer, and these people don't fill their dungearts with that heroic air with which some one says a real gentleman would handle a dungfork. For the sake of the country, of green fields, and rustic folk, we could wish them more grace; but they are much as Nature made them, and our statesmen will know how to turn them to the best political accoumt.
At a moment when the provisions of our criminal law are under such anxious consideration it may conduce to the edification of the public if we exhibit some particulars of the condition and treatment of crime in France. This we are enabled to do very circumstantially by the aid of a report recently emanating from the Ministry of Justice in that country; indeed, the statistics of our neighbours are so marvellously elaborated, and the accounts of their various tribunals are keDt and digested with such extreme care, that the results become occasionally bewildering by their very minuteness, and it will be necessary to throw them into simpler and more general forms to render them popularly intelligible. On the other side of the Channel there are three broad graduations of oflences,-the first and most serious class being brought before the Courts of Asize; the second before the " Correctional" Tribunals; and the third before the Tribunals of Simple :Police. It will at once show the relationship in which these classesstaud toeach other if we state that the number of persons implicated under the three categories respectively were 6,480, 234,363, and 510,873. Our neighbours return in these matters the numbers not only of the offenders, but of the cases; so that a robbery, for instance, in which half-adozen burglars had been concerned would figure in one column as a single example only. We shall not, however, refer to the latter figures, but confine ourselves to the personal statistics exclusively. The returns, it must be understood, are for the year 1855 throughout. The first thing that strikes us after the graduation of offences is the classification of punishments. The sentences pronounced by the Courts of Assize upon those (4,857) of the 6,480 prisoners who were found guilty comprise penalties divided into two distinct kinds, one importing afflictive or deg,,rading punishments, the other correctional punishments. Under the former head are reckoned death, transportation, hard labour either for life or for shorter periods (travaux forc.s), and imprisonment when accompanied with labour or inflicted in a fortress. Of the whole number convicted more than half (2,500) incurred penalties of this description, but it is a remarkable illustration of the difference between the French system and our own that whereas 61 were sentenced to death (though only 28 were actually executed) no more than 20 received sentence of transportation. Of the rest, 1,358 were condemned to hard labour (228forlife), and 1,061to imnprisonment, of whom 21 were sent to fortresses. As a general deduction, it is observed that the amount of crime under this head had considerably declined in comparison with the returns of former years, but forgeries and fraudulent bankruptcies were more numerous than in 1854. Altogether offences against property more than doubled those against persons. Under the succeeding category of correctional offences the statistics are very curious. Here the numbers, as mnight be expected, increase in proportion as the gravity of the delinquencies declines. It will probably surprise our readers to learn that no fewer than 28,650 persons were apprehended in France during the year 1855 upon charges of poaching and shooting without a license; and to these cases were added 4,443 for violations of the fishery laws, and 60,473 for violation of the forest laws, though in the latter instance the proceedings probably concerned the preservation of wood rather than of game. On the other hand, the offences (we are here computing charges, not convictions) against the laws and regulations on Customs, indirect taxes, and octrois, were only 3,086 in number, while those arising from the adulteration of goods and the employment of false weights and measures were as many as 10,(198. Distinctions again appear drawn not only from the nature of the crimes themselves, but from the persons against whom they are committed. Thus, outrages and violence to public functionaries are separated from ordinary cases of that kind, and " offences against religion and outrages of ministers " of religion" constitute a class of themselves. The numbers in the former case are 7,150; in the latter, 274. The general lightness, however, of the offences proved under this head is shown by the sentences recorded. As many as 122,438 were dismissed with fine only, and 76,765 were imprisoned for terms short of a twelvemonth. The highest penalty inflicted by the Correctional Courts seems to be incarceration for a year or upwards, and it is remarked that the number sentenced to this punishment (11,661), though not a very large proportion out of 234,363, is somewhat in excess of former years. In only two specific offences, however, is the number of offenders returned as greater than in 1854, and these are the adulteration of goods and the employment of postage stamps previously used and defaced. Of the third class of delinquencies brought within the cognizance of simple police-courts very little need be said. The persons implicated were, of course, very many-no fewer than 510,873, but in 449,484 of the cases the ends of justice were thought to be attained by the infliction of a fine. In proceeding to the generalities of these statistics we shall discover some remarkable results, especially in comxiparing the sentences of imprisonment with those of transportation. The whole number of the former in the year 1855 was not much short of 100,000 (93,152), including those of hard labour. Twenty criminals only, as we have said, were left for transportation, and the returns of the previous year were more singular still, for in that period one offender only was ordered to be transported, though 79 received sentence of death. MIoreover, although upwards of half of thoRe sentenced to death in 1855 received a coiu,nutation of punishment, it was in every case to lard labour or imprisonment for life, and not to tralimp4irtation ; so that under the French code incarc;raiti, n with labour represents the next penalty to thtQ guillotine. It is observed that capital puiiishlmie.ts, though fewer in 1855 thanin 1854, whciw they were 42 in number, show an increase over r! ,iara 1851 and 1853, when they were only I .- I respectively. In 1852 they were 26. th rtl-' 2> who suffered in 1855 as many as 19 blad committed mwrder simply as a prelude to robbery. VWith respect to the degree of education discernible in the higher class of offenderF, it is said that of the 6,480 per5ons chaged ulnder the inrt category 306 had received zi,perior instruction, 880 could read and write well, 2,486 had been imperfectly taught in these respects, and 2,808 were completely illiterate. In the second class of offences it is remarked that the criminality of women hadincreased, and had shown a aimilar tendency in preceding years,-an explanation of which fact is tendered in a remark that women are now more frequently prosecuted for commercial frauds than formerly, and are, moreover, impelled to mendicity (one of the delinquencies pertaining to this category) as well as robbery by the excessive prices of food. In the case of Tery young prisoners extenuation is admitted, for in the first class of offenders 45, and in the second 4,068, " being children of less than "16, were acquitted as having acted without "discernment," though in the former instance all, and in the latter more than half, were sent to penitentiaries or houses of correction. How far this policy was followed by permanent amendment we do not learn, but of the whole number of persons (240,843) tried before the two higher Courts we are told that 38,771 had been previously convicted, and-what is more-that the numberof such cases was increasing. Upon the whole, however, the aspect of these affairs in France is considered both satisfactory and promising, and our readers will probably be able to make an interesting application of such clear statistics to the questions before us at home.
Whatever may be the general prosperity of the nation, it is pretty clear that a certain amount of pauperism must be conzidered permanent in the metropolis and the great towns. Even in the Atlantic cities of America there are the aged who cannot Work, and the journeymen of depressed trades who cannot get work, to be provided for. This great capital and its suburbs, with nearly 3,000,000 of people, must therefore expect to have its perpetual multitude of unfortunates, who must be maintained by those who are able to make a living. The question of Poor-rates is, therefore, one of the most important which can affect the householder. That the inevitable burden should sit equally on all, the constant drain exhaust no one more than another, is a matter worthy of the most careful legislation. But how stands the case in London? Is not every one aware that in certain parishes the Poor-rate is but a trifle-that, in fact, there arie no poor to be supported-while in others the householders are burdened with a most oppres sive impost ? It is weU known that sometimes one street lets better than another adjoining it, simply because the former is in a parish of respectable residences and well-to-do shops, while the other belong& to a district which contains some nest of poverty, squalor, and crime. But, not only are parishes of what may be assumed as equal wealth unequally taxed, but the working of the system is to give to those that have, and to take away from those that have not. It is evident that the parishes which are the most free from paltry tenements will be those inhabited by the richer classes, while the poor wil live among those who are almost as poor as themselves. The wealthy will therefore be freed from a burden of which the industrious and struggling cannot get rid. The rate in the pound for different parishes in London varied in the year 1866 from 7id. to 3s. 4d. And which were the parishes that presented this strong contrast? The rich, aistocratic, and Royal parish of St. George, Hanover-square, paid the 7id. ; while St. George'sin-the-East paid the 3s. 4d. Of the lightlytaxed parishes we may mention St. Jamesgs, Westminster, rated at 101d.; Paddington, at 7id.; Islington, atls. Oid.,-aU fashionable or respectable localities; while, on the other hand, we have Shore. ditch rated at 3s. 4jd.; Whitechapel, at 2s. 7id.; Bethnal-green, at 3s. 2d.; St. George's, Southwark, at 2s. ld.; Btotherhithe, at 3s. Oid.; and so on. It is evident, therefore, that those districts in which the poor have their dwellings are condemned to pay a much higher rate than the more fortunate neighbourhoods which have been swept of inferior tenements. The consequences of such a system are obvious. The poor are employed all over themetropolis, and yet there are only certain districts in which they can live, it being the direct interest of the parish, the landowner, and the builder to destroy the kind of houses inhabited by the labouring classes. Thus, not only are the solvent inhabitanta of the poor parishes taxed exorbitantly, but a burden is imposed on the poor themselves--the burden of living in places far from their work, and wasting time and strength in passing to and fro. An " Association for Promoting the Equalization "of the Poor-rates and Uniformity of Assessment" observes in its address, that the present laws are "unjust and cruelly oppressive, their effect being "that in those parishes where property is of "the greatest rateable value the charge for "Poor-rate is so light as to be only nominal, while, on the contrary, in those parishes where "the houses are small, and where the labouring "man can find a residence, the Poor-rate is most "oppressive, varying from 3s. to 4s., 5s., and " even lOs. in the pound per annum. In the for- mer case it 'wil be found to be only 4d., 3d., "2d., and, in a few cases, only one farthing in "the pound for the year." Al these facts point to something like a general rate for the entire metropolis; and there is, indeed, much to be said in favour of such a scheme. London is a city of an extent out of all proportion to the other towns of England, and it is the only large city in this part of the kingdom. It might, then, be not unfairly considered as an exceptional region, and, as it has its Central Criminal Court, it might be furnished with its General Poor Law Board and rate. But there are, on the other hand, many difficulties. The metropolis has been well described as not so much a city as an aggregation of neighbourhoods. The gentry and tradespeople of St. George's and St. James's, of Belgravia and Tyburnia, have as little as possible to do with the manufacturing population of Lambeth and Southwark, the maritime race of Wapping and Blackwall, or the vast labouring population of Bethnal-green and its neighbourhood. In fact, London is a metropolis properly so called, with its Court and Legislature and administration of justice; but it is also a great seaport, and a great manufacturing city. To throw aU these together, and tax eachindividual according to the wants of the whole, would be pretty much as if Liverpool, Manchester, and one or two favourite watering-places were united to support the poor of the whole. It would be conceding the principle of central as opposed to local ratinig; and, were it established for London, it might soon be demanded for the entire kingdom. But, leaving this great question aside for the present, we think much may be done by the parishes themselves. There is no doubt that at present there exist great inequalities, from the system of fictitious rating which prevails. Instead of rating all houses equally, some are made to pay on their rack-rent, some on two-thirds, and some on not more than half. It is evident that this is an inherent defect which will render ineffectual any scheme for an equalization of burdens. Even were London united for rating purposes, the inequalities would exist as heretofore so long as somne parishes or parts of parishes were only half-rated, while others paid up to the full rentaL It is cer- tainy a great hardship for St. George'ain-the.Eut thatitsProperty-taxvalue should be 106P4691. while its Poor-rate aseument amounts to 153,297 1.; also for Bethnal-green and Whitechapel, that a similar excess should appear; while St. GEeorge'g, H anover-squaro, with a Property-tax value of 1,097,5801., should only be asesed at 694,3801. We find that this rich pariah is not only lightly rated from the absenco of poor, but that the nominal rating is in reality much less, from a low fictitious value being mubstituted for the real value of the property. Under the present system this nominal rating is no test of the real burden on the parish. Until, thereforo, uniformity of assessment be attained, either by the voluntary action of tho parishes or by the interferenoo of the Legislature, there can be little hope of a practical equalization of Poor-rates; and the great Metropolitan Union, with its general rate of Is. in the pound, must remain a vision of the future.

FOREIGN INTELLIGENC,. - FRANCE. (PBOM 0oUI OWN CooliL.'WtjhL)kKT.1 [A. poron of the foUoing appeared in o.r gecond edi. Almn ct 4,J- -I.t PARIS, APRIL 17, 6 P.M. I do not yet despair of seeing the difference be%bween the Mexican and Spanish Governments pac;fically settled, though it will require great tact and much forbearance to do so. Marsulal Serrano had an interview with Count Walewski on Wednesday, and with Lord Cowley yesterday, on the subject. HIe was also to have seen, and I believe has seen, M. Lafragua, the Mexican Envoy, this afternoon. Whether it be the supposition that Englantd has no great ,desire to have another quarrel with the United ,States, in case an attempt by the Filibusters on Cuba should require her interference, and that France should shape her conduct after that of 7,ngland, or whether it is from real unwillingness to go to war with its ancient dependency, it is certain that the Spanish Government are still reasonable and moderate in their demands, more moderate merhaps than in strict justice they might be. As I have said before, they desire M. Lafragua's arrival in Madrid with as little delay as possible; they are anxious to bear al he has to say, to treat him with (every consideration, and if any fair explanation or satisfaction can be offered for what has occurred, I have no doubt he will be received as the official representative of the Mexican Government. The interviews of Marshal Serrano with him are, of course, -s yet, non-official; but I trust that a frank and free explanation which will have taken place this afternoon willremovemost of the difficulties. TheMexican 3E:nvoy is a man of education and intelligence, and I report says of a conciliatory character. To such a ran some latitude ought, of course, to have been left by his Government, and it is to be hoped he wl use it in a proper manner. If, however, all these efibrts are in vain, and M. Lafragua, who hias already stated his desire to give explanations, remains unchanged, then I should not be surprised if the Spanish Government addressed a note to the English and French Cabinets, and probably to the other great Powers of Europe, setting forth the wrongs Spain has suffered, the moderation of the demands she has made, and declaring, that in the event of hostilities being forced upon her, she is not to be held responsible for the consequences. This step would probably be in accordance with the couneels of the two Governments to which she has already looked for advice. The Neuchatel question is not yet over. A pro'tocol, or whatever name such an authority as M. Benedetti or M. Feuillet de Conches would give it, Is, I hear, drawn up, or very nearly so. The exact terms of it I am ignorant of, but the sense is said to be this:-The Representatives of the four Powers declare that they have done their best to -effect an arrangement between the Helvetic Confederation and Prussia, an arrangement which, in their judgment, was the best that could be made in the interest of the contending parties. They offer it for their acceptance, but they have neither the intention nor the power to force them to accept It, though they strongly recomumend them to do ao. If, however, the refusal to accept these propositions should be followed by any ulterior sneasures bearing a hostile character, the four Powers will do their best to prevent hostilities breaking. out between the two nations. I alluded yesterday to the unwillingness of the Grand DukeConstantineto bereceived with the extraordinary pomp originally proposed, that his Imperial Wighnesa's wishes would to a great extent be gratifled, and that, in all probability, neither the Minister -of War nor the Minister of Mainne would go to meet him. The ceremonial for tbe reception of the Grand Duke has been arranged by the Master of the Cere-monies, and of couree submitted to the Emperor, who has approved it. The Emperor would naturally desire to receive the Prince with extraordinary splendour. The Patrte publishes the following letter:- " Monsieur le R6dacteur en Chef,-The Times, on tho faith of its Paris correspondent, and, after The Times, other English journals, announce the obstinate refusal of his Imperial Highnees Prince Napoleon to proceed to Toulon -to receive there the Grand Duke Constantine. This is a pure invention. It hls no more foundation than the pretended journey of Admiral Hasnelin with the same object. "Please, Sir, to insert this contradiction in tbe next nutmber of the P7i7e, and accept the assurance of my very distinguished consideration. "The Secretary of the Emperor, " Chief of the Cabinet, *-MhOCQUAItD. "Palace of the Tuileries, April 17'." M. Mocluard is, as he decribes himself, the Private Secretary of the Eimperor-l'homme aux petits serretq. The qualification of the statement about the Prince declining to go to Tolilon as a " pure invention" is quite characteristic of the Cabimnt. The Chef has only written what was dictated to him, and I consequently attach little credit to the deniial of a person wlho is no authority. If the snperiors of the said Chef du Cabinet addressed a similar denial to the papers, one might know what importance to give it. As it is, I am stiU disposed to attach at least as much credit to the original statenment as to M. Mocquard's denial. The lPays publishes a private letter from the Crimea, of the 3d inst., which announces that in pursuance of a plan recently adopted at St. Petersburg great works were being commenced at the port of Kaffa, which wiUl render it the most important commercial and maritime establishment in the Black Sea. The NYnd of Brussels, the organ of the Russian Government, contradicts the statament published in some papers relative to the Grand Duke Constantine's intention to visit England. The Grand fluke, it is added, will proceed from Paris to Bor*deaux, and the French ports on the Atlantic and the Channel. His Highness will thence pass tthrouigh 3e]gitum, Holland, Hanover, and Prussia to St. Petersburg. The Grand Duke has likewise abandoned his intention to proceed to Rome. The announceii visit of the Dowager-Empres of Russia to Franeo is likewise contradicted. The rec-ipts of the Paris and Orleans Railway Companiy for the week endinig the 8th of April amount to 1,174,524f. 94c., being an increase as compared with the corresponding week of last year of 232,2:;i;f. 75c. The receipts from the 1st January lst to the Sth inst. amouniit to 15.319,837f. 97c., being an inerease as compared with the corresponding period of toe year 1856 of 2,8Glt225f. 41c. The following private telegraphic despatch has been received :_ " TRIESTE, ArnIL 16. "Intelligeneo has been received from Constantinople to the 10th. It was proposed to organize a sort of Zollverein between tbo provinces of the Danube as a means of conciliation in the question of the Principalities. " The Circassians had repulsed the Ruosnins at the end of March in the mountains of Tuabh, the Russians losing 700 men atd the Cireassians 300. "From Athens, under date of the 11th inst., news has been reoived that the Committee on the Budget has formally declared that the Ministry has wasted the public money." M. Rouet, French Consul at Constantinople, M. Vernosac, French Consul at Adrianople, and the RUsBian Generals Woleskoi and Necopoichezki, have arrived at Marseilles. The works of the railway from Marse-illes to Toulon are continued with great activity along the entire line. Two tunnels are being piermed between Aubagne la Ciotat and Cassis. -e.ese ar- tne most serious and the most difficult portions of the works. The first of these tunnels (that of Feneqtrel) will be 2,600 yards long ; the second (that of the Jeanots) will be 1,620 yards long. It is expected that these tunnels will be completely pierced in less than a year, anid that the entire road l mnay he opened to the public by the end of the J year 1858. The experimental squadron under Vice-Admiral Trdhoitart has returned to Tonlon fromn the lies d'Hycres. Among the vessels composing it are the following fine screw line-of-battle ships :-The Bretagne, Tourville, Ulm, Arcole, Agesilas, and Austerlitz. Admiral Tr6houart has hoisted his flag -on board the Bretagne. Admirals Lavaud and Pellion will hoist their flags on board the Tourville and the Ulm. The Grand Duke Constantine will be received at Toulon in his capacity of Grand Admiral, and it will therefore be the naval authorities alone Who will do the honours.

A letter from Mlilan of the 13th inst. informa us that if any change has taken place in public opinion in that city, it is in favour of a more liberal policy. It is added that, to the surprise of the entire population, not one~ of the measures of reform announced in the journals has yet been carried into execution. The only ehange that has taken place is that a few individuals have been decorated, and that a few prisoners hive been released. Among the prisoners set at liberty are some who vere convicted of o'2inary crimes, and even of robbery. When set n they commenced their old trade, and robberies have become more numerous in the city than formerly. All the decrees pablished by the Emperor during his residence at Milan have remained a dead letter. The laghetto near the hospital continues to infect the air of the neighbourhood. As to the churcbyard. no preparations have yet been made to remove it. The works at the public gardens are progressing so slowly that it might be asserted they are intended for posterity, and not for the present generation. There is no want, however, of plan. There is a plan for a square opposite the theatre della Scala, for a Custom-house, for public daughter-houses, for a central railway-station; but their execution is postponed to the Greek Kalends. It cannot be otherwise, as the corporation is overloaded with debt, and the Government taxes are excessive. Previous to the Emperor's arrival the Civil Governor assured the merchants that a discount-bank should be established at Milan, under the patronage of the Emperor. But, notwithstanding the necessity for such an institution and the promises made for its establishment, nothing has been done. The Archduke Maximiliau was expected at Milan on Sunday last. He proposed to leave in a few days for Paris, and thence for Brussels. Consequently there had been no preparations made at Milan for the Archduke's reception. l'he official festivities had been adjourned to the month of August next, for it is at that period the Archduke's marriage with the Princess Charlotte, daughter of the King of the Belgians, is to take place. The Archduke Maximiiian is to receive annuaUy 280,000 florins as Governor of the Lombardo-Venetian provinces, and 420,000 forins for extraordinary expenses. The responsible editor of the Ammisaore Ailensandrino, a Piedmontese paper, was condemned by default a few days ago by the Court of Appeal of Casale to four years' imprisonment and a fine of 6,000f. for having published an article under the title of " The IDsurrection," in which it advocated the overthrow of the constitutional monarchy. The Moniteur de la Plotte publishes a letter from Shanghai of the Tth of February, which describes a ceremony that took place there in commemoration of the deliverance of Shanghai by the officers and seamen of the Jeanne d'Arc and the Colbert. A solemn mass was celebrated on the preceding day in the French quarter called Yang-King-Pang to the memory of those who fell under the walls of Shanghai on the Gth of January, 1855. Monseigneur Danicourt, Bishop of Antifelles, officiated in presence of M. Edan, the French Consul; M. Merle, the British Vice-Consul; Captain Nicholson, of the British frigate La Pique; several officers of his staff. the Spanish Vice-Consul, a delegate from the Portuguese Consulate, all the French residents, and a number of the British residents. The mass was followed by a sermon from M. Languillat, a Jesuit. After the sermon the clergy proceeded to the residence of the French Consul, where prayers were said over the mausoleum by M. Danicourt. The ceremony was concluded by the following speech from the French Consul:- " The two years which separate us from this heroic but costly deliverance of Shanghai, far froni loosing their effect on the hearts of the populatioa, have, on the contrary, made it stronger. Let us therefore honourthis glorious mausoleum as an immortal emblem for the navy, for religion, for our duty, for all Frenchmen, for the honour and dignity of the national character, and for that powerful colony of Shanghai, for the honour of the West. Let us give a new and solemn adieu to the noble dead of the Jeaune d'Arc and the Colbert."

The following information, which has been obtained from an intelligent Italian who not long since was at Naples, will hardly fail to interest your readers:-All is for the present quiet at Naples, but the aversion to the existing state of things is as great as ever. An impression prevails in foreign countries that the Neapolitan Liberals have a great sympathy for England and France, but this is not the case, as the more intelligent among them have succeeded in convincing their fellows that no good can possibly result from such futile measures as those that have been taken by the Western Powers. The only service the Neapolitan nation has to ask at the hands of the Great Powers is, that they wiU induce the King to abdicate in favour of his son, the Duke of Calabria, who would certainly introduce a more rational system of government, "and might perhaps be persuaded to grant such a Constitution as would satisfy the people without endangering the stability of the throne." The Neapolitans, like the rest of the Italians, have no sympathy for foreigners, and consequently the Muratists have no chance of success. "Infact, the party exists but in name." From time to time the King liberates political offenders, but he reso- lutely refuses to permit any list of them to be published, " as he is resolved not to do anythin g which could induce the world to fancy he had made a concession to the Western Powers." General von Martini not long since ventured to hint to the King that it would produce a favourable impression if the names of the persons set at liberty were made public, but His Majesty reeived the counsel of the Austrian diplomatist most ungraciously The position of General von Martini is an unpleasant oiie, for no attention whatever is paid to the suggestions which he, by order of his Government, every now and then makes to the Neapolitan Cabinet. "The truth of the matter is, that England and France are only hated by the Neapolitan Court, whereas Austria is both hated and despised." A remarkable difference between the political feelings of the Neapolitans and of the other Italians was pointed out. The Neapolitans, who desire to remain a completely separate and independent nation, wish that their own Government should make those changes in the administration which are necessary to their well-being a-nd happiness, but the Roman, Tuscan, and Austro-Italian Liberals look to a foreigu Power (Sardinia) for the redress of their grievances. There are one or two passages in the foregoing which are not likely to give satisfac- tion to English readers, but it appeared to be my duty to lay before you a complete summary of what was said by my informant. The Bishop of Linz, who is one of the most violent of the Austr,a; Ultramontanists, has reo ceived from Hi, Holi.!.ss a letter, from whici the following are a few cst'acts:- " It Lwas most agrtal)J,s to me to learn by thy ks*r that the, C-aueral Asse%a~Ik, --j Linz of the Catholic. Vllaone ot, Austria and Germany was so weU attendedL It a also right pleasing to us to hear that the assembly erpesed its high veneration for our person and for the chafr of St. Peter. Great was our joy aiso to receive IntelplJnco that in thy diocess so many priests subjected tbemelver to spiritual exercises, and that the residents in manv of the convents did the same. Particularly agreerble wlV the information that holy missions had been ,ent to so many places in thy dioceFs, and that they hcd rIlred7 been attended with such excellent results.

The right rev. prelate has received permission to go to Rome, from which city he will probably return with stockings and gloves a shade darker than those which he now wears.* He evidently aspires to a cardinal'x hat, but he is not likely toget it, as he is but the suffagan of the Archbishop of Vienna. Some people fancy that the clergy are lesa ambitious than laymen, but they would soon be of a different opinion if they were to reside in Austria or in Rome for a time. The Russians in Naples and Sardinia give great offence to the Roman hierarchy because they openly express their opinion that the Italian peninsula will never be at peace so long as the Pope is a temporal as well as a spiritual ruler. The Wiener Zeitung, of this morning, contains the text of a treaty which was concluded on Dec. 5, 1856, between Austria and Rome, for the mutual "extradition of all those persons who have been guilty of offences which, according to the present or any future Austrian penal code, are or shall be designated crimes." That all kinds of political offenceo are considered crimes in Austria need hardly be said. According to the Cracow Czas the Jesuits are remarkably active in Posen. The so-called " MissionHaus" in the capital of the Grand Duchy sends preachers to the dioceses of Posen, Gnesen, Breslau, Culm, and Ermeland (Konigsberg). Yesterday there vwas a vague rumour in circulation that Count Valentine Esterhazy had been insulted at St. Petersburg, but no confirmation of the report has been obtained. As was yesterday said, the Austrian Minister in Russia is likely to receive a prolonged leave of absence. Credible information has been given me that the Archduke Charles Louis is to be transferred from the Tyrol to Gallicia, where he will be either Stadtholder or GovernorGeneral. According to a letter to-day received from Trieste, the Novara will start on her voyage round the world on the 19th or 20th inst. The Novara, a frigate of 1,700 tons burden, was built at Trieste. fer speed is about 12 knots an hour. The crew consists of 16 officers, 14 midshipmen, 200 sailors, 100 marines, and 4 medical men. The scientific commission consists of Dr. Hochatetter, for physiology and geology; Drs Frauenfeld and Celebor for arts and sciences in general; Dr. Scherzer for ethnography (statistical accounts of nations and races); M. Zeleny for landscape painting; and M. Gellinek for horticdlture. The route to be taken is from Trieste to the island of idssa, Gibraltar, Rio Janeiro, Buenos Ayres, Cape of Good Hope, the islands of St. Paul and Amsterdam, Ceylon, Calcutta, the NKicobar Islands (the expedition will arrive here in December, and remain three months), Sumatra, Borneo, Celebes, Manilla, Amoy and Hongkong, Formosa, New Guinea, Australia (Melbourne and Sydney), New Zealand, New California, the Society, Marquesa, and Sandwich Islands, North America (not to San Francisco), Canada, Central America, Valparaiso, and by Cape Horn to the Falkland Islands. The Triester Zeitiung seriously states that M. Cavezzali, an apothecary at Lodi, has discovered a means of making silk out of mulberry leaves. The Vienna Trieste Railroad, which will be completed by the end of July, is about 355 English miles in length. The change in the Austrian currency wil be attended with a loss of about 2i per cent., but it will probably be made good by the State. PRUSSIA. (FROM OURt OWN0 0 O. RX O s-DN.) B.RL A, PRiu 16. Baron Von Manteuffel returned to Berlin from his seat in the Lausitz on Tuesday evening; and it is therefore probable that a further communication may soon be made to Count Hatzfeldt in reply to his last despatches in the Neuchatel matter, which arrived last week. If it be correct, as the telegraph has told us, that the representatives of England, France, Russia, and Austria had a conference toge. ther on Tuesday last in Paris on the subject of the Neuchatel question, it must be that they were occupied with the finding of some temrmoyen, in the hopes of arranging matters between the conflicting parties, for now that the matter has gone so far it will never do to let it drop again without arriving at some settlement. I cannot find any grounds here for the statement, put forward in certain journals, that the Prussian demand for an indemnity has been reduced from 2,000,000f. to 800,000f., or, in fact, that any arrangement at all has been come to with Switzerland on that point; but I am very willing to believe that when all other points are settled satisfactorily, more particularly those recognizing his sovereignty as de jure up to the last moment, the King will not make any difdiculties at accepting any reasonable proposal the four Powers in conference may make him. In some papers there is mention made of the King's being about to take a trip to Italy, and more particularly to Rome, very shortly; it is more than probable that the idea has been talked of in the Court circle, but it is a good deal less than probable that it will in any way be acted upon. Yesterday the Staats-Ministerium, or Council of Ministers, had a sitting, at which the business of the present Chambers, more particularly a project for depriving the paper money of other States which offer no sufficient guarantee for their solvency of all currency in Prussia, was considered. A preliminary step hereto was taken a year or two back by making it unlawful to offer or accept foreign bank-notes under 1O thalers' worth in buying or selling; this measure will possibly now be extended to a]l the paper money of the rest of Germany that does not stand in good credit; but it will not preclude the money-changers from doing business in that class of paper, the sole object being to protect the public unversed in these matters against any possible loss in case of the bankruptcy of banks in the neighbouring States. The project of a bridge over the Elbe from Hamburg to Hamburg with a railroad thence to Cuxhaven and Bremerhaven is stated to be perfectly arranged, and to be in a fair way of going forward for execution. The last telegraphic news from Copenhagen states that the King of Denmark had commisioned M. Bluhmie to form a Ministry, but that he had declined the honour on the plea of ill-health. Subsequently the same commission had been offered to Geheimerath Tillisch, of whose answer we have as yet no indicatioDs. The resignation of the bulk of the Ministry had not been accepted when the last advices left, but it was not belioved that they would retain their partefeuiles. The King's acceptance of HerrVon Scheele's resignation was countersigned by the Minister of Marine, Michelsen; he is, however, intrusted with the conduct of public business until a fresh Ministry is formed. ITALY. (FROM oUR own oIsPoNDZxT .) TURIN, ArRiL 14. It would appear to be the desire of the Austrian Government at present to give its denunciations of this country more of a personal than a national character, and it is quite possible that, in pursuance of this diversion, whereby it is hoped to escape from an embarrassing dilemma, it may be intimated to other Powers that if Count Cavour were to retire from the Government the Austro-Sardinian difference might at once be arranged. The Armonics of Turin, which possesses a marvellous instinctiveness of the wishes of the Vienna Cabinet, told its readers the other day, that if Count Cavour was possessed of that exquisite feeling which should be expected in a Piedmontese patrician, he would imitate the example of the Prophet Jonah in order to save the vessel o3 the State, saying-" If this tempest is raise: en my account I will willingly throw myself int' the sea." The. Anmiac does not seem to anlticipate that the 'subeelent fate of a Piedmonteso patrician under these cirwumstances would bear any resemblance to that of the Prophet it recommends for imitation, but I have no hesjtation in saying that if Coant Cavour were to resign tomorrow on such grounds he would be reinstated within three days, because it would be impossible for any of his opponents to form a Ministry with the present Chamber of Deputies, and if tho Chamber were dissolved the country would eoord its confidence in him as unmistakeably as England }ia just done in Lord Palmerston. Nothing, na fi-t, could tend more effectually to increase the popailarity of Count Cavour than an attempt to unseat him by Austrian intrigue. Count Cavour is not now a popzdar Minister, properly speaking; every one admits his great talents, and owns to his necessity in the Government, but he is more respected than liked, and more feared than loved, but only let it be known that he is the object of Austrian persecution, and his countrymen will become entbusiastic about him. The Austrian press is sad to have received instructions to abstain from all attacks on Sardinia (a pretty clear proof that the Austrian Government can suppress offensive articles if it pleases, and a tolerable evidence of what " freedom of the press" in Austria really means), but there is still a little nibbling now and then which Is probably not distasteful to those in authority. The Verona Gazette, received here yesterday, has a strange article on the renewed close alliance of Austria and England, which may or may not be complimentary to the latter, but which certainly is intended to institute an odious comparison with Sardinia. After stating that this renewed friendship was the natural consequence, of the position of the two countries after the Peace of Paris, it explains why Austria feels highly satisfied at the result of the recent general election, and then goes on to show that this is not a proof of Austria having changed her policy, but of England having altered hers. It says:- " HaS Austria, in extending her hand to Palnerston, and in expressing her satisfaction at his recent triumph over the Opposition that wished to ruin him, changed her policy, contradicted herself, or given proof of instability, of undecided policy ? No;' Austria has always pursued the same patb, and will always do so courageously. " The transfiguration has taken plce in the English (overnment, and more particularly in the conduct of thePrime Minister. It is Palmerston who has repented, and not Austria that has changed in policy and seeks alies and protectors. Austria is glad to renew that friendly intercourse which appeared to become more and more distant; but for her the new alliance is an argument of mere moral satisfaction; she saw before that even animosity could hurt her very little; for the revolutionary party, on the con. trary, the loss is irreparable. It is repudiated by all the Cabinets of the European Powers with one aingle exception; and the exception, precisely because iolated, cannot last, although a repentance like that of Palmerston's cannot be hoped for; for such a regeneration it is necessary to have the lofty genius and frank character of Palmerston." You may think it doubtful, perhaps, whether this sort of moral crucifixion is a greater punishment to the repentant Palmerston or to the unrepentant Cavour, but the Austrian official writer seems at least to have been anxious to give them each their deserts, according to his own notions of justice. As it is already announced that the Austrian Government does not mean to take any notice of the supposed intended camp at Alessandria, it is almost needless to contradict a report which first emanated from a German newspaper. As the rumour has been seriously repeated by other journals, however, it may be as well to state that there never was any intention of forming a camp at Alessandria in the spring, and it is more than probable that if there had been the Minister of Finance would have put a atop to it without the interference of Austria; but it has always been the custom to have a camp of exercise in the autumn here, and the country about Alessandria has usually been selected for the purpose, as offering every variety of ground. The last camp formed there was in the autumn of 1853, under the command of the Duke of Genoa. The Crimean war interrupted the system of late years, and if it is revived this autumn, it will be nothing more than what would have taken place if Sardinia and Austria had been on the most amicable terms. The Senate met to-day ana commenced the discnssion on the Bill for abolishing privileeyed places. after passig the first section of the first clause the debate was adjourned to to-morrow. The Minister of Grace and Justice presented a Bill (passed by the Chamber of Deputies) for authorizing the Ecclesiastical Fund to contract a loan in order to pay the clergy of the Island of Sardinia, which was agreed to without discussion. The departure of the Empress Dowager of Russia from Nice is said to be postponed to the 21st. There has been a report current here for some tine that the French Minister, the Dac de Grammont, was about to be appointed to St. Petersburg; but it appears to be at least premature, if not altogether without foundation. Letters from Florence say that the new Papal Nuncio had been making every effort lately to induce the Grand Duke to sign a Concordat like the Austrian, but as yet without effect. The Nuncio, it seems, reckoned much for assistance on the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, M. Lenzoni, who was till lately Tuscan Minister at Vienma, but in this he was disappointed, probably because IV Lenzoni had seen enough of the working of the Austrian Concordat to convince him that such a treaty would be an enormous evil for any Government to introduce. TUSCANY. A letter from Florence of the 10th inst. informs us that the party of the Jesuits is making increased efforts in Tuscany to acquire an official position, which they have not yet accomplished, public opinion without distinction of political party being strongly opposed to that religious order. Signor Cavoni, one of their most zealous partisans, who has much influence at Court, has procured for them a palace in the centre of the town, to which a church is attached, and which is well attended by many fashionable ladies, and among theon the Baroness Fluigel, wife of the Austrian Minister. The Jesuits are endeavouring to obtain the direction of some large academy, to the great terror of the fathers of the Suole Pie, who are determined adversaries of the Jesuits. The country, which is very susceptible on the subject of the Jesuits, is apprehensive of their againestablishing themselves init. The Grand Duke, however, though he is feeble, and often influenced by his courtiers, is still very jealous of his power, and dreads the aspiring character of the Jesuits. This fear, strengthened by reports from Vienna, where the Concordat is not popular, renders more powerful the party which, even in the Ministry, is opposed to any further concessions to the Court of Rome. The latter, we are told, is now much irritated at the course pursued by the Tuscan Government, which is regarded in the Eternal City as nearly as irreligious as the Sardinian Government. The great ground of complaint is that the Tuscan Government takes every opportunity of diminisbing the effect of the Concordat. The consequence is that some of the Tuscan sees are vacant, the Government refusing to present candidates. SPAIN. (IROMI U0. OWN CORRX8PONDMiT.) MADRID, APRIL13. Within the last 48 hours there have been arrested in Madrid a number of persons, chiefly priests and ex-Carlist officers, charged with Montemolinist machinations. The number certified to me is 22, but it is not certain that this comprises all who have been taken up. To-day, as usual when anything of this kind occurs, absurd rumours buzz at the street corners, and supply material for the bald gossip of the Puerta del Sol. There was to have been an outbreak in the streets of Madrid, say the alarmists, but for the vigilance and promptitude of the authorities. I do not believe there was to have been anything of the kind, and I very much doubt whether any of the persons arrested are guilty of anything worse than, perhaps, wishing well to Don Carlos. Most of them are extremely unobnoxious to suspicion, and of some of them I know enough to feel persuaded they are not conspirators. Four priests and two Carlist colonels (Santocildes and Jaureguy) are among the prisoners. Prodigious zeal seems to have been displayed by the authorities. The sbirri charged to arrest a priest, not finding him at home, captured his maid-servant and a boy of 13, son of a Spanish nobleman, who hap. pened to be visiting, the clergyman for instruction. The boy's fatbhrhurriedoff in alarm to'Senor Marfori, the Civil Governor and AlealdeCorregidor in esse, and, it is reported, the Minister de! Fomento in posse, lmctested the iunocence of hi4 child, who truly 4 isa er young ta be a conspi. rator, aud obtainedUMeame. A&Xwcrds the par, ticular charge on which they are ia,prisoned, it is probable that most, if not all, o,' the persons confined have just as good A right to be set at liberty as that child; but, as they are grown nit "a, they are kept under lock and key. According to 'he belief of those who warch a little below the sxsnace, the whole affair is got up by the police and by oa der of Don Ramon Narvae, who desires at once to X 'ake a display of energy, to deter the Qaee f& m Abwolutist dalliance, and to be able to meet tS e Cortes 'with the zy "The country is in danger r' Marshal Xarvaezfeels the necessity of doing sorn thing to revive his imputation for vigour and action..

Bias Quic tachrynue-thosej I mean, which the unlucky captives may -e aupposedcto be sheiding in gaol. lt is rather sisegular that whilstw of a sudden, upwards of a score of arrests are nmde in Madrid, of persons who were living quietly, snn suspected, and without myst9ry or concealment, we do not hear of the capture of many oS the CarEist officers and soldiers who left Madrid some time ago. A few poor wretches have been shut up at Oviedos. but nobody has been caught whose name is known to any one. The question iw also asked,. whence came the money supplied to these people, for it is certain that some of t;em, who were ln great penury were well supplied with cash when they left Madrid. Now, it is not believed that the Carlist treasury is by any means well stored;. on the contrary, it is positively affirmed that ita dbor might be left wide open without the least chance of anything being stolen. But, were its off3ers. full, Count Montemolin would be wrong to expend their contents, for he would hardly do as, 3uch with their aid as is now being daily done fb6r hisn in the very Palace he aspires to occupy. I fully confirm-, notwithstanding various misstatements in Spanish papers, the information I lately communicated as to the satisfaction given, by the Mexican Government to nearly one-half of its Spanish creditors, and I am enabled to add that this. proof of a Willingness to render justice has-made a favourable impre,sion on the Spanish Ministry. and will, no doubt, tend to facilitate an amicable settlement of the pending dispute, an object which the British Minister at Madrid has been actively employing his good offices to bring about. We daily expect to learn the decision of Senor Latragna as regards his journey to Madrid, and it is hoped that it will be favourable and that he will soon arrive here. With the recent reports of General Jose Concha's recall from Cuba has been coupled one to the effect that the measure was partly to be attributed to a strOng note sent in last week by Lord Howden with respect to the gross and frequent violation of treaties latelycommittedbythelandingof slavesinthatisland. I believe it is customary, when authentic information of such transgressions reaches our Minister here, for him to send a note to the Spanish Government caUing its attention to them. These notes have of late been unusually frequent in consequence of the many complaints made, and for the same reason it may be presumed that they have been couched in terms more than usually emphatic. But, beyond this, I believe myself justified in stating that theabovereportisunfounded. As regardatherumours of General Concha's return to Spain, whetber to take his seat in the Cortes, or by order of the Government, they are not confirmed. During Concha's former command in Cuba he was noted for his honest exertions to carry out the treaty respecting slavery, but since then he appears to have grown less scrupulous, or what many here would call wiser. His three years' term of power expires in a very few months, and it is supposed that he is maling the most of his latter days. This being Easter Monday, and the first bullfight of the year, there is no Bolsa. MADRID, Arson 14. The Government papers of last night and this morning give sundry details of what they term " a vast Carlist conspiracy, discovered by the rare activity and intelligence of Senor Marfori," and which was to break out on Easter Sunday in six or seven provinces. Besides the arrests made in Madrid, others took place simultaneously at Valladolid, Leon, Avila, Briviesca, Burgos, Logrono, and in the Basque provinces. Neither the obsequious articles of hired journals, nor the arrest of some five score of obscure individuals, will induce people here to believe that the much talked of conspiracy has been anything more than a badly concocted farce. An unknown priest, named Ruiz y Garcia. is declared to be the chief plotter, and it was in bis house that was arrested the son o; an Arragonese Marquis, a mere lad, who was set at liberty after a few hours' detention. No papers owere found in Ruiz's dwelling except a passport for Ocana, certainly not a very dangerous or seditious docunieut. There was such a total absence of proofs, or even of grounds for suspicion, in the cases of Colonels Jaureguy and Santocildes, that both those persons have been already set at liberty, as have also been several of their fellow-prisoners, entirely insignificant persons. So far as the details as yet received from the provinces enable us to judge, there, as here, the arrests have been chiefly of persons of a low class, whose ignorance and necessities would render them an easy prey to the supposed Carlist crimps. Some of these may very likely have believed they were realy obeying the orders of Moutemolin in holding themselves ready for an outbreak, while others would not care to inquire, so long as pay was forthcoming. There are plenty of bond-fide Carlists, of a different stamp from the poor wretches who have been inveigled and taken up, who would not have remained idle if a real and serious attempt was to be made, but none of these are mixed up in the affair, or have been interfered with, and they laugh at what has just occurred as a most transparent device of the police. It is worthy of remark that one of the principal of the persons arrested, and who has since been set at liberty, acted, now several years ago, as an agent of Narvaez, to procure the adhesion to the Convention of Bergara of several Carlist Generals who still refused to subscribe to it and to recognize the Government of the Queen. The Opposition pApers dare not speak their mind with respect to this supposed terrible Carlist plot, but some of them contrive to intimate pretty plainly that they do not believe a word of it. The state of public feeling in Catalonia continues to inspire uneasiness. The question is of a social rather than of a political nature. The Auditor de Guerra, a magistrate adjoined to the Captains-General of Provinces (Senor Salafranca), has come to Madrid to expose to Government the perils of the situation, and to suggest certain measures as indispensable to be taken if tranquillity is to be preserved., The manufacturing districts, now in a depressed condition, demand to be assured that the reform of the tariff, which report and the papers have lately declared to be imminent, is not contemplated. The Bircelonese desire thQ demohtion of the fortifications of that city to be completed, the materials removed, and the land they now encumber to be apportioned agreeably to the plan long since proposed and decided upon, but which has never been carried out. In short, as usual, Catalonia is one of the chief anxieties of the Government, and it is probably only the very stringent measures lately adopted by the Captain-General, Zapatero, that have kept the province quiet np to the present time. Most of the Spanish Ambassadors and Ministers at the various European Courts are expected to return to Madri. for, or soon after, the opening of the Cortes. Most of them have only just left Madrid for their respective posts. General Serrano is to arrive about the 25th inst. He will be followed by Senors Mon, Bravo, Bermudez de Castro (Manuel and Salvador) and Alexaudro de Castro. It is certain that Seirano will not rettrn to Paris. The Dake de Rivas is here spoken of as likely to succeed hin. Narvnex wonld have sent the Duke to Paris some months ago, but the Queen would not agree to it, on account of his having been a member of the 48 bhours Ministry in July, 1854, which she considers aondoned her. It is thought possible sbe may now consent. This appointment, however, like many otber things, depends on the duration of the pre sent Ministry, which is generally considered as extremely tottering and not likely to be longlived.

How MIERCHANT SIPS AiRE MAK,-NND IN hRmICcA.. -Very few persons, except those familiar with marine affairs, have any idea of the enormous villanios which am practised by these land sharks in New York, and other large seaports, to procure a crew for a ship. The ship, heingloaded, hauls into thc stream to get ready for sea, and te mate applies to the shippings master or sailors' landlord for - his complement of men. L'the ship is bound for LiverpooL the wages offered are (at the prement time) $20 a month, and $20 advanced. The land shark immediately advertises, in k nglish and German, for "young men to work as. docklabourers, at fixed wages." Young men who, perhaps, hat. never been at sea, exerly acoept the engagement o£fered, are conveyed on board the ship just as she is ready to gets under way, and are surprised to find themselves impressedinto sea-service before the mast. If the shipping marster keeps a Water-street boarding-house, as isgenerally the case, he selects his victims from his boarders, drugs them with, rum and opium, rows themoff to the ship, hoists them aboar. in a sling, and stows them away, insensible, in the forecastle.

GREAT EXHIBITION OF ART TBEASUREB. (IPOM OUR OwN CeospomDm?i.) MANCHESTER, ABrIL 17. Having passed through the several departments and noted some of their principal contents, it only remains to refer to the arrangements which have been or are being made for the conveyance of visitors to the Exhibition and for their accommodation when there, and to describe briefly the ceremonial to be observed at the opening. In order to make the undertaking remunera-I tive at the low prices of admission already I fixed it is necessary that during the period the Exhibition wiU remain open no fewer than between 2 000,000 and 2,500,000 visits should be paid to it. iany, of course, wil go more than once; but, after making a liberal reduction for season tickets and repeated visits, nearly if not quite 2,000,000 persons must enter the Exhibition to insure its financial success. It is evident that Manchester alone, or even the whole of Lancashire, densely populated though it be, is not able to furnish so large an attendance, and hence the necessity which the Executive Committee feel of drawing a portion of their visitors from a distance. With that view they have entered into comnmunication with most of the principal railway companies in the kingdom, and various meetings, attended by delegates from those companies, have already been held at Euston-square to make arrangements for the running of special and excursion trains from all parts of the country to the Exhibition. it fortunately happens that the Palace is so situated with respect to railway conimunication that, as we formerly stated, passengers from Loncdon on the one hand, or Carlisle on the other, can be carried straight into the building. There will be no difficulty, therefore, in organizing special trains upon all the principal lines of railway in connexion with the Exhibition, and the different companies are acute enough to see that it will be for their interest to encourage, by reduced fares and otherwise, as many persons as poxible to travel towards Manchester during the enesuing summer and autnamn. In order to provide for the accommodation of viitors when they have got them the Executive Comnuittee have opened at their rooms in Mosley-street an office for the registration of lodgings, where parties having apart3nents to let and strangers who may require them will be supplied with the necessary information and guidance freo of charge. The Committee have aLso made arrangements with Mr. John Greenwood, of Pendleton, a coach proprietor, for the construction of a large number of omnibuses to run between the Exhibition and the Manchester Exchange. No effort, in short, has been spared to render the Exhibition as easily accessible as possible, not only to the inhabitants of Manchester and its viinity, but to those of every part of the kingdom, and if the people do not flock toit in the desired numbers it will not be for Vant of the means of cheap, rapid, and easy conveyance. The same careful and ample provision has been made for the comfort of visitors afterthey have actually entered the building. Akitehen, in which dinners for 20,000 persons may be aooked in one day, has been esaebhshed in connexion with the Exhibition and placed under the superintendence of an accomphshed and experienced chef. The refreshment rooms are airy and commodious, and-what, after all is the main point-the tariff lwil be exceedingly moderate. It is intended to have two catalogues-one sold at la., the other at 5s. Both will be edited by Mr. Peter Cunningham. The shilling catalogue will give, besides the usual matter the names of the former possessors of some of the principal pictures and other objects of art, and the prices at which they were sold; but the opinion of no living person will be expressed with respect to the merits, comparative or otherwise, of the articles exhibited. It will be about the same size as "M urray's Handbooks for the Continent," and will be published immediately after the opening. The 5s. catalogue Nill be a larger, more interesting, and altogether superior work, containing a great deal of additional information of importance to connoissers and collectors. It will be published as soon after the other as possible. The Executive Comrmittee have it also in contemplation to illustrate the Exhibition by a series of photographs-made of course in every instance with the permission of the proprietors-from the moat interesting articles in the various departments. This work, which has been undertaken by Messr. Paul and Dominic Colnaghi, will consist of 100 plates of different sizes, accompanied by appropriate letterpress, and it is gratifying to add that the com3mittee have already obtained the consent of Her Majesty, the Duke of Portland, the Duke of Buccleuch, and other important contributors. The hope was for a long time entertained that the Exhibition would be opened by Her Majesty in person; but the happy event which took place on Tuesday, and which nowhere excited more lively feelings of joy than in Manchester, puts that entirely out of the question. Prince Albert, however, has kindly consented to be present on the oocasion which there is some talk of observing as a general holyday. His Royal Highness will be received at the principal entrance to the Exhibition by a guard of honour, and it is not improbable that a considerable military force, under the command of Sir Harry Smith, the General commanding in the Midland district, may add alike to the splendour and the dignity of the spectacle. The Prince will be conducted in the first instauce to the reception-room near the entrance of the building, from which, after the lapse of a few minutes, he wiU emerge in a procession formed of the members of his suite, the Executive Committee, and the principal officials of the Exhibition, and will walk, thus accompanied, up thegreat hall to the dais in the centre of the transept. There an address will be presented to his Royal Elighness by Mr. Fairbairn, the Chairman of the Committee, to which an appropriate answer will doubtless be returned. TheMayor of Manchester, In the name of the corporate authorities of the city, will next read and present an address, to which also a reply may be expected. The procession will then be re-formed, and the Prince will proceed to inspect the galleries of ancient and modem pictures, the portrait gallery, the gaUery of water-colours, the collection of engravings, and the court of Oriental productions-a promenade which wiU embrace nearly every portion of the building. His Royal Highness will then return to the transept, and formally declare the Exhibition opened, after which he wiU retire with the same ceremony as before. During these proceedings the orchestra, consisting of 500 performers, under the direction of M. EH[a, will execute a selection of appropriate music, and at intervals the grand organ now m course of erection by Messrs. Kirtland and Jardine, of Mancheater, will send its swelUing tones in streams of harmony through the building. In the evening the Prince will be present at a concert to be given in the Free Trade Hall, under the auspices of the Executive Committee, the proceeds, after payment of expenses, to be handed over to the managers of the Royal Infirmary. Thus-with so much pomp and ceremony, by the Consort of the Queen, in the presence of a numerous and distinguished assembly-will be inaugurated the Exhibition of Art Treasur of the United Kingdom. It is a great undertaldng great in its conception, great in its execution, great above all in the motives from which it springs and the objects which it is intended to aerve. That its succe-- may be as complete as its projectors desire must be the fervent wish of al. Perhaps it is not too much to say that upon the result of this experiment will depend in some measure the fate of art in England for many years to come. The fine arts, like every other department of human labour, can truly flourish only when prized and supported by the body of the people. It was so in Florence, inVenie, in Bologna, in all the great schools of Italy. lf the people generally should seize the opportunity now presented of familiarizing themselves with the noblest production stof ancient and modern time the effect upon English art must be great, immediate, and beneficial; but if, on the otherbhand, they should remain indifferern to the advantages which the Exhibiton places within their reauh, our painters must pursue their labeurs under the depressing conviction that their art, beautiful, glorious, and elevating as they think it, is unappre- ciated, if not positively ontemned, by the mass of their ountrymen. The sucess of the Exhibition is desirable upon another ground. Something is due fromn the nublic to those wrho, writh so much Labour ana risk to themselves, have been activerly engiwed in the management of the nndertaking.lt wras no easy task, no slight responaib&ti' which they incarred when they resolved £fn e oJollctou of the arttreaaures of the IJnited The actual works ha been immense. t0C 4a 200 generl meeting bhare bowl held by the Executive Committee,and the weight of their responsibility may be imagined when it in xtated that the marketable value of the property under their charge is estimated at the enormous sum of 4,O0O,0001., or double the value of the whole contents of the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park. If ever men deserved well of the country they do. They entered into the scheme for no selfish purpose; but, on the contrary, were actuated only by a desire to diffuse among the people a knowledge and love of art. It is impossible that so much generosity, energy, and enterprise can fail - and in the fact that a guarantee fund of 75,00O was collected in an incredibly short time in a mingle provincial community, and almost entirely by one mdividual-that men engaged in private busineas have devoted a whole twelvemonth to a publio purpose of the highest and most enlightened kind-that they have bought on their own responsibility a celebrated collection like the Sou]age,which the Government had refused to pun e through sheer vlwant of mnoney-and that thoy have collectd in an edifice which deserves to be called a Palethe arttreasures of a kingdom rich beyondall others in theproductions of artistic genius, every one must recognimze the best earnest of future sucess. There is yet another reason why the Exhibition ought to be encouraged. Nothing but a strong sense of public duty could have induced the contributors to part for a period of six months with posseasions so rare and delicate and of such priceless value. I the people should neglect to avail themselves of their unparalleled liberality it will not be repeated, and the preaept Exhibition will be the lat, as it is the first, of its kind. For these reasons-for the sake of art, the interests of which are at stake; for the sake of the Executive Committee who have lavished time and money on a great public object; for the sake of the contributors themselves whose munificence and public spirit demand acknowledgment-one and all must wsh succeessto the Exhiition of Art Treasures of the United Kingdom.
CONER VATIZB DEMONSTBATION im SUFFOLK. BURY ST. EDMUNDS, ALPB 16, Last evening a dixc taok place In the Town.lhall of this borough to celebrate the &turn to Parliament of Mr. H. S. Waddington and CaptainP. Bennet, the Conservative members for West Suffolk. Maor Parker presided, and ws supported right and ldft by the hon. guests of the evening, Sir P. Buxton, Mr. J. H. P. Oakee (late XP. for the borough), and about 150 of the principal yeomen and farmers of the neighbourhood. At the further end of the spacious apartment, which wan well lighted and presented an animated appearance, a larwe blue banner was suspended, bearing the words "Bennet, and no surrender of the agricultural interest." The uual loyal and compnlinmeny toast having been disposed of, The CHAnua reminded the company that they Were met to celebrate the return to Parliament of two Conserva tive members for the western division of the county. (Loud cheers.) It was a matter of no mal congratulation to all present and to the country at lArge that they had been enabled to again secure the servloes of two gentlemen whose fidelity to the Conservative caue and firm determination to uphold the institutions of the country had been frequently, amply, and abundantly proved. (Loud cheers.) The Par liamentay career of their Iwe representatiwes had beon a long and valued one, and the electors had recently shown their entire confidenoe in the conduct of both gentlemen b returning them to Parliament for, the fourth or fifth tune. The healths of Mr. Waddington andCaptain Bennet were then formally proposed, and drank with three times three, and " one cheer more for the cause." Mr. WADDiNGTON, MP., who was received with loud and long continued cheering, said, he had had the honour to serve the county of Suffolk for nearly 19 years. He gratefully rturned thanks for the honour which had been so often conferred upon him, and stted that he should ear. nestly endeavour to promote the interests not only of the country but of the county. The recent dissolution ws an unexpected one. The noble lord at the head of the Government was so eircumstanced that he found he must either resign or call upon the country for a new Parliament. He chose the latter alternative, and the returns received were not exactly such as couldfhave been desired by the Opposition. It now rested with the noble lord to bring some measures before the country, and he and his colleague would be at their posts and watch with great diligence what was going forward. After the election of a Speaker by the new Parliament other questions would be brought forward, and he thought an attempt would be made at a Reform Bill; but until the Conservative party knew exactly what that Reform Bill was they could not pronounce any judgment upon it. There bad been great alterations in the new Par. hament. The House had lost, in the first plae, the Manchester squadron, who were good orators in their way, and expressed themselves generally well according to their own ideas and opinions. They had also lost the Pelites. [A Voice.-And a good Ing too.) With regard to taxation, he could not help expressing his satisfaction that some reduction had taken place in the income-tax and he hoped that before long that tax would he entirey extinguished. (Hear, hear.) He hoped also thatmoremoney would not be voted away than the Government had in hnd, as the country would en called upon for more taxes. Captain B X;T, P., who met with an equslly enthu siastc reception, said, he had not seen such a large party in Suffolk for years, and the compliment paid him was quite overwhelming. The excitement of the recent election seemed to have quite pasged away out of dcors, but he saw a strong Conservative spirit in the present meeting, and he begged them when they returned home to do what a committee had been attempting to do during the day-vi., to promote the Conservative interest in the registration. (Hear, hear.) If this were not done, a stealthy poliy pursued by the oppoite party might accomplio whatafair fight could not " ee did not often borrow from 27w !mes or the Momninp Post, which was the advocat of the Premier; but he believed TMe Timse had stated ffat the present Government was a Conservative Ministry. He dubted this altoether. He believed the present Cabinet was, as Burke had sid. a " tesBelated Government, made up of courtiers and IRepublicain." He was going to Parliament to support Conservative measures, and he trusted the party would not be a "tesselated" one on the side of the zouse on which he sat. The CuAiRbuw, in returning thanks for the toast of his health-which was proposed by Mr. Waddington, LP., and drunk with three times three and one cheer more-expressed bis hope that the interests of agriculture would ve in the new Parliament more considertion and attention than had of late years been bestowed upon them. The farmers had their raw materials as well as the manufacturers, and now that they were competing with the world, guano, which 'Was so fetttered by duties as to be hardly within their roach, had become almost a necesary to them. Re did not wiah to see the sword drawn in order to modify the duties upon guano; he should prefer to see our ships of war sent in all irections to discover it. The farmer's flocks and herds must not be subject to any injury from the introduction. of diseased cattle, and the question, which was one of vital importance, demanded close attention on the part of their representatives. In regard to polities he wished to see a reduction of taxation and Improvement of every Idnd without the destruction of our old institutions. Let the burdens of the State be reduced as much as possible, and let those which were necessr be e9ually divided among the community, for the great money mterest did not now pay enough. The agriculturists wore at present contributinL very largely to the expenses of the country, building military depots, and incurrmg heavy burdens which should be shared by the fundholders. (Cheers.) These were the reforms wished for, and ho was perfectly satisfied that their representatives would, as far they were able, seeo them carried out. (Cheers.) Mr. PETVrWARD, in proposing the health of the mambars for the eastern divzsion of the county-Lord Henniker and Sir Fitzroy Kelly-said, one of the lessons taught by the late elections was the unpopularity of what were called " independent men." The greater part of those who had been ejected were men who had not attached themselves to either of the two great parties in the State; and he believed this unpopularity of ' indefendent men" was well founaded, for he considered a Popuax Government could be best carried on through the medium of twogreat parties. It was, therefore, with the gatest pleasure that he sa`1w Suffolk return four consitent nr. J. Hv P. PChes, the unsuccessful Conservative candi. date for BurySL xlund'.,itmae,i acknowled - the toast of his heath, that a petition would bepresented against the present return for the borough as soon as possible. Theendwa not yet, although they would have to wait some two months more. (Cheers.) Sir R. BuXrTON whose health had been previously given and res,onded to, proposed the " Conservative electors of the county -his fellow.-workers and fellow soldiers in the great Conservative arm;, He congratulated them upon the easy victorythey hadlatelyobtained, butalessonmihtbhlearnt fromn the differentvictories anddefeatswhich had been going on around them. A great loss had occurred to the Conservative party in the counties, and a small one inthe boroughs. For this there were several reasons, In the firt place thes Government alwayeses -d great in'duence, and commanded some 20 or seatsi and, in the second place, the China question, which had neen very much nmsmnderstood and misrepresented, had had the effect of turning mans old and well-tried members out of their seats. llr. Cobden anld lMr. Bright were clever men and conscientious politicians, and as such he regretted that they had been osted from their seats. The Rouse of Commons now aboutato meet was entirely different iu its constitution from the eld Rouse, and, when he looked at the performances of the latter, he was not sorry to see some chango made. The late Rouse of Commons, with the exoeption of the vigorous prosecution of the Russian war-in regard to which the Goverment had had the full and undivided support of the Conservative part-had carried out, as far as he was aware, no great measure of publio utility. The late House of Commons wrs broken up into a great many ectionsand prties, and nobody knew how the independeut members would vote; but Lord Palmerston had now, aocodlng to his own organs, a working majority of 100; there were 200 Conservaties, followers of Lord Derby, and the remainder ware TUberal-Conae.erst&vu He did not exatly knowf what the latter term memat, but tunie wId show, The pret ERon" of Oem- mon would of course, expect that Lord Palmerton Liber carry to effect mea of reform and what the rero pleasd to call" progress The Liberal had been tsking about these matters on the hustings ever "llOO the last Reform Bill, but there had alwsys beans ome excuse for delaying them. , At one time there had been a War, and at another tine it wa said that they could not command amajority in the House of Commons. Thee eeCUTes would not now avnil, and there was no reason, if the Liberals mennt what they said, that they sbould not carry their measures into effect He, for one, rejoiced to see the ouse of Commons once more dividod into two great parties, es it would now be possible to see what men were made of'. A sweeping measure of reform would probably be before long brought under the consideration of the House of Commons, and this measure would divide the people into two great parties,-the supporters of order and the supporters of democracy. He believed the question was one which would affect agriculturists more than free trade or protection, for in the case of free trade the farmers' sidll and energy had enabled them to triumph over their difficulties, while in the case of a Reform Bill no sldll or energy would avail the farmers if they allowed the power which they now legiti. mately possessed to be wrested from them. He might ap, peal to the selfish interests of the farmers, and teIi thena tht if any sweeping measure of reform were passed which draded the surage into the hands of the ignorant and uottered, the immediate result would be that addi& tions weuld be made to the burders of the agriculturalinterest, which they found quite he&vy enough to bear already, while they would not only be called upon to bear increawsd burdens but have the means of meeting them reduced. Bat he wiahed to rest the o0ppo'tion to suck a measure on far broader gronasds for he believed that instead of elevatine theoondition ofthopeople of Englanditwouldtendtodegrad7 them and introduce that worst of all tyrannies, the tyranny of a democracy. As such he called upon them to resst an! isweep imeasure of'reform. It was not probable that the present Parliament would commit suicide this session, but still Ministersmight be so pressed by a majority which they could not control as to be obliged to appeal to the oountry. He wished to rm upon their notice what would happen ia such a casein West Suffolk They had had awalk over on the present occason, but ho beolieved there would be another severe contest wheneverinother election took place, and he therefore clled upon all the Conservative electors tobeaf their part honestly and manfuly. If they did, their candidates whoever they might be would gain a most decided vio: tory. They must not be disoouraged at the present position of the Conservative party. In oliticl as in other life there were clouds and sunshine, and they must remember that the battle in which they were engaged was one of principle, and not a mere party rggle for office. The true reward of a politician was the approbation of posterity, and the time would come, if not In their days, when the people of England would recognize with gatitude the conduct of those who had had the moral courace to saorifice the popularity of the hour to the main. tenanoe of those sinciples which had made England a reat country and whic were the only sure foundation oT her future welfare. (Loud cheers.) Mr. DOBITO, in responding to the toast, said, he wa once a stnch Conaervtive, and hewas still ready to oonserve anything that it was necessay to conserve. But Sir Robert Peelnha overtrown the Conservative party, and at the preet time he really did not know what were the partica- rpoints before the public It appeared to him that Lord Palmerston was as good a Conservtive as any on the other side of the House. ("Hear, hear," and expreasions of dis. Afterome obenations from r.

BIDDzu, replied to the remarks of Mr. Dobito, and stated that what he understood by a Conservative was a gentleman anxious to promote the welfare of the landed Interest-landowners and land cultivators-and to sunport the Church. Mr. Dobito had spoken as if he did not know Lord Pamerston's pinciples, and they must dl say ditto to that (gLughter) He (Mr. Biddell) never coald make out Lord Palmoraton's principles, for ho had been in all sorts of Administrations. He trusted before another election took place ome explanations owould be given on the aubect, and he had such faith in his friend ir. Dobito tha he believed he would then cease to be a supporter of the noble lord, who had a most deepotic way of making peace and war just as he pleased, and whose Administration was most chary in affording information with regard to its acts (Cheera.) Ir. DOBITO offered to explain, but The CH&nauu overruled him. Mr. WADDINGTORk LP., p roposed "Suocess to Agriculture and Commerce," and assured the company that whenever anything calculated to promote the welfare of culture was brought forward iu the House he should ylae it his warmest suppory After one or two other tosts of a complimentary and local character the meeting sepazated.
THE LUNDHIZl COLLIERY EXPLOrO1. I O IEXTING OF ENIRVR.R Tl'he operations of emptying the pit ar proceeding in a most satisfactory manner. On visiting the works at Lundhill on Friday there was every evidence that the tedious work of emptying the pit, and which has now oocupied nearly a month was nearly terminated. At 12 o'clock there was between 2ft. and 3ft. of water in the shaft, and the single bulcket in use came up little more than half ful. The water itself also ;plsinly showed that it had been in contact with the coal, being black and dirty. The escape of large quantities of explosive gas still continues, and the greatest precaution is used to avoid accidents. The fans which for a few days brought out such large quantities of gas now bring out a very much less quantity from which it is inferred tht the foul air has been near;v exhausted. Thus everything tended to the belef that the air would be snfficiently good to allow of the working parties commencing their search for the bodieg on Sunday or Monday at the latest. Indeed, there is reason to believe that the boardin, or fencing placed over the arch alone prevents the bodies from being brought up The boarding it was found necessary to put up to prevent the 'heavy iron buckets from coming in contact with any of the bodies which might rise to the surface of the water in the shat, and which would doubtless have broken or mutilated them very much. A good number of first class colliers have responded to the caU for volunteers to sist in bring- Ing out the bodies, so that onoe a commenoement has been a madefor thatpurpose thereis every prospect of it occupying only a short time. Most of those already engaged have taken precautions of so singular a charwter for their owvn preservation from the effects of the effluviuna thatit may not be out of place to mention them. Several of them havo had bags made, into which theyplacea qonantity of lump camphor; this they place in their breast ongomg down. Thecamphor, they say, will rapidly evaporate from the heat of the body, atna rijng upvraxds wiU be inhald in such q- titiee as to neutralize in a great measure the effluvium which may arise from so great a number of decomposed bodies. The proceedings havi now reached that sta'o in which the recovery of some of the bodies may take place almost any hour, the excitement of the relatives of the deceased and the curiosity of the publc have increased so much that no persons are allowed to go near the works, Many of the unfortunate wives of the men in the pit were to be seen about the works yesterday, and their dejected appearance evinced how deeply they are interested in the terminatioxn of a work which on y ends with the recovery of the bodies of those whom they had lookea up to for their alL About 1 o'dock on Friday some of the men descended the shaft for the first time since Tuesday as far as the Aldy bed, and fixed a stopping for the purpose of conveying the air to the bottomn of the shaft, and us mak-e it ready and safe to go into the workinga About half-past 10 o'clock yesterday a meeting of the engineers was held at the offlces the following gentlemen being present:-Memss Nichoczs Wood, Elliott, Woodhouse, and Rlolt. After hearing the report and the opinions of Messrs. Webster, Coe, Maddison, Potter, and Pease, the gentlemen who carry out the instructions of the committee, a long consultation took place, and at the close, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, Mr. Wood informed the reporters who were present that he was unable to give them anT information,as they were carrying out some neceraryexpen1menta, and.ba adjourned until to-morrow (Saturday) afternoon, when the result of their deliberations might possibly be made known to the public.
HOSPITAl AUBSB& TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Your correspondent, " Who has walked the Hospitals a good many Years," in his letter on hospital nurses, on Wefinesday last, observes, with great reason, that it is moet desrable that some provision should be made for good nurmes when they are past service, and that they sho2ldnot be neglcated by the institutions which have employed them. I am happy to inform you that St. John's Training Institution for Nurses, in Westminster, endeavours to make that provnson whinch your oorrespondent so justly reoom. mends.

MuXDERous AssAuLT.-A ruffian named Carter, wrho was sentenced to transportation some few years ago, but came back a short time since on a ticket-of-leave, committed a murderous assault on an elderly gentleman, named Mr. Fennell, on Saturday laat, at Rossmore, in the Qnoen's County. It appear that on the previous night the hearless wretch soldited a night's lodging from Mr. Fennell, which was hdndly granted to him; e was given his breakfast in the morning, after which (having seen Mr. Fennell go out about his farm) he seized a spde, and, having closed over the kitchen door, threatened to knock the brins out of the servant boy and girl if they did not tell him where Mr. Fennell's raoney was. The girl screamed violently, but this only made the rascal redouble his threat. The servant boy took down a gun and presented it at him, and this soon made the scoundrel decamp, but unfortunately he met r. Fennell, and renewed his demand for money; it not being granted, he gave the unfortunate me a blow on the side of the head with the spade, and then made off. Bambrick, the servant boy, pursed him, and after a chase of two miles suceceeded in suring him, and gave hime in cheh to slome of the Graue police. blr. Fennells lUfe is ' despaired of.

The Leinster BEpress is authorized to state that the petition on the part of Mr. Fitzpatrick on the ground of violence, intimidation, and obstruction of voters, with the clearest identity of agency, is in course of preparation, and will be presented in proper time. It appears that at the declaration of the new members for the Queen's County Sir Charles Coote asserted that "Mr. Fitzpatrick's agent went to Lord Lansdowne's and Mr. Fitzpatricles tenants and told them if they gave their second votes to Sir Charles Coote they would be ejected from their farms." In reply to this rather startling accusation Mr. Price, the agent in question, solemnly assures the pubBc that persecution for the free and undoubted exercise of the elective franchise has never been practised, and never would be sanctioned by the proprietors of those estate. MIr. Price adds that he had abundant reasons for believing that both Sir Charles Coote and Mr. Danne and their friends were canvassing a2ainst Mr. Fitzpatrick, though any "positive alliance" or coalition has been denied, and an unnatural and new-bern aym th for Mr. Dunne's political status has been Apropos of tenant coercion, the Derry papers publ a curiousdocumentintheform of apetition, which was presented the other day to the Marquis of Wateiford from his lordships tenantry in Londonderry, humbly beseeching leave to vote as their consciences dictated at the then approaching contest for the county. The petitioners say:- "That they are inclined to believo yonr lordship is warmly attached to the tenmtry on your lordship's estate, nd t you resPect their feelings nd conscientious couvictions i thati acting under that belief, they respectfully ap. p...-- your lordship to request you will be racio0sl pleaed to permit them, at the approaching generaelection, to record their votes according to the ditates of their oon. sciences; and that you will give directions to your agent and representative here to protect them in the rel ous and faithfl exerse of their electr hs severallandlords in-this county have ead done so. this favour being so reasnable arequest on, their prt, yonr tenants do not anti. dpate a refusal, and have nominated eesr. 4c., a deputation to waiton your lordship, and they, s in duty bound, will ever pray."

Thus, as yet, the Derbyite promise of a colleague for Xr.

The Tablet of this day contains a curious satemaent or explanatlon of the means by which Mr. ex-Sheriff Swift was ignominiouly defeated in his late attempt to win back the good graces of his late constituents of the county of Sligo. The majority of simple people had hoped'that the " Steel Boys" conspiracy belonged to an age long past, and were quite unprepared for Its revival in order to thwart the ambition of so fifth-rate a politcal personage as the ex-member for Sligo. The admission of the declie and fall of the M'Hale empire in the west is now freely made upon authority which cannot be disputed "In Sligo (says the TaUde) 1r. Swift was defeated mainly, wve believe, by the terrorism exercised by one of those illegal confederacies which have long been the curse of this country. The 'Steel Boys,' branch of the Riband- aen, enjoy a species of way in tt ounty, and seem, for some reason or other, to be favoured with tne countenance, or at least the connivance, of persons In authority; otherwise it seems hard to imagine howthey oould carry on their nefaious proceedings undisturbed. The leaders of these ruffianly gangs expect to be liberall subsidised by the popular candidates at elections, and the night before the nomination a demand was made on Mr. Swift for a large sum to hire the mob of Sligo, in order to obtain a hearing at the hustings. This demand Mr. Swift firmly and indignantly rejected. Other demands, amounting to thousands of pounds, were made from dmilr quarters, and threats of personal violenoe were used to enforce them. Mhally, although Mr. Swift had obtained the express approval of the Archbishop of Toam, the Bishops of Achory and aRiula, and of the clergy of the whole county, Mr. John Ball was brought down from Dublin to supplant him, and much to the surprse of all except those cognisnt of the intrigue, appeared in Sligo a few hours before the commencement of the proceedings. The nomination was a soene of the most outrageous violence; the mob of Sligo surpassed itself on the occuion. After the nomination, a meeting of the clergy was held, and the following resolution pased : " That the clergymen present, deterined to use their best exertions to secure the return of Mr. Swif cannot too stronclr expe their dimpprobation of the conduct of Mr. John Ball, in obtrading himself on this county, teareby contemptuosly tamulpng under his feet the adoption of ir. Swift by ihe bhibepe and clergy; and furthermore pledge themselves to use their utmost power to prevent the return of MrEBaIL' "In spite of this resolution of the clergy, theWhig party persisted in putting forward Mr. Ball, though without any hope of success, and without any other object than that of dring r. Swift from the field, and thus sacrificing the county to the Tories. Having firmly refused to subsidise the ' Steel Boys,' Mr. Swift found himself exposed to threats of violence from these ruffians, and by the advice of his friends determined on leaving Sligo without waiting the result of the polling. Before leaving he addressed a note, of which the following is a copy, to each of the clergy 'Tallant's Hotel Bligo, Palm Sunday, 1857. Dear Rev.SIr,-Wben offered the representation of osher oeuntlei I promised the bishops, and picularly the Archbishop of Toam, that I would not leave S13go; and, relying on the OD-operation of the clergy, I have made arrngements which wil give all honest electoes an op. portunity of recording their votes. It now rests with them to at their parts-I have done mine honestly. Hearing in mind tihe rather desponding feelings of some of the dergy, and acting on their advice, I do not deem It prudent to Incur the expense of cars and houses, but there Ia nothing that I am aware of to prevent those who are really desirous of supporUng the Independent principles which I have always consistently advocated manfuly to walk into the several booths to record their votes for mnc as I hbave paid all the leeal charges of the sher " 'I remaiu, dear Rev. Sir, your fathf al servant, r I cnr,1 Smv=.' "In accordance with this communication the pollUwas opened for Mr. Swift, and a few of his personal friends recorded their votes. Many of the clergy and people, however, determined to punish Whig treachery in a more exemplary manner by voting for the Tories, who, in consequence, were returned by overwhelming maiorities."

The Woodcote sailed in October last for Hobart Town, and the Ambrosine in November for Launceston. The sooiety have thus shipped 149 single women, six married couples, and 29 children.

The three shipments comprised in all 191 souls. Several letters have been received by the relatives of the girls embarked in the Woodcoce, which vessel arrived at Hobart Town on tle 29thDecember, after a voyage of only 84 days. The writers all speak in glowini terms of the country of their adoption, as likewise of the kind attention shown them at the depOt by the colonial officials. All the emigrants were at onoe engaged, there being only four left in the depot the second morning afier the ship's arrival, and their services were bespoken.

I . . ZLA APoPAT. COURT OF OHCRWERY, LRfCOLW'S-fL APtn 12 RODlDAM V. iORn.1Y --TXrn_, tflJo7Mt Lh lORD -fC3cLLojL The appeal in this case came from Vioe-ChanoeUor Wood. who had decided tht the devisee for life of lands devised by the obligor in a bondW not a person whose men of iDterest or acknowledgment of the debt woui d iefeptbe bond alive under the Statute of Limitations (3d and th William IV. chap. 42). The short facts were, that Joias Morley, the testtor in the cause, bY his will in 1826 settled the greater part of his lands on his eldest son (Francis Morley) for life, with remainders over in stict settlement, and died in 1827,. leaving the defendant (J. R. Morley) his executor, with ample means to pay all debts, and charging the debts in exoneration of his princpal lands on particular funds. At the time of his decease the tetator was indebted on a bond in the xem of 3001 and it was to charge his real estates with that obliga tion that the sait was instituted. FrancisMorley, thetenant for life, paid the interest on the bond from the death of the teatator down to his own decase in the year 1847, sinoe which no interest had been paid or any acknowledgmeat made of the debt. Upon the hearing of the appeal the Lord Chanoellor call-i in the assisanoe of two oommon lalw judges-3Mr. Justice Williams and Mr. Justice Crowder. Their Lordabips, after taldng time to consider their decision, came to a conclusion the reverse of that of the ViceChancellor, and a report of their judgment was published in -hc rimea. lAx. Wilcock, Mr. Bagshawe, sen., Mr. Bagsaw, jun., Mr. W. Mf. James, 3Mr. Cairns, Mr. J. H. Pal-mer, and lr, Martindale were the counsel in the cae. The ROD CRAnTCcaLLOR this morning delivered the judgment of the Court, and sid that the question,althongh one of considerable importance and difficulty, was not of a complicated nature. His Lordip then went through the facts of the case, and stated that the point to be determined was whether by the payment of Interest by the tenant for life the bond debt of the tetator was a subdsting charge upon the inheritnce. The queSion turned upon the effect of the 3d, 4th, and Tth clues in the Statte of Limitations (3d and 4th Wlliam IV., elap. 42). He had thought it right, in hearing the appoel, to call in the aid of two common law judges, and he was much indebted to them for their valuable astance. After a matuez conideration of their joint opinlon, he must say that he not only ooncurred with that opinion, but he also agreedwith the reasons given for it. His Lordship, after referrng to the 3d and 4th sections of the Act, and stating that he did not think they affected his view of the cse, said the point minly turned upon the meaning of the 5th ecticn. By tatit wat enactedthat anyacknowledgment of a bonnd debt or yment on aecount would keep alive such debt for a peori of 20 yeas from the date of such acknowledgment or pert payment. Two questions arose tmder the section-first, whether the payment of interest by a tenant for life was a payment -withil the statue ? and, secndly, if it wr agopAymet on accunt , ainet whom did it opernte? Mow, PtheAct did not specfy by whom the payment was to be made, but it was quite clear it could only have mneaut a n intereeted in gWting rid of the obligtion. Was a ~t or life such a-, interested person? ae (the Lord Chancellor) wa clearly of opinion that he Was Then came the question, who were affected by Such payment?2 Did it operate only againmt the party making it, or did it affct all the perso entitled in re minder after the determination of the life estate? Here, agan, he agreed with the pinion of the learned judges that such a payment freod the action generall, ad ketthe debt alive against all persons clai ing an interest n the estae. Originally the bond creditor had a right of action against the whole inheritanoe, and when onoe a devieee had admitted that his only title to the estate was by the devise the creditor had the same remedy a gI, him as he had Against the devisor or his heir. The tenant for life had no power to relieve his life estate from the burden, conse. quently, Any pyment made by him Wa a payment on ac. count within the meaiing of the statute, and affected the whole inheritance. Upon theaegrounds he thought that the Iast payment of interest by the tenant for life kept alive the actionin all its integrit gainst the estate for a period of 20 years from such payment. The judgment of the Vico. Chancellor, dismissng the bill, must therefore be reversed and the uual creditors deoree substituted, The co0ts would be oosts in the cause. ELLIOTT V. NC. This ?art-heard motion by the plaintiff for an issue to try who her the late Mr. Cumming s of sound mind in the month of March, 1.847, was then resumed. Mrs. Cum. muing was found a lunatic by inquisition in the year 1846, but aome short time before her death she obtained leave from this Court to traverse such finding, but the order was of course never prosecuted.

MouRRS were heard in support of the motion. Mr. CARNS and Mr. BURDoN, contra, urged that the Court ouht not to sanction any further litigation, as tho plaintiff bad not shown he had any evidence whatever to dclae the finding of the jury in 1846. That inquiy lasted 16 days and cost 5,OO01. The LORD C11cOE.Ro, without hearing a reply, sid, the plaintiff was clearly entitled to an isue. It was nearly a matter of absolute right, for if the debt had been;a specialtY one instead of a simple contract one, he could hve brought his action, and would have been entitled to judgment against the estate upon showing that it had oome by descent to the peron in possession. Ile (the Lord Chancellor) could not say that the plaintiff ought not to have the same privilege; but, at the aLme time, he must distinctly understr,nd that he took the iaue at the risk of paying thecosts if unsuccessulThere aa pS mdfacie cae inst hi, and, therefore, although it could not be absolutely determined at the p resent moment, he would, if he fled in the action, in all human probability have to pay all the costs.-Ordered accordingly. BUSINESS OY vr COURT, The LoBD CsrHAOXLLOn aid, that it might be for the convenience of the bar to know that on Tuesday next, and duing the remainder of the term, the Lords Justices of Appeal would sit with him to hear appeals. He was desirous that the full Court of Appeal should sit u often as the stato of business would allow, as he thought it was most consistent for the uitors. At the same time such convenience was balanced by the Courts sitting apart, and keeping the business down if there happened to be any arrear, which, however, was not the case at present.

IN BANKRVPTOV.-B PARTE ANDRTON INXT R ANDXRTON. This was the petition of the bankrupt, Mr. William Naylor Anderton, late a merehant and commission agent at gdon-npon-lull, appeing inst a decision of Mr. Commisioner Ayrtcn, of the Leeds Distriot Court of Bankruptoy. The petition stated that the bankruptcy took place on the 15th of October, 185, and that the bankrupt passed his last examination and made a full diclmsure of his estate and effeots. That at public sitting on the 4th of March, 1857, the certificate of conformity was heard, and was opposed by Messrs. Binney and Co., and by Mr. Henry Thompson, creditors, who had proved, and the certificate w granted, but the Commissioner suspended the operation of it for three years, and refused to grant any protection from arrest for six months; and in respect of the debt which had been proved by Mr. Thompson, amounting to 4711. 5s. ld., all protection was refused from arrest, and tho Commissioner ordered that as against that debt the certificate, when granted, should not afford the bank. rupt any proteotion either from arrest or in respect of his property. MKr. AMPHlLITT, on behalf of the petitioner, areued that the condition which the learned Commissioner had annexed to or which formed the closin prt of his judgment, and, therefore, 'Uferentlly to his certifiCate, was one which was w;holy at variance with the policy of tho bankrLpt lawFs, and more especialiv as related not only to the general debts of the bankrupt, oft to one pwtcolar and especial liability. Inr th e f parteHa;nmond" and "Rc Coihane," reported in the 24th and 26th volumes of the Lawo Joural, their lordships, and especially one of their lordships, had expressed marked disapprobation of the practioe of adding such conditions as those annexed to the crtificate which the Commissioner had here mado. In the present caseo the bankrupt was a commission agent at Hull, and In October, 1854, he entered into a joint speculation with Mr. Thompson, wvhose name ws mentioned in the order, to buy certain produce, and the parties agreed that the purchase should be made in the name of the bankrupt only, but for the joint benefit of both. The amount of the venture, c- cording to the invoie price, was 8341, nd the invoices were received by the bankrupt in November, 1854, and he oommunicated that fact to Mr. Thompson, and the latter paid over to him 4171., one-half of the money. Thereupon the bankrupt insured the goods against sea risk for 9 Some time later the bankrupt deposited the shipping papers and the policy with Messrs. Binne and Co., on the 27th of Deoember, 1854, for securing 300 money lent. Very late in the same month news was reoeived, which turned out to be true, that the vessel was totally wrocked and the cargo lost. The policy money would be payable on the 26th of July, 1855. On the 20th of January, 1855, tho bankrupt borrowed 100L more of Binney and Co. on the same security. Mr. Thompson aftervards went to the bankrupt, syin he was in want of money. and proposed to draw a bill for 4501., his halt of the policy money, andthisbithebwnkmnpt accepted, and then by his affidant he swore that he thence. forth coDsidered that Mr. Thompson relied upon the biU rather than upon the policy money.

The agreement in question was dated the 21st of March, 1839, and was, as far as ix material, as follows.-" The business to be assigned to John Hartley, who shall pay to tho said William Hooker the suma of 1,0001- for the bouts or vesels andligters now used in the. sid busines, with the riggings, decks, masts, and sails, sack9, and every other matter and thing belonging to them, and their stock in trade of timber, rafts, coals, and other things, at the value named in the invoices thereof, with the charges of labour thereupon to be paid as follows:-Price of coals settled by referenee. John Hartley to have the lease of the remises in which the business is carried on for the term of 4ears, under the yearly rental of 1801.; and to have the chice of purcha-sng the same at a sum not exoeeding 4,0001. at the end of the term, or sooner if the said William Hooker should wish to dispose thereof; the usual covenants and restrictions to be contained in such leae on the part of the lessee and the usual covenants to be contained in the t fer or tho said business as is usual on the like occasions. Mr. artleyto have entire 0oseion at Old May-dey next." John. Hartley paid the l, 1. for the vessels, &c., and also paid for the stock in trade under the agrcementl and entered into posseasion and carried on the busmnss. Wlliam Hooker died on the 18th of August, 1839, having made his will, dated on the 15th of such month, whereby, without referring to the property at Lincoln, the subject of the lease, he gve to trustees all his messuages, &c., at Nettleton and Kidde Rsen, and also all other his real estate, andalso all his leaseholds, and the residue of his furniture and other his personal estate, uorn certin trusts to pay debts, &e., and then in favour of his two daughters, the plaintiff, and the defendant, Mary Hooker with a residuary gift to them as tenants-in-common of 'ia sid personal estte. John Hartley filed a biU for specific ,erformanco of the agreement, and a lease ws granted to him under the direc. tion of the Court, saying nothing about the option to pur chase, and when the 14 years elapsed he claimed such option y petition in that suit, and an order was made by his Honour that the premises should be conveyed to him, which was done accordingly, and the 4,0001. paid to the surviving trustees of the will; and the question was whether that s£m wasto be regarded as a realty or personalty? Mr. BAnY and Mr. F. NALDNR , for the plaintiff, contended that it was stiUl personalty, on the authority of the case of "L Awes v. Bennett" (1 Cox, 167) and other cases. Mr. HEuG appeared for the trustees. Mr. GLAsss and Mr. G. WTT TT csox, for the defendant, Mary Hooker, arged that it was realty, it being clearly the testator's intention not to include it in his personalty. The VIC a"CH.cZOR, without calling for a reply, said it was clear that Hartley had a right to compel performance of the agreement so far as the 14 years lease s concerned, and to have the choice of purchasing at a sum not exoeeding 4,0001. at the end of the term. Stopping there, Hartleyhad a right to say, " If I offer 4,000, you must sell to me" then came the words, "or sooner, if the said William Hooker should wish todisposethereof;" and the qcuestionwaswhether those words were limited to their oonnenon with the words, "or sooner," as with the prior passage, "for 4,0001. ? That appeared to his Honour not to be so; the meaning was that there should be an option to purchase at the end of the term for 4,0001.; but before the end of the term, if Hooker was wlling to sell, there was no dou,bt whatever on the oonstruction of the agreement. His Honour then referred to the will, and observed that the agreement as to the reference to the said personalty was legitimate; but, on looking at the anteoedent referred to, the words describing personalty were general, and no assistance could therefore be obtained from the will The order of Deoember, 1853, which directed the conveyance of the premises according to the terms of the agreement, disposed of any question upon that agreement- and therefore the only question now was whether the 4,0601. was realty or personalty? If this had been a ra integra, he (the Vioe-Chancellor) would have had great dotbt, and he could not help saying that great inoon. vemence might result from deciding that it was personalty; for the effcmt might be that a devisee of real estate was not only liable to have suoh real estate converted into personalty after the lapse of many years, but actualy taken away from him; but if the hit bad been distinctly decided by so great a judge as Lord. Xenyon, and that had been followred by lord Eldon. although he expreased some dispprobation of the principle, his Honour was bound by that case, whatever his personal feelingznight be. Moreover, Lordl St. Leoard's had recently a-ssmed thiat to be the law. The question, then, was whether this cas ecould be fairly and honestly, on principle, digtinguished from that case! He thought niot; andrthe sum in question was, therefore, persnaty. Costa out of the fund. VmCJOtr fc-Chancdlor Sir Joh STUART.) nARYISO1 V. THE CORPORATION OP SOUTTHAPTON. Mr. MALMThs appeared in support of a petition by the tintiff for the paynent out of a fund in oDurt of a sum of w 19& 6d, Lhe amount of the fees and expenses due to and incurred by a special examiner, who bad been appointed by the Court to take the examination of oertain witness in this ce. The question in the cause was as to the validity of a bequest of personalty amounting to about 102,000 to the sayor and Corporation of Southampton, for the purpose of founding a public institution in that town for the ptomotion of science and art, and a special examiner had been appointed for the purpose of taking the examination of witneses in relation to inquiries directed by the Court as to the domicil of the testator in the cause at the time of his death. The special examiner had been engagei 14 days in London and 43 days in Paris in examining witnees on the before-mentioned inquiries, and his fees and expenscs amounted to 636l1 19s. 6d. The plaintiff, who was the testates executor, now prayed for an order directing the payment of that mn to the speial e. miner, a he (the exeoutor) had no funds ih hishds out do which to pay the amount.

COURT OF QUEEIJS BENCH. WFSTMIUSTER. APRIL 18. BIRCI; (PUBLIC OFFICER) V. JURY. (SiUings in Banco, before Lord CANIPBELL and Justtes WIGIITMAN. ERLE. and CROMPTON-I. ,oir X. ALLUi,5iW movea ior a riLe to tOSow ACuse why the verdict found for the plaintiff, with Is. damages, should not be set aside, and a new trial granted, on the ground that, if the verdict was not perverse, it waS an inconsistent verdict and contrary to the direction of the learned judge, Lord Campbell, who tried the cause. The defendant, Jury, was a surveyor and auctioneer, and the action was brought against him by the public officer of the Liverpool and London Fire and Life Assurance Company, to recover damages for negligence in surveying certain property, and recommending it to the plaintiff's comany7 as a good security for the advance of a sUm of 7,6004. The property had since been found to be worthless, and was thrown on the plaintifs hands, and the money was lost. The money was advanced by the company to a person named Howard and it appeared that out of the money so advanced the defendant had got a debt of 5251. repaid to him by Howard. The same property had been a short time previoasly mortgaged for 3,0001., and the mortgagees, wvhen aplied to for that purpose, had refused to make any further advances on the security. But only a fewrmonths after thls the defendant recommended the property as a good security for 7,5004 Several witnesses were caUed for the plaintifs, vwho variously estimated the value of the property at 3,7004 and 5,2001. On the part of the defendant several witnesses were examined, one of whom, who had only seen the property three months previously, valued the property at 8,0001., and spoke of the great advantage which would result to the property from a projected railway. The learned counsel said that, as there was conflicting evidence, hecould not have complained of the verdict, if the jury had found for the defendant; bhut, as they had found for the plaintiff, they expressed their opinion that there had been negligence, and in that case the jury ought to have found their damages ancording to the rule laid down for them by the learned Lord Chief Justice. Instead of adopting that course, the jury had found for the plaintiffs, with only Is. damages. rd CALPBELL said the verdict was not satisfactory, and the learned counsel might take a rule to show cause. Rule n4i grnted. HrEALD V. PICKERSGILL. Mr. KNOWES, Q.C., moved, pursuant to leave reserved, for a rule to show cause why the nonsuit which had been entered should not be set asde, and the verdict entered for the plaintiff. The action was on a policy of insurance effected upon coals from Newcastle to Constantinople. The claim was for a total loss. It appeared that the vessel, having got beyond the bar at Newcastle, struck; but, being unable to return, was obliged to lie out, which would be dangerous, ot to go on. It therefore went on, and came into the Thamnes in such a state that it was found to be not worth repairiun. It was therefore condemned and sold. Sofar as the ship -was concerned, therefore, there was a total loss. The owners then got the coals out of the ship in the usual way, by shovelling them into baskets, shooting them into lighters, and depositing them in heaps on land. By these operations the coals got so much broken that they were qulte worthless in the Constantinople market, where coals would only be valuable as steam coal, for -which lumps were required. Under these circumstanecs the coals were sold in London, and fetched Is, a-ton less than the usual price of Newcastle coals in London. The learned counsel said that if the coals had been taken to Constantinople they would have sold for less than the cost of taking them there. Lord CAa5PBELL.-The effect would be that it must be a losing adventure. lr. KNOWLES said he therefore submitted that this amounted to a total loss. The cases established that when a cargo is placed in such a condition that the cost of carrying it to the port of destination is greater than it will sell for that amounts to a total loss. Mr. Baron Martin, who resided at the trial, which took place at Newvcastle at the last asslzes, directed a nonsuit, but gave the learned coinsel leave to make this motion, which he had done accordingly. ord CAMPBELL said the learned counsel might take a Rule nisi granted. PACKR 'V. WINTERBOTHAM AND ANOTIIER. Mr. KEATING, Q.C., moved for a rule calling upon the plaintiff to show cause why the verdict found in his favour, with 3501. damages, should not be set aside and a new tril granted on the ground of surprise, excessive damage, and that the verdict was against the evidence. The action was in detinue to recover a deed of transfer of a mortgage, upon which the plaintiff had advanced 8001. At the trial which took place at Glocester, before Mr. Justice Crowder at the last assizes, it appeared that the elder defendant had been for3 years in practie as a solicitor at Cheltenham. In the month of August last, wishmg to establish his son, also a solicitor, in business, he purcaed for him an interest in the business of a Mr. Thomas, a solicitor at Tewkesbury. At that time Thomas was town clerk of Tewkesbury, and was generally confided in, but on the 2d of October last he left Tewkesbury, and there was now no doubt that he had committed great frauds. The plaintiff had given Thomas the sum of 8001., to be laid out on mortgage, and Thomas had delivered him a paper, showing that he had laid out the money on three different securities, one of which was the one now in question. It turned out that Thomas had converted the 800I. to his own use, and had paid off the mortgagee with the ,um of 3501., which he had obtained from the bank on a deposit of the deed. The plaintiff stated that when he T.slled at the office for the deed the defendant,, Mr. Winter.ttham, said he should have his deed; whereas Mr. Winterbotham himself said that he had said he would apply to ThoTnas, and if Thomas had it the plaintiff should have it. The learned counsel contended that the evidence given by the plaintiff and his witnemses could not be relied upon, con. tradicted, as it was, by the evidence of a gentleman like the defendant, who had been in respectable practico for 30 years. Lord CAIr1aELI, in reference to the frauds stated to have been committed by Thomas, observed that he was sorry to sa.y such practices were but too common, but that if the law should pass which was contemplated in the last two sessions by both Houses of Parliament such a breach of trust would become a crime and punishable with great severity. The learned counsel might take a rule to show cause. Iin,s nisri gra,nted. 'IfE QUEEN V. TIE CORPORATION OP LVBRPOOL. 3fr. EDWARD JAMES, Q.C., moved, pursuant to leave reserved, for a rule to enter the verdict which had been found for the Crown on the 4th count for the defendants. It appeared that an Act of Parliament had been passed au. thordring the corporation of Liverpool to supply that town with water. The Act gave power to divert roads, and to substitute others, and this indictment was preferred against the corporation for neglect to make about 700 or 800 yards of a substituted road of the width required by the Act. The learned counsel now contended that there had not been any breach of duty, and that the indictment was premature, as the time limited for completing the roadbhd not esired. Iex rdCAnirsBz said there was no sufficient ground for disturbing the verdict found for the Crown on the 4th count. The question raised was on the construction of the 100th section of the Local Act, which required the corporation-to make the substitated roads " as shown and laid down in the said plans." The plans referred to were supposed to be included in the Act of Parliament, and showed the width of the ro&d as well as the course it took. He (;ord Campbell) waa of opinion that it was the same as if the plan haa been set out on the face of the Act of Parlia. menie requiring the road to be of the width described. The intention of the Legislature had therefore not been 2ulfled . If the indictment had been preferred while the corporation were making the road, or considering whether it should be made of one width or of another, it would have been rPremature; but it wvas not, preferred till the road was completed, and the corporation had said they had done all they intended, and had insisted that they had complied wiith the Act of ParLiamuent, He (Lord Campbell) was of opinion that the co otadon had violated tho duty cast upon them, and that thiey were liable to the indictment. Mr. Justice WIGHTmAr, and Mr. Justice ERLE expressecl themselves to the sarne effect. Rule refused. nBIBTDGB V. TATTBM8,U-L Mr. EDWIN JAMEns, Q.C., moved for a rule to show Cause why the verdict found for the defendant should not be sot aside, and a new trial granted, upon the ground of misdirection. The action was brought against the Sheriff of Rent for not levying on the goos of one Dr. Lang, under a writ of execution. The defendant pleaded that there were no goods which he could seize. At the tril, which took place before Mr. Justice Cresswell at the last Kingston Assizes, the defendant obtained a verdict. The question was as to the effect of an interim order of protection on a writ of execution previously lodged with the sheriff. It appeared that on the 14th of January, when the writ was lodged with the sheriff, Dr. Lang was living in a house at Broadstairs, but the writ could not be executed because he barricaded the house. But on the 27th of January he got an interim order for protection, and having shown it to the sheriff's officer he on the same day opened his house. The question turned on the construction to be put on the 1je. sec. of the 5th and 6th of Victori;, cap. 116, which enacted that such order should be a protection to the insolvent " from all process whatever, either against his person or property Lord CAMPRXLL said, he thought the return was true; there were no goods which the sheriff could seize. Rule refused.

(Sitings in Banco.-Easter TerCB.-Before Lord COief Jus- tice COCKB~URN and Justime CR1swELL, RORWDiaP, and 'WTTT.T~T 'I This was an action tried before Mr. Justice Willes at the Guildhall, in which a verdict was found for the plaintiff for 1201. Mr. COLLIER, Q.C., now moved for a rule for anew trial on the grounds of misdirection, and that the verdict was against evidence. The action was brought to recover damages for a collision in the river by the plaintiff, the owner of a barge, against the defendant, the owner of a river steamer. By the Admiralty regulations it was the duty of vessels meeting each other in the river to port their helms. There was evidence that the steamer's helm was not ported, neither was that of thebarge and, being in pa-i delicto, the learned counsel contended the plaintiff could not recover, and the jury ought to have been so directed. There was also levidence that the steamer's helm was ported.- Rule nis. granted on both points. WOOD V. LAYTON. This was an action tried before Mr. Justice Willes, whett a verdict was found for the defendant, with leave reserved to enter it for the plaintiff. It was an action for goods sold and delivered, with a plea of never indebted. Mr. O'MALLEY moved for a new trial, on the ground that the learned judge ought to have directed the verdict to be entered for the plaintiff. The plaintiff is a hop-merchant in Crutchedfriars, and the defendant is a brewer at Middlesborough, in Yorksbire. In October, 1855, the plaintiff received an order from the defendant for a quantity of hops. The plaintiff's traveller, it appeared, had taken tho order when worse for liquor, and the jury were of opinion that in point of fact there had been no order for the goods, but there had been a snbsequent acceptance. On this finding the learned counsel ceontended the verdict ought to have been returned for the plaintiff.-Rule nisi granted. WOOTTON V. DAKXiNS. This was an action tried at Leicester before Mr. Justice Wghtian, when the plaintiff was nonsuited. Mr. MnLLO, Q.C., now moved to set aside that nonsuit. By accident the learned counsel' papers had got mixed, and he bad moved the case in the Queen s Bench by mistke, and that Court had refused the role. The action was brought under the 7th and 8th of George IV., chap. 18, against the defendant for setting up a spring gun or implement calculated to destrov human life in his gden whereby the plaintiff bad been inJured. It appeared the plaintiff had had a bantam fowl given to him, whic had escaped, and after various attempts to reain it he heard that it was roosting in a tree in the defendant'sgarden, which adjoined his own. Without asking the leave of the defendant, the plaintiff and his man got a ladder, with which they got over into the defendant's garden. The bantam then took refugo in some thick bushes; and while the plaintiff was stooping, with his head down, looking into a ush for it, a violent explosion close to him knocked his hat off, singed bis eyebrows, hurt his thumb, and frightened away his man. At the exDlosion the defendant came down from his house with a biace of pistols in his hand and threatened to shoot him. The plaintiff, being confused by what had happened to him, wanted to know how he was to get out. The defendant seized his hat, which was on the ground, and, throwing it over the wall said, "There, follow that, that's the way out." The defendant, it appeared, had some fine peaches, which he was anxious to preserve, and had set some contrivance to make a loud explosion if any one trespassed in his garden. The question was whether this was calculated to do serious The C'BF JUsTIE.-TJnlesJ the plaintiff had put his head cloie to it, it wvould have done him no injury. Mr. Justice CREssWXij.-He appears to have sustained as much injury as the implement was calculated to do. Rule refused. LINDS V. ROBE]iSON. In this caso Mr. Serjeant SHEE moved for a new trial oh the ground of surprise. The action was brought for money paid to the wife of the captain of a ship named Wood, by he plaintiff. It appeared that Wood had been employed by t a defendants under a written contract as master of a ship chartered by them, and he had, as aleged with the sanction of the defendants, given a written order to the plaintiff to pay half his wages to his wife, which the plaintiff had done. The learned oounsel now moved, on affidavits by David Ewing and James Robertson, two of the defendants, denying this authority, which was the question in the cause. Rule 7ici granted. DELANE V. FOX. This was an action tried before Mr. Baron Martin at York, when a verdict was found for the plaintiff. Mr. KNowiLS, Q.C., now moved, by permission of the learned Judge, for a rule to set aside that verdict, and to enter it for the defendant. The action was brought for breaking into the plaintiff's house at Bradford. The question raised in the cause was whether the plaintiff held the house in question under the defendant as tenant, or under a Mrs. Knowles, and whether he was not estopped from disputing his landlord's title if he held under the defendant. Rule nisi granted. Mr. CLEASBY also obtained a rule in the same case to enter the verdict for the plaintiff on the second plea, which alleged title in the defendant to the Property, on the ground that tho defendant was wrongfuly i posses. eion..

The action was brought by Mr. A&ndrews, coachbuilder, of Southampton, against the defendant, a gentleman living in Devonshire, for the rice of a pony phaeton, which it was agreed should cost 9d. The defendant, after various letters with the plaintiff, had entered into a oontract with the plaintiff to have the cam but, reserving to himself power to reject it if not made according to his taste. The C xrx Jusro.-You say, however capricious, he was entitled to refuse it? Mr. SMI'rr.-If his objection to it were bond fide.

The plaintiff who keepsa portmnanteau shop in the Haymarket had received the bil, which was for 501., bonid lde in his trade, from a,person named Mller. The defence set up was that Miller had forged it. The defendant, a clerk m the Post-office, swore he had never accepted the bilL Miller swore that he saw him accept it, and a person named Goold swore to the defendant s handwriting. The jury, however, believed the defendant, and fixed one witness with forgery and two with perjury. The learned counsel now read an affidavit of a man named Somers, who said on the 1Ith of April last he went with Goold and the defendant to try and get the bill discounted. The learned counsel had also a further affidavit of a person who heard one of the jurymen say mn the box that "nothing should ever induce him to believe that a Post-office clerk at 761. a-year salary would put Es name to a bill for 501bu no-year salary woud put. hi The COURT granted the r-ule on the grounds of sarprise and of fresh evidence, but not on the last affidavit.

The plaintiff was called in support of this statement. On being oroes-examined, he ayid the PrinOe of Wales Club was a gaminghouse. He had been there frequently. He did not know who kept it. There were a great many persons who appeared to le working there, but he did not mow themn. 1-Le was not there every night. He might go once or twice a month.

Semzieant B3A LArnTqy, in addressing the jryo behalf of the defendant, contended that th. story tZoldb the plaintiff was mnost improbable, and ought not to be believed. The defendant bad not appeared in the witness. box, because he did not wish to disgrace his family by having all his past actions raked up for the amusement of the puablic. He trusted that t-he jury wotuld give their verdict in favour of the defendant. Mr. Baron WATSONT, in summiing up, said, he considered it cast mnuch more disgrace and diahonour upon the defendant's family for, him to have instructed his counsel to imputeperjuy and heatieto th plaitiffwihuben

Youngs fellows of determined apParance, were charged with having entered the premises of Mr. Ford, woollen warehousemnn, in Friday-street, for the purpose of committing a felony. W. Lan ord, a porter in the service of the prosecutor said he hauseen the prisoners watching the premisee, na they soon afterwards went into the lobby, the outer door being closed upon them. He went in and asked them what business they had there, and in consequence ot their unsatisfactory answers he gave them into custody. Upon one of them a kIcfe was fouand, which he was trying to conceal, and a hole labout six inches long hid been cut in the side of The prisoners sda they had entered the premises of the prosecutor to inquire for a friend. The LOnRD KYoR ordered the prisoners to be confined and kept to hard labour in the City Gaol at Holloway for tiwo monLhs each.

Iouis Vincent, formerly town traveller to Mesrs. DefHes glass manufacturers, Houndsditch, was charged with embezzlng 8O1. belonigng to his employers. It appeared from the evidence that it was the dutv of the prisoner to attend at the warehouse from Sunday till Thursday, while on Friday a nd Saturday he was allowed to take oroers and collect money, for which he was to account on the followimng Monday. About a fortnight ago he absented himself from the warehouse without permission, and as he did not return inquiries were instituted, which resulted in the discovery that he had received various sums of monev on account of his employers, for whichhe had not accounted On the 9th inst. the prosecutors received afrom him the following letter.- "GeUeen,Ralngba th msfotue,on Thda ltst, to Imee omnyaelsd ot forae before *The prisoner, when called upon for his defence said, I admit hving received the who e of these moneys, but not being a servant on any of the days on which I received them (Friday and Saturday) I consider it only to be a debt, as my engapmet with the prosecutors was from Sunday to Thursday m each week. Therefore I consider that the charge of eiabezilemeut cannot bo supported. The LORD MAyon.-Your defence is rather too clever and will not, I think, have much weight with a jury, at 4i eventa, I shall send you for trial. The prisoner was then fully committed. GunDTAT.-Robert Watson was placed at the bar before Sir R. W. CnADE and Alderman HALF, charged with uttering bad money under the following peculiar circamstanoes:- It appeared that the prisoner had on many occadons sent :ttle children into various shops with counterfeit halfcrowns to purchase small quantities of butter, eggs, cheese, &o. In this 3stance the g=oos so purchased were found upon the prisoner, together wnth the change from four halforowns, 'which had been pased at a shop newly opened. There was Iao one case in which the prisoner had tendered a bad florin inament for some watercresees, but as the coin was deteed therisoner did not aucceed in getting the chane. Sldr RX w CDigN~ said this was the worst case of the kn that had ever come uAnder his nol Ice, for the prlisoner da4 Jeopardized thne eharacter of several poor little ehili ren, who, but for his timely apprehension, would, In aUl pnebablity, have suffered the penalty fo. an offencothaA was not thei own. He therefore conmitted the prisoner for trial upon three separato charges. William Dawaon, a butcher in Newgate market -Was summoned for exposng meat for sale that was ;uA tfor human food. Mr. Fisher, one of the inspectors of the market, stated that be Baw a quantity of meat cut up into joints and exposed for sale on the defendant's stall, but it was i asuch a state from diserse that it was totally unfit for food. It was so bad that no one could have been deceived by it, although he found some difficulty in detecting it, because it was mixed up with a quantity of good meat. The defendant said when he bought it he was told it had been psamed by the inspectors. He gave 2id, per lb. for it. Sir MM W. (AaDEN- maid it was necessary to exercise the greatest caution under existing circumstances in order to prevent the sale of diseuased meat. If this had not been the tirst complhint against the defendant he should have ordered Iimtobeindictedat the sessdons, for the public werenotto be poisoned by such parsons as the defendant for the sake of pecuniay gain. He then fined the defendant 20s. and costs, or indefaut14 days' imprisonment. 3 ames Jackson, a butcher of Newgate market, was fined 20s. and costs for a similar offence. BOW*STME:.-Ellen Wilson was charged with stealing plate, valued at 301., and a gold ring, the property of her employer. She was fully committed for trial. WxssmtrsM-John WCarthy, a fellow well known to the police, w inally examined charged with burglariously I nd enterng a flat %t 67, Victoria-street, and tealing a timepiece and other property, consisting of plte, dresses, and oteer aeticles to a considerable amount. William Coles 72 B, stated that at about 3 o'clock on the morning of the 4th inst. he saw the prisoner, who was accomeaed by two other men, carrying an empty sack. In about 20 minutes afterwards he met the prisoner alone with hhe sack well filled upon his shoulder. He inquired what he had ,tt there, when he replied, " Only some market things. lhe witness insisted upon seeing what the sack contamedi, when theo prisoner threwr it down, and deliberately tripping witness up, took to his heels. He was, however, pursued by another constable and captured. The sack, on ieng examined, was found, iilled with very elegant female wearing appare and other articles, amounting in value to Sarah Pasterley, servant to Mr. Boyd, who occupies a second-floor flat at 67, Victoria-street, stated that the place was secure when she retired to rest on the night of the 3d, and on the following morning she found it had been entered and a wardrobe completely zansacked. It seemed that the thieves had obtained an entrance by the kitchen. Witness identified the property produced. Prisoner told a long rambling story of how he had spent the night, in the course of which he endeavoured to con. wince the magistrate that he icked the sack up full of what he supposed to be " greens" ithe street, He was fully committed for trial, WORsHIr.SThRnE.-Tolii Kelly, a stout-built young Irish fe?low, recognized by the police as a well-known bsd character about Golden-lane, St. Luke's, was charged before Mr. HAMs3 with the following audacious robbery. . M. LuelenEenaud, who has something to do with thae corn trade, and resides in Greek-street, Soho, was on his way to Mtark-lane upon business, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the afternoon, when upon reaching Chiwell-street the prisoner and three or fourotherfellowscamebefore him, andone made some loud remark, which, although he could not understand it himself, from his not speaking a word of English, seemed to produce an extraordinary effect upon the persons pawn., all of whom i ntl , till they collected into agood szed crowd, and in less than a minute he found every eye fixed uon him in indignation, and that he could not move, from te threeatening gesticulations of those around him. He appealed earnestly to his accusers to tell him what he had done, but.asthe appeal wasinF3rench,itseemedunfortunately only to strengthen their conviction against him, and he was atlast well mgh at his wit's end as to how he should escape from his danger, when, to his great relief, a constble made his ILn ce, forced his way through the crowd, and p?ce himwlf beside him. The constable spoke to the crowd, the crowd spoke tothe constable, and the witness demanded of the offlicer some explanation and protection, but the latter was unable or unwilling to aff0ord either, and was istening to what the crowd said, when all of a sudden witness felt a sharp jerk at his Breguet watchchain, and in, stattly missed his gold watch, which had cost him 250f. in Paris. The act was so sudden he was astounded for a moment, but instinctively grasped the prisoner, who was the nearest to him on one side, as the constable was on the other, and at the same instant his watch dropped on the pavement behind him and the prisoner was seized by an officer. -This was all of the affair that was Imown to the prose. cutor, who gave his evidence through an interpreter, but the real explanation was given byLarney and Browsing, two constables of the G division, the former of whom stated that upon getting up he found the Frenchman in great perplexity and trouble with the crowd, to whom he was appealin with outstretched arma, but uselessly, and Witness therezore asked them what was the matter. The crowd all said the prowecutor had been detected in the act of trepanning a girl only 14 years old from the house of her parents, but, though all of them seemed to believe this, no one seemed to know which person had seen him do it. He told the Frenchman what he was accused of, and he took no notice of it, but went on talking just the same, though this, perhaps, might arise from one talking in French and the other in English, ana neither understanding what the other one said. He did his best, however, to make the prosecutor comprehend hnn, and was slowly impressing the matter upon him, when he abruptly shouted out, "Ma vatch I" c apped his hand on his waistcoat pocket, and there witness saa,xthe qriner, who had been quietly and attentively staring h in the face all the time, with his fingers entangled in theprosecutor's chain, from the ring of which his watch had been violently twisted. Witness seized the prisoner,whoswore he would do him a deadly injury if he did not let him go; but witness held him, and while doing eo Browing cameup behind and saw the prisoner trying to pass the watch to another man near him, but the other was net quick enough, and the prisoner let it drop on the pavement to prevent itS being found upon him. Both officers expres6ed their conviction that the charge of trepan th Irl was merely an artful device to faclitate the robbter 0ut thegqu etion was nevertheless, through the interpreter, put to the prosecutor, who first exhibited the most blank astonshment, and then denied it indignantly. The prisoner stoutly protested his innocenoe, and was ordere to be committed for trial, but, as a former convic. tion was likely to be fonnd against him, he was remanded till that day week, that it might be adduced CLBXRNwESL.-Margaret Asbum, aged 25, residing at N~o. I, Cherry-tree.court, White Croscs-street, St. LuMkes, was placed at the bar before Mr. Corrie, charged by James Cowan wFith stealing from his person one sovereign, three half-crowns, and other silver, at the house, 8, Type-court, The prosecutor having been sworn, said that he was sojourmng at an hotel, the name of vwhich he did not know, near London-bridge.-On Friday night I was in Cheapside, when I was accosted by the prisoner, who commenoed speaking to me on serious religious matters, which so much Interested my mind and feelings as a "Christian teacher" that I was tempted to encourage and continue the discourse. She said that there was an awful responsibility attached to u3 as far as regarded our conduct in this world. We conversed together until we came to Finsbury, when I gave her a half-crown to get rid of her, but still feel. ing strongly inclined to hear more of her discourse, having been influenced by it to an extraordinary degree, I walked further on with her, when she invited me to acompany her to her own " prnvate" apartments, to which I acceded, and I went with her to the house in Cherrytree-court, where a woman demanded Is. for the room. I suspeoted then what sort of a place I was in. I took out my purse to pay the shilling, 'when the prisoner made a snatch dexterously at te bpuRsedand took it from me. I then gave the prisoner Todd! a poEceman, said three half-crorwns were found on tthe iprsoner, and she swallovwed a sovereign while at the The prisoner said the prosecutor proposed to go with her to her own room. She denied the charge. Mr. CoRnI= said he should remand the prisoner for a week. SOUTHWARL-Mary Comnor, 24, was brought before Mr. :BURCH", charged with stealing two gunny-bags, the property of Messrs. Henry Levy and Co., sack and general merchants, Greenman-granary, Bermondsey-wall, and 70, Mark-lane. Mr. Edward Levy, who attended to prefer the complaint, stated that they had in their employ at Greenman-granary 400 Persons, where there was upwards of 20,0001. worth of property, chiefly consisting of sacks and bags, which they exported daily to the amount of 50, 000 or 60, 000, and about the same number are also sent out for home consumption. Having boen robbed to an enormous extent recently by some of their workpeople he called inthe police on Friday evening, and without any previous intimation, called aU the worI4people into a room prepared for their reception, where three constables and a female searcher were. As soon as they found what was about to take place about 30 of them dropped bags, which they had concealed under their clothes for the purpose of carrying away. The prisoner made a hasty retreat from the prmises, and after she left wines looked 'Ito a larg'otin po-t, used by- -e -obi tea, and found two of theirmbag She was afterwards given into custody, and It was the wish of the firm that she should be punished, as a caution to the others in their employ. Sergeant Upton 18 M, said, he took the pot to the pnsoner's lodging in 5Bull-court, where he found her and she acknowledged it to be her property. EIe then told her that two bgs belonging to her master were found in it, when she sai she was sorry and was willing to pay for them, promising never to do so again. Mr. BuRaMA- told the prisoner that in the place where she was employed a wholesale system of plunder was being daily committed to a very serious extent. Instead of acting honestly towards their employers, they w ere not satisfied without appropriating the property to their owvn use. He must try what a severe sentence wvould do to stop such dejredatious by sentencing her to tw o months hard labour in the House of Correction. IAImErH.-Mlchael Grant, the card-sharpr, taken into cust o for carsharpingin acaripontheSouth-Westem Rallway, on the day of the late boat race, was placed at the bah . Thce was fully proved, and the prisoner declared hw would never play again, and prayed to be dealt with leniently. The MAorsncA hoped that the lightness of the sentence he was about to inflict would have the desired effect. Ho then sentenced him to one month's imprisonment with hard labour. The prisoner's wife was then charged 'With the crime of attempting self-destruction, which she attributed to her being in actual want on aocount of the incarceration of her husband. After a severe admonition, and a promise on her part not to repeat the crime, she was disharged, and the moneys vwhic had been sent to the magistrate for her temporary asstnco were handed to her. Mary Ann Brown, a smart-looking young woman, was placed in the dock before Mr. ELLIoTT charged with burglariously brealdng into the dwellinghoue of Thoma Budd, i6, LionotrCe, Ol Retet-road, and tealing thereinv rios artcls of property. From the evidenoe it appeared that at 5 o'clock on that morning the prosecutor an his wifewore awoke by a noie ' ceassioned by the drawing out of a chest from under thei bed oan which they lay, and on getting out of bed theyI heard some person run downstairs. They followed, and mecured the prisoner as be was appro-aching the front door, 'with some of their property tied ap in a bundle. The prisoner, who deslined offering anything in defnce, I 'was folly conrmnitted for triaL.

The frauds thus practised in different parta of Kent, Surrey, and Middlesex were of a very extenive Character, the prisoners contriving to remove the goods so obtained to some other place during the nighttime, and ma}ding ther disappear aoe. lMr,M XsL saidtshe more numerous cases of fraud by the prisoners had Leea oomTaited in Kent, and wnat he pwposed doing w tol send the prisoners for trial at the next Malidstone Sessions He would also have the deposd.

The carburetted hydrogen gas is generated and accunu. latedchielly ortoagreatextent, ingoavesordesertedworkiir and arts of the mine having closed ends, whence it Issu forx.atinterals, sometimes beingcarriedoffbythegen, ventilation of the mine without producing any ill ects, but oocasionally producing terrific explosions, either from coming in contact with the flme of a naked candle or lamp orfrom some unexplained circumstance. Such accident may and do occur in mines which are oonsidered to be veII ventlated, but if attention be direted to the system of ventiation generaly adopted it will be readily seen that the chief cause of danger is left unprovided for. Coal mines are usually ventil ted by means of dowr,s and npcast sbafts, furac being placed at the latter forthe purpose of promoting a blast of air through the mine, th current being directed through the various workings b means of brattioe3, doors, &c, By this method vast volumui of irare driventhirough the mine, so strong, indeed, a. freqently to extmn nih any naked lights which may be Ia the lin of ventiation. The sources of danger to wch I have alluded remain, however, comparatively untouniced and unaffected by the get body of air thus driven through the principal workng of the mine, until, hving gain power by aorcumulaton, the gas issues forth upo.nits idead mission, spreading destruction throughout the rmie. The ytem of ventilation to which I have alluded is com. paratively useless, so far as the cleansing of these foul per. tions of the mine is concerned, Such spots should be regularly cleared or brushed out at intervals, according to the exigencies of each paticular case, by the introductioc of currents of pure atmospheric air of sufficient power to drive out the noxious gses into the main workings, 'wherm they w be carried one by the general ventilation, care be tkuen tht no neked candles or lamps are exposed in th; Were such Rrecautious taken-and there are vairious mechanical contrivances applicable to the purpose-we should beLr of fewer accidents of such an appalling character as that at Lundhill, andl the proprietors would find the expenaeattendant upon such preventive meares less than that which is entailed y explosions consequent upon the presnt system of management. The Davy lamp was indeed a most valuable invention, but aU must agree WIth your obmervation, that some appaatuz is needed which s insre not only equal safety to the miner, but shall enable him to pursue his underground ope. rations with greater ease and comfort.

AfLITABY AND NHA rAL INTELLIGENOB. I 'Tbe battery of artillery now lying at 19orwich Barracks, Under tha command of Major Arbuthno t, is under orders to proceed to Aldershott. It is expected that the corps, which comprises six gums and 156 men, will proceed thither this day (monday), Theengineer district of Kilkenny has been broken up trom the 1st tf April, although the order for the purpose was onlr received within the past week. Captain Gmz*6tt, B.L, has already left for Cork. The Hon. Captain Bury, R3E, remains in charge of Kilkenny, which is hencoe forth-to be attached to the Curragh district. It having been determined to reduce the artillery force quartered at Ballincollig from three companies to two the company under command of Captain Thompson, numbei-ing 136 rank and file, received orders a few days ago to hold themselves in readiness for the route, and on Thursday uerz ing they were accordingly directed to prepare for their departure. Having started in the afternoon from their quarters in heavy marching order they arrived in Cork at about 6 o'clock, the same evening, in charge of the captcin of the company, and were subsequently billeted tzhroughout the city for the night, preparatory to their departure per steamer for Bristol, cn route to Woolwich, )where they are to join the head-quarters of the Royal Artillery Corps. Her Majesty's State yacht the Victoria and Albert, Captain the Hon. Joseph Denman, has just been taken into dock at Portsmouth to be embellished for Her Majesty's summer cruise. Tho Furious, 16, paddle-frigate, Captain Osborne, C.B., having fitted out for the China station, went out of Portsmnouth harbour to Spithead on Saturday, and there awaits sailing orders. Hler convoy of gunboats is nearly ready. Nhe Firm, Lieutenant Nicolas, -went out of harbour on saturday and took in her powder and shelL The Drake, 4ieutenant Arthur, and Janus, Lieutenant Jones, are ready -or sea. The Melville two-decker, Commander Trollope, "Zting out at Portsmouth as a hospital ship for tho China aBquadron, is nearly complete in her rig. The Amphitrite, 25, Captain Tatham, fitting out at Ports. 'mouth for the Coastguard service, is complete in the rigging department, and will leave the fitting basin this day. The Sylph mercantile steamvessel embarked at Portsmouth on Saturday a company of Royal Artillery, and left with them for Jersey, whence she will return with the depOt of the 72d EHighlanders, A letter from the Pacific squadron, dated the 27th of Yebruary, gives the following movements on that station:- "- The Monarch, 84, flag, is at Valparaiso. Rear-Admiral Bruce arrived at Callao in the mail steamer Lima, and hoisted his flag in the President, 50, Captain Frederick. The latter leaves to-morrow (the 28th) for Enland, when the Tribune, 31, Captain Harry EdgelL, will hoist the Admiral's flag until the arrival of the onarcb. The Tribune bad just returned from the Chinchas, where she had made herself popular, protecting all mercantile interests. All the ldies of the plae attended the Church service on board with their families. The Tribune got up a ply, which went of well; then the American merchant fleet gave a grand banquet to her captain and officers on board a 2,000-ton clipper ship, at which 260 sat down to a banquet. Toasts and speeches followed, and dancing wound up the evening. Trhe 22d.- Washington's birthday, the frigates saluted and dressed ship. On the 23d the Tribune left. On passing through the English merchant fleet they all dressed ship and saluted; it was uite a ala day. The TribuLne returned the salutes, and eAmerican merchant ships returned the salute for Washington's birthday. The Eak, 20, is at Panama; the Havannal, 22, cn routc to Valparaiso; the Alarm, 26, gone to San Bias for freight; the Brisk steamsloop sailed for England the Pearl, 20, at the Chinchas." The iron screw steam gunvessel Miux, Lieutenant-Commander Richard H. Roe, towed up to Woolwich on Friday morning by a merchant steamer, was on Saturday inspected by the Commodore of the dockyard, when the crew was mustered, cleared for action, and went through general quarters. The Commodore was bighly gratified with the discipline of the ship's crew and the gunnery manceuvres. The Yinx made the run from Sierra Leone entirely under canvas, and having fair wind the whole distance she per. formed the voyage in 35 days, and landed the mails off the lizard. The sailing transport Mooresfort embarked her troops on 'Saturday for China,-namely, two companies of the Royal Artillery, Captain Longdon, and Captain Middleton's companies, consisting of 14 officers, and 2S0 rank and Mle of the 13th battalion, together with three complete batteries, 130 tons of reserve stores, and 150 tons of military baggage. The embarcation took place at 2 o'clock, and the vessel was towed down the river from Woolwich pier at ii o'clock p.m., amid the cheers of the numerous persons who had assembled to witness the departure. After the removal of the Mooresfort, the Neleus, which had been several days anchored at the buoy, took up her position to prepare for the embarcation of Captain Knox and Captain lBarstow's companies of the 9th and 10th battalions, who are under orders to embark on Wednesday next, likewise for Hongkong. The Cumberland is put out of No. 3 dry dock and berthed in the fitting basin under the shears, to be masted and rigged. Her officers and crew were mustered on Friday last by Captain the Right Hon. Lord Frederick Kerr, in command of the flag ship Waterloo. The Vesuvius has this day been taken into No. 3 dry dock to have her valves, feed-pipes, and bottom examined. The following officers have taken up their commissions and joined this ship :-Mr. Richard L. B Head, Acting-Assistant-Surgeon. and Mr. William Wallace, Clerk. The Terrible is ordered to be ready by the 31st of May next. She is now undergoing extensive repairs in her hull and machinery. The crew of the Miranda will be paid off at Sheernems tomorrow (Tuesday) The following appointments were made on Saturday at the Admiralty:- LieuteDant W. E. Gordon, to the Melville; Lieutenant Frederick W. Sullivan, of the Castor, Flag-Lieutenant to Rear-Admiral the Hon. Sir Frederick Grey; Richard Onslow, mate, to the Vesuvius; W. A. K. Craven, mate, to the Cumberland; R. Evans, midshipmian, to the Cumberland; C. F. Hotham, naval cadet, to the Cordelia; W. R. Haswell, clerk, to the Himalaya, and Thomas J. Giles, clerk, to the Hastings.
THiE UNITED STATES AND CHINA.-This Chinese quarrel happens to be one of the questions which illustrate our "solidarity" in the family of nations in the most marked manner. We import from China nearly $12,000,000 worth of teas, silks, &c., every year. A large portion of this-the tea--is an absolute necessary of our life, and cannot be foregone or enhanced in price without causing great general annoyance among our people. Now, the effect of the war will be to cut us off from the supply of this necessary. We must either, therefore, do without tea, and wait till the French and English arc pleased to make peace, and graciously admit us to the fruits of their labours, or we must take with thelml the part that belongs to a first-class nation. Any Americancitizen can decide which of the two courses it best befits the country to adopt. But we are not even left to this. Ever since the first outbreak of hostilities our countrymen have been sufferers. We have heard of an American pleasure-boat being fired upon. We have heard of American missionaries ing kidnapped and assassinated. Wo have heard of Armerican vessels so outrageously attacked that they felt it requisite to vindicate their oredit by capturing the fort which assailed them. We have heard of American heads adorning the wall at Canton; and by the very last mail, we learn the lamentablo story of the massacre of Americans on board the ill-fated Thistle. Now, if there be any use at all in a national marine, that use must surely be to vindicate the national honour under outrages of this kind (afid to avenge the blood of our unfortunate murdered oountrymen. Such cases as these are precisely the ones contemplated by the national Legislature, when large sums of money are voted for the equipment and maintenance of vessels like the Niagara and the Mississippi. It seemrs, in fact, so clear that we are bound to espouse the sane cause as the allies-for our own sake-that without a little reflection one can hardl underntaud how the question can ever have been mooted. Here are these Chinese, with a civilization somewhat akin to that of the Mexicans wben Cortez fell upon thein, or still nure to that of the Chaldeans or Babylonians in the days of -Nebuchadnezzar or Senacberib; polished and civilized in their way, but that way a poor one, and clearly destined to give way and disappear on contact with stronger types of civilization; immensely numerous, but totally devoid of the discipline and organization requisite to nialse their numbers available, with a Government highly centralized ama once porfect of its kind, now corrumt and in decay everywhere - vastly rich, but knowing none Qf the great and useful usages of wealth; a great, abAormgl, preposterous anomaly for this world in the 19th century. lpon these Chimese we are dependent for one of our neooesaries of lifo; and they arc not only denying it to us, but ore falling upon <ear people and murdering them wherever they can. But for the friendly shelter of the British fort of Victoria, at Hongkong, we should have had far moreicXsses to deplore. Under these circumstances, we cannot doubt but that Mr.Bnmchanan will direct that hostilities be commenced in earnest against the Chinese. There is perhapahavdly anynecessity for such atreaty as the English and Fronceh -e made, and it uighthamperus without doing any good: but we can fight as well without as with a treaty, and that is the main thing. Not so much that additional .assistance is needed to whip the Chinese, whom no doubt .either England 4 r France could settle single-handed; but because it will lia,ve the best effect among the Asiatics to learn that the three greatest Powers of the world are of the same mind on tiis umatter, and that they will combine to achieve their purpose. This alone would probably induce the Emperor to put.an end tothe war. On every greundpolicv, expediency, justice, and humanity-it would appear that ; bold and eneygetic course on the part of the United States can be recomrmended. We should help to terminate hestilities: we could throw our idfluence into the scale in their favotir were any attempt made to punish -them un4uly; wo could swe that the finalsettlem-nt were *mnadeonot,onlyin ashapebhatpromisedto hedefinite.but in a -form-whieh rendered justice wa well to the Cbinese as to the ,growing interests of our owR pacific possessions. How this policy should be carried into effect is a nmatter for future consideration-, the impossibility oi penetrating the country with success has suggested the selxare of the seaports-only two of which, Cn ton and Sbanglcai, are worth seizing at any rite; tbis, with, perhaps, thenwaupation of OJe or two roads from the tea-growing district tv Shanghai, would he all that might be required, until the BEp,e-ror, satisfied that his Russian friends were of little use at,d that bis enrmies were in earnest, agreed tomake peace, and to plae.his affairs with theworld on a footinguf fair. free.and equsl intercourse for all time to aomurs-Rew York HeIald.
UER MAJ.TSTFS TaBATBE. While the triumphant success of Signor Giuglini Vws confirmed by the third performance of rsi Favorit,, which took place on satirday night, Mademoiselle SpeLia gave evident signs of aa advance in public favour, Those pecu. liarities of voice which somewhat marred her best efforts on Tuesday were far less apparent, and may possibly be explained away on the hypothesis of nervous trepidation. On the other hand, those merits that belong to the histrionic side of the art were more conspicuous than before, and we scarcely desire to see tho last scene of La Favorita acted with more intense expression, 'with more thorough abandon to the passion of the moment, than by Mademoiselle Spezia. There is nothing like cemplacent mediocrity in her performance. Into the spirit of the character she assumes she enters without reserve, mental or physical, and she spares no effort of voice or gesture to realize her conceptions. Thenewdanseuee, Mademoiselle Pocchini, isa mostvalaable acquisition to the theatre. When so much choregraphic excelence has been exhibited to the h<abitu6s of the establish. ment in so great a variety of schools, it might be naturally supposed that the resources of the art are completely e8)hausted, and that the enthusiastic wonder of former days must give way to a calm approbation bestowed on those meritorious young artists who follow conscientiously in the track of some illustrious predecessor. But Mademoiselle Pocchini shows that there was still something which the former luminaries of the ballet had left undone. The difficulties which she achieves and her manner of achieving them are entirely new, awakening no remembrance of schools or their foundresses in any speotators, save some decided veterans, 'who, looking back tbrough a long vista of years, compare her to Heberle. The Trmandaise, as she executes it, is an original creation. By a sudden inclination of the body she seems constantly on the point of touching the ground with her forehead, but so suddenly becomes erect, and is so perfectly at her ease, that you almost question whether the hazardousfeat has been actually performed, or whether you have not rather been under the influence of some optical illusion. Inefficiently executed, these movements would be failures of the most ludicrous kind, but the audacity of MademoisellePocohini is so well tempered with gracefulness, and her manner is so thoroughly expressive of confidence, that her eccentricities have the appearance of a facile sport, while endowed with all the charm of originality. In the pas de cinq. which is introduced in the course of the ballt a separate " variation" is executed by each of the five danseuses-Mesdemoiselles Rolla, Pasqualis, Morlacchi, Brunetti, and Karliski, who, in vying with each other, give earnest of future eminence under more responsible circumstances. The house was filled in every part, and the new vocalists were three times summoned before the curtain. The debat of Mademoiselle Piccolomini is announced for to-morrow (Tuesday), the selected opera being La Figlia del Reggi. menlo._ _ _
SACRED HABMONIC SOCIETY. The oratorio of .uda8 faccaceus-Handel's third greatest work-perhaps never enjoyed so excollent a chanoe of being appreciated as at its first performance this season by the members of the Sacred Harmonic Society. The execution on the whole was the finest to which we have ever listened. Urged to more than ordinary energy by the anticipation of the forthcoming grand "Festival" at the Crystal Palacewhich is to include Judas Maccabcsus as well as the Messiah andIsrael in Egypt-the Sacred Harmonic Society, under the indefatigable guidance of Mr. Costa, has bestirred itself in a manner hitherto unexampled; and it is not too much to say that the performances this year, with one or two excep. tions duly recorded, have surpassed in general excellence anything previously attempted at Exeter-hail. Grand, however, as was, in a more than ustal number of instances, the execution of the unparalleled Irraed, that of Judas Maccazeus was stiUl more striking. From the almost irreproachable style in which the most magnificent and stupendous of the choruses-" Disdainful of danger," " Hear us, 0 Lord" (Part L); " Fallen is the foe" (one of the choral masterpieces of Handel), " Wo hear ! we hear 1" and " We never will bow down" (Part II.); and, last not least, the " Hallelujah" (Part III)-were deHvered, it seemed as if Mr. Costa had either been endowed with a magio wand that enabled him (bopeless task heretofore) to make the whole of the " 600" not only sing, but sing correctly, or, which we have reason to believe still more difficult, to per. suade all those incapable of singing in time and tune to stay away from the concert. Whatever the cause, it is our duty to state the result. The performance of Handerg's Judas was not only of such a nature as to encourage the highest anticipations of the musical treat reserved for the visitors to the Crystal Palace on the second day of the festival, but such as to warrant a belief that this hitherto comparatively neglected chef d'aNuvre may eventually become one of the most attractive pieces in the repository of the Sacred Harmonic Society-which, notwi'thstanding its wonderful choruses and the remarkably dramatic character of the principal airs, has up to this period rather been desired than reali7ed. The solo singers were Madame Clara Novello, Madame Rudersdorff, Miss Dolby, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Montem Smith, and Mr. Sims Reeves. All of these ladies and gentlemen sang their very best; but, as customary in this particular oratorio, the chief share of the honour fell to the representative of the principal tenormusic, to whom the moststriking andeffectiveaisareallotted. Mr. Sims Reevesneversangmore admirably than on the present occasion. The two fine songs, " Call forth thy powers " and " How vain is man," were distinguished by the nicest artistic discrimination, and an acquaintance with the proper mode of rendering the music of Handel which perhaps no other singer of the present time can boast to the same extent. But it was in the fierce declamatory outburst, "Sound an alarm," that Mr. Sims Reeves made the greatest impression. It would not be easy to imagine anything more vocally energetic, and yet at the same time more pure and noble in its simplicity than the delivery of this impetuous air, which raised the audience to the highest pitch of enthusiasm Another piece worth mentioniug was the duet for soprano and contralto, "0 never bow we down" (which leads to the emphatic chorus already named), sung to perfection by Madame Novello and Miss Dolby. The principal bass music was very carefully given by Mr. Thomas, and the performance altogether afforded unqualHfied satisfaction to a vast assembly. The next oratorio-announced for Wednesday, May 6- is Mendelssohn's Blijah.
CAPE MfAILS PER HIMALAYA. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-Permit me through the medium of your columns to caU attention to an act of flagrant injustice on the part of the Post-office authorities. It was officially notified that letters to the Cape of Good Hope posted on the afternoon of the 16th instant would be sent by HE.M. steamer Himalaya, which would leave Portsmouth on the norning of tho 17th instant. In consequence of this announcement there was a heavy mail posted last evening, upon which the Post-office autho- I rities received the postage in advance, at the rate of ls. per hrdf ounce, and this morning I find that the Himalaya, at the time the authorities were receiving this postage, was some 50 or 60 miles on her passage, having left Portsmouth about 1 o'clock in the afternoon. It appears to me, Sir, that in this age of telegraphs the foregoing requires e-o comment, and the inconvenience and loss arising from it to those engaged with the colony are excessive, as it is quite probable that letters posted last ight will not he delivered in the colony for two or three Imonths hence, instead of in aboat 24 days, Ste ol I probably be if sent per Himalaya. as they would ]iequestind your insertion of the within, ___ I remain, Sir, your very obedient servant- OA'EB HERCHANr. xu,FunuoGa srree;, apru 1'(.
REOPENING OF LLANDAFF OATHEDRI.-More than ten years since the restoration of the cathedral church of Landaff began with that of the Ladye Chapel at the eastern end. This was thoroughly accomplished under the auspices of the late Dean (tbe Very Rev. W. B. Knight), who was at the timne of his death meditating the comroencement of the larger worl, which bas been steadily ursued by his successor (the Very Rev. W. D. Conybeare). e presbytery, the choir, and the uufallen portion of the nave have regained their original character by the recon. struction of the cleristory, the removal of the Italian cornice, and the restoration of the roof to its primitive form. The beautiful Norman arch between the nave and tue eastern cbapel has been disclosed to view, while a esuitable reredos has replaced that of Bi:bop Marshall, which was too dilapidated to be permitted to remain. The nave has been laid with encauctic tiles, and appropriate seats have been provided for a eongregatioa, The pulpit and sedilia of a rich design, are still in progress; bnt the whole work was so far advanced as to permit tbhe Dean and Chapter to reopen the cathedral for public worship on Thursday last-a step which was urgently required to provide the necessary church accosmiodation for the growing population of the district. 9,0001. bave alroady neen expended on the restoration, of which 3,348!. were contributed by the late and preseat' Bishop of the diocess, and by individual members of the chapter. The work has been carried on under the direction of Mr. Wyatt and Messrs. Prichard and Siddon, the dii,cesan architects, and the result lis elicited marked approbation. An immense gathering of clergy of the dioceses of Llandafl,St. David's and Glocester and Bristol, and of laity (including the highest cud the humblest classes) a8embled on the occa8ion of. the opening service. bhe sermon, preached by the Rliht Rev. the Lord Bishop of Oxford, from Ezra ix. 9, was an eloquent and ilpreesive discourse, after which a oollectiou was made n aid of the restoration fund, amounting to nearly f0W4.
ROYAL ITALIAN OPBRA. On Saturday night Donizetti's Maria di Rohan was pre. sented, and Signor Ronconi made his first appearance this Season. Although Mfaria di Bol7sn, regarded from a strictly mnii. cal point of view, is one of the feeblest works of its composer, the choice was justified by the celebrity attached to Ronconi's impersonation of the chaacter of Enrico (Duc de Chevreuse). This alone has been instromentalin preserving the opera from oblivion; and no wonder, since, as an individual display of histrionic power, the lyric stage offets few things to surpass it. Donizetti, it is true, seldom rises to the tragic heights of the Situations, and is stiU more rarely on a level with the terrible passions of which the prominent actors are the aport; but what the musio has failed to effect for the drama the genius of Ronconi successfully accomplishes for the music, creating expression out of melodies almost, if not absolutely, commonplace, and attaining a climax at the end which could hardly be grander or more imposing had the lyrical treatment been infinitely worthier of the subject. Every playgoer is familia with the story of 17n Duel sous RBicWidu (upon which French piece the libretto of Maria di Bohaen is founded), and it would be superfluous to describe the plot, but that a brief sketch may help to convey a better notion of the striking merits of Ronconi's performance. M1r di Rohan, although pledged to the Count Chalais, has, for family reasons, espoused the, Duc de Chevreuse, an intimate friend of the other, and a nobleman of chivalrous character. Chevreuse having killed the nephew of Cardinal Richelieu in a duel, Chalais intercedes with the King (Louis XIIL) to obtan his pardon. The opportune disgrace of Richelieu leads to Chalais's appointment as Minister, and his suit is succeacful. His old passion for Maria, however, remains unaltered, and Armando di Gondi, ayoung courtier, havingmade light ue of her name, Chalais challenges hinL Chevreuse, ignoraut of the origin of the quarrel, consents to become his friend's second, and Chalais not arriving at the hour appointed the former fights in his stead, and kiUs his adversary. The cause of Chalais's detention is Maria herself, who visits him privately, and restraina him by tears and supplications. In anticipation of the posdble result of the duel, Chalais has addressed a letter to maria, which by some accident falls into the hands of Richelien. The Cardinal, restored to power, and determined to revenge himself upon both his enemies, has the letter secretly conveyed to Chevreuse, who, opening it, discovers what he accepts as a proof of his wife's dishonour. Meanwhile, Richelieu issues orders for the arrest of Chalais, who is concealed in the house of Chevreuse. The latter, too generous to deliver him to his pursuers, offers him the choice of two pistols in the presence of Maria, who watches the departure of her husband and her lover in an agony of suspense. In the lapse of a moment she hears a report which announces the death of one or both, when the sudden apparition of Chevreuse in a state of mingled exultation and despair reveals the fact that the man of her preference has fallen. The emissaries of Riche. lieu then seize Chevreuse, and the cartain fals. The Chevreuse of Ronconi is from first to last an original and impressive portrayal. In the earlier scenes, before he has reason to suspect his wife's fidelity, or the loyalty of her most intimate companion, the romantic bearing of the nobleman, and the frankness of the devoted friend and lover, are assumed so well that a diminutive figure and a face to which the penetrating eye alone lends expression are forgotten in the commanding talent of the artist When the seeds of suspicion are sown a metamorphosis becomes evident in the demeanour of Chevreuse; and the way in which this is conveyed by Roncon, without exaggeration of gesture or unseemly contortions of the physiognomy (the rock upon which so many tragic actors split), is fearful in its painfuUy suppressed emotion. The look with which he regards Chalais, when picking up and gradually recognizing the mask of Maria, reveals the entire secret thatlurks within the breast of Chevreuse; and the ironical tone in which he delivers the sentence, *Favela, pini sommenso, Potria Ia madre udir"- klmowing all the while that not the mother of Chalais, but Maria di Rohan, his (Chevreuse's) own wife, may overhear the conversation-is alike remarkable for dramatic force and consummate poetical suggestiveness. But all this (and much besides, which we cannot particularize) sinks into nothing in comparisen with the final " tableau," where, by means of the unfortunate letter, the truth is wholly revealed, and Chevreuse, Infuriated beyond the reach of control, only contemplates revenge. The manner in which Ronconi peruses the letter and his convulsive exclamation at the end- "Chs? aria-dessa! e Ricardo- La sorso notte I - Oh rabbs r- were only surpassed by the passionate expression to which he gave vent in the aria " Bella e di sol vestita and even this was exceeded by the agiato, " Ogni mio bene in te sperai," wher the bereaved husband abandons himself to the memory of his lost affection, and the final allegro, " Ah I d'una lagrima il cigio mio," where the now convinced Chevrense resigns himself to despair. The interview with Maria was marvelously acted, and a rapid transition from the extreme of anguish to the pinnacle of triumphant joy, when the appearance of his false friend and rival shows that the long wished-for retribution is at band, disclosed a master-stroke of histrionic art. The brief dialogue with Chalais nnd the last terrible look when, having shot her lover, Chevreuse returns to the presence of Maria, made a fitting climax to a performance which in its way could not be excelled; and which must be esteemed the more remarkable inasmuch as this same Rouconi possesses the secret of convulsing the house with laughter in the burlesque absurdities of Dulcamara, and entertaining it with an example of the raciest comedy in his delineation of the cunning and Protean Figaro. The part of Maria di Rohan is one of such eminent dramatic interest as to warrant surprise that it has never been a favourite with artists of the first rank, who invariably shirk it-a manifest injustice to Renconi, and one reason, among others, why the opera itself has never obtained its due share of popularity. Madame Rosa De Vries, who sus' tained the character on Saturday night, is an extremely clever vocalist, with a soprano voice of extensive range, considerable power, and good quality-a voice which is only damaged when, by forcing the higher notes, the singer en. dangersthejustness of herintonation. That MadameDeVries -a buxom HoZlandaise-is the sort of person, either by appearance or dramatic capability, to invest the part of Maria with the requisite halo of romance, it would be too much to say. The charm is not her's; and thus the credit plainly due to her skilful vocal execution has to be balanced against certain idiosyncrasies incompatible with a poetical realization. The beauty and impetuous energy of a Sophie Cruvelli, or of a Grisi in her prime, could alone stand a chance by the side of such a Chevreuse as Ronconi. Nevertheless, Madame De Vries sang in many respects like a genuine artist, and fully merited the applause she obtained. The part of Chalais was always disdained by " first tenors" until the admirable Tamberlik invested it with importance. Among the best representatives we have seen is Signor Neri Baraldi-a tenor almost new to the London stage, though well known in the provinces-who sang the music, and espe. cialy the rosrnana, " Quando il cor," with so much grace and sweetness, acting so naturally and with such intelligence, as to win unanimous approvaL We are inclined to believe that this gentleman has a "future" in store. He is young; and it depends upon himself to make the best use of the advantages with which nature has endowed him. One of the most legitimate successes of the evening was obtained by Madame Nantier Didiee, in the character of Armando di Gondi. It is agreeable to remark the steady progress of this artist, who came to London a short time since almost in the position of a recruit, and yet has already made her way to such a position that the contralto parts upon which the genius of Alboni waswont to confersuch lustrehave now seem-ingly found a new and competent representative. Both the opening air, "Per non ist are all'ozio," and the pretty Cavatina, in ActII-"Son leggero nell'amore"-were charmingly sung. The last made so great an impression upon the audience that it was unanimously encored. Thers was eprit, as well as vocal facility, in Madame Nantier Didie's singing; and both qualities were appreciated. The opera was efficiently mounted; and the band, under Mr. Costa, distinguished itself not merely for general excellence, b ut by its very fine performance of an overture which Donizetti evidently w rote con amore, although, like his other laboured prelude, to La Favorit<, it form s no exep - tion to the inability (shared with all his compatriots, Rossini alone excepted) invariably manifested in his attempts at elaborate orchestral composition. The renbr.?e of Mario is announced for Thursday, in the Trov orre.

MR. SCOTT BUSSBL'S GREAT STEAM- MHP. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIES. Sir,-Your interesting observations on the great ship now building in my yard at Millwall, in your leading aztice of this morning, have induced me to beg the favour of your communicating to the public some additional points of information, which I have no doubt they will find in. teresting I hope you will pardon me for saying that your mention of my name exclusively in connexion with that ship may be interpreted injuriously to the rights of others who have largely shared in whatever ments or responsibilities belong to the undertaking. In justice, therefore, to my own feelings and to their rights, I wish to communicate the following facts:- M[y share of the merit and responsibility is that of builder of the ship for the Eastern Steam Navigation Company. I des ignedher lines and constructed the iron hull of the ship, and am responsible for her merits or defects as a piece of naval architecture. I am equally responsible for the paddlewheel engines of 1,000 horse-power, by which she is to be propelled. But Messr James Watt and Co., the eminent engineer of Soho, have the entire merit of the design and construction of the engines of 1,500 horse-power which are to propel the screw. It is, however, to the company's engineer, Mr. L R. Brunel, that the original conCeption is due of building a steamship large enough to carry coals sufficient for ful steaming on the longest voyage. He, at the outset, and long before it had assumed a mercantile form, communicated his views to me, and I have participated in the contrivance of the best means to carry them into practical effect. I think, further, that the idea of using two sets of engines and two propellers is original, and was his invention. It was his idea also to introduce a cellular construction like that at the top and bottom of the Britannia-bridge into the construction of the great ship. It will be seen that these are the main characteristics which distinguish this from other ships, and these are Mr. Brunel's. Her lines and her structure in other reepects are identical with those of my other ships, which are constructed like this on a prin ciple of my own, which I have systematically carried out during the last 20 years, and which is commonly called the "wave" principle. In other respects, also, her materials are jut together in the manner usual in my other ships. Ith ink, teo, there are others whose names and services in ;his matter the public should not forget whenever the great ship is mentioned. The mercantile difficulty appeared at the outset, and this has proved itself sincoe, to be quite as great as the mechanical difficulty of the undertaking. So unusual an enterprise could not have been carried out without ability, enterprise, and pradence, to the credit of which the board of directors, represented by their chairman, Mr. H. T. Hope, and their secretary, Mr. John Yates, are entitled in a high degree. And there was one of them who bore the burden and heat of the day, and at the outset of this undertaking was one of its most able and zealous supporters, the late Mr. Charles Geach. I think I am just-fied in saying that without him it would never, as a mercantile speculatioD, have been undertaken by many of those who have undertaken it; that on his aid and exertions many of us probably, and certainly myself, relied mainly for the successful issue of the undertaking, and that his untimely deatn materially increased the difficulties of that undertaking, both to the directors and to the constructor of the ship. Let not, therefore, his share of any merit that may belong to the undertaking be forgotten. In conclusion, permit me to add that my share of the merit and responsibilty ends with the construction of the hull and of the paddlewheel engines, which have now been nearly completed by my assistants, Mr. Dickson and &fr. flepworth. The launching of the ship, the rigging and masting of the ship, her cabins and her outit are not mine, but are executed entirely under Mr. Brunel, Captain Harrison, and the other offlcers of the company. I have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant J. SCOTT RUSSELf .1, 'ireat *eDoree-street, Westminster April 18.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIME&S Sir,- I sent you a week ago some remarks in answer to " Young America's " charges of misstatements and igno. rance on my part, which, however, you did not insertdoubtless for sufficient reason. But as in The Times of the 16th your correspondent agsin speaks of my erroneous scatementpehaps you will alow me to restate what I did say. You will remember that my remarks were in answer to a question raised in your leading article, whether the new American frigates could by their superior speed keep out of range of our screw line-of-battle ships, and hammer at them witn their enormous guns. In answer to this I said that the ierrniac, I believed, had a speed of no more than seven knots under steam alone, and that, being armed with guns throwing hollow shot and shell only, I doubted whether the range of those guns was equal to that of the 95 owt. 68 pounders with which our screw line-of-battle ships are armed. I certainly said that the Merrimac's guns were for hollow shot and shell only. Now, where are my misstatements? Not in saying the Merrimac has a speed of only seven knots, for " Young America" confirms it, and does not weaken the force of that fact by the reasons he gives for it, viz.-that her engines are only auxiliary ones, for our screw liners have only the same. Does " Young America" caU it ignorance or misstatement that I doubt the range of holow shot equaUing that of solid shot? An tiro in gunnery would easily tell him where the ignorance lies. He says, however, that the guns of the Merrimac will carry solid shot. This certainly may be so, but not only is it generaUy (I beheve always) the case that 10-inch guns for hollow shot cannot carry solid shot, but I have now before me the description of the Dahlgren guns in the Merrinmac, which states :-"The Merrimac is interesting in any particular, being exclusively armed with guns adapted for throwing sheus and hoilow shot, but not solid projectiles. Sbe is armed exclusively with shell guns, and there is not one solid shot on board." I said that our Agamemnon had attained a speed of 11 knots, and the French Napoleon a speed of 14. I repeat this statemnent. Let me assure " Young Amnerica" that I have no wish to disparage the new American frigates. I instanced the Merrimac as being the largest and most heavily armed frigate that any nation has produced, and yet that even she could not do what you suggested in your leading article. I did not say anything about the Niagara, because I know nothing about her* but " Young America" speaks of her as being comparativefy lightly armed, which removes her from tbe class in question. I leave " S. C." to settle tho question with " Young America" whether the Merrimac could carry 60 of such guns as she has-a question I did not raise. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. P. apru 1.
'.aE BOILAR EXPLOSION AT LEEBROOx.-On Friday evening the inquest on the two women, Bridget Fox and Julia Flynn, who were killed by the exDlosion of a boiler at the works of Messrs. Bagnall and Sons, at Leebrook, near Wednesbury, as briefly noticed in last Teesday's 2imes, was concluded before Mr. Hinch!iffe, one of the coroners for the county of Stafford. The evidence went to show that the deceased were employed in washing " gleed," a species of cinder, at the works, when the boiler burst and they were killed by the flying d6bris. It appeared that the boiler which burst was one of three of very large size used on the premises, and that it had been placed in its position about three years ago. It was repaired a month ago, but one of the enginemen had'reported to the manager of the works, David Hill, that this particular boiler leaked. The engines were suppowed to be at work at 191b. or 201b. to the square inch, and Mr. Cartwright, one of the engineers, gave his opinion that it would be safe to work the boiler at a pressure of 501b. to the inch. A strict examination of the toiler has been made since the explosion by a practical engineer, who reported that it had been made of inferior marerl. 1he jury, after hearing a number of witnesses, returned a verdict to the effect, " That the deceased met their deaths by the explosion of a boiler, which was solely caused by the infencrity of the material, and that when the leakage was reported to the man.ger he should have taken steps to ascertain the cause." REBEL,ION iN UTAI.-We talk of the necessity for a first-class (,Governor in Kansas; hut the news from Utah shows pretty plainly that, unless we have some one there who can cat Gordian knots, we shall have more trouble than, the present generation will outlive. It seems from onrinformation, published at length elsewhere, tbat inJanuarylast a party of Mormons, of high standing in the church, under the advice of Brigham Young, broke into the offices of the 'United States' District Judge, and Clerk of the Stpreme Court, and carried away by force all the papers and books belonging to the Supreme Court. The reason they gave for this outrage was, that Congress would not admit them as a State, and that they did not intend to tolerate any United States' offices in the territory. These Mormons have, we tbink, reached the term of our patience; it is time they were brought to their senses. It is time it was decided 'whether they awe an indeenudent community or really a territory of the United States. For years they have been exciting the feelings of the American people; it is nowhigh time that some settlement were had with them, and tbat the pending issues between us were adjusted on some pernianent basis. We have no desire to prejudge the qiseAtion, or to attempt from this distance to say what ought to be done in the territory of Utah; but one thing is ob. iously required,-one of the very best men in the country hbould be sent to Salt L,ake City, with a sufficient force of nited States' troops to enforce reSpect; and an end sahould' bepu$ once and, for ever, by fair means or foul, to the-series of oqc,sges of which this violationI of the records of the Snpr¢me CQtirt at Utal4 is the lst-. .-Nw .H rk^,
