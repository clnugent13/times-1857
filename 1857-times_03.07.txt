The CHArix. said*it was not his intention to make any lengthened observations, as he considered le h fuiled his duty by having, as President of that Association, called its membes togetber that they might have an opportunity of expresing an opinion on the present state of public affs, especially as connected with our officidl relations in a foredgn country. This was no political meeting; they knew nothing opolitics in that room. (Cheers.) e was
ld to see arount him men-so Far as he at all knew their opnios-of almost every Ihad of politics, and be Was
&a to see on this occasion auch an assemblage of merchants, manufacturers, and large traders as was eldom seen in the city of Manhebter. It was a sign, at all events, that they had been ready to rcspond to the invitation of the directors to say that they were not indifferent to the question at issue. (Hear, hear.) Thc hon. mnember for the city of Mnchester nad taken upon himself to observe, iS. the course of his speech in the Honue of Commons the other day, that he hid receired no intimation of any particular interest felt in this question at Mancester, except that a memorial had been sent him from a public mecting in that city, on the subject. Now, what was that public meeting? As he r. Tner)understood, it was a gatering of friends of Mr. urquhart, and of persons among whose names not half-a-dozen could be found that were at all known as ocCDpying a position in that city. (Hear, hear.) He sawa very different assembly before him to-day, for here, as he had aready said, was most influer.tial body ofgentlemen. And, although it had been imputed to them by another hon. member of the Houee of Commons that they were a set of selfish merchants-in fact, he believed the imputation had been aplied to British merchants generally, that they were a set of gelsh invividuals, who were -atterly regardless of all conse nences, provided they served their own interests-he denies that assertion altogether. The gentlemen whom he saw before him were not a set of selfish merchants, but a set of indignant men, who had seen, to use Lord Palmerston's expression, "a fortuitons concourse of atoms,7 gathered together in one lobby, ctuated by very questionable motives. Whatever they might say, he believed the parties to that combination had gained very little credit, and did not much like the position in which they had placed themselves. Heregardedthis vote as a diuster, because be wras satisfied that, as soon as it was known that the House of Commons did not support the Government on the measures of their officials the efrect would be most injuriors throughout the East. Whether those measures were right or wrong he did not now inquire. since it was the duty of our ;overnment at aU events to support their subordinates abroad, or these last would not have Courage to fulfil their dutv. (Hear.) This meeting was, therefore, not assembled in support of any particular Government, but in support of our mercantile position in all parts of the world, on which he was Fatisfied a very bad effect had been produced by the recent vote. He knew not how the injury was to be repaired; but, at all events, let that association do all they could to show the Government that the7 wished our servants abroad to be supported in maintaining the firm and honourable position of this country wherever we had representatives. (Cheers.)
3Ir. W. BL WOOD moved the first resolution. Re observed that, while this was not a meeting for any political purpose, neither was it a meeting to try the conduct of Sir .J.Toriwng or Admiral Seymour. He believed the conduct of such matters was best left in the bands of the executive Government. He did not therefore propose to follow the example of another assembly, which bad unfortunately pronounced on the conduct of Sir J. Bowring. He had confidence, and until the last few days should have said the country had the firmest confdence, in the charcter and judgment of Lord Palmerston and Lord Clarendon, relying thal they would send out no instruetions which were at variance with the interests and honour of England, or with wbat was due to the interests of justice and humanity. (Hear, bear.) He believed tho hon. member for the West - Riding of Yorkshire had in this matter been perfectly consistent. He believed there was no doubt of the hon. gentleman having declared, on a former occasion, that from his earliest years he vas most earnestly attached to what might be called tho principles of peace, and that those measures in connexion with whicb his name vould be handed down with glory to posterity had been to him matters of very secondary importance. Cer. tainly, he (Mr. Wood) did not attribute to the hon. gentlemnnfor one moment any desire, by the success of his motion, to take a place on the Treasury benches; but in this respect he could not say quite so much for some of Mr. Cobdens alles. He could not help recaUing the fact that during a great part of his (Mr. Wood's) political life the great Conservative party of tbis country had been led by a man from whom it was often his fate, at a humble distanc, to differ in opinion, but who, as all wbo knoew him, must feel, bad ever at heart the honour and glory and interest of England; and if Sir Robert Peel had now been the leader of the Opposition in the British House of Commons be ventured to express his belief that this voto would not have been arrived at. (Hear, hear.) But when the members of that awociation considered the conduct of others in that Hous it was their duty in some degree perhaps to look at home. He had heard: with surprise the observations, quoted by the chairman, of the nght hon. member for Manchester, which would not hxre been creditable even in a representative of the smallest and leastimportant constituencyin England, and he shoul4have thought, if there had been in the Housoeof Commons a man who had any knowledge of the feelings of Mfanchester, or one to whom its reputation was dear, he would have rise-n at once to contradict that statement. The debate would be read with Lio deepest interest in all parts of the world, andit would go forth in the reports that Manchester, by the voice of its representative, had declared that opinion. He was bound to believe that what the right hon. gentle man had said he believed to be true, but the only conclusion at which he could arrive was that some persons had beentrying "to make a fool" of the right hon. entleman, and they had succeeded in so doing. Hear, ear," and laughter.) He (Mr. Wood) could tr say that, during what he could call his political life, extending over about 30 years, he never remembered a vote wbich appeared to him so calamitous as this one. (Rear, hear.) He had always, felt and believed that, in those great commercial transactions which England carried en throngh all parts of the world, English property and English life were safe under the protection of the English Government! under the respect due to and maintained by the British eoSe, and under the homage invariably enforced or the ritish flag. Would that be the case hereafter? (Hear, hear.) He had read two days ago some very interestingaccountsof agrcss outrage which had taken place in Mexico. An armed force, under the orders of the revolutionary Government, attacked the British Consulate} demanding surrender of a large amount of property belonging to a British merchant wer known in mManchcster. He believed there was 10,0001. of treasure at stake, and the consul acted as the reyresentatire of England ought to do. He hoisted the flag of the Consulate, and refused to Surrender the property until the armed force broke open his doors. That man did his duty, and for doing it perhaps he would find that he had been denounocd in the British House of Commons as Stroublesome Zad meddlesome oflicial. (Applause.) That association was not formed for any political purpose. The first words of its code of laws de-
lared it to be an as30ciation for the promotion and protection of the trading interests of its membors, and on that ground as wall as-if he might be allowed to say so-on far higher grounds, he asked the mneeting to
ass the resolution which he had now the honour to sub"That this association, composed of merchants and manufacturers deeply interested in trade and commerce with all quarters of the world, views with profound regret the probable consequetces of the division on Mr. Cobden's motion in the House of Commons on the 3d inst.

Active measures are being taken to secure the return of the present members (M essrs. H. Berkeley and IL G. Langton). L The Opposition party here, which is of the same beterogeneous character as the recent majority, are neither united in action nor ntimerijallyr strong, and will have some difficulty inx selecting a candidate whose political professions would be sufraciently ehamaeleon-like to secure any large amiount of nufrages from the Opposition electors.

FITZOEBALD, from grocers and teadealers in Horaham, against the scale of tea duties proposed by the Government.
THE BURIAL ACTS.
Sir De L. EVANS asked if it was the intention of Government to introduce a Bill to amend the Burial Acts; and, if so, whether there would be any objection on the part of the Government that a clause similar to clause 8 of the Burial Act for Ireland, passed in the year 1853, be introduced therein, securing certain sacred rights to bury in fatnily faults in existing cemeteries.
Mr. MASSEY said that his attention had been directed to the subject, and should he, in the next Parliament, hold the office which he now held he should submit a Bill on the subject, but he could not state what its provisions woould be.
WEST LONDON UNION.
Lord C. HAMILTON asked the President of the Poor Law Board whether the deficient accommodation for the caumal poor in the West London Union had been offlcially brought under his notice. The humane conduct of the Lord Mayor had brought to light the deficiency of the accommodation.
Mr. BOUVERIE said that on seeing the report in the public journals on this subject he found upon inquiry that the West London Union had, near the King's-cross station of the Great Northern Railway, a place for the reception of casual paupers during the night, when there was no room for them in the workhouse. That place was, in fact, a stable, which afforded the merest shelter in the world. There was a division in it whereby the male casual paupers were separated from the female. Only a few rags were supplied to cover them. The inspector of the district had only recently been appointed, and was not aware of the existence of this very indifferent place of shelter untUI he bad vited it by his (Mr. Bouverie's) directions. The in. spector took the earliest possible opportunity of seeing the guardians on the subject, and made several recommenda. tions to them, with the view of improving the place. The guardians were quite wiUing to accede to his recommendations, and he believed that they were taking steps to provide a more decent place of refuge for easual poor.
ALI MOORAD KIAN.
Sir F. KELLY asked tho President of the Board of Control whether in the case of the petition presented to Her Majesty the Queen by his Highness Ameer All Moorad Rhan on the 13th day of November last, and by Her Majesty referred to the Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of India, any decision had been come to bv the board; and, if so, on what ground the communication of that decision was withheld from the petitioner, who was now in London awaiting such decision.
Mr. V. SMITH said that such petitions were referred to the Government of India, in order that they might be investigated by the local authorities. That course was not pur. sued in the first instance in this case, and it had there. fore been remitted to the Governor-General of India. He had been informed that AUi Moorad Khan had left England, and that -was the reason why no communication was sent to him. Ho was, however, told on Monday last that such was not the case, and he therefore at once forwarded a com. munication to him on the subject of the petition.
In answer to Sir F. KxLLy,
Mr. V. SMITH added that the decision of the Board of Control had been transmitted, together with the petition, to the Governor-General of India.
OUDE. In answer to Mr. OTwAy,
Mr. V. SMITH said that he had not yet perused the despatehes with regard to the State of Oude, and was not, ther*fore, able to furnish a list of the creditors' claims upon it. He had, however, no objection to lay upon the ta')le anyF papers which might throw light upon the subject.
LIGHT DUES.
Mr. J. EWART asked the Vice-President of the Board of Trade whether it was intended to make any, and what, further reduction in the light dues levied by the three ge. neral lighthouse boards, under the Merchant Shipping Act,
Mr. LOWE said that in 1854 the light dues for England, Scptland, and Ireland were consolidated into one fund and placed under the management of the Beard of Trade. The mm-ediate result of that consolidation was a reduction of these dues to tha extent of 100,000. a-year. Since the oon. solidation the Board of Trade had undertaken the construction and had nearly completed 21 lighthouses out of the lih dues fund,, and was about to construct a'cout-13 more.

Mr. V. SMITH thought tbatl&hon. friend would admit tepropnety of witliolding these papers unil the treaty bad wea ratified. (" Oh 1") There was no intention on the part of Her Majesty's Government to lay them on the table at present, and, indeed, their production at present coald not be of much service, as a dissolLtion of Parliament impended. Ws hon. friend would have an opportunity of bringing the matter forward in the next Parliament, in whicn he hojed that he should have the pleasure of meeting thehon.gentlemananddiscussingit withhim.

BRIBERY AT ELECTIONS.
Sir F. KELLY wished to know what the intentions of the Government were with regard to the Corrupt Practices at Elections Act, whLh wouldexpire before the next general election. (Eear, hear)
Sir G. GREY thought that that Act was to continue in force till Aunust, 1857, and until the end of the then next session of Parliament.
Mr. G. BUTT.-That Is so.
Sir F. KELLY.-Is it, then, the intention of the Government to leave the law as it is ?
Sir G. GREY said a committee had been appointed to inquire into the operation of the Act in question - but it was quite impossible that that inquiry could be unily gone into, and any important alterations in the Act bepassedinto law before the end of the present Parliament. Under these circumstances the Government would not take any step in the matter until the assembling of the next Parliament,
ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE.
AMERICA.
On the motion that the House at its rising should adjourn until Monday,
M.r. GORDON said,-Not seeing the noble lord at the head of the Government in his place, I shall postpone the question as to our relations with America, of whioh I gave notice, until this day week.
PERSIA.
Mr. LAYARD hoped that the House 'would pennit him to make a few remarks on Persia, as the answer of the President of the Board of Control to his queston was not satisfactory. The Persian war was instituted when Parliament was not sitting, and had been concluded during its sitting, but without its knowledge. No information whatever had yet been given to the House as to the expenditure occasioned by that war, nor as to how it originated, nor as to the negotiations which had brought it to a conclusion. Under these circumatances he thonght that the House ought to renuire the Government to produce all the papers on the subject. Before they were sent back to their constituents the country should have the means of judging of the policy of that war, which he believed was unjust in its origin, impolitic as to the mode in which it had been concluded, and likely to lead to disastrous results in Central Asia. He did not like to throw any difficulty in the way of Her Majesty's Government, but at the same time he thought that the House and the country were placed in a very awkward and unfair position with regard to this Persian war. When they were called upon to pronounce a judgment on the policy of Her Majesty's Government it was essential for them to know what the history of the Persian war was. He hoped that some one who had greater authority in that House than himself would insist on the production of the papers on that subject, or at least a selection of them, in order that the House might have some fair means of judging how the wrar commenced, howr it ended, and what was the character of the treaty into wvhich this country was about to enter with Persia.
Mr. V. SMITH could only repeat his former answer, that he hoped there would be no discussion upon this subject until the treaty had been ratified. It was perfectly obvious that any discussion in that House must lead to the expression of opinions which might be unpalatable to the Persian Government, and might lead to dissensions at that Court which would prevent the ratification of the treaty. His hon. friend had stated that both war and peace had been made while Parliament was sitting. War was not made while Parliament was sitting, because, as he had stated before, it was not until the 26th of September,which they all knew was during the recess. That peace had been made was he supposed, a cause of congratulation both to Parhament and to the country. (Hear.) No vote of money would be asked for until after the meeting of the new Parliament. By that time he hoped that the treaty would have been ratified, and that the papers might be laid uyon the table. In the meantime he hoded that his hon. friend would exercise the same discretion which had hitherto guided his proceedings, and that other hon. gentlemen would follow the same line, and not force upon the Government a discussion which might be prejudicial to the interests of the country.
Sir H. WILLOIUGHBY did not wish to enter into the question of the Persian war, but he thought that it was a very bad system to refer a matter of so much importance to the Indian authorities, instead of it being declared and conducted like other wars by the Home Govern ment.
Mr. GLADSTONE was not aware that this question was to be raised, but he thought that having been raised it ought not to be disposed of without a moment's consideration. He did not intend to express any decided opinion, but he must frankly confess that he was not satisfied with what bad fallen from the righthon. gentleman the President of the Board of ControL Let them obrerve what the upshot of this would be. War was made without the consent of Parliament. WhenParliament met negotiations were commenced, and they were pleaded as a reason why no inquiry should be made into the cause of the war. When they asked for an estimate of the expense they were told that it could not be presented, because it would interfere with the negotrations. The warhad now been terminated, but still, if he understood rightly it was not intended to present that estimate to the present l'arliament, so that, inpointof fact, the representatives of the people would have no opportunity of passing judgment either upon the war or upon the conduct of Government in regard to it until the new Parliament met, when the war would have been closed for three or four months. Then, and then only, would they be called upon to pay the bilL If that were to be the state of thigs it was ridiculous to talkof free and representative government in Enzland, at least so far as concerned the question of the Persian war. He did not wish to go beyond this point at the present moment, but he thought that it deserved more consideration than it could receive in the course of a conversation arising in this manner.
Mr. WHITESIDE wished to remind the House of the answer which the right hon. gentleman the President of the Board of Control gave him on a former occasion when he ventured to think that the policy which was pursued by this Government with reference to Kars might lead to a certain events, which had taken place. The right hon. gentleman then said that he had taken counsel of the wisest men not members of Her Majesty's Government, and they had assured him that there was not the slightest chance of any disturbance inPlersia;leastof alwasthere a prospect of any movement upon Herat. It would be interesting to ascertai
what was the cause of this war, because, if it were that which it had been understood to be, it was very desirable that the House should have an opportunity of expressing its opinion upon it before the noble lord at the head of the Government made his appeal to the country. (Hear.)
THE RESOLUTE.
Mr. EVELYN rose, pursuant to notice, to call the attention of the House to the conduct of the Admiralty in reference to the Arctic vessel the Resolute, He had no wish to recommend any more Arctic expeditions, because he thought that quite as much had already been done in that way as was required by the honour of the country. Neither did he intend to impute to the Admiralty any intentional disrespect towards the American Government; but he thought that in their mode of dealing with the Resolute they had committed a great blunder, which mightbe a cause of irritation in America, and might there be construed, however erroneously, into an evidence of want of respect towards that country. The first part of the proceedings with regard to this vessel was extremelv honourable to the Lords of the Admiralty, and quite worthy of persons who were in their position. The hon. member briefly sketched the history of the Resolute, including her abandonment in 1854, her discovery and rescue from the ice by the captain of an American whalng ship, and her purchase and refitment at the expense of the American Government for presentation to the Queen of England. There were two things which gave a peculiar significance to this gift,-one that we had recently been eDgaged in an angry controversy with the Americans * and the other that, owing to the democratic institutions of America, when Congress voted 40,000 dollars for the purchase and refitment of this ship, it was its own money, and not that of others which it voted. On the 12th of December the Resolute arrived at Spithead under the command of Captain Hartstein, and on the 16th of that month Her Majesty went on board and received the vessel as a gift from the hands of that officer. Up to this point the conduct of our Government was perfectly satisfactory, hut in what had happoned since the admiralty had committed a blunder. Within six short weeks after Her Majesty's visit to the vessel it was stripped dismantled,. and laid up in ordinary in Chatham dockyard, -a proceeding which could hardly be regarded as very comnplimentary to tbe American Government. He had persn-,
aly Inspected the vessel at Chatham yesterday, and found
her in a miserably neglected condition, which could not be viewed without extreme pain by anybody who saw her at Spithead. o knew not what further degradation might be reserved for her, hut he understood that she was about to receive the dockyard brand, in which case every vestie of her individuality would be lost, so that Captain Hartatein himself, who brought her from the United States to this country, could not tell her from the other hulks that lay near her. He (Er. Evelyn) knew it might be said
that the usual routine bad been followed in regard to the Resolute; but that was his very complaint, insmuch as, her case being an entirely exceDtional one, she ought not to have been dealt with according to the ordinary rule. She should have been kept for at least one year in the same state as she was when presented by the Americans to our Queen before being stripped and dismantled. The answer given on this smbiect the other dav by the First Lord of the Admiralty was anything but satisfactory. The ques-
tion put to the ri4ht hon. gentleman had no reference whatever to the provisions on board of the vessel, and yet he had confined his reply to the state of a qusatity of rum that had been left in her. He hoped the right hon. gentleman sculd have no objecthon o say what was proposed to be done with the Resolute.
Sir C. WOOD said that the hon. gentle nan had sketched very corretly the history of the Resolate from the date when she frst went out; to the Arctic Seas until she returned to this country as a present from the American G4overnment. He had done Her Majesty's Government no zmore that justice in acknowledging that in all their cotnmunications on this subject tith the merican Goverinmeit they had endeavoured to meet the generous conduct of the latte!r in a cortespondi6g spirit. l Every poesible attention had been sh wio to the offlcers who brought over the vessel, -MndHer Mmajest was graciuly pleas6l. to pay Captain

Next, inasmuch as you have a deficiency in the revenue for the present year, you must also impose 2 000,000! of additional taation to cover it. fy right hon friend's finncil scheme leads to this consequencem that Tou Must raise %000,003t. this year of unneoessarY taxtion, in order to store over 2,OD,OOOT. with which to redeem Excbequer-bonds next year. That, as far as I cn comrprehend it, is the practical renlt of his plan. If itean be attined n ar.y otheray I confes lanm totaUy unable to discover it (Hresr, ber.) If he means that we are to eontinue the war inoome-tax to the full extent of 16;0,w3,000L, then, no doubt that would very anuch fAclitate the redemption of the debt in the rAext year, because tbere wouad be a sarplus of 4Q ,000,D

Idon't know wbether that is my rght heo, frend' plan, hut the result of it would be that we shoul have a srplus for this year for which we have no application andalso-f hewes i high income-tax for next year to redeem the debt. Instea of doing this by the cluasy anode of levingtoolargeatx this year to obtain a sarplus, let him propose an additional charge to the income-tax for next year, which would give him wbat he wants when the exigency*riss without pacin unneDesry burdens an the country this year My right hon. friend stated that I misnnderstood or mitook what e said respecting the consumption of tea and sugar. We, now, he read a return of conmumption extending over 11 months I have the statement before me for 12 months, and let the House obserre the progress made in the consunmption of tea, and how far the duty I proposd has had the effect of limiting and checking the oonsumption of tea. These figures, which I will read, are those upon which my right hon. frendfonanded his rery impsioned and pathetic complaint, thatwe were grinding and crushing thepoorwith impoets on necessies neard of in the anals of taxation I WMpo back as fas s 1835 to sow theprogr of eon sumption. The quntities I ill reed are those retained for home COnsumption. In 13the quan -wtywas36,574,0001b. in 1845, 44,193,07b.; in 1852, ism713001b.; in 1853 o8K&34,000lb. That w the year before the war, ad it wi serve for a point of connparison. In 185 the eo sUmption rose to 61,953,00&b. II the years of high war duties the consumption was as followsas -Iu 1855, 63,429,000b. i in 1856, 63,277,0001b Tese two last years ware thus yers of the highest consumption of tea ever known in thiscountry, and under this "grindine and crushing tax, which is now Is. 9d. 5Ear, hear.) And whaLt I propose is to reduce this tax stll further to the "grindig and crns"lam duty of Is. 5. per lb. (Hear,
enow t e article of sugar. In 1835 the quantity of sonz tatlcon out of consumption, refined aLnd unreSned jointly, was 4,022,850 cwt.; in 1845, 4,856,680 cwt. There was afterwards a great change made, and in 1852 the consumption was 7,172,858 cwt., which in 15>3 rose to 7,487,5S9 ewt. My right hon. friend says that I mistook the figures, and that I was wrong in saying that the consmption of sugr
as not materially affected bv tho war. Now, in 1853 the consunption was 7,487z00 cwt, which in 1851 rose to 8,3&3,407 cwt. In 1855 the qantity certinly fell to 7,547 17 cwt., and in 1856 it was 7,361,371 cwt Thus although in the last two yeas the comnmption WaS les; than in 1854, yet in 1855it was greaater than i 1853 and in 1856 it was nearly equal It is therefore obvious that tho consumption ofsugar has not been mnaterially affectd by te war duties. Theoonsumption of molasses has graduall increased from 844.030 cwt. in 1853 to i92,266 cwt in 1854 920,940 cwt.in 1855, and938,776cwtin 1856. (Eear.) Therefore, with regard to molasses the consumption of lst year was greater than thatof any previousyear. IF,on the other hand, I take the article of malt, I find that the consumption of malt in 1852 was 41,071,636 bushels; in 1853, 41,82,178 bushels; in 1854, 36,812,727 bushels; in 1855, 33,879 3S bushels; in 1856, 36,970,427 bushels, So that a more ecided effect was produce4 by the war duties
npon malt than upon either of the articles of tea or sugar. (Hear, bear.) I will only mention the oppon of hfr. nrCulloch, whose authority mnst have considerable weight
aponn question of this nature, and -who is acquainted with all the statistius of taxation in this conntry. In his Coin 7nerc-ia Dictionary he said :-" When not carried to an extravagant height, duties on sugar afford, in truth, one of Ihe least exceptionable means by which alarge revenue mar be most convenientlyraised" :sir, the additional revenuel
ropose to rai on the articles of tea and sugar is not very large. It wllnot, I think, amount to 1,004D,uLi in the present year. It is, nevertheless, a part of the financial ,lan of the year, aod, although I Iament as much as ny right hon. frien himself, or as an, hon neiner can do, the necessity that exists for imposmg duties upon articles that are extensively consumed, not only by the upper and middle classes, but also by the worlengc
wish that it vwere in my power conscentiously to accede to the mnotion of the right hon. ent1eman, and allow the decline of duties to take place withont impediment, yet stDi I believe that if we are driren to find an alternative, and if the House,rejectingthis proposition thepartof the Government, should substitute some other taxon some ot her article of general consumption, it will be found that that substitute will not bo lees onerous or more acceptable to the bulk of the people than that which I now propose. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. SPOONEB said it had been stated that in a coversation which took place lastJanuary botween the Chancellor of the Exchequer andsome gentlemen who formed pert of a de. putationto him, tho rightnon. gentlemanstatedto somegreat teadealers-who were present that the duty upon tea would drop by law on the 5th of April. If that were an unquallfie answer those gentlemen might haveacted upon it, and, if so, teproposenow anewscalo of duties was adirect breach of faith. He confessed his view was rather in farour of the Government resolutions, but upon the right hon. gentleman's answer to this question would depend his vote.
The CHANCELLOR of the EX2CHEQTER.-I am much obliged to my hon. friend for giving me an opnortu. nity of auswerng his question. Iean of course hardly be expected, at this distanoe of time, to recall the exact words that fell from me on the occasion. At the time to which he refers I had the honour of receiving a deputation of gentlemen, who came to ress me to inform them whether it was the intention of the erument to adhere to the whole amount of income-tax for the ensuing year, and whether the Government viewed those words in the income-tax which have been so often referred to as constituting a sort of bond between them and the House of Commons, of which the Government were entitled to avail themselves, whether the service of the year required it or not. In answer to that question I stated what was the law with respect to the differnt duties that were Imposed during tho War, and I said that tho war duty on malt had expired on the 5th of July; that by law the tea and sugar duties expired on the 1st of April next I explained the law with regard to the income-tax, and proceeded to give them an answer to the question witii respect to the intentions of the Government, telling them that it was nottheintention of the Government to take advantage of a technical expression in the Actof PArliament. I have no doubt that this is subgtanItidlly what I said, butImarelystated a matter of fact. The
deputation did not aska question about tce or sugar. It was
a deputation, if I remember aright, from the Society for the I Reduction of the Income-tax (hear, bear), and they came to mecexclusively on that question They not only did not represent the teadealers, but they put to me no question on the subject of the tea duties. I introduced it upon my owin
tought and suiggestion,and did not lead them to expect that those duties wrould be increased or diminished, or dealt wvith in any maimer wavhtever. (iHear, hear.)
Lord J. RUSSELL-H%ving given notice of an amend. ment to tie duties proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, it is due to the committee that I should tate the course that I propose to take. But before I do so, as a renewed discussion has been raised, first by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and then by my right hon. friend the member for the University of Oxford, with regard to the merits of the budpet, I must in a few wvords resate my opuinon. My right bon. friend says that I objectod very much to the propositions that he stated, und no doubt it is my habit, w'hen I have formed my opinion after some labour and deliberation, to state my opinion as trongly sa I ctn, not, I hope it is unnecesary to say, from any wish to impoee my opinion upon the House, but In order to make the Hoaue perfoctly understand the reasons on which I have acted. It appears to me on considering the budget that tho ChanceDor of the Exchequer has proved that it was a very fair and honest sttement of the requirements of tho year, and the manier in which he proposed to meet them. (Hear, hear.) It appears to me that, as the ratification of a troaty of peace does nbt carry'witl it immediately an end of the expenses of war, it is necessary for tho Chanoelor of the Exchequer to contider inwhat manner those expenses shall be met. The present Chancellor of the Exchequer, in onformity both
with the principle and the policy which were estabishd
durint the war, propoed that thoes expenses sholda bo met partly by ane iome-tx caried beyond the amount which the iaw3 a down, and partlyby dutieson tea and sugar, also beyond the amount which the law imposed. It seems hardly worth while to considerwhctherts isroduction or augmen. tatiou. The qustion is -wrhether it is a fair quota in the present state of ie insnoes of the country. I do not thiuk
it lword be right for the ffouas to say, " We will leave on a considerable portion of the war income-tax, but we will take away entirely the duties on tea and on sugar." At the sasne time Ithirk it would be Llso wog to carry ferther the reduction of the income-tax and leave a groter tax on tea and sugar than the Chancellor of the Excbequer
proposed. It appeArs to me that, as property bas borne a lage propotion of tho expenses of the war, it is fit that, if furtlher sarifices nare nec , the com munity at large should contribute. I cannnt see that the extreme Prlia-
inmentay m ormer wll obtain the grat advantage of beinr able to say, " Look at the unfairness of taxation. Tho rich are zelie-ing themelves, but the comforts of the poor aro
taxed." It maitht be xo if the income-tax were altogether abolshed; but I tailk that the qoor, 'with the sound snse and reason which they po eess, wll see tbat, to tax equally and fairly, rArliament must tax, according to their eansxn and expenditure, the r as well s the ich

also saw him. When CQptaii Htartstein left Englaad he was pleased,to express hiinelf very wkrmly on the cordial reception given to him aud his brother olficers by thLe
luthorities of this country; and, although our Government offered to convey them back to the United States in an Eagisa frigate, and the offer was at first accepted, they subsequently thought proper to decline it. So handsome e gift from the American Government to our Queen Victoria, and given, too, in 0o liberal and honourable a spirit by the donors, would, it was thought, be the means of cementing the good understanding between the two nations; and be really did not believe that Her Majests Govemnment had been in any way deficient in their courtesy towards the American overmment. If it had ever croseed his mind that what was done to the vessel could be construed into a want of respect towards the American Government, he should oert have been the last person to sanction it. What tbey had done, however, was to put the sahip in the state moet conducive to herpreservation. It waswellimnown that nothing was so prejudicial to a vessel as to keep her fittings and her stores on hoard when she wus not on service; and it was the invariable practice of our navy to remove tbe fittings and stores of our most valuable ships when out of commission. If, therefore, the Admiralty had done wrong, their sole object had been to do w'hat ihey deemed calculated to preserve as long as possible this most gratifying memento of the friendship audgood-will of ourTransatlantic kinsmen. (Hear.) He wasorry that the hon. gentleman should have been displeased at what he stated about the provisions of the Rlesolute the other day. He had simply
mentioned, as a curious fact that the House would perhaps
like to hear, that a portion of the Resolute's store of rum, which had been out so many winter. in the Arctic Ses, had come home again in a most improved condition. (A. laugh .)
SUPPLY OF GUANO.
lr. P. SCOTT wished to call attention to the necessity of taking measures to obtain guano from the Arabian slands on terms more moderate than those lately concluded by the Government, provided protection be afforded to those engaged in its exportation, and to secure its importation from those islands to this country. Sinoe the introduction of guano into this country there never was a period when the imports of that article had fallen off to such an extent as they did last year. This arose, not from any decrease in the exportations from Peru, but from the monopoly of the merchants, who had the whole of the PerLvian guano trade in their own hands, and kept the stock low in order to obtaia high prices. Large quantities were shipped to the West Indies, the Maurtius, nd other distant places, instead of being brought to the market of this country. It therefore behoved the Government to adopt measures calculated to check a monopoly which limited our suppl of so necessary and important an article of commerce. toe sources from which guano were obtained were few in numberviz., first, the plains of Thibet; next, the coast of South America; and third, the coast of Arabia. In 1853 Mr. Ord had discovered theexiestenceofdepositsof guano to the extent of between one and two millions of tons, the value ofwhichwouldbefroralO,OOO,0Ol.tol5,ODO.OOZ., oncertainislandsoffthecoastofArabia. Theseislandsbad been ceded to the Britsh Crown by the Imaum of Muscat, and the Government, with singular improvidence and neglectof the interests of British agriculture, immediately crested another g.nmo monopoly in favour of Mr. Ord and several other individuals. The royalty of 2s. a-ton for the fDrst year and 4s. in the following years was exacted, but there was no stipulation made that the guano brought thence to this country should be sold in open auction here, as ought to have been the case. Every ton of it might be reahipped to foreign countries without coming into the market. Mr. Ord Ead been prevented from removing any guano by the Arabs actingmn connexion with some United States' merchants, who werenow busily employed inremovingthe guano to the main land. Under these circumstances, of course, Mr. Ord had to resort to the protection of the Government. He had been informed that a bargain had been made between Mr. Ord and other parties to allow them to remove the guano on paying him L1. for every ton imported. That sum, he thought, should be Himited to a given number of hundreds of thousands of tons first imported, and should then decrease in a certain ratio, and steps ought to be tak-en to insure the sale of the guano inthis country. There was another question connected with this subject which was too important to be raised in a desultory conversation-the power of the Emigration Commissioners to create this monopoly. The responsibility, however, rested with the Colonial Secretary.
lr. LABOUCHERE said it was quite true that a lioense of exclusive trade for five years had been given to certain
,erons who were the first to bring under the notice of the vovernment the existence of large supplies of guano in the islands referred to. The hon, gentleman complained of this arrangement, as evincing great neglect for the interests of Brish agriculture, but it was exactly the course which bad been taken by Lord Derby's Government under similar ciroumstances. The right hon. gentleman the member for Droitwich, when Colonial Secretary, had granted an exclusive privilege of trade for six years to certain persons who had discovered guano on several isluds off the coast of Australia, without any stipulation beyond this, that they should export at least 5,000 tons each year. He had endeavoured to represent to the persons interested in this exclusive privilege the reasonableness of making arrangements to secure a supply of guano for thagiculturists of this country on fair terms, and they hadwillingly consented to allow free trade and a free access to these islnds on the condition of receiving a certain royalty. Before sanctioning this arrangement he had communicated with several of the highest authorities on agricultural matters, particularly with the hon. member for Maldan Mr. E. Denison), thepresident of the Royal Agricultural socmety of England, and with Mr. Caird both of whom were perfectly atisfied with the bargain winch bad been iide. TheGoverninent had made such arrangements as would enable the agriculturists of this country to obtain an ample supply of guano, at a fair price. The attention of the Government had for some time been directed to the im-
portsnceoffacilitatia the supply of guno Lord Clarendon
fromtimie to time called the attention of the Admiralty to the subject, and naval officers on foreign stations had been directed to give immediate information to the Government of any places from which they thought it probable that gutano could be obtained.
Mr. SCOTT asked whether the Government intended to take any measures to prevent the exportation of guano from this country ?
Mr. LABOUCHERE replied, that object could only be effected by an Act of Parliament, and he certainly would not propose any measure to prevent the exportation of guano.
WRECKS AND CASUAI.TIES AT SEA.
lIr. HENLEY said the "abstract of the returns of wrecks and casualtiese lately presented to Parliament was, he thought, calculated to give the public a more favourable impression than the facts warranted. The return contained no account of the number of voyages made, and it was the proportion between the number of casualties and voyages that it was desirable to ascertain. He therefore beggedto ask the Vice-President of the Board of Trade if he had any objection to have a return prepared, showing the number of vesscl entered inwards in the years 1852-3-4-56, dinti guishing the foreign coasting trades, and foreitn nd British ships employed in each respectively; showing the total number oE British and foreign vessels, and the total number of wrecks and casualties in each year, nd the percentage of British and foreign vessels wrecked, or t which casalties had happened in each year.
Mr. LOWE agreed with the right bon. gentlemanu that the returns which e was anxious to obtain would be exceedingly valuable, but he (Mr. Lowe) found that the Government were not in possession of the materials for such returns.

THE HONGKONG ORDINANCE.
Sir i. KELLY wished to ask the noble lord at the head of the Government a question zespecting the ordinanoo paseed by the Legisative Council of Eongkoug, to which reference had to often been made in the course of the late debates on the Chinese question. olding as he did, that that ordinance was altogether iegal, a3i that it was not only higbl' obiectionable on that ground, but had led to hostilities in 5hina, he wished to know whether the Government meant to take any tep for prouring its repeaL I had been wontended in another place, bv the vezy highest legal authority; that the ordinance was legal, upon tnd ncple thtte was comepetent to the Govern. meDt and tnc I2gislatt2re of this country to bind foreign nation4,and, abong others, to bind China, bythelawsof this country, anilthat it wascompetenttoenforceabedienoe to the ordinance of Rom mong. Now, Inasmuch as that was, poicy which lad forthe first timebeen adopted in this country, and, so far as he knew, by every nftion in the world and as it was one calculated to put an end to the amicale relations that subsisted between this and other countries, he wished to ask whether it was the intention of the Government to allow the ordinance of Hongkong to continue to remain in legal force. (Hear.)
1ord PAMERSTOX.-It seems to me that the question of the hon. and learned gentleman goes rather to reopen in a short compess a great pat of that which constituted the engthened debates of the two Houses on the Chinee ques. tion, The hon. and learned gentleman assu;mes that this I ordinance imposes on foreign countries, and imposes on the
Chinese, rrangements which relate only to British law. This question was argued at great length, and the argument in favour ofthe ordinance was tht, so fhrfrom imposing restrictions onthe Chines Government, it was, in fact, intended to aid them in their maritime arrangements, and that it did so aid them by imposing additional restrictions on the use of the British fRag. (Eear, hear.) All I can ny is that I am not aware of any intention to impose British law on foreign nations, and that there is no inten. tion on the part of the Government to dealin any way with the ordinanoe of Hongkong. (Hear.)
The motion that the House at its rising adjourn til kionday was then agree to.

WAYS ALN)D JAEA1S.
On the question that the Speaker do kave the chair, and that the House resolve itself intoa Committee of Waya and
Mr. DISRAELI alid,-I understood from what passed yesterday that the Chanoellor of the Exchequer would to-day make a statement as to the course which the Government propose to tke with regard to financial matters; butafter I left the House I find that the right hon. gentleman mado the staement which I apticipated to have heard from him to-day. I shall therefore take this oppor. tunity fairly and succinctly to state to the House the conue which we on this side were prepared to talke with respect to financial measuDes in o7rdirm-y circumstances, and how far that course mu be modified under the extraordinary circumstances which wo have now to encounter. The Chan. cellor of the Exchequer, in introducing to the House his financidal propoeitions,atedtrulythatthere was a verylarge increase in the incomo derived both from direct and indirect taxes, and be ent-eed into a comparison of the relative amounts which accrued fromn those two souroes. I think the right hon. gentleman stated very aocurately that the dirt taxes had produoed 21,000,000. and the Indirect taxes something more than 39,000,OOOL; bat he omitted one item of no mean Importance, and that was the whole of the local t ion of the country. (Hear, hear.) I need not remind hon. gentlemen of the large amount of that local taxation, nor how materially it alters the balanoe which the Chanoellor of the Exchequer strck In his fancial statement. We have no wish, Sir, to disturb in an way the bance which exists between direct and mndirect taxation. Our opposition to the income-tax has never been founded upon the fact that it is a direct tax, but upon the circumstance that it is a direct tax of the most invidious and intolerable character. It was our view generll, when the Chancellor of the Exchequer originally brought forward those propositions which in a more modified form we are now about to consider, that with wise financial arrangements, perfectly sound in ptinciple and itimate in practice, and with a well-considered reduction of our expendite-a reduction regarded only with respect to the efficiency of the public service, and with no other consideratioi-a reduction which we thould have recommended, whatever mnight be the *ate of the Exche. quer, whether exuberant or exhausted-it would have been possible to make adequata *cial provision for the year without any materiAl addition, if any, to the taxation of the country. We were ready, indeed, notwithstanding those opinions, to conider the propositions of the Government in a spirit which would rather have erred in perhaps unnecessai avouing the Exchequer than in attempting to offer obEtacles to the policy which inEaistera oignaIly recomnende,L There!ore, sofar as the income-tx Was concerned, we were prepaxed to give every possible assistance to the Government onidgtent with maintning the it of the settlement of 1853 Iwould even call it the comp=ct of 18S, andIam rather urprised thata very high -uthorit upn financial subjects in this House-the ri2t hou
teeman the member for Portemouth-shoulcd have dernded that idea of a compact. [Sir F. Baring.-No] On referring to an excellent speecwhich the right hon. baronet msdein 1853, I find be then laid it down mn very strong and nervous language tat the ettlement of that year was a coIc of such a charcter that when 1860 arrived he shoud be surprised to see any miiter bold enouh tocoo. tinue the income-tax. (Hear, he.) With regard, then, to that portion of the finael scheme which assunmed the form of direct taxation, we wished to consider it in the most liberal and concilatoy spirit, and, provided we could have obtained from the Government a virtul pledge thal the compact of 1853 would he fulilled, we should havesported c. eneral poliEcy recommended in that respect. It was with that vievthat Ipre notice of a resolution which while it would not have Injured the Exchequer at the prosent moment, would have secred that in 1860 the incometax would not be higher thanS5d. In the ond. Such was our policy with regad to direct txes. Let nMe now St'e the course we intended topursue with respect to the indirect taxes proposed by the Cbancellor of the Exchequer. The most im rtant of these indirect taxes which the CIoellor of the 9sxchequer proposed to deal with wa tes tea duty. It was our lot, Sir, to propose origu-1l1 that the House skould consider the question of the tea dnty. It ws our opinion that we coul no eal with a tax of more Importance, or one which had aeater inSuence upon the oDmmerce of the country and thegeneral psperit of the people. Great opposition was offered to the consideration of that question. Many persons of very high authority were of opinion that the eeriment was ore which ought not to be mAde. W wer nformed that the quantity of the article on which we proposed to operate was lmited, and that the only consequence of our legila,1 tion would be, the supply nzot being proportionately increased, to injure the revenue without befiting the conxsumers. Neverthele tang the most sedulous means to obtain the very best Minformation on the ubject-and here I may offer omu thanks to a gentlemsn whose name was frcqently mentioned in the recent debates, Sir George Bonham, for the assstanoe he gave us-we believed that the views to which I have referred were erroneousthat the atity of the article was, if I mayn e the epithet, ilimitable, and that if we operated boldly upon the tea dutieswe should greatly stimulate commerce,overy much advane our am uctures, and, above all, oonfers greatbenefit upon the body of the peoyle. We had 2ot the
onor of carrying that measure. It was, fortunately fothe country, carried by our sucesors, andIaksthe nouse whether1 al thebeXncitsantic d tifrom that grt changae have not been folly realized? {Hr, hear.) There hs been no change in our fscal laws which hs operated more beneficially to the great body of the peole lst h5 been proved that the quantity of_thearticle required is really f lismtable.
Thneimmnseincrcaseintbeamounoiwfrim portaioUspto v
that, and everyanticipaon of benefit to commerce, to man-. factures, and to the community generally has beea perfectly realized. W-ith thes views, Sir, and not believig that a great increase of taxion was nece szy, and being prepared to make great sacrifices with respet to increased lonl taxation, believing, too, that when the war cteased the ta
duties ought to fall to the particular amount which they would have touched ha not the war occurred, it was our intention to resist any ehange in the settlement of 18i53 with regrd to the t*a duties. I cannot say that anythinz which has occurred since has at all sken our general views Upon that subject. I do sot want to introduce invidioudy
into this discussion any coideration with repect to the. affairs of China;7 bu-t I 3may perhaps be allowed to obsrv that, if You increase the " duties intead of diminishing them at a time when the supplyof the article is lees, and likely to continue to be so, the consequence must be mosft injurious to the consumer. (Hear, hear,) Let the House observe, however, that we ae Xot now in the boiion in
which we were when the flnaneii ropositionsof the Go. vernment wene offered tOD u& xxy, $.r-- And the poto In which we wreplacedis verydifferent fromr what it wa when the noble visont announced to us yeterdaJ y thi t it was the intention of Her Mxjesty's Min, to appe to

oExeqe-bills, the Government explained to the.

the maoney whieC we were going to borrow, mot as Am addi-. tion to the debt of the country, but in anticipation of the taxes that Pairliament bad actually granted. (Hea!r, hear.) Well, all that was of course very simple and plain. And niow with repect to the plan for redeeming these pledgegL There were 6,000,0001. of these Exchequer-bonuTs isored, towards: the paymaent of which was to bo devoted that halts ytears incoume-tax which would come in after the 5th of ArIl-next, and which would amount to 4,500,0001. or 5,000,D001. 'What is going to be done with that hilf-yer'.5
incometax ? 2,000,0001. of it wil texa-iuly go toward the
payment of these Exchequer-bonds. That as pefcl ih as far as the redemption of' t'he promise of Parliament goes, but thc- other 2,500,0001. of that tax ought, in j'ustice to the promise maLde in 1854 to be applied to t e further reduction of these obligAtions~, and not to ways and mneans; and therefore I maust tell mny right hon. friend that, so far from bis being encumberedwith warobligations lef Ounprovidedfor, for the liquidation of whic'h be is obliged to tax the tea andl sugar of the people, there Is a provision for the discharge of the war obligations, which he as going to apply not to purposes for which Parliament intended it but, for ms-intaining the establishments of the )rar. So urnch for the doctrine of war obligationis; andl venture to say that the more we go hack to 1854. the mnore we regard the intention with which Parliament granted authority to issue those Excheqer-bonds, the mnore we shall see that they were granted in anticipation of taxes the payment of which would always be in a:rrear. There is no ground then, whatever, for the plea that, in order to Nay war obligations, you must lay fresh taxeaupontheteaand suparofthe pole. Perba-ps it wil be convenient to thecommitt-eeif I ahoudnowmake some obs,ervations with rega,rd tothe sugar duties, I thinkthat my right hen, friend made a -very serious error in the case of sugar. I undezstood him to say that the war taxes
upon tea and sugar had been borne wit'hout any aiminution - in the consumiption. Now, the war tax upon sgaprhaLs. caused an extraordinary diminution in the consumption. Another cause-namely, that of hight prices, h-s seriously contributed to that dimiinution withi the last two years. I amn about to refer to ani m1ronths estimate, and that is s-fficient for my purpose, of the eounsumgtion of sugar in 1854. During the first U mnonths of tat year it was
750000 cwt.1; during the same part of thu year 1855 it was 7,178, 000 cwt.; and mn the -first 1 mnonths of 15 It was 6,771,000 cwt.; so that in the course of Only two years in this most important article of sugar there was a decrease of about 800,000 cwt., or an, eighth of t-he whole consumption. (Hear, hear.) Now, that is a serious fact for this House toconsider. (Hear, hear.) We have lahoured, and struggled, and contended for manyyears to reduce the duLties upon sugar. For manmy years the question of the sugar duties, not merely as a question of revenue or protection, hut as-sa queston connected wita high social interests of humaity, was a capital question of debate in this Hous,Teos,i order to inerease the comaforts of the people, inflicted a serious detriment upon the susgar planters in the British oDlonies (hear, hear), the onily class, as far as I know, who have been great sufferers by the transition from protection to free trade. Their condition, I thiink, entitles thema to the fairconsideration of the country. (Hear,hear.) But for the sake of increasing the supyad consumption of sugar by the pole.you not only
sarfcda large revenue, and pDre3udi :erthe interests and
fortunes of a class of proprietors, but you risked and hazarded a1 Ferious evil by giving a new stimulus to the slave trade, 'which you ar constantly endeavouring at an enormous cost to repress. Such was the importance that you aLttached to tbat object. And now, owin3gto the combined influences of high prices, which you could not help, and the war, which was a matter more within your discrtion, you have had within the short space of two ears a reduction in consumnp tien of one-eighth upon the wUole amount.I hi imosble to show more clearly that this is a ma;tter whicshdemands the most careful attention of the House. And it musat not be said that, weithrepet to sugar, the suppliesare so limited that it does not signifWywhether the duty is s. more or Is. less. Thatis the grossestfallacy bnthe world. As regards tea you are great consumers. I speak- in the prm-esec of those who can correct me,but I take it there isno doubt that much mnore than one-half,probably nearly two-thirdS~ of the tea that is exported from China comes to Bu-ni land. (Hear, hear.) And therefore you mnay truly say that when you mnake an alteration in the duty upon tea it wil not very greatly affect the supply to your market in relation to the supplies to othernmarkets, because you have not many other mnarkets to draw upon. Thereois no great area in the supply fromnwhich you can draw tea by the inducements that you hold out by a reduction of duty. But that is not the case with sugar. On the contrary', the article of stigar is produced in enormous quantities and in an immaense variety of countries. Your consumption is now about 350 000 or 360,000 tons. The entire exportable product av_&aiiabl for the use of Eurot and of the United States of America may, I believe,
taken at something not lem than the enormous amount of 1,400,000 tons. Therefore there is an immense area fromn wbich you. can draw yoar augar. And every one knows that in the course of [trade a multitude of ships comne across the Atlantic with cargoes of sugar, absolutely not knowing to what market they are to go. They come first, I believe, to Cowes, where they learn what is the price in London, in Hamburg, in Amsterdam, and other ports, and theygo hi-ro or there in proportion as the inducementofieTed here or thEre is greater or less. Well,that question of inducement is therefore affected by every is. of dutytat you put on or take off. Every is. or every 2s. more or less of duty deterriines to what miarket the ship shall go. Now, Her Majesty's Government are going to lay an additional duty of i. upon sugar, and they think to induoe us to sanctionL that propositibn by tellng us~ that tho supplies of sugar are so small that it is quite unimportant whatwe do -with regard to the sugar duty. Uniless you are pre,pared to continue, without necessity and vithout justification, the grindingprices to which thensecessities of the war droveyou, and which you justifiably adopted, the very fact thLat the stocks of sugar are small ought to prevent you froma laIng any fresh burden upon that article, and induce you rather to reduce than increas the duty upon it. I have stated to the committee what is necessry to put this question insa fair point of view, not wishing to repeat the more general representations which I made on a former eveninig h ut I must again enter my protest against the supposition that we are now called upon to take a c~iurse of m-ere secondary importance. It is represented to us as if this were only adjourning the date at which these duties are to fall-as if- it were only reserving the quaestion for the judgmaent of a new Parliament. It is no such thing. If we can leave the matter an stein o let us dlo so; that sjust what I propose. I propose to leve it in stainquo, and"to let a new Parliament exercise its judgment upon iLt. But do niot under the name of a mere secondary or formal proceeding lead the House into taking the first step insa cours of retrogression upon a path, every onward step on WhIc has showered fresh and fresh blessings on the -people of Eng land. (Hear, hear.) It is very easy to say that this is a sumal matter, that we -are not going to make an increase, but only to postpone adecrease. You are going to postponle a decrease, and under what circumstances? If you adopthb proposal of the Government what sort of an eXam on; r; set to future Chancellors of the Exchequer? You have by law at this mnoment a surplus revenue, and in order, as you say, to make certain reductions, upon w,hich I wfil not now enter, you are going to impose new duties upon tea and sugar. (Hear, hear,.) What wfilibe the probable condition of those who will next year have to reconsider your proposal? What will bo thei propec of a balance between revenue and expenditure? YoZ have now got large and ample meansin your hands. We be to the man who next year stands at that box (referring to the box on the table) to open his budget I You are going to cut away those means, and unless this House take, as I trust it may, views of expenditure very different from those of Hfer Mfajestys Government, you are obviously going to cause an enormous deficiency in the revenue of the year 1858-59. The Chancellor of the Exchequer who in that year shall come dowa to this House and shall ask, not for an increase, hut for a further suspension of the reduction of the duties upon tea and sugar will in all probability have an infinitely bettr eae thau the Governmaent which is now setting the example. If at a time when there is a surlus, this House, in orer to do something which wfil be "ageable to the wealthier classe of this country, a"res to ips taxes upon tea, and sugar, it willafford a fatal precedn to future Governments and future Chancellors of the Exchequer, who one -year, two years, or three 'years hence--it miatters not when-may again propose to arret the reduction of these duties, and who 'willbe able to sy, "1Itis all very well, but you should not have taken the first step. It was the first step which set the example, andl under what circumstances was that ate p taken? You actually haa in your hands the means of deft"- the -whole public expenditure , but the Frittt 1857, which was upon the eve of disolution, left a large deficit, whicht
we ae no caled uo to met Under these cir-
necessary. We must divide these taxes between direct and indirect, and, glad as wo shtould be to see the taxes upon tea and sugr fal to the level of the golden- age of about 1850 or 1851, it is obvious that we are driven, however sorrowfully and however reluctantly,,- to a, fu-rther suspension of their reduction," Sir, I, for my park, am uiost anxious to, avoidl any. thing in the nature -of a factious opposition to, any prto osal, however muchi I -may- object tb-it I wish, With the kind indulgenee of the 116use% to make a, fair and full statement of mly- objections, and if I perceive that the opinions which I individaally entert3in are not largelY saPPorted by the House, .then, after bavingtaken the-sense of the committee,Ishall respectfauly wjithdraw ; hut if those opinious are supported, ase I trust they will be, by this ocommittee, LI shall not shrink froM doin thm al th-0jstc in ny power.- I am deeply con-vinced that the rigidL maintenanoe of the, pledps given, even bay the, Parliament which raise these taxes during-the war is Of -the utmost iIuportance inL itself-of the ntmot ins-

The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.-I have listened with great attention to the speech of my right hon. fiend, but I regret to ay that, as in the case of a former speech of his made during these disus§sions, I am incapable of understanding the drift of the policy which he recommends to us Each pert and portion, each sentenceof myright hon. friend's peeches arebighly polished and refined, but when I attemptto understand them sas a whole they eem to me to be deficient in coherency and inteligibility. In this style of spealdng he reminds me of the sculptor described by Horace,-

(Hear, hear.) I confess that if, setting aside the badget which I have presented to the House, I were now called upon to prepare one founded upon the principleg recoim
ended by my right hon. friend, I should be wholly a'c a losg to know how to caury those principles into effect. (Hesr.) My right hon. friend oomplains of my proposal to arrest the fall of the dutiesrupon tea andsugar,azd, grtly refining upon the words, and perverting them from their obvious meaning, says,-" Wbht you are propoeing is not a reduction, but an incrse of the duty. All Iatk is that you should leave the la as it stands." (Hear, hear.) What my right hon. friend means is this, that a reduction which is a lees reduction than a greater reduction Is not a reduction.
MIr. GLADSTONE-Pardon me I
The CHAICELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.-Let me explain what I understand to be the facts, and then my right hon: friend will see whether I have not expressed his ideas in correct language. The preaent duty on tea Is Is. 9d. -pound; by law it would on the Ist of April next fall to Is. 3d. a-pound. Ipropose from the 1st of April a duty of ]a. od. a-pound. What I msaintainis,thatto alter the dutyfromis.9L.toIs.5.is areduction. Myzighthon friendsaysthatiti anincrease, because it is a less reduction than a greater reduction; therefore I have quite correctly interpreted his meaning when I xsy that he contends that a reduction which is a less reduction than a greater reduction is not a reduction. (" Hear, hear," and a sight laugh.) At all events, what r propose should be the duty from the 1st of April next,. although itis higher than that which would be the duty if the law was to talke foll effect, h a less duty than that which now exists. Then I take it it wnll hardly be disputed that a change from l6d. to 7d. upon inconles above 160L, and of lld. to 5d. in thepound upon in. comes between I601. and 1001., is also a reduction. It wi
further not bo denied, that when I take no measues for in. terfering with the fall of the war duty upon malt, that also is a reduction. The same is the ceso with regard to coffee, the entire reduction of the duty on which, fixed by law, wil tako effect. I made a statement on a former night which my righthon. friend (Ar. Gladstone) has characterized in no very messured terms as calculated to deceive the country. I certainly did inadvertently use the words, that I pro. posed certain reductions of duties, whereas I ought to have said that, in consequence of the plan which I proposed, cer. tain duties would be reduced. With the explanation which I have now given, can anything be more unfsir than to assert that I have introduced a budget the main charm. teriatic of which is the increase of taxation? (Hear, hear.) Any stranger in this House who listened to the speech of my right hon. friend would suppope that at the close of a war I was bringing forward a plan for adding to the burdens of thegpeople. Al that he can accuse me of doing is the not allowing the whole of the contemplated reduction of taxes to take effect. Iam not arrestingthe entire reduction, but merely qualifying it to a certain extent. In order to prevent all misunderstanding I will aaitn read what the remissions, according to rates calculated for the whole year, 'will be for the ensuing year, as compared with the amount at which these imposts stood during the peiod of the highest wartaxation,two year
ago :-There will be a redction of 2,000 0001. on malt, 9,125,COO. on the income-tax at the war scae, 600,0001. on tea, 135,0CO. on coffee, and 33420001 on sugar, maldng altogether upwards of 12,200,0001. It is quite true, as my right hon. friend reminded the House, that the whole of that reduction will not accrue within the financial year, inasmuch as it is well known that taxs are not always paid at the time they be. come duoe but that is the only way in which you can estimate remissions of taxation. I reiterate, then, quite delibe. rately, the statement which I made on a former night, that taldnF the taxation of the present year aS compared with the highest taxatiou duing the war there will be a relief to the country of more than 12 millions sterling. (Hear.) My right hon. friend says all he asks Jo that we shoutld leave the law as it is. Very well, Sir. If he places me in the posiffion of making a bargain with him for the Exchequer, and assumes that I have interests distinct from the public-a theory which, by the way, I always dispute-I say I am ready to take the law s ait stands. Continue the war income-tax for the next year ("hear, hear," and a laugh)-let the tea and the sugar duties go down; and the Exchequer wi be an enormous gainer. By that rrange. ment a much larger sum will be levied from the pblic than by the plan I propose. 'What my right hon. friend does, however, is this: he takes al the plums from the pudding-he does not take the rough with the smooth, bat Iceepsthesmoo.h to himself and leaves the rough tome. 5Laughter.)He says, "1I deny You theincrease (as he callsb it) of the tea and sugar duties, but Iwbill exact from yOU the remission of the income-tax." And that, forsooth, he calls leaving the laLw as it isI I cIa't understand hor he could have thought theHouse would overlook a consideration so obvious; andI must only suPpo5e that amid the labynth he pursued in the course of his speech he loEt his .Clue, nd became bewrildered by his own ingenious calculations. (" Hear, bear," and * laugh.) Hesid that I denouncedprospeciveslegislation uponthe teadaties andhe alsEO referred to the scheme introduced by the rih on. gentleman the member for Bucldngbamshire, when Chancelor of the Exchequer for prospectively reducing those duties. He might likewise have enumerated. if he had deemed it worthy of mention, the Act thLtI myself proposed on the same subject, and carried through this House. That Act, which is now the law, established the very fhll in the duties which I now seek to arrest. It must, therefore be evide-nt that I can have no insuperable objection to prospectivelegislationrespecting the duties on tea or any other dut4eswithregardto which it mayseem possibletoproposea prospectivereduction. Indeed, thepoli cof roepectereduce tion is quite familiar to the House, and Ireally can't conceive how my right hon. friend should imagine that anybody can have any fundamental objection to sowell-knofn and so recognized a piinciple of legislation. My reason for not recommending a prospective reduction of the duty contemplated by the resolution before the House as was clearly Btated by my noble friend at the head of the Government yesterday, and also indicated by me, was that we did not think ourselves justified, in our present circumstances and in the provisional position of legiation, in proposingto go beyond whatis a toluelyneessary for theservce of the year. I proposed at the beginning of the sesion prospective duties for three years, both upon tea and sugar, thereby Pla1DIy indicating that I was not hostile to prospective taxation; and I withdrew that part of the plan referring to the twro hast of those three sews in thersesoluffoncs of which I gave notice yesterday, on the sole anDa simple ground Of the altered position of the Government. Sir, af mutet)e
to carry more than is essential for the requirements of'the year, is there the smallest doubt that labould have been met with the very reasonable objection that I was asking the House for more than wasnecesry, and more tban, according to our own showing, we have a right to ask? For the same reason that we have confined our demand to six months' supply, and propose also to limit the Mutiny Act to a similar period, we are equa boumd to ask for taxes for only one year. We could ay,I sppose, ask for taxes for a shorter time than a year, IWobody ever heard of taxes being enacted on tea and sar for a. period of ai months. Oar merchants have to scud out their orders to places at a remete distance, and it is important to the mercantile community that it should know beforeband what re to be
the taxes for at least a twelvemonth. So loitth income- X-it is neery thlt it should be fixed fora year. But beyond a year it is not needful togo,an or. thataowtnt alDon I have re*rited my proposition to one year, and not because of any ipathy to prospective
egislation. (Hear, bear.) I noW Come to 6 part of my right hon. friend's speech which, I confess, puZzIled ad perplexed me more than any otherthe part, I mean, which referred to the redemnpthon of tea war loas. He says that 4,500,(OO. which wil bhe ollected in the ensuing year, as arrears of the high income-tax, in the current year ought to be applied to the redemption of Exchuer.bonds. Well, 2,000,O000. will be so
spplied, i the House thinks fit to grnt suffcient ways and Means for the orvoe of the year. If my right hon, friend's propoal to refuse the increase ln the tea and sugar duies ihould be acceded to, I presume t.he eultwlouldbeothatitwould.bezecessnyto borrow again for thedischarge of2,000,0001. of Excbequer-bonds; for itis nece9cary the debt should take the precedenco of aU your curent expenditure. Therefore his proposition, Iyan inVitaLble consequenoe, would lead to the postponement of tbe redemption of these bonds. A.s far san understand hi5 doctrine, it is that we ought to apply 4,5WO,01, that woud be received next year in resPect of the war inoometax, to the redemption of the Exchequer.honds.

(Hetr, hear.) There is an objection, I think, to the proposition of the Chanoellor of tho Exchequer,-one whlich, it Is admitted, peculiarly applies to the article of tea. It has been found that a cle falLing from yer to year produoes very injurious eonsequenoes to trade, that during ol about nine meoutb of the

This is a Terj grt inconvenienco; and, whether the duty were ls. 4d. as I proposed, or Is. 6d. as the Chanoellor of the Exchequer now propos, or Is 3d. as the law states, I should havo been betteratisfia if it h been ettled for three years at a uniform atm. (Hear, hear.) There is no article with retpect to Which the benefits of a large consmption arising from diminished duties and increased buness are more apparent than She acticle of tea. The conummption, whieoh in 1837 w,n about sq. millions ot pounds; wai ia the isat two years upwards of 63 millions of pounds, being an inecresaoeot x7re than 100 per oent. It is remnakable, however, that dulring thelat year, with the high duty, there w3asafallingof zather than an increse. IthinkLit would be of great Advantageif the daty could be settled for a longer period, but as no fairer course can be taken I shall oertainly not offer any oppoftion to the proposal of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Mr. RICARDO said, it was distinctly understood by the trse, from an answer of the Chancellor of the Excheqaer toe deputation, that the war duties on tea, auar, And coffee would terminate on the 5th of April next, tier'hthon. gentleman having said that there ws no pronl inthe last soesiontoprolongthe periodatwhichthosedutegr wouldeea. This statement was considered to be an Intimation tht it Was not the intention of the Government to depart from the existing law, and it was sated upon by the trade. Bat this opinionL of thieirs did uot restupon that statement alone, because so late as the end of November, 1850, a gentielrsn, baving some idea that the usual eourse of tampering with the tea duties would be taken, wrote to the Customs to ask what was to be done, and he received the following answer to his letter -
"Board of Customs, Nov. 17, 185.
'Sir,-I ant directed by the Commioners of Customs to acquaint you, in reply to your appliication of the l1th inst., that the reduction of the duty upon tea from Is. 9hL to s. 3d. will take place on the 6th of April, 1857,
"I am, d.c. ' W. ACLgAN,"
Of course, this letter would not havo been written without previous communication with tho Treasury.
M[r. WILSON,-No reference whatever was made to thb Treasury by the Commisdoners of Customs in respeot t, that letter.
Mr. RICARDO.-Then the officers of the Customs must be in every had state of subordination if they were allowea to wite such letters as this to mislead tho public. (BEer, hear.) But there must have been some sort of communica. tion with the Treasury, because a short time after the following letter was written in answer to a gentleman in the trade wvho had made an application in reapect to sugar-

With reference to the ternm of the existing Act of Parliament, and as sugar and eofboo are placed in the table of duties annexed to the Act 18th arnd 19th Victoria, cap. 97, under terms similar to thoseap plicalble to tea, as regards the prospective reductiou'in the rates ol duty chargeable thoreon, asuch reduction of duty will tuder that Act takre place at the same period-viz., the 6th of April, 18S7.
" I am, Gentlemen, your most obedient servant,
W.MACLuAu."
No doubt in this letter thero was a reesrvation which would enable the Secretary for the Trasury to deny that it was actually stated that the duty was to come off on the day stated "Hear, hear," from Mr. Wilson), but the trade wAs misled by the letter, and understood it to mean that there was no intention on the part of the Government to interfere with the reduction of duty which was to take place on April 6, 1857. He could not agreo altogetber with the noble lord the member for the City of London that this was a tax of which every consumer boro an equal share. A Id. or 2d. im the pound was nothing to a rich man, but it was a great deal to a poor man, who spent a much larger proportion of his income in tea and asugar than a rich man did. (Hear, hear.) These frequent changes, too, did great damage to our trade. While we were raising our duties upon sugar the United States were loweringtheiss, and tho coneqence was that sugar went therefrom our colonies instea of coming to our markets, aud thus the commerce and industry of our country suffered. Bat the greatest evil of all was thc clasification of sugars. Theoi
wore threo elements in classilfication-tho grain, the colour, anDdthe saccharine matter; but the colour was the princi. pal. There rwre all sorts and *hadeg of colour-whiti6h yellow and yellowish white, whitish brown and brownish white, yellowish brown and brownish yellow; but the shades of difference were so minute that scaicely Anyone could tell which was which. The consequence was that different duties were levied on the same sort. of sugar, not only at different ports, but even in different docks in tho same port, and the Secretary of the Treasury was obliged to bo econtinually changing the standard. There had boen cates in which the Custom-house officers being unable to decide to what dals cextain sugars belonged, had h ad to send up to the Treasury for a standard or ample to help than to judge by. Some tirie ago he had applied to the Secretary of the Treasury to k-now if there would be any objection on his part to a return of the complaints which b d been muade of sugr%s being
iade to pay a higher rate of duty than that to which they were actually liable, and the hon. gentleman had told him in replythat, though he had no objection to the return, yet it woud be so voluminous, wonld take such a long timo to draw up, and would cost so much in printing, that it wOulM be better not to press for it. This clasification did nogood whatever. It was simply protection indisguise, (Heat.) The present systemof protection enabled thoelower sorts of sugar from Demerara Berbicet and other colonies to bo brought into the market at a priceat which the better sorts of sugar could be obtaiued if tho duties were leveL He was informed that the los from waste upon low museavado sugr was about 10 yer cent, on the vo7age alone, and generaluy ing, takng the oontingenoies of a voyage, the shipper lost from 18 to 20 per cent while upon good descriptions of sugar such wste would 6e avoided. It was ecaulated the lessin weight was equalto 460,445 ewtz., sad in valueto 259,O000 The present sytem enoouraged the introduction of sugars which Were of a most deleterious nature. Most hon. genUtlen were aware that an inquiry hadlatelybcen institated bytboSroprietors of theLanecditiu tboadulter-ation ofva2ious-rticle6 otfood inthemnetropolft. and he would read to the House the result of that inveetiption with regard to ugar. The Lancet said
"The impure sugars are dark- coloured, imperfectly crystallized, lheav;, clammy, and damp, readily caking into messes;exairned with the microscope they areofoundtto cont in framents of cane, woody fibre, grit, Ie and to abound with animalculm or scari, and sporules of fungi. Ve havy seen that nearly all tho brown sugars impored into this country contain a large amount of impurity, bttin general thoangar procured from tbh roccrs does not alone contain this same amount, but it is increased, somnetimes doubled and trebled, by the ve of variablo proportions of other sugrs still more impure, in fact, the most im,nr' that can bo purbhed, so that in the state in wnich It rachuesthe public itis entirely,uvol

viscount, to seveso our decision with respect to China, how can we expect it to bohonind by the decision of a moribund
respect to taxation? I think iet would be well for the House to consider whether at the present moment we cannot do better than vote new taxes under circamstanccs which deprive us of all autho rity, and which, if not in & legal, at least in a consututtonal sense, render it impossible for us to deal vitb the prpero of our constituents. Wbat would be the conxqnenoei IThe new House is to meet in May. We can have the budget in May. Wehave often had the budget in May. In 1848 the budgetwasbrought forward in August. Ona questionso important as that of direct or induect taxation, involving considerations of so various and so momentous a character, it wonld be much better that the new House should be left to decide, unaided by the judgment of a House which bas been deprived of all authority, and which, constitutionally, has no right any longer to deal with the property of the people. (Bear, hear.) What power has this House of Commons to pus laws that the people of England shall psytaxes for a year hence, when our authority wss virtually destroyed the moment that the noble lord made the announcement which ho did last night (ea, hear. Under these circumstanoes Sir, I hope that the House wi l well consider before agreeing to grant any new taxes, for we are not in a position in which wo are uiosed in dealing with the property of the people. If we take the course which I have suggested we shall abridge the period which it is necessary should elapse before we recur to tho country. Every onvenience which the noble lord can require, every asistance which it is possible to render in order to being about the de6ired cossunmuation, I shall be most happy to give. Let his Mutiny Bil be ped; let his vote of men be agreed to, under the oondition mentioned yesterday of its being a aVUtMwn amount; let him have a vote ofcredit ad everything that Is necessary for the public service, but don't let us cancel and revoke solemn engagements when our authority as a representative asembly is about to expire; don't let us be called upon to put our hauds into the pockets of the people and to levy now txes (Cheerm) We shall presently have a proposition brought before us which, if carried, wiUl have the effect that I desire with regard to indirect taxe, and will prevent any addition to them; and 'when we come to the income-tax i sball ask the House to adopt a eourse which Will as far as possible secure the arrangement of 1&53, and which will provide that the ncome-etx shall be, not 7d., but 5d in the pound. (Cheers.)
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCREQUEB.-I hope to be able to atisfy the House that the course which I am about to ask it to take -is not only reasonable, but necessary, under the circumstances of tho case. The right hon. gentleman eontends that we havo no power to bind the deision of the next Parliament, and I quite agree with him in that view-unquestionably we have no such power; and if the propositions which I am about to maske hould be agreed to it would be competent for that ParlE;nent to alter or repeal those propositions. Neverthelees, it is necessary that we should deal with the taxtion of the country with respect to that Interval of time which will elapse between the end of the present financial year and the tlmewhen the legsl ative action of the new Parliament can come into operation. If the argumentg of the right hon. gentleman respecting the duties upon tea and sugar wero vlid, they would equaly apply to the income-tax; and he himaelf proposs that we should now, from the lst of April next, alter the existing incometax, which is fixed by Act o Parliament. The Act of 1853, to which he proposes to revert isrepealed by an Act passed in 185, which is now thelawo! the land; and unles that be repealed the income-tax of ld. Inthepound would be leviable for the ensuing financialycar It isju as muchinthepower of Parliament toalterthat.Aol and to revert to the 5d. fixed by the Act of 1853 as it is to suspend the fall in the tea and sgar duties, and to fix them at the amounts which I have proposed. The plan whieh I 3mbmitted tothe House was that the Ways and Means of the presnt year should be supplied by a fair balanci between direct and indirec taxation. I proposed, there fore, to reduce the inoome-tax from l6d. to 7d. in tht pound, which would have diminished the amouni derivable from direct taxation, and, as that would leav a deficit in the Ways and Means of the year, I pro posed to supply that deficit by a small addition to the duties on tea and ugar. If that addition should no! be made before the Ist of April next the low dutics would come into operation, Immediately a large quantity ol tea and sugar Would be released from bond, and it would not be oompeten for Parliament when ii re-sembled in May to deal with the question accord ing to itg deliberation. But if the Houee will take thi cousc which I propose it will be open to the new ParLia ment to revise that decision, and to mLke any reduction it the duties upon tea and sugr and in the income-tax whict it zay think fit. (Hear, hear.) In the meantime n( other plan will so well moet the exgencies of the preseni year as that which reduces the income-tax to 7d., and arrests the descent upon tho texaad sugar duties whicb would takeplaceaccording tothe existing law uponthe Lit oc April rext. That arrngemoent is cosistentwith the financial exigencies of the yea, and in either case the interference efthe Legislature wll be required. It is the duty of this Houseto exercise such a powerunder the presenteircum.
tances, audit implis no greater exercise of legisltive power than tbhe voting Of SUPPly} pessing the Wa' an d Mrsan; and yagreing to an appropraton Act, authorizing the Governmn et during the next six months to apply the ps-educe oE taxes to the current ass-vice of the year. Alter the announcement of the right hon. gentlemanyesterday, that he would offer no impediment to the necessary measures for the services of the year, I hoped that we should not have been met with a refsal to supply the requisite Ways an Means according to the financial plan already subznitted. (Hear, hear.) lf the course propoed by the riiht hon. mber forBucksngbamshire were ad opte and the in come-tax were reduocrito 5d.inthepound, and if our mepsure with reprd to the tea and sugar duties were rejected, there would inevitably be a deficiency according to the etimates for the expenditur of the year. The right hn. gentleman mnay say that there will not be a deciency because he wl reduoe the estimates in committee of supply; but let us go fist into committee of smpply ana mee if tae reduction can be effec becase until that is done it i6 the duty of this Hou,e to ind ifficint ways *na nd eas to meet the estima=te of the exenditure of the year. Itrust, therefore, that the propolo the right hom gentleman to refus the necesay means for covering that estimated expenditure Wll not be aooeded to by the House, after the fair, but as it appears delusive, promiss wshich be made yesterday. (Hear, bear.)
Mr. GLADSTONE suggested that it would be for the convenience of the House if the Speae r at once left the cbhirland the dision ere taken regularIy in cam31nittee.
Mr. ROEBUCK said that he had bee intrustod with a petition upon this sabject from the Grocers' Commercial Association, but as the forms of the House would not permit of his p senting it At thatperiod of the evening, he would state the substance of it. The petition set forth the inconveniene of retaining a higher rate of duty upon tea and sugar than wsproposed b the Act of 185, and suggesting thatn pa Eatotic House of Commons would rather tax inividuo qof its own class than the poor, roeommended that the dus upon those artices shoud be reduced, and that the income-tax shiould be 9d. insted of 7d. in the pound from the 5th oE April next.
Mr. T. BARI;G said that the right hoeo. gentleman the Dember for the University of Oxford proposed resolutions with regard to indirect taxes but he had not gatheed from hin that h had an objection to mnaintain the inoome-tax st 7d. in the pound. The right hon gentleman the member for Buckinghiam0ire proped, as he understood, to reduce tbe duties upon sugar a tea to the rates agreed upon in 1853, and alsotoreduce thze icome-taxrtonce to5d. Heh(e r Baing) cofessed that that proposition rather alanmd him with reapeettothe revenue Af the connta7. (tear, bear.) He had voted for the reolution of his right hess. friend, which ws, in point of fact, intended to refer the estimates back to the Gorernment, becaue he considered that

Tbe Hloue then went into committee.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCnEQUER, in riing to move a solution relating to the duties upon tea, aid,Before I submit the resolution which xtauds upon tbe ppe in my name Iam desirous of offering some observafioam* wbich will apply to the proposition which I have now to make and also to certain objections which wores taken to the sebnme in its original and mnore extende4 form. The object which I have ha in view has be&t,
to modify in amount the direct taxation which presauponi the country in the shape of the inoomne-tax, ena to reduce that tax tothe amount at which it stood before the eOM meneement of the war. I must remind the committeoe tha since the introduction of the incomo-tax by Sir R. Peel Ir& 1842 no attempt has been imade to increase the ratebe. yond 7d. in the pound, except upon one oocesion, wihen it was made by the noble lord the member for the otiy. Lookinz at the strong feeling which pervaded the eotmntry upon tbe subject of tho income-tax, and to the desire hich seemed to prevail throughout all classe, not even ex6epting the class upon which the income-tax does not direclpress, to revert to the rate existing beforo the war, it appeared to the Government expedient to recur to that amount, and t o mnako up whatever deficiency existed in the annualtaxat}iom by a small increase in the indireci taxes. Theduties altered during the war were the spirit duties, the mal duties, and the duties upon tea, sugar, and ooffee. Tho spirit duty has been fixed by a permanent Act of ParTha, ment. That alteration is not temporary; it wil eontince until altered by this House, and it producer in round nun. bers the sum. of 1,500,000L, in addition to the ratez wWLch existed before the war. I stated on a former evening, inz
ferncoe to something which fell from the right hon. gentloman the member for Carlisle, that that might be taken an a permanentaddition to the income of the country as settled during the war; that no further legislation on the subject is required; and that the present rate is fixed by a perana. naent Act, and would be collected until changed byfaturo legislation. Wel, then, I come to the malt duty. That duty ceased by the operation of the Act on the 5th oZ July lst. No doubt it woula have been competent to ms In tho last session of Parliament to propoze the pro. longation of that duty until tbe end of the present fiancil year, which would havesffordedto the Rouse an opportunty, before tho expiration of this year, of reconsidering the thoe
existing rates with a view to continuo some portion of the increased war duties. However, last session I statod my remon for not proposing any interference with tho expiration of those duties, although, no doubt, last yearras substantillya year of war expenditure. My reason was that, partly in consequenco of the high prico of barley, and partly inconsequenco of the operation of tho ineased war rate, the consumption of malt had undoubtedly been diminished during the oour of the war. I therefore thought, on the whole (looking to the fact that under the opaftion of the duties on colonial produce the consumption of tea anud sugar had notiandergone a diminution), thatit ws expedient not to interfere with the malt duty. Leaving that duty therefore, untouched, the only indirect taxes with which it was compotent to me to deal at the oommencement of the present year were the duties upon tea and sugar. The duty on teawasfixed at Is 7d., tofallontheensulnglstofAprilto ls. 5d. I may say in round numbers that evezy 2. in the pound on tea produes 500,0001.; each ldh of duty is thu3 equal to 250,000 L Under these circumstances, looking to the necessity of obtaining an addition to the revenue, it seemed to me that the duties upon tea and sugar offered.. fair ground for levying that taxation which was reqiired for the wants of the year, and that not by incre those duties, nor by preventing their fail altogether, bt Lropo,ing a descent less in amount than wouldhave taku place under tho existing lav, I waS enabled to fmtno a scheme which would rsise a sufficient revenue to meet the estimated expenditure of the year. On reconsidering tho matter, I think the House WMll come to the conclnsion thatthe proposxl I madois a fair nee and it is one to which it is necessary their assent hould be given before the 1tt of ApriL If the duty bad not fallen upon the 1st of April I might have run some risk of loss and might have left tho decson to another Parliament- but inasmuch as it w&& necessay, in order to fulfil the piodge which has been given to the country to reduoe the war mnoome-tax-whicb, unless this House interferes, w1il bo leviable at sI 4d. in the 1L from the lst of April next, it semed to me a reasonablo proposition at the same time to arrest the entare fall of th
duties Upon tea and sugar. In recomamending that plan of providing for the ways and means of the yer I cited a pasa,e froma a celebrated writer whom m h right hon friend(r. Gladstone)familiarly,and humorousysp.- pose, but not very affectionatelyx styed aola Youn
Isugh)-old Arthur YoUng. Now m the first place, I would remark that Arthur Young is a writer of great eminence and oelebrity (hear, hear), and has been recognized as sutch by all economical authorities. His fame it not confined at
this countrr-it is of European extension. Isr rorks wera translated mnto French by the direction of the French Government He even, I believe, received a reward from tho pulsian Government, which perhaps will mitigate the asperity of some gentlemen towards him (laughter); and with the produce of that rewrd I believe he purchasiedsa cstate in the Crimea, though what has becomoeof that estte, and whether it is possessed by his descendants, I don't know. But his antiqnity is complained of. Now, I don't know why my right hon. friend should seek to diminish Arthur Young's authority by conplaining of his antiqtity. The language used by my right lhon. friend would ratber lead one to suppose that this w Wa
ancient writer, whose opinions were obsolete and had no reference to the existing state of thin Now Arthur Young, published works whic a oseabearing upon eveats in modern times, and considering that his death took place 1he was then, certainly, at an advanced age) so late Ss 182D, I think I sm justified in citing him as an authority of to very groat antiquity. (Hear.) But I wish to exPlain to the committeo my msnaninria qaotingfromn his works. I adduced a saying of his which condemns simplicity In matters of taxation2 and, with great deferenee to my right lion. friend, I mnustmaintain that that dictum, wrhencorrectly understood, isa perfeclr sound one. Whatthatdictum condemnedwas the attempt to raie revenue from one groat article of taXAtion, such as sOme great and all-absorbingtarmnon property -for example, thesystem which obtains n Oriental eountries of providing for very nearly all the expens of tho Govenment by aland-a Thatisn instanee of thesystem which the dictum I have quoted intended to condemn. Arthur Young meant to sY, " ImcPOe t xes upon different branches of industry and produce, and don't attempt toraie your revenue from one such brancb, either in the shapo of direct or indirect taxation." He bad in view such a systom as that which exits in this country, and, certainly, whea I quoted his words, I did not wish it for
moment to be u pposed that 1 w s rewommending a reversa of tho policy recommended by Sir IL Peel, or that when I condemned simplicity in taxation I meant to recommend complexity. Mvrihthon. friend talked of simplicityas op,cosedtooornpexity, where s I nderstood it merelyas opposed to variety. Nor, it steems to have been supporse
that in the proposal which I made I have attempted to introduce principles altogether inconsistent with the doctrines; of free trade, and it issaid that I have, so far asamy spech was concerned. " thrown overboard, condemned, repudiatem -as far as the act of one year can go-principles of SnncOe which wereintrodneod a mla ddliffesandaerglct, which werefirst extensively applied when the partyoppostews in power." Nowr, I sam really at a loss to undrstand uapon what gromund it can bo said that the proposal wiech I tnado with rcspeet to the duties upon teand sugar s in any way inoonsistent with the principles oi libera ltgislation Srts Iangrafted upon our existing arifrwhen the party opposite wasnpower. Byfreetrade I do not understand ampl
the duties upon importd article, but duties of a pro. aibitory nature (her), and in a duty imposed upon suclt artics as teand sugar, not grown in tis ecountry, simply for nurposes of revenue, I see nothing inc.,..'A.*{wt with tle doctrines of free trade. Undoubtedly, everysuch daty rises the pnice of tho article importd, and theby in.
DiCtS an inry upon the consumer; but so long asit ii raised merely for purposes of revenue, so as the objet is not to favour one oountry or one class of producers at the cost of another, or to obstruct or Intereept trsde, it cannot be said that any such duty as inoon. sitdent with the principlee of free trde ledilatlen. It has been also alleged that our presnt fnancuTposition is gloomy and calcated to inspire us with m that w axreadvancing dilyto state otehi in rhther wiU be a deficient revenue, and that unls some rou interposition of the athoty of t House ta plc w must expect some extensve financial cage It ms to me, however, that after a proper discuion in Committee of Supply ourexpenditure tillhe Noxed fata letimate amomt Whenever that legitimate amount shl hve en detr minred, can it bo doubtod that the regoureceaf thif ountry are amply sufficient to raise, without any oppreion of te pcop1o, revenuo enough to eover the curent expenditure? ,Tere never WAS a time when the grt branehes of prcduetion-oir agriculture, commnerce, and nanufoacures, were in a snder or more aisfactory state or on , more expansive ale.

The question having been put,
Mr. GLADSTONE said,-Sir, I came down to the Houae withthoanxious desire toaddressmyself to the question that lanow before us0 which is astriotly practical question, and to Confine myself entirely within the limits which the terms of mny motion pointed out. My tight hon. friend (the Chan. 0ellor of the Exchequer) has entered on a, very wide field of discumsion, and has rephod to much of a general chara cer ha has been contained in our previous debates on th lmdget, while he has devoted considerable time and atten. flen to a vindication of the fair famo of old Arthur Young. (A. laugh.) I do not proPose to follow my right hon. friend hnto those debates. One thing only I will say, because is beur on the subject now before us. My right hon. friemn says that he does not consider the prooeedings of the Government during the present year are in plia. rlpie opposed to those operations which I described As having been commenced amid arduous labouis under circumstances of struggle and difficulty, and first of all extensively and systematically entered on at a time when the late Sir Robert Peel held office My right hon. friend ays, and I perfectly agree with him, that the principles of froe trade are distorted and mnsunderstood if they are supposed to abolish all indirec' tAt qp. The comparative merits of direct amd indireo' taxation may be a subject for intellectual exerc itation,; Wt
I entirely agree with my right hon. friend, that in. direct taxation is deeply and inextricably rooted in our financial system, and that it is neither praoticabls nor possible to get rid of it. I still, however, hold that the sprit of these proposals is adverse to the principles on whioh the operations of the last 15 years have been conducted. What were those principles? There were many measures adoptd of the greatest importance, and eminently beneficial to the country, which had no eonnexion with prohibition or protection. (Hear, hear.) Why did we abolish many duties on exports ? Why did we abolish many hundreds of duties upon articles that were productive of extremely small amounts to the revenue ? That great process of abolition, which has immensely simplified our financial system, bad nothing to do with protection. (Hear, hear.) But the main object of all those operations has been this-quite apart from questions of prohibition and protection-to afford an extended, a judicious, and a permanent relief to the consumcrz of those great commodities imported from abroad which are essentially connected with the comforts of the great mass of the population. (Hear, hear.) That has been the funda. mental principle and the capital feature of all those operation&s It bas beenone on which, happily, there has beenno conflict whatever of party opinion in thls House, and on that account I contemplate it with all the greater satisfaction andl I regr et the more seriously and bitterly that the plans cf Her Majesty's Government during the present year, for the first time, make an attack on those measures. (Oheers.) Now, we are placed in great difficulty with regard to the whole of our proceedings as respects the finances and expenditue of the country. The hon. baronet opposite (Sir H. Willoughby) is, in my judgm cnt, perfectly right. I know no reason why we should deal with the Ways and Means rather than with the Supplies in the first instance. We are involved in the greatest difriculty in consequence of the course adopted in thlis respect by the Government. We are called on to provide ways and means, and we don't know what it is we are going to provide them for. (Hear, hear.) In 1845 Sir Robert Peel had recourse to a different mode of proceeding from the ordinary one, but it was under circumstances altogether dissimilar from the present, and therefore the course taken on that occasion affords no precTdent whatever for this inversion of the usual mode of procedure. I repeat therefore that the House is now placed in a very great difficulty. I feel the full force of what has teen stated by the right hon. gentleman the member for Buckinghamshire. He says, you are a Parliament on whom notice to quit has been served, and just at the time you receive that notice to quit you are called on to impose new taxes on the people. I think that is a very solid and sub5tantial remark, and it has not been got rid of or impaired bythe observations thatfellfromthohon. memberforHuntingdon (Mr. T. Baring). It appears to me that he has entirely misunderstood the facts of the case, and I think the language of my right hon. friend (the Chancellor of the Exchequer) tends to create that misunderstauding. He says he is not increasing the duties on tea and sugar. He means that he is not going to levy after the 5th of April a heavier duty than is levied now. But he is going to levy a heavier duty after the 5th of April next than would be imposed by law undor the existing arrangement, and therefore he is laying a new tax on ta and sugar. (Hear, hear.) The hon. member for Huntingdon says my solution proposes to take away that portion of ways and means which arises from indirect taxation. There cannot be a more unfounded objection. I contend that while the motion I am about to make is in perfect conformity with recent policy, it is likewise in entire harmony with the principle laid down by the right hon. gentleman opposite. I lament that the forms of the House have required me to place my resolution upon the votes in a shape which may lead those gentlemen who have not taken the trouble t
look into the Acts of Parliament to suppose that I am interfering with the course of existing law, and that I ama going to ta-e away from the Government ways and means which the existing law gives them for application to the public service. (Hear, hear.) That, Sir, is a total misapprehension. The request which I make is, I believe, a moderate one, and certainly I shall do my best to press it upon the attention of the House. You are going to take away from the income-tax that which is now leviable by law, and which had been granted by Parliament for the purposes of war. I say, do not, in order to relieve yourself, or in connexion with any attempt to relieve yourself, from the pressure of the income-tax, impose any now burdens upon tho tea and sugar of the people-burdens which Parliament, when it granted the war taxes, never contemplated, and which, as the law now stands, it is not lawful to continue. (Hear, hear.) My noble friend the member for the city of London (Lord J. Russell) replied to me upon a former night in respect to this subject, and he did so in a tone which I think ought to have saved him from those imputations which were so freely cast during the China debate. It is not too much to say that the view he took of my speech and the opinions contained therein ought entirely to have relieved him from any imputation of being a party to factious combination. I thought in his observations-of which I ani not entitled to complain, but which certainly indicated considerable hostility to the views I had advanced (" hear," and laughter)-my noble friend complained that I had spoken in a manner calculated to attract the gcodwil1 of hon. gentlenien opposite. Now, Sir I am flad to as'uire goodwill anywhere that it can be obtained tairly and honourably, for it is not an abundant commodity. In venturing to reply to the observations of my noble friend I can assure the House I shall.never say anything inconsistent with the respect I bear towards him, or with my gratitude for bis generous-perhaps, over generous-support of all measures connected with the desartinent over which I presided, and which I introduced auring his.Government. Having said so much, I now venturo to observe that my noble friend's objection to my views was a bad one. He said, " You are complaining that thore is to be a deficiency in the revenue ; you likewise object to the nroposals to raise additional revenue by means of increased dutes on tea and sugar." It is true I was then complaining of a deficiency of revenue, and I am now complaining of an attempt to increase the duties on tea and sugar; and I ap. peal to my noble fdrend to say whether I am not in the exercise of my right and duty, as a member of this House, in doing both these things? It is my duty to complain of a deficient supplv of waysand meansto meetthepublicexpenditure, and it is also my duty to
oocsto any particular ways and rmeans which appear to ine to be open to such great censure and objection that tbey ought not to be permjitted for the public service. We shall, I hope,have a future opportunity of considering how far the proposed expenditure is open to debate; but I must sa
in reference-to what hat fallen from the hon, memiber foyr 'tuntingrlon (Mr. T. Baring), I am not aware that the H House-of. Commons has come toany such pretentous deternii. nation Os he attributes to the decision arnved at uon the re-
solution oftheright. hon. memberforBuckingbamshir-of an
Implied sanction of the estimates upon the table. I disclaim ihattconstruction; it was not borne out by the debate nor by the terms of the resolution proposed by the right hon. ..gentlernan. The objections to the motion appeared to turn more upon its prospective character and the indirect manner in which it imdicated its objects than upon any opinions Iendjing to give the sanction of the House to estimates
which it had had no means of examining. Well, letus ome to a consideration of the subject immediately before . x. I propose that the duty on tea shall remain at the point at hic itis ow ixe-is Sd pe lb,and, as at present advisd, I shall, If theHouse Pheoruld adopt my ropoal,

When my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer made his statement the other night he showed us a surplua of 890,001.; but 'since that period he bas modified his pro-: posal with regard to tea in such a manner as to z'educe his
surplus to about 500,0001. Thus, there is a nomilial aurplUs' of 600,0001. b but what has my right hon, friend got to proside for? h1e has not yet provided one fartbing for the expenses of the hostilities in China, nor for the eXPinses
of the Persian war after the 5th of April next. He has' proposed a vote for the expenses of the Persian war up to the 6th of April next; but my firm belief is that that voto will
be found far below the actual amount of expenditure incur-A red. But, putting that on one side for a moment, you have a surplus of 500,0001., and on the other side you have to
meet the total expense of aChinese war and the partial: expense of a Persian war during the next financial year. There will be no question of a surplus if the plan of my right hon friend be adopted; but, even if there were, I nay it is the daty of the House of Commons not to be bound to accept every proposal of the Government as to particular taxes, simply because the plan of the Government as it stands does not show a satisfactory relation between income and expenditure. Of me the Government shall not have to complain for any undue anxiety to take away their ways and means. I emphatically concur in what fell from the hon. member for Huntingdon, that it is the first duty of the House of Commons, under'all circumstances and at all times, as far as human foresight can go, to maintain a surp)lus income, and I hope that if the Ilouse will be dispo,ed to take some measures as to the expenditure, we shall prevent that great evil which I now see coming-a deficiency in the revenue of the present year. Upon the statement of the Chancellor of the E3xchequer there is now no surplus-for the small amount he mentioned would be swallowed up in the expenses of the two wars I have alluded to, to say nothing of other matters, such asthat referred to the other night by my right hon. friend the member for Carlisle (Sir J. Graham)-vnz., the considerable sum likely to be required for the redemption of the Sound Dues, should the Government bind themselves by anytreaty upon that subject. I only wish to show that really thereis no surplus, according to the plans of Her Majesty Government. If those proposals be adopted there will be an in. crease in the duties levied upon ea and sugar after the 5th of April next, and I wlfI now try that plan by its merits. My right hon. friend has reduced very much the scope of his proposal. Originally it was his intention to levy instead of the present duty of Is. 9d. upon tea, a duty of Is. 7d. lUpon this my noble friend the member for the city of London proposed to levy Is. 4d., and I, not aspiring to the merit of originality, was content td adopt the present law by which after the 5th of April next Is. 3d. per lb. would be charged upon tea. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, being determined to be original, abandoning the 9d. and the 7d., rejecting alike the 4d. and the 3d., alights upon Is. 5d. as the amount to be charged. ("Hear," and a laugh.) We have now the simple question between the present law which fixes the tea duty at Is. 3d. per lb. and the proposal of the right hon. gentleman to increase that duty to Is. 5d. I will not repeat what I stated on a former evening of the immense importance, the enormous and unmixed benefits to the country generally that have accrued from the great reduction in indirect taxation. I ata quite sure these facts have impressed themselves upon the mind of the Hrouse, and that will be especially the case when dealing with a subject lke tea, with which no painful recollections of former transactions are connected. The reduction of the tea duty was proposed by the right hon. gentleman opposite, who had the honour of first suggestin it as the representative of Lord Derby's Government. Uhat Government fell upon a question of finance, hut those who succeeded to power adopted the proposal of the right hon. gentleman, and it was adopted by the House with only insignificant variations. It had, therefore, the most solemn and unanimous sanction of the Commons House of Parliament that could be given. Now I ask for what great boon or benefit is it that the Government invite us to take the first step in the reversal of this beneficial process, and afterwards I will ask for what reason? It is to obtain a sum which, as regards the article of tea, does not exceed more than 370,0001., and something not very different from the samne sum on sugar. That is tho whole which my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer vill gain for the present year by interfering with the existing law, and by setting what I must be permitted to call the nmost pernicious precedent of an act of retrogression in policy with respect to those great articles of consumption. (Bear, hear.) Now, I first submit that that is a most inadequate object to be gained for such a purpose. (Hear, hear.) The sum is trifling-and insignificant in itself, and does not in the least degree justily on account of its importance as a matter of ways and means any step whish is questionable on higher and broader grounds. (Rear, hear.) The object being, as a financial object, extremely insignificant, what are the other circumstances in the case? I have been told by the Secretary to the Treasury that I myself am a great offender in this matter of the tea duties, because I proposed an increase of those duties during the war. On .ugar I did, but not on tea, and so deeply were the Government to which I belonged convinced of the evil of interfering with the descending scale of tea duties that in 1854, when we ob. tained power to apply 12,000,0001. taxes to defray the expenditure of the war, we positively did not interfere with that descending scale. When we then doubled the income. tax and increased the malt and sugar duties we,with the full consent of Parliament, left the descent of the tea duties to take its full effect. Such was the sentiment we all entertained with respect to the mischief of interfering- with the prospective fall of the tea duties. In 1855 the necessity was pressing, aud it had become absolutely necessary to resort to loans; but, while resorting to loans, welikewiso thought it ringt to obtain an increase of mean from taxation, and then with great reluctance, we arrested the next fall of the tea duties, but did not increase their amount. It was reserved to my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and not to the Government of Lord Aberdeen, to be the first to increase the tea duties. We did increase the sugar duties under great -presure, and the House also increased the tea duties, but entirely and exclusively as war duties. Wo granted the increased duties for a certain period, which was defined carefully in an Act of Parliament, and that period, by the terms of tho Act, will expire on the 5th of April. The question now to consider is whether the House will carry on in a time of peace those war duties on tea and sugar? (Hear, hear;) It is useless to say that we are not increasing the tea duties, but only suspending the decline, It does not signify what name you use, it is really a tax. You suspend the decline this year, another person may suspend it the next year, and a third may suspend it the year after that. Do not, therefore, perplex and involve the question in darkness by using unmeaning words. The Parliament duriDg the war granted those duties until the 5th of April next, and I only ask you to leave them as the Parliament during the war left them. What is the consequence of the course taken with respect to the tea duties? Why, in the first place, a distinct promise was given to the parties engaged in the trade; and I confess that I think it a most serious evil that that promise chould be broken. (Hear, hear.) It is all very well to come down to the House and say that, whether you grant a remission of the tea duty or
not, no loss will fall on the dealer. I think nothing could l be more harsh-I will not say dishonest-than such a state. ment. In the next place, nothing is more impolitic than to grudge to the trader the profit he derives from the remission of duty. The first effect of all remissions of duty is to throw profit into the pockets of the trader, and that pro. cess has this beneficial eflect, that it excites the enterprise of the dealer and leads to an augmentation of the supply. I think that, after the Act of 1855, those who were engaged In the China trade were perfectly entitled to consider that, unless in the event of a great stress and pressure, they were entitled to have their expectation of a reduction of the tea duties, as they stood under that Act, realized. I will not talk of a compact, because I wish to avoid verbal disputes, but I put it to the House whether there was not a fair right to expect, in the event of the cessation of the war, a decline of the tea duties as fixed by the Act of 1855? Much has been said against the expediency of prospective legislation; and now a different philosophy has come into play, and -we are told that the only proper thing to do is to vote taes for 12 mGonths, just as we grant supplies 12 months. As the tide seems to be running against prospective leglslation, I shall not be altogether wrong in saying something about the nature of the promise on this subject; aud, secondly, about the effects, as regards the article of tea, of prospective legislation. I read in a public statement, frec to be seen by all the world, a passage in which the Chancellor of the Exchequer is represented as having stated to a deputatioii on the.23d of January, ten days before the opening of Parliament, that the war taxes on tea and sugar would terminate on the 5th of April by law. Well, I confess if those words, or any eqmvalent words, were used by the right hon. gentleman, I think it is a curious fact for the House of Commons to consider, be. cause there is not a doubt, if such words were used, that the gentlemen who lheard them, being engaged in the trade, would immediately and unhesitatingly proceed to arrange their communications with China, and to conduct their operations in conformity with, and ii implicit reliance mn, those w~ords. (Hear, hear.) I think, then, it is a most serious objection to the proposal of the Chancellor of the Excheq,uer that it disappointed the expectations reasonably entertilned by the deaera on account of words usdbya hlinister of State. (Hear, hear.) So much for the promise.
Now, let me sy a few words about prospective legislation; because, undoubtedly, if that be bad the legislation. now proposed must be good; because the Chancellor of the * Exchequer proposes to grant the duty on tea for 12 months
only, and to let the matter afterwards take its chance. (The ight hon. gentleman here quoted certain figures to show that with prospective le'gislatonproviding a declining scale of tea duties there was -aconstantly extending consumption and increased operations in the trade, but that directly the declining scale was arrested in liko mranner was arrested the extension of the trade operations.) The consequenceof theprospectivelegislation of 1853 has been this, that you havenow got a state of things in this country which saves the people fron the chance of a famine in tea. You have now got 'a larger stock of tea by a great deal in the tountry than you ever bad before. There has heen no example of such a stock. (Hear,lhear.) It is to that'that my right hon. ftiend trusts, becatse he thinks that the tea-. dealers will have such large stocks on hand .that theY must sell,, whatever the duty me be, and that he will therefore be able to gain somethimg from themin that respec. But I bope that this House will not be led by any such narrow policytoexultinxtbe 'gains that are lobe gotoutofdealers hy a disappointonent of _tieL.expectation&sthat they have entertained. (Hear.)

such a nrte. Th* noble lord in the exercise of -that di,. tion had determined not to pres the-propostion, and he (Mr. Gretson) would therefore not -oppoee the imposition of a duty of Is. 5d.. which was to be continued only for a year. and would then boe ope to rvisio.Tergt o.gnl. man (Mr. Glatono) had calculated that the duty of Is. 3d. upon tea, which would have been imposed had the existing arrangement continued in force, would yield a revenue of t0000001. but if a duty of Is. 5d. were adopted it would afford au *aditional revenue of 550,0001. A duty of is. 5d. would amoukt to 115 per cent, upon the gross value of the presnt atoak of tea. The value of the stock was about 5.440%0001., and the duty amounted to nearly 6 000 0001. That duty was go excesgive that it ought not to be'long con. tinned. He was an avocate for the r action of the duty to Is., which would amuount on the aver ge to 100 per cent, upon the importing price, and as the consuptoion wag rapidly increasing an enormous revenue might be derived fronm this source. He hoped the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Gladstone) would not divide the conmittee; he (Mr. Gregson) could not support his amendment.
Mr. POLLARD.URQUHARtT agpreed with what had been saidaato the great advantages derived by the country from the reduction of the duties on tea and sugar - but, ais we were still fee the effects of the war in regafto expenditre he
h iwould be rash to make any sudden reduction of taxation; either in those or in any other articles, in the
hope that a corresponding reduction could be hereafter made in the expenditnr HIo would substitute direct for ndirect taxation as far as he found it practicable, but be id not beliee the trading and commercial olasses woould bear heaver direct taxation than we now had, and there. fore he thought the Government had exercised a wise discretion in the course which they proposed to take. (Hear,
Mr. 31. GIBSON had been somewhat perplexed, after the speeches they had heard, to know what it was they were asked to vote for. He understood the proposition of the Government to be this-that, whereas the present law said that from and after the 5th of April the duty on tea should be Is. 3d., they cropored that it should be Is. 5d. The hon. gentleman who ad just sat down said be was an enemy to andirect taxation, but, nevertheless, he would' vote with the Government for a great increase of indireci taxation. (Hear, hear.) He could not understand the difficulties which some gentlemen had as to the proposition before the House. It sunply amounted to this-that there was to be an increase in the duty on tea greatly above what it would be if the present law were let alone. (Hear.) It was to defray certain expenditure wbich the Government told them was in their opinion necessary, but on which the House had pronounced no opinion. (Hear.) Now, he believed that the estimntes mighbt be reduced to an aniount far greater than would ba obtained by adding 2d. to the tea duty. In these circumstances, how could they deliberately, at the end of a moribund Parliament, imnose an increase of the tea duty, and thus, as the nght Lon. gentleman the member for the University of Oxford had told them, reverse the whole fiscal system whicb of late years they had endeavoured to support X (Hear.) To increase the amount of tea duty in a time of peace was to establish a dangerous precedent. (Hear.) And why ws this to be done without an attempt to reduce their expendi. ture? Were they to impose taxes whether they were necessary or not - and how could they tell whether they were necessary tili the opinion of Parliament had been ascertained as to the amount of expenditure? (Hear.) He thought they should support the motion of the right hon. gentleman the member for the University of Oxford. Ho must decline to forestall the opinion of the country on this important question. It was not merely an addition of 2d. to the tea duty that they were to consider-the proposal involved an important commercial principle, and would be viewed in that light by the country. (Hear, bear.) If they to.,k advantage of a future Parliament by fastening on the country this increase of duty on tea, they would have great difficulty in givimg a satisfactory explanation of this conduct to their constituents. (A laugh.) Aye, a day of reckoning would -come. The noble lord at the head of the Government
told them they ought to have pleasure in going before their constituents. (A laugh. He (Mr. Gibson) would havethat piessure, and it would be very much increased if he could give a satisfactory account of his public conductz and show thatl his votes were consistent with sound principle, and given with a view to promote the welfare of the country. me earnestly hoped that those of his friends who had been prominent in the cause of free trade would not, when they knew nothing of our expenditure, be found ready to rivet on the country for the next year an increase of the te duty. (Hear.) There was an important change in the proposition of the Government. They proposed that the duty should be Is. 5d. for 1857-58, but they had lost sight of the shilling to which it was ultimately to have been reduoed. This was the worst proposition that had yet been made. There was a rate of 1s. in the old proposal.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER wished to observe that in regard to the year commencing the 5th of April next he proposed that the duty shonld not be Is. 3d, but Is. 5d. In respect to the suLbsequent year he left the present unaltered. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. GIBSON.-The right hon. gentleman meant to leave
the present law unaltered in regard to next year; but he 1 (Mr. Gibson) objected to any increase of duty in the present I year. He felt none of that compassion which they were told they ought to feel for Chancellors of the Exchequer. '(Hear, hear.) They never got anything out of a Chanoellor of the Exchequer except by want of comnassion. (A laugh.) Compassion to the Chancellor of the Exchequer was cruelty to the country. (Hear, hear.) On these grounds he wtould vote for the motion of theI riht hon. gentleman the member for the University of Oxford. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. MALINS thought there oould be no doubt that the 1 -4ehancellor of the ExchLequer was seeking to ipmpose an additional dty upozn the people. He did not believe, how. ever, that the difference between Is. 6d. and is. 3d. would be sppreciable by the consumers of tea. That was proved
y t e brge increase which had taken place in the consump-.tion since the imposition of the higherrates The pronosition
of the noble lor the member for the city, that the duty should be ls. 4d. for three years would have been acceptable to the trade; but he did not think that Is. 5d. was an nreasonable duty for one year. He was of opinion, at the same time, that the present Parliament was entitled to settle the duty for the next three years.
Ir. L. HEYWORTH was opposed to indirect taxation. He did not agree with the last seaker that a duty of 2d. would not make any appreciable difference to the consumer. It amounted to 500,000C. per annum, and he was not prepared to say that the labouring classes could afford to lose so large a sum. He agreed with the noble lord the member for the citythat additional taxes would make the peoplo sersible of the evils of war; but the duties on tea and sugar were paid mainly by the working classes, who were not directly represented in that House, and who had, therefore, little to do with the waging of wars. The right hon. gentleman the member for Huntingdon had said that if the direct taxes were maintained at their present rates capital would leave the country. He maintained, on the contrary, that capital, like water; always found its level; that it favoured those places where there were large profits; and that large profits were obtained by increasing the resources of the country, which could not be done in a more effectual way than by substituting direct for indirect taxation. He recommended the House to open the ports, to reduce the daties -on articles of consumption, and thus to do justice to the working classes. Looking upon all indirect taxation as fallacious, he should support the motion of the right hon. gentlemani.
Mr. MOFPFATT said, that the importers and dealers in tea bad been willing to accept the compromise afforded by the proposition of the noble lord the member for London, of Is. per pound, but that they bad heard with surprise and dismay the proposal which had been placed upon the table last night, which introduced an element of uncertainty into the duty, which was more detrimental even than the amount of the tax. It wasthepractice in the tea tradeto sell teaordinarly "dutr paid," andenormouscontractshadboen made upor the faith of the existing Acts of Parliament. That practice obtained throughout the whole of the united kingdom, and in all the large towns of the empire tea had been sold" duty paid." Theeffect of the Chancelor of the Exchequer's proposition would be to give a kind of premium to bad faith, and the amount which -was involved in these transactions was very great. Moreover, it made the supply for the ensuing year uncertain, because it was impoesible to say what the tax next year would be. The ChanceUor of the Exchequer inUmated that it would be Is. per lb., but if he meant that he ought to have stated it in the resolution, because hs present proposal gave no security whatever to importers. The only objection in the least degree feasible which he had heard to a reduction of the duties was that it would create a deficienoy in the revenue. If he thought that it would do so, he would not support the motion of the right lhon. gentleman h but believine that it was inthe power of the Government greatly to reduce the expenditure of the ,country he anticipated no danger from agreeing to the pro. position. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. HORSFALL said, that there was this difference beAween In. 4d. per lb., as was to have been proposed by the noble lord the memberfor London, and the proposition of the Government, that Is. 4d. would have satisfied the i;npoeters and dealers in tea, and that Is. 5d. would not. -(ear, hear.) He did not attach much importance to what
ad been called abcomp ct' between the (h,noellor of the Exchequer and the lIoulse, or to the statement made 12 months ago that the duty should now belas. 3d. per lb., or to letters received from the Mocretary to the Customs, or to statements of the Chancellor of the ExAchequer to deputationa n;upon the income-tax; but he 3id at.
tacih sob importance to an Act of Parliament. (EIar, leAr.) -The Act of Parliament to which he referred was an extraordinary one, in virtue of which -certain #iles were to be levied during the war; and the warhayigi rminated he thought that there was a compact j Wby ich.the House was pledged to reduce the duties in PsgpniA4.0 w-Ithe_ropeeal. o the -right hon. gentleman -te niemieorthe unversity of Oxford. He (Mr. Hors.
Ia),-however, wasin this difliculty, that wbere he thought Uhat the right hon. mnember for the UJniversity of Oxford was altogether right in prinp le, he had presented a petition from his constituents in favour of the rotion of which the noble lord the member for London had given notice, but W4not preaed, for ls. 4d. per lb., and, having now been toIb itre OChatmim of the, Est India and China Asoois:tin the mercbants of LIndon would be satisfied with ,~54rpetlI ., he really did not know how to vote, and he log>g8'sFint the most consistent thing for him to do l k lk out of the House previoUS to the division.
aald that, according to the settlement of i8W, ~b4i~~. of duties would have been at this moment -s.-.,,,x,,5.in the pound; duty on tea, Is. per lb., .- l.ttcz sugar, 10s. per cwt. The war unfortunately

It was proposed to reduce the ineomeiax from 16d. to 7d., but by the original acbeuse it would now stand at 5d. Then, again, as regarded the teaduty,j it was'proposed to reduce it fromn Is. 9d. to Is. 54., while by tlieoriginal plan it ought to

the sdditional taxe tught to iavg been Isirly4ppl$btioned between direct and indirect axation ;but, in hisopWion, te apportionment proposed ws neither fair nor equitable. For these reasons he thought that the resolution before the comiuittee ought not to be adopted unless the most urgent necessity for It could be ahown to exist. The whole amount which would be ganed by the proposal of the Chancellor of the Exchequer was only 500,Mo7O, and hefuUy expected that when the estimates came under the consideration of theHouseit uld be by no means impossible to reduce them by that. amount. Already, in consequence of the preesure which had been employed, they had been reduced by 1,000,0001., and perhaps a little more pressure would produce a still greater result. (Eear, hear.) And, still more, even if they could not be reduced to the extent of 5t0,000., it would be better in his opiniontoallowthatamnount of Exchequer-bonds to stand over, and not, as the resolution before the Housa would do, to infringe upon the principles of free trade. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. 3MUNrZ viewed the queston as one between direct and indirect taxation. He had taken some pains to ascertain the real boarings of the question, and had come to the conclusion that the amendment proposed by the right hon, gentleman would benefit the importer only, and not the general consumer. (Hear.) As regarded the income-tax, it was not correct to say that it was no hardship to the poor man, for, on the contrary, it in an indirect way affectd him very seriously. For his own part he was prepared to support the proposal of the Government.
Mr. NEWDEGATE was not inclined to vote for a deficienoy. As regarded the expenditure the House was quite in the dark with regard to it, and the only course which he could adopt was to trust to the statement of the Government who had seen the estimates, rather thin to that of the right hon. gentleman the member for the University of Oxford who had not seen them. Tho House was placed in the absurd position of being called upon to vote entirely in the dark. The presumption, however, was, that the Government could not make further reductions, and the Bouse was not in a position to enforce them because they had had no opportunity of examining the estimates. (Hear, hear.) He was bound, therefore, to acocpt the proposals of the Government, not because he approved them, but
because he was ,thout data upon whic to form a judg. ment. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. DISRAELI.-I think my hon. friend has not placed this question fairly before the committee, He has argued it as a question involving thereduc'ion of taxation. To my mind it is a question of a new tax. (Hear, hear.) Virtually we are called upon to decide whether we shall increase the taxation of the country, and not whether we shall reduce it. (Hear, hear.) Now the temper of the committee on this mubject proves how inconvenient it is during the last days of a Parliament to entertain questions of such moment and responsibility as the proposal of a now tax. Here you have the member for the commercial capital of the country, who has deeply considered this subject, who has listened to deputations, who particularly represents those most interested in the duty on toa, and who gives a notice, after due consideration of the coumse which he thinks it most advantageous for the committee to adopt. That proposition, however, afterhaving been so matarelyadopted, is hurriedly withdrawn because the noble lord (Lord Y, Russell) thinks there is not authority enough in the present House of Commons to deal with a question of this kind. I said at the beginning of the evening I thought it most unwise and impolitic that during the last days of our existence we should be entertaining the consideration not only of new taxes, but generally of the most important subject of direct or indirect taxation. The Chancellor of the Exchequer seemed at first to argue against that proposition. But what is the course takenby the Government? TheGovernment themselves came forward with (ories of "Divide " from the back Ministerial benches)--I have sat in this House 20 years, and I am interrupted by voices which I certainly think will not be heard in the next Parliament. (A laugh.) Do you think that sounds so imbecile as those (a laugh) will prevent me from expresdng my opinions and the opinions of those who sit behind me ? No, I say that the course pursued by the Government proves the justice of my position, because their original financial propositions extended over a period of three years, while now they have made them apply only to one year, because they felt that they could not offer such propodtions to the consideration of a House possessing now so short a tenure, Such a course is an admission of our diminished authority, and an admission that the policy which the noble lord at the head of the Giovernment recommended Her Majesty to follow, and the propriety of which I do not question-at least, I shall not lo so on this occasion-has a great effect upon the subjeet of 2ew taxation. I must now come to the consideration of 'his peculiar tax. I am told itis nothing. My hon. and earned friend the member for Wallingford (Mr. Malins) says, " It is only twopence. What is twopenee ? It is not felt.' Well, then if twopence is not felt, if Is. 5d. is not felt, vhy should not Is. 7d. next year be also unfelt? (Haer.) bty hon. and learned friend should understand that what Is ''only twopence" represents to the consumer 500,OW1. iterling (hear), and the addition of two or three twopenoes nay constitute an amount which may not only so severely felt by the consumer, but may have a most injurious effect on the trade and commerce of the country. (Hear, hear.) I certainly did think the House of Commons had ad sufficient experience no longer to consider that what may appear a slight amount Df taxation will in the aggregate produce no effect upon the uonsumer and upon our commerce. Butthen we are told that weoausthave this new tax, because we haveannounood to us in the part of the Mlinistry an expenditure which must be net by a certain amount of revenue. We are really to ,arry into effect new legislation opposed to the whole spirit of our previous legislation, which really strikes at the root f all those principles which we thought were establshed, and this inereased tax on tea is to be Imposed (oonVidering it now irrespective of all financial con. iderations) by a House which favours temperance, which wants to elevate the condition of the people, and which wishes to divert them from those habits of Lntoxication which we are assured are the great root of the moraldegradationofthopeople. (Hear.) Wearenowrtold that we muat vote this tax, ope to every sound prlnciple of political economy, opposed to every ound pnnciple Df political morality; and why? Because vehave it declared from the Treasury bench that a certain expenditure must be incurred, and a certaiu revenue must be furnished. But, Sir, we have not the sightest evidence as to the neessity of that expenditure. No proofs are before us (hear); and we have pursued a course which-never was pursued before in Parliament, and which has, in fact, broulght us into this dilemma. We have plaoed the cart before the horse. What is the reason we have gone into Committee of Ways and Means before going into Committeo of Suppl? 7 With surprise I heard the First Lord of the Admiralty say the other evening that I had recommended this course, At the time, from my recollection only of what had passed, I offeredarespeotfal eontridiction to the right hon. gentleman, and on examining subsequently the records of the debate I find that I not only did not sanction, but spoke in this very placesagainst, the propostion, receiving n answerfromth
right hon, member for Oxford (Mr. Cardwell), who offered a precedent, which, by the way, did not apply mn favour of the Government policy. On my own behalf, and on that of other g,entlemen who sit on this aide of the HIouse, I prot.est against any attempt to fasten the responsibility of this maladroit oourse upon us. It is the course of the Government, and because they have pursued that course, totally opposed as it is totbheusual Parliamentary mode of proceeding, it Is not for them to rise and say,-" We call upon you, without deliberation, and under circumstances in which It is impossible gravely to consider this question-during thelast days of an expiring Parliament-to assent to new taxes, direct and Indirect, of a very grievous kind, and to the amount of millions." ("Divide P") No ; I won't divide. (Laughter.) What would havo been the course of the House if we had gone into Committee of SupPly? We xhould have had the estimates before us, we should have had an analysis of those estimates-a criticism upon the expenditure, and motions for a reduction of that expenditure. Then we should have had a China debate; the same result would have folowed as ensued on Tuesday, the same counsel would have been given to the Sovereign, and Parliament would have been dissolved. But then you could not have come forward and said that thec oredit of the country required we should vote in the dark for new taxes. You would have made the best arrangement you could; you would have said, "The new Farliament shall assemble as early as possible," aud the Chancellor of the Exchequer would then come forward and make his proposals before an atselbly w^hich could deliberato upon the subject of ta:xation with the greata advantage to the eountry, and without being pressed for time, while the public would givesa cordia,l and synmpathetic approva of their decision upon the subject. WYe should have had the financial statement in May. U'hy can we tot have the financial statement in Mday? (HeJr.) Why should we be called upon, without the slightest knowoledge of what the wants o *the, country are, to vote new taxeo? I am ol

Granted. But sbow us what those elaims are, and whet are those calses of expenditure ? (Hear.) Let u have before us soeie evidence tbat the <emans upon the Ex,chequer really requiro these mew sicrifices from our cotstituents. (HIear, ear.). If, however, thso acrifie were
to be made, a taz on tea would be the last I should su ort. I believe it to be 9pposed to sound policr-I belev it it
will reasrict our commuerce and diminish the ofori of
our people. (Hear, hear.} Some words have Os,sed e.tween the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Gl a ;one) aud the Cbancellor of the Bxcheqxeras to w. etb- tbhi ia a retrograde movement. Now, I am sure the right ,hon. gentleman is the last man who would deal lightly and carelessly with a question of this sort, but if I nuAst ive an impartial and well-considered opinion on-bis poli, and if you ask me whother I regard it a a retrograde one, and whether the consequences of assentinz to a resolution of this kind will be such as materially to change the commerdal sytem of this country as far as financ is concerned. I say I sncerely believe that it is a reactipnary policy. We have seen the effects of it in the House te-night. Hon. members sy that the question is only one of 2d., without rflecting tbat that 2d. Involves in the aggregate an increae of half a million of taxation.

(Cheers.)
Mr. GLADSTONE.-My right hon. friend the Chaneellor of the Exchequer has not left the question in a position per. fectly cloar. He still contends that he is going to maike a reduction of taxes (hear, hear), and he complains that Ihold that a reduction which is a less reduction than a greater reduction is no reduction at all. (Laughter.) That was the expression of the Chaneellor of the Exchequer earlier In the debate, and I reproduce it in a fuller commnittee for the edification of hon. members (A laugh.) I won't debate the question with my right hon. friend whether in that sentence he has correctly defined the position I take, because it is a definition which requires a considerable effort of mind to follow (a laugh), but I tell him that his reduction is no reduction at' all if he Sa he is giving a reduction of duty from Is. 9d. to IJ. 5d 'sar he is not gin such a reduction; that the law has given it already, an that he is no more the giver of it than he is the jiver of Magna Charta. (Cheers and laughter.) But it is said you ought not to leave the whole burden on direct taxation. It is admitted that the war has added something to the burdens of the country, and you are told that you ought to give a portion of that to direct taxation and a portion to indirect taxation. Why, Sir, my right hon. fnend is going to add 2,000,0001. for one year, and he proposed to add 2, 0001.for three yeasrto the direct taxation of the country. The Govemrnent has also already, in the shape of the duty on spirits, added a large sum to the indirect taxation of the country, and therefore don't tell me it is necessary to increase taxation on teaand sugar, or to Impose taxes which in tbeir very nature must be o objectionable to tho great mass of the popultion. (Hear, hear.)
Lord J. RUSSELL-I think it is desirtble that my right hon. friend the ChanceUor of the Exchequer should give some further explanation on a point of some importance. I refer to his answer in regard to the tax for the next year, after the expiration of the tax which he now proposes. I understood him to say he did not mean to Interfere with the operation of the law, but that in April, 158, the tax should be reduced to Is. That may be understood in two ways. The one may be in the sense in Which he fairly stated it to a deputation which recently waited upon him-namely, that orn the 5th of April next by law the tax would be reduced to Is. 3d. That is one way; but then he himself may come forward at some other time, and propose to reduce the tax which he now fixes at Is. Ed. to Is. 3d., or Is. 2d., or any other sum. (Hear, hear.) That would not be a very fair thing to persons engaged in the tea-trade because, if they cannot make prepaations for a large supply for next yea,. theyF wilbetoagreatdegreeprejuadiced as will also the great bo'y of consumers. Ii he means that, so far as he is con. cerned, the tax, after the expiration of the year ending the 5th of April, 1858, shall be reduced to is., it would be satisfactory to have a statement to that effect from my right hmen.friend. (ERear, hear.)
The CEANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.-I cannot give such au assmrance as that; and I can only say that, if I shall have the honour of holding my present office when another Parliament is assembled, I shall feel myself at liberty to submit to the next Parliament a proposition for increasing the duty on tea beyond the amount of Is. I express no opinion s to the policy of altering the law. I wish merely to refer to a letter mentioned in the course of the debate as having been written by the Commissioners of Customs to Mr. Sampson, the well-known writer of the city article in 2We Vme. That gentleman addressed a communication to the commissioners inquiring whLat would be the rate of duty under the existing law after the 5th of April. The Commissioners of Customs, without referring to the Treasury, replied that it would be according to the law then in force. If the commissioners had referrel to the Treasury they would have been told that that would be a proper answer to give to such an inquiry. It is the duty of the Finance Minister not to make premature communications to the publie in respect to contemplated changes in the revenue, for nothing is so much complained of as when persons are in a position to conjec. ture what course the Government of the day is likely to take in reference to commodities in which they deal, and when such persons are enabled, in consequence, to take articles out of bond. I can only say, if, the day before I had to open a Budget in my capacity of Chancellor of the Exchequer to this House, I were asked what would be the amount of duty upon a particular article after a given time, I should reply that that would depend upon the decision of Parliament, for no executive Government can act on any other principle. With respect to an observation which fell from my right hon. friend the member for the University of Oxford, it seems to me that his very acute mind must have been refreshed by the reeent study of certain logical puziles printed at the end of a work on logic, which both he and I were in the habit of reading when we were members of the University of Oxford. (A laugh.) le ertainly Appears to me to have perplexed avery aimple subject by a very unnecesary amouont of refinement. r il restate what Ib ave already said on the point in question. I did not take any credit for making a reduction to the public. I merely deieribed what wrould be the effect if the resolutionI
prooed wreagreed to by Parliament. What
waatd s this, that if a duty wrhich is now Is. 9d. a pound were fixed at ls. od. it would be a reduction, although it would not be so pteat as if it eree fixed at is. 3d. (Laughter.) Thnat is a plamn statement of fact. The duty at preSent IS ls. 9Id. a-pound. I propose a resolution under which, i' it receive the force of lawr, the duty will be 8s. d.i My right hon. friend may refine on the subiect as much as he pleases; but, nbvertbeless, a trader wvho has to ?ay the duty will come to the conclusion that that duty is a reduced duty. (A laugh.) Uinquestionably the dluty wrill not be so much reduced as it would be if it were reduced to ls. 3d.; and I still maintain that I wras right, in describing the objection of my ri ht hon. friend to my proposition, when I stated that he held that a reduction w hich is a less reduction than a greater reduction is no reduaction at all. (" Hear, hear,> and a laugh.)
Mr. HE1NL;EY said he hada *very great objection to leave the revenue in a deficiency, and he wras not sure there wrould be a sufficient balafice left over the expenditure if the House agree to the hand-over-head resolution before thte com-
MSr. FITZROY inquired whether the ri'ht hon. gentle. mlan the member for the UJniversity of Ox?ord wishd his amendment to be put separately?I
Mlr. GL-ADSTONfE replEod that his object was to maintain the existing lawr, and ho would propose a resolution to that effect if t should be deemed the most Ireua course.
The CH[ANCELL-OR of the EXCHEQUER sugested that the right bon, gentleman's object wo0uld be attained by simlply negativing htiS (the Chancellor of Excheqe's)
Kir. GLADSTONE did not concur in that view, as a simple negative to the resolution would leave it open to any other hon. member to propose another amendment.
The question was then put upon 31r. Gladstone's amenld. ment, substtituting ls.3d. per lb. for Is. 5d. prlb. in the original resolution, wherenponthe committee dvided, when there appeared:-

"Big Ben" Of Westminster.
cc BIG BB' OF WESTMrYSTBR.
Yesterday evening Mr. E. B. Denison delivered a lecture at the theatre of the Royal Institution on the qualities and capabilities of bells in general, and that of Big Ben in par. ticular. Every part of the theatre was conopletelycrowded when Sir Charles Fe)lowes took the chair at 9 o'clock. Behind the speaker wore hung a number of diagrams and analytical tables of tho compositiens of the principal bells in Europe, to which he referred in order to explain the more technical portiou of his address. After a brief preface, in which heremarked that hewas not going to givethemahi3tory of bells, with which they wero very likely quite as wel acs quaintedas himself, nortoenterintothequestion of themusi. cal tone of bells, for he was no musician, he went on to say that with regard to the latter point most people seemed more surprised at his having made the Westminster bell the tone he wanted than at a bell of such a ire being made at aIL His having got the tone E was, however, most easily accounted for. For instnce if a belwa made of 30inebes diameter, and it had a certan tone, every bellfounder knew at once that a bel of 60 inches would be a tone lower, so that it was perfectly easy and certain when they had one bell to know what the tone of another so much smaller or larger would be, provided the shape aad relative thickness of both were alike. The big bell was originally intended to have been E flat, its weight 14 tons, and its thickness 9 inches; but by some aocddent its weight was raised to 16 tons, and its thickness to 9 inches ith; which raised the note from E flat to E. 'When the bell wa first thought of Professor Wheatstone, Mr. Taylor, and himself were slected to a4y what kind of bell was to be made; and though at first sight that question might appear an eas one to solve, it was, in truth, most dilficult. The bdlfounders of England, from one cause oranother, were not willing toundertake the task,unlessthey were furnishedwith a design and full instructions as to what it was to be, and that was the difficulty which at last led him to become its designer. After referring to the popular prejudice whicht existed in favour of the sonorous tones prodnued by bells oF hemispherical shape, but which he shoowed werre poor, meagre, and deficient in tone when heard at a little distance, 3r. Denison said that his two colleagues And himelf at lst came to the unanimous conclusion that marly allthe hells of modern fabric wrer failures, and that to imit.te them would be to do wrong wilfully. 'The difference between the Westminster bell and other bells was that it was fatter along the outside of the sound bow, that it was not cut away at the lip, as in the ese of the Paris bell but swepton in a continuouS curve, leng-waied bells, or those which were almost straight in the side, were inferior to those which were hollow. If a line was drawn from the top of the Westminster bell to its oater edge, the space between such a line and its side wotldbe1G12thof thebel;'x diameter; while in the other bells, esplly
that of Paris, it was not a 14th. Westminster in heigt was only 2-4ds of its diameter, while the height of the bell of Paris was 5-F6ths. Such differences, slight aS they seemed to persons not aequainted with the subject, were realy all mportant. Great Tom of Oxford 0 r Deni60n characterized as one of the worst bell ia existence, while the great bell of Exeter was A decent bell if it only had a decent clapper. (Laughter.) Tiere was one, bell in the world that was almost perfectly similar to tho Westminster bell, and that was the great bell of Moscow. That was A most favourable coincidence, for a bell of sueb a size as thit at Moscow would never have been cast by a, nation so well acquainted with the principles of bellbmaldke if it bad not been perfectly correct in form. The weight o the Moscow bell was reported to be 193 tons, but he was certain, from the Accounts he bad heard of it, that it mist at least weigh 250 tons, and that another fne Russian be*, which was said to weigh 80 tons, in reality weighed 120, m. that he generallyooncludedthat the Rusian belli wererealy heavier than they were stated to be. The thickness of the bell of Westminster was just 1-12th of its diameter atthe sound-bow. People often ordered bels of only 1-15th diameter, which took less copper And saved their silvelabghter); but, as at Westminster they were not so presse or sver, they determined to have the bell the right thinm. With regard to the thin part of the bell, or its waist, t was curious that beUs when struck there sounded a isnch higher note than when struck at the sound-bow, and this he and his colleagues at first thought was something to bc remedied; but after some experiments they wsre compeUed to give up the hobby, and to admi* that bells should give forth a higher note when atrck at the waist than when struck at the thick _wrt. This great bell, when struck tt the waist, gave a tonothree notes higher than when struck At the thickest. Astothe composition of bells, said Ir. Denison (striking bellsof the different metals as he proceeded, in ilustration of his remarks), those made of steel pve a bard sounA; with a rixtre of iron nd antimony thesound was bett. Iron and tin was better than antimony; one of phosgpos and copper made an average good tone. Amixture ofta sninum and copper was a failure; but the best of all was tfe eommon bell of copper and tin. Many people beliaved that a bell of pure silver would have a fine tone. By accident he heard of a clergyman who, to make sure of havng a good bell with silver in it, actually came an* put his plate into the melting pot himself. Now, he thought tht a gentleman who had sacificed so much would know all about the tone of silver aa a composition with other metals for bels, so be ( Mr. Denison) wrote to him for information. The answer he got from the clergyman was that it was some time since he had made the experiment and behed forptten all about its results. (Laughter.) Well, be thought if te ot such an nawser as that at the spense of al the poorman'sspoons and forks that he (3r. Denison) would have nothing to do with silver in his big hell. The great hell of Rouen was called a silver bel, but when melted and part analysed it wa found to contain no trace of silver whatever, though it had an extra quantity of tin. (Aughter.) In fact, silver wras never used in th. composition of any bell that be had known or heard of. The mixture was copper and tin, the general proportion being four of copper to one of tin; and, though that was not gaib treting tin fairly, hel-founders liked tho Inixtve, tor the bell was softer and easier to tone, It wa, however, a most singlar thing, but many experments proved that the copper got in those days would not bear such a propor tion of tin mixed with it asthe old eopperh done The composition used in tbe Westminster bell was 2 of oopper to 7 of tin, or copper 7586, tin 2- 14, which was about the very best proportion in which they could be used for bells. Its extraordinary specific gravity wras another proof of the zoodness of the comosition. The specific gravity of York bell was 876, ot linolhn S78, And the bigheet figare allowed by the alloys of copper and tin alone was 8.87; tha. of a piece of Westminster bell taken from the bottom was no les than 894. The specific gravity of the Doncaster bells recat in l835 was only 7.8, but. e bell ere a bIad abadcouldbhe. r. Denison then prooeeded to explAin the process of caing the bell of Westminster, whch was done on an improved principle by Mess Warner,to whom lbe paid. a high complement for the care and enersy beetowed upon &al the arrangements.- The whole of the 16 tons of metal were run into the menu
in lss than Sve minutes-a fact to which Mr. Depison Xminly attribuethe beautcla1nesofhe athells tone. He Dextbriear iDeted themianner in ich itis intended to hangthe bell to an iron beam by mns of powerful screws and hands passing undYer a metal collar on the top of the hell formed mn the casting for that purpose. H. was quite against the Sollmon method of supporting by iron ioops or by the bolt. which secured the ulapper. The lecture then concluded amnid mnuch applause,

InA the Hou"e of Conismons, on the motion for adjournment until Monday,
Mr. LXYAlx ObberVed, with referenoe to an anwer prerioualy given by Mr. V. &Mrr, that the House had hitherto d no knowledge whatever of the causes of tho War with Persia, and that it had a righst, beforo it separted, to some information respectin,g tho history of the war, bt having theo pYpers, or a selection of them, laid before the
Mr. V. SrmTH considcred that it was notdetirsble that tho House should depart from the ditcretion it had hitherto exercised, and force a discusion on a mtter still pending.
Sir H. WILLOwuBY objected to a war of thie
kind being entered upon without the previous ssc.. tion of the Home Government.
Mrr. GLADSroxr was not satisfied with what kad fallen from Mr. V. SMNTH, the upshot of which was that awar would have been entered into without the consent of Parliament; that when Parliament met negotiations wero commenced, which could be assigned as a reason for not inquiring into the cause of the wr ; and when papers were asked for it was said that their production would interfere withtho negotiations. According to this the representatives of the people wonld have no opportunity of pronouncing an opinion upon the war, and the conduct of the Government in relation to it, until the meeting of the now Parliament.
Mfr. EvELxY called attention to the eonduct of the Admiralty in reference to the Arctic vessel, the Resolute.
Explanations were given by Sir C. WooD.
M£r. Scorr called attention to the necemsity of taking measures to obtain gnano from the.habian Islands on ternLS more modterate than those lately concluded by the Government, and to scre its importation fronm those islandto this country.
Ir. LA?ouOREnR repeated the explanations he had gien upon a forner occasion, observingthat the principles upon which the Government had acted iu this matter had been those which had been adopted by successive Adminiltrations, and that their attention was directed to the secu-ng a supp y of guano to this country.
:Nfr. HENLEY called attention to the " Abstract of tho Returns of Vrecks and Casualties" lately presented to Parliament, upon which subject a few remarks were made by Mxr. Losz and Mr. CARDWELL.
Lord NsAS inquired whether any arrangement had been completed for the improvement of the communication between this country and Ireland t
Mr. WrLSoN explained the causes of the delay, and the present state of the arrangement.
Sir F. KELLY inquired whether the Government intended to allowr the Hongkong Ordinance of 1855 to remain in force ?
Lord PALmRSON replied that he was not aware of any intention to repeal it.
The motion for adjournment was agreed to.
On the order for going into a Committee of Ways and Means,
MIr. DsALi said, he had no wish to disturb the balanco between direct and indirect taxation, and, although he had been of opinion that by an economy of expenditure any material addition to the taxation might be avoided, he had been prepamd to give every assistance to the Government consistent with the settlement of 183, which he considered a compact. But the state of things, he said, was now altered. Lord PAmmrSsroN had stated the intention of the Government to appeal to the people. But, in that case, in what circumstances did the House find itself? How eouldammoribund House,which could not bind a new House upon the subject of war, bind it in respect to taxation i A new Bodget might be intrcdueed in Mlay, and it would be much better, in his oPiniGP, forthe new House of Cornanoms to deal with the subject of taxation. He hoped, therefore, that the llouse would well consider before it consented to grant newr taxes, and he,should support the motio0 of Mr. GL&DSTONE for not increasing (or suspending the decline of) the duties rpon tea aAd sugar.
The CH*AsPLiLoir of the ExcImEQursai4, it would be competent to-the newr House of Commons to a:ter the rte of idties he proposed, but ie was sneceary to deal with' the snbet of taxation fire the intervaE between the end of the fiuancial year ad the commencement OF the legislative actiox of the newParliament.
Mr. T. BArznssaid, he should oppese the motion of hMr. GDADSToNE, because it seemed to himn that, in the presenb teniper of the House, s- egard the expenditure, it wras a very hazardouo experiment. He should. therefora, support the t&xes as proposed by the C rs esnea of the ExcuHEQUZ3.
Sir H. W iMcrory considered that ParLiamenbt was bound to' take, off the whole of the war taxes, and, if there should prove to be a defiesency, to look out for other- objeda of taxation.
The Houswtbet went into committei, when
The CMnsscanwn of the ExcmrEQun5 recapitulated tho principles. of his financial policy, veiterating and. defending manyof the views upon wich his Budget; was founded,aud, aSating his reaaonsforaltering the proposed teQ duty. He observed, infhecourse-of his speech, that, judging from the present, and making due allowance for temporary inbtoruptions, there, never was in .erhistory any momGet at which these was less ground for alarm as to- ties poesibility oF raising an Aequate revenue from axation without a serious.pr-ese upon the spriap of the national industry. . mnoved a resolution that the duty oen tea shoui* be, after the 5th of April, 1857, to the 5th of April, 1858, ls. 6d. per 1b.
Mr. GIAWroNX, in rnovingi by way of amendment, that the duty be, after the 6th of April, 1857, h. 3d. per lb., and after the 5th of Apra, I5S, I. per lb., repeated tbe objection he had befor. wged to the OHACNcLLoiE of the Excnzcjum's financiol scheme whicb he insi3ted, was adverse to thepnciples o?the last 1 years. He contended that his scheme would go tothe country with a defitiency of ways and means, unless the expenditure wreO reduced. The CHANCLLOR of the EIcbsEQUxR had speculated upon a surplus revenue of 800,000l.; but since then, the alteration in the propowed tea duties (from is. 7d. to Is. 5d.) would reduce the nominal surplus by about 500,0001.; but he had not provided for the expenses of the hostilities *ith China, or those of the Persian war, after the 6th of April, and these, with other items, would leave no siurplus income. Nevertheiess, he maintained tbat the war duties onght not, contrary to stipulation, to be continued in time of peace; and he condemned, besides, the manner in which the tea trade had been dealt with in relation to tho war duties. If the House agreed, at a time when there was a nominal surplus, to impose thesa additional taxes upon tea and sugar, it would afford, he said, a fatal precedent. The rigid maintenabea of pledges given by Parliament was of the utmost possible importance.
TheCHAIcXLLOROf the ExcnzQu3n said, although he had litened to Wr. GLADSTON'ZS speech, lie could not understand its drift and policy, and if he had been called upon to prepare a Budget upon the principles recommended by Mr. GLADsnoNz he should be ptterly at a loss how to set about it.
nie nha represented the Budget unfairly as one. of incresed taxation; that a less reduction than a greater was no reduction at all; but a reduction of the duty on tea from it. 9d. to is. 5d., instead of to is. 3d., although, a lesu reduction, was .till.a reductEon, and not an increase of the duty. Sir G, Lxws then reviewed and replied to th, other rittions of MIr. GLAnssro2'se speech.
Lord J. RUSSELL vindicasted the opinion he had ezprsed uPOn the Budget, and said he hadl thought the proposal for arrestintg the fall of the wst duties -wohether thi5 a termed a redacotion or au aug. reentation of duty,-was a fair proposal. Tue only differenee betwreen him and the -CHAScLLOR of the liXcnusQii being nowr only ld. per lb. (Lord Jomrhaving given notice of an amendment to fis the duty on teb in 1857 and the two succeeding yeaiz
at 1s 4di), he would not divide th commithqQ aginst the motion, and he should rwt soppork y a2xtendrmtent of Mir. GLAroa-r.
MrE. Riio complained of the evijtXoinio r ,g the tampering wvith d.uties, and insisted l!fi4 t? r hbad been a eontract writh reference to the tw i)e

The debate then scquired the desultory character of an ordinary discussion in a committee.
C)pon a-divixion Mr. GLAD6ron'S amendment, 'hat the duty after the 5th of April, 1857, shall be I. 3d. per lb., was negativeaby 187 to 125.
The original resolution, fixing the duty at Is. 5d., was then agreed to.
Other resolutions, moved by the C IXCELLOR of the ExcHEquE1, fixing the duties upon sugar and certain other Customable article3, were likewise 4greed to.
The Norfolk Isdand (Ecclesiastical Government) ;Bi was withdrawn.
The Industrial Schools Bill p.ssed through Com-
mittee pro formd.
The House, after some further business, adjourned, at 20 minutes to 12 o'clock, until Bionday.
We are threatened with a plague of Chancellors
We are threatened with a plague of Chancellors 'of the Exchequer. They remind one of those streets in which every other door is a doctor's, and 'the wonder is where they can all find their patients. 'The supply of finance is out of aU proportion to -the demand. We know not how it is that the department of figures should be so attractive, and 'that aU the arts and sciences, rhetoric, ethics and poetics, all the virtues, aU the Graces, aU the Muses, -our greatest names, our noblest traditions, and our most prodigious platitudes should have taken refuge in the single department of Arithmetic. Every-body now aspires to the Public Accounts, and that from the purest love of double entry, casting --up, checking, balancing, and bringing forwards. Nlo matter howv simple the material, or how smaU 'the scope. As the barest bone will collect -the whole canine population of the village, you cannot pick a tax so clean but a dozen financiers will fight over-what is left. Rusum de-scribes TuRNa as running a tournament of *colours with his rivals in the Academy, and the results were certainly brilliant ; but we cannot say as much for the tournament of figures now run .,every night in HEB MAJEstYTs lists at St. Stephen's. Here is a Duty on Tea, which .at this moment stands at Is. 9d. a-pound, and by an Act passed before the late war would fall in April to Is. 3d., and the question i.s what change shall be made, if any, in consequence of the two great events that have happened meantime,-the - commencement and the cessation of theRussian war. Here is a margin of sixpence, and there was not a greater battle fought in the five-and-twenty yards of Thermopy]e than was fought last night in the four-and-twenty farthings between the two figures we have mentioned. The battle raged to and fro, and the result has been obtained after a series of oscillations. The present duty is Is. 9d.; according to Mr. GLADsToNEs old Budget, it would fall next April to Is. 3d. ; so he and Mr. DisRAELi took their stand last night on this mysterious figure. Lord J. RussELL, onthe other hand, saw imnportant 'easons for Is. 4d. In consequence of the division on the Chinese affairs and the approaching dissolution, the CHANCELLoR of the ExcHEQuEn had given up his prospective Budget and confined his attention to the next year. He had therefore modified his proposition for this year, -changing it to Is. 5d. Here, then, are the oscil*lations complete :-Is. 9d., Is. 3d., ls. 7d.,
Is. 4d., is. 5d., the last being the figure at v'hich the pendulum has finally rested.
The combatants in this trial of figures were, first, the actual CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER, then the two gentlemen who appear not yet to have settled which is to take the office or lead the House, in the event of an anti-Liberal Parliament in May; then come Lord JoHN RUSSELL and Mr. T. BARING, who think it necessary to take part in the discussion, without any strong feeling about it. It must be admitted the tone of the debate was not quite so feverish as it has been on some similar occasions, but the thermomete of faction stil stood at blood heat. The poet *onders how such minute little drudges as bees can feel such furious passions, and it must ever remain a mystery how financiers, who live in tne cold thin air of Arithmetic, can be -so passionate and vindictive. Certainly it is surprising that men who can have such noble sentiments towards Comnissioner YEH, who can sympathize with the weakness of his people, who cau take a charitable view of assassination, and estimate poisoning on Christian principles, should nevertheless see nothing short of Satanic agency in the preference of a seventeenrenny to a fifteenpenny dnty on tea. The course of human feeling, however, is rather volcanic; one cannot tell where it will flow; and it is rather hard to see the burning lava turn from the rocky ravine and the shingly seabeach to the fair valley and the fertile plain. But so it in in the British House of Commons. 'When we could wish our legislators 'to fire up a little more against the enemies of their country it does seem a waste of good fuel that it should aU blaze away against honest fellow-subjects, doing simple clerk's work, and coming from their desks to explain why they like fivepence better than threepence in the sheet -of figures before them. The whole mignifi-cance of the choice lies in the fact that a penny a-pound on tea represents about a quarter of a million to the Exchequer. The head of that department explaine that he expects to want half a mnllion, and the othei side allege that he can -contrive to do without it. At all events, they say, let him show first how much he wants. These need not be angry questions, but even last night, when the atmosphere had a little cooled down, they were discussed as if they -were conflicting allegiances or articles of faith. According to MIr. GLADsToNo, the CHANCELLOR of the ExCnEQuEir was still unconstitutional, -dishonest, retrogressive, indifferent to the comforts of the people, a trucebreaker, a layer of new ;burdens, and a great deal more,-terms worse than -which could hardly have been applied to a man 'who had not only invented a new and oppressive 'tax, but proposed to enact it without the au'thority of Parliament.
There are few of our readers, too-even those 'gifted with the strongest appetite for Parliamentary intejligence-who will not agree with us that these -accounts can be done with rather less length of 'talk. NWere the object to 'win a wager by "talking an hour on the superior virtues of one figure over another, there could not be wore needless amplification and more intrusion of unnecessary topics. One is continually reminded of the old Greek joke about the mnan who must be stronger than HRFCULES, because he was always dragging him in head and shoulders. In this way, if in no other, Mlr. GLADSTONE has now established his superiority over Sir R. PEEl, for there is not a single proposition on which we are not referred to the " great proces," and " grand "principles," and financial reformation, and Sir 1. PEEL himself at proper intervals to concen'ratt these ideas. Then, as for the comforts of the poor, that too is a point on which common sense has as much right to bc lisened to as philanthropy, particularly as com-
mokense is generally laconic, and philanthropy apt 'to be longwinded. To the clas5 of consumers that
lIIa most claims to the regard of the philanthropist, 'the laboure's wife, or the old woman living as she
can, with a consumptionof 51b. of tea in theyear, the
difference between the CHNCELLopR of the ExcEQvan' , proposition ana Mr. GLADsTo-.m's fo
-the next -year- amounts to tenpence, or considerably less than a farthing a-week. But even
this difference, according to all the theories of taxation, -falls partlyf though irrgularly, on the class of employers, and, in all fairness, we cannot estimate the difference to the old woman at more than half a farthing a-week. Now, we humbly submit this is not so severe, So intolerable a contribution towards the unpaid expenses of the war,-not to be compared, at all events, with -the loss of relatives and other calanities which have fallen to the iot of mnany among us. We need not repeat how the arreax of the war expenditure have been divided between the richer and poorer classes, between direct and indirect taxation; our only object in touching on this point is to urge upon oratorical financiers that it is not one that calls for verbosity and sentiment. CHATHAM and BuRnE were magnificent orators, but then they adapted their style to their subjects, and had subjects worthy of their style; they would not have swollen a twopenny question like this to the colossal dimensions of an estranged colony or a ravaged empire.
The Government is not disposed to delay for
The Government is not disposed to delay for a moment active measures for the settlement of the Chinese dispute. The Opposition will be gratified to a certain extent, inasmuch as a Plenipotentiary will shortly proceed to China with full powers to conclude a peace. This person, whoever he may be, will not, indeed, supersede Sir J. Bowni?re, or in any way dispense with the assistance of the men who are at present conducting the affairs of the country in the Eastern Seas. He will, however, have the advantage of knowing the wishes of the Cabinet from the mouths of the Mrinisters themselves, and he wil be acquainted wvith vwhat has been said and done at home, while Sir J. B~ v- PINo, Sir M. Snzmoui, and Mr. PAREXS will be able to supply him with the necessary local knowledge. A mllitary commander, with 5,000 men, will also at once be despatched to the scene of the disturbance. Of course, if the area of hostilities widen this force wMil be increased. The Plenipotentiary will, we believe, seek to establish direct communication not Aith YEH, but with the EbrrERon. The Opposition which holds Lord PALINERSTON responsible for the acts of officials at the other side of the globe can hardly deny that the Court of Pekin should be held accountable for the acts of one of its greatest satraps, a potentate disposing of the lives and fortunes of ten millions of its people.
From Lord PALMERSTON'S statement on Thursday night we learn that an attempt to bring the civilized world into closer communication with the Celestial Empire had been under consideration by his Government long before the outrage on the Arrow. In fact, the relations betwreen our merchants and the native authorities had been for a long time in an uneasy state, especially at Canton. It will require a mind singularly philanthropical to believe that the offer of rewards for the heads of Englishmen by YEr, the mutilation and murder of the crew of the Thistle and sundry European stragglers by the same personage, the burming of the factories, the poisoning of the Hongkong bread, and the threatening notices of the Chinese mob in places so wide apart as Hongkong and Singapore, were merely the effects produced on untutored minds by our own cruel treatment. A governor and people so ready and so skilful in the perpetration of the vilest outrages must have had some little experience in crime and insult, and some little previous ill-will towards the objects of their vengeance. How true this is we find from the return of the outrages saffered by British subjects during the last few years, ouitrages which were latterly tending to become more frequent, and which were only avoided by the unceasing precautions of the English residents. A clearer understanding with the Chinese Governinent and opportunities of more frequent intercourse were therefore probably thought necessary by the Home.Government. The position of the empire also demanded some such step. Rebel annies held some of the most important cities, and the tottering dynasty of the Tartars was unable to hold its po>ition against these domestic enemies or to oppose the aggressions of the Russian empire, which has lately advanced its frontier some hundreds of miles further south, and taken possession of the valley of the Amour. To endeavour therefore to open communications with the Central Government in conjunction with other nations, such as France and America, was a natural course. So far from desiring to embroil the country in a local dispute at Canton, it was the desire of English politicians to relieve our trade from the insolence of the Canton authorities by drawing closer the relations between us and the monarchy itself.
The conduct of the barbarian YEH, however, precipitated and localized the question. We are now at war with the governor of an important province, and at the time we are writing the flanie may have spread to every part of the empire. It is useless therefore to talk of a merely peaceful mission. Whenever the Plenipotentiary is *sent to negotiate with the Court of Pekin, he must be preceded or accompanied by such a force as will convince that barbarous monarchy that treaties cannot be evaded with impunity, nor the demands of civilized intercourse repulsed without the certainty of retribution. The conduct of Lord PALMERSTON in the mat'er is perfectly reasonable. The Government did not begin the war,. and, though they recognize the necessity of strong measures, they are ready to send out a Plenipotentiary with full powers to carry on hostilities or to conclude peace. We cannot think, however, that the despatch of a professed pacificator is the most important step at the present moment. The first point is to see means taken to assert the rights of this country and to protect its interests. We may be assured that in the present temper of the Chinese, a temper to which they have been brought by years of inertuess and over-conciliation on oar part, any diplomatic advances will be considered as a sign of failing courage. Peace will come in due time, and the best way to hasten its arrival is to increase the force in the Chinese Seas, and to act with vigour and promptitude. We are glad to find by the last advices that troops were about to be despatched from Bengal to Singapore and Hongkong. The naval reinforcements, particularly of small craft, sent out from home vwll be in time to do excellent service in support of the land forr.es.. But tle. conclusiow of the war with Persia is the most opportune occurrence of the hour. By.the peace signed three days since twou fine bodies of troops, {hat -which garrisons Bushire and that which has probably by this time saie
from Bombay to join the former, will soon be free for service in China. Furthermore, the whole of the Indian navy, with a large fleet of transports, will soon be available. We trust that the best use will be made of these appliances, and that in a few months we may be able to announce the conclusion of the Chiness difficulty, with guarantees for more easy intercourse with the country, and for the suppression of such insolence as has hitherto distinguizhed the provincial Government of Canton. _
In comparing the Army Estimates for the
In comparing the Army Estimates for the financial year commencing on the 1st of April next with those of the finaucial year which is now drawing to a close a good deal of confusion has arisen from the fact that the vote which was ultimately carried by theGoverninent for the current account is not that which was originally
proposed. On the first niht of the session Mr. diADSTOIa, who has a fatal facility for drawing tremendous conclu3ions from very trifling premises, made the rmost of this perplexity, proving in his cleverest manner that the Governmentvere either not going to roduce the Army Estimates at all or were going to reduce them to a sum that would be ridiculously small even in the eyes of the members of the Peace Society; and, however his reasoning may be open to condemnation, the fact of which he thus adroitly availed himself is not to be denied. To popular apprehension there is a perplexity; there is a continual dauger of referring to one et of Estimates while thinking of another; and, although this danger is not very great so long as we are dealing with totals, it is at once felt when we come to examine details; for, while in the Army Estimates just printed the total sums required in the coming year for military purposes are compared not only with the original Estimates of February last, but also with what the Committee of the House will chiefly regard,-the reduced Estimates of May,-the individual items are for the most part compared with only one of these sets of figures,-the former-that is to say, the least important. In giving a rapid summary of the moneys required for the Army we shall endeavour to keep this distinction clearly in view; and, before proceeding to details, it may be as well to begin with a repetition of those grand totals which are the principal objects of dispute between the rival financiers of the House of Commons. The number of HER MAJESTY's Forces which it is proposed to maintain for the next year is 126,796, or 120,000 less than was required both in the original and in the revised Estimates of the current year. Properly speaking, indeed, the diminution is much greater than we have indicated, seeing that under the head of HEs MA TsVS Forces are not included, for purely technical reasons, the Embodied Militia and the Army Works Corps, the combined numbers of which were about 130,000. In the original Estimates of last February these divisions of our military force were rated at 3,500,0001.; in the revised Estimates 1,250,0001. was demanded for them; and now they disappear entirely from the accounts. The Army being thus largely reduced, the total sum required for the maintenance of its effective services is very little beyond 9,000,000I.-that is tio say, almost exactly half its present cost, and less by 23,743,0001. than it was estimated to cost this time last year. To these Estimates, however, must be added the charge for non-effective services, which is almost unvarying, and which at present amounts to 2,500,0001., so that the grand total which the House will now be asked to vote is 11,250,0001. This very large decrease is principally effected under the head of Supplies, including clothing, provisions, forage, furniture, and warlike stores, the sum which Lord P.4xJuRzE asks being 1,960,5001., as against 6,500,0001. in the final and 14,257,3001. in the original Estimates of last session. But a very large reduction also takes place in the Pay, Allowauces, and Miscellaneous Charges of the forces. For the coming year the total asked is very nearly 5,000,0001.; the final Estimate of May last was 8,338,0001. (1,250,0001. of this being, as we have already intimated, for the Militia and Army Works Corps), while in the original Estimates the sum proposed was 14,596,9001. The difference between war and peace will at once be perceived in such facts as these. On the war footing contemplated in the original Estimates of 1856-57, the Supplies required for the Army were calculated to cost about as much as the Pay, the Allowances, and Miscellaneous Chargea of the whole Army in all its departments, with the exception of the civil establishments. On the peace footing contemplated in the present Estimates, the cost of Supplies is considerably less than half; it is about two-fifths of the amount required for Pay.
As regards the subject of Pay allotted to the different branches of the service, no one will be surprised to learn that the most marked reduction is made in the Recruiting Department, under which heading may be included the purchase of horses as well as the enlisting of soldiers. In the Estimates of last February the levymoney of recruits was calculated at 395,0001.; it is now calculated at 12,0001., and the whole cost of recruiting is set down at42,8001.,being410,0001. less than when this time last year war was in all our thoughts. In the purchase of horses the contemplated reduction is still greater. Observe the difference between the price of horses and the price of men. Our recruits in the original Eitimates of 1856 57 were calculated to cost 453,0001.; our horses were calculated to cost 742,0001.;
whereas now, in these days of peace, we propoe. to pay 42,8001. for our recruits, but only 32,9001. for remounts. So also other branches of the service are reduced in different proportions. Staff Pay and Allowances, which it is proposed to fix. at 263,7291., are reduced bv more than half; while Regimental Pay and Allowances, which are estimated at 4,119,0001., are reduced by less than half. Under the head of these charges, however, that which is most interesting is the sum required for the German military settlers st the Cape of Good Hope. In the original Estimates, to which we have so often referred, the total charge for the German Legion, cavalry and infantry, is more than 270,0001., the number of men of all ranks being. 10,454. The charge for 2,362 of these is in the coming year 92,7931., divided as follows:31,0001. for pay, 50,0001. as an allowance for buildiDg, and 11,5001. as an allowance for outfits, to be repaid from the second and third years' pay. As an experiment in emigration, it would be interesting to know the total estimated cost, which these accounts do not furnish, of this remarkable incident of the war.
Of the civil establishments connected with the Army the department which is obviously most worthy of attention is that of the Secretary of State for War, and this chiefly since it must still be regarded as only in a state of transition. Even under the best management it is not to be expected that the operations of this department can be reduced to a system which can have any claim to be called perfect so long as its business is conducted in
half-a-dozen offices scattered all over London; and we scarcely know whether to attribate to improved management or to increasibg confusion the fact that for messengers, both permanent and temporary, the cbarge* demanded for next year is even more than amid all the excitement of the -war; it is 7,5771., or nearly 2,00pl. more than was ask-ed, not in tbe. reduced, but in the original War Estimates of 1856-57. The proposed cost indeed, of the War-bffice is 162,6421.; or only 6,500t. Iess tban in the last War Estimate. The sum required for Buildings and Fortifications, like so many other items of these Estimates, is about one-half of the charge voted for the current year; it is 939,3601. Of this 245,9001. is required for Fortifications, and the larger portion-693,4501.-for Civil Buildings and Barracks. The final votes of last session were 407,0001. for the former, purpose, and 1,432,0001. -for the latter, front which it -will be seen that the Government have, comparatively eaking, reduced the sum allotted to our defences far less than the sum allotted to civil buildings and the accommodation of troeps. This will'e conide ei
natural if it is remembzfed that not only has the
:Regular Arny been reduced by nearly a half, but we have sho got ria of the Mlitia, for which in the fiat, the War Estimates of last sesaion, no Iess a sum than 250,0001. was required for mere huts. The most expensive single work of fortification that the Government has on hand is the improvement of the defences at Dover, which will cost the country 280,0001., and for which we are at present asked to contribute 16,0001. In these EOstimates appear, however, for the first time an item which i5 wrorthy of notice, indicating a somewhat extended plan "for the defence of commer"ial harbours of the UJnited Kingdom." The calcullated cost of these work-s is only 300,0001., and the sumn requireA to be voted immediately is 13,5001. As for Civil Buildings and Barracks, AlTershott comes in for the largest share of financial favour, 120,0001. being about to be aisbursed for- that purpose. Then comes Netley, which is to receive 50,0001. for a new Hospital intended to hold 1,000 patients; and all ovei the country it appears that barrack accommodation 'a to be very much extended and improved. There is nothing that can be done for the moral improvement of the soldier which probably will more conduce to that end than the providing of suitable and pleasant barracks. Lord PINaTsz has earned some reputation for his efforts to raise the condition of the private moldier, and for such purposes-for all that can tend to make the soldier a better and a happier man-there can be little doubt that the British House of Commons Wil vote without a grudge.

DUBIWN, FRIDAY MOPRuoS. THE ELEOTIOSSS Ih PROGRESS.
The announcement of an immediate appeal to the country will be rather diuagreeable intehigene to the four unhappy gentlemen how engaged in contesting the counties of Tipperary and Londonderr. The struggle for the latter seat commenced yesterday, and, as far as the first day'a polling goes, there would appear to be but little doubt that the Derbyite candidate 'ill have the honour-somewhat dearly purchased-of being the short-3ittig member for Londonderry. At the close yesterday the gross numbers were:
Clarke 2,234 Greer. .. ... 1,401
Majority for Clarke ...
In Belfast, which at present returns two Derbyite representatives, aome of the leading Liberals of the town have thus early had a meeting for the purpose of considering what measures it would be advisable to adopt in reference to the approaching general election. A resolution was adopted to the effect-
,That, as the prospect of a sudden disaolution of Parliament renders immediate action on the part of thc Liberals of Belfast necessary,Mr. John Francis Ferguson, D.L., Justice of the Peace; Mr. James M'Namara, Justice of the Peace; Mir. Wilham Sharman Crawford, jun.; William Dunville Mr. Bernard Hughes, Mr. Andrew Kirk Mr. Richard Waring, Mr. John [owan, un, *nd Mr. ieL Gardner be appointed an executie committee, with power to add to their number; and that such committee shall be authorized to take the requisite steps for holding a meeting forthwith of all the Liberal electors to make such arrangements as nsay appear siecessary."
Saunders's Newsletter publishes the following communication, dated Carlow, MIarch 5:-
" Since the result of the division in the House of Comuoos on Tuesday night has become known in this town the tlectors of the borough have been on the qui irc as to the candidates who will present themselves at the general election now approaching. Several ramours have been circulated yesterday and to-day as to the Liberal party putting forward M1r. John BaU,the ColonialUnder-Secretary, who at 1,resent is one of the county representatives. Another section are in favour of a Mr. Gridley, who lat year published an addzess in the local papers. All that is known of Mr. Gridley is that he is reputed to be very rich-no slight recommendation to a certain class of electorsin thisborough. The name of Mr. W. H. Burton, of Burton-hall, is also mentioned by a moderate section of both parties. Among the *ore influential Roman Catholic there is a strong jprejudice entertained agadnst Mr. Ball on account of his havng voted or the extension of the income-tax to Ireland. The Contervatives, in the meantime, are narrowly watching the comurse of events, feeling confidentthat they are in a position to re-elect thepreaent member, Mr. John Alexander, should he bedisposed again to seek thesuffage of his oonstituents 2Jluch fearis entertained thattheHon.CaptainPonsonby
brotherof the Earl of Besaborough, will be a cabdidate. If so, this would eause division among the Conservatives, many of wlhom are favourably disposed to give their support to that gentleman. It is, however, to be hoped that such a catartrophe wmll not take place, which would have the effect of placing this celebrated borough in the hands of theWhigs. Sadlelisn is as rampant as ever in this town, notwithstanding any assertions to the contrary; but it is to be desired that it will be efficacously crushed in this country at the nuxt election. With reference to the county, I believe I may state that Captain Bunbury and Mr. Henry Bruen will be the sitting members, as the state of the registry precludes the poesibility of a contest."

DUBLIN, F)RIDAY EvsaN-G. THE T1PPERaRY BAIHK APPEArS.
The Lord Chancellor gave judgment this afternoon on the appeal from the order of the Mlaster of the Rolls in the case of " Ginger " and the other English shareholders. The Lord Chancellor discarded all questions in the case save what he considered to be the real and main point for discussion -whether MIr. Ginger had become a member of the copartnership or was in any sense a contributory to the duties or engagements of it. He did not think that it was at all thrown upon a purchaser of shares to take any substantive motion in a court of equity, save as had been done here, to relieve himself from the responsibility of being a contributory; he therefore looked upon the proceedings in the present case as if they bad been upon a bill filed by the purchaser for the purpose of having his name erased from the share register-book and the assignment of shares annulled. His Lordship said that the whole question in the case was narrowed tG the consideration whether, in point of fact, Mr. Ginoer had not been deceived and defrauded in the very essence of the transaction, by being led to suppose that he was buying one thing when in point of fact he was buying another. It appeared to him to be a clear case of fraud and conspiracy on the part of John and James Sadleir, and therefore, hIr. Ginger having been defrauded by them, as the agents of the other shareholders, be could not be held to :be a contributory for the liabilities entailed upon them by the misconduct of those to whom they intrusted the management of their affais The order of the Rolls -xhould therefore be afflirmed, and with costs, The order of the Master of the iolls was likcewiseaffirmed ro form in the cases of Mr. Sterling and Mr. J; Birch Kennedy, with a view to their being argued at once before the Court of Appeal, which. it is understood will sit on MIonday.

EAORDINARY CASPE
A man about 30 years of am, who gave the mani of William Webb, describing 'irmself as a sailor, ana who re. fused at the sthtion-house to give to Sergeant Webb, 816 (acting inspector), any information as to where ho livod, was brought up in custody and placed at the bar of the Marylebono Police-court, before Mtr. LoNG, charged with having atterpted to murder Mr..Alfred Backler, assistant to MIr. Reolick, linendraper, High-street, Poplar.
The case, from its horrible nature, excited a great deal of interest, and tho court was much crowded. Mr. Luxton the superintendent of tho S division, attended and produced a certificate from Mr. Robertson, surgeon at Poplar, describing the serious nature of the wounds inflicted, and which were stated to be of a dangerous character. Mr. Lo2G.-Is the injared person present?
Mr. Luxton.-He is not, Sir. He is quite unable to come here, and it is impossible to say as yet whether the wounds he has received may cause his death or not.
Mr. LoNsG.-Let the witness who can speak as to the con*dition in which he found the wounded man in the carriage be sworn.
WilliamSandford wasthen called. He said,-Iam a porter in the service of the London and North-Western Railway Company, doing duty at the Hampden-road Station at the signal-post. About 20 minutes past 8 o'clock on Thursday evenig, as the train from Black-wall waa approaching the station platform, while it was in motion, I heard loud cries of " Murder " and "H Help " in one of tho carriages of the train. When the train stopped I went to a carriage from which itappearedtome that the soundofthe voiceprooeed, when on opening the door of it I saw a gentleman inside holding a knife in one haad, and he was holding another man with the other hand. He (the gentleman) exclaimed "For Gods sake, porter, help me, for I am being murdered by this man." I took hold of the knife, and at the time blood was dripping from it. The gentleman, who was bleeding profnsely from a wound in the neck, was assistof out of the carriage, after which I seized hold of the prisoner.
Ur. Lo ).-What did he say when you took holdof him? Witness.-He said, "The knife don't belong to me. It belongs to that gentlemen. He has tried to stab me, and I took the knife away from him, and I stabbod him instead." I cautioned him, observing that whatever he might say might be brought forward in evidence against him upon a future occasion.
Mr. LoxG.-When the prisoner said that the prosecutor attempted to stab him first, did he (prosecutor) make any remark ?
Witness.-Yes, Sir. He said it was all false.
Mr. LoNG.-When the gentleman, bleeding as ho was, was taken out of the carriage, where was he taken to ?
*Witness.-To the secretary's room. I kept tho prisoner Eecurely until a policemen came, and I gave him into his custody.
Ur. L4NoG.-Did you see any wound on the gentleman ?
Witness.-Yes, Sir. Blood was streaming from a sound in his neck all the way from the carriage to the secretary's room. At the period when the prisoner was given into custodythe gentlemanwasqniteexhaustedfwomlossof blood.
Mr. LoNG.-While in the secretary's room was any surreon sent for?
Witness.-Yes, Sir. Oar own surgeon was caUed in immediately.
Policemen Ball, 340S, produced a knife new, andhaving upon it marks of blood. TThe blade was about five inches in length, and the handle was rudelt formed. Tho implement was such a one as is usually used by butchers for slaughtering pigs and other animals.) He said,-The gentleman who had been wounded said to me that the prisoner stabbed him in several places, and that he succeeded in wresting the knife from the prisoner; that he got him down in the car'iage, when he held him as long as he oould. On their way to the station-house he reped what he had beforo stated as to the knife not being his.
Mr. Alford, surgeon, No. 25, Haverstock-hill, said,-I was called to attend the wounded man (Mr. Alfred Buckley) about half-past 8 o'clock on Thursday evening. I found him at the station. His clothes were saturated with blood. He had a wound in the neck about an inch long, and nearly an inch deep, inclining upwards. After taking off his clothes I found a wound in the upper p art of the left arm of about the same width, bat much deeper. There were scratches on his forehead and a contusion also on tbe right Fide of the chin, and between the forefinger and thumb of the right hand,which the 4entleman accounted for by saying that they were caused during a straggle which ensued when he was endeavouring to get possession of the knife. The wound in the neck was about one-third of an inch from the carotid artery, and had it penetrated that vessel death must have immediately ensued.
Mr. LOSG.-Look at this knife, Sir. Are the wounds you have spoken of likely to have been in'lictedwith such aknUe?
Witnesm-Most certinly.
Mr. Luxton here said that he had been to the house at which the unfortunate sufferer lived, and that he found him in A very weak condition.
Mr. LoSG (to tho prisoner). -This is a charge of a most serious nature which has been preferred against you. If the person whom. a alleged, you have stabbed should die, which may probably be the cae, you may be put upon your tbial for murder.
The prisoner, after being cautioned In the usual way, said,-X was in the carriage, and asked the gentleman what o'clock it was. He told me it was 20 minutes past S. I told him that his watch, which he had pulled out, was too slow, We had someo words, when he struck me. I struck him. He pulled out his knife syimg that he would have myhfe. I had a struggle with him and got the knife out of his hand. I called for help andhe called out "t turder." On the train stopping he gave me ito custody for attempting to take his life.
The prisoner was remanded till to-morrow (this day) week. From inquiries made by our reporter subsequent to the magisterial investigation he was informed that tho injured person was in such a state as to render his recovery extremely doubtful. At 5 o'clock, on the arrival of the Govemment van, the prisoner was conveyed tberein to the House of Detention. A considerable number of persons had congregated round the vehicle to obtain a sight of him.

THE CITY FOGtERIES.
CENTRAL CRIXWA.L COURT. Xu= 6.
Thix morning James Townsbend Saward and James Anderson, found guilty on Thnrsday of forgery to a large extent oi the City Bank, were placed at the bar to receive sentence.
Both prisoners peeented a very dejected appearce, particularly Saward, who held his head down during the whole of the Chief Baron's address to them previous to passing sentence.
On being placed a' the bar,
The Clerk of Arrigns called on each of them and said, -You are convicted of forgery. Have you anything to y why tlhe Court should not proceed to pass sentenoe upon you?
SaWard.-1sfore your Lordsbip pases sentence in my ca-s I humbly ask yoa to defer it till nex't seasion. I have no objection to make of the verdict on the evidence add*uoed, or of the impartial, just, and impressive summing up of sour Lordship; but I make the applicstion under the following circamstances :-I ask at your Lordship's hands to be showzrra little consideration in consequence of my anfortunite and defenceless position; and perhaps your Lordship will have the kindness to order that a copy ofour Lordship's notes on the evidence of certain witnesses which I will name shall be lodged with the Governor of Newgate, to be mado such use of as I may be hereafter advised.
The CssrsuB,uRoN.-Yoarreouestisenti,elynoveL I never hEard In the whole of my experience, nor have I met in the whole course of my reading, of such an application being mnade, founded on no grounds whatever.
Saward.-Mv position is a most unfortunate one.
T'he CusF AtROiX.-You do not state for what object you want nuy notes of the evidence.
Saward.-M2y reason is that I consider much of the evidence received yesterday was inadmissible.
The CErF BARoON.-Then the proper oourse for yom to havo pursued wavis to have objectd yesterday to its audission. I thought the whole of the evidence was admissible. It was the subject of coltinual consideration in my own mind, and its admission was frequently the result of tbe Ioint oInion of myself and MIr. Baron Bramwell, whose ad an assistance 1 have had on this occasion. I was myself very careful not to admit anything that did not appear to me to be evidence. I objected at first to tl3e admission of eertain matters, but after consideration they appeared to mer to be admissible and I admitted them. You do not now state any grounsis for your application except that you want the notes. You do not state what objection you have: to take, and it appears to me that you only want them to have an opportunity of finding out some objection.
Saward-Just so, my Lord. I wYas not aware until yesterday morning that 1 should be undefended.
The Cmixi' BARON.-I can be no party to your application founded on that objection. The appointuient for the trial was made and the irrangements concluded as early as Saturday last. You are perfectly aware that you ought to bavo made such an application earlier, or, at any rate, that zou ought to have made ap hcation on affidavit, prepated Dy in attorney, and which should have stated why you were not prepared with counsel. I tbink you are quite as well circumstanced now as you would have been had such an application been made.
Saward.-The briefs wore prepared yesterday, but unfortunately I could not get the money In time.
The CsimF BASRON then proceeded to pass sentence. in the followiner terms :-James Townshend Saward and James Anderon, you are to receive the judgmentofthe Court, founded on the verdict of the jury delivered yesterday, which pronounced each of you to be guilty of the offunces charged in the indictment, that of forging and uttering on the 18th of August Ist year an order for the payment of 100l., which order was described in various counts of that indictment also as a check. The trial lasted many hours. Much evidence *ag given, and much which in one sense might be considered somewhat unusual, and which I pointed out to the, attention of the jury in sumrming up the case last night. It is not usual in the administration of the criminal justico of this country to have more than one crime Vproved at a time against one person charged with. many, but as I then stated and think it right again -to state, for the purpose of making out a guilty knowledge by any person included in the indictment it was necessaryto
rove thecommissionof crimes, andtherule that excludeseviaence of tho commission of other crimes, for fear of creating prejudice against a prisoner, ceases, and it then becomes the imperative duty of the judge to adu.it that sort of evidencee which otherwise he ought to reject. The case aginst you luade outyesterdaypresents one of the most astonishing and alarming instancos of crime that it has been my misfortuhe to witness on any occasion since I have been a judge, and I am not aware that the history of the cnminal. justice of this country presents any case more formidable than that which was disclosed by the evidence adduoed against you yesterday. It is a maxim ina the admirnstration of the criminal law, that combination lenders crime more mischievous and alarming, and that it calls for greater severity of punishment than when a crime has been the single act of one individual; and there never was a clearer specimen of the proof ofthe propriety of that practical maxim thanappeared yesterday in the evidence against you. It was made out to the satisfaction of the jury, and to my entire and perfect satisfaction, that there had existed for many months, possibly for manyyears, a combination, of which you, James Towvshend Saward, were a party, by which the crin e of forgery was to bo committed-by a combination of partins, all of them involved in tho same guilt. With the assistnooe of a person unconscious ot the crime he was furthering -innocent, so far as any intention on his part was concerned, altogether of the offence, bht, by extraordinary ingenuity and contrivance, made not a reluctant, but a ready assistant in the crime'by such means as these it is made perfectly clear that, inL a great many instances, crime was succesfully perpetrated with perfect success and security, and for a long period the guilty escaped tho justice of the country. This soheme ap peas to have been carried out, by a strange connexion witlh
auglars and pickpokets, to obtain blank checks and cancelled cheeks, and where the latter could not be obtained recourse was had to fictitious actions, whereby the writing of the party was obtained by his check being given for the amount recovered, and thus facilities were obtained for imitating his handwriting. At lengthan accident gave scluet to the whole matter, it was brought forwArd for public investigation, and then the whole truth became manifest. It was then distinctly proved that you, James Anderson, inveigled innocent persons, as T have described ; and you, James Townshend Saward, actuated by that caution in which you apparently prided yourself, freely communicated with those men who were stamped with the character of felons, and wbo could scarcely bo credible witnesses against {ou You cautiously kept out of the way when checks nad to be presented or money to be paid or receivedbut it so turned out that the proceedings of some of the patty at Yarmouth sad Norwich were discovered, and there could be no doubt that the letters were in your handwriting as well as the writing on the forged documents. It is imnpossible to doubt the truth of thestatements made yesterday by AttweU and Hardwicke, however unworthy of credit they may appear to be from the crime which stains their past life and character, that yon both were paities to the entire scheme of sendinu forth to the world the checks and bills that were produced Kesterday, at the bettomof which schemeyou, JamesTowans. nend Saward, were probably the mostconspicuons. Formerly, there can be no doubt but that each of you would have ex-
iated your crime by an ignominious death. I ro,oice, Eowover, that I have not to pass that sentence, but whatever the law holds out with a view to deter from such offencoes appears to mo to be the just measure of punishment to persons who have filled up the largest measure of crime. I was requested yesterday to take notice of the case as regards one of you with a view to a mitigation of the sentence, but after fuU consideration I feel bound not to listen to the appeal of Sir F. Thesiger; and had the prosecution been conducted by the Attorney-Oenoral, and had he made a similar application, I stould have felt bound not to comply with it, but to paset the ful sentence, leaving it to the Executive to consider and, determine thereon. Should an application be made to the Home Secretary, and I am applied to, I shall have mnuch pleasure in giving it my careful attention. In the present stte of the case I can make no distinction between the cautious person who, though privy to the whole transaction, screens hitnself as far as possible from being personally mixed up with,it, and the person who has acted asagent, but who has displayed a capacity for crime and an ingenuity and an abundance of resource for the purpose of committing that crime, worthy of a better cause, and which would, in all probability, have produced wealth and whatever m4iht have rewarded stcce sful ingenuity, if it had received a virtuous instead of a criminal direction. I lament, with respect to you, James Townshend Saward, that you must have been at one period of your life in circumstances far different from those in which the Court has found you in-- volved. It is stated, and not denied, that you are a member of an honourable profession; and I deeply regret that the ingenuity, skill, and talent which has received so per verted and mistaken a direction has not been guided by a sense of virtue and directed to more honourable aud useful ?pursuits, I-m called upon to passB sentence upon you, andL for the reasons tb it Ihave assigned it is imnsihle for me to ttp abort of the utmostt limitt to 'which felawr pormite the putnishment to proceed. Any maitigation that mar accrue to either must come fromn a different source. Thee learned judge then passed sentenoe of transportation for life on each Fthe in tht utmsl temns.
The prisoners were then remotod from the docl.

PARIS, THURSDAY, MARCt 5, 6 P.x.
The Conference on the question of INeuchUtel cpened to-day at 1 o'clock. The first meeting is merely one of form, but it will be followed by others at sbort intervals until the question is definitively settled. It is right to take advantage of the present favourable humour of the King of Prussia, as no one kIows the moment when a change may come over the Royal mind. Depatchees were received yesterday from the Marquis de Moustier, the French Minister at Berlin, relative to the same question. They are so far favourable that they state His JMajesty is well disposed for an arrangement, and that he wishes the day for the meeting of the Conferences to be shortly named. It was immediately afterwards that this day was fixed. The affair will doubtless appear of little importance beside the graver ones which now occapy public attention; but it is as well to have a complication the lees at this moment.
The signiing of the Treaty with Persia is also an additional relief, and leaves us but one war to attend to. Nlo one appears more satisfied with this amicable solution than Feruk Khan. He went yesterday to the telegraph-office to have the pleasure of transmitting in person his despatch to Bucharest, where an attacha of the Persian Embassy has been waiting for intelligence in order to set out at once for Teheran. Feruk Ehan remained at the offlice till he got the answer, which he did in less thanhalf an hour. He uttered an exclamation of wonder and delight on receiving the reply to his despatch. He will proceed to London for the ratification of the Treaty.
A private letter from Vienna announces the eceipt of a. telegraphic despatch from Constantinople, stating that after the death of the Kaimaikan of Moldavia a Provisional Government had been installed with the consent of the foreign Consuls, and that this Government will act until the Porte shall have made some other appointment.
The following are the observations of the French papra on the late division in the House of Commons
The Pabie strongly advocates the energetic prosecution of the war, and concludes its remarks with the bolowing passage,-
" Wil the motion of Mr. Cobden, voted by the House of Commons (which must certainly lead to the dissolution of the Cabinet or ofthe House), result in arrting the progress of events bafore Canton? We hope not. Great distances, which at times present great inconveniences, have this advautage, that they permit accomplished facts to weigh with immense power on the match of human events. Should Sir John Bowring succeed before the arrival of the vote of censure recorded by Parliament in entering as a conqueror Into that city, which he first sought only to enter as a simple visitor, we do not think that England, which has absolved Warren Hastings and Clive, whose glory was nevertheless tarnished by well authenticated crime, will impute blame to a man for an excess of zeal, justified and glorified by success.7
The Univers entertains similar views, which it expresses in more energetic language than that adopted by its contemporaries. It says:-
"1 What do all these solemn debates and philanthropic declamations really signify? One sole object,-the political adversaries of Lord Palmerston wish to obtain his puce, or, if they cannot succeed in so doing, they seek at least to display their eloquence, for the constitutional game must be played out. And while the Parliament of England is gravely discussing the justice or legality of this war the Chinese are setting-a price on the heads of Europeans, and are surrounding them with assassins, incendiaries, and poisoners. The Bis,hop of Oxford in his speech evidently lost sight of all that Christiannationu have suffered from China; he saw nothing but the question of the!Arrow. But our correspondents at Hongkong, who are not Englishmen, j udge it in a very different light from the Anglican bishop, and their opinions appear to us less open to suspicion. Now, with respect to China, who can seriously question the right possessed by Christian Powers to call that barbarian nation to account for treaties perpetually violated, and for the blood of Christians constantly shed? Ths English orators are really too con. siderate when they invoke the right of nations, justice and humauity in favour of a population which, by ever; act, places itself beyond the right of nations, and systematically violates aU the laws of humanity and justice."
The Sik thus expresses itself:-
" Inmeuse wiU be the joy of the Royalist journals on thil
side of the Channel; but it is a child's joy: the person they disliko is beaten, and they laugh wibhout reflecting on the serious consequences of the event which inspires the'r delight. In England, where the Parliament and Government entertain the most profound respectfor public opinion, the question is only opened by the adoption of the Cobdon motion. Lord Palmerston will not consider himself beaten, and he wiU appeal to the electors of free England."
The anticipations offered above have been partially realized by the AssemblUe Natinwle, which alone of the Pauris journals condemns the conduct of .Admniral Seymour. The following are the views it expresses
" Will the Premier obtain from the Queen permission to dissolve Parliament? Should he obtain it, would he succeed in obtaining from the electors the reversal of the verdict given by the Bouse of Commons after the most solemn debate ? These are questions which need not yet be exanmined; but, whatever may be the resolution taken by the Crown, whatever may be the result of an appeal to the electors in circumstances where the national self-esteem might perhaps be skilfully worked uponi, the vote of the House will remain as the etermal condemnation of a policy which has been justly censured by the most eminent men of all parties, and by those who are most devoted to the real sgrabdeur of England. Were another Miistry possible in the present dissolution of political parties, the Cabinet headed by Lord Palmerston would have no other alternative than to bend its head and withdraw before this condemnation."
The following is from the De-bas:'
" It is impossible to dissimulate on the serious nature of the check experienced by the Cabinet of Lord Palmerston. After such a check, everybody will understand, and Lord Palmerston wiU certainly himself understand, that he cannot appear again before the present House of Parliament. The only question that can aise is to know whether he will abandon his position to the chiefs of the coalition, -who have dealt him this terrible blow, or whether he will decide on dissolving the House, and wil appeal to the countr."
Despatohes are said to have been received to-day by the FRrench Government from its Minister at Tutrin, giving hopes of a favourable change inl the relations between the Austrian and Piedmontese Governmnentsn.
The French papers were some time since prohibited from publishing notices on the Russian railroad projects. The prohibition bas been this day removed. The new law imposing a tax on all Bourse transactions will, it is said, contain a special cenactmGelt with respect to the coslissiers, or out door agents.
A private letter from Constantinople, dated the 2d uIt., says:-
" Our city continues to merit the name of the ' Hospodar market,' once given to it by a German diploWlatist. We have here Bibesco, his nephew, the 'Wadi Jorgee, Stirbey, known at Bucharest as the Spathar flpoven, apt3 the Jan Ghika, who has some from Barnc, -but ineXefrfor the purpose of loudly declaring that it is vby no means his intention to swell the list auf candidates. Bibesco has gone away, but he has, Ubi-. Id; left in the hands of a furnctionary highly placed yery considerable mark of his desire to return as Hospodarto the Principalities.

VIENNA, MfARCH 3.
The General Assembly of the Austrian Crodit
Bank took place yesterdlay for the first time andl the following is a brief coonnt of what;ccurreio. About 1,000 shareholders were preet, and at half-past 9 the'-sittino, was openedl by Prince Sohwarznberg, the Presid;ent of the Board of Directors, who addressed a short speech to aC ost heterogeneous
Tnsembly. Among the persons prsentCwere imny of the highest nobles, the prinipa, tbakers and merc0hants,obarristerse physic and, t mfitar men, the teditorws ofethe pyrincpalpapers,tradesmen, stockjobbers, Aterthe President ofteB ohad introduct ed to teassembly. mn the mpersa ommsssry,n wer vony
Brentheo, whoeista ouncllo theinctheaFaners nDepartment, the principal Director of the Credit Bank read the printed account of the transactions of the company during the year 1856. Subioined is a condensed summary of the contents of the docu. ment, which is of considerable length
" On the 31st December the 'Debtor Account' (passirv) of the company stood thus :-Subscriptions paid up, 30,491,420fl.; balance of current accounts, 40,685,064f. 18k., bills of exchange for the establishment in cireulatien, 3,093,087i. 42k.; interest of shares which had not been claimed, 56,4555i.; profits derived from the stock of the company, 4,369,0361f. 52k.; commission, 160,5225. 52k.; interest, 1,526,959fi. 50k. Taken together, the foregolng sums make 80,*392,246fl, 34k.; but as 171,635l. 14k.; as the outlayfor bureaux, payment of clerks, and furniture, must be deductedfrom it, the totalof this propertyisg0,210,683f. 20k. The 'Creditor Aocount' (activ) vas as followsv-Certi. ficates of railroad shares, 8,856,034fl. 15k.; insdustrid stock of different kinds, 5,198,114fL; Government stock, 6,468,897fl. 9k.; Priority Bonds, 959,802S. 23k.-together, 21,482,847M. 47k. Bill Portfolio, 22,768,0525. 27k.; advances made on Government and indusCrieZ stock, 19,836,238fl. 47k. ; balance of current accounts, 12,234,9221L 27k.; cash in hand, Exchequer-bills, and coupons, 2,886,854Q. 30k. ; furniture, according to inventory, 36,039fl. 57k.; interest paid in advance on own shares, 965,72711. 25k.. Total of thisproperty, 80,210,683Q.20k. By the foregoing it wll be seen that the gross profits of the establishment amounted to 5,88465611. 20k. After deduct. ing 408,65011. 7k. for the 5 per cent. income-tax, and 965,7271. 25k., the abovementioned 5 per cent. interest on shares, the net profits amount to 4,510,278fl. 48k. As the Credit Bank did not begin business until Jan. 15, 1856, and as the greater part of the second instalment was not pa.id up until the end of November, the establishment worked during the year 1856 with a capital of about 19,000,000fl. Thus the Austrian Credit Bank pays to the sbareholders about 31 per cent. on the capital employed. The net profit of 4,510,278Q. 48k. was thus disposed of: -10 per cent. of that sum (451,027fl. 53k.) was set aside as a reserve fund; 5 per cent, of the remaining sum of 4,059,250fl.55k. wAs divided between the members of the Board of Administration, and another 5 per cent. among the dL-ectors and clerks of the establishment. As 10 per cent. on 4,059,250f. 55k. makes about 400,000Q1., the sum of 3,G00,GO11. remained, which was divided between the 300,000 shares, so that each share received, in addition to the 5 per cent. interest, 12fl., or 6 per cent. By the end of November last 50 per cent. per share had been paid up, and on the 31st Jrsuary, 1857, another payment of 10 per cent. was made."
Having thus laid before you a synopsis of the report presented to the shareholders by the Board, it becomes my duty to give some account of what occurred after it had been read. As Prince Schwarzenberg is no speaker, Count Francis Zichy (a member of the Council of the Empire), who is one of the Vice-Presidents of the Board, conducted the proceedings. After the mnatter of the report had been disposed of, Count Zichy produced a list of the90 persons who had the largest number of shares, and proposed that a certain number of them should be appointed by the President to examine the written votes of the Assembly, which had to elect three members of the Board, and three other persons whose duty it would be to audit the accounts of the company. M. Z-, the proprietor and editor of the most influential of the Vienna papers, objected to the plan, and insinuated that nominated "auditors" might possibly neglect to perform their duty to the satisfaction of the Assembly. Instead of allowing the President or his substitute to settle the matter, the Imperial Commiseary interfered, and with most unseemly vehemence decreed that six" auditors " should be appointed by the President. Prince Schwarzenberg, who evidently did not approve the tone employed by the representative of Government, put the somewhat ruffled assembly into the best possible humour by appointing the suppicious gentleman to be one of the six auditors. When the question relative to the dividend was brought forward M. Z- again rose, andbegan avehementtirade againstthe Board, accompanied by such violent gesticul3tions that he was called to order by Count Zichy, who told him that he, who had for many years been accustomed to speak in public (in the Hungarian Diet), thought it right to inform him that his tone and manner were anything but "parhamentary." After this reproof M. Z- became calmer, but, as he displayed an inclination to wauder from his subject, the Imperial Commissary seized the bell, and, ringing it violently, desired the President to take the sense of the Assembly as to the dividend. The Assembly unanimously agreed to the proposition of the Board, although every one present seemed to feel that M. de Brentcno had not showrn due respect either to M.
Zor to the noble President.
CountZichy was an excellentVice-President,but it was somewhat ungenerous in him to taunt the nonHungarian speakers with their ignorance of Parliamentary forms. Towards the end of the sitting M. Warrens, who was formerly the proprietor and editor of the Oestcrreihiscle Zeittng, rose and made a speech which seemed to produce as great an effect on the Board as it did on the Assembly. The speech of M. Warrens was not interrupted by clamorous applause, but whenever he paused the assembly expressed its admiration of his extraordinary talent as a public speaker by a low murmur of approvaL M.. Warrens touched on three different subjects-1. He suggested that it would be extremely advantageous both for the Credit Bank and the public if it were allowed to do " assurance business" on 'Change. 2. He proposed that the tantihme should be reduced to 5 per cent., of which the Board of Administration should have 4, and the enmploybs of the establishment 1 per cent. 3. He suggested that it would be as well if the statutes were so altered that anyshareholder violating paragraph 24* should be punished with the loss of his right to vote, and any member of the Board with the loss of his highly lucrative post.
When M. Warrens had concluded his speech no speaker could obtain a hearing, and consequently the sitting was soon at an end. A person who, like myself, knew Austria before she was regenerated, could not but be greatly struck with what took place yesterday. Had not the Imperial Commissary thrown the " high Government " (hohe Regies'ung) into the faco of the Asembly every ten minutes, and remained seated while he spoke, I could have fancied myself in Hamburg, or in any other German cityin which thepublic isallowed to express its opinion freely.
Cr6dit Bank sbares rose to 290 to-day, which is an advance of 4fl. 30Ok. since yesterday.
*Your readers will understand what is meant on learning that 100 sbares only entitle a person to four votes, but if he enters 20 sbares in his own name, and 80 in the names of four of his friends, he gets fiVO Totes.

For th a 8th of April the last price was 93k to 94. There wa: a considerable demnand for money at 6 per cent., and some heavy loans were obtainedfrom the Bank on the ftocks now shut for the dividends.

In the discount-market to-day there was an undiminiashed demand.
The Addres to Lord Palmeraton from the under-' writers and subscribers at lAoyds', requesting him to become a candidate for the city of London, having received 375 uignatures, was preseated this afternoon by Mr. Richard Thornton, the oldest member of that establishment. The feeling was unanimous, and the list eontains the names of merchants and underwriters of all shades of political
opinion. It is stated that among au who were in-.. vited to join there were only six refusals. After it, had been withdrawn for presentation more than 10.) additional members applied for the purpose of signing it. The total number of subscribers to Lloyds' is about 1,500, but the average daily attendance is only about 600. The number of signatures obtained indicates, therefore, that the entire body are animated on this occasion by one feeling. Trhere is no class more deejly interested in the legitimate progress of the commerce of the world and in the maintenance of respect for the British name than the London underwiters, and the demonstration i. therefore entitled to be regaded as one of the most important that could havebeen made at the present juncture.
There was little activity in foreign securities, but prices on the whole were fairlysupported. Turkish Six per Cents. were dealt in at 97k and # for the account, and Mexican at 22k. The other business comprised-Brazilian Five per Cents., 102j; Peruvian, for account, 781; Russian 5 per Cents., 104
and i; the Four-aud-a-Hal per Cents., 98i; Spanish Three per Cents., for account, 41 ; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 98 and .
In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rate upon Hamburg was a shade lower. With regard to other places there was no important variation.
The corn-market this morning remained without recovery.
The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the wreek shows a quiet business, with a tendency to firmness at; the close.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents, on the Paris Bourse this evening were 70f. 20c. for money, and 70f. 65c. for the end of the month, showing a further fall of three-eighths percent. In shaes there was likewise a depression, owing to the anticipations regarding the tax about to be imposed on them, and also, perhaps, to the announcement that the prohibition against the publication by the newspapers of the Russian railway scheme has been roesinded.
A further sum of 20,0001. in gold was taken from the Bank to-day to pay for purchases of silver on the Continent.
It is stated that the Committee on the Bank Charter Act permanently adjourned this morning in consequeuce of the approaching dissolution of Parliament.
In the colonial produce-markets during the week, although there has been less buainess than for some time past, the quotations have in most instances been fairly maintained. Sugar was dull at the commencement, and no improvement occurred until to-day, when a more animated demand was manifested. Late advices from Ceylon reporting farther large shipments of coffee to French ports gave a firmer tone to this market, which is still barely supplied, and native Ceylon has again improved. Rice continues steady, but the inquiry for white kinds has been less active. In spice the principal feature is a considerable advance in casaja ignea, which has changed hands to a fair extent, holders now requiring still higher terms. The operations in saltpetre have been upon a rather hmited scale, tbe market closing with a quiet appearance, and the parcels brought to public sale having been chiefly taken in. The business in tea has ncreased, and for most descriptions a better feeling, has existed. Common Congou upon receipt of the letters from China advanced id. per lb., and several thousand packages have changed hands at from is. id. to Ils. lJd. per lb., there being ultimately buyers at the latter price.
The return from the Bank of England for the vreek ending the 28th of February gives the following results when compared with the previous week .-
Public deposits ... ... . £7,4189 ... Increase £.228,899 Other deposits . .. lO,715,611 ... Increase 1,421,103 Rest . . 3,719,54... Increase 198,468
On the other side of the account:-
Government securties... £11,573, 889... Increase £43,6- 6 Other securities.. 19,620,343 ... Incrae 1,864,547 Notes unempleyed .... 5,516,910...Decrease 36,615
The amount of notes in circulation is 18,596,7301., being a decrease of 18,4251.; and the stock of bullion in both departments is 10,343,7151., shoWino' a decrease of 60,9751. when compared with the preceding return.
Tl;e rest in the present return is 3,719,8541., and a dividend of *k per cent. deducted from this amount would leave 3,064,9691. It is probab'e therefore that the next dividend will be declared at the above rate of 4i per cent.

China And The Chinese.
CHINA AND THE CRIM'E
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Having resided many years in China, and at Canton In particular, 1 beg to make a few observations which ths
tpeeches lately delivered in both Houmes of Parnli&ment upon the Chinese war question canl forth. To every one who has spent any time in China the remarks that ihave fallen from the soveral speakers show their total ignorance of their subject and everything relatin to China and the Chinese (Mr. Robertson excepted); *nd rtherefore venture topen these few lines with the view, if posible, of throwing a little light on the subject. Mr. Cooden, who, frora his position, might be expected to know something of the case, exhibits mLore ignorance than others; and no later than last night suggests, "tbat a person arned (not with weapons), but with full powers and competent authority to supersede all authority there might be sent out to overtako the mail at Malta and act with the Chinese authorities at Hongkong beforethemailcouldreachPel"Whatnonse I Whoever heard of any Chinese authorities residingat Hong. kong, or any English mail arriving atPekin? Does hlr. Cobden uppose that the Loong jounals at e laidupon he breakfast table of lis Imperial rajsty HYenfung, or any of his wsubl jects, and perused over a cup of 90wery Pekeei or doe he suppose thae the interpreters attached to the Britn Goc vernhoent in Chinaytranslat tit-bits into the Chinea banShna fouldiffnsion ymong the Celestisis in general and the hourt atvPekin in particular? He had better get up another Peace delegation and try if Yeh will ho as gracious in his reception as the hate Emperor of Russia; b ut before start ofg he hasd better taki e farell of his dear triends in case Yeh should say " nay," and stick his head on a bamboo. Should the party return safely to England they will have acquire:d more knowledge upon the subiect in the short time they are away than they have learned, or ever will learn, in England; erpericsaie decct4 Lorchas are coasting vessels difbeing but slightly from meny of the various kinds of vessels sailing on the Cbinese wraters. They are an improvement upon the native vessel of the sama class, with a round bottom and a rudder to lift up and down, with a sharp bow and cabin accommodation for foreign pasengers not found or required in the native craft, where all stow together Jike pigs-the closer the better
Before the introduction of steamers x superior class of lorchas were in much request by foreigners going betwten bsaco, Hongkong, and Cvatonr They also used a natiov vessel possessin D m ore am ple cabin aceom mod ati on, called a
fast coatn The choice was optional, a eserally depending upon the wing. Until within a few years the Portuguese at eacso were altd ost the sole owners of thin cargs oF vessel, and, I believe, they tnake their name from them, being exceedingly handy vessels to manage, the best of them havnge canvas or cotton tails, instead of the common mat ones in general use. They have been found exceedingly useFul of late among the foreigners, owving to the unsettlcd state of the country, in transporting cargo between Hongkong(whero it has been found convenient to store most cargo on arrival and Canton. They are owned by people of alI nations nd navigated by a foreigner; in aU cases they fly the national flag of the owner, and it is a question of economy whether it is kept unnecessarily fying in harbour or not. Some captains haul down tbeir trntiun soon after the vessel is anchored, but many fly all day and haul down at sunset, particularly when there is a man of war in port, taking the time from them, othenrisefromn the hauling down of the flags at the various consulates on shore.
In the caso of the Arrow, according to Lord Palmerston's statement, she had deposited her papers in accordance with the regulations at tbe British Conate; she was, therefore, to all intents and purposes, under the protection of the British authorities, and reported to the Hoppo, or Customhouse officer in course by the Consul; it is therefore absurd to argue that the Chinese authorities did not know tbat she was British. They must have known it; in fact, they know of tbe arrival of every vessel off Canton generally before the consignee or Consul. The river is crowded at the anchorage with Custom-house boats, re&dy to prevent smuggling should an attempt be made, or to arrange for passing all or part at a reduced rate of duty, without risk. As to flying aflag, every vessl is well known to these Custom-house officers after one or two visits, particularly if they have donb a little " smug-pigeon" together.
Mr. Consul Parkes, from his intimate knowledge of the Chinese, their language, and customs, acquired by along residence among them from a very early age, is, I firmly believe, wel qualified for the important office at Canton, andthoughIdo notherewish eithertodefend or condemn the proceedings that have taken place in Canton, I cannot help thinking but that there was just cause or he would not have required such steps. Have your readers forgotten the murder of the governor at Kaco a few years back by an emissary of the Chinese Goveniment, as events afkeriarls proved, in consequence of a threat made by him, but not acted upto? Idread the arrival of the nextimail, wellcnow. ing what a subtle race they are, and there are those among them .who would not only poison your food, but murder you in your sleep to make a few dollar Apologizing for the length of this,

"A fhort time beforo I arrived at Honolulu an E nglish ship put into that port on her voyage from Hongkong to some part of the coast of America, and chanced to have a Chinese woman on board, a domestic in the service of an Englih fanmily. No Chinese womAn ad atthat tiimoea n men in the islands, so that the circumstance caused at least curiogity enough to make the event verY soon gonerally known ; and of course it reached the cars of the few Chines
that were residing in the place. Among these, and at the head of his people, was a mandarin, Slam Sing by nae, who was keeping a little Ftore, and dealing in Chines ern e
chandise; and this worthy magistrato, impressed, as6it appeared, with a sense of the obligation which the arrival of his countrywoman imiposed upon him, applied to the ing, stating thaLt whereas, by t'he laws of China, no woman was allowed to leave her country, it was hiB duty to require tbst this woman should be given up to him, as the chief of her pntion resident in the islands, in order that he ighpgt deo A *ith her according to the Jaws of the empire. . * I

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sit,-Permit me to caU your attention to an instructive incident in connexion with the late debate on China.
News arrived last Monday morning of the diabolical attemot to murder the whole British community of Hong.
ko by meas of poison. lt was known to many persons on the afternoon of that day that Sir John Bowring andl the whole of his family were among the intended victims, and that they were all suffering fromi the effects of the poison when the mail started on the lath January. This fact was universally known in the Hoase of Commons on Tuesday.
To a vulgar mind like my own it would have seemed that at such a moment the better feelings of human nature inight have been temporarily called into play, and a slight, if only a slight, respite given to the torrent of abuse cast at Sir John Bowring, not merely as respects his public character, but as respects his honour as an individua.
But no ! The exigencies of party proved to be too great, and on thatvery Tuesday evening the right hon. member for Oxfordasir, a leading member of Lord Derby's Government,'did not scruple to use the word " liar" a.s respects Sir .Jobn Bowzring, antd to charge him, as reported in your coalumhns wi,th " deliberate, wilful untruth" and " dowuright
It is true that later in the evening the leader of the Op position, reprimanded the over-zeal of his followers, and said that he considered that Sir John Bowring had been " unjustly treated" throughout the debate.
On Thutsday evening, however, the member for Warwickshire returnedi to the charge, and accused Sir John Bowing of " falsehood." g'SrJh
The public will judge of the motives of those who, under such solemn cironuistances could act as above pescribed.
That public, perhaps, wl not be unmindful of the incident at the forthcoming general election.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIES.
Sir*-It conveys a veryinadequate view of the cruelty of the Chinese Governor Yeh to say that he slaughtered 70,000 human beings in cold blood. The most horrible element in the case is the fact that not one in a hundred of these victims was v. rebel or abettor of rebels. Bat Yoh, as a dealer in heads, not only buys, bat sells the article,.-buys, that he may SalL. His rewards at the Court of Pekin are in proporion to the number of heads he can show; and during the rebellion lie notoriously and openly " made up the tale" by murdering and beheading thousands of his innocent fellow.subjecta. When he beard of a village having been attacked by rebels he entered as soon as they were gone, and commnenced an indiscriminate massacre, on the plea that these poor people ought to have repeUed and exterminated the rebels. inferior officers did not wait even for such a plea; wherever they could lay their hands on a friendless man they beh-aded himn and got their bead. mnoney ; then Yeh sent the head to Pekin, and got his higher rate of head-money.
It is not surprisng that such a man should witness uimoved the misery occasioned by the war, which he could have stooped in a mioment ; in fact, the great disparit
brought to light in the course of hostilities was not so much our strength and their weakness as British humanity and
Chinese cruelty. It was this that made it an unequal contest. A benevolent admiiral hopes on that a simple demonstration of power wiU induce the Governor to a make the rzquired concession. But the man he has to do with is a stranger to mercy-indifferent to masacre. AllU that the 'admiral can do is to delay the stroke till it falls with aggravated severity on those on whom it was his great object to spare.
Thus Mr. Gladstone's rhetoric and invective, which prove so pwerfl in he lae deate, ere isdirected. The ropr obectof ll hs dnuncatins ught to have been the Chinese Governor Yeh, the true author of aU the

DAIReNG GARoTrE AmD ATrEMrT AT ROBBEBty.- A very daring case of garotting and attempt to rob was on Tuesday perpetrated in broad daylight in the shop of Mr. A14ka]idcr, jeweller, Gordon-street. The particulars are as f.Alow :-About half-p st 5 o'clock in the afternoon Mr. Alexander, sen., who had occasion to go out, left his shop in charge of a lad of about 14 years of age. Mr. Alexander ha onl been abrent for a few minutes when a m an entered wis'hng to purchase a gold hoop ring. The boy showed him some at rings, but these he refused to look at. The lad then informed him that his master was out, but that he would be in in a. few minutes. At that moment a second man entered, wishmig to purchase a gold watch. Not having authorityto shoyr watches the boy politely informed the man to this effect, and asked him to look back in a few minutes, when Mr. Alexander would be in attendance. The two men then left. They had only been absent for a feei minutes when they returned, and as soon as they got inside the shop the boy became suspicious, and, with the view of impressing them with the i ea that there were workmen under, and in communication with the shop, the boy remarked that he would ring the bell for some of the workmen to come up. He was proceeding to the window with this pretence when the man who first entered the shop, and the strongest of the two, suddenly seized the boy and compressed his throat so tightly that the blood flowed freely from his morLth, at the same timo caUing on the other man, an associate, to lend him a hand. The associate, however, darted from the shop, no doubt to keep watch outside. The boy was, of course, completely overpowered, and was al but insensible when a gentleman whose watt-h was being repaired suddenly entered. A glance satisfied him that there was something wrong, and he, with the utmost coolness, closed the shop door, remarking, as he did so that he would keep all in that were in tiU the police were sent for. An officer was promptly in attendance, and the scoundrel was taken to the office. He is unknown to the police, but as they have strong reason to believe, from his demeanour and appearance, that lie is a daDgerous character, we suibjoin a description of himn, which ma~y, Perhaps, lead to some information being obtained regardinyg his past career. He says that his name is David Robison, that he is an engine fitterby trade and a native of Whitby, Westmnorelarid.He isasfow-c;mplexond,fair haired long faced, and his features are surly and forbidding. He is about 24'years of age, and 5 feet 10 inches in height. He is dressed in a blue top coat, brown cloth trousers, black cloth cap, s riped regatta shirt, cottondickey, shoes -with brass eyseletlaoics, and he speak-s with an Englisgh accent. When handcuffe bepresented his wrists with thatI peculiar dash which I's only foun in those who have had experience in weaingthebraeles.When searcbed in the police.omiee he ac1notingin ispockets but a Glengarry beunet. The acco~phic, whodes apedacording to the boy's statement, was tou mae, orea Glengarry, and appeared to be abouti 18 ear ofage Te two were observed loitering about the shopAce duingtheafternoon. Robison is now in the hands of hesheif's ntorities.-GimgoweiVail.

Mr. HOBHOTJSE appeared in support of a petition by Mrs. Dyce Sombre, the administratrix of the personal estate of her late husband, pra7ing the payment out of court of a sum of money standing m the lunacy, and for the txation of certain costs.
Mr. R. STEvres, for the next of kin and the co-heiresses of Mr. Dyce Sombre, did not offer any objection to the application, but asked that some special directions should be given as to title-deeds.
Mr. P. P. Monmiar for M-r. Larkins, asked that before the papers in his hands were delivered over to the committee they mght be examned by the Master in Lumacy, and so arranged that those which were of a private nature might be left in Mr. Larkins's bands. Among the papers, almost innumerable, were letters of Mr. Dyce Sombre, the disclosure of which might bo painful, and could do no good to any one.
Mr. Teed appeared for another party.
Lord Justice K?uGrT BRUCE.-I conclude that their being seen or being kept secret would do no good or harm to any human being. If they were handed over, in all human probability no one would be at the trouble of reading them. Tey might, no doubt, be pasted up at the corner of the street with perfect safety. Why should the Master be troubled-with such a duty ?
Lord Justice TuBRx suggested that tbe papers should be handed over; they might be examined by the party himself, and he might upon afidavit allege what were of a pivate confidential nature, and if the parties differed the master might then decide.
Lord Justice KiNIGT BRUCEB aReed to this, and so the order was made. It was true, said is Lordship, that it was about waste paper, but even waste paper was said to bo of some use.

Mr. Sketchley was the owner of shares in the company, and became bankrupt in June, 1856. In 1851 he deposited various certificates or coupon in the company as a security for 8001. No notice of this transactiox was given to the company, aud the commissioner decided that the shares did not remain in the order aud disposition of the bankrupt, but belonged to the mortgagee, the bankrupt being himself a secretary to the company, to whom, as such, the notice should have been eiven, aud being also the solicitor whose duty it wvas to give thenaotice, the transaction of the deposit was complete.

EXnCX V, KNTOROVICZ (WuLDBEaG GREAT CONWSOU
DATE]) ?AING COrAN'Y).
The VlCn-CarwcmnoR delivered jud gent in this e, which was argued a few days since. Without going Into any lengthened detail of facts, it vill be aufficient, with a view to rendering the case intelligible, to state that the questions arise out of the transactions connected with the original purchase of the Wildberg Mine, now belonging to the above company. This original purchase was negotiated bv yantoroviez as agent for theyproprietors, Messrs. Huns. diecker. Having put himself into communication with certain parties, Messrs. Twynam, Carter, and others, be and they together ultimately agreed to purchase the mine from the Hunsdieckers at, the sum (in round numbers) of 85,000., this being, according to the statement of Kantorovie; the mininamum sum those persons would take. This purchase being completed, the above company was soon afterwards formed, Messrs. Twynam and Carter and the plaintiffs in the present suit being some of the origint promoters. A prospecets was issued, statin
a capital of 14,0001., and also stating that the mine hag been purchased by the company for 125,0001., including a sum for prehiminary expenses and a premium to the ariginal purcbasers (this sum being, of course, the difference between the suum given by the company and the 85,000!. purchase money given by Bantoroviez, Twynam, Carter, &c.). It afterwards transpired that Kantoroviez, on the origial negotiation withthe Hundieckers, bad agreed with them that he should be at liberty to retain for himself any sum which he might obtain for the mine over and above (in round numbers) 63,O0!, and this agement he kept entirely concealed from his co-contractors, who wero led to believe tnat the whole 85,000! (part of which was represented by shares in the subsequently formed company) was to ;o to the Hunsdieckers. Upon this secret agreenment bemg discovered the present suit was instituted in this country for the purpose of obtaining forthe company the benefit of the difference thus sought to be retained by Kanto. roviez. The bill wasfiled bythree of the committee of manageinent of the company on behalf of themselves and allother the shareholders of the company, except such of the defendants as were shareholders therein, and prayed that the appropriation by the defendant Kantorovicz of a certificate, orhiromesse vaction, for 10,725 shares in the company pursuant to the scret arrangement in question mnight be declared a fraud upon the plaintiffs and the other shareholders in the company, and that Eantorovicz was answerable for, and hable to make good to the company, these shares, or the value thereof, and relief was also prayed in respect of costs and damae inured or payable by the plaintiffs and two of the defendats in certain suite whiob had been instituted against them in Prussia by Kantorovicz. Collateral qucstions were raised in this suit and in two others which were heard withit, but these collateral questions are immaterial to be noticed. His Honour said that in the preliminar
negotiations for the sale of the mine it might be assumed, as against the plaintiffs, that Kantorovicz had some interest in the mine. when, howeve., the transaction assumed the shape of a purchase and the final contract was signed the interest of Kantorovicz had entirely ceased, and he was ostensibly in the same position as the urchasers. There had been some agreement between him and the owners that they woluld, be content after taking 63,0001. for the mine, that he should take for himself any surplus that he could get from the company. The deed of purchase was very precise in its terms, and was between the vendors (the Hunsdieckers) of the one part, and the several purchasers of the other part, one of whom was Kantorovicz. The parties were thus put in direct opposition; the vendors affected to act in respect of their own interest, and the purchasers, on the other side, in respect of theirs. Any interest in Kantorovicz was carefullyexcluded from the knowledge of his co-purchasers. He was, in fact, pressed by them to obtain, if possible, a reduction of the purchase money at the very time that he was clearly interested under the secret barnain with the vendors in getting a higher price, and had the same interest with them. lHe had, moreover, uniformly represented to the other defendants acting with him in the purchase that 85,0001. was the minimum price that could be aepted by the owners. It was impossible to hold that Kantorovicz was entitled by virtue of this secret agreement in his own favour to draw out of the Purchase mouey tho 10,000 shares, or 20,000L. Then as to the proceedings in the foreign courts. The Court of Premiare Instance at Cologne had decided that Kantorovicz might retain these shares even. against his co-contractors, but this decision had been reversed by the Court of Appeal, which bad hel4 the secret' agreement as between Kantorovicz and lis co-contractoFs. to be a partnership transaction, in respect .of which be could only retain his (one-fifth) share. A .s between Kanto. rovicz and the company that Court had declinied to interfere on some ground of alienage, and-tbe appeal which was now pending against the reversal of the first decision would. not decide anything between tho companyand-Rantorovicz. Moreover, there was no evidence whatever as to the precise questions that were raised in these forei suitdts. What this Court had now to decide was whether a fraud had been committed on thecompany? The case was, no doubt, very peciu liar. It w as admitted on allhands that the mine wasa really. valuable property, and.thedefendant Kantorovicz4contended that the companyr had bought the mine at afairpie* o exceeding its vadue, and therefore that there coiuld. not have been any fraud up,on the shareholders. There was
some meagreness of evidence, but it had net heen alleged,
nlEwheeSbatisthadeverbet,rnprcsentedthatthepremium, or erence bitt'eenthe pnioe gyen by the company and tbeoriginalporbae amounted to 30,M only. But an injoei e been dob6 to the compinr 'by their giving a pnce fora thing which badl cost so much less. Two of the original purchasers&,,essrs. Twnam and Carter, had aLso a4edas agentalor and in the promotion of the compan; mnd in that capacity they were bound to mnake, and the shareholders might naturally look to them to make, the best bargain they cotld. This they had dbne by paying (as they supposed) a premium of about 30,000t. over the original purnciaso money. On tho whole, the Court must come to the conclusion tbatthe promesmed7adiion, beihg as it wa3 clearly on every pinciple by which this Court is goverred, a frauu by Kantorovicz on his co-contractors, was also a fraud on the company. Hlis Honour then made a decree in accordance with this decision.
FRPP V. THE BRTDOGWATUR AND TAtSU'Ox CASAL
COMUANY AND STOLFOPD RAlLWAY AND HARBOUR COMPANY.
In the conrse of the arguments of this came, which are stll ceeding, and threaten to occupy the Court for some days The VICE-CHANCELLOR observed that he had received more papers of the same nature as those already alluded to. If they were the production of Mr. Selfe, of Bridgewater, the person whose name was signed to them, he hoped the friends of that per.on would take some steps to prevent the repetition of suci conduct. If he persisted in it some more serious notice must be taken, for it was a manifest contempt of Court thus to presume to interfere with the administration of ustice. As to the rabbish itself, it had better be thrown into the fire, the fittest place for such stuff.

(Before Dr. LUSmIIN(aTANN
This was an action brought by Her Majesty's ship Melampus against the American vessel Ticonderop, to recover the loss arising from a collision between them in the Golden Horn, Constantinople, at 5p.m. on the 27th of July, 1855. The Melwanpus was I2'ing at anchor with her jibboom rigged in to prevent accident, when the Ticonderogs, in tow of the steamer Sea Nymph, came athwart hawse of her, doing her considerable damage. The Ticonderoga, in her defence, alleged that she was m the service of the French Government; tbat the SeaNymph was attached to bex by order of the French Intendant; and that she was towed against the 3elampus by the Sea Nymph, for which, under the circumstances, she was not responsible.
ThO. Quzmi's ADVOCATE and the A bIALTY ADVOCATE were heard for the Melampus; Dr. ADDASs and Dr. Twissfor the Ticonderoga.
The learned JUDGE pronounced against the Ticonderoga, with costs.
THE HAPRIETT-SALVAGE.
This was an appeal from a decision of the magistrates at Maidstone in a cause of salvage. On the 9th of December last the bahge Brriett, timber laden, was, as alleged on the one hand, but denied on the other, in a state of great danger, in consequence of a storm, near the Nore Sand. The smack Leader went to her aid, and conducted her to a place of sfety. The salvors claimed 801., but the magis. trates allowed 151. only, against which the salvors instituted thissppeal.
Dr. A?DDAs was heard for the appellants; Dr. BATFOnD for the respondents.
The learned JuDGE thought that the magistrates had grossly miscarried in their award; he therefore overraled it, and decreed 40., with costs.
THE PRPnTXSS ROYAL-SALVAGF.
This was a suit promoted by three smacks, a lugger, and a barge against the Princess Royal to procure salvage remuneration for services rendered to ier on the 7th of October last and following days The Princess Royal, bound from Leith for London with a cargo of general merchandise, struck on the edge of the Nore Sand, where she bumped heavily. The wmd was blowing hard with a strong sea. The aalvors came up at differeen times, and ccordmg to their account were engaged in pumping and lightening the vessel. After great exertions and considerable danger arisng from the quantity of gunpowder on board, the vessei was got afoat, and with the asistance of two steamers safel conducted to London. The steamers accepted 2501. for their services, and the owners tendered the salvors 3001L, which they refused. The value of the property salved was about4,0001.
Dr. ADDAmS and Dr. Twiss were heard for the salvors; the QuEEN's ADvocATE and Dr. BAYBORD for the owners.
The CoUxRT pronounced for the tender, with costs.

Mr. ASPND for the assignees opposed, and tho proof wa reserved for consideration.
hfr. M&s.oos.~i on behalf of Mr. lIarding, the official manager, tendered a proof for 1,2001. in respect of a alU of fl0t. per share.
The bankrupt, it appeared, had been settled as a contributory by Mr. Pugh, the Chief Clerk in the Vice-Chancel-
The CosMussToNx doubted whether the Chief Clerk eould judicially dispose of such a matter.
Mr. DORIA bore testimony to the practice in the Vice. CbanceUores Chambers for the Chief Clerk to dispoe of minor details in cases like that before the Court.
Mr. ASPLAD contended that neither the order nor the cal had come under the cognizance of the Vice-Chancellor ; that the call was wholly void and that the list of contributories must be settled by the Vice-Chancellor himself.
Mr. Lcos.z admitted his inability to cite any precedent, and
His HoNoun directed that a representation of the facts should be made to Vice-ChanceUor Kindersley; in the meantime consideration of the proof would be adjourned.
IN RE WIGNEY.
The bankrnpt was a printer and engraver of Brighton, and the editor of the 7ashionaMbZ Arrfrals List.
This was the certificate meeting.
It wfas alleged that the bankrupt would have been solvent but for his having given abiUl of sale to Messrs. Tooth;* and
His HoNouR having remarked that Messrs. Tooth wfonlJ appear to have taken all the teeth out of the banrpt's head (a. laugh), an adjournment wvas ordered, to see If the assignees could recover any part of the valuable property.

The bankrupts were lozenge manufacturers in Cranecourt, Eleet-street.
A proof was tendered against the estate by Mr. Peck on behalf of a creditor who, it was sated, had charged 20 per cent. interest for accommodation.

This insolvent, who had been a corn and co--I dealer at Mortlake, was opposed by M{r. Browne for Mr. Palmer, a surgeorn at Mor e, andm by Mr. Macrae for two creditors named Downes and Giles.
Mr. Palmer had brought an action for slander against the insolvent, whom he bad attended for a fractured ann. A verdiot by consent for 40s. was taken after several wit. nes.O had been examined, and the costs were upwards of 501. The insolvent before the trial, but after the writ in the action, made a bill of sale of his property to one of his principal creditors, and had since caried on the business for the creditors, who now refused to share the pro. perty with the other creditors.
Mr. MACR&A submitted that the insolvent had given a preference, and asked the Court to order the property to be MrT.10&owNz prayed a judgment for the damages and costs in the action which was brought for the vindication of Mr. Palmer's character as a surgeon.

Elijah Ramsey, 26, and John Cutting, aliaJ Catten, 50, wereo hard with ? burglary in the iwellinghouse of John Bazzib&ls trigglesworth.
Mr. Shaw prosecuted.
The prosecutor in this ase is an aged man, a fanner at a p)ace called Rarnaden Reilbonse, in this county, and it appeared that on the nigh of the 26th of Dccember his house was broken open and a considerable quantity of pro. pe,ty stolen, one of the articles taken being a pistoL Both pnsoners wren sn on the morning aftr the robbery, eacb carying a large bundle, about Esi miles from the prosecutor's residenoe; and on the same day Howard, an inspector of the esex onsWtbulary, went to a publichouse at bMucking, and in a stable belonging to it he found the prisoner Cutting alseep, arid upon rousing and searching him he found that he had on a greatcoat that belonged to 'ir. Wrigglesworth, and it his pockets were found a great number of articles that had been stolen. The constble was then about to take charge of tho prisoner, when he observed him put his hand into his pocket, and, suspecting that he had some weapon there, he seized his hand and he discovered that he had a loaded pistol in his pociet, and upon a further search he found a black veil, intended, no doubt, for the purpoe of disguise. The other prisoner, Ramsey, was found 2n a oottge at Grays Thurrock, that was occupied by Cutting, and in his possession there were found other portions of the stolen property, and also the pistol that had been taken from the prosecutor's, which at thst time vas unloaded, but which was now discovered to be charged with powder and shot.
The prisoners in their defence said that they had bought the articles found in their possession of a strange man, sad Cutting said that the pistol had been lent to him for the purpose of shooting a rabbit, and he denied having ay intention to use violence towards the officer.
Be j found both prisoners Gziltv.
There were five other indictments ror burglary against them, and Ramsey was proved to have been convicted of burgly in 1850, aud sentenced to bo transported for 15 years.
Mr. Justice CRZSSWxLL, in PaSsing sentence, observed upon the very serious and aLarning character of theirerime, and said that with respect to Ramsay, who had already been convicted of burglary and sentenced to transportation, he ecold niot understand how such a man was at large, but he supposed he had succeeded in imposing upon some person who had recommended him to the clemency of the Crown. It was elear, however, that he was perfectly incorigible, and the sentence, therefore, he felt it his duty topass uponhimwasthathebetransportedforlife. Asto the other prisoner, he said it was imposible to doubt that if the officer had not been too quick for him ho would have made use of the loaded pistol that was found in his po
seWsion. The sentence upon him therefore would bo one of transportation for 20 yeas
James Coopr, Egmiont Hoof, and Alfred Hoof, three fashionably young men, and who -were stated to be possessed of considerable property, surrendered to take their trial upon a chargo of assaulting John George.
The defendants were origina committed upon a chargo of manslaughter, but the grand jury ignored the bill, and returned one for a common assault only.
MT. Rodwell ad Mr. Leek conducted the prosecution; Mr. E. James, QC., Mr. Hawkins, and Mr. Poland appeared for Cooper; and kr. Bodkin appeared for the two
This charge arose out of a most disgraceful act committed by the defendants at Brentwood last August. The prosecutor, or rather It should be xaid the deceased, for his death followed the treatment he received upon the occasion, was a respectable man, who carried on the business of a baker at Brentwood, and he ha let a stable to the defendants Alfred and Egmont Hoof, and on the 21st of Augnst he went there or some purpose, and theyinvited him to drink wine, and in the first instnce two bottles were sent for. More wine was afterwards brought, and the defendants, who were al present, pled the unfortunate man with liquor until he became in alhelpless state of intoxication, and while he was in this oondition they pratised the most disgusting indignities upon his person, and eventaally covered nearly the whole of Ins body with red ochec, snaking a mark across his throat as though it had been cut. A wheelbarrow was then obtained, on which the unfortunate man was placed, with his head hAnging down between tbe handles, and his legstover the wheels, and he was wbeeled along the High-street of Brentwood in this state to the house where he resided. HIewas unconscious for several hburs, and died e ry shortly afterwards fromeongestion of' the brain and lungs, the effects no doubt of the quantity of liquor he had taken, but which was in all probability aggra'ated by the position ia which he was placed in the wheelbarrow. The ooroner's jury returned a verdict that thedeceased died from natural causes, but the magistrates of the district took up the matter, and committed the defendants upon a charge of manslaughter, and they were held to bail to answer that chare.
These facts were proved in evidence, and the widowr of tbe deceased, a very respectable looking person, described the condition in which her unfortunate husband was brought home on the evening in question. It also appeared that while the poor man was being wheeled home the wife was sen to come out of her house, and the defendant Cooper upon seeing her exclaimed to his companions, "THere comes his- wife."
Nione of the learned counsel for the defendants put any question to the witnesses, and when the evidence had been gone through Mr. JAES asked his Lordship whether ho consideredahat, under the circumstances, and taking into consideration the fact that all the parties appeared to have been driuning together, and there being nothing to show that the deceased objected to what was done, the placing the ochre upon his person constituted an assult. -
Mr. Justice CRBSSWLL said, in his opinion, in law it certainly did.
Mr. Jss then said they were not in a condition to disputethe facts, andhemust therefore oonsent to z verdict of gauity.
The jury accordingly found all the defendants Guilty of a common assault.
His LOsDsmp immediately ordered the defendants, who had been allowed to stand on the floor of the court during the trial, togo into the dock.
Mr. JAxSo and Mr. BODNr addressed his Lordshin in mitigation of punishment, and urged the youth of tbeidefendants-the two Hoofs being only 18 and 19 years old, and Cooper being also a very younz man-as an excuse for their conduct They said that tRiey deeply regretted the consequences of the indiscretion they had committed, and hoW that the fact of their baving had a charge of Manslaughter hanging over their heads for so many months, and the great eynse they had been put to in the matter, would be taken iUto consideration by his Lordship in giving Judgment.
Iir. Justice CRwSSWXLL, in passing sentence, said he should endeavour to prevent any prejudice that might be created in his mind by the fatal result of the diWsraceful conduct of the defendants from operating npon him in passing sentence, and he should merely punish them for tbe offence of which they bad 'been convicted-namely, that of common assault.' Their cnduct had been most disgraceful. Not content with the indignities they had practised upon the unhappy man, it was 'evidently their intention to exppsehiminthe town, and to make it appeat that he bad committed some violence upon himself, and that they sent him home in t-hat sate, utterly re-
the consequences' to his wife and family.
robably consider imprisonment a disgrace and degradtion, but it *ppeared to him that it was not at all equal to the degradation they had brought upon themselves 'by their conduct in this transaction. He then sentenced them to be imprisoned in the common gaol of the cpunty for one month.
The defendants, who evidently had not the least idea that they should have to undergo imprisonment, appeared quite astounded at the sentence.

Mr. Mellor, QC., and Mr. Bell appeared for tbo plaintiff; Mr. Macaulay, Q.C., and 11r. Merewether for the defendant,
This was an action brought to recover compensation in damages for an' wur vwhic the plaintiff had Eustained in consequenoo of puttmg his hand upon some explosive instrument set in tho de endant's gaden. The plaintiff had formerly carried on busines as a horse-dealer, but becaune insolvent about two yeres ago, and had since been living at Wymeswold, near to the house and gardens of Captain Dawkins, the defendant, At the beginniDg of last September, on a Saturday evening, the laintiff missed a black bantam cock, ana supoin t to a strayed into the defendant's gxrdens went totbe defendant and asked his permission to go into the garden to search for it. This permunis%io was granted, andtbe earch was made in the presence of the defendant, bat the fowl was not found. On the followin
Monday evening, about 9 o'clock, the plaintiff, accompaid. by ajoungman, wentsagain, after the defendant's gateswere c oee in search of the bantamn and obtained an entrancs into his garden tbroughithe premises ef a neighbour, whence, by means of a ladder, they could descena into one part of the defendant's garden. While the plaintiff was eeling about, and was stooping down to look uonder the trees, be placed his handuon some instrument which exploded with a loud report and ijrured his hand and one eye. Some of these instruments were produced in court, and appeared to consist of a nnall box faled with gunpowder, to which a spring was attached, so that upon the pressureof the sprine tne gunpowdor would explode. Afterthe accident had happened the plaintiff went to surgeon, who treated %he matter very lightly, and told him to batbe his eye with warm water; bUt on the following day he consulted another medical man, who hadjprevioust attendod him, and he stated that the plaintiff h ered considerably from the shock for rome week and that though the inflammation in hix. eye had subsided there were still some particles of powder in it. S
Upon cross-examination the plaintiff admitted that he was aware before he went into the garden that there wero explosive instruments set in the garden, as it was talked of in the village, and he had often heard the reports, but he thovght they wore only set to destroy cats and dogs.
Mr. MAcDuLAY submitted that tbo plaintiff must be non. suited. The action was founded upon the statute 7th and 8th George IV., c.18, s. 1, which provided that if any person ahould set any spring-gun, man-traT, or other engine calculated so destoy human life, or inflict grievous bodily harm, with intent that the sAme, or whereby the same, might destro or inilict grievous bodily harm uLpon a trespassek or oTher person comin i contact therewith, t

PRICE V. };ILPI.
Mr. Eeating, Q. C., and Mr. }luddleston appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Phipson for the defendant.
This was an action in which the plaintiff, Benjamin Price, an-Oxford tailor, sought to recover the sum of 581. 5s., being the amount ofthe plaintiff'sbill for clothes supphed to the defendant and to various other parties on the defendant's order. The defendant paid 451. into court, and denied his liability beyond that sum. The defendant, Charles James Kilpin, was a gentleman living at St. Micbael's Mount, Hastings, and he appeared to have indulged in a very unusual species of generosity, which consisted in giving away new suits of clothes to persons who managed to secure his favour. These persons were cabmen, grooms, railway porters, waitess at hotels, and people of that class, who from time to time obtained written orders from the defendant addressed to the plaintiff, requesting him to furnish the parties with suits of clothes suitable to their station in life. There waas no question as to the defendant's liability, but be disputed the amount charged as being excessive. The suits varied in pnce from 41. 15s. to 61. It appeared that after the plaintiff nad sent in his account the defendant had twice promised to pa the amount-.
Mr. Justice WILLnS thereupon asked the defendant'. ,counsel how he could defend the action after the defendaut had twice promised to pay the bill, and had invited the plaintiff to dinner?
Mr. PHiPSON said his case was that, though the defendant bad been eccentric enough to give these orders, the plaintiff had charged exorbitant, St. James's-street prices.
Mr. Justice WiLLS said he did not think that the learned counsel could get a suit of clothes in St. James'sstreet for 41. 15s. (Laughter.) Iis Lordship added that he thought the learned counsel would not stand much chance with the jury, and, as the jury intimated that they had no doubt about the case, a verdict was taken for the plaintiff for the full amount claimed.

In the course of the day the grand jury, having dispoeed of all their other business, made a presentment, in which they complained that two indictments found at the last snmmer assizes in July, 1856, against the surveyors of the highways for the non-repair of a highway near Oktbht& had not yet been brought down for trial. The presentment stated that the road in question, the Lower London-road, leading from Oxford, was In a very dangerous state, that many accidents hsd already taken place, and that more were expected, and that they (the grand jury) as "uardiaus .- the public interest, felt it to be their du8ty bring the TmU,r before the Court.
'Mr. Justice CRO0VDiR taid he quite agreed with the grand jury that the cicumstance was much to be regretted, but he was informed by the officer of the Court that the delay arose from the circumstance that the cc-tiorari to remove the indictmentb had not been apphed for in time to givethe necessary notices for trial. His Lordship was sorry that he could not render any ssistance.
John Wiggins, aged 46, labourer, and James Harris, aged 21, labourer, were charged with burglariously breaking and entering a dwellinghouse and stealing a watch and other articles, the property of Mary Augusta Surtees, at Littlemnore, on the 9th of February, 1857.
Mr. A. S. Hill appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Sawyer defended Harris; the other prisoner was undefended.
It appeared that, on the night in question, the house in which two ladies, Miss Surtees and Miss Scott, lived, 'was broken open and a number of articles were stolen. From the traces of footmarks in the garden and in the house two persons must have been concerned in the robbery; and it appeared that they had lighted a candle, 'which had been left in the kitchen the night before, and burnt it for a considerable time. The ladies, however, were not disturbed by any noise or violence. The next day the prisoner Harris was at Oxford, distant 2.1 miles, and offered a watch to a pawnbroker for sale, and represented that it had been left to him by his grandfather. This state.
nent was corroborated by the other prisoner Wigeins. Tho pawnbroker was not satisfied, and said he would lend os. on the watch and make inquires of the police. Notwith. standing this threat, the prisoner Harris afterwards retumed, and got a further sum of l5s.on the watch. Both the prisoners at that time 'were very drunk, and in that state they went to a publchouse, where Harris sold the duplicate to the landlord for 10s. Wbile at the publichouse the police caine and found on Harris a handkerehief, a match-box, a box of steel pens, and some sealing wax, but they found nothing on WiggiDs. Barris stated that he had received the things, but he would mot split. Miss Surtees identified the handkerchief and match-box as her property, and stated that the 'watch had been lent to her by Mlr. Huntingford, the clergyman of Littlemore, and that they were all safe on the might the house was broken open.
Mr. SAWVYER addressed the jury for Harris, and contended that his conduot at the pawnbroker's was inconsistent with guilt.
The jury, after consderable hestation, Acquitted WigSins, and found Harris Guilty of receiving the property, knowving it to have been stolen.'
Mr. Justice CROIVDER said that if the jury had -convicted Harris of the burglary he snould have passed a very heavy sentence upon him, as crimes of that natiire lad been very frequent in that and the adjoining counties; but for the offence of which he had been convicted the sentenea would be 12 months' imprisonment with hard labour.

The Board Of Trade Returns.
* THE BOARD OF TRADE BETURNS.
TO TEHE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,- The commercial publc owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. FonbIanque, of the statistical department of the Board of Trado, for the great improvenmenta he is annually making in the accounts published by the Board.
While congratulating him, however, upon the increased usefulness of these returns, in consequence of their more business-like arrangement, I cannot permit the opportunity to pass without frankly stating that much has yet to be done to make them really useful to the merchant.
As I stated in a former letter to you, which you were good enough to publish in January, 1856, these monthly returns should represent the quanti-.s and value of our imports, as well as the quantities and value of our exports, the countries whence received, and to where exported, so that a regular debtor and creditor account could be kept of our commerce with each nation or country.
Now, it appears to me that it would be a very easy matter for the statistical department of this board to keep a debtor and creditor account something similar to the follow1ng:
xnjese ±igues are roughly taken fromu the annual statisticii atatemenit, and are mnerely given as a speciment of the
:form I 'would take the libertY of recoinmending.
in the AbOre form a regular account current, as it were, *would be kept, by whchx could be ascertained at a glanice theexat oelio ofBrtis cmmecewith each nationa deideatum yo wil adit,of heghiest importance, not only in a individuaj bof view.

UtVEMroN AND LANCASTER.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held on Tuesday at ulverstone, Mr. A. Brogden in the chair.
The HATRM", in mCIvinz the a'option of the report, stated he trusted and believed that before the next halfyearly aeeting the line would be opened and the shareholders bave the pleasure of coming to the meeting over their own line. The greatest possible exertions had been made to secure the opening of the line in May, and if the weather were favourable that result might be accomplished. This line was evidently a great public necessity, as the U1verstone ores were in even greater demand than ever they had been, and during the last year 430,000 tons had been X aased within the district of Furness,and the whole of this, or even more, could find a market with rrorr railway facilties in Staffordshire, Yorkcshire, and theiIddleborough districts. 2Ihe opening of this railway would prove of great value to
teiron manufa^tures of the country, and he did not doubt th.at a large traffic would pass over the line. They hadnot e' ecided on any further reclamation works during the past six months, but the attention of the directors would be
iven to those operations very shortly, and they were much sncouraged by the results already obtained.
The report was adopted and the meeting separated.
BIMENHEAD, LANCASHIRE, AND CHESHIRE.
At the adjourned meeting of this company on Wednesday the scrutineers reported thbt there was a majority of 2,374 votes, representing 34M,5471 stock, in favour of Mr. TaunI on's amendment, which was to the effect " that the meet ing, having a fnUl regard to the inproved position of the company since Mr. Atkinson's election to the chair, approve the managemenf adopted by him, and hope that Mr. Titherington and the board will pursne the same course."
A long discussion ensued, wLi0h ended, without any praectical result, by the separation of the meeting.
VALE OF TOWY.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at Llandovery, on Saturday- Air. R Thomas presided.
The CHAULme read tle report, which congratulated the shareholders on the advaneed position of their works and onthe satisfactoryarrangementswhichthey had made for a speedy opening of the line for traffic. At a meeting held at Llandovery on the 12th of November, 1856, the shareholders gave their consent to the terms of an agreement for a lease of the line to Messrs. McLean and Robertson, such terms having been unanimously agreed upon by the directors at a meeting of the hoard held at Carmarthen on the 21st of October, 1856. Tbe arrangement, however, came to an abrupt termination, in consequence of a proposal by the intended lessees to insert in the bill a condition whollyst variance with the agreement-viz., a power to determine the lease at any time thelessees might think proer, or the forfeiture of 5,0001.
The CHAIRMAN, in moving the adoption of the report, said the shareholders had every reason to congratulate themselves on the advanced progress of the works, and, owing to the valuable services rendered throughout by their secretary, thev were in a position very nearly and almost entirely within the original scope of the company to open the line to Ilandovery.
Hr. W. REEs, seconded the motion, whieh was carried nes, con.
The CXMAnTZ said, with respect to the ease between the company and Major Riee, he thought they were exceed. ingly indebted to their solicitor for the great ability and address displayed by him in the conduct of this case. He bad to contend with Sir Fitzroy Kelly and 31r. Lloyd, Q.C., and, instead of availing himself of the servioes of other eminent counsel, which would have entailed upon the company very heavy expense, Mr. Bishop, withthe sanction of althe directors, undertook to oppose those gentlemen. He (the chairman could say, being hineself present at the hearng, that the company had lost nothing whatever by the confidence they had reposel in their solicitor.
IIn reply to Mr. F. Lews the SECRE'rty statod that the line might be opened for traffic before the lat of Jdly.
A vote of thanks to the chairman concluded the proceedi-
ings.

Witchcraft In The Nineteenth Century.-
WnTCHCRAI-T D T EE NEmM'H COu'TURY.- Rugeley-rendered famous by Palmer's crimes-has been a scene of great excitement for several days past, reminding one of the time when the inquests on Palmer's victims were being held, in consequence of a solemn investigation before a le bench of magistrates into the circumstances of a case of alleged witchcraft. The reader on becoming acquainted with the facts of the case will almost fancy that he is reading a history of doings in the dark ages, and not of proceedings which have of a truth taken place in this day of borsted lght and knowledge. The history of the case is riefy this:-A young and apparently respectable farmer, named Thomas Charlesrorth, resides on a smaU farm of his own at Bromley Hurst, near Rugeley. Some 16 m'.nths back he married a young woman in his own station of life, but the marriage displeased his widowped mother, who uween living with him, and she left, cantioning him however, before her departure not to attempt to make cheese, as it would be sure to tumble to pieces Heedless ofthewidow's caution, cheese-akingas prosecuted, but wth ittle or no success, the ml refusing to turn, or, if a cheese p erchance were made, it acertain to hl to pieces The farmer and his wife were ill, and the daithmd also was unwbell, wthout any 6otensible canse The farmer coupled these twings with his e other's prediction, and came to the conclusion that he was "bewitched." Bemoaninghis condi
tion to a neighbour, Sammols, a tolg pe-keepere and who at times vorked on the farm, 8ammons recommended him to go to a rise man, James Tunnicliff, also living in the neighbourhood, ho " could do anything." The fanmer and his wife immediately set off to Tunnichiff's house, and fortnnately for them, as he said, found him at home. The cause of their journey told, Tnnnichiffproffered his services to relieve them of the dire c&lamity under wrhich they were EnErn n next morning be made his appearance on the farm Without seeing the cows he pronounced them bewiikhed, and the cheese kettle he declared to have fallen under the same curse. He could remove the enchantment, butmoneywouldbe neeessary,and forthwiththesimple farmer paid him 5s. for himself,s each for some horses, rSe for the cheese kettle, and Ss. 6d. each for the cows, in all amountinto about 7l7, for removing the spelL Things however, did not mend at the farm; on the contrary, the wife was occasionaly seized with sicknem, the husband suffered from unaccountable aches and pains, especialUy after Tunnicliff had been on the farm, and at might there were mysterious noises, accompanied by the shaldnf of the house, bellowing of t e cattle, howling of dogs &ec. ALpeAtionwas gain made to Tunnicliff, who represented the at3te of the farmer and his wife, and the extraordinary noims, to have arisen from the "w idow's curse," and theenehantmentpot upon themthrough her instrumentality bq wiarisds iwing at Longton, Buton-on.Trent, and Derby. Mfore noney was required to remove the enchantment and te paJ the expense of the journeyings to the izards- Cbarlesworth freely parted with his money to thoanwct ot 301., but the farmer and his wife derived no benefit from the expenditure, TnnnicEff at length went X live on the farm, and resided with the farmer and his wife everal months, during ,which period he wa engaged at istrstvals in making crosses on all the doors with witch hazd, and in burning blue and other lights to overcome the power of those who had bewitched the farmer and his wife. Things went on in this way from April, last yer, u.ntil February last, when at length the zuspicion arose tt TnielHws contributin to their illness by drugging them, rnd that the extr n 5ri noises about the pseix were 06ionoa by hrm. UIetitY TunniEff was ot st bout U dbs Usins
