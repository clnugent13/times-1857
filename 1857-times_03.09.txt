I belleve that the Igoore of Conimon, astat present conigtituted, does not represent the n-ol'ls of this cOuntry ; esery measure, therefore. -whichi has for its objetT to miake it more completely the Commons' House. would receive ivy axdenlt support.
In myij opiniion this obj,,ct caunot be effected by any sdingle mnexasrs. We must have the vote 1y ballot. a sbortetneu of the duration of Par' lisinvute. a large extei',lou of the suiffrage. an-d a re-distribution of oar elect,yral eistriete, which would imolve sthe remuoval of that anomaly hi

ThisGoampa tIsformed with itted liability, nusder the p revisions ofte"JitSokCopnolAt &, frtepv of bringing into general use Boydel aten tation Engine and Endless Railway.
For this object conditional arrangements (which maybe scertained upon applcation to the Secretory) have been entered tno for the pus.r chase of the patent right for Great Britain &and Ireland and the Channel XIsands which, while adIvantageous to the shareholders,wil miako the remuneration for is in a greet mewasre dependent on the success of the undertaking.
This invention is of national importance, as It reMOves the only difficulty hitherto experienced in making steam traction profitably avallable, beth upon commaon roads and for agricultural purposes.
The working and the power of the T'raction Engine anid Endiess Rall. way on common roads haLve been- fully and satisfactorily tested at Wcolichbefre aComitte apoined y te Government, and also at oherDIsos,andthofolowig Iporantresults obtained-viz,
Frr aultursoperations the experiments have proed if posible even more satisfactory, inasmuch as land loughed at Gifieront plaoes
in the nresene of a very large number of practical asriculturhst, ha been pronounced by them to have been better dOne than by horse
while the rsaing of cost has been variously estimated from f0t(o 70 nw
cent., cording to the descripton of the wrork done, and pieseing tois toeat advantage, that, in loughing on softer wet ground, the Endless lall,7 and a nUae do in "lelYlessharm tothe land t theihorses'
tin drawing the plodgh Poughing to a depth almost Imposible to ascomptati by ersets. has been both efficently and economicaily performed by meanus of this invention.
The Endless Raiway, when worked by homes, i scarcely of le Imortanc, as the power requisite to draw wlaggons and carts fitted with itOer soft ground and badm reeds wdi in all cases be Im mensely diminishled, and Ibey can be taken over land where, wvithout It, it would be timpossible to draw them by horse-powecr, on account ofteirEfgn

In the discount-market and at the Bank there continues to be a full demnand for money at the txisting rates.
Foreign securities have been steady, and the transactions generally were limited. Turkish Six per Cents., for the account, were negotiated at 961 and 97i, and the Four per Cents.

The railway meetings of the week have been numerous, but have principally comprised secondary undertakings. The shareholders of the Uliverstone and Lancaster Company bave adopted the report detailing progress, and it is expected the line will be opened i June. At the Yale of Towy meeting the directors reported the forwardness of thevworks and the arrangements for a speedy commencement of traffic. The dividend recoramended by the Caledonian and Dumbartonshire report is at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum leaving a balance of 3791. At the meeting of the ihncaster and Carlisle Company the dividend was at the rate of 8 per cent. per annum, and it was stated that the workinor expenses during the half-year have not exceeded 387 per cent. The reportof theLeominster andKington Companyimentions that the contractorshave engaged to open the line throughout next May. According to the report of the Carlisle and Silloth Railway, theline has been in operation four months, and the traffic, although not fully developed, shows satisfactory results. The dividend of the North British Company will be at the rate of 2i per cent. on the ordinary stock, leaving a balance of about 4,0001. At the lancashire and Yorkshire meeting a dividend of 21. 1Os. per share on the 1001. shares, together with the respective amounts on the guaranteed shares, was confirmed. The report of the Blackburn Company ccmplains of the conduct of the Lancashire and Yorkshire directors, particularly in reference to the agreement lately entered into by the latter with the ELast Lancashire Company for an amalgamation. The statement of the Warrington and Stockport Company has been adopted, and under the arrangement with the South Junction and Altrinchan Company the working expenses have been considerably reduced. The Stockport branch, which has been the cause of a portion of the heavy expenditure, has been abandoned. With a steady developement of traffic a dividend, it is still hoped, may be declared. The dividend of the Norfolk Railway Company of 2 per cent. for the halfyear upon the ordinary stock has been confirmed, although the arrangement of the accounts by the Eastern Counties directors is not considered wholly Fatisfactory. The report of the Eastern Union Company has been agreed to, and in this case also there are disputes with the Eastern Counties in relation to several financial points. At the Lowestoft and Beccles meeting it was announced that the works are progressing, and that the land has been arranged for. The report of the Great Southern and Western Railway has been adopted, and the directors have been authorized to raise a sum of 250,0001. for carrying out additional works and providing an increase of rolling stock. The dividend, at the rate of 6 per cent. on the ordinary shures, was agreed to. The Wimbledon and Croydon dividend is 4s. per share, being at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum for the half-year. The report of the Forest of Dean Central Railway details preliminary progress, and it is expected that the line will be completed to Moseley-green by the end of the year. At the East Suffolk meeting the report was carried. The line has advanced during the last five months, and if the Tilbury, Maldon, and Colchester Bill shall receive Parliamenatary sanction this route will, it is believed, contribute largely to an increase of traffic. The report of the Waveney Valley Company states that the new arrangements by the Eastern Counties Railway have interfered with their revenue, and that the directors have not yet received any statement from the latrcmsuA
the working of the last nix months. The preference dividend of 5 per cent. on the Hereford, Ross, and Glocester Railway has been declared, and the unsatisfactory position of the company is attributed to the expenses connected with the purchase of land and engineerirg works having exceeded the
original estimates. The shareholders of the Sunderland Dock have authorized the payment of the various preference dividends, and the revenue
during the half-year has inreased 4,5001. The North Yorkshire And Cleveland report has been agreed to, and the line from Picton to Stokesley
as been completed. The directorshave made teuporary arrangements with the North-Eastern and West Hartlepool companies for a supply of locomotive power and working stock. The report of the
t Ileetwood, Preston, and We8t Ridin Junction
Railway announces that the Preston and Longridoe Railway has recently been purehased, and that the net revenue from the working of the two lines for six months will suffice to meet the interest on the purchase, including interest on the loan. The traffil is now expetd to be further developed. The directors of the Exeter and Exmouth Railway are in negotiation with the Bristol and Exeter Company: with a view of obtaining a gua-
rahtee, and the result will be communi,cted
to a special meeting. The Vale of Neath Rail-
vay is considered in asatisfactory position, and; the dividend, at the rate of 4* per dent. per annum, has been carried. The prospects of the Whitehaven and Furness Junction Company have improved through new sources of traffic, and the directors shortly expect to pay a dividend on the whole of the preference shares. At the Cork and Youghal meeting it was stated that the progresa of works is steady but slow, and the directors urge the payment of arrears of calls, to place them in a situation to complete the line from Middleton to Dunkettle. The report of the Newry, Warrenpoint, and Rostrevor RIailway has been adopted. and an arrangement has been made with the Neviry and Enniskillon Coinpany which will prove mutually beneficial. The dividend of the Belfast and County Down Railway is los. per share, and the traffic has exhibited a steady increase. At the Waterford and Limerick meeting the report was adopted, and the accounts, notwithstanding competition, exhibit encouraging results. A negotiation has been opened with the Great Western Company to eflect an amicable arrangement. The dividend of5s. per share has been confirmed. According to the report of the Newry and Enniskillen directors the
financial position of the company is not encouraging, i but it is thought that it can be satisfactorily ad- i justed. It appears that the efforts of Mr. Ricardo
to assist the Metropolitan Company have been un- I successful, and that the question of winding up has been raised. The report and accounts have been adopted, and in the course of the next six months some definite proposal wiUl be submitted. The Mid-Kent (Bromley to St. Mary Cray) report has been approved, and the provisional agreement with the South-Eastern Company for working the line was rejected. The report of the East Kent Railway has been agreed to, and the proposed route from Strood to St. Mary Cray will, it is said, be a valuable adjunct. The dividend of the Whitehaven Railway has been declared at the rate of 7s. per share, and, while the revenue has increased, the expenditure has been kept within due bounds. The working agreement between the Whitehaven, Cleator, and Egremont and the Whitehaven and Furness Junction Companies has been sanctioned by the Board of Trade. The dividend on the former is at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum. At the meeting of the Bristol and Exeter Company a dividend at the increased rate of 5 per cent. per annum was declared, the revenue presenting satisfactory results. Assistance is to be given to the directors of the Cornwall Railway to enable them to complete the undertaking, as the development of the traffc will be advantageons to the Bristol and Exeter Company. The revenue of the South Devon Company has increased. A dividend at the rate of 12s. 6d. per 501. share has been declared. At the Somerset Central meeting the dividend at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum was carried, the report being approved. An extension to Braton wiU be commenced early in the spring. The arrangements to increase the trafflic of the Newport, Abergavenny, bnd Hereford Company are making progress, and the line from Crumlin to the Taff Vale Junction will be completed in August. The South Yorkshire dividends, at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum on the guaranteed and ordinary shares, have been declared, and the principal discussion' referred to the coal traffic. The dividend of the
Hull and Holderness Railway has been declared atl! the rate of 4 per cent. per annum. At the Birken-
head, Lancashire, and Cheshire Junction meeting,1 the dividend, at the rate of 3j per cent., was con firmed, and the report adopted The shareholders of the Shrewsbury and Welshpool Railway have been reminded of the necessity of raising the re-
mainder of the capital, in order that the directors I may be in a position to proceed with the undertak- I ing in the present year. The report of the Border Counties Company states that a considerable portion of the permanent way between Hexham and Cunkirk is finished, and that preparations are making for setting out the next section from Barrowford to Billingham. The West Hartlepool dividend is at the rate of 4i per cent. per annum, and that of the Taff Vale at the rate of 8 per cent. It appears by the Worcester and Hereford report that the land purchases are being arranged, and that the works on the line near Malvern have been recommencel. The report of the Railway Passengers Assurance Company has been received as favourable, and the dividend is at the rate of 4 per cent., free of incometax.
The Commissioners of Customs have authorized the formation of a mutual guarantee fund for such officers of that establishment as may be disposed to avail themselves of it, in lieu of providing by other means the personal security required from them. It
is to be constituted by a payment from each officer! of I per cent. on the amount of security taken. No fuxther payments will be caled for, except in case of necessity, to prevent the fund from falling below 3,5W0.
In Thle Times report to-day of the judgment on Saward and Anderson it is stated to have been for extensive forgeries on the City Bank. It should have been on the city bankers. The City Bank did. not suffer any loss by them.
The annexed information relative to the progress s
of Bnglish mining adventure is condensed from the 1 Mining Journal
"Up to last week the drop in the standard for copper ores was trifling, and not such as to call forth any anxiety on
the part of the miners, who may well be content if copper i keeps at its present remunerative price. Lead, as we stated last week, is stil advancing in price, and lead mines have a prospect of doing better than for some time past, while tin high as it is, seems likely still to advanco. The business transacted in the various shares has been moderate. The amount of dividends paid on 27 English mines during February was altogether 38,1161. At South Wheal Frances meeting the accounts showed a balance in favourofthecom. pany of 5,6211. ; a dividend of 101. per share was declared, and 6611. carried to the credit of the next account.

Tho sum of 5,2671. has been received on account of arrears of caUs. Ths balance in the hands of the directors was 9,8651.
and of the trastees under the lease 28,3101., aVIt Alo unissued debentum amounting to 27,0004 The roport of Mr. Brmnel, the enginor, stated that- aU the works between Truro and Liskeard were completed ready for the stations and the permanent way, exoept the erection of the timberwork of the Moorswater Viaduct. Between Liskeard and Saltash, and Plymouth and Saltash, the principal cuttings and embankments are nearly completed. The ironwork of the first span which would form tha western half of the bridge was all but completed, and would be floated in the summer.

LONDON, AMONVDAY, MARCH. 9, 5T7.
Tho premature Dissolution, if it may be so described, hastens an event which brings with it its own inconveniences and regrets. After a peaceful sway of eighteen years, the President of our Parliarmentary Republic will resign to a younger hand the task of bringing the new House into ivork;ng condition. We have all-that is, all who enter, either present or abaent, into the life of that little world -become so accustomed to Mr. SH,AW LSFEV3t, to his unfailing knowledge of a stil complex code, his prompt decision, his grave benignity, and the ewse with which he orders, if he wields not,
that fierce Democracy, that his retirement, come when it will, must take us by surprise. Were it not that we remember how everybody asked with one consent if it wsm posble the House of Commons could get on without MAhzxrs SuTroew, and that there were people who then went back to ABBoT, and even to ADDnaTOx, ever affirming that the oldest Speaker was always the best, we really should have our misgivings as to the capacity of any living man to fill so arduous a pest. We suppose a xpecial Providence must watch over Speakers and hedge round their chair, otherwise we could bardly account for the almost invariable success of the choice. The Sovereign has his brilliant Court, his tremendous Executive, his martialpomp, his palace, his retirement, his mystery, his laws, his prescriptions, terrors that are seen, and terrors still more formidable because they are not seen. The Speaker of the House of Commons, besides a chair, a robe, and a mace, to which CRorxri gave another name, has nothing whatever to trust to but the mind, voice, and manner of an English gentleman. Yet he reigns absolute. Ever present, always awake, never even alloweed to be unwell, and invariably in a good humour,-in fact, without even any of those smaller resources with which personages of the domestic drama eke out their natural gifts, the Speaker maintains his post against a crowd chosen rather for energy than for order, and better known for making their own way than always keeping the right road. It so happens, indeed, that SHAW LEFEVRX is a remarkable man. He is the very ideal of the Roman gentleman which CIcXRo loved to dwell upon, and which pamed to its last essence in his writings. He is an excellent lawyer, an agreeable speaker, a good magistrate, an agriculturist, and it is even said that, after all, he has mistaken his vocation, and ought to have been a general. Nobody, at least, can review yeomanry better. But, as everybody knows, all such official and professional qualities are but accidental functions, and the man is something more. By universal teStimOny Mrr. SHAW LEFEVRE might be regarded in fact, as in position, as the first Commoner of England,-au honour which many would hardly exchange for any more conventional and adventitious dignity.
And now comes the question, who is to succeed bim? The question is partly personal and partly political, for though a Speaker, by virtue of his cffice, has no politics, yet as an English gentleman he invariably has them. Personal qualities, however, even to such considerations as stature and looks, always affect the choice, and thus the election becomes an unexpected trial and a considerable hardship to the Government of the day, which finds itself immediately committed to a contest certainly not of its making, and almost wholly beyond its control. Such was the case when on PEEL meeting his new House in 1835 his own candidate, GourxunR, was beaten by ABERCROwNY, and the fate of the session was decided in the contest. There ought to be many aspirants for such an office, and there are several candidates. MEr. WALrOLR, MIr. FrrzToy, and MIr. STUAnT WoBTrx,y are in the field. No doubt, they are all of them good men. MIr. WALPOLE has at least all the suavity and goodnature that are indispensable in a Speaker, whatever other qualities are also required. The ex-Recorder and present Solicitor-General has also great claims on the public, and has committed himself rather deeply to the success of Lord PAT.MXRSTON'S Administration; but he has his resource, and perhaps his true vocation, on the bench, to which in due time he cannot fail to be promoted. Sir F. THESIGER, too, who was long since nameed for the Speakerahip, is young enough to look for a Chief Justiceship with a fair chance of success. There remains Mr. Frrzuoy, who perhaps belongs more to the same class of men as AWNS SuTTrON and LIrXvBX than the other candidates mentioned, and as such might be more able to assert and maintain that mysterious influence now prescriptive in the Speaker of the House of Commons. It would be premature to pronounce more decidedly on the comparative merits of these very unexceptionable men, as party is sure to add reasons of its own over and above personal considerations; and Lord PALrNSTOrN, who at this moment might have no other wish than to avoid an unnecessary contest, might find himself compelled by the very same feeling to throw all his weight into the scale of the least committed of the three candidates in the field.
Though the imperfect tribute we have paid. to the merits of the retiring Speaker has led us into a rather wide view of the qualifications of his high office, still, like every other position in life, it requires what is called in these days a certain speciality. That speciality is something more than legal. A Speaker must be able to cope with lawyers, otherwise he would fare ill in the Commons, but he must be something more than one of the fraternity. The usages of Parliament have contracted in the course of ages no small amount of that technicality which England appears to cherish above all other nations under the sun. It is no small part of the present Speaker's merits that on coming into office he applied himself to the task of simplifying, and, so to speak, straightening, the processes of legislation. By his unremitting exertions, continued to the present hour, he may be said to have reconstructed the entire system of Parliamentary procedure. Whether this reform has been carried to the utmost possible extent is a question on which unparliamentary observers can only speak with the utmost humility; but it is a notorious fact that few members, even thosewho have been successfully engaged in the introduction and carrying through of important measures, are thoroughly skilled in the stages and forms of legislation. There is a general belief that much remains to be done in the preparation of measures, in the subdivision of labour, and in defining the just province of Parliamentary action. Where the result is not satisfactory suspicion falls upon aU the proceses leading to it. We will not venture to say how far any lawyer, even one of the less reverential class of minds, would be the man to carry out Mr. SnAw LYFz1vx's work, but if it were put to the
nation at large they would probably expect more from a sensible country gentleman with active and businesslike habits, but without any of the bias incidental to a profe6sional character. The House of Commons, as might be expected from its very constitution, closely reflects all our popular movemaents and our soial changes, so that if there is any new evil, any enterprise, or any frenzy out of doors it is sure to be represented indoors. Parliament has sometimes gonewith the stream, sometimes resisted it; sometimes-worse than either-acted on the idea of extracting certain public good out of what was unquestionably foolish and wrong. If Premiers, if k aders, plead that they must temporize or fall, and that self-preservation points to the former alternative, and if what are caUed independent members possess little influence, may not the Speaker sometimes, in his mere private capacity, put some check upon legislative extravagances? The multiplied forms of Parliament are defended on the ground that they secure ample discussion and give every reasonable opponent or advocate the oppor!unity of a hearing. Yet the existing system of Parliamentary procedure as prescribed by Standing Orders has not prevented the greatest follies, all which plead the difficulties, the
temptations, the obstacles, and the expenss of the Parliamentary system. Can a Speaker do anything hera t Can he, too, do anythig to savo the precious hours of the aemsion froni mere wanton wasteot Can he to distribute his nods as to let the common sens of the country bo occasionally heard through the torrent of bombast with which we are liklely to be deluged ! We may, perhaps, overestimato the province and powers of a Speal;er, who is but the spirit of rulo and order, and can only keep in the proper place and time matters that come of themselves. But Speakers have sometimes had the credit of saving tne time, attention, and character of the House; snd we humbly submit that more remains to be done in this way.
We presume that by this time the Coalition
We presume that by this time the Coalition is beginning to have a foretasto of what awaits it in the forthcoming elections. Fivo days have barely passed since the vote of Wednesday morning became known, and already the answer of the country is one about which there can be no mistake. We were hardly prepared for results so immediate and conclusive. It would seem as if the national judgment and the national feeling have been quickened of late to keep pace with tho speed of material communication. Thero is no longer any necessity to appeal to the country in the sense of issuing explanatory addresses or making statements at public meetings. The late voto was a surprise, or the popular voice would have been sooner heard. Air. COBDEN'S resolutions were not considered of serious importance by the country in general, and it is barely a week sinco people were roused to the conviction that it was intended to turn & humanitarian motion into a regular party attack on the Government. First incredulity, then Surprise, then widespread indignation, have been the result. Men of every shade of politics have been equally scandalized by so audacious a combination. As to the great mercantile communities in London and the provinces, we believe there is but one opinion among them. Every man connected with our Eastern commerce, every man acquainted with the barbarous race with whom we are brought into contact, is convinced that the Government had no choice but to uphold its representatives in China. The public in general has taken the same view. Even those who are most opposed to war and conquest feel that here there was no alternative; and, what is more, they are conscious that this Chinese discussion has only been used as an opportunity for carrying into effect a concerted plan for the overthrow of the Government. The nation has therefore pronounced judgment at once. We learn that two of the chiefs who were ranged against the Government last week will have the discretion to seek other constituencies. MIr. ConDE.j Will not face the electors of the West Riding, but will, we are told, appeal to the comparatively insignificant constituency of Bolton. Lord JoH- RussxLL closes his connexion with the City of London, after having been one of its four representatives for nearly 16 years. We cannot but regret that tho course whichthisonce respected statesman has takenduring the last two years has beon such as justly to alienate from him the confidence of the first constituency in thekingdom. Lord JoN RusswLmight have played a dignified part in the late transactions, but his peevish impatience for office has led him into displays of factiousness towards a Government of his own political views which have seriously impaired his political reputation. Hle will, we believe, take refuge at Tavistock, a pocket borough of the house of BzDrosD. NTot a few of the more prominent of the Opposition members winl probably share the fate of Air. CODXNr and Lord Joui RUsssL. Indeed, we firnily believe that scarcely a Derbyite or Peelite will be elected by any of the large commercial constituencies of the country. The agricultural counties and the snaUer boroughs will, of course, return in many cases their former members; and thus, and thus only, will the Opposition be able to preserve a decent show of strength in the new House of Commons. Yet even in their chief strongholds they are likely to be attacked by Liberal candidates. The last General Election took place under the influence of Lord DERDY'S Government. The Whigs had shown signs of feebleness from their accession to power six years before, and after the death of Sir RosesT PEEL the declining influence of Lord Jornm RuSSE=L had become painfully apparent. There was, consequently, throughout the country something of a Conservative reaction, which might have lasted and strengthened had it not been for the gross incapacity of the new Cabinet, and the questionable proceedings of some of their subordinates. Amid this Last flickering of the Conservative flame the present Parliament was chosen, and not a few seats were thus gained to the party which follows Lord DERBY. But the situation is now changed. The failureof 1852,thesuddenabandonment of opinions held for years. and the air of charlatanism which attaches to one or two of the Conservative leaders, have alienated numbers of those who so voted five years ago, and very much cooled the remainder. All classes aud corporations, landlords, farmers, the Church, the Universities, confess now to being somewhat Liberal. We may predict, that among the constituencies now represented by so-caUled Conservatives there are thousands of voters who would be ready to accept a Ministerial candidate, and that those who remain faithful to the Opposition cause will give their votes with littlo enthusiasm and feel hardly any concern at an adverse result.
There is, we believe, a deep feeling that the political confusion of the last few years ought to be brought to an end by the establishment of a strong national Government. The House of Commons cannot always remain a chaos of discordant and obstructive factions. The old cliques and their watchwords are thoroughly worn out. The Legiaslature had a busy and veryuseful session before it, but just as we had finished a great war, and were turning our attention again to pea
ful, practical reforms, we have the whole process interrupted and the session lost, because three or four sets of discredited politicians choose to begin declaiming in conventional rhetoric about inhumanity and aggression, well knowing that they themselves, had they been in office, would have done exactly what they revile the Mlinister for doing. Of this kind of thing every one feels that we have had enough. If the country is to have any position abroadif Parliament is to pass any serviceable measures at home, it is necessary to support a Government against this eternal obstructiveness. The country is accordingly speaking out with all the warmth of indignation. Lord PAUXRsTro.? has been asked to stand for London and for 3Ianchester, nud we verily believe he would be returned by half the constituencies in the kingdom. There can be no doubt that the supporters of the Government will be in a large majority in the new House. The ocmstituencies only want suitable men to offer themselves, and they will do their duty.
It is not without much satisfaction that wo have observed the sound judgment and accurate moral
sense of the public. Let no set of professional politicians henceforth pretend to lead the country. Political knowledge is generaaUy at too high a level for any man to overtop very far the understandinig of his countrymen. In this matter no one can fail to see that the country has taken a browler View than the political sections of thti louse thouight possible. While the
variouschiefsof the newleaguowere congratuting themsclves on their management of the details of the CantOn dispute the nation wasalready looking at the 3finisterial question an a whole, and had resolved not to confine the discusion to s singlo issue. Th-e results of this better judgment will bo found in the increawd security of our poition both at horne and abroad. Thoso who wish to mneasure the national losswhich would have followed tlho fall of Lord PALxsxvsToW on auch a question should observo the spirit in which the news of his defeat has been receivod on somo parts of the Con. tinent. It is keenly felt in more than ono foreign Court that the present Government ha5 upheld the honour of this country, and oonsequently tho satisfaction at the supposed advent of a victorioug Coalition has not been concealed. However, such hopes are destined to wither speedily. The people feel too well that the state of things which grewout of the Russian war has not yet passed away, that the earth still trembles with tho after-ahoclA of that great convulsion, and that a clear he.j and a strong hand are still neoessary to guide the destinies of England.
Along with the Estimates for the several services
Along -with the Estimates for the several rervices of the State have now been published the Estimates of those particular departments which provide the ways and means for aU the others-riz., the departments charged with the collection and realization of the national Revenue. The dociunent containing this useful information extendfto the length of nearly 100 pages, and exhibits rat'ber a formidable array of statistics; but in a few words we may say that the entire publie incomo of Great Britain, with exceptions of comparatively little consequence, is levied under two main heads-one comprising the duties exacted at the water's edge on commodities introduced into this country from abroad, and the other the receipts derived from internal taxation. In these two great divisions are ranged all those multitudinous imposts which are felt under the general operation of taxes.
Of the Customs we gave our readers some description the other day, and need only observe at present that the sum total of the produce received under this head may be set, in round numbers, at some 23,000,0001. At what cost, then, is this money collectedI To that inquiry a clear answer is given in the pages before us, where we find that the salaries and expenses required for getting in the Customs are estimated for tho ensuing year to amount to 855,4821.-in other vwords, we collect 23 millions for something more than four-fifths of a million, though there is a large addition to be made to this reckoning, as will appear below. The distribution of these expenses will be readily understood from the nature of the service. There is, first, an establishment charged w.ith the duty of general superintendence, and represented by the Custom-house in Thames-street, after which one great item in the account is formed by the port of London, another by the port of Liverpool, and a third by all the other ports and creeks in the United Kingdom taken together. The expenses of the superintending establishment are 84,5671., and those of the Port of London, 302,3631. It shows the enormous amount of commerce conducted on the Thames when we find that this latter outlay is very little exceeded by that required at all the other ports together-viz., 328,4231., while Liverpool, important as it is, stands for only 121,1391. The number of persons employed at the metropolitan port is 1,879 ; at Liverpool, 935; over the rest of the country, 2,611. A certain allowance for law charges and expenses will, when added to the items above given, make up this cost of collecting the Customs to the specified suni.
The Inland Revenue is more comprehensive, but still very intelligible. It may be divided into the three great heada of Excise, Stamps, and Taxes-the first producing about 17,000,0001., the second about 7,000,0001., and the third (exclusive of the Income-tax) about 3,000,0001. These sums together form a total of about 27,000,0001., or, if the probable odd figures are included, of 28,000,0001., and the aggregate cost of collection, exclusive of 63,1201. for the Revenue Polico of Ireland, is estimated at 1,429,1331. This appears a larger expenditure than that incurred in the Customs' Department, but an addition, as we have remarked, remains to be made in that respect, and the proportion itself will be considerably diminished when the amount of the Income-tax is added. Thus, for the year last past the entire amount of the Inland Revenue was some 44,000,0001., and for the ensuing year, setting the Income-tax at 7,000,0001., it will be 35,000,0001.-a sum comprehending the receipts from a great variety of imposts,-from the several Excise duties, from Stamps, Licenses, and Certificates of all sorts and kinds, and from the Land-tax, House-tax, and Assessed Taxes. The principal items in the costs incurred are formed by the expenses of the chief office, of the establishments, with their officers, in England, Scotland, and Ireland respectively, and by the poundage allowed to distributors of stamps, and to clerks, collectors, and assessors of taxes. The chief office is expected to cost 205,0001.; the English establishlment, 294,0921.; the Scotcb, 115,1751.; the Irish, 96,9661. In the shape of poundage the distributors of stamps receive an estimated allowance of 48,0001.; the clerks to local Commissioners, 135,0001. ; and collectors and assessors, 220,0001, Postage and carriage of parcels are set at 30,0001.; buildings and repairs of buildings at 25,0001.; and misceUaneous expenses (including 95,0001. for travelling allowances and charges) at 181,9001.
It appears, then, from a review of the foregoing Estimates that in the ensuing year we shall be collecting under these two great heads of Customs and Inland Revenue atotal amountof some 58,000,00O0. income at a total cost of some 2,350,0001. This conclusion, however, exhibits a very considerable discrepancy both from the aggregate figures of the Estimates before us-where the total demand for the Revenue Departments is 4,699,0661. -and from the observations made in one of the recent debates by the CUi.rczLLoR of the ExcHEQuEi, who, in accordance with the latter statement, spolke of the collection of the Revenue as likely to cost nearly 5,000,0001. The nature of this difference and the principle on which we have regulated our own description can be very soon explained. The Revenue Eatimates comprise not only the three votes we have mentioned, for the Customs, Inland Revenue, and Irish Reventue Police, but also a fourth of undoubted importance-viz., that for the Post-office. But, although the Post-office is certainly a source of revenue, and although its accoints are thus very properly brought into the Revenue Estimates, it will be evidet)t upon reflection that the charges of this department cannot be balanced against its receipts upon the same principles of reckoning as would apply to the Inland Revenue or the Customs. In these latter departments the object is simply taxation, and in looking into their accounts we merely inquire at what expense the taxes are realized. The Post-office, however, is a very different affair. Here the first object of the department is the disecharge of an important public service, and it is only the surplus of the money paid by the public in return for this service which finds its way into the Exchequer as a branch of the Revenue. The consequence, as a matter of courac, is, that in thjs department the charges bear a far greater pro-
portion to the receipts than in the others; in fact, whereas the receipts are some S,800,0001. or 3,000,0001., the charges are no less than 1,868,1811. Neither is any increase in these expenses a point about which we need -complain, since it would imply probably that the *public were getting greater accommodation for ,their money. It follows, however, that if, on oaccount of the Post-office, we add to the figures given above nearly 2,000,0001. on the score of -costs, and barely 3,000,0001. on the score of teturns, we should be representing the actual coets *of the collection of the Revenue at too high a figure-the general percentage being unduly in-creased by the very large percentage of this anomalous item.
We prefer therefore, in looking at this branch of the public expenditure, to met aside the Post-office :Department, as not admitting of due comparison; but, on the other hand, there is an item which, though separated from the Revenue Estimates for -urposes of convenience, ought in justice to be brought into the account. We speak of the Coastguard, the charge for which has been removed to the Navy Estimates, but which zfigured last year for 486,0281. There is -another charge, too, for the non-effective .arvices of these three departments which must be included, and which, if we deduct 35,0001. -aigned as the share of the Post-office, appears estimated at 448,1501. These figures, then, will .enable us to arrive at a general conclusion. Excluding - Post-office and taking no ac-count of the CBowN Lands and MiscelJaneous IReceipts, we obtain an income of 58,000,0001., .or thereabouts, raised from Customs and Inland Revenue, at an aggregate charge for collection of 3,281,9]31. ; and, distributing this once more, we find that the Customs, producing their 23,000,0001., cost (including the Coastguard) 1,576,1951., and that the Inland Revenue, yieldingits 35,000,0001., demands 1,705,7181.

The Senate passed the Bil to amend the tariff of 1840 on the 24th. The Senate's Committee on Finance agreed to report amendments on the Tariff Bill. Mr. Hunter, chairman of the committee, had prepared a Bill on his own responsibility, and would endeavour to procure the consideration of the subject on the 25th. An article in the Washington Union on the Central American treaty, denouncing in very violent language all interference by Great Britain in America, had occasioned a very uneasy feeling. The New York Courier anLd Enqjirer replies to the article in indignant terms, and says:-
" The artiole from the Union has excited much attention in political circles, as being perhaps an index of the policy of the incoming Administration towards England. If it really is such, there is indeed reason for a sensation. Its
pirit is hostile, its charges untrue, its demands unjust, and its sentiments insulting and unwarrantable."
The House of Representatives had passed the Senates joint resolutions for ascertaining and fixing the relative value of the coins of Great Britain in the United States. The House had passed a Bill for a modification of the tariff. It provides simply for an addition to the free list on and after the 1st of next July, without proposing any other changes. It is substantially the same as reported at the close of the last session of Congress. One of the provisions is that only wool of the value at the port of importation of 15c. per lb. or less, or S0c. per lb. or over, shall be free; lead, hemp, iron, and sugar remain as at present.

WASHImGTOl[, FEB. 21
It is generally understood, though it cannot yet be officially announced, that 3r. Buchanan has comploted his Cabinet appointments. It has been a work (if no sinall difficulty from the prsaure of severml -ections of the party that has borne the new Presidentt iati oflice to secure the nomination of their caididates or favourites. These efforts have disturbed the earliest calculations of the principal result, but nt altered it. The firstrumours, which, eeveral wt eks ago, allotted the office of Secretary of State to l; eneral and Senator Cass, have proved more correct than the many subsequent reports. General Casm is appointed as the successor of Mr. Marcy. The office is equivalent to that of Premier, being the most importait in the Cabinet. How much of its duties, Sr what part of them, the President will himself unidertake time will show, but it is not likely that a man so long inured to office, political and diplomatic, as Mr. Buchanan wiU be merely the nominal head of the Government, and of the whole Government the foreign depaitmient is the most important. As to the internal affairs of the Republic, the several States govern themselves ; and the revenue requires only watching, not nursing. If simply let alone, it is sure to increase. The foreign policy of the American Government will therefore, in aU probability, be under the joint direction of bIr. Buchanan and General Cass.
There were three candidates for the seat of Mr. Marcy-Mr. CObb, of Georgia, the nominee of the moderate and conservative Southern section of the Senate; Mr. Walker, 'who was Secretary of the Treasury during the Presidency of Mr. Polk . and General Cass. Mr. Walker was supported by the aggressive democracy North and South, the patrons of Filibusterism and cbampions of " anifest destiny," and unlimited slavery everywhere; to carry out tbeir principles fully they would requira a planet to themselves ; but as long as they are surrounded by other parties and communities they ara Hable to meet with checks, as inthe present instance. Notwithstanding the strong pressure they brought to bear on the new President in favour of Mr. Walker, they have failed, partly from the fact that there is a North, with a mass of opinion (or prejudice) against slavery as the basis of society, which the ultras of the South have lately not only defied, but insulted,-and partly from some undefined, but very general, want of confidence in their candidate. Mr. Walker is said to be an able man, but since his official career he has become an extensive speculator, and the public estimate of his fitness for a higher political office than he held before has not increased. Between the Conservatism of 3Mr. Cobb and the aggressive tendencies represented, or supposed to be represented, by Mr. Walker, General Cass furnishes the compromise. He is one of the ancient names of the Democratic party, and the moderate Southern section can accept him. He has not run wild on slavery, like many of the younger race, who are perfect fanatics on the question; and very lately he has denounced in the Senate some of the enormities they perpetrated in Kansas, particularly the Algerine code of laws they forced on the freesettlers. Mr. Buchanan's first preference for his old compeer probablysprung from his foresight of the difficulties into which an entangling alliance with the fiery Tybalts of th3 extreme democracy would involve him, and though the strong influence they put in action made him waver, or seem to waver, in his choice, he has stuck to his first decision. As to the feeling of European States to wards the new American Cabinet, Mr. Buchanan himself is so compromised with them by the threats of the Ostend manifesto, that he couild scarcely make any appointment that could increase their uneasy misgivings for the future under his r6gime, General Cass, it is well known, is afflicted with a chronic aversion to England, but the feeling begins rather to excite ridicule than alarm; and he has another special and personal antipathy to Lord Clarendon, which will not tend to smoothen the little asperitiea of official intercourse. What particular act or speech of our Foreign Secretary has excited this animosity must be sought somewhere in the past; but if the reports of Washington circles can be credited it is very strong. With a suspended treaty, taken from the hands of the Administration that concluded it, to be dealt with by the new one, the prospect of affairs in not satisfactory.
Great preparations are being made for celebratin the inauguration, and an enormous influx of depu. tations of different kinds, civil and military, is ex. pected. Tt wil be lucky if Washington escapes something approaching a famine for a few days, so large are the numbers announced as the expected addition of the population.
The report of the committee of inquiry into alleged corrupt practices by members of Congress will be again considered on the 20th; a stormy debate is expected. The report recommends the expulsion of four members; but the evidence as published does not convict them of having actuaUy received bribes, only that they exhibited a readiness under certain circumstances of being influenced by suchconsiderations. The general report intimatet that "the lobby" has created and encouraged a belief that it has an influence it does not really possess, and in this way has obtained money from parties interested in claims and bils as the price of its assistance, while the sums so obtained were actually thrown away. It thinks an exposure of the imposition wil be sfficient to cure the eviL There may be some truth in this, as many measures for which it was under&tood large amounts of money were ready to be expended have completely failed. But public opinion goes much further. It believes the committee has been baffled in the inquiry, and that the failure in detecting any distinct case of bribery is no proof it does not exist.
The Tennessee arrived at New York from Aspinwall on the 21st; the inteUigence from Nicaragua is not important; Colonel Titus, who figured as a Border-Ruffian leader in the troubles in Kansas, had arrived with a party of recruits, and, joining with Colonel Lockridge, the officer commanding at Panta Arenas, had ascended the San Juan to attempt to recover the posts on the river in the hands of the Costa Ricans. There had been some indecisive fighting at Rivas and San Jorge; it was reported that in an attack on the latter place Heninmigsen had been repulsed with the loss of several of his officers; none of the details were known.
The grand jury of Newv York have indicted mrs. Cunningham and Mr. Eckel for the murder of Dr. BurdeUl on the 3Ist of; Jauar.

YoRsRSRMx-The constituents of the various Parliamentary boronghs in the West Riding of Yorksbire have already begun to look out for the right men to send as their representatives in Parliament, and anmong a large portion of the inhabitants there is a strong determination to return such as will sunpport the policy of Lord Palmerston's Government with reference to the Chinese question, First of al, as to the representation of the West Ridingitself, there is not a sbadow of a chance of 'ar. Cobden being again elected, the hon. gentlemxn's opinions on the war with Russia having decided his fate some time ago. Indeed, it is extremely doubtful whether Mr. Cobden will ventu;re to come before the electors even to thank them for their past confidence So far, therefore, as the West Riding is concerned, the mover of the resolution which ha had the effect of bringing about a dissolution -will most undoubtedly not find his way back again to St Stephen's, Mr. B. Denison, the other member, wil nost likely be agin elected. The probable successor of Mr. Cobden is not yet known. Various gentlemen have been mentioned, including Sir John Ramsden, Lord Goderich, and the Right Hon. T. R-ines, but no definite nomination has beenmade. It is said that'Sir John Ramnsden, who will be supported by the Fitzwsilliam interest, is likely to be preferred. At Leeds, the capital of the Riding, there is every probability of the re-election of the Right Hon. hi. T. Baices, anda meeting is to be held on the 16th inst. for the purpose of taking steps to present a reounisition to Mr. Baines and to r. William Beckett, one ofthe present members for Ripon, who, althongh a Coneervative, voted with the Government against Mr. Cobde's resolution. Mr. Robert Hall, barrister, is also spoken of aR a Conservative candidate; and the name of Mr- S. Morley, of the Administrative ReformAssociation, has also been mentioned as a candidate on the Liboral interest. Sir George Goodman, ir consequence of ill-hea1th, will not come forwvard again. At Bradford Mr. Robert Milligan will resign his seat, but Mtr. H. W. Wickham will again come forward. Several names have been mentioned as those of probable candidates to succeed Mrr. Mbilligan, among whom may be mentioned Major-Gerral Thompson, Mr. E. Ackroyd. of Denton and Halifax; Mtr. Titus Salt, of Crow-nest; Mr. William Mnurgatroyd, of BRimcfield; and Mr. H. W. Ripley, of Sightcliffe. At HAlifar, the present members, the Right Hon. Sir Charles Wood and Mr. Frank Crossley will again be nominated. TheConservatives are gettingup aenquisitionto Major Edwrds, At EIudderafleld its anticipated that Lord Goderch will again be returned, he having on several occasions refused to allow himself to be nominated for any other borough as long as his present constituents were satisfied with his conduct. At Wakefield iMr. George Sandars, the Conservativ member, wll retire, and Mr. J. C. D. Charlesworth or Mfr. Leatbam will probably be brought forward in his stead. The Liberals have not yet fixed upon a candidate. At Pontefract no opposition will be offered to Mr. Monclcton Milnes, but Mr. Ohveira wil be opposed by Mr. Wood, to whom a very numerously signed requisition ws presented a short time ago. There wil be four candidates at Knaresborough. Mr. Dent, one of the present members, and Mr. Westhead, who formerly sat for the borough, will be brought forward by the Liberals, and Mr. Woodd, the present Conservative member, and Mr. CoDins. barrister, who has aso repiesented the bor9tgh, will be nominated by the Conserratives. The Liberal electors of Hull held a meeting at the Cross Keys Hotel on Saturday afternoon for the purpose of selecting two candidates for the representation of the borough in Parliament. There was a large attendance. Mr. James Clay, bI.P. for Hull, was unanimously selected s one of the candidates. The Hon. W. H. F. Donison son of Lord Londesborough, was proposed as the second candidate, aud a letter was read from that gentleman annonncing that be was a tborough Reformer. He was unanimously selected as tbe colleague of L-. Clay. During the meetiDg a letter was'read from Mr. W. D. Seynour, one of the present borough members, declining to stand again for Hull. The meeting was strongly in favour of lord Palmerston, and it was underatood that the two gentlemen selected wero prepared to support his Lordship. Mr. Schneider and Mr. H all, of London, and Mr. Aldarn, late M.P for Leeds, and Chairman of the Aire and Calder Company, are also mentioned ag probable candidates.

Wos.cxsTxss-There is likely to be a contest for the representation of this city. Tbe conduct of the Liberal member, Mr. Laslett, in voting against Lord Palmerston on Mr. Cobden's motion, has met the decided disapproval of a certain portion of his supporters, who are about to exhibit it in an lnmistkeable manner. The Derbyites intend, it is said, to bring forward Alderman Sidney, of London, and 31r. Huddleston, of the Oxford Circuit intimated at the last election his intention of coming forward again in the Conmervative interest whenever an opportunity offered. The Council of the Parliamentary Reform Asociation bern have issed a long address to the electors of the city caling, upon them to support Mr. Ricardo and Mr. Lmlett s being two consistent Reformers, The address i dted March 9, but wac circulated on Saturday night.

GztxZT YARmOu7TH.-HEe there is every probability of a severe contest. The Conservative candidAtes are expected to be Sir E. Lacon, one of the present members, and the Hon. C. S. Vereker, who received pledges of support from the party some time since. The Liberal candidates are Mr, Tcrrens M'Cullagh, and Mr. E. W.

CIATHaNI.-Mr. W. G. Romaine, C.B., Doputy-Tudee AdvorAte with the artny lately serving in the East, anl a Liberal in politics, has announced his intention of becoming a candidate for the representation of the boroogh. In his address, just issued, he says -

PLYmtou l-" Plymouth, we are glad to see," says the Westcrn Times, " wll get rid of Mr Roundell Palmer, and return two Liberals. North Devon bas two members who are getting past senatorial labour. Mr. Buck, it is said, can never go up to Parliament again - and Sir Thomas Acland, who is 70 years old, experiences the infirmities incidental to that advanced period of life. The Tories talk, we hear, of brihging Sir Stafford Northcote forward for North Devon, in the room of Ir. Buck, as a alight compliment to ir. Gladstone, in return for the services rendered by that able casuist, and in token of their peace With the Peelite. In South Devon Sir John Buller and Mr. Palk will, of course, be returned without op position. Dartmouth may, perhaps, wrestle against Sir HIenry Seale's ascendancy, out in no other part of the county do we see any likelihood of a change.,
CoRs.lvALU-1n East Cornwall there will be a contest - Mr. Robarts and lr. Kendall, the present members, and

The Lord-Advocato enteredmito a general defence of the polcy of Lord Palmerston, and expreised his belief that the country was of opinion not ony that the vote of the House of Commons in regard to China was not well roundod in itself, but that the circumstances under which that vote was given and the parties from whom it proceeded, so far from weakening the hold which Lord Palmerston's Government had on the people, ought more properly to strengthen it. His Lordship aUndod to theo course adopted towards Persia as another proof of the firmness and vigour of Lord Palme'ston, and proceeded to allude to various matters of domestic legislation, and to the great industrial and commercial prosperity that existed. A resolution of confidence in Lord Palmerston's Govrnmtent was adopted.

I SURREY MI!A MI.
The new piece aFr'eud and its ViFdTms prodnood at thU Iotuse is an excellent specimen of the melodramatic genua, combining the greatestyaritty of situation and Incident with that reference to modern life and interests that is espcially conducive to a wide popularity. Three distinct contingencies hare coineided to gire the pleot as executed, a value byound the comron average. In the first plae, & drama to thb.rPughly adaptable to Erglish smpathies a Lei Pautnr s de Paris is iok often to be found! on the P.rn,ian stage. In the scond plce, Mr. Stirling Co.ne, in changing the scene of action laid d,,wn lhy M. Brisebarro ad No., bxas show far more skill than the generality of adapters, hsaing turnea the Pariia. pers nages of the original into real types. of London life. In the third place very effective acting is re quired in at least three parts, and this is to be found at tho Surrey Tbetre. Every conditionprecedent is fulfilled, ant a rare success is the natural consequence
The piece (as modified by Mr. Coyno) opens at a banling& housc in Liverpool in the year 18i5. Mr. Hugglestone, the banker, having oonverted all his seuritims into cash, Is on the point of "bolting," as he tlinks, without the know;ledge of any one. He has reckoned without his host His clerk, Tom Trumper, hu discovered his plan and will not hold his tonigue without a valuable consideration. Just while master and clerk are arranging this little affa[re Edward Seahorne, a c ptain in the merchant service, whohas saved a sum of 10,000L as a provision for his wife and family, comes to place the whole of that anount in Hugglestone's hands, and, having made the deposit, departs with t',e necessary receipt. Hugglestone rejoices to find his tr.nsure thus unexpectedly increased, but the more tender.heArted clerk flinches from the thought of consigning a whole fanily to misery. In a few minates the Captain returns. He has beard reports not favounrable to the character of the house, and wants his money back. Hugglestone prevaricate, and poor Snaborne, who has been warned by hi. medical man to abstain from vi'olert excitemont, is wrmight up to such a frenzy of rage that he falla dead on the floor. The villanous banker rejoioes that the 10.0001 are now without a visible claimant, but Tomt Trumper takes the receipt from the pocket of the deceased, as an instruo,cnt that may be useful on occasion.
Twelve years slip away, and we are now in 1857. The, Captain's family, consisting of a wife, a son, and a daughter, are living in a state of apparent comfort, but, in point of fact, the unhappy lady is deeply in debt, and conceals her real circumstances not to wound the feelings of her children. Huqglestone the fraudulent, after along absenco in Australia, has returned ass a miUionnaire, with the assumed name of Warrington. and Tom Trumper, who has expended the price of his taciturnity, is now an itinerant vendor or six-bladed knives. At this stage of the story the piece rises from "drame" to conedy, and the straits of that peculiar class of the poor which is forced to keep ups, decent appearance in spite of scanty means are delineated with a great deal of force. The famnily of the late Captain are, of course, tbe chief representatives of " genteel misery," hot a young French Count, who has inherited a, heaviv mortagedestate in Bretagne, but who bas not a shilhng in his pocket, is brought into the picture by thf
circumstance that he is the accepted suitor of Mliss Sea-
By one of those chxances without which theatrical lifer woild be impossible Hugglestone comes into contact wOith the family of bis deceased victim He is Mrs. Seaborne's landlord, and a very hard landlord too, who rega2ds with infinite disgust all delays in the payment of rent. Moreover, his daughtcr, the haughty Ismbella, employs Mims Sea. borne as a dressmaker, and, what is moro important, determines to marry the young Fronch Count, whose poverty is in her favour, as it makes him a purchaseable commodity. The Count, it is true, loves Miss Seaborne, but the unhappy rempstress is forced by her tyrannical employer to refuse the offer of his hand, being informed that this is the only way to sve him from ruin. Neverthelees, the Nemesis is getting ready in the distance. Tom Trumper has recognize& Hugglestone in the pretended Warrington and, though for an attempt to make his knowledge profitable he is committed to prison as a va&pbond who tries to raise money by false pretences, the audionco feel perfectly convinced that th& avenging thunderbolt which is to hurl the guilty hanker from his pinnacle is in honest Tom's possession and will be launched some time or other.
The tone of the piece again changes from comedy to. 'drame." The Seaborne family have gunk from genteel poverty into that wretched stato in which evea a meal is unattainable. In bringing his pathos to the highest point the author has almost grazed against the ludicrous. The daughter, who takes in neodlework, cannot receive her w;ages for three days, the mother goes to pawn her vedding-ring, hut finds die shop shut up for the night; anti when, under these distressing circumstances, they meet at the foot of Waterloo-bridge, and, plucking up courage~ petition alms of a strangers they discover that the perown ad-
CetdiS th other mem6er of the family, wvho is of coursel as penniless asthemseIves, and is Tainly endeavouring t
earn a trife by carrying trunls from the Snuth-Westerr: Railvay station The poor fellow at last strikes up a song in the street that chbritable patrons of rt may reward hint with their halfpence, but falls exhausted on the pavement.
The climax of misery is, however, exhibited In a double scene, representing two rooms in a wretched garret-one occupied by the Seabornes, the other by Tom Tramper, whose term of imprisonment has expired. Honest Tom ex. pects s visit fron his old master Hugglestone, who is coming to treat for the purchase of that receipt which represents his liability to the Soabornes, and with which
om has never prted. The recpectable visitor arrives, and, finding Tom's dsemands exorbitant, infuses an opiato into, the spirituous liquor wherewith tho fallen clerk comforts his inner man. This done he retires, telling Tonm he shall bear from him on some future occasion, but secretly resolving to come back and Inexpensively detach the document from the sleeping possessor. At this point the aspect ef thei stage becomes ghastly indeed. Mrs. Seaborne bas lighted a charcoal fire with the intention of ending her miserable existence and the danghter bha resolved to share the benefit of the mid but mortiferous fumes. Thus on t5e left the audience behold two ladiet gasping away their lives, while on the right poor Tom is struggling agdinst the less deadly hut more unpleasmnt effects of the drug. This is a good strong dose of physical horror, and might perhaps prove al*nosttoo strong were it not immediately foUowed by a bappy turn in the general position of affairs. Young Sea. borne, who having picked up a 1001-note, has restored it to. If s lat ful owner, though sorely tempted by the psngs of hunger, bmh thus gained a friend, who promises him a lucrative place and comes home just in time to save his mother and sister from the final effects of the carbonic fumes. In the meanwhile Hugglestone, wbo has returned to Tom's garrt, in vxin tries to discover the receipt about the person of the sleeper, for the wily knave, guessing the stratagem contrived a&tainsft him, put the document under A. trapdoor before sensibility was quite extinct. Now Is the thundercloud fully charged, for a desire of vengeanoe will naturally cause Tom to let his knowledge have its ful effect. Just as Hugglestone, his daughter and her hridfgroom, the Count, are proceading to St. Martin's Church, where the nuptial ceremony is to take plaoc, while the bereaved Miss 8exborne stands among the Fpectators in TraNflar-square and views tae ceremony rith tearful eyes, Tom, now broadly aLwake, rushes In, flourisbing the receipt, which he places in the hands of young Seaborne, and summons a couple of policemen, rho at once arrest the respectable " Warrington" for the crimes of the fiandulent Hugglestone.
That this is a good stirring talo admirably fitted for melodramatic purposes will be clearly seen by every one who understxnds the wants of a Surrey public But, as we hare smid, the merits of the pieoe are beyond the common averge of the clas to rhich it belongs. The Incidents, though numercus, are connected in a manner perfectly intelligible, antd there is none of that haziness that so often envelopes the nrost showy of transpontine dramas. The acting is iJst ,shat is required to complete the effect of the outline. Mr. Cyamwick, who plays the two Seabornes, fatber and son,, it in both capcities the very man to onlist the popular sympathies, as the representative of frankness and good principle in a general atmosphere of villainy. His deathFtrupglex, as the senior, when he sinks under an affection of tRe brain, sre imposing; his distres, as the junior, rhen he basglideddornintomendicity,is uathetic withoutaffectxtion,. Tom Trumper, the pet rascal of the piece, who badgers the Is ore cleanlyvillain, and finaJy enlistson the ide of virtue, is nsado up to perrection by Mr. Shepherd.-the dirty face,the, brown-paper cap, the dull curly hair, and the generally drgged attitude which distinguish him when, his clerkship over, he is first discovered at the entrance to the Burliiiton-arcado, constituting the complete type of a. welluknowu class of the London vagrant. Then ther comfortable sense of cunning which is nsuained through all hix vicissitudes is indicated with most humorots complacency. Though fortune has knocked himn about the man knows that he Is master of the position snd he resolves to enjoy himselfwhatever obstacles may TZ redo his path to ultimato victory, cortain that they wil b-e all overcome in the end, Mr. Basil Potters Hlugglestene is really an exoellent piece of high comedy acting,quiet and completely natural. Tle speces of noral depravity he reprents is by nO means eommnon upon the stage. e is rdither impudent, Satanic, cynical, iicy, mysterious, or even hypocritical, but sinsply landi anel businesslike, and JOU feel that if he seumitted a forgersit would certainly be with a well-madepea. Per Mr.H. Widdicombe, wrhose absence from the moot thrilling ofj mnelodramas would at oneo be felt and lamented by tha.
ur enthusiasts, there is a fittig part hin tlhe per20i of aX benevolent house.palinter, whbo, tapport tbe digty of thei Seabornes, generously dons a Iivsy e n tle eacase of a. party, and invariably laughs in a goo caue. re, then, is a varied banquet, and heartil is I .anyd by tb~ audience.

PARIS, FRIDAY, MARXC 6, 6 pm.
The Paris journals continue to direct their excluaive attention to the check to the Palmerston Admimistration; their remarks, however, being chiefly of a speculative character have lost their main interest, mince the doubts entertained by them with respect to a dissolution of Parliament have been satisfactorily cleared up by the communication made to the House of Commons by Lord Palmerston,
The Silcle thus expresses itself
What profit can the Chinese Coalition derive from the 'lcory It has obtained? None, in our opinion; for the Valous elements which compose it would find it difficult to form a durable Government. Lord Palrnerston is about to appea to the country, and The Times prodicts for him a triumph. We entertain similar ideas, but we do not concel our opinion that the majority of the electors wldl be tmdec1ded in the choice of their representatives. The dislocation of old parties has been effected without a new party, imposing in its number, and calculated to
inspire confidence in the nation, having been organized. The disolution of Parliarment has become a necessity through the dissolution of parties in that Parliament; but this same disorganization manifests Itself in the electoral body; it is nevertheless probable that it will rally round Lord Palmerston."
The D8bats, which has never more than one ideaanti-Paluerston-believes that the vote recorded by the majority of the House of Commons is destined to modify the diplomatic relations of the great Powers, as likewise to produce universal satisfaction on the continent. The "satisfaction" will be shortlived.
In the preliminary Conference yesterday on the NeuchMel question, and at which neither the Prussian nor the Swiss Plenipotentiary was present, the renunciation of the Royal authority in that canton was proposed as the basis of future negotiations.
A private letter from Friburg, dated the 3d, speaks of the apprehensions entertained of a radical movement in that place, and letters from the environs appear to confirm the existence of these fears. There is no doubt that a good deal of discontent, rapidly growing into resentment, has been caused by the delay in the settlement of the Neuchatel question, and by the suspicions of unfair dealing on the part of the King of Prussia.
The Council of State assembled to-day at the Palace of the Tuileries to discuss the question of imposing a tax on personal property. The Emperor presided.
The Presse publishes a letter from Rome of the Ist inst., which states that the Austrian military authorities had made numerous arrests simultaneously at Bologna, Rimini, and Cesena. MM. Sallucci and Zaniboni had been arrested at Bologna, to the great surprise of the inhabitants, as they enjoyed a high reputation for probity and capacity. They were immediately handed over to be tried by the Austrian Court-martial which is always sitting. The peraons arrested were al in the employment of the Coverment.
A letter from Odessa of the 23d February informs us that the announced Russian Steam l.avigation Company had as yet given no sign of life. Their agent, Captain Arkas, had endeavoured to purchase some steamers in Fiance, but could find none fit for his purpose. He subsequently went to England, where he purchased eight steamboats, which are daily expected at Odessa. Trade is so dull in that town that several merchant captains had discharged their crews and laid up their ships, seeing no chance of procuring a freight. The port had been frozen for 10 days, and was not clear of ice until the 18th February. The English steamfrigate which brought the EnDglish Commiissioners for settling the bou.ndaries had sailed. The Danube being frozen, the Commissioners could not proceed fromVarna to Galatz, and were forced to go round by Odessa.
A letter from Rome of the 23d ult. states that the carnival was proceeding with extraordinary gaiety, to the great satisfaction of the small tradespeople, who were making much money by the strangers. The corn monopoly continued in the Roman States without any attempt to conceal it, and the consequence is an increasing dearness of provisions. The Pope, in order to put an end to the ecarcity, had commissioned a merchant named Amici to go into the Marches and purchase 50,000 hectolitres of grain, in order to sell them again at Rome, even at a loss. Having arrived at Ancona he found the price of grain excessively high in consequence of the efforts of the fores aera. 1. Amici having stated the object of his visit, prices rose higher, and he was forced to purchase at an exorbitant rate. The consequence will be, that the Government will sell the grain at Rome at a great loss. The monopolists wyill purchase it and sell it again at an enormous profit. Thus the Government, while meaning well, will do further injury. Monsignor Mateucci, the chief of the police had great difficulty in obtaining permission for the Romans to wear masks during the carnival. Cardinal Antonelli was strongly opposed to it. The permission to wear masks becomes every year an affair of State in the councils of the Holy Father!
Some time since the Paris papers were "invited" (that is, ordered) not to publish notices or advertiEements about the Russian rail-oads. It appears that yesterday the managers of papers were informed that the prohibition was removed.
The following private telegraphic despatch has been received:-

AUSTRIA.
(ERO31 OR OIVXo COORa POxNDN.)
VIENNA, WAR= 4.
Count Cavour's reply to Count Buol's note of February 10 is considered unsatisfactory, and so much excitement prevails in official circles that the diplomatic world is inclined to believe the Austrian Legation will sOOn be recalled from Turin. It is said that the French and British Cabinets have st ongly advised the Austrian Government not to break off its diplomatic relations with Sardinia but the publication of the Austrian and Sardinian

Pari and London friends. The dinomatic correspondencebetweenniema1ris na ondondisextremel active just now, but nothing of importance is likely
to be done by this Government in the Sardinian affair until after the return of the Emperor. The Yolksfreund, the organ of the IUltramontane paty, says the Emperor Francis Joseph could not with his qWln hand write a letter of condolence to King Victor Vemmanuel, " because that Monarch had ne-
glected to addrees to this Court an autograph letter
announcig the death of his consort, who was nearly reisted to the Emperor." * The Vienna paper adds, that an autograph notification of the doath

lUt it ttniken ie- thit- 1Thiawrot oreign t-= fairs wil find it excessively difficult to reply to it. General von Kartini, tho Austrian dLplomatic agent at Naples? haa recently informed lu Government that he is unable to obtain an audienoe of the King. It would seem that His MIajesty, who is greatly disgusted with the present policy of the peror Francs Joseph, is resolved not to receive any more advice from this Government. Not long since the Prussian and Russian Ministers expressed to King Ferdinand II. their conviction that it would be advantageous for the country if the diplomatic relations between Naples and the Western Powers were renewed, but the reply they received induced them to suppose that Mis Majesty was not of the same opinion.
It is believed at Berne that the Royalist fugitives at Morteau are about to make another attempt to obtain possession of NeuchAtel, but the diplomatic world does not share the apprehensions of the Swis. In fact, nothing could be more fatal to the King of Prussia's claims on Neuchatel than a repetition of the scene which took place in September, 1856. The Swiss, however, being of opinion that prevention is better than cure, have taken the necessary measures for protecting NeuchMtel against a coup de main.
Their Majesties are now at Mantua, where they intend to remain until the morning of Friday, the 6th. In the evening of the same day they will be at Verona. The7thwill bepassedat Treviso, the8that Udine, and the 9th at Gorice. The other part of the journey (by way of Monfalcone, Santa Crooe Sessana, Laibach, and Gratz) will be performed with
eat speed, but stiU the Imperial travellers will hrdly be able to reach Vienna before Wednesday, the l1th. The Grand Corso held at Milan on the 26th was a failure. Some of the high nobles threw "coriandoli" at the passers-by, and a few foreigners followed their example, but the whole affair was terribly flat, as the inferior nobility and the citizens remained completely passive. Their Majesties and the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian saw the Corso from the balcony of a palace belonging to the Marquis Saporiti, a Sardinian noble of great wealth. As soon as he heard that permission had been given to the public to throw " coriand oli," ML de Saporiti went to the Emperor and placed his palace at his disposal for Thursday and Saturday, the 26th and 28th of February. At the masked ball at the Scala on the 25th of last month the heat was extremely oppressive, but still the Emperor and Empress remained in their box for an hour and a-half. Some correspondents aEfrm that there never was a more magnificent masked ball at Milan, and it Is probable they speak the truth, for all the ladies in the boxea were in full dress and wore their jewels, and between 5,000 and 6,000 perons were m the other parts of the house. The ladies in the boxes amused themselves by dropping on the heads of the motley crowd below little parachutes to wilch papers containing " coriandoli" had been pfeviously attached. At 7 in the morning the masks were dancing with as much animation aS if the ball had but just commenced. I wish I could say that the Lombards met halfway the advances made to them; but, unfortunately, such was not the case.
The premium on silver haa fallen to 34 per cent.
THE ANGLO-PERSIAN TREATY.
The Paris correspondent of the Inddpendance Bedge publishes the following as the chief pointi of the Anglo-Persian Treaty just signed at Paris:-
" L The whole of the Persian territory which is or may be occupied by the English troops up to the proclsmation of peace in those parts is to be completely evacuated by the Englieh.
" II. Persia recognizes the independenoe of Affghanistan -that is to say, Persa makes a solemn engagement not to interfere any more in the affirs of Affghanistan.
" IIL Herat is restored to its independence. That province wIll henceforth be governed by its native rulers
"'IV. Renewl of the treaty of commerce ooncluded be. tween Persia and England. England will henceforth be treated in the Persian Empire on the footing of the most favoured nation; Persia equally so in the British Empire.
"<V. England renounmes henceforth affording protection Persian subjects.

LISBON, FB. 28.
Notwithstanding the vaunted progress in roadmaldng and other transit facilities the English mails by the Madrid packet, wrecked at Vigo on the 20th, only reached Lisbon yesterday morning, in charge of Lieutenant Thomas Tickell, who had to bring them on horseback to Coimbra, and thence to Carregado by the only section of railway yet opened in PortugaL The Portuguese papers Justly attributed the delay of these mails to the want of common facilities upon the roads, and they pay a well-merited tribute toLieutenant Tickell's acetivity, without which they would have been still longer on the way. It appears Lieutenast Tickell had the mails on shore at Vigo a quarter of an hour after theMadrid struck, that he lost his own baggage,and, proceeding at once to Oporto, continued theland route, by which he saved a day, as the steamer from Oportois only now coming up the Tagus. A sufficient number of horses was not to be had at many places on the road, and Lieutenant Tickell had to walk seven leagues between Agueda and Coimbra, besides suffering frequent want of proper nourishment. These facts, so discreditable to the country, are set forth in a Portuguese newspaper, and ought to be more applicable to the interior of the African colonies than to the Royal road between Lisbon and Oporto.
AdmiralDundas Is still here, with Her Majesty's ships Duke of Wellington, James Watt, and PrincessRoyaL The French ship Austerlitz is o in port. We have no steamer in port to take on the Madrid's mails for Cadiz and Gibraltar, but it has been arranged with the Peninsular and Oriental Company's agent that Lieutenant Tickell shall proceed with them in the first steamer, which will probably be the French boat Helvetie, expected hourly to call here, en route for Cadiz and Gibraltar.
In consequence of the irregularities in the mails and the want of a regular packet exchange, transactions have been more limited than usuaL London, at three months, was done at 53§. Some imnrovement has taken place in stocks, the Three per Cents. being now 461 to 46i registered; 4Zj to 45& Coupons; and 26 to 26* Deferred.
The Derbyite Meeting.
THEB DERBYTTE MEETING.
(From th,e Globe.)
Lord Derby had better have left corrections of the Press alone. Our readers of course remember the report which we copied last week, relating the solemn proceeding3 in the Conservative conclave, and doing so in a way to make it most imposing. With an " immense ingratitude" Iworthy of a Schwarzenberg, as our readers also remember, Lord Derby took the very earliest opportunity of rising in his place to "protest" against this "whoUly unauthorized', report. "It is," he said, "in manyinstances grossly inaccurate, and with regard to which I am represented, not only as saying what I did not say, but as saying exactly the reverse of what I did say." This rouuid assertion astonished us; and our mystification waa shared by many others who bad the best of aU right to judgo between the peer and the paper. The diffioulty was to divine where the *gross inaccuracy " lAy.
Our ill-used but adroit contemporary returns the thrust by a candid confession of the "gross inaccuracy." It seems to lie in two points. The meeting took place, not at Lord Derby's house in St. Jamlees-sqaare, but at Lord Eglinton's bouse in St. James's-square. And in lieu of saying that " he had had no commiunication with Mr. Gladstone on the subject," Lord Derby-as the Press reported In its second edition- spoke thusB-
"B He had no compact or understanding with Mfr. Gladstone as to any pohtical union. He and Mr. Gladstone were each perfectly free to act on any question without reference to the opinions of the other. At a lator period the noble Earl exprossed a hope that what he had said might not be misunderstood. He had had more than one oonversation with Mr. Gladstone on political matter, but, as he said before, there was no poltical arrangement or understanding between them."
Shakespeare speda of one who "lies like truth;" it ii possible also to tell truth with an opposite effect. A follower of tho noble Earl, who had been benignly mentioned by the Prew, evinced the same unaccountable ingratitude, and characterized the report as " an unauthorized distortion of the truth." Perhaps this gentleman, rnore faithful to Lord Derby than faith itself, ptefrs "an authorlzoddisortion of the truth "
But one not unirupottant fact comes out of ths oon troveesy provoked by Lord Derby wlth his own supportoe. The Coslition was further advanced than tke Pru: rep

BIRNGHAM, MILRce 7.
The usual weeklW meeting of pies interestedin the iron trade, on Thursday, was not numerously attended, but satisfactory accounts were given of the sate and pros ect
of the trade. It was anticipated that in the nonth of February the foreip demand for North America would be extraordinarily great; but up to the present time these anticipations have not been fulfilled. lopes were enterained by agents acting for London and Liverpool houses that purchases of manufactured iron might be nmade unon better terms than the prices of last quater; but in this respect they have been diappointed. Quotations are remarkably xirm, and there appears to be little doubt that the trade rates of the present will be those of the ensuing,quarter. The near approach of the spring quarterly meeting renders any alteration improbable before that period. Theprices of cest descriptions of mine pigs remain firm, notwithstanding the new furnaces in operation and the consequent incroased supply. There is a better demand for sheets and rods required by smiths and n,ilers; and this is so far indicative of an improved country trade at home.
There is nothing new to report with regard to the coal trae of the district. It continues active and pricm about the same as last quotedL The only event connected with this xmportaut branch of local production is the sale of the Pelsal Collieries by the astigees of Mr. Greene, late banker of Lxchfield, to Mr wardell, of Norton-in-theMoors, Staffordshire, for fl,500L The value of the collieries at the time of wr Greene's banrutcy as estimated to be doee upon 8O,O00., and It fs belireved that the bankrupt purchased theun fron the lessee of the South Stafforoihre Ralway at a price some thousands higher than theE amount for which the are now sold. The loss will be a serioups reduction of the dividends epected from the Lich-
Yost of the ironfoundries In the neighbourhood of Dudley are moderately well employed, but there are few heavy contracts in hand. In other manufacturing districts, although business is not over brisk, the men are generally well employed. The hollow-ware manufacture at Wegt Bromwic is decidedly improving, and at Redditch the needle trade is highly prosperous.
The various trades and manufactures of Birminghsm have undergone little change. The high prices recentlyesatbllshed are fullY maintsined, and all orders received for manufactures of which copper and tin are the materials are oonse-
uently extremely light. The factors state that the sheets
tited home by their representativescontainmore than the average demands for general hardware, but that there is a marked falling off in the call for brassfoundry goods. Braziers aud ironmongers wil not purchase beyond those which cormmand a ready sale and must of necessitv always be kept in stock. The light steel toy trade exhibits symptoms of renewed animation, and some manufacturers are extensively busy. Metallic bedstead making, the steel pen manufacture, electroplating, gas tubing, and other comparatively modern introductions are doinig Well, and the gun makersare busy for foreign markets. Depression appears to be chiefly confined to those branches of manufacture which are more particularlyinfluenced by the high price of metals, and to certain articles of jewel,at all times subject to the fluctuations and changes of fashion.
Notwithstanding ihe low state of the glass manufacture, more especially of table descriptions, a limited liabiiity company has been established to carry on theextensive works of Messrs. Harris and Son, now bankrupts, and great confidence is entertained of its success. There is more doing in the plate-glass manufacture, and the great establishments of the neighbourhoodatpresent afford moderAteemployment for their workpeople.
NOTfbGHA,L MXBCH 7.
The most pleasing feature to report with regard to the lace manufacture is that the finer descripUons of plain nets arein better demand than for some time past. These goods chiefly find markets in the East, which have long been glutted. Stocks there seem now, however to be cleared out, as large orders are being given, and tie trade promises to be extensive. Prices of these goods bAve been low as compared with the selling rates of coarse plain nets, but there is no doubt that the rates will become equalized, many machines having during the last two years been altered for the manufactulre of cosrse
oods that previously had been on with fine nets. mut few fine net mahines are now, therefore, in operation and the demand for coarse nets is likely to occupy all the machinery produscing them, and more, for some years to come. Coarse plain nets have again advanced in price. During the week the number of gene-al orders taken in the warehouses has not been large, but such as have been placed, combined with the orders previously planted and now executed, will make the returns for the past six dys something enormous in amount.
he home-trade buyers re now, in their several houses of business, retailng past sections to country shopk-eepera and others. If it were not for the fear of tbe spring and summer trades being affected by a geueral election, no doubt would be entertained of realizing one of the most prosperous years ever known. Great indination is expressed everywhere at the result of the xecent division on the China question.
There is a fair home trade business doing in hosiery, which would be nuch larger but for the effect of advanced prices of material. Yet there is plenty of employment. Stocks are very low, manufacturers working only to supply immediate wants. The trade gradually improves as spring approaches. All kinds of material are very high and firm mapnce.
LEEDS, XAIRCH 7.
AgreSt deal of caution appears to be exercised in the woollen cloth trade just now, and business has bcen less active. The wool-market occasions a good deal of parpEexity, and merchants are rather restricting their orders. T he Canadian trade is stl satisfactory, and there continums to be a considerable demand for some of the hght fabrics, in the manufacture of which but a very small proportion of wool is used. Until after the approaching general election the trade of the district wiUl prohbly be somewhat depressed. A good deal of business, however, was transacted m the cloth-halls this mor g considering that the extremely low stocks afford very little opportunity for choioe. The bulk of the goods disposed of consisted of mantle cloths, tweeds, and other mixtures suitable for the spring season. A few heavy materials were also sold, but the better descriptions of cloths were com?aratively neglected.
LEIC STEB, M .gCH 7.
Trade has slightly improved. For low cotton articles there is a tolerable demand, but in worsted and wooUen
oods the trade is exceedingly quiet. There are orders in te market from the United States. Yarns continue without reduction in price, Wools are without alteration. Upon the whole, trade is decidedly more healthy, and there are prospects of a better demand.
NORWICH, MLARC 7.
The shoe trade continues extremely active, The demand for the class of women's and chUdren's goods peculiar to the city is nabated, all the men bein employed; and large oraers are stated to have been refue in consequence of the inability to obtain hands to execuste them. The trade generally throughoult the country is reported by the London, NTorwich, and Northampton Boot and Shoe Company to be in a healthy condition, large orders having been received from te Austaan colonies.
BRADFORD, MARcH 7.
The worsted trade, notwithstanding political excitement,
is on the whol in a healthy condition. The quietest brauch I is the wool-market. Pnces of fine long-stapled wools, suited to combing purpoe, are firmly maintained, although transactions are not so extensive as of late - some descr. tions of Midland and Eastern Counties woof, of which the supply at m rket is on the increase, ray, however, be parchase dat a slight concession.

Foreign wools are in rather better suppl7 - still there is little prospect of these descriptions becomiig easier for some timeto come and manufacturers prefer purchasing only such quantitiesads arerequisite for the immediate requqre.
A further improvement is reported in the aspect of the trade for worsted yarm; spinners are enabled to obtaiu from the buyers a larger proporton of their requirements, but they stiU complain that the figures obtainable are in. sufficint to make the trade a profitable one. There is most doing in double-twist and angle-eft yarns for home consumption, at a sight enhancement in value.

She devised to t6e latter gentleman a freebold hotue in Cacutta, of the stimated alue of 5,000L, and bequeathed to the two persons who might be with her in ker ast illness 1,000. each; to the bureau of tho

Froeman and four cousms, or snch of themasabould be living at her decease Tiro of the latter died during her lifetime. The alidity of the will was impagned on £he ground that the deceased whose domitile oforign wss Anglo-Indian, and who umbsuently aoquired by the return of her far to Englad during her mmority an English domicle, had abandoned xach aoquired Englis domicile animo non rcUndi, and was both at the period of tbe execution of the wiU and at the time of her eath, which took place at Paxris on the 28th of April, h53; domiciled defacto in France according to the jut gcntium; and it wa submitted that the will, which was executed at Paris in accordanoo with the forms of the Wills Amendment Act, I Victorlx, acp. 26, and not in accordance with the forms presribed by the law of France, articles967 to 977 of the Code Napoleon, for the execution of wll in Frrance, whether of natives or foreigners, had consequently no force or efrect in law a a txesamentar disposition. A question srose as to whether or not the deeased had intermaried with Signor AIlegr, and had thereby acquired an Italian domicile but the ourt below held that the fact of the mamage had not been proved; that from the evidence it appeared that the deceased ws def wo domicled at Paris- that the law of England, as applioable to a case of this lind, was clearfamely that the will must be deemed good or bad accordiDg to aa Inr of Francs;, that it was neocsry, in order to establih such a domicile in that country as to affect the suoesmion of a testator and the mode of making wills, that that domicie should be by authorization, %nless there Wu naturaiimmti acither of which existed in this ease - consequentl, the deceased was entitled to the priviege oi rAinng annghlish will, end having done so, it was the duty of the Court to pronounoo for it. Amon other resons aigned by the appellant for the reversal ofthe jud t it was urged that the deceaecd was in fact domisg2 in France according tothe jus gentiimm, and, therefore, that the wil, not having been executed in conformity with the law of Franc ashto all tents and purpoes Invalid in law; that in Engs lgl procedure the law of a foreign country upon nXsubject Wma a matter of fact to be ascertnd by the evndence of witneses, and not to be collected or inferred from reasoning or investigation by the judge of the Englsh court; bt in the prment ee ir John Dodson had arrived at the eonclusion that the deceased was-entitled to make a will in the English form by a procem of reaning founded on the oplnions of certain writers on French law, and on the nature of the eases decided by the French tribunals; that theinferences dedue

ls; was an appeal from a decree of Vioe-Chanoellor Wood, relating to oertainbequesta in thewill of Anna aria Tempest, dated in 1849. The teeatrix thereby bequeathed certan charitablo legades, and directed that they zbould be " paid in precedence of the other pecuniary legaies thereby bequeathecdout of such part of herpersonal property not apecindlly bequeathed as was by law applicable for chatable purposes. The suit as one for the administtion of tbe estate of the tostatrix, and during its progross it was discovered that the pure personalty was insuificient to pay all the charitable bequests in full, and to bear its share of the debts and funeral and testamentary expenses. The testatrix left in addition a considerable personal estate, avouming of realty; and the Vice-Chancellor, under the circunstances4 held that the charitable legacies wero demontrative, and therefore on the authority of "Robinson T. Geldard' (3 IL. and G.), the debts, and funeral and testamentary expenses, and the costs of the suit for administration must be paid in the first instanco out of tho personal estate aavouring of reaty, so as to exonerate the puro personalty, and leave that fund intact for the charitable legacies.

This was an appeal from a decision of the Master of the Rolls made in a suit ingtituted to enforce forei judg rlent obtained in the Appellate Court at Celle, inanover. She Important question in dispute in the cause is what is the leffect in this country of a foreign judgment, that is, whether it binds the parties, or whether the courts of this country are bomnd to examine it, and, if so, to see how far its decision is correct. The case aroso with regard to a cargo of wheat, cond ed b Jansson, Widow, and Son, of Emdon, in Hanover, Trom Elbing, to Hennings and Co., in London, and respecting which various proceedings took place in the District Court of Emden, the Appellant Court of Aurich and the Appel Court at Celle, the ultimate decision being in fa^vour of Jansomn, Widow, and Co., for a sum of 16,240 Dutch gauiderm The bill was filed to enforce the judipnent, and the defenoo is that there is error on the face of it, for that the reasons appended to the decroe declared that the contract was to be construed according to the laws of Elst Friesland, the respondent considering that the law of England governed the case, and hence the question arose The Master of the Rolls dismiied tho bil on the ground of delay. The plaintiffs in the suit are Hemma Reimers and others, trading as Janson, Widow, and Son, the defendant being the executor of Mr. Henning's will.

This Knit was instituted by William Walker, and about 20 other persons, shareholders in the Newcsstle Commerial Banking Company (which was some time since made the subject of an application under the winding.un acts), against three persons named, Law, Badleir, and kennedy, for the spedfic perfomnceo of an agreement whereby the d fendants were to become manag ers nd directors of that concern upon cerin terms, one being that 4,000 shres sbould be transferred from parties wishing so to do, at 64 per ehare, of which option the plintiffs had taken advantage. The answer had been put in, and an application bad been mace by summons in chambers, that the plaintiff should produce documents writhin a fewr days of the filing of such answer. This wras objected to by the plaintiffs under the 20th section of the 16Sth and 16th of Victoria, cap. 86, on the ground that inch application could not be me
until a full and auffiLient answer had been put in-namely, six weeks They also tendered an affidavit by ldr.Walker, as representing the other plaintiffs, upon a statement in tho bill that he was their agent, whereas it appeared, as the defendants alleged, that such authority was only s a vague correspondence; it was therefore submitted by the defendants that an answer, if sufficient, was so from the moment it was filed, and the practice had been, in all the Chief Clerks' offices to allow similarapplications to the present before the six woeks expired. In a case of " IAfone v. The Falkland Island, Compny" (2. Kay and Johnstone) Vioe-Chancellor Wood decided that a full and sufficient answer meant " to which no exception had been bskend.
Mr. Little appeared for the defendants.
Mr. GLASS and Mr. ROXBUIGU8 for the plaintiffS, irged that the six weeks must ase before the application [or document.' could be made. lth regard to the affidavit it was for the Court to decide.
The VtciR-CnAuCMLOR said that had the matter come before him personally, which it had niot, he should have anllowed the matter to stand over for such timo as was reasonable, that ths plaintiff's counsel rnight considet whether the answer was open to exception. An answer was iftfiCent from the mnonment it was filed, and under the 19th and 20t sections of the 15th and 16th of Victori, chap 86, the Cort had power, even after exceptions taken ano6allowed, so make au order for production of doctments The defendant iad therefore a fight to take out a summons for iucl production iniiediately after the filing of the avner.

Mr. Justice Cresewell concluded the criminal business on Thursdy evening, and this morning he disposed of a common jmry case, and his Court ws then adjourned.

flEnnrLETIIWA V. CLAYDON.
This WUs * wW cause, and it occupied two entire days, and was not concluded until late on Friday evening.
Mr. IL Chambers, Q.C., and ldr. Petersdorff were coanstI for the plaintiff; Mr. E. James, Q C., and Mr. Hannan appeared ior the defendant.
The action was broupht in tho form of an ejectment, but tho real question at issue was vhether an old farmer, named Henry Hebblethwaite, was in a competent state of n,ind in June, 1851, when he made his will, to execute an instrument of such a character. The property consisted of a Fmall farm at Great Sampford, in this cornty, which was stated to bo worth about l,OOO., and it was admitted that the plaintiff would have been entitled to it as heir-at-lsw but for the will in question, under wrhich it would pass to the defendant; and the onus of provnng the will being upon him, evidence was 6r.st given to make out that the testator was in a competent condition of mind to know what he ws doing when he executed the wil, and ws aware of the effect of the lestrument. Nearly 20 vwitneates were examined on each side, and tho evidence as to the condition of mind of the deceased and his general habits was moet conflicting.
Mr. JAmsRS made a most able reply upon the whole case, and
Mr. Baron CUANNILL having summed up the evidence with very great minuteness
The jury, fter some deliberation, returned a verdict for the defendant, tbereby establishing the validity of the will. nRx QUEEN ON TIrE PROSECUT'ION OF - IILLS V. JOHIN
CUMS AND ROBERT EZEKIEL 8MISTll. This was A proswution for misderieanour.
Mr. IL Chambers, Q.C., Mr. Lush, and Mr. Itodwell appeared for the Crown; Air. Serjeant Shee and Mr. WoolIett defended Cuttg; and Mr. Edwrin James, Q.C., and Mr. Prentis appeared for the defendant Smith.
The eircumstances of this case have created a good deal of interest in the county from the peculiar circumstances connected with it, and the podtion of the parties. The indictmont against the defendants was framed under an Act of Parliament known as the "Bishop of Oxford's Act," and the offence imputed to them was having procured a young
irl named Marthl Augusts&Hil4, under 21 years of age, to eedebauhed. It appeared that Miss His s the daughter of a farmer, and that she had three years ago become acquainted with the defendant Smith, who is also a farmer and a man of property, residine at Finch. ingfield, in this county, and that the result of their intimacy was the birth of a child. Miss Hills, who is stated to be a very handsome young woman, subaequently went to reside at a plae called Coleman's, with the defendant Smith; and it appeared that two actionm, one for seduction and the other for breach of promise of marriage, were brought against Mr. Smith by the father of the young lady, but thoy were sottled by the payment of 501. and an uL ertaLdng to pay the costs. Mr. Cutts is an attorney, and a man of considerable property, who lives at Bardf6eld, hall, and he, It appeared, acted as the attorney for Mr. Smith in these matters, and Mr. Shepherd, an attorney at Halatead represented the friends of the Young lady, and it would seem that in the course of tho proceedings an agree ment of a very extraordinary character was mnde, whlic
was to the effect that if the young lady would return to the residenoe of Mr. Smith, and reside there as "sheretofore" for a pcriod of eightfmonths, belundertook to marry her at the expiration of that period; but it was under a condition that this agreement should not be shown either to her father or to her legal adviser. By some means, however, it appeared that Mr. Shepherd came to the knowrledge of Such an agreemntnt being inaexstence, and, as MSr. Smith appeared not to havo carned out hig promise to marry the young lady, the present indictment was preferred against the defendants at tLe laet assizes, and a true hiU found by the grand jury, it bEng alleged that both the defendants were parties to tho agreement referred to, and that they bad thereby brought themselves within the scope of the Act of Parliament in question. The case was remeved by ccrtiorari by the do-
iendauts,and it wa appo inted to be tried byaspecialjury at these asises, and they were both now in attendanoe ready to take their trial.
Mr. CHANuERS u.Pon the case being called on put in several affidavits, and he said that upon the facts stated in the"Aeaidavite he hato apply to the=~t order the trial to be postponed to the next asasie,%
MLr Baron CIuAiNXLL diretetd the affidavits to be read
They were aocordingly redy the officer of tliCourt. 2heTnb t lras an a Vt'A ma0o Mr. Owen, a surgeon. vho stated that he had that morning seen Martha Augusta Hills at the residence of the defendant Smith, and that she was in &very far advanced state of pregnancy, and that he considered it utterly unsfe for her to come to Chelmsford to give evidence in tis cause, and ihat it would endnpr her life to do so. Thi gentlem ala ted that when he mw the ing lady hoe expredsed her wlrlinuem to attend asa witnes, and said that she would do o i se kneow that she
should ot return die, aid wen k came &Wy he wa under the impreesiont that se woBbelin Mateadanee. The r ext *davt that wa reed was one mada by Mr. Shepherd
t'ie attorney for the prosecution, in which he stated thIt the said Makrtha Augusta ~IlMs was a maaterial and necemary witness for the prosecution, and that he was advised by counsel that the ends of juatice -were likely to be frtustratedL it he proceeded to the trial of the indictment witAobt her evidence. An affidavit Made by a person named Cwhdinol,
lclrk to M1r. Shepherd, was likewise read, which statea tht
froim having beea preent at tbe consuitation of cownelnand 'wbat lhe heard upon the occasion he believhed that Miss Hillswas a6material and necessary witncesfor the prosecution, ando hatonTucadaylast he proceeded to themesidenceofMrd . Smith, and having knocked at the door and waited soh e time, thedoorwas partly opened by an elderly woman, who told hial that she dared not adidiit any one when i ar. Smith was absent, and upon his tellig lher that he had 00'he to see Miss Ehlls abdut ber going to Chelmsford as a witness, she told him that she was very ill and that she expected her to be confined every hour, and the affidavit also expressed a belief that the said Martha Augutsta Hills was under the restraint of the defendant Smith.
I The counsel for the defendants put in counter affidavits
inanswer to the statements contained in those that were madeo on behalf of the prosecution. One was an affidavit made by Mr. Catts, in which he stated that the indictment before the Court had not been preferred for the purposes of of justice, but solely from a vindictive feeling, and he referred to a letter written by Mr. Sheperd, in which he asked for the payment of the cort; that had been incurred in the actions brought by the father of Miss Hils, sod also that Mr. Smith should make an agreement to marry the aoung lady within a nriod of two months. He stated that after. this Mr. Shepherd claimed a sum of 891. for costs, dwich he considered *as an exorbitant demand, and he therefore refuased to pay it, and after this the present indictmen- -was preferred. The affidavit twenet on to state pethat there were no real grounds for postpon in the trial, n that Miss Hills could not be a material witnes inadsmuch as her name was not upon the back of- the bul atnd she was mot examined as a witness beappore the grad jury. The other defendant, Robert Ezekiel Smith, also made an affidavit, in which he stated that Martha Auigusta Hlills was at the present time living at his house voluntarily and of her own accord; that whe had horns him one ehilds.ad was at the present time pregnant of soother by him ;-that she was no party to the present indictaent, and, in fact, disapproved it altogether- and thati he was not aware of any such chasle being prederred unti after the hil was founde ; and the affidavit lkewle expressed the belief of the defendant that the in-ictment was not pref rred for the purpose of furtbering the ends of justice hut with the object o extort mnoniey.
Mr. tBaron Cand asto after a short deliberation, said it appeared to him that upon the facts before the. Court the tral should be postponed.
Mr. Serjeant Sigre said he hoped his Lordship would permit himeto say a few words before he flnaUy decided upon
r.ostponing the toial. The defendants, as his Lordship was aware, were charged with having uanlawfully procured the dEfilement of a young woman, but it was perfectly clear that the young woman herself, who was the peron supposed to be injured, was no parti to these proceedings. He also raid it was evident that the charge was not preferred until Mr. Shepherd, the attorney, found he could not obtain the araount of coats that he claiued. He submitted that, under the circumstances, there was no real ground ifor ostponing the trhi; and as to Miss Hls being a material witness, it appeared to him that if she were so she would have been taken before the grand jury, and that the trial was merely postponed for the purposes of vexation and annoyance, and that it would be a great grievance and hardshilp upon the defendant if such a course was adopted.
Myr. EDWIN JAsnES, on behalf of the other defendant, also obje ted to the postp nement of the trial, and he observed there could be no doubt that dr. Shepherd was the real prosecutor, and that neithe- Miss Eills nor her father had anything to do with preferring the a resent charge. With regard to the agreement that had een referred to, atr. Shepherd ap ared to have had as much to do with it as any of the osaer parties, and he might ans wel have beei included in the indictment.
Mr. CHAssBERS in reply, said that Mr. She pherd ha done no mrore in conexion with these proceedings than became him in his position of an attorne ad that his conduct had been honest and proper. Mr. Spherd had never suggested any such a thing as that the patties were to live in concuhinage, hut his object undountedly was that the defendant Smith should fulfi his promiteto marry the young lady, all the proceedings he had taken were in the srict
d alrge of his duty. With regard to the present prosecution, the father of the young lady was the pro-ecutor, and it
appeard to him that the application for a postponemIent of the tvr, on the ground of the abseice of a material witness, was one that was quite In the ordinary course, and that no grounds had been shown why it should omot be secededL to.
Mr. Lusu followed on the same side and said that the indictment was preferred at the very earliest moment sater it was discovered that the defendant Smith did not intend to pserform his promie to marry the young lady. He also sai that if it was true that Miss Hills was no party to this poe an dad from her to that effect might have bee easil obafine.vt
Mr. ae said he still thought lie ought to -postpone the trial.
An apsplcation was then made on behalf of the defendants for the costs of the postponement.
hr. Baron CndrhElr. expressed an opinion that they were entitled to the additional expense that would be cast upon them by fthe otra being postponed.
Mr. Ci,rnn said, if this was mnade a condition of the postponement ho was afraid the ends of justice might be defeated, as the father of the young lady, who was the prosecutor, was not in a condition to pay the costs. Ho urged, however, that, this being in reality a pro-ecuition by the Crown, the Court had no power to make an order upon the -nominal prosecutor for paymDent of costs.
Mr. Baron CHAeNm L said, he should not make it a condition of the postponement of the trial, but esthought that, under the circutinauces, the proveautor ought to pay the costs. He should therefore make an order to that effect, hut, of course, if he hadenot the power to make such an order the prosecutor would not be bound by it.
The recognizances of the defendants were then renewed, and the trial was ordered to stand over to the next aelsizes.

DA.VIS V. TUCK.
This was an action to recover damages for Wa libels, publishe in the testimonTiames newapaper.
Mr. Hawkins and Mx. Prenta a red for the plaintiff ; and Mr. E. James, Q.mC.hand har. Lsh were counsel for the' defendant.
It appeared from the opening of Mr. Hawkins that the plaintst;who had formerly been in the service of the Great WesterniRailway, was at the time of the puablication of the libelain estion engaged in a responsible position at the Bishopcgarte station of the Eastern Counties Railway. It wil be remembered that during the last year Mr. Waddington, the chairman of the company, resigned thatipost,
an PtI appeared that the plaintiff took an active part in endeavouring to induce the servants of the company to presentates, timonial In some shape or other to that gentleman npon his retiring. This proceeding, it appeared, Edid not mneet the approval of the then beard of directors, and some intimation to that effect was conveyed to the plaintiff, and in the result the idea was abandoned. The libels com-
laed. of appeared in the reailay Times of the 13th and 7th of Se tember, and in the first it was sitated that the plaintiff had been reprimanded and threatened with dismisslin consequence of the proceedings he had taken
to get up the te stioal, and the second article eipressd a hope that the plaintiff would return any money that ho maight have 'extorted from hls fellow-servan's in furtasthenc of the getting up of the testimonial. Mr. Hawkins said that, under these ecir ciiKstances, as the pefendant had never offered to withdraw either of the offensive observations or to makeo any apoIogy, the plaintiff had no alternative hut to bring the present action, his only object, however, being the vit,dication. of his character. He also stated that the plaintiffbhad resigned hins appointment upon the railway in concequence of the annoyance that had been occasioned him by the publication of these articles.
Mr. Baron CxTAIZMeixL said it appeared to him that, as the object of the plaintiff was merely to vindicate his character, that object would be attained by the defendant now withdrawing the imnputations complained of.
Mr. J&AMES said he was quite ready to do this on the part of the defeindant. There never was any intention to impute to the plaintiff that he had exterted money in the ordinar~ sense of the term, but merely that he had used his official position to induce the servants of the company to subscribe to thec testimonial, He would therefore consent to a verdict f or the plaintiff that wouxld carry costs.
A verdict for 40s. was then taken for the plaintiff. This was thelast cause for trial. The commission for the county of Kent will be opened to-day at Maidstone.

DAVISOX V. DUNCAN AND ANOTHER.
Mfr. Atherton, Q.C., and Mr. Manisty appeared for the plaintiff; btr. Hill, Q.C., Mr. Overend, Q.C,, Mr. Unthank, aud Mr. Farrer for the defendants.
This was an action for libel brought against the publishers of the Durhams Adverti;cy, and it has acquired some noto. 2iety by reason of one of the defences set up being that the supposed libel was a true and faithful report of what actually happened and took place at a public meeting. For this ra. stn we state the pleadings more fully than is asual.
The declaration comp'ained of the following article in the Durham Cotunty Advertiser of the 9th of October last:-

The plaintiff laidliis damatges at l,0O0Z.
The defendants pleaded, 1st, ,Not Guilty ;"' 2d, that the woxds and matters contained in the libel were true and fdly, that a public meeting of the West Hartlep,.ol Commin
sioners was in fact held for putting into execution the Inprovement Act, and that the facts, mattprs, circumstances, and things in the liastatedto have tktn plaa c and thappened at that meeting did take place and happen as therein slleged ; and that tbe, alleged libel contained a just, true, faihfu, ad acurte epot o th sae,and was printe and pblised wthou malie onthe otenanLts' part.

Mr. ATrERTOS stated the case. -He said,-The plaintiff is a solicitor in Durham, and for some years previous to the resignation of Bishop Mdaltby was his Lordship's secretary. Tke defendants are publshers of the Durham Advetiscr. The libel of which the plaintiff complain appeared in that newspaper of the 9th of October last, and purported to be a report of the meeting of the West Hartlepool Improvement Commissioners held on the 7th of that month. Thefaictsto which the report and the discucsion at the meeting referd were as to the grant of a license to bury in a cemetery at West Hartlepool. In the Improvement Act for that place there is power to make a cemetery. The 60th section provides that the minister for the time beingof Christ Church, inWest Hartlepool, shall, by himself or his curates, officiate at burials in this cemetery. It became necessary that a portion of the ground should be consecrated. A petition, dated the 20th of June last, was presented to the Bishop for consecration. It recites the above section of the Improve. ment Act. The first signature is that of the Rev. Mr.2Ridley, Vicar of Stranton, witbin which parishWest Hartlepool ly. The next signature is that of the Rev. John Hart Burges, minister of Cbrist Church, and then comes the commnon seal of the Improvement Commimsioners. On the 15th of Deeemn ber, 1855, the late Bishop had executed a power of attorney, or commis-ion, to the Bishop of Manlchester, ArcSdeacox Bland, and the Rev. Mr. Douglas, to execute his fhnctlons, Soon after the consecration of the chapel Mr. Davibon pro. pared the nsual license to bury, but left a blankforthe name of the clergyman to be licensed. Bein g aware bf the commission, Mr. Davison forwarded the. icense to<dr. Gresley, of Bishop Auckland. Mr. Gresley handed the license to Archdeacon Bland, who on the 27thaofnSed toe
ber brought it to Mr. Davison's office in Durham, with the blank still remaining. Archdeacon Bland,'acting under the commission, and intending to. execute the license, ave in. structions to Mr. Davison that the blank should be filled up with the name of the Rev. John Hart Bntges. The Archdeacon then signed the license, describing himself as commissary of the Bishop. The libel imputes tbat Mr. Davison had induced the Bishop of Durham to execute the license under the impression that the licensee was mot the Rev. Ir. Burges. In truth the Bishop never executed the license at all. [Mr. Atherton here read the repbrt complained of.) It imputes that the plaintiff, taking ad vantage of the infirmities of an aged prelate, practised upoun him a gross fraud for tho purpose of serving Mr; Burges, The letter referred to, as comin from Aucklanid, purported to have been written by the Rev. Mr. Maltby, the soni of the late bishop. There is a plea on this record which bas made this case world-famous. Although this report Wa1y bave been brought by a reporter to the defendants' Qfce ll the usual way, yet affecting, as it did, the character of a person so long resident and well-known in this city as the plaintiff, it would have better become the defendants not to publish such a report without previous inquir, an4 affording an opportumty to Mr. Davison tD puba at the same time his explanation. It may be said why does not the plaintiff seek redress from the Rev. i. NAltby,
here letter contains the sting of the libel? But it wad not Mr. Maltby who caused the great injury that the plAdn; tiff sustained. That letter was intended by the writer tobl
conined to the board-zoom of the West Hartlepool c i. provement Commissioners. Moreover, the communicatio
yMr.Maltby might well be contended to be pnrvile id, unless personal malice on his part could be shown. she action was commenced in October. It was not till the 2dl of Decemiber that they put on the record their pleas. They had all November to inquire into the truth of the facte. ILnstead of that, they on the 2d of December plead that the charge against Mr. Davison, that he practisea d. ception on the aged prelate whom he had Eeived so many years, was true. They are then in this dilemma;-either they inquired into the facts and ascertained the falsity of these accusations, and wilfully persist in the slander; -or, no' having inquired, they recklessly and hap-hazard put this plea upon thte record. The defendants also plead thatt tbey are not guilty of the publication. There can be no douath
that they did publish the newspaper. I now come to the vorld-famous plea-one wbich naturaUl, has excited much interest amoDg public journalists. This third plea asse:rt
that the publication was a correct report of what took place at the meeting of the Improvement Commissioners. It may wel be questioned whether it is pro,cer that a journal like the defendants' should givepublicty to defamatory speeches, dictated probably by malice. In the parish where the slander is uttered the plaintiff's character may be too well known toe injured* but at a dist-ance where the journal circulates, that maynotbe s
Alr. bavison's advisers, therefore, took the beio so, b Court of Queen's Bench. That Court decided that the reports of the mneetings of the HartAlepool Commiitsioners however august the proceedings of that body might be were not privileged like reports of proceedings of courts ol justice, or, it may be, of the Houses of Parlia* ment. But Mr. Davison has not only obtainedl the judge ment of the Court that this plea is bed in law, but he has also denied the truth of it in point of fact. It is not a fait report of what took place. It is true that at the mieeting the heense to Mr. Burges was read, but it is not true that it purported to be a license from Bishop Maltby. If the circumstance that the license was signed and sealod by Archdeacon Bland had also been reported, then the letter ot Mr. Maltbyas to the late Bishop having been deceived would evidently have appeared to be written under some mistake. The report Is as unfair in the wav of-suppression as the Court of Queen'a Bench have decidedit to be unsound, in law. The Iarned counsel concluded by calling on the jury by their verdict to mark their sense of the defendant? conduct in abusing the privileges of the press, and to vindicate the plaintiff's character.
Mr. HILz here stated that, the plaintiff having in his answer on oath to certain interrogatories denied the truth of the imputations, he (Mr. Hil, on behalf of the defendants, abandoned the second plea, whicb, by way of justification, alleged the truth of those imputations, but was prepared to contend that the publication was no libel.
The new apor was thlen put in.
Mr. W. Wilkinson Brunton examined.-I am clerk to the West Hrttlepool Improvement Commissioners. Thisis a copy of the license read at the meeting. [Thb license was put in. It was in the name of Bishop Maltly, but was signed by Archdeacon Bland as commissary xpecially ap-
Cross-examinedby3r. HILL.-Mr. Emerson, Mr. Ramn say, Mr. Caseborn, the Rev. Mr. Ridley, Mr. Walker, Mr. RMchardson, and Mr. Pyle were there. Mr. Jackson sald, "With the Bishop's seal specially attested." Upon its being read several commissioners expressed their surprise and astonishment, and said tbat no petition for euch license had been presented. The chairman asked if I had madeany application for the license. I believe some of the commissmoners said that they could not understand the necessity for such a document. I tbink it was repro. sented by the chairman that Mr. Ridley, tho vicar of Stranton, was jthe proper person to officiate, and that it appeared a clumsy device of Ir. Davison to give Mr. Burge a legal statu& I think MIr. Ridloy said he had that morning received a reply from Auckland Castle, and read a letter o t e effect stated in the newspaper report. I believe he said the letter was from Canon Maltb,y, the resident chaplain of the Bishop. One of the commissioners observed that it sTppeared that the wbole proceeding had been afraud uponthe
ishop as well as upon the public. Another commissioner said e thought it was a great scandal on the church, and Mr. Ridley said it was only a scandal on Mr. Joseph Davison. A resolution was passed according to the report. I have been clerk to the commissioners since the commencement of the board in 1854. The first commissioners. are %naned in the Act. A third go out every year, and their places are supplied by election by the ratepayers and owners of property. Their meeting are held every other weekr, and for the last}year and a-fhave betn atteded by the reporters for the public press, and the proceedings reported.
Mr. Peilo p reduced the petition for consecration, dated June 20, pr6,from the Rev.Richabard Ridley. vicar of Stranton ; Rev. John Hart Burges, incumbent of Christ Church, West Hartlepool; and the Improvement Commlssioners. I was present at the consecration on the 23d of June by the Bishop of Manchester. This (producing it) is the commission from the Bishop of Durham, dated Deoemn. ber 15,1855, to the Bishop of Manchester, Archdeacon Bland, and the Rev. Henry Douglas, as commissaies, among other things, to sign such licenses as might be required.
The Rev. Mr. Burges produced the original license to himself, datedI September 7,1856, under the seal of the Bishop, and signed by George Bland, commissary speoially ap. pointed.
ThY Ven. Archdeacon Bland identified the commission and theicense. He said,-Ireceivedtbolioensewithotherlicend
from Mr. Gresley, the bishop's steward. This was the first
that I had to do withf this license; when it wasbnded to I C,
me Mir. Burges's name was not inserted in it. There was a blank left for the name. On the 27th of September I tok it in that state to Mr. Davson's office. Ho was secretary to the late Bishop. I directed him to insert the name ofthe Rev. John Hart Burges, B.A., as incumbent of Christ Church, West Hartlepool. I was aware that the cemetery had been consecrated upon the petition already described.
The name was inserted while I was at the office, and after It was inserted I sined the license. After the meeting at West Hartlepool I sa w the Bishop.
Cross-examined by Mr. HmTT-1 believed that I was carrying out the Act of Parliament. There was an unseemly controversy as to Mr. Br=ge's position at HartlepooL I do not use the word " unseeIly with reference to the character
MrI W. lackson, clerk to the plaintiff, proved tbat. he filled up the license with the name of Mr. Burges.
This closed the plaintiff's evidence, and Mr. ATr zRToN summed up bis case, contendingthat, upon theplea of " Not Guily" and the plea alleging the truth of the imputatiOns
the verdict must unquestionably be for his client. He nlso contended thatthe last plea was not proved in point of fact. Mr. Brunton aid that the chairman told the meeting that the license was under the Bisboj)'s seal spcially attested. That the seal was specially attested was not stated.'
Mr. Hrr, for the de ence, made a short but forcible
speech to the jury. He comm;enced by repeating his with-I drawal of the plea of justification of the truth of the supposed libel. But the fact was that the license *as ent to Aueckland fok the Bishop's seal to li, affixed, while ho blankc Still remained, It was sealed, and with the blank still remaining was sent to Archeacon Bland.

of October, the writ is issued on the 16th of October. The alleged libel ix a true report of what toolc place at the meeting. Thelettereof Csnon l althy purp rting to have been there read, has been proved to have bien r'ad. It was well said in a recent case by Lord Campbell that DoW, when pasties may he witnesses in tbeir own behalf, there is no such thing as a witness bringing an action to clear his character and shrinking from getting into the witness-box. It was the duty of the defendants to publish the proceedings of public bodies having the power of local taxation and other matters of local government. The o secietyso require. Sixty years ago it was declared by Fofs Libel Act that the judge may or not state to tbe jury his o; inion whether a pnblication is a libel or not, but it is for the jury to decide the question. I say that this is not a libel. But there is another issue. Is this a correct and true report of the meeting, and publi-hed without malice ? There can be no question but that it was. As to damages the plaintiff has asked for no explanation, but has rushed into law and seeks to oppress the defendants, and imagines that by doing that he will justify his character. Mr. Hill concluded a forcible address by calling om the jury, if they 'were obliged to give the plaintiff a verdict, to award him the smallest coin i the resim.
The learned JunoB summed up. There could be no doubt, his Lordship said, as to the fact of publication. A libel consists of a written publication of matter injurious to the character of anyperson. This publication imputes fraud to the plaintiff, and is not a privileged communication. Publishers of newspapers have no more right than other people to print matter injurious to the character of others. It is very well tbat this is the law, because, if not, this plaintiff would have had no opportunity of coming forward to disprove the truth of the matter alleged against him. Its untruth is now admitted by The defendants handsomely enough. If you are satisfied that this publication is a libel, you must assess the damages. But there is an issue joined upon the last plea which you must dispose of, because, altbough the Court of Qieen's Bench has decided that plea to be bad. yet a Court of Error my hold that it is a good defence. There is no obligation on the press to publihh matters of this kind, so as to protect them in the way that a man is protected in giving what he beleves to be a true character of a servant. Proceedings in courts of justice may also lawfully be published. The charge that the plaintiff bad attempted a fraud npm the bishop and the publi is in my opinion, libellous. It is said tbat you should consider tho conduct of the plaintiffin mte se.lainmg the matter to the defendants before bringing
action. Generaly it is best not to answer a newspaper attack, for you often get the worst of it. A letter of xplanation may be followed by another attack more hurtfulthan the first. Still, when the libel is published evidently under a mistake of facts-a mistake into whichnewapaper editorv, like other people, may fall-it is for you to say whether it would not have been better for the plaintiff to have given the defendants an opportunity of rectifying that mistake. As to the last issue (upon the third plea), the plaintiff complains that the report does not sufficiently state that the bishop did not sign the license himself. The report gives the purport of the license and a nezwspaper does not always profess to gite every word of a document. Again, it is said that the report ought to have stated that the chairman said that the license was, " with the bishop's seal, specially attested." You can hardly say that the facts stated in the repozt did not take place. Then, was there reasonto think that the defendants had malice ? The only evidence of malice is the persisting in the plea that the imputations were true. Do you think that shows the reporter, too, meant an unfair report 7 If not, and you think that the newspaper gave a correct report of the meeting, you must find that issue for the defendants. Upon the plea of " Not gts " I must repeat that it is no defence that the supposed ibels a correct report of what took place at a public meeting.
The jury retired for an hour, and then returned with .a verdict for the plaintiff on the two first issues-damaie; one farthingi and for the defendant on the last sune, being of opinion that the report was correct, and published

This action was brought to recover damages for a malicions arrest. It appeared that the plaintiff was a commnis. soagen t liVing at Stockton-on-Tees, and had been employe by defendant to sell guano for him, and also to collect debts, for 'which the plaintiff was paid a commission and his travellig expenses. n appeared that in June, 1855, a Mr. Wilkinson, a farmer, had verbally ordered, through the plaintiff, some guano of the defendant, who, however, by some mistake, had sent some bone manure. As Wilkinson lived at some distance from the defendant, the defendant requested him to let the manure remain on his premises until he could find a purchaser for it, and the defendant sent a letter to the plaintiff, requestin bim to sell it. The manure remained at Wilkdnson's till September, 1856 when it was sold to a Mr. Swales l.y the plaintiff, who tnen received the money for it. The plaintiff in his evidence stated that at that time there was a balance due to him from the defendant for commissic n and travelling expenses, and that shortly after the sale of the manure he had met the defendant at Stockton, and told him of the sale and receipt of the money, and requested him to charge the money against his (the plaintifis) account. Under these circumstances the defendant caused the plaintiff to be arrested by 'warrant on a charge of hvn obh tained this manure by false pretences, and the pai c sed was taken fmpom Stockton to Thirsic, ad there put into gaol, and kept there for one niht; after which he 'wa lans

One of those men was the prisoner; and upon Parkes COming up to them he asked whether they were going to leicester. The prisoner replied uYes ;" and upon beiny asked mhence they came, he said, "From Hinckley." Pr 'es then said, '1 believe you oere at Croft yesterday," bat the prisoner denied that statement. He also denied thathe had anything in the basket which he was caring: but on openiDg it ri wras found to conhin the bottle which had been stolen at Croft the previous day. The prisoner was then requested to go into the house of aMr. Tilley close by, and consented to do so, but immed ately afterwards ran off in the direction of Leicester. He was pursued and caught by Parkes, nd was then told that he would be taklen into custody on suspicion of commiting the robeery. A violent struggle ensued, in te course of which the prisoner fired a pistol at Parkes, and e close to his face hat his whiskers were singed. le caled out "1Murder !' and "bMfr.

Mr. lPoulden was counsel for the prosecution, and Mr. R. T. Cole defended the prisonemrs
This was a prosecution direced by the Lords of the Admiralty, underthefollowingrcumsanoes --It appeared by the vicdence on the part of the proeecution that a seaman named Ellis was a captain's coxswain on board the Intre id; he had for eome time been living with a girl n=me Jane Sowden, and on his going to sea be made an allotment of his wages, to the amount of 2L a-month, in favour of Jane Bowden. By the regulations of the Admiralty, if a person to whom an allotment had been mide became sick or il1, the money might be obtained by another person appointed by the sick person to receive it for her in the following manner --An application was to be made to the pay-office for a form, which was called a sick certificate. This form was to be fied upandsgna by the sick persn,the siga ture to be wmtnessed and the fact of the person being ekt,
be certified by a mEson,anpnd on presntsDgthat forb i to the pa-office properly fled up the mioney was to be paid to the applicant. lIn the presnt came the usual sick certificate
,roperlyeertifed by a surgeon in favour of the prisoner
ow presed by her at the pay-office on the 5th of December, and the 21. were pad to her, the signature of Jane Sowden being attsted bythe pier Fryer. It wa
sabseqently discovered that Jane Sowden had died on the 5th of December, and had been an inmate of the insane ward of the Goapot mUion since the 3dT of September, beintafihictea with ddiriu7mirmcnasbrougbton by drikin. UJnder these circumstances, it was alleged on the part of the proection that the certificate could not have been signed by Jane Sowden, bnt must have been forged, especially as it conidhe proved that neither of the prisoners had seen Jan Sowdabn esnce the>Thureday wveekpre~ iol5ot
In the cross-examnination of the witnewes for the prosecntion it was elicited that these sick certificates might hare been obtainedrior to the day on which the wageswere patable, they bemig pyable on the first dayof every mont, and it was also shown on the cross-examination of the nurseoftheinsne wardof the union that the prisoners were in the babit of goingto see Jane Bowden every Thursday, which was the Tlsitin day at the union, an were accustomed to take her grocerics, gin, &c., and also to give her money; and it also a*ppeared that Jane Sowden had for some time prevous to goig ito the union lived at the house of theprisonerryer. The nurse admitted that on many occasons when the prisoners were there she had Ieft them with- Sowrden, under the care of the assistant nurse, who had acces3 to pen and ink. The assistant nurse ws not called.
Under these circumstances Mr- CoLEcontended thatinali probability the oertificate had been igned by the peceased woman to enable the prisoners, who were her friends and kind to her, to obtain the money, that they might provide her with the neesaries they were in the habit of bringing htr. At all events, the cse was left in so much doubt by the absence of the asstant nurse that the jury would not be justified in connicting the prisoner.

COGLA V. LA MERT.
Mr. Whateley, Q.C., Mr. Keating, QC., and Mr. W. H. Cooke appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Serjeant Pigott and Mr. Phipson for the defendant.
Thiswas an intespleader issne, to try whether a horse, named Gemma dli ergy, seized by the sheriff for Berkshire on the 9th of February, 1857, under an execution against the Hon. Fncis lAwley, was the property of the plaintiff, Charles Coglan, as against the defendant, Joseph IA Mere
It appeared that Coglan was a defaulter on the turf, living at No. 2, St. Marys-plaoe, Brompton, and the defendant, La Merl, was a billiscounter in Albemarle. street, Piccadilly, and abo practising there as a quack doctor under the name of Curtis and Co. The issue related to the property in a horse called Gemini di Vergy, which at one time belonged to William Palmer, of Rugeley, who was hir_ged, and which was sold with the rest of Palmer's stud at Tattersall's, in January, 1856. It was purchased by a racing man naned Hargreaves for 100 or 105 guineas, and plaeed by him at Dawson's, the trainer'; at ]Isley. It was kept there till the27th of arch, 1856, when Hrgreaves sold it to the Hon. 3fr. Iwley for 500., and, according to the plaintiff's evidence, LAwley, on the 21st of June, soldthe horse to Coglan for 6401 Coglan was anlrishman, who bad come over to this country and engaged in transactions on the tur4 which in due course ended in his becominga *defaulter, and tang the benefit of the Insolteut Act In order to show that Coglan had become the boi%d fde purchaser of the horse it was proved tha, though he had become insolvent in 1851, he bad won considerable sums of money by bets upon horses in October, 1855. In that month he had opened an account with lfesss
Herries, Farquhar, nd Co., the bankers, and in the course of the month had paid in as much as 1,800., the amount of his winnings. On the 9th of June, 1856, he had drawn out a sum of 4501L, by a check in favour of Lawley, and on the 18th of June a further sm of 2001. by a seoond check in favour of laWley. Theee two sums made up 6501, being the amount which, according to the plaintiff's cae, the plaintiff Wad paid LAWley for the horse Gemma di Vergy, purchased by him of IAwley on the 18th of June. Hargreaves Was examined, and stated that he had managed the horse for both Lawley and the plaintiff, and that after the sale in June, 1856, he had accounted to the plaintiff for its winnings. Mr. Slirrow, the solicitor for Lord Wen. lock, Mr. Lawley's father, proved that he received the check for 450L from the plaintiff, and, having got the cash, handed it over to fr. LaAwley, who about that time had become greatly involved by his betting transactions, and found it neoessary to leave the country. The plaintiff, Charles Coglan, said that he bad in 1850 sustained heavy losses on the turf, and had been utterly ruined, and that he was obliged to take the benefit of the Insolvent Act. When the plaintiff stated this fact he shed tears. In 1855 he had won 2,500L on tho Cesarewitch, and in 1856 he had won considerably by the Derby. On the 18th of June, 1856, he said he purchased this horse of Lawley for 6.501,, and received an order directed to the trainer, to deliver it up to him. From that
time he (the plaintiff) had received all the horse'3 winnings and paid all his stakes, and expenses or training, &c. This witness was cross-examined at great length to shake his credit. It appeared that he had begun life by being apprenticed to a merchant at Dublin, but he did not follow that or any other business than the turf, which he joined in 1835 In 1840 he won 10,0001 of a youngman named Stratford, at the Wellington Arms, Strathfieldsaye, at a game called " Blind hookey." He received bills for the amount and endorsed them to a person namned Hill, and got by tbe transction from 4,000L to 5000L in cash. Hil sued Stratford on the bils, but failed in the action and lost al the money. Coglan had paid away the money which Le had received to another person, and was thus prevented from refunding the money. However, the plaintiff said he had received such a " moral lesson" from the transaction that " he had become virtuous ever since." His debts w en he became insolvent in 1851, were 8,8111., but his assets were " nil." He said he did not pass the Court in conseaence of a technical objection, and hix petition was dismiad He did not pass the Court till 1855 He was then living at No. 10, Alexander-square, Brompton, but in the month of October in that yea? he went dovn to the steeplechase at Liverpool and Was there arrested. He petitioned the Court, but be could not tell what the amount of his d_bts was. It was suggested that they amounted to 20 000L, but the witness was unable to give any idea as to the amount. He stted that on the 12th of May, 18i6, lawley had accepted a bill for 640Z. for his (CoglSans) accommodation, which he (Coglan) got discounted by the defendant, and receired 600l.; but the bil l not honoured. Dawson, the trainer, stated that in June, 1836, he had been informed by Iawley that he had sold the horse to Coglan. and tbatfrom that time he debitedCoglanwiththekeep, c. HRepaid thbtin Jnne, 1856, thehorsewasworth701 or 800S hut itwasnowwort200 gnineas. A man named Hamii, a crossing swc!rw, 0ho was descnrbed as beins the Hon. Francis wleys whconfidential agent," was called to prove that the amonnt of one of the checks had been paid to Mr. Lawley. This, how. ever, was admitted, so that the evidence of the witness, who, with the assistance of a gold eyeglass, had carefully inSpected the check, became unnecessary
Mr. Serjeant PIGOrr, forthe defendant, commented in strong terms upon the impropriety of placing any credit in the evidence of such a character as Coglan. Be contended thlat the horse, at the time of the seizure, ws still the pro. perty of LAwley; and that the arrangement abont the pretended sale was a mere pretenc resorted to in order to pro. tect from Ls.wleya creditors a horse which i' was proved had nowv become a valuable property.
hfr. Justice WTLLES left it to the jury to say whether it wras proved to their satisfaction that the hnrso wvas Coglan's property Coglan did not appear before the jury in a very reputablemanner and the jusy might not havo been disposed to believe his evidence, if it had stood alone. But, as it was confirmed in some points by other witnesses, the ury must say whether the plaintiff's case was proved.

accompanied b a shriveled-up, wretched-looking old man, hobbling very raniely, and begged his interference on the mn's bealf.
Mr. Martin said.-I am exceedingly sorry. Sir, to tronble you again upon such matters, but I really feel it ix compulsory upon me to do so, as any other course of proceeding in relation to affairs connected with the Whitechapel Workhouse authorities and their desttuto poor is worse than useless. This poor old man whom I have brought with me was for many years known to most of the old residents of teparish as ave , hard-working and appxrently honest fellow, earning his bread bybix daily labour in vending fi.h and such other articles as he could afford 'to purchase. He failed in this at last. it ems, for about three months ago he was oblged to maske application to get admitted into the workhouse, and a petition was therefore drawn up and signed by myself and several respectable tradesmen of the neighbourhood to faciitate his object Although he had thhi petition, however, he bad nevertheless, it seems, to attend four or five times at the boardbeforehe could gain admission, but when he did so we, of cours, thonght he was at last permLUnently provided for, such as It was. Only about a month, however, dapsed, whenJi AaIoundto-ave been tbhted out, as he xays, and on Wednesday lat the poor felnw again presented himsel st my door, complaining of that fact, and beig entirely destitute, but it wa o inconvenient to me to attend sain before you, Sir, that I was obliged to take care of him at my own expense until I could do so.
Mir. HAmvm.-It mrust be extremely distressug to you. bfr. Kartin, no doubt, to sek againformy interrerenoe, and it is equallySoto ins that such cases should be so freqnently brought before me. (To the old mn4)-What is your name?
Applictnt-WlUaxm Williams, Sir. Mr. H Am.LT.-Howr old are you T Applicant.-About 76, Sir.
lar. HAsmrmr,-Where were you born?
Applicont.-In Whiteobapol parish, Sir. They offered me a ahilling a-week and a loaf for tbreo wveeks to go out of the hose, and T aid I could not do anything with that but thatI hand no obeti to takef a few sthtiings and try what I could do WithIt But the fact is that I don't want to leave the workhouse, as I bad much better die there than starve In the streets, I can't do but little, you see, Sir, as I am badlyruptured, and I have lived boneotly and don't want to do no wron- to anybody. They did offer me the 3 in a lump if I world go out but I couldn't mnake any profit on that and they then told mestoo tout. Ihave not a friend in the whole world but this gentleman.
Mr. Wartin.-Why, Sir, I believe tbat tbe very rhirt he had on wben he went into the workhbose is the very one he has got on now, and he tells me that he has had to pick oakcm from n o'clock til 4 o'clock without food.
Mr. Ilx -The athoritie r ink, oaghttoexercise their discretionary powers in cases of this kind, and knowing that a man of the years of this, and mranifestly unequal to any exertion, could not p y maintain himsl tbhy should have kept him in the house even though be ahonid have expresed a dedre to leave it himself I will send the warrant-officer of the distict with him to the workhouse, and require that he should be admitted at once.
"Thank you kindly, Sir; tbank you kindly," Paid the old man, bursting Into teats from nervoux exdtement, and Gee, the officer, was directed to take hin there
tr. IHxrtin-I wll mow, with your permission, mention another circumstance, Sir, that haslorg verymuch surprisod ine. Over the gate of the casual wards I find a notice has been posted Dp,to the effect as I recollect it, that " On and after the 2Sd of August, 1556 the casual ward will he
losed, and DO person admitted. " As that notice is still there, It has been in full force, I presume, ever sinco then. What its effect may have been I, of course, cannot smy, but In connerion witb it, as I think may possibly have been the case, I wish to obserre that on the 17th of lat Febrnary I had to attend as a juror upon three inquets held at the London Hogpital, and it ws then given in evidence that each of the wretched subjects of the inrJuest had died from exposure to the cold and exbaustion. One of the men vws named Clarke,-theother two were, I believe, unknown, and the fWc were ' that one was found in Mount-street sitting dead on a doorstep ; another was found in a square spacoeatthebackof the London Hospital, in adyingstate, and expired sbortly after his admission; and the third was discoverd in loeemary-lsne, and died almost instantly. The verdict returned in each ease was death from the causes I have named, and Ibeliere that no acount of those Inquests appeare in the papers, though a letter In relation o tbhe snuiect did appear in m7e Time from one of the snrgenns of the hospital, who Is distinguisbed for his kindnems you may reoellecttthat on a former occasion of my attending before you in thiucapacity you advised me to writoetothe PoorLaw Board on the subject of workhouse abuses, and I did so, but the result of my efforts would appear to be mimply that the board condemned my interferenoo-cer. tainly disinterested enough-and attributed tbo apparent want exhibited at the doors of the workhouse to the indiscriminate relief that I and otbers had been the means of affording. (Mr. Martin here exhibited an oTical letter of six foolseap pages, and asgned "Courtenay, vecrtay "a; econflrmative,)
Mr. HkmnuL-I am certainly surprised to bear ths. for I can bear testimony myself to your conduct having been upon every occasion of the kind that has como under my knowledge most charitable and humane. Tt, in fsct, appeared to me that some persons would have probably perished from want but for your timely aid.
Mr. Martin thanked the magistrato for his courtesy and retired, and Gee someftime after returned and intimated that the old man had been again admitted.
SouvmsRwAs.w-Jeaob Evans, the keeper of a low lodginghouse in Kent-strcett and Margaret Sheen, a yonng woman with whom he cohabited, were charged with being concerned nI breking into a butcber'sa sbop at 9, Kent-street, and stealing 13 stone of beef, Talue 21. 8e, the property of Charles ollacnd. -
Sergeant Hewlett, 29 M3, aidthiat he received informafion of the hurglaryr and in oonsequence of what hebhesrd he went to the prisoners house, a very low common lodginzhouse frequented by thives, and saw the woman. Hf
asked her where the cellar was, ashe wanted to search it for atolen property. She told him to find it out. ear their private parlour he discovered a trap which, on lifting up ed to large cellar, Containingoi mattresses, pieces of wood, Ac. e descended with Sergeant Sanders, 54 A, and at the end enteredajow archway. Having procured a light ho found the 13 atone of beef which had been tolen from the butcber's *hop, when both prioners weretaken into custody. The cellar was so singularly situated that a verson might cross the trap several times without findinR it out.
Mx. BuRciL4m -Then you think it is so contrived as to receive stolen property ?
Sergeant Hewlett replied that it was, and ho had no doubt it had boeen in use for that purpose many years The opening was in sight of the prisoners' apartment, and they maut bave seen any one go to it.
Charles Holland, a very poor man, stated that through
the kindness of some friends he had been enabled tD ope A small butcher's shop at No. 9, Kcnt- teet. On the preyo! eus day he purchased 13 stone of beef, for which heypeid 21. I. and he left it safe in his zhop at 11 o'clock at mght. shortly before 5 o'clock that morsung he was called up bj the polie, when he found thbt hs shop had been broken into and all the beet stolen. Witness identified the beef produced as his property.
Edwin Coleman, 53 Mt aid be assisted in apprehending the prioners, who deniod all knowlodge of tho bef and
Id it must have boen put in the cellar by some of the
~.BtuRcn A ho hadno doubt as to the use the prisoners put therr celLar to. It was leerl *a receptacle ef stolena goods, and they mvst hare known si about the beef. He souldremnd tem utilThurdaynext, to enable tho police to snac further inqnuiries. x
L UMIJET.-ThomM Rowe, a stoker to the Iron Steamboat Company, was placed at the bar before Mr. BlltDosl, charged with stealing two brass port light frames fromn the Lady of the IAke steamboat, the property of tbe company.;
Prom the statement of hlr. Cattarne, tbe company's secretary, and the testitmony ot Mr. John Evans, its chief engineer, it appeared that the compLny, in considerattion for their servants, employed all theos' whom thEy did not require during the winter moniths, rather than discharMe them, in their yard at Nine Elms, though thcre was not a great deal to do; and from this yard a variety of propert7 ha recently been missed. On the evening before the pi;. soner was oserved in a barge alongkide the premises, and about to get away by the shoro, instead of lcaving by the
roper ateway entrance, half an bour before his proper time. o was called to to oome bhck to the premises, and ultimately did so, when the brass frames wero found upon him, and he h d stripped them from the porthole of the
Sad of the Lxle o teamLt.
The prisoner pleaded "guilty" to the charge, and tho magistrate, observing tht the ease was a very bad one, sentenced him to dsi months' hard labour at the Wands. worth House of Correction.

The New American Cabinet.-Our special
THE NEW A?rERICAiv CAms ry.-Our special despatch, received last night from Lancater, confirms substantially the Cabinet rumours of tho last day or two from Washington and elsewhere concerning tho more prominpnt individuals selected for the Cabinet *f Mr. Buchanan. First it appears that after a careful reconsideration of the whole gronnd Mr. Buchanan has thought it safest and soundest to fall back upon General Cans for the State Department. Thia is, perhaps, a sort of compromise as between the two Southern wingsof the party-Cobb, Union and Conservative, and Walker, Fibuster anad Scessionist If, however, the Southern fireaters would not have Mr. Cobb As Premier they will have been rightly served in the appointnient of General Cass. We dare say, too, that if Jererson Davis and his peculiarset in the South, and John Van Buren and others in the North can throw up their hats to General Cmas as Premier, the country can consent to give bim a fair trial. As the father of squatter sovereignty, at aU events, and considering his declarations in the Senate against the ' bogus" laWs of Kansas, we ma& regard the appomtment of General Cas as a sxttlcr to tho border ruffau plicy of poor Pierce. Mr. Cobb is eminently quanified for tbeduties of the Trcasury Department, and if the now Tariff Bill, which has Iust passed the House, shall become law, a vigorous and industrious man like Mr. Cobb will be the sort of officer required to put the working machinery of guch an Act into efficient and harmonious practical operation. The other gcntlemen deocided upon for Cabinet honours, according to our Lxncaster despatch, are cx-Governor Aaron Vail Brown, of Tenessoe; ex-Governor Floyd, of Virginia; and Hon. Jacob Thompson, of UlissisDppi; but their respectivo places remRin yet to be a,tsigned tot em. J. Glancy Jones is evidently disposed of, as doing very well where he is in the House of Representatives. We fear nothing further of Mr. B htof Indiana, though
he may yet oome in at the eloverth hour. General rumour assigns tho post of Attorney-General to Mr. Toucoy, of Connecticut, tbough we apprehend the inclinations of Mr. Buchanan are still in favour of Mr. Clifford. of Maino. It is enough for one day that Gcencral Cass is to be the new Premier and Mr. Cobb the Secrctary of the Treasury Squatter sovereignty thus far is boldly in the ascendancy. Another day or two will probably furnish us the checks and balances of the remaining members of Mr. Buchanan's Ministry, and may perhaps materially nodify any existing concluslons in the way of)a general averago of tho calibre character, and policy of the nOW Administration. We cannot as yet assume that a war with England is " inevitable" from tbo reported appointment of General Cass.-Z'ca Yoru

XfILITARY AND NAJVAL INTELLIGENCE.
On S-iurday Mjor-Genral Breton, the Lieutenant4 tovernor of Portsmouth garrison and Commanding-in. thief the South-West District, received orders to, prepare the three regiments of the line now on duty there for embarcation for China at a moment's notice. Mhese troops are the 23d Royal Welsh Fusileers, the 'd (or "Prince of Wales's Volunteers"), and the 90th light Infantry (" Perth8hire Volunteers"). A fourth regi~ment is also ordered for embarcation for the same destination, but its number we have not heard. The 93d High. landers, however, we believe, is the regiment. These corps will be sent out in their " full strength"-about 1,067 eacb, Dt all ranks (not including officers). Thus, about 4,500 troops will embark at Portsmouth in a few days for the -eat of war in the Celestial Empire. The steamers commiasoned or ordered to be employed in carrying out these and the other forces (1,000 marines) to their destination are Jler Majesty's ships,-

Transit, 4 guns, 600-horse power, 190 crew, Commander Chambers, at Portsmouth.
Assistance, 400-horse power, at Portsmouth;
Adventure, 400-horse power, at Portsmouth (the comple-ments of these two ships have not been defined yet).
Sidon, 22 gmus, 560-horse power, 1,328 tons, 300 crew, at Tortsmouth.
Fulrious, 16 guns, 400-horse power, 1,286 tons, 223 crew, at Portsmouth.
The four last-named are not commissioned, but are expected to be so for this service. If these vessels bear the same complements as they did on their last service they -wil add a reinforcement in seamen and marines of upwards ,of 2,200.
The Himalaya will go round from Plymouth to Portsmnouth to embark her troops there. It is thought she wil take at least two regiments.

A VL ur" LmPosTo B.-At the Leeds borough sessions on Saturday, before MIr. Robert Hall, Deputy Recorder, Mary Eliza Tremaine, alias Matilda Terewist, alias B:eaway, alias Field, alias Hook, alias Pease, d&, was charged with stealing 11. 10s., a pair of sCissors, a purse, and a handkerchief, the property of John Clough, publican, Feorr-hill, Durham. She firstpleaded " Guilty," ut afterwar s withdrew the plea. Her real name is Grace [Berwick, and she is respectably connected. She was born in London, and is apparently between 30 and 40 years of age, though she was entered in the calendar as 25. She has a pleasing voice and somewhat earnest manner, combined with an apparent diffidence and hesitancy calen. lated to excite sympathy. Her career has been one continued series of deceptions, and during the last 18 or 20 pears she has appeared in various parts of England and 1reland, and within more recent years has been imprisoned at Liverpool, Derby, Leeds, Northallerton, and Durham. Her mode of action is adapted to the circumstances of the times, but generally she has represented berself as the daughter or ward of sonme well-known person, escaping from persecution, and suffering "for conscience' sake" and her appeals bave for a time, in most cases, proved successful. With reference to the charge for Mhich she took her trial on Saturday it appears that early in Deember last she, accompanied by a dog, went to the
rosecutor'% stating that she had escaped froni a convent in rance, and was endeavouring to elude the detection of her lather, whlo had offered c reward for her apprehension.

Warren, then in the Bosphorus to proceed to the Pineus, embark the 91st Regimentk and convey it to Corfu, after which the ships are to proceed to England, calling at Malta on their way.
Cadiz papers to the 28th ult. had been received at Gibraltar. The Spanish line-of-battle ship Reina Isabel II., Captain Brigadier Don Antonio de Arevalo, arrived at Cadiz on the 27th from Mahon, in tow of the steamer Colon, of 6 guns, Captain Don Ignacio de Arias The Contribuyente says that " the expedition which the Spanish Government is about to despatch to Cuba to vindicate its honour and place in safety the interests compromised in Mexico will be compoeee of from 20 to 30 vessels, storeships and transports included, and from 8,000 to 10,000 picked troops. They are to be commanded by a General who has already distin. guished himself by his gallantry abroad."
Advices from Gibraltar extend to the 3d inst, The recently erected public baths and washhouses were opened by the Governor, Sir James Ferguson, on the 24th ult., in the presence of the civil and military authorities. A handsome collation was served to a distinguished party in a marquee, and the band of the 92d Highlanders contributed to the festivities. Lieutenant Leith, of the 92d Highlanders, died on the 21st nlt., at his quarters, and was buried in the cemetery atthe North Front with military honours Exchanges on the 28th were quoted as follows .-London, 90 days' date, 51; Paris, do., f. 35c.; Marseilles, do., 5f. 34c.; Genoa, do., 5f. 38c.; Madrid, eight days' sight, I dis. ; Cadiz, do., & dis.; Malaga, do., i dis.; Seville, do., 2 dis.; Alicante, do., J dis.; Valencia, do., i dis.; Barcelona, do., dis.

One of the crew was unfortunately drowned, and the remainder (six in number) were providentiaUy saved by the exertions of the Carbineers on that station. The vessel went to Pieces.
The Dutch bark lenriette Geertruida, Captain de Boer, from Alexandria, laden -with wheat, went ashore on the night of the 22d, off the Eastern Beach at Gibraltar, but was got off again, after several days' unceasing efforts, and was anchored in the Bay.
The screw steamer Demetrius, Captain Young, from IAverpool for Beyrout, ut back to Gibraltar on the 19th ult., having been in collision with a bark belonging to Malta.

The Demetrius lost bulwarks, stanchions, cutwater, &c., besides having some of her bowphtes carried away. The Superintendent of Her MIajesty's dockyard having granted every facility for the purpose, the necessary repairs were speedily effected, and she resumed her voyage to fhe eastward On the imght of
The New Most Honourable Order Of The
TIE NEW MosT HONOURABLE ORDER OF TE BAILm-There is a sort of logical consistency in the conduct of the Government to the Crimean Commissioners. As all the principal actors in the Tragedy of Errors have been covered with distinctions and promoted, rewards of the same kind could not be suitably bestowed in requital of the very opposite work of restoring an army to efficiency. Lord Pal. merston asserts that this is not indeed a military service, and certainly, after having consented to reward as military service the misdoings at Balaldava, by which so many gallant lives were lost and so much grievous suffering unnecessarily caused, he was not in a position to confer on those who saved the same honours as had been showered on those who destroyed Her Majesty's men and cattle in the Crimea. The services in the field which were specially selected for the highest rewards were the services which left men and horses perishing of cold and hunger, with abundant supplies close at hand. We see soldiers decorated for killing so many of the enemy with the sword or bayonet, but what is that exploit compared to kIling 100 times as many of our own countrymen by neglect? What Damas, the younger, falsely says of the English people has too much truth in it as applied to their Government -" C'est un peuple gen6reux qui recompense mieux qu' aucune autre les mauvaises actions. Toute sa politique est la dedans." How it can be maintained that saving an army is not a military service is to us utterly incomprehensible, except on the ground we have intimated, that the work of ruining one has
en rewarded as military service? Is there, then, any inconsistency in the neglect of Sir John M'.Neill and Colonel Tulloch, when all the persons whose incapacity they bron4ht to light are seen advanced to high stations of authority and blazing with decorations? And, in a way, Government has been thoroughly consistent. It has been anxious to eagerness that no one who has fallen short in the execution of any important duty should escape marks of its approbation. So when Admiral Sir C. Napier returned from his exploitless campaign to beard and insult the Board of Admiralty the Queen was of course advised to offer him the Grand Cross of the Bath as a testimony of Her Majesty's appreciation of the nothing he had done abroad and the bad exampl he had set to the profession at home. For once Sir Charles Napier was discreet. Ho said, "No, no; old birds are not to be caught with chaff. I ahali not be such a fool as to confess that I have dons so ill as to deserve the sort of distinction bestowed on the Crimean inca-
hables." He wisely refused the bait. Contending that
deserved praise, not blame, he declined to be placed in the same class with the Cardigans, Wetheralls, Aireys, &c.; and he did well in this respect, if in nothing else. To return now to the commissioners, whose case is so diametricaUy different. When the crane in the fable has rendered the service of plucking the bone out of the wolf's throat, the wolf wonders at his impudence in looking for reward, asking, " Is it not enough that you get your head safely out of my jaws?" Now a colonel who has exposed incapacity in high places in the army and in the persons of men of aristocratic positions or powerful connexions is in much the same predicament, as regards the Horse Guards, as the crane who has removed an obstruction in the wolf's throat, and must be thankful for not having his head snapped off in requital of his service. The utmost grace of the Horse Guards to such an officer is to spare him. Sir John M'Neill is in a different position, being a civilian, and there was noway of marking the sense of what he had done more strongly than by cold neglect. The public, however, would not have it so, for the public has some gratitude for services, and a cry rose through aU the length and breadth of the land for some recognition of the services of Sir J. I'Neill and Colonel Tulloch. Rather late in the day Lord Palmerston gave them some fair words ; later still, Lord Panmure elaborated the illustration of the virtus laudatur et aget. More was demanded by the publc than this tardy hp-homage. Sorely did it puzzle clever Lord Palmerston to devise appropriate reward for the Crimean Commissioner3, and long was he conning the knotty proverb. At last the brilliant thought occurred to give them each a tip of 1,000 The proverb says, bis dat qui cito dat, he gives double who gives promptly. If this be true, the 1,0001. offered after such long hesitation to Sir J. l'Neill and Colonel Tulloch must be considered half-price. Ovid says of an exquisite piece of art that the workmanshi
surpassed the material, rich as it was, and Lod Panmtres manner of offering the 1,0001. certainly transcends the natural fraco of that lump of money. He calls it a ' tender, ' a cood legal word, expressive of the satisfaction of all demands, and, though intiitating, plainly enougb, that it is the money value of the services, not a penny less, he adds that over and above it marks Her 3Majesty's recognition of the Comnsissioners' zeal arqd ability. But how, in the namo of wonder, does it mark any such thing? Tell a man that you pay him what is due to him, and wel and good, but do not attempt to make him believe that there is more than the money in the transaction. As well might Lord Panmure pay a cabman his 6d., and tell him it is not only his fare, but a recognition of his dexterity in not upsetting him, and driving him safely home.-Examiner.
ANTIQuARIAN Discovzmty.-On the farm of Colleonard, in the neighbourhood of Banff, some men, whilo engaged in trenching, found an urn about 11 inches in height, which has round the neck the peculiar herring-bono cinament common on urns of the British period.

The English In China.
TEH EHGL1SH IN HINL.
TO TEE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Having in the course of seven yeas residence in Hlongkong acquired some knowledge of the Chinese, their eharscter, and their ideas with regard to foreigners gene. rally, I Tenture to offer a few remarks on the late vote of the House of Commons on Mr. Cobden's motion and its probable results.
The effect of our futile and ineffectual proceedings in 1847 aud in 1849 on the question of our treaty right to enter the city of Cantonrt was simply to give the Chinese the idea that we were a vapouring, blustering nation, whose bark wa3 worse than its bite, and whothreatened what we were afraid to carry out when we found that the Cantonese were deter mined to reaist the enforcement of our rights. This is not an inference of my own, but what I have been told by Chinese of all classes (with whom, in the course of my profersional experience, I have had a pretty numerous acquaintance). The idea that wo were to be insultd with impunity has in consequence gained daily strength, and has become fixed in the minds of the Cantonese, who have, as isael; known, been continually exposing British subjects to petty annoyances and insults. We have now initiated whea I hope and trust will eventuate in a determined proof o: the erroneousnature of their conclusions, and, if it is carried out uncompromisingly and with rigour, It will be a salutary lesson to them, and have the ultimate effect of causing them to pause from a dread of the consequences before again venturing to come into collision with us. If, however, any mistaken ideas should lead to that temporizing and weak tiling with a great subject which characterid our two former efforts, the consequences will be raeos disastrous both as to our commercial interests with China nd-wha. is still more important-to the safety and welfare of our countrymen there. It may be said, and I believe was said by Mr. Cobden, that all the harm th cat n be done has been done, and that, as there are now no foreigners at Canton, there can be no more lives in jeopardy. But, Sir, the peculiar position of Hongkong has never, I believe, been thoroughly understood in England. It is a mere barrenrock, quitedestitute of any internal regources, and producing literally nothing, depending entiri on the mainland of Chinaevenfor its daily supplyof meat,vegetables, and other necessaries of existence; and, altboughthe Chinese shopkeepers and tradesmen on the island are well-disposed towards foreigners, yet it must be remembered that with very few, if any, exceptions, all their families are living on the mainland, and, in many instances, far in the interior
and that they are thus completely in the hands of the man: darins, who can, by a motion of their fingers, deprive Hong. kong (now filed with the foreign community of Canton) literally of the means of subsistence; and it will be very extraordinary if we do not soon hear that both our forces and the civil residents are literally in a state of blockade, for although the mandarins may be " lambs" in the eyes of Lord Derby and Mr. Cobden, yet they are, with their whole nation, a most truculent, treacherous, and bloodthirsty race, whose innate diplomacy and cunning will not allow them to overlook so obvious a method of crippling, and, to a certain extent, paralyzLg our operations. It is notorious that there is still a price on the heads of those compradores who supplied our men-of-war with provisions during the last war, and that they dare not leave Hongkong. This is no fancied evil, but a very proximate one, as there is not A single sheep or head of cattle on the island, save afewworklag bulloeks,and the evil has been felt already, as on one occasion, owing to some discontent amoDg the market people of a purely local nature, we were obliged to provision ourselves for some days in advance, and for two days food was not procurable. You may fancy, then, to how much greater an extent the evil will spread under the able hands of Yeh's lambs. The atrocities practised on each other at Amoy when attacked by rebels in 1854 will show what we have to expect at their hands, and what will be the consequence if the hands of Government are to be fettered by the platitudes which have found utterance within the last fortnight. Unless, therefore, we strike such a blow as will infusa dread and terror into their minds therO will be butlittle security for either life or prope rty in China under any patched-up treaty, made in accordance with the views of the highly respectable firm of Cobden, Russell, Gladstone. and Co.
As to the loroha question a great point was made, if I recollect rightly, on the idea that the Chinese authorities had no knowledge of our practice of granting sailng letters to colonial craft (for they are essentially colonbal, and not British craft). Now, it Is notorious that one of the most lucrative sources of employment for these craft, aud in many instances the principal inducement for obtaining the sailing letter, is the large sums paid, not alone by Chinese merchants, but by Chinese mandarins themselves, for the services of these craft in convoying trading and fishing junks along the coast,
large fleets of such craft often being afraid to venture out of harbour until the services of a vessel possessing this much decried colonial saiiing-letter can be obtained to protect them from piratical attacks These vessels rarely carry more than one, European as master, but are generally heavily armed, and could no more be mistaken for Chinese craft than could a Deal lugger. In addition to this, however, every colonial craft has her name and port painted on the stern, and as the Chinese always speak of a lorcha as a " foreign vessel" it seems rather begging the question to suppose that the mandarin boat boarded the Arrow under the idea that she was a Chinese vessel, even if the flag was not flying. It wil be remembered that all the informnatilo
to glibly given by Yeb about the antecedents of the vessel were obtained by examination of the men taken from on board her. An to the expiry of the 3ailing-letter the point is hardly worth mentioning were it not to put a case actually once happening under my own knowledge. A coasting schooner carxying the British flg under a sailing-letter did not return to Hong_ kong until more than two months after the expiry of the sailing-letter, and had been engaged in coasting all the time, lying for some time also at one of the five consular ports, and bringing specie on board to the extent of upwards of $50,000. Do the opponents of Lord Wensleydalces aw mean to say that this vessel was not entitled to the protection of the British fla,, or that the consul at the port she was lyizng at could not or should not protect her from Chinese interference? And what national character or name had she in the meantime ? I fancy, if any of them had committed a crime on board the Arrow, even after the expiry of the sailing-letter, he would have stood but a poor chance if he had no better defence than that the Supreme Court of Hongk-ong had no jurisdiction, because the offence bad been committed within China, on board a vessel not being a British one.
Although not an admirer of Sir J. Bowring, still I think it but fair to state that his whole policy from his consulship upwards has been, instead of " arrogant " or " menacing " towards the Chinese, exactly the reverse; the prindpal cause of complaint against him on the part of the mercantile community having been that he has always been more tender of the interests of the Chinese than those of his own countrymen, as witness theteaduties of Shanghai, the unpopular appointment of Imspectori Of Customs for the Chinese, &C. As an instance, moreover, of the careful avoidance on his part of any possible cause of offence to the Chinese on the ground of international polity, I may mention that on my applying once for the process of the Consular Court of Canton to compel a British subject to refund passage-money to some 600 Chinese emigrants, SirJohn (then Dr.) Bowring refused to grant the aid of the Consular Court on the ground that, as emigration was forbidden to Chinamen by their own laws, he could not enter upon a question which might involve us in unpleasantness with the Chinese authorities, as supporting their subjects in infraction of their laws. I do not admire Sir J. Bowring (although undoubtedly a man of great and versatile talents), and have been opposed to most of his measures in his present office; but I fancy be will be rather astonished to fnd himself accused of " arrogance" towards the Chinese authorities when he has been most forward in carrying out that conciliatory policy and tone which have in the opinion of most persons tended so largely to foster that spirit of aggression on the part of the Chinese which had its climax in the affair of the Arrow.
Much has been said in depreciation of Mr. Consul Parkes, who is a most valuable publc servant, and who, in addition to an intimate acquaintance with the languge and customs of China, is gifted with a strong fund of common sense, and possesses tact and urbanity of demeanour that in an eminent degree fit him for the arduous and important post he so efficiently flls.
I have been led into greater length than I contemplated but, having a personal interest in the ultimate settlement of this matter, prosiness may perhaps be excused in

The Opium Trade With China.
rHE OPIUr TRtDE WrrZH CHINA.
TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES.
8ir,-Ou rading the debates upon the affair at Canton rhich hve occupied the House of Commons for the last few nights I (in common with mnny otbers who have resided in China) Bave been both edified and amused by the peculiar views entertained by many of the hon. members uponthesubject, by their confident asnumptlbn of facts that are untrue, and by their false deductions from those that are correct. Anong other matters quite foreign to the question, the iniquity of the opium trade has been strongly insisted on, and stated and re-sateid with every variety of fanciful embellishments and perversion of truth.
The iast speaker referring to this point, Mr. Kinnsird, says that " hundreds of thousands of lives were lost in consequence of the opium trade." I should be glad to ask him upoa what data he founds his statement, whether he is aware what quantity of opium is annually imported into China, what qntity a Chinese would smoke when taking It in moderation or to excese; in short, whether he knows anything at all about the matter upon which he so authoritatively speaks.
As I have been some yeas in China, and have but lately returned, I could give him from personal knowledge some detIls of the trade, but, as it might be supposed that mine was an cx partc statement, I prefer chiefly to quote from "RemarksupontheOpiumde,;writtenbytheweI-known Chinese scholar and missionary the late Dr. Medhurst, and published in the Ntora China Hcrald in October, 1855 This paper was written in condemnation of the trade, and in the endeavour to raise a feelingagainst it in England, and it may therefore well be supposed that nothing that could aggravate the evil was omnitted; but from it I think I can show that the declarations we so often hear sbout the number of victims to the drug, and the illegality and violence of those who sell it, are pure ficdion.
I quote from Dr- Medhurst: -
"As to the probable number of smokerb we have only xpproximate calculations. Innes, writing on the subject in December, 1836, supposed that a tael, or an ounce, a-dxy is the proper allowance for a confirmed opium smoker. A writer in the Rcporitory for October. 1837, gives only three candareens, or 17, grains, a-day fer a moderate smoker. Both estimates seem to be in error, the one being excessive and the other defective. On inquiry of the Chinese at Shanghai in the present day the invariable answer is a maue or a dram, a-day for moderate smokers, adding that there are few who confine themselves to this amount, the most of them consuming two, three, and five mace a-day, in order to keep up the stimulus once excited by a single mace. An objection may be brought by some that such a quantity of the narcotic would kill them at once, and therefore I they could not take it; to which it will be sufficient to I reply that it does not. A medical mun who has had much
to do with opium-smokers, and is well acquainted with the quantity e consumes, and the effects produoed upon hi
stesm says thatif a man uses only a dram a-day it does his generlhealthlittleinjury-confuedinveterate, pale-skinned smokers use two, three, four, and even six and eight mace a-day. Persons only acquainted with the effects of ophim in Europe would still stand aghast at the statement that a Chinaman will consume half an ounce a-day without killing him. But it mnust be remembered that the Chinese only smoke it-they do not swallow it, One mace mixed up with ardent spirits and taken into the stomach would be sufficient to poison a man at once, and many do poison themselves in this a. But passing, as it does, by means of the pipe through the lungs, its poisonous qualities are greatly diminished. The smoking extract above spoken of (ze., opium boiled and prepared for the use of the smoker) does not amount to one half of the bulk of the opium. From a careful experiment made it appears that one catty, or 16 taels, yield of extract 7 taels, 8 mace, 8 candareens, being a reduction of 51 per cent. A chest of Patna, therefore, weighing 1401b, gives cnly 701b. of extract. This is a very extravagant way of ui.lng the opium, but it is the method the Chinese have adopted, and its awful cheapness enables them to throw away more than half the narcotic power of the drug, and to use the other in such a way that the result upon the system are only one-tenth of what it would be if taken inwardly, as the people in Turkey, and unhappily some in Europe, do. Assunmin the proportion of a mace a-day as the average amount o daily consumption of each person to be correct, we can easily arrive at the number of smokers througbout the empire. Proceeding upon the statement of the China Mail that 67,000 chests were delivered in China last year, and that each chest contains 70 catties of smokeable extract, allowing to each smoker one mace a-day we bave little more than 2,000,000 of smokers for the vhole empire."
Therefore, Sir, we have upon this authority that if all the opium imported into China be used there (which it Is not, a considerable quantity being sent to Cochin), and if each man used so little that it does his general health little injury, there can be only 2000,000 of smokers in the empire, or two-thirds of 1 per cent. in the population. But we are also told that confirmed smokers use two, three our, andeven six and eight mace a-day.
If we assumed the average only of four, the number of smokers is reduced to 500,000, or 1-6th of 1 per centIt is admitted, too, thereby that people can smoke opium In moderation withoutsuffering from it,-a fact which seems to be quite lost sight of in England. How many actually do smoke to excess it is impossible to say, but certainly few in comparison with the number who use it; and, as above stated, there is not sufficient imported to make even the use general among the people. Everyone who has mixed with the Chinese must have known some habitual smokers, but have they ever known one who died from its effects? I can affirm I never did. To state positively that so many lives are sacrificed annually by opium is as absurd as to take the quantity of ardent spirits imported into and manufactured in Great Britain, to calculate how many people it would sufflee to kill if intentionally used in that way, and then to say it causes that number of deaths. It is idle to suppose that more would acquire the habit of smoking (not agreeable at first) if it were certain destruction to health and life. Like all stimulants, it may be used or abused, and come in the same category as they do. What does Dr. Medhurst say upon this point in another part of his " Remarks," when urging that the British Parliament should interfere to compel the East India Company to put an end to the growth of opium:-
" But let the British neople have a care when they are about the removal of abuses abroad that they with equal ardour seek to correct abuses at home. It would be the height of inconsistency to cry out against the East India Company for deriving a revenue from the tax on opium, when the Home Government derives a revenue from the tax on ardent spirits. The two articles are mischievous, not perhaps in a similar way nor to an equal degree, but they are both mischievous, and the same argaments which would lead to the aboltion of one would bear equaUy on the abolition of the other."
Dr. Medhurst evidently looks at ardent spirits and opium in much the same light.
The charge so often brought against the opium trade, that the Chinese cannot afford to buy our manufactured goods, because theyspend so much in the purchase of the drug, is, I think, sufficiently answered by the above statements, showing that the consumers of opium are only units among the thousands in the empire.
We now come to the question of its being a contraband trade, That it is so by tho laws of China no one can deny, but that it is really so in practice is contrary to fact. In China very many obsolete laws exist, which are neither observed by the people nor enforced by the Government, and are, in fact, dropped by mutual consent, and those against the trade in and use of opinm are thus dealt with. As all residents in China weU know, opium is carried openly about the streets, and public opium shops are in every city, and the opium dealers are weU known merchants, with whom the China authorities never attempt to interfere. In sending opium through the country taxes are levied on it by the mandarins, althovgh in consequence of previous edicts against it the Emperor cannot receive a regular import
1 the Govermment desired to put an end to the use of opium they would notpermit it to be cultivated largely in the country itelf, At present some 35,000 peculs are ted toberaisedannuaUy, vhich is equal to one-half of the quantity imported from abroad Der. Medhurst says
" Some contend that a large quantity of opium is grown in China. Mr. Fortune saw the poppy growing for the purpose of obtaining the inspissated jame. Neither he, howvever, nor any other man can tellbow much actually is grown. Snpposing it even to be one-half of the amount importedit would then raise the number of smokers to somewhere about 3,000,000."
To show that no fine is resorted to in the carrying on the sale of opium,vwhich hassoften been asserted, I quote again from Dr. Medburst, who, in complaning of the exaggerations of some of his brethren. savs:-
"The American missionary whose late speech we have before adverted to is reputed to have said ' this traffic is staining the British name in China with the greatest disgrace, as some of the subjects of Great Britain continue to carry on an armed contraband trade in a destructive poison, enriching themselves by merchandise wvhich impoverishes the poor Infatuated and besotted Chinese.' Now that misionary knows or ought to have known, that American citisens are fully as much implicated in this affair in China as the subjects of Great Britain."
The speaker ought lso to have known
"That the arming of the vessels enae nteoptiumtr afi ic is sunmply forg th eir own sprolteecntGion, an dt al little enough to defend themselve agis the raaiu wes cou.ntry pilraites who°hav dei of l tehear inese this coat
oiilumvessels are armed to resist the revenue officers of Cbiina, than wvhih no idea could be more erroneous"
This, then, appears to be the state of the case :-The use of foreign opium among the Chinese is ixmited to compae tivelya few, and its effes vary according to them=ode

The Peace With Persia.
rHE PEACZ WrTH PESrSA.
TO THE EDrrOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Your Paris correspondent, in writing of the gentlemen ent by Government to assigt our amb- - dor in his negotiations with Ferulc Elan, confined himself to the nention of their names and titles. I beg to send you a
light sketch of their Oriontal antecedents, as the public may be interested in knowing something more of these wise men of the East. throLgh whose valuable co-operation Lord Cowley has been enabled to bring those negotiations to such a satihfactory conclusion.
Colonel Oseley, who maybo said tobelongto an Oriental family-one of h s brothers, Sir William, being highly disaingmthed for his attainments in Eastern lterature, and another, 8ir Gore, having formerly gone as am basdor to Persia-is the Oriental professor xt EIxileybuty College.
Lientenant-OolonelOtter, HIer Majesty's 61stlegiinent, is vrell knowrn In India as a skilful anda ccomplished linguist, and held the appzointment of Persian interpreter to twro successive Comyn-ders-in-Chief-Lord Gough andSir William Gomm.
Mfr. Iledhoue, rho hxs papsed most of his life in Turkey, u the author of dictionaries and other elementary works in the langunee of that country.
And lastly, Captain Lynch, of the Indian navy, has had much personal experience in Persia and Turkish Arabia, and was aeociated writh Colonel Chemeny in the Euphrates expedition.

Children's Balloons.
CHILDRBES BALLOONS.
TO TEIE EDIIOR OF THE TImES.
Sir,-On arriving in town the other day I was amused by obeerving the quantity of balloons now being hawked about the streets for the amusement of children. I at once cautioned some friends that accidents will happen if these toys are brought into contact with flame; for an admixture of hydrogen (with which the balloons are inflated) and atmospheric air-which Is almost sure to gain admittanceis an explosive ga. My friends have since had demonstration of the fact. A blloon was brought near to the fire, in order to quicken its disposition to ascend to the ceiling the explosion took p lace, but in this case there was hap ify no further mischief than the destruction of one pane of windowglss and a room-full of soot, which rattled dowrn the ehimney.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-In reply to many inquiries relative to the detention of the War Spirit the Australian mail psaket of the 5th inst., until this afternoon, we beg leave to state thatCaptain Schomberg denied us a passenger clearance on the 5th, alleging a5 his reason that her draught of water was too great. As the ship registers 1,224 tons new and uprards of 1,400 old messrement, with 2217 depth of hold, and was only drawing 17-9 on an even keel, we differed from him In opinion, and, claiming our right of ap under the 11th section of the Act, wo telegraphod tofhEmigration Commissioners, who moet promptly sent down Captain Loan to act for them. This gentleman, in company with Mr. Pope, surveyor for L1oyd'N, went on board the War Spirit this morning, and their decision was, that tho ship was in perfect trim and might proceed to sea at once.
