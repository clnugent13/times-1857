THE EDINBURGH LIFE ASSURAiCECOldTPANY.-The Fourth Septennial Investigation and Division of Profits, as at 31st August, 1859, of the Edinburgh Life Assurance Conpany, having been completed, and submitted to the Annual General Court of 9th December Iast. and ratified and approved of by the Extra. ordinary General Court of 5th Janury, I0S57. the following examples ot bonus additions on a few of the actual existing >semuances (oot mere assumed cases and the total sums now payable ustler its oldest poli. cies, will best iluistrate the results; to all dirt-class lives of similar ages and endurance of policy-

Thus, at aU ages from 19 to 60. on the earliest poUdes, the accumulated bonuses now range from upwarde of £48 per cent. to upwards of £140 per cent. of the sums originally Insured; and in one instance to upwards of £42 per cent., or nearly two and one-balf times more than the sum assure'l.
To later entrants the resulte are, in proportion, equally Satisfactory; the bonus now declared on all participating policies of the last seTen year' endursmce averaging upsnwatis of one and one-half per cent. per annum of the sums assuread and the gradually-advancing rate ot bonus, as exhibited under each succeeding declaration, affords the fairest prospect to all present and future insurers that tlese results will be maintained until they also shall derive equally high benefits, when they become the oldest existing polizies of the Company.
The rerent value of any bonus may be received in cash; or it may eapp edin reduction of premium. A remarkable instance of the working of the las-named plan id afforded in the case of a poUcy taken out in 1S41 on the life of a prson 63 years of agein which the premnium is now reduced from £155 6a. to £13 M. 3d
An intermediate bonus. between one investigation and another, Uf(A the advantages that uay 6O supposed to acosue from annual
Liberal resolutions connected with the conditions of the policies of tbis office make them in every respect a souud egotiable document, and in all insuramues for family provisions, or otberwise, to protect the Interest of representatives, it may confilently be maintained that in no other life institution can higher benefits be derived by all Iirst-cdags lives.
Copies of the reports by Mr. James BrowS accountant, on the prin. ciples of thebompmu'splan of divison, and also the printed proceedinga in connexion with t e present declaration, may be had on appUcaion at the offies in Edinburgh and London, and agencies throughgent the kingdom.

BUTESHIRE.
ROTHESAY, Fme 12.
This day was appointed by the Sheriff of the count of ute for the return of a member to fin the seat vacan by the resignation of the Hon. Stuart Wortley, consequent upon his acceptanoe of the offlco of Solicito., eneraL Mr Wortley was again a candidate, and, as there was no opposition the proceedings excited very little interest. Very few ectors were present belonging to Bute
Sheriff Hunter having read the writ, &c,
Dr. GiESOA, the late Provost of Rothesay, moved that Mr. Wortley be again returned to Parliament as the representative of the joint counties of Bute and Arran.
The nomination was seconded by Mr. Jonix M'DouoMLT, Kerrytorhie, and, there being no other candidate, the Sheriff declared Mr. Wortley duly elected,
The Hon. S. WOPTLEY then addressed the electors. He thanked them for again placing him in the proud position of their representative, and, while he expressed himself deeply grateful to the friends who had sapported him, he thanked those who might not agree with him for their forbearance. When he last appeared before them he stood in an independent position, hut, Her Majesty having been Sleased to offer him a distinguished place under the
rown, he had accepted the post. The question arosewhether or not his constituents would approve the step ? They had done so. The hon. gentleman then referred to the late war. He had gupported that war, and he believed it was the universal opinion of the people of Great Britain that the war was of such a just and necessary character that Britain could not stand by without taking part in it. He referred to the disadvantageous position of the army after a 40 years' peace, and said that, notwithstanding, British soldiers had successfuly encountered the most powerful military nation in Europe. He had given the war his best support, and when in 1855 all eyes were turned to Lord Palmerston, he (Mr. Wortloy) was one of those who considered that his Lordship was the man for the crsis. When some of his political friends endeavoured to obtain a premature and unsatisfactory peace, he (Mr. Wortley) had separated from them. He had given Lord Palmerston his support throughout the war. Referring to taxation, he said he looked forward to relief from the present excess.ve burden. He next referred to the Maynooth question, and said that if a motion for the abolition of the grant were again presented to Parliament, ho would give it his support.

Swindling Extraordinary In Paris.-A strange
SwzNDLUNG EsTRAoRDInNAY IN PRuis.-Astrange case of swindling was yesterday tried by default before the Tribunal of Correctional Police. The accused was a man named Gudlin, who, after being sergeant in a regiment of cuiransiers, became a huilsser, or usher at the Mimistry of Foreign Affairs, in which capacity he received 1,800f. a- year as salary, and 500f. a-year as indemnity for expenses;
e also occasionally received valuable presents, and after the Peace Congress he got as much as 1,5h0f. from the plenipotentiaries. Comglaints having been made of the man's dishonesty, he was discharged from his situation, and shortly after left Paris, and has not since been heard of of. His age was represented to be 39, and hewas described as ahandsome man,with manners and bearing above his station. A jeweller of the Rue duTemple,namedAubery-Fromental, stated to the Court that some time ago he received a letter signed " Gudfin, crploy6 at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs," addressed *' AL Aubry," in which, after stating that " an intimate friend, Count de Sircourt," had given his address, the writer spoke to him as an old friend, asked news of his wife, stated that he had got a splendid place at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and requested him to bring him the next day a watch, two chains, and some other articles of jewelry for a lady. Though the tradesman did not know Gudfln, he went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and there that person declared that he had thought in writing his letter that he was another Aubry. The tradesman said that though he was not the Aubry in question he could supply him with the articles he wanted, and Gudfin, after some apparent hesitation, Faid that he might bring them the nextrmorningtothe house of the Princess Ghyka, on the Boulevard des Capu-
cines. The jeweller went there, and found Gudfin breakfasting tWc-d-0tz with the Princess. The apartment was magnificently furnished, and he subsequently learned that the rent paid by the Princess was 1,500f. a-month. The Princess examined the articles he brought, but made no selection. The next day, in compliance with Gudfin's order, be took various articles, worth 850f., to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and left them with him. " But what was the position of this man at the Ministry ?" asked the president of the court. "He was only an usher." "Did you make no inquiries about this Princess " " Yes, and was told that she was a real Moldavian Princess, and very wealthy." The witness went on to say that he called several times on Gudfin, both at the Ministry and at his lodgings, but could not get payment of his bill. After a while the man disappeared from Paris. Some time after he (the witness) met the Princess in her carriage, and requested her to pay the bill; but ehe said that she had purchased nothing, and that Gudfin alone was responsible. A deposition of a man named Benoux was then read. It was to the effect that he and Gufdfin, five years ago, were servants to Count de Sircourt, and it was on that account probably that Gudfn had transformed the Count into his intimate friend; also that in June, 1S56, Gudfin and the Princess Ghyka came to a c;fe at which he (Renoux) was waiter, and that, after dining there together, Uudfn had borrowed 60f. from him, which were neverrepaid. In borrowingthe money Gudfin had given his address at the Hotel du Nord, and when Benoux went therehe fotmd that he had left. At that hotel the mnn had caused himself to be inscribed under the name of M. de Jean, probably because his Christian name was Jean. The witness added that he knew that Gudfin and the Princess Ghyka had lived together at Montinorenoy. The Princess Ghyka was then called, but it was stated that she had returned to Moldavia. The declarations she had made to the examining magistrate when the man's swindling was discovered were m consequence read. They were to the effect that Gudfin had completely duped her by representing himself as a high functionary, member of a noble family, possessed of great wealth, and a single man, whereas he was really married. The Tribunal condemned Gudfin to a year'g imprisonment and 50f., fine.- Giianan's hiMesselger.
FAr.& DUS; LN NEW ORTLEANS.-A hostile meeting took place yestarday, at 1 o'clock, at " The Oaks," between Packenham Lo Blanc, Deputy-Sheriff of the Supreme Court, and George W. White, the bookeeper of N. C. tolger, of 014 Levee-btreet. The immediate insult that led to the challenge and the duel was of the grossest kind, and demande4an appeal to the most deadly redressamong those who abide by tbo "code of honour," or who have manhood to resent the most rnprtdonable oflience. The cause that led to this insualt being offered was the refusal of the committeo of invitation to one of our public balls to issuel a ticket ofsadmittance for a friend of Mr. Packenham LA Blanc. The gentleman, considering himsself affronted, concluded to visit his displeasure on one of the committee and chance, as we have reason to believe, was the cause of Mr. White being selected. He was met by Mr. Le Blanc who spat in his face. They met yesterdav at " The Oaks,"; the conditions of the duel being double barreled shot guns, 20 pace, and to fire at the word. Two seconds of each gentleman were on the ground. The word was given, and 1lz Le Blanc fell mortally wounded, discharging his gun as

PPARLIAM.ENTARY INTELLIGENCE.
HOUSE OF LORDS, FRIDAY, FEB. ]3.
The LORD CiHAJNCELLOR took his seat on the woolsack at 5 o'clock.
Lord SH.AFTESBURtY presented petitions from w6rking men. inihabitants of Clerkenwell, praying for measures In aid of emuigration; and from Witniey against the traffic in opium.
THE WAR WITH CHiNA.
The Earl of DERBY gave notice that as soon as the papers were laid on the table of the House relating to the recent hostilities at Canton he should call the attention of their lordships to the subject, and briDg forward a specific n otion in reference to it; but Until the papers were produced he could not state the precise ternis -in which his motion would be franied. He would take this opportunity of asking a question of the noble earl, the .President of the Council. He observedwith regret that Her.Mlajesty'sGovernment, instead of taking upon themnselves the duty of bringing forward aimeasure in refervncetotheBank Charter, had moved to refer the subject to a select committee of the other House. Hle presumed it was also the intention of the Government to refer it to a select committee of their lordships' House, though he was not going to ask them to do so; but their lordships would recollect that in 1848 or 1849 the whole subject was carefully iniquired into by the Comnsittee on Conimmercial Distress, wvho, after a laborious investigation
resented an elaborate report to their lordships' ouse. f hat he wished to ask was whether, in the event of the Government not thinking it desirable to move for the ap. pointinent of another committee of this House, they woud have any objection to reprint the report of the committee of 184S or 1849.
Earl GRANVILLE said there would be no objectiou whatever to the report being reprinted.
THE ENCUMBERED ESTATES COURT.
The Marquis of CLANRICARDE, pursuant to notice, rose to ask a question, with the view7 to elicit the intentions of the Government touching the Encumbered Estates Court in Ireland. He said it might probably be thought that the answer given by the Lord Chancellor to a question on a previous evening had imparted all the necessary information on the subject; but their lordships would recollect that the eply of the noble and learned lord had reference only to filling up the vacancy in the Court caused by the retirement of Baron Richards, and that was but a small part of the matter. On a former occasion he had been promised that the subject of the Encumbered Estates Cosirt should be considered in all its bearings, that a commission should be appointed,
and a bill introduced for the general settlement of the ques-. tion. Last year there was a committee of the House of Commonis upon the subject, which committee took a great mass of evidence, and their first recommendation was that the system of conferring an indefeasible title on the purchasers of encumbered estates should be perpetuated, and that this advantage should be extended to unencumbered estates. There had therefore been a full consideration of this subject, and what reason could there be for any delay in acting in reference to it! From the evidence to which he had referred it would be found that the business of the Encuisibered Estates Court had entirely outgrown the constituted machinery of that court; that there were then three commissioners and 3.5 assistants, and that it would occupy them practically three years toclosethebusiness theyhad then o n hand. Instead, however, of reconstructing that court, and of transferring its business to another court; the only step taken by the Government was to reduce the number of comniissioners. He confessed that he could not understand upon what possible principle the Government could have recommended such a course; but the consequence was that an immense numiber of suitors had been most grievously wronged. Some hundreds of abstracts of titles bad been lodged in the office of the late Chief Commissioner, which had not been opened or investigated, while in a large number of cases the purchase money had been paid into court, but never distributed. He defied contradiction when he stated that what was called the Encumbered Estates Court in Ireland was at this moment creating, and not diininishing, the number of encumbered estates in Ireland, It was a notorious fact that people, procuring a better title than the original owner could show, borrowed money in order to effect purchases through the court, and that in some cases estates thus became even more heavily mortgaged than before the sale. If, however, the court was a popular one, why did the Government delay for one moment to bring in a bil placing the whole of the landed property of Ireland in the same condition as these encunmbered estates ? Was it just or equitable that a man who chose to call his estate encumbered, or who created an encunibrance in order to bring it within the operation of the act, should get ans indefeasible title, whereas a man was denied any such privilege, unless he sued, as it were, in fo7rsie patpseis i It was notorious that estates had been brought into court for the purpose of facilitatirg the raising of loans, which were more easily procurable upon a Parliamentary title. He also wished to know why, when the condition of Ireland was as prosperous as it ever had been, or perhaps as it was ever likely to be, in the case of estates sold by the Encumbered Court stamps were not required, while in the case of estates sold without the intervention of the court they were stiU necessary. It appeared to him to be practically a fraud upoa the public revenue, although, no doubt, the fact of there being no stamps to pay made these estates most agreeable to attorneys and solicitors. It was also of the highest importance that when arbitrary power was
laced in the hands of any court that that power should ceexereised in suCh a manner as to secure for the court the respect of all, while with regard to the present court, If it were made a permanent court, various changes would have to be made. Among those changes the locality of it would have to be changed, and it would have to be brought in closer connexion with the four courts, and thrown open to the whole bar of Ireland. He perceived that it was intended to ask Parliament for a sum of money to build a new court; but, as the court itself was to cease according to preeent arrangements in July, 1858, what was the reason for asking for a sum of money in 1857 ? He entreated the Government to legislate immediately upon the subject. The noble lord concluded by asking what were the intentions of the Government with regard to the Encumbered Estates Court, and by moving for a return of the number of abstracts of title in the office of the late Chief Commissioner of the said court not investigated at the time of the retirement from that office of the learned baron. and of the number of cases in which estates had been sold, but the proceeds of the sale not distributed at the same date; also for a copy of a late communication from the Commissioners to Her Majesty's Government upon the state of business in their court.
The LORD CHANCELLOR said that with regard to the vacancy which had been created in the Encumbered Estates Coart it either had been, or shortly would be, fiUed up. The Government had been informed that two commissioners would be able to perform all the duties of the court, but experienco proved that this was impossible, and therefore the vacancy either had already beeu, or very shortly would be, fiUed up. With regard to the permanence of this court he had two or three years before intimated his opinion that it ought to be a permanent establishment, and a commission had been appointed to renort as to the best mode of accomblishing that object. that commission had suggested that the court should not remain an independent court, but should in some manner be connected with the Court of Chancery, and biUs framed upon that suggestion had been introduced into the House of Commons, and, after being referred to a select committee, had not been adopted. The subject was under the careful consideration of the Government, and as yet he was not prepared to state the exact course which would be adopted.
The returns were ordered.
PROPERTY OF MIARRIED WOMhEN.
Lord BROUGHAM, in rising to call the attention of the Hlouse to the rights of property of married women, said that he could not abstain from expressing his great-and, indeed, hardly to be expressed-gratification at an important event which had taken place in the House of Commons since he had last addressed their lordships. In the House of Commons a unanimous resolution had been agreed to in favour of the establishment of a department of public justice,-a step about which he had never felt any didiculty, although he knew that many persons had. He had for years been urging upon Parliament in every possible shape the absolute necessity for no longer being without the inestimable benefit of such a department. In adopting the resolution of Thursday night the House of Commons had acted upon the recommendation of Lord Bacon, and he was glad to hear that that House had been unanimous and hearty in its approval of a department of justice. It might be said that now there was every hope of so desirable a consummation being carried into effect by the Government he might withdraw fromn the position which, according to a jocular remark of a noble and learned friend, he (Lord Brougham) had so long filled as " Charge d'Affaires" of that department.
Lord CAMPBELL was understood to suggest that the noble and learned lord might be the First Minister of Justice.
Lord BROUGHAM said the duties of such an officer would be so onerous, so important, that, even were he not determ.ined never to undertake any office at his mature a^e he would not venture to assume the responsibilties of such a
department. Happily, all difficulty would give way to the acknowledged insportance of the subject, and he had little doubt that they would soon see the creation of that department. Hlowever, until the arrival of a minister of justice, hiB own duties as Charg6 d'Afaires of that department
conl no 11bDe said to be entirelyabolished. -He -w'oluld ...p'roceed tothe special subject which he had to bring under their lordsbhips' notice that evening-the grievazces of married women, especially in respect to their property. He
had presented a petition signed by 2,000 of their felloxv countrywomen, of all classes-some earning wages by daIly work, some with property, the gift of friends or deeased relatives, and some earning incomes, often large, by the exercise of industry, of admairable genius as authoresses, artists in painting and sculpture, and the names of several such distinguished persons gave weight to the prayer of that petition. It must be remembered that by the law as it stood at present those earnings might be entirely abstracted from those -whose labours had procured them, and were capable of being vested, without a moment's delay or one word of warning, in their husbands, that the earnings would hbe-not the wife's, who by her labour, skill, or genius had gained them, but her husband'-he who had no share in earning them, and -who miight be as worthle.s as she who had worked for them 'was uindoubtedly meritorious. That was the law of Englanxd. To show the grievous hard. ships whichl might and did occur he would maention a case which he lied heard from a naoble lord in the house, of a woman industrious, anid he was assured a good woman who bad married a gcodfor.nothiug fellow. She ssparatedfom. him and took to shoemiaking, in which, by her industry and hrugality, she managed to scrpe together 201. or 301., when her husband, who had no0t only desrted her, but lived witbh another woman, hearing that his wife had saved mnoney, for a moment quaitted his paramour, rushed upon the capital his wife had accumulated, anid not only took that, hut also eel-
lected all the debts due to her, and then, leaving heragain to ,tarve, returned to his nfitsress. Then there was a ease which had come to his own knowledge, in which he had heard the statement of the party, had made inquiries, and was perfectly convinced of the accuracy of the statement. A gentlewoman had been deserted by~ her husband, who went to the goldi min es of Australia with another woman, and left the wife totally unprovided for. Being wUelcduicated, she set up a school, and succeeded after a year or two in establishing a flourishing senunary,. and.he wvas informed that no one could better merit success than she did. In the meantime, however, the husband's maining speculations having proved unsuccessful, he returned to this country, instantly rushed upon that other mine which his wife had opened, and not only seizedl the gold which she had accueiulated, but broke up the school by selling the furnitwre and collecting the debts; having done which he left his wife again and returned to his paramour. It was not to be denied that such cases were extreme cases, but nevertheless they were such as might happen to any one. He could refer to csses which were of mnore frequent occurrence. It would be observed that those grievances ehieflv affected the miiddle anad humbler classes. The husband's right t) defraud his wife, for fraud it muist be called, might not always he carriedI to the extent as in the cases which he had mentioned, but the common case was of a woman married to a drunken, idle geoda-for.nothing, who, not choosing to work himself, preferred to live at his wife's expense. Their lordslips had only to go into any great manufactur-
igtown in Lancashire in order to see the consequence of the law as it at p resenjt stood. He was told that there would be found besieging the door where the workwomen were receiving their weekly weges the husbands of ther
wome'n, who were obtaining, not by soft violence, but in many cases by severe pressure, the mnoney which t'hey had just received at the pay table. It was said that an alteration of the law would have a tendency to beget quarrels, but those -who would go to Oldham, to which town his information more particularly applied, and there see the husbands lying in wait for the mtoney of their wvives, would see that the present law was very far from exempting marriedl couples from the inciderst of qjuarrels. At a iiieeting of the Law Amendmient Society in Juine, which was presided over by that most honourable and uiseful public man, Sir J. Pakeington, a detailed statement was made by a manufacturer (Mr. Musgrave, as we understood) emnploying a large numnber of workwomen, earning from 90s. to 40s. a-Nveek, maany of whom, he said, were sought in marriage by men who had the design before marriage to live idle upon the wages earnedlby their wives. This manufacturer gave 10 different instances of the truth of his statement, and added that the women whose wages were thus taken from them were suffered to go disreputably ragged, while their children were miserably provided for, The evil being apparent, the question was as to the remedy. The testimony of thes poor womaen was decisive as to the existence of the evil, although they might not all agree as to the remedy, or be the best judges of what ought to be done for their relief. The general opinion was in favour of doing for these women who married without settlements what the law did for persons who died without a will. If a man died intestate the law made a will for him, and so it was suggested that when parties married without makcing a marriage settlement the law, following the analogy of wills, should make a settlemient for them. If parties chose to make a settlement for thiemselves before marriage, and to tie up their property, then the law need not interfere. Otherwise let the woman obtain her property as a fenme sole, with the provision that the husband should not be liable to her debts either before marriage or during coverture, anad following in all respects the analogy of the feme sole. [A Noble Lord.-The children?]t The children should be miaintained by beth husband and wife, the wife being equally liable with the husband. This was the law in the greater part of the United States. Both lawyers and laymeni agreed that it had answered perfectly, and they laughed at the idea of its tending to produce quarrels. There was somae little doubt as to a wife's right to her own earnings in France; hut there was no doubt as to her right to her real property, and there was no material difference with regard to the rights enjoyed by a wife between the French and English law. But the remedies gOven to the wife in France were miuch superior to those given to her in this country. Not only had she a right to apply for a se.pairation de biens, either with or without a se~paration de corpys, but she could also obtain an autom-msalion-an authority by which her property was placed beyond the reach of her husband. This was not an ex ta s r
ceeding, for if the husband appeared lie was heard,and t7h-e judge, after an examination of all the circiunistances, decided the case. Mr. Macqueen related an anecdlote which illustratedl the effect of this law. A washerwoman belonging to the betel which that gentlemnan was inhabiting was married to a man who had deserted her ; the creditors of her idle, worthles, dissipated husband claimed her earnings, hut she was allowed leave of absence from her work for hauf-a-day, and by the timne she returned sihe had obtained an autor-i.stion, which effectually protected her anid prevented the creditors from touching a farthing. He had hseard an anecdote which illustrated the effect of the English law. A.French gentlewoman, not being successful ini her business in Paris, camae, by the advice of an English lady, to London, where she established, and for some time carried on, a floun'shing buies Her husband heard of her success adcm oEgad swept away all her earnings, and cletdhrdbs She returned to Paris, saying to her Egihfin,"b Madam, how can you bear to live insuhabraoscntV'Hvgno stated his cae he woul not trouble thrlodisan further. Hle intended to mnove reolution,arigta the law urgently required amendmnent, tha ieogtt have entire control over the whole ofheprety b utta if it should be found impracticable togiehrtenie
roprty the othe and the smaller rmd to which he ad ref erred should be allowed her.Hesol then in. troduce a bill carefully yUpared byalerd andl worthy colleague of his in the w AxaendLment Societ,cryn into effect the first and most effectual remed.H a
been'told that it was hopeless to expect thasuhabl would pass, but he comnforted himself by remerbrn h observation of Lord Bacon, that no imnprovemen n~rs prudence founded upon a good Principle was everpreod 'which did not sooner or later bear fr-uit, howevEear desperate its chance of success might at first apPear. There was a time when all men despaired of the possibility of abolishing the slave trade; hut the day came when that enormnity was brought to a close so far as this country was concerned. Then, again, for about 20 years the demand for the abolition of slav7ery itself was by many believed to be hopeless, and yet they lived to see the system of slavery put down. The labours of Romilly, too, might be recalled to comfort those who were engaged in what might appear a hopeless struggle. When that distinguished individual brought in a bill to compel maen to do what all honest mnen did-pay their debts out of their freehold estates-he was opposed with as much determlination as if the measure had involved a confiscation of property. That little modicum of reform was carried, and then came those other attempts of his to miitigate the severity of the criminal law 'which had reflected so mnuch honour on his memory, and we had lived to see the full fruits of his labours, almost all capital offences having now been struck- off our criminal code. Even within the last 14 or 15 years many safe and prudlent raeasures of law reform, at first opposed, had been successfully carried. In 184 he brought in nine bills for the amendment of the law. Every one of those hills seemedl then to be hopeless,, but seven of them were the law of the land 'within five or six years afterwards, one of them being that important measure whichi aloedprte to be examined as witnesses. These were
hisgrondsforentertaining a sanguine-he could hardly say acnietepecitation that the present measure, as one founded on the same principle, 'Would ere long pas into a law, and thus give inexpressible relief to a mnost interestins portion of the community. The noble and learned lor~l concluded by moving his resolution.
Earl GRANVILLE said it was matter of deep regret that the noble and learned lord should be obliged to leave this country, and that it would naot be in his power to assLt their lordships in the consideration of those most important law reforms to which their attention would be drawn. Wish regard to the question of the rights of married women, to which the noble and learnedl lord had just directed their notice, he had summed up in a most lucid and satisfactory manner, and illustrated with his peculiar, talents all that had been p~reviouslv said In their lordshipsb ouse on that subject. The evilsftowhich he had referred wer-e admitted to be great, and, though some of thein were, no doubt, incidental to the relations that existed between the sexes, yet it was universally admitted and acknowledged that the law did create artificial difficulties and artificial evils of its own. (Hlear, hear.) With regard to the resolution proposed by his noble and learned friend, he presumed that he ouly took that mode of leaving on record his views of the subject, and that it was not his wish to commit the Honusein any way to the expression of en opinion regarding it, Hoecould only say that he had listened with great interest and admiration to the statement of the noble and learned lord, who was so well entitled to be heard, considering the great and extraordina-ry efforts he had made in the cause of law reform. That there was great room for an imaprovement of the law was almost universally admitted; hut the chief obstacle to the removal of the evils that existed lay in this, that when any practical measure was brought forward with that object there arose such a differesice of opinion amnong those who were connected with t'he profession of the law regarding it as to p resent almost insuperable difficulties to its bing carried. He hoped the speeach bf the noble and learned lord on the great and important subject to which it related would have the effect of narrowing the difficulties that surrounded the question, and his'hopo was that somne satisfactory conclusion regardin- it
-oue c aravu --at duin the prsn seson d ei.
would-be arrived at during the pres-ent s-e-ss-ion,"arn-d bef6or~e the noble and learned lord returned, (Hear, hear.)
I,ord CAMPBELi, felt that this was not the time to enter into the details of the proposal made by his noble and learned friend, though he was ready to concur in the general sipirit of the resolution. The law of this country as regarded married women was barbarous, and he hoped a remedy would soon be provided. He was above al desirous to see a better mode of enabhin women to separate from their husbands who deserted tem or used them cruelly. He confessed he thought that most of the objects sought to be attained by his noble and learnedfriend wouldbeattained by the bill which the Lord ChanceUor had recently introduced, and therefore that the necessity for his noble and learned friend's resolutions was the less apparent. (Hear, hear.) When his noble and learned friend was introducing his proposal to the House he (Lord Campbell) thought he heard a noble earl ask what was to become of the children of a marriage in case it passed into a law. That was a very natural question, and as it appeared to him (Lord Campbell) conclusive to show the impolicy of any such proposition. Was the wife, for instance, to be committed to prison in case she refused to contribute her proper share to the expenses of the menage Y He contended that the proposal would lead to perpetual discord among married persons, and prove detrimental to dornestic happiness.
The LORD CHANCELLOR was about to put the resolutions, when
Lord CAMPBELL moved the adjournment of the debate to this day six weeks.
After a fow words in reply from Lord BRO MUsi3M, the motion Of Lord Campbell Was agreed to.
TePUBLIC WORKS IN IRELAN~D.
TheEal of LEITRI moved for a copy of the reports of the commissOner aPPointd by the Lords Commisioners of
Her Maje.ty's Treasury to audit and rerort on the accounts of the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, and particularly such as referred to the fraads committed by the Assistant Accountant about the years 1847 and 14g8.
Agreed to.
The same Noble Earl also moved for a copy of the applicainons made to the Lord-LiEutenont of Ireland for the office of the Clerk of the Crown of the county of Leitrim, togethar with the recommendations of the several candidates, and the correspondence with reference to the recea: appointment to that office.
Earl GRANVILLE submitted to the noble earl that it was impousib'e to furnish a return of that nature - bah
offered to supply a copv of the correspondence which had passed between the noble earl and the Government on the subject.
The Earl of LEITRIM said the correspondence would he usele ss to him without the rest of the papers.
The motion was then withdrawn, and the House adjourned at 7 o'clock.

PERCUSSION CAPS.
Lord BURGHLEY asked the Under-Secretary of State for War whether it was the intention of Her Majesty's Government to adopt for the army, instead of the present regulation copper caps, Eley's elastic waterproof percussion caps.
Mr. PEEL said the caps referred to had been ordered to be adopted iu the senrice, but the machinery for their manufacture had not yet been erected.
THE ARCTIC MEDAL.

Sir C. WOOD believed the most complete answer he could give would be to read from a notification which ap. peared in the Looto Gazette of that day fortnight, stating that a medal had been granted, and would be distributed as follows:-
"1. To the officers, seamen, and Marines of Her Majesty's ships and vessels employed on the several voyages to the Arctic Seas during the specified period (between 1818 and 1855, inclusive), and also to the officers of the French navy, and to such volunteers as accompanied those expeditions.
" 2. To the officers, seamen, and others who were engaged in the expeditions to the Arctic Seas equipped by the (overnment and citizens of the United States.
"3. To the commanders and crews of the several expeditions which originated in the zeal and humanity of Her Mfajesty'd subjects.
' * 4. To persons who have served in the several land expeditions, whether equipped by Her Majesty's Government, by the Hudson's Bay Company, or from private resources."
The medals would be ready for delivery in about a month.
SAVINGS-BANKS. In reply to Sir H. WILLOUGHBY,
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said he had a bill prepared on the subject of savings-banks, and would ask leave to introduce it on an early day.
THE GREEK LOAMN.
Mr. J. MACGREGOR asked the First Lord of the Treasury if any and what steps had been taken by the Government to ascertain the present revenues of Greece, how they were disposed of, and the probability of their being adequate to reheve the Consolidated Fund of the 47,0001. paid annually for the interest and sinking fund of the GXreek loan guaranteed by this country under the act 2!d and 3d ofWilliam IV., chap. 121, and 6th and 7th of William IV., chap. 04, or any part thereof.
Lord PkLHtERSTON maid much communication had passed between the British, French, Greek, and Russian Governments on the subject to -which the question related, and the result had been that a commission was to be ap. pointed, consisting of the three representatives of the protecting Powrers at Athens in conjunction with a Greek colleague. They were to examine into the financial condition of Greece, and to report to the three Governments the result of their inquiries. Hle had no doubt their inquiries would be as benefcial to the interests of Greece as satisfactory to the guaranteeing Powers. (Hear, hear.)
CHAPTERS AND CANONRIES.
Mr. S. HIERBERT asked the First Lord of the Treasury whether it was the intention of the Government to bring in any bill during the present session to regulate cathedral eapters; and whether it was intended to renew the act 16thandl7th of Victoria, chap. 35, by which all appointments to capitular offices were made subject for two years to the provisions of any measure which might be passed, founded on the report of the Cathedral Commission of 18.2;* and whether any stipulation had been made with thej canons lately appointed that they shall hold their eanonries subject to the provisions of future legislation.
Lord PALMERSTON said the Govermnent had not, at present any intention of proposing a bill upon the subject.
ince he bad been in office he had appointed, he believed, one canon; but it did not occur to 1im to enter into stipulations, and no stipulations of the sort had been made.
NATIONAL GALLERY.
Mr. OTWAY asked whether it was the case that Mr. Ford, one of the Royal Commissioners appointed to determine the site of the National Gallery, had resigned his appointment, and.iffso, whether it was the intention of Her Majesty's Government to recommend any other gentleman for the vacant office.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said it was quite true that Mr. Ford, who was appointed a member of that commission, had been unable to act, and it was not the intention of the Government at present to fill up his place.
Mr. VERNON, who had given notice of a question on the same subject, said he mighit, perhaps, be allowed to inquire still more emphatically of the First Lord of the Treasary whether the Government rould not think it right to fill up the vacancy which many persons much regretted wvas cauzed by the refusal of MIr. Ford to act on that commission.
Lord PAL31ERSTON said the Chancellor of the Exchequer had stated that, as far as the Government were informed, it was not necessary to appoint any one in the place of Mr. Ford. If it should appear to be desirable the Government would fill up the vacancy.
RELATIONS WITH PERSIA.
On tho motion that the SPEARER leave the chair,
Mr. LAYARD said,-Before you leave the chair, Sir, I wish to ask a question of the noble lord at the head of the Government on a subject to which I attach great importance,-I mean our relations with Persia. At the beginning of this week I gave notice of a motion on the subject. I did so notwithstanding that the President of the Board of
Control had stated negotiations were taldng place at Paris, and a selection of papers would be laid on the table. My reason for persisting was this :-It is almost unprecedented that a war should be entered on virtually while Parliament Is sitting, and peace concluded while Parliament is sitting, witliout Parliament having an opportunity of expressing its opinion upon so important a subject
Another reason was that I am led to be=ieve we are about to enter into treaty engagements with Persia which may involve, to a serious extent, our relations with the States of Central Asia. I believe that there are many gentlemen in this house and in the country who agree with me in that opinion. I there-
fore think, before the treaty is signed at Paris, and tht, country forms engagements which may lead berea ter to serious complications and to many wars, that the House should have an opportunity of expressing an opinion upon our Central Asian policy. I have been told privately that the negotiations are in such a state that a debate in t-nis housa might lead to their interruption and to the continuance of war. The greatest of all evils is the conrtiuation 5.f war, and, as I should be most imprudent under snch circumstances to press the debate, I beg to ask the noble lord at the head of the Government whether he will state seriously and positively that a debate in this hoase up;,n the Persian question would so far interfere with the negotiations as to prevent their succesful issae, and to leai to a continuation of the war. If the noble lord make that statement I must throw myself upon the House, at the san e time protesting against the policy of the war as dangeroas and bad. If, on the other hand, the noble lord will not state that a debate will lead to the interruptioni of neg, tiations, I trust that the House wiU enable me on the earliest dayperhaps on Monday next-to brine forward the subject, so as to obtain the opinion of the iouse upon a question of the nost vital importance to the interests of the country. (Hear, hear.)
Lord PALMERSTON.-Of comse, it is impos.ible for any person to say what will necessarily be the result of anything that is going to happen (a laugh); but we are in negotiation at present with Persia in Paris, and I think, upon a general view of the matter, that persons less experienced in diplomacy than my hoe. friend must see that a debate upon the subject of negotiations could not fail to produce very injurious consequences, (Hear, hear.) Whether it would occasion a continuance of the war is more than I can possibly tell, but certainly I can undertake to say, as a Minister of the Crown, that negotiations having been commenced, and having hitherto been conducted in a promising manner, such negotiations must be very much damaged and the public interests must be injured by a discussion in this House founded upon imperfect information and bearing upon many points which may, perhaps, be settled in negotiation. Speeches by persons who are imperfectly informed of the facts must necessarily have an injurious effect, aud I assure the House that it is the anxious desire of the Government to conclude peace with Persia upon eonditions which shall be honourable and satisfactory to both eountries, and which shall give some fair security for a continuance of peace. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. BAILLIE.-Has the noble lord any objection to lay upon the table of the house a copy of the ultiinatum which was sent to the Persian Government previons to the declaration of war? This is the first time that this country ever engaged in a war without knowing what it was about. We are told that we are fighting because Persia has taken possession of the city of Herat - but the rersians say that it is no such thing, but that Eugland has made fresh demands upon Persia. If the dispute had been about Herat Lord Stratford de Redeliffe would have settled it long ago at Constantinople. What are the fresh demands, then, that England has made upon Persia, and wiU he lay upon the table of the house a copy of the ultimatum which was sent to the Persian Government? (Hear, hear.)
Lord PALIERSTON.-I fear that I cannot undertake to do that because it would be making a statement with regard to matters which are the subject of negotiations yet in progress, which would be contrary to every rule, and injunous, probably, to the interests of the eountry.
Mr. ROEBUCL-It would seem, then, Sir, that the boasted supervision of this House is a farce. (Hear, hear.) Let us consider a little the circumstances in which we are placed. A war has been declared, and of that war the House of Commons knows nothing. The war has been commenced and carried ont and the Hiouse of Commons knows nothing of the transaction. We are informed that negotiations are proceeding, and when a question isput with regard to them we are told that the House of Commons knows nothing, andoughtto knownothing, so thatwe are now in this position:-If we put a question before an accident happens we are toldthat we are too soon; if we put itwhile the transactions are going on we are told that we are intermeddling; and if we come to the House and inquire after the transaction is terminated we are told that we are too late. (Hear, hear.) I woald ask, then, when is the House of Commons to inquire-before the mischief happens, while it is going on, or when it is ended? At no time. I repeat, then, that the boasted supervision of this House is a farce. We pretend to govern te country; we pretend to overlook tho conduct of the Ministry; but, instead of that, we st by in silence; England may have every interest ccmplicated and endangered, the very power of this country may be at stake, and the House of Commons dare not say a word becausethe Minister tells them that they are either too soon or too late.
LordJ. RUSSELL.-The circumstances of the present time with regard to the Persian war appear to me to be unusual. I will not now raise the question whetherthe Government ought to havo assembled Parliament before they gave orders for hostilities against Persia; but that question being set aside, we are in this peculiar position, that at the same timne that we are informed of hostilities having been ordered and undertaken we are likewise in. formed that negotiations have been commenced at Paris, and, as my noble friend has just stated, they have boen opened in a promising manner. It appears to me that that position is quite peculiar, and I certainly think that it is ono which requires the forbearance of this House. (Hear, hear.) I can wel conceive, if all the papers were now produced, and a discussion were to arise upon them, that the terms demanded by England before the war might be commented upon by some hon. gentlemen as impolitic and excessive, and it is clear that such observations might tend to embarss and disturb the negotiations which are now in progress. I can conceive, for example, that Feruk Ehan, or any one who is negotiating with Lord Cowley, might take encouragement from such a discussion in this house, and might not be so ready to agree to reasonable terms as would otherwise be the case ; and therefore, though the circumstances are very peculiar, and though in an ordinary case it would be right to ask for the papers, I can very weU imagine that the Governmmet may be justified in withholding them now. (Hear, hear,) I believe, however, that the suspense cannot be very long. The majority of the points at issue were discussed repeatedly at Constantinople, and the Government must be well aware what the terms are which they mean to insist upon, and what those are which they will not press. I imagine, therefore, that we shall either hear before long that there has beea rupture of the negotiations, or that we shall be informed of the terms which have been agreed upon between Ferak Khan and Her Majesty's Plenipotentiary. In either case the silence of the Government may then be broken and every particular respecting the negotiations and the circumstances which preceded hostilities can then be communicated to Parliament. It may happen even if peace should be concluded that the circumstances under which hostilities were undertalkcen may not'appear to be such as to justify the Government for having commenced warlike operations, and then it will be open to my hon. friend the member for Aylesbury, or to any other member, to raise a discussion upon the subject without any danger of that injury to the public interest which might now arise. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. GLADSTONE.-I confess that it appears tome that it would be very difflicult for the House to arrive at any. thing in the nature of a satisfactory understanding at the present moment with respect to the policy of the Persian war. I fully admit the force of the general considerations which were urged by the noble lord the member for the city of London, and which were very fairly admitted by the hon. member for Aylesbury, that it is most undesirable that we should incur any risk of frustratin; negotiations which may possibly issue in the establishment of peace. At the same time there are other questions which are anterior in order to the discussion of the negotiations. We stand in the very peculiar position of being made aware that a war involving grave questions of policy has been undertaken by the Government on their own responsibility, and without the knowledge or sanction of Parliament. At present, as I understand, papers are in preparation which, while they are not to contain anything that in the judgment of the Government is likely to interrupt the negotiations, are notwithstanding to exhibit to us the causes of the war, and to put us in the possession of such information as shall enable us to exercise our constitutional function of judging whether the Government did or did not go beyond their powers, aud whether they did or did not make a judicious and constitutional use of those powers in waging war against Persia. I frankly own myself that I can form no judgment whatever upon this subject until I have seen those papers. (Hear, hear.) When we see the papers, which will tell us the time when instructions were sent out for despatcbhig the expedition from Bombay, and which will disclose the causes of the war, then I think wDIl be the time for members of this House to consi-
der whether it is necessary to raise any question with regard to the objects of the war, and to the conduct of the Government in having commenced it. (Hear, hear.) With respect to the negotiations, it is impossible at the present time for the House to give, either by expression or silence, any absolute pledge upon the subject. We must, in the first instance, see the papers, and until we have seen the papers and have considered the origin of the war it is imspossible for us to know how far the Governmmen is in a condition to ask for the confidence of the House with referenceto the conduct of the negotiations. The hon. member for Aylesbury will take whathe may think the most prudent course with regard to immediate discussion, but we cannot he precluded by anything which has taken place to-night from raising the question relative to the origin of the war. I am not sure whether I heard the noble lord the member
for the dty of London rightly, hut I understood him to say that some questions had been set aside. It does not appear to me that the question with resnect to the originand causes of the war has been set aside;* on the contrary, I think that it remains fully and entirely open for thse future consideration and judgment of Parliament. (Hear, hear.)
Lord J. RUSSELLo-The right hon. gentlemanl has misunderstood me. WVhat I said was, that the question remains entirely open for the discussion of the House.
Mr. DISRAELI.-I think, Sir, the House should be very jealous of the plea of negotiations when a war has commenced. Before a war is commenced, when there is a niis-
understanding between two Governments, of course the greatest forbearance ought to be shown by an assembly liko the House of Commons; but when hostilities have began, when they are in progress and raging, we should not beprevented from eithercriticizing the causes ofthe war or enter ing into the progress and conduct of thewarbythe fact being alleged that some negotiator, obscure or otherwise, is negtiating or attempting to negotiate with tho Govern-
nent. Negotiations tave frequently been carried on durin
Iho progress of a war. Russlawasconqueredbythe Emperor Napoleonwhilenegotiations were in progressbetweentho Russian Government and France. It is most importaut hat we should clearly understand whether the negotiations which are taking place upon the subject of Persia are sound negotiations, and whether there is a fair probability of tl,eir being carried to a successful terumination. We ought to know also whetber the negotiator in Paris, who may be successful, is the unsuccessful negotiator of Conshantinople. I agreewith the noble lord the wember forthe city of Londn that this is a subject which requires soine forbearance; but :t th e same time it is one which we ought to view with jealousy, for we may find that the Persian war may proceed, and we may be involved in more than one cam paign, while during the whole of that period the existence of negotiations niay bo used by the Government to prevent discussion. Buit, Sir, there is one subject on which I think I may ask for the papers without at aU embarrassing negotiations, and it is with resnect to our interference in the affairs of the kingdom of the Two Sicilies. I was led to understand by the Speech from the Throne that these papers would be laid on the table, and, considering all that has occurred, I did believe that on the first day Parliament met they would have been in our bands. We have now been in session nearly a fortnight; these papers are not in our possession; and I must urge the noble lord at the head of the Government speedily to produce documents which long before tlhis oghtto have been in the hands of the members of the House of Commons. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. GIBSON.-I beg to remind the House of one declaration which the First Lord of the Treasury has already made to us-vis., that this country is to pay half of the expt_uses of the war with Persia. Now, seeing that the Gover-ment have pledged the industry of England to pay for the Persian campaign, I think they ought- when the war was eommenced, to have given some little information to Parliament with respect to the origin and causes of the war.
The motion was then agreed to, and the House went into Committee of Supply, MIr. FT7.ROY in the chair.
THE FINANTCIAL STATEMAENT.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER rose at a few minutes past 5 o'clock, in a crowded house, to make his annual financial statement. The right hon. gentleman sail ,- Sir, however conscious I may be of the difficalty of the task which I am about to discharge, I can assure the committee that my feelings would be altogether misconstrued if it were supposed that I felt any reluctance to make to them at the earliest opportunity a statement of the expenditure and revenue of the country. The committee are well aware that the ordinary course is first to conider the principal estimates for tho great services, especialy the army and navy, in Committee of Supply, and then, when some progress has been made with those esti. mates, it becomes the duty of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to submit to the House the ways and means by which the expenditure of the ensuing year mnay be met. As soon as I became aware that it was the general wish of the House that the financial statement should be made before tho estimates for the army and navy were considered in Committee of Supply, I gave notice of my intention to make that statement to-day. LWt the committee observe that this is the earliest day on which the finanoial statement could be made. It was only on Monday last-the last Government night-that, in Committee of Supply, an address was agreed to to the Crown to present the estimates for the army and na-vy. Those estimates have since been presented. This is the second Committee of Supply; but the estimates being now on the table, and no Toto having been taken in Committee of Supply, no Committee of Ways and Means has been appointed. Hence this is the first occasion, being the second time when a Committee of Supply has sat, on which it was competent to me to make the statement which I am about to address to the committee. (Hear, hear.) Now, Sir, I think the committee must be satisfied that there has been no delay or reluctance on my part to lay before them the annual financial statement. In ordinary years it is no doubt desirable that the consideration of the army and navy estimates should take precedence. I fully admit, however, that in extraordinary years, such as the present one, it may be convenient to adopt a different course. The reason of the usual procedure is this-the House fixes what expenditure is necessary, and then, the expenditure being fixed, it is the duty of the executive Government to submit to the House a plan by which that expenditure may be defrayed. But, although a considerable portion of the expenditure of the country may be regarded as necessary and essential, as inevitable for the service of the year, there is also a not inconsiderable portion as to which a discretion may exist. There are certain expenses which may not be thought necessary in one year, but postponed to a future year. There are certain purposes to which expenditure may be applied to a greater or a less degree, which may be accomplished in a more or less complete manner, and as to which, therefore, the House maLy reasonably say, " We wish to know what is the pressure of taxation in the country, and whether any impost may be justly regarded as grievous and oppressive, before we agree to a portion of the expenditure which is not necessary, bat with respect to which we may exercise a fair discretion." (Hear.) Sir, this is undoubtedly a period to which that description applies. We are passing from war to peace, from a period of large expenditure to a period of comparatively restricted expenditure, and it is a reasonable demand on the part of the House of Commons that they should be informed of the probable taxation, of the probable ways and means of the ensuing year, before they enter upon thc consideration of the estimates. My hon. friend who moved the address on the first night of the session drew what he described as a lamentable picture of a Chancellor of tho Exchequer suffering under the pangs of repletion. He spoke of the numerous applicants for relief at a time wheu the country might expect an excess of revenue over ex. peuditure, and he bestowed upon me great commiseration for the position in which I should be placed during the first weeks of the session. Sir, I accept with great gratitude the sympathy of myhon. friend. At the same time, I cannot but feel that the task which I have to perform this year is far more agreeable than the corresponding tasks which I have performed in former years, when I had to ask this House to agree to increased taxation, when I had to represent to them the necessity of imposing additional burdens upon the country, and when I had to ask them to sanction loans and vote Exchequer-bills for the purpose of covering a large deficiency in the aunual income. That, Sir, is an additional reason why I should not be unwilling to come forward at the earliest opportunity to lay before the committee a statement of the finances of the year. I shall begin by calling the attention of the committee to the expenditure and the revenue of the cur. rent financial year, commencing on the 1st of April last and ending on the 1st of Apri next. I shall do so not merely for the purpose of comparison and information, but also for the purpose of removing some important misapprehensions which, if I may judge from what I havo observed in the house since- the beginning of the session, appear to me to prevail with respect to the expenditure and taxation of the current year. In the statement I made last session I estimated the revenue of the current year, ending the 1st of April next, at 71, 740, 0001. 1 ought before I proceed further to remind the committee that, as the financial year is still incomplete, I am obliged to estimate both the revenue and expenditure for the unexpired portion of the year-that is, for a portion of the month of February, and for the whole of the months of March. I believe, however, that the estimate I have made for that period will prove to be sutafciently accurate for the purpose for which it has been framed; but at the same timo I must ask the committee to remember, while following the figures I am about to read, that the revenu , and expenditure for about six weeks rest upon estimato and not upon account. Last session I estimated the revenuo of the current yearat 71,740,0001., while the actual and estimated receiptswill, I believe, somewhat exceed that amount, and will probably be about 71,885,0001. The itemn which presents a diminution on my estimate of lastyear is the revenue derived from Customs. I estimated the revenue from that source at 23,850,0001., and it will probably not produce more than 23,600,0001. That deficiency appears to be principaUy attributable to the short stock of
sugar, and in some degree to the check in the imiportation of tea. I will now read the details of the estimated revenue of 1856-7 and the sums actually received, together with the estimate of the further sums to be received up to the 31st of March nevt-
The expenditure for the year 1856-7, inclading the loan of 1,00.0001. to Sardinia, and a vote of credit for 2,000,0001, was estimated at 82,113,0001., showing, therefore, as compared with the estimated revenue, a deficiency of 10,373,0001. That sum represents the estimated deficiency of the present year, including the contingent margin which I allowed of 2,000,0001.; but, deducting that margin of 2,000,0001., the deficiency for the year wil be 8,373,000. In order to cover that deficiency certain loans were effected. In the first place we received 1,499,0001., being part of a loan of 5,000,0001. effected before Easter last year; a second loan of 5,000,0001. was effected after Easter, and there was an issue of 1,000,0001. of Exchequer-biUs, making the total amount of money borrowed during the current year 7,499,0001. The power conferred upon the executive Government of borrowing by Exchequer-biUs went to the extent of 4,' 00,0001., but they have only exercised it to the extent of 1,000,0001.,
and tbe service of the year will not require any further exercise of that power. (Hear, hear.) The act of last ! ses8ion was intentionally drawn in such a manner that the
power will expire on the Ist of April next, and I have I therefore to announce that the Government will then sur-
leader the powver of borrowiug 3,000,0001. for the service of tbo present year. The total receipts from revenue and fronm moneys raised by loan and by Exobequer-bills for the year 1856-7 may be set down at 79,384,0001. The actual expenditure of the year, including the payment of the loan to Sardinia, will probably amount to nearly 78,000,000i, leaving a balance of 1,384,0001. to be carried to the service of next year. (Hear, hear.) On the first night of the present session the night hon. member for Buekinghamshire stated tbat we are now in the extraordinary position of being subjected to vwar taxation during a timne of peace. If that epigrammnatic sentence has any very distinct meaning, I appre. hend it must be nnderstood to mean that we have war taxation during a year of peace expenditure; for if it has not that meaning it involves no objection to the coure taken by Her Mdajesty's Government. But I am desirous of impress' ing upon the committee that this has not bx en a year of ordinary peace expenditure (hear,), but that it hasbeen a year of extraordinary expenditure, that extraordinary expenditure baving been directly caused by the war which termi' nated only about ayearago. That this stateof things was fully within the cognizance of the House-that they were aware, when they agreed to the financial plans of last session, that this would not be a year of ordinary expenditure-must, I think be admitted by every hon. gentleman; bhut lest there should be any doubt upon a matter of such great importance I will, with the permission of the committee, read an extract from the statement I made last year at the time I pro. posed the plan of annual taxation. I most reluctantly refer to my own words, but I do so to show what was ,he understanding on the subject, and to satisfy the Heo, tbat, so far as I was able, l brought the state of the case clearly under their notice. On the 16th of last MIay, in addressing tllis House, I said,-
" Although peace has been happily concluded and ratified, and although we are not now in a state of war, nevertheless the present year, for all practical purposes, must be looked upon to a great extent a- a year ot war expenditure. The pre arations which have )eon made for a campaign, both by
and sea, during the winter and early part of this year were such that, had the war continued, we were in a condition to carry on this year's campaign most effectively, both with our laud and sea forces. That expenditure, I rejoics to say, has proved unnecessary; we have not been called upon to enter on a third campaign but, hevertheless, the expenditure was incurred. It willecome payable during the present year, and we shall not reap the entire benefitsof a return to a state of peace untilanotheryear. There wWll also be the expense of transporting our troops home from the Crimea; there will likewise be the expense of paying off the troops, and all the other expenditure connected with disbanding the army and navy, the whole of which will have to be defrayed during the present year. To these must be added the expense of the retranspot of. the Sardinian troops from the Crimea, which, though not necessarily part of our war expenditure, is yet connected with it, and is an expense which we ourselves undertook, and will be effected by our ships."
I think these remarks distinctly brought under the notice of the House the fact that the current year would not be a year of ordinary peace expenditure, and, as my statement was acquiesced in at the time, I assume that no doubt could be entertained as to the difference between the circumstances of the current year and those of an ordinary year. In addition to the extraordinary payments to which I havo adverted, a sum of 1,000,0001., which falls entirely upon the revenue of the current year, has been paid as the second instalment of the loan to Sardinia. A payment of 91,0001. has also beer, made, under the authority of an ac' passed last sessiou, for the redemption of an hereditary pension, but this may be regarded as the redemption of so much debt, and in the nature of an extraordinary payment. In addition to the extraordinary charges of the year there has also beon a loss in the war duty on malt, which was fixed to expire on the 5th of July next after the ratification of a definitive treaty of peace. The definitive treaty of peace was ratified on the 27th of April, 18.56, and the war duty on malt expired therefore at the beginning of the following quarter, which was the earliest period at which its expiration could take place. There is always a long credit given on malt, and the whole revenue is not lost, therefore, on the first year, so that the loss in the revenue on malt in the last year was only 220,0001. But what forms the principal defalcation in this branch of the revenue is the payment of a drawback upon the stock in hand which became necessary, and this amounted to about 800,000L, so that the loss upon the article of malt during the current year some. what exceeds 1,000,0001. sterling. That is a reduction from the revenue of the year which has already taken place in anticipation of a peace expenditure, and therefore it is not correct to say that no reduction of war taxation has been made in the present year. I am desirons of calling the attention of the committee to a few facts which I think importantas ilnstrating the elasticity of ournational resources, and the spring which the industry and trade of the country have taken immediately after the removal of the pressure of war. We know that even during the war the energy of thi5 country showed itself undiminished, while that of our rival underweut a perceptible decay:-
"Non Hydra secto corpore firmior
"Vinci dolentem crevit in Herculem."
These are facts which do not rest merely upon general assertions,-they admit of being reduced to numerical proofs, With the permission of the committee, I will briefly cal their attention to some of the most remarkable results of the tables recently laid upon our table. It is material that we should bear in mind the present state of our trade as compared with its state in former years, especially as we are told that the pressure of war taxation has been so great upon the country as sensibly to diminish its productive force and energies. I will first call the attention of the committee to the increase which has taken place in the value of our exports. 'The declared value of British exports in the year 1856 exceeded that of all previous years, and reached the sum of nearly 116,000,0001., being an increase of 20,202,0001., or 21 per cent. over those of 1855, and of 16,957,000, or 17 per cent. over those of 1853, tho year immediately preceding the war, in which, moreover, there was an unprecedented increase of exports. The declared value of the British and Irish exports for these three years was as folows :--153, 98,933,0001.; 1855, 95,688,0001,.; 1856, 115,890,0001. If we take some of the principal branches of our manufactures we shaU find the result equally encouraging. The exports of textile manufactures and yarns for these three years were :-1853, 52,299,0001. ; 1855, 51,123,0001. ; 1856, 59,915,0001. In the same way we find that the exports of metal fabrics of all kinds were :-1853, 19,563,0001. ; 1855, 17,892,0001.; 1856, 23,538,0001. These we may take as fair examples of the general increase which will be found to pervade the whole commerco of the country. I sball only take one article of our imports-raw cotton, and in this we find the increase tohavebeenasfollows :-1853, 746,709,0001b.; 1855, 767,406,0001b.; 1856, 877,814,0001b. The general result is, that our exports have doubled in value since She year 1849, and if wo compare this year with the year following the conclusion of the last great Earopean war, we shall find that we cominence this period of peace with exports three titmes greater than they were in 1816. The imports of grain were less in 1856 than in 1853, but greater than in 1855. The imports of grain from Russia fell to less than a half in 1854 and were suspended altogether in 1855, but reached 1,208,000quarter; in 1856, and were 14 per cent. of the total imports against 16 per cent. in 1853, showing the rapidity with which a suspended branch of trade was restored upon the restoration of peace. I am sorry to weary the committee with thesa details, but, after all that has been said, after the gloomy view which somo persons have taken of our present prospects, and the extent to which war taxation has dimi. nished the energies of the country, I think it is important that the committee should be put in possession of all the material facts bearing upon the position of the great branches of our trade and industry. If we turn now to the shipping of the country, taking the entries and
clearances together, we find that the tonnage of British vessels with cargoes in 1856 shows a considerable increase over aU former years. As compared 'with 185.5 there is an increase of 1,760,000 tons, or 19 per cent., and of 1,906,000 tons in comparison with 1853. In order to comfort those gentlemen who some few years ago anticipated the ruin of the shipping of this country by the alteration of the navigation laws, I will venture to read the figures for three years representing the tonnage of vessels with cargoes entered and cleared. They are as foUows:-
IBrtish. Foreign. Total. Tons. TOes. Tons,
1853 ... 9,064,000 6,316,000 15,380,000 1855 ... 9,211,000 6,156,000 15,367,000 1856 ... 10,971,000 6,933,000 17,904,000
The committee will remark that though 1S55 was a year of war, still it presents an increase, and also that the increaso in all the three years has been to a great extent on British shipping, and only very slight on foreign shippingIt is not a little remarkable that the large amount of tonnage taken up by the Government during the* comprising an aggregate of about 200.000 tons, should hava fallen back for employment upon the ordinary demands o- trade -without any peroeptible embarrmssment to the shipping interest, and this is another proof of the elasticity of the demand and the rapidity with which the country has adapted itself to the change from war to peaco. There is only one other point to which I iish to advert, end my object in doing so is to prove the demand for labour which now exists in this country, and which has not been diminished even by the disbanding of the troops and seamen after the war. The total number of emigrants from the united kingdom in tne year
1S52 was 368,764, and in the last year, 1856, it was i 176,554, showing the great reduction which has taken place in the emigration of the country since 1852, niotwithstanding the transition from war to peace. I shall now proceed to call the attention to something which may, perhaps, appear of more pressing interest-I mean the estimatee, or accounts of the actual expenditure which has been
caused bY the war, and of the manner in which that expen- I diture has been or wili be incurred. The expenditure of the three years of war, 1854-5, 1855-6, 1856-7, inclnding the loan of 2,000,0001. to Sardinia, was 228,721,0001. ; while the net expenditure of the three years 1831-2, 1852-3, 1853-4, immediately preceding the war, was 152,323,0001 If you deduct the expenditure of the three years of peace from that of the three years of war you must arrive at a pretty close approximation of the expenditure for the war. I do not know a fairer way of coming at it. This gives us 76,398,0001. as the war expenditure in the three years 18545, 1855-6, and 18567. The net revenue of the three years of war-that is to say, the revenue arising from the ordinary branches of taxation, independent of loans, was 192,685,0001., and if you deduct from that the not peace expenditure in the three years 1851-2, 1852-3, 1853.4, which was 152,323,0001., there remains a surplus revenue applicable to war expenditure amounting to 40,362,0001. That represents the war revenue derived from war taxation. Then I add the money raised by additions to the funded and unfunded debt, amoanting to 41,041,0001, Adding these two sums together, the total Bum applicable to war expenditure over and above the sum applied to peace expenditure would be found to be 81,403,0001. BIat as the excess of war expenditure was not more than 76,398,0001., the difference between those sums exhibits the more tl4riahing state of the revenue at the end of the war as compared with its state at the begianing, and shows that a pottlon of the money borrowed for the purpose of war still remains in the Exchequer. (EHear, hear,) I now proceed to a more practical part of the subjeot-namely, the estimated expenditure for the ensuing year (1857-8). (Eear, hear.) The interest of the funded and unfunded debt will bo 28,550,0001., and the permanent charges on the consolidated fund will amount to 1,770,0001. The charge for the army, including 400,0001. for the militia (the estimate of which is not on the table, though that will be the probable amount), will be 11,625,0001.; the charge for the navy, including the Coastguard, 8,109,0001. The packet service will cost '65,0001., and the civil services 7,250,0001. The collection of the revenue, which is now brought into the annual charge, though it was formerly excluded from it, will amount to 4,215,0001. The superannuation of revenue departmlents, removed from the gross revenue by the act of last session, and now brought into the annual statement for the first time, will be 475,0001. For the Government portion of the expense of the Persian expedition, which will accrue before the lt of April next year, I take 265,0001. That is all I propose to ask for that purpose, the sam being calculated according to the agreement entered into with the East India Company, to the effect that the Exchequer should bear half the extraordinary expenses of the war. The total of these supply charges will be 32,904,0001., which added to the charge for the debt, and to the charges on the consolidated fund, wiU make a total expenditure of 63,224,0001., independent of the repayment of debts. I now come to that portion of the burden for the year which is consequent on the late wariamely, the repaymient of loans contracted during the war, and made chargeable on the revenue of an enisuing year. First of all there is the series of Exchequerhbonds issued in 1854, and payable on the 8th of May, 1857. They amount t, 2,000,0001., and I propose to move a formal resolution for the rePayment of those bonds. There is also the sinking fund for the second loan of 5,090,0001. contracted last year and made chargeable on the consolidated fond, which amounts o 250,0001. The amount of debt, therefore, repayable. partly by specific engagement under act of Parliament, and partly by distinct charge on the consolidated fund, which therefore it is incumbent on the Government to make pro. vision for, is 2,250,'J001. The total outlay to be provided for in the ensuing year will be 65,474,0001. The committee, however, should bear in mind that the estimated expendi. ture for the coming year includes an amount of nearly 5,000,000t. for the collection of the revenue, which was not included in the estimate in former years. (Hear, hear.) Now, I will lay before the committee as shortly as I can some explanation in refer ence to the charges of the, ensuing year. I labour under some disadvant3ge in this respect, inasmuch as the com. nlittco will probably expect to hear some explanation, however gel.-ral, of the sums which I estimate for the charges of tlhe army and inavy; and those estimates have not yet undergone any con.-;deration before the [louse. I do not know that I coald take a fairer view of the army and navy estimates than by cui!uparing them wvith the amount of the same estimates before the war. As compared with the reduced esti iiates of l!;st year, there is an absolute diminution In the ar;ny a,nd navy estimates of the present year, amounting to, about 17000,0001. The committee must of course he aware that however desirous the Governisent may be to brirg tie wvar establishment to a peace standard, tie change cannot be umade by magic. (Hear, hear.) It cannot be miade in a- insta st, as if by the stroke of a wand. and some timne must necessiarily be allowed to the departments to make those changes by which the transition can be effected. Therefore, in instituting a comparison with the three years of peace immediately before the w.var, I take a comparison which everybody must aimit to be fair, and which in fact bears rather hardly against the executive, because it is not possible at once to bring the army and navy down to the condition in which it stood immediately before tie War. (Hear, hear.) These are the amounts for the army, navy, and packet service for three years before the war. In 18.31 the estimate for the army was 8,953,0)J1. ; in 1S32,
,408,0001.; andin 1853, 10,113,000. The eitiniate for the army for the ersuing year is on the table, and will be foiud to be 11,625,0001. (Hear, hear.) The estinate for the navy in 1851. was 5,734,00lo. ; in 1852, 5,835,0091. ; and in 15.3, 6,2K.,0001. For the ensuing year the estimate, exclusive of the Co-stguard, which would disturb time comnparison if taken into rhe calculation, inasmach as tha transfer of that itemn to the navy estimates was only made last year, i-s 7. 23,000l. I think that the commmmittee on com, paring these estill0-es with the estimates voted for the three years iallnme,ii ttelv before the wvar will adlinit that no charge cmin be imore unfoulded than that made against the Gevernmemit, that they wished to perpetuate extravagant war esta,lNihuments ditring a time of peace, to alter the old constutmmwmonal system of the country, and by an enormons augmentation iof our military establishments to overawe the country and threaten the liberties of the people. To sucl- an extent did some of the assertions go which were made On tile first nr .,!mt of the session. (Hear. hear.) As the esitimmnate r ti,e packet service enters into the nav, estinlates, thtt onlll'ittec will see that not every charge in those emeti-'.f mtsri is neeJ4 r.r uilitarv or belligerent purposes The esti:mass fvo the foreign packet service in 1851 was Z`Q%OtZ., 1 I.s l. 2 it cas :,ioot, and in 185:3, SS5,000C. It lins incre(,; c^1 thi- year to !y;.,O(JO. Now, the foreign packet venice, though 'f vr.:.:\ iimp srtance to the mercantile interest of this coo-stry, has m.othing to do with our military afftmrs. Vhenever tzhere is a question of the increase in the nu,mber of ships emiiployed in that service, or of a more fre. quent and rapid delivery of letters, the Treasury isurged by the strongest representations from various gentlereen engeged in foreign and domestic trade to increase the expendit- .re under that head, and is only restrained from g,in,g t,o,, far by a fear that the estimm,ates will be objected to by this House. The estimates for the armny and navy have not been consideredin acomamitteeof supply, and it may therefore be convenient that I should, without undertaking to anticipate the labours of my right hon. friend the i irst L.srd of the AILdmiralty, or of my hom. friend the tUnder Secretary of State for the War Department, briefly mention soine few of the causes which have led t) ari increase in them for the ensuing year over those for the year immediately preceding the war. In the navy estimates there has been 3a increase in the immarines and in the COastguard foIce. The increase in the latter force
was made in pars-:taice of an aot of Parliament passed last sessior, by which it was transferred from the department of tile Csi-toms to that of the Admiralty. The object of that acts -as to create a reserve naval f.rce. Those who were mo,-w qiuldified to form an opinion upon the subject approved the creationl of that force. Two gentlemen of great authority in this house, who have filled the office of Fn-st Lrd of the Adniiralty-vis., iyyright hon. friendsthe menmbers for Carlisle and Portsmsmouth, ssented to it, and it was more than assenred to by the opposite side of the HouseThe schemne was regarded as alegitimate and, upon the whole, an econonmical means of increasing our navy in a time of peace. It, however, led to increased expenditure, and part, therefore, of the ibcrease in the present navy estimates must be regarded as the result of the act of last session. The increased price of provisions, as compared with the years mmediately preceding the war, leads to some increase bo)t. the army and navy estimates. There is also an increase in the scientific vote for the navy. That surely cannot be regarded as likely to lead to results dangerous to our ltberties. Then there are contracts for timber, which were made during the war, which have not yet been fulfilled, but which will cause some additional expense during the ensuing year. Tho committee mnst be well aware that, as it was impossible to foregee the termaination of the war, it was necessary that the Government should provide for its possible continanca ; and therefore, while the war was raging, the Governrment had to enter into contrats upon t;he assuemption that it might last for somsyears. Peace being bappily concluded, the (Uovremoeul must either allow
thoFe contracts to be fulfilled or pay a forfeit. Either of these courses will entail some expense. There is an increase in the item of steam maohinery for the screw fleet, and also in the item of coals, in consequence of the progressive introdiaction of steam in the navy. That, I fear, mnst be considered as a permanent charge in the navy estimates, inasmuch as navigation by steam is itself more expensiva than navigation by sails. There is also an increased charge for the erection of naval factories for the re. pair of machinery and of large steamers; and like. wise for the enlargement of docks, basins, and slips to meet the increased size of ships. The result is, that, including the Coastguard force, there are inthe present navy estimates an increased charge for manning and victuaUing amounting to 450,0001., an increased charge for stores amounting to about 400,0001., for works abou: 300,0001., for dockyards200,ool., for miscellaneous 30,0001., making altogether a sum of 1,380,0001., which is the increase above the estimates for 1852. And now with regard to the army estimates, about which hon. gentlemeni, no doubt, entertained the greatest apprehensions of the designs of the Government. Leaving out the miUltia, the army estimates for 1853.4 amounted to 9,592,0001. ; those for the ensuing year amounted to 11,225,0001., showing an increase of 1,633,QOI. Now, this is the explanation of the principal source of the increase. In the first place there is an in. crease in the number of men. It is there, if anywhere that the dangerous designs of the Government must be dis covered. The number of men, exclusive of Qaeen's regiments in India, was 119,881 in 1853, but it will this year be 126,796, being an increase of 6,915 men. That increase ii principally owing to auggmentations of the artillery corps (hear, hear), and to the creation of two new corps-ths Military Train, or Land Transport, &nd the Hospital Corps, which is a body of orderlies to attend to the military patients of the hospitals. This explanation ought, I think, to relieve the Government from the charge that they are anxious to introduce, during the present transition from war to peace, an entire innovation in our military system. There is an item of 225,0001. for warlike stores, which is owing to the purchase of the new pattern musket and the fulfilment of contracts for gunpowder entered into during the war, and with regard to which the same remark as that which I have already made as to the contracts for timber applies. Gunpowder is an article which cannot be obtained in a moment. It is necessary that the manufacturers should have some notice before it is required. If the war had continued, and the Government had been found not to have made the necessiry provisions for obtaining such an article as gunpowder, I have no doubt that they would have received the well-merited censure of this House. The war being fortunately at an end a loss must be sustained on that article. There is an increase of 240,O0l. in the item with respect to artificers' wages on account of additions to the manufacturing depOt. That is owing to additions to the manufacturing departments. Under the head of works and buildings there is an increase of 243,0001., which is owing to the increased barrack accommodation which has been provided for the army (hear), and to the great military hospital at Southampton and works of defence in progress upon the coast. There is also another increase in the educational vote of G7,0001. These are the principal items of increase in the army estimates. (Cheers.) I now come to the civil service estimates, in which likewise there is an increase. The amount of these estimates is 7,250,0001., which exhibits an increase of about half a million over the e3timate for the current year. There are, as the miscellaneous estimates vill inform the House, aug. mentations under certain heads and diminutions under others which may be set off against each other, but the general result is an increase of about half a million, which is accoumted for in the following manner -There is an entirely new charge for the County Courts, now for the first time brought into the estimates, in consequence of an acm passed during the last session. That biUl was received with great favour in this house, and there was manifested by many gentlemen a disposition still further to increase the charge. (Hear, hear.) This charge for the County Courts, which was previously defrayed by fees, will amount to lS0,0001. There is also a charge for county constabulary-no doubt a most useful expenditure, but one to which a similar observation applies-viz., that it was proposed in this House that the sum granted from the Exchequer for that purpose shonld be increased. The sum estimated for the county constabulary is 146,0001. There will be an increase in the amount of the vote for public education in England, arising from the extension of the operations of the Committee of Council, an extension which I hope will not be other than acceptable to a large majority of the memnbers of this House, who appear to think that it is in this manner that assistance can best be given to voluntary efforts for the improvement and extension of education. (Hear, hear.) The addition to this vote will be 129,0001. (Hear, hear.) I shall also propose to take a vote for purchasing a site on which to build certain public offices, a matter which has now become one of necessity. I shall ask for money sufficient for the purchaso of land on which to build a new Foreign-office-an office for the War Department, which is now scattered under different roofs, and a newr Colonial-office. The amount which I shall require will be 80,0001. These four items, taken together, make the sum of 535,0001., and therefore I have fully accounted for the increase of half a million in the civil service estimates, the chief part of which arises from two new charges which are now for the first time brought upon the votes of this House-viz., those for County Courts aud county constabulary. There will aiso be an increase in the charges for the collection of revenue amounting to 111,0001. That is, I believe, principally owing to the increased facilities which have been given for th- transmission of letters and the consequent auginenta. tion of the charge for the Post-office. Having thus caUed the attention of the committee to some items of the miseellaneous estimates, I must be permitted to refer with some feeling to a remark which was made by my right hon. friend the member for the University of Oxford (Mr. Gladstone) on the first night of the session. He said that he had observed both in the country and in this house a disposition to increase expenditure and to diminish taxation. Now, Sir, it was remarked, I think, by Dr. Johnson, that it rarely happens that more than one-half of an antithetical sentence is true; but I can confirm to the very letter the exact truth of my right hon. friend's antithesis. I can from personal experience bear witness to the fact that there is at pi esent a very great desire to increase expenditure-a desire not less strong than that which appears to prevail for the reduction of taxation. Well, Sir, we hear a good deal of complaints-made sosnetimes in this house, but more frequently at public meetings in the country and through the medium of the press-of the jobbing tendencies of Governments, of public men, and even of the members of I his House; and it is affirmed that the great causo of the increase of expenditure and of the demands made upon the niational Exchequer is this tendency to corruption. It seems to me that the gentlemen who smake these complaints take their opinions of the existing state of things from books such as Horace Walpole's Memoirs, Doddinmgton's Diary, or other well-known historical works of the last century; but fail to observe facts and events passing under their eyes. There is no real danger of the Exchequer suffering to any serious extent from jobbery or corruption. (A slight laugh.) That is my firt belief. However I may suffer a loss Of tle good opinion of hon. gentlemen for my supposed innocence and siwplicity (renewed laughter), I must nevertheless venture to reassert ssy opinion that, looking at the publicity which surrounds public men, looking at the discussions which take place in this house, and at the vigilance of public opinion and of the press, the Exchequer of this countrv is in no great danger from personal jobbing and corruption. (Hear, hear.) The real danger to the Exchequer comies from a totally different quarter. it arises from the usoful projects and the ardent philanthropy of various persons, each intent upon realizing his own plan for the good of the country. (Hear, hear.) I speak with some feeling upon this subject, inasmuch as it is my lot to receive a great variety of representations either from deputations or in writing, the larger proportion of
which are prompted by tbe best motives and aim at the most useful objects, but all of which it would be impossible to Watisfy if the taxes of this country amounted, not to
60,000,0001., but to 120,000,0001. a-year. No moderats anmount of taxation would be sufficient to provide for all the useful objects which are suggested. It is not long
-ince an application was made to me for the advance of 4.0B,0001. to the Metropolitan Board of Works. (Laughter.) Eon. gentlemen may treat the matter with levity, but I
can assure them that that is by no means the spirit in which it is regarded by the gentlemen who made the application to me. They were extremely unwilling to receive the answer which I gave them, that the matter should receive the consideration of the Government (renewed laughter), and seemed to be surprised that I did not at once enter-I presume on behalf of Parliament-into an engagement ts
effect a loan to the extent of 4,000,0001. for the object which they have in view, I merely mention that as an object in which a very large portion of the population of this
metropolis takes an iutertet, and which maLny persons con-
sider to be a national object of no ordinary importance. There is also a plan which was recommended by a committee of last session for the concentration of aul the Dublic offices. That committee recommended that there should be a large purchase of land in West- inster,-intenin g, I presume, that public offices should, without loes of time, be erocted
upon it. I believe that the lowest estimate for the purchase of the land was about 1,50,0001. ("hear, hear," and a
-tas was renewed at--the same rate by the Government of Lord Derby, but it was renewed for only a year in con. sequence of the peculiar position of that Government, which did not allov them to propose any important renewal or change of taxation. I now come to 1833. In that year the income-tax was fixed at 7d. in the pound for two years fromn the 5th of April, 1853; at 6d. in the pound for two years from the 5th of April, 1805; and at 5d. for thres years from the 5th of April 1S57; so that if the wrar had not intervened the tax now current would have been 6d. in the pound, and for th-ee years from the 5th of April, 1857, it would have been 5d. in the pound. Therefore, what is ealled " the war ninepence" is in fact the difference between the tax as it stood at the commencement of the war and the lax as it stands at present. By the same act of 1853 the income-tax was extended to Ireland, and it was also extendtd to incomes above 1001. and less than 1501. at 5d. in the pound. 1'he war now supervened, and the result was that the income-tax did not fall from 7d. to 6d. ; on the contrary, in 1S54 it was increased from 7d. to 14d. and from 5d. to lOd. in the pound-that is to say, it was raised to 14d. on incomes above 1501., and to IOd. on incomes between 1501. and 1001. At the same timne it was continued at those rates till the 6th of April next after the ratification of a treaty of peace. Bat in 1855 the tax was increased to 16d. and 11d.-in other words, 2d. was added to the 14d. aun I3d. to the 10d. It was continued during the war "and until"-these are the words upon which so many commenus have been made-" the 6th of April which shall first happen after the expiration of one year from the ratification of a definitive treaty of Peace." That, Sir, is the present state of the income-tax. For the present year it btands at ls. 4d. in the pound upon 'ncomes above 1501, and at 11id. upon incomes between 1501. and 1001., and it is continued, by the operation of the words which I have read, for another year, commencing on the 7th of April next. It would fal for the following two years to 5d. in the pound, and then altogether expire. That is the legal position of the income-tax. It has been supposed that there was some design or reason on the part of the Government for making a distinction between the income-tax and the duties on tea, sugar, and coffee. I can assure the committee that the difference in the wording of the acts was not at aU the result of design; it was the result of a mere accident, and owes its existence to a singular coincidence of dates, which it was impossible for the Covernment to foresee when the acts were passed. According to the act passed in 1854 the present rates of the income-tax were to continue until the 6th of April next after the ratification of the treaty of peace. Consequently, if the treaty had been ratified on the 5th of April, the tax would have ceased a day after the ratification. The committee must bes aware from the tatement I have already made that war expenditure does not cease with active hostilities, but that it is necessary for the Govern. ment to be provided with funds, or else to appeal to Parliament to meet that expenditure which, though not falling within the period of hostilities, fairly and properly belongs to the time of war. Therefore, in raising the income-tax the words which I have read were inserted in the act. It was intended to levy the tax at the increased rates during the remainder of the financial year, whatever that remainder might be, in which the treaty of peace might be ratified, and for one clear year beyond that pedod. The word " ratification" of a treaty of peace occurred in a former income-tax act, and was transferred to the act of 1854, but it did not occur in the Customs and Excise Act. In that act the words used were, that the duties on tea, sugar, and coffee should continue during the war, "and until the 5th of April inclusive which shall first happen after the end of 12 months from the date of a definitive treaty of peace with Russia." Instead of using the word " ratification" as in the Income-tax Act, the word " date" was inserted in the Customs and Excise Act. That difference of expresdon arose from an inadvertence, not from design. It so happened, however, that the treaty of peace was signed on the 30th of March, but the ratifications were not exchaDged tin the 7th of April, and therefore the 5th of April, the day mentioned in the Castoms and Excise Act, intervened between the signature and the ratification of the treaty-an event altogether impossible to foresee. I have endeavoured to ascertain what is the exact import of the phrase, " the date of a treaty," and have been informed that, properly speaking, it means the date of the signature, and not the date of the ratification; although the treaty takes effect only from the latter period. Owing, therefore, to this accidental difference in the language of the two acts, it was held that the additional duties on tea, sugar, and coffee would expire on the 5th of April next, whereas the inco0ne. tax would last for another year. Sucla is the simple explanation of a subject which has occupied so much of the attention of the country. I will only add that although, in answer to a queAtion put to me by the hon. and learned member for WaUingford, I stated what was the legal effect of the accidental and undesigned phraseology of the Incometax Act, I never for a moment entertained the idea of asking the House to continue the tax longer than the exigencies of the public service would require it. (Hear, hear.) Well, Sir, as the law stands at present the sum which the Exchequer would be entitled to receive from the income-tax would be 16d. for the ensuing year, and 5d. for each of the two following years; that is to say, it would be entitled to receive 26d., each of which may be tak-en as represent. )ng 1,000,0001. sterling. Consequently, the total sum payable under the Income-tax Act is 26,000,000l. The proposal which I have to make to the Committee, looking to the increased charges upon the revenue for some years to come owing to the debts contracted during the war, and to the remission of taxation in the same period, is to fix the in. come-tax as it was originaUy fixed by Sir Robert Peel, and at two subsequent periods, taking it for the next three years at 7d. in the pound. (This announcement was received with some cheering, which was speedily converted into roars of laughter when a large number of hon. members, on both sides rose from their seats and left the house. The noise occasioned by their withdrawal having subsided the right hon. gentleman, who had joined in the merriment, proceeded with his statement.) I am sorry, Sir, to have to continue my explanation to an audience so greatly reduced in numbers (a laugh); nevertheless, I must state to those who remain what will be the effect of the proposed alteration. The number of millions to which the Exchequer would be entitled under the existing law is 26, distributed over the next three years. The effect of the change which I propose will be that the Exchequer will receive 21,000,0001., being a diminution of 5,000,000l., spread over the same period. Another effect wil be that more than a-half of the tax; wiU be remitted in the ensuing year, for, whereas the present rate of the tax is 16d. in thi pound, I propose to reduce it to 7d. Sixteen pence in the pound is equal to 61. 13s. 4d. per cent.; 7d. in the pound to 21. 1Ss. 4d. ; and 5d. to 2. ls. Sd. The difference, therefore, between the rate at which I propose to fix the tax and the rate at which it would stand for the next two years, if no alteration were made, is only 16s. 8d. per cent., 5d. being equal to 21. Is. Sd. per cent. The committee will thus see that, while the relief granted in the ensuing year wiU be great and sensible, the additional charge intho two following 3 ears will not be such as to be injuriously felt by the country. The relief will not be confined to the class of incomes exceeding 1501. a-year. I propose to reduce the rate of incometax levied upon incomes between 1001. and 1501. a-year to the rate adopted in the original measure of my right hon. friend,-namely, 5d. in the pouand, which will amount to 21, Is. Sd. per cent. I believe the high war income-tax has pressed with great severity upon the class of small incomes, and I think I can explain why that has been the case. My right hon. friend, in proposing this extension of the tax expressed an opinion that he would not, as he phrased it, " trench upon the territory of labour," for he thought that by limiting the tax to amounts exceeding 1001. it would not affect any considerable number of persons in receipt of weekly wages. I am unable to obtain a very exact account of the number of persons receiving weekly wages who are contributors to the income-tax; but I have reason
to beleve that it is not less than 20,000. Persons in receipt of 21. a-week are liable to the tax, and the sum of 41. 1s. 10d. per annum, payable half-yearly, must have been extremely burdensome to individuals in such a position. (Hear, hear.) The tax would become still more burdensome if it fell into arrear, and if a person receiving only 21. a-week was called upon to pay at once 41. isa lOd.,-more than double his weekly earnings. The effect of the change I propose wil be that a persoa receiving 21. a-week win only be liable to an income-tax of 21. is. Sd. per annum, which is about 11. half-yearly,. and therefore the reduction will afford great relief to the possessors of small incomes, and must have the effect of diminishing tho objec tions felt in many quarters to this part of the tax. There ie, however, another war tax with which I shall propose to deal, but with regard to which I cannot pursue the course I have suggested in the case of the income-tax-I allude to tho duty upon tea and sugar. The duty upon tea is for the present year Is. 9d. per lb., and by the existing law it would fall to ls. 2d. on the Ist of April next, and to Is. for the next and succeeding years. The duties on sugar are also arranged upon a similar plan of reduction. It happens that at this moment the stock of sugar is -ery low, and it cannot therefore be expected that a
reduction in tho price of that article consequent upon the
diminution of the duty would be attended with any great increase of consumption. The aame remark applieg to tea, inasmuch as recent event at CantoA have imposed obstacles to futurs exportations. With regard, therefore, to both these articles it cannot be expected that a considerable reduction of duty would be followed by any material increase of oonsumptisiux tel course of t'he ext year. The dimination I
1 preposein the rate of the income-tix will lead to a great re-
duction of the revenue, not so much in the present year as in the two succeeding years. The difference between a tax
f 7d. in the pound and one of 16d. would involve a diminution of revenue to the amountof 9,009,0001., which would leave a deficient income as compared with the probable expenditure of the country. I therefore intend to propose a new scale for the reduction of the duties upon tea and sugAr, rendering the diminution somewhat blower than it would be nuider the existing law, and thus providing for a more gradual diminution of the revenue. I will state what are the duties I propose to adopt :-The duty on tea now stands at Is. 9d. per lb. I propose thab for the next year, 1S57-8, it shaU be Is. 7d.; for 1858-9.
Is. 5d.; for 1859-60, ls. 3d., and that from that period it shad be Is. The present duty on refined sugar is 20s. per cwt. I propose that next year it shall faU to 1Ss. 4d. ; in the following year to lGs. Sd.; in 1859 to 15s., and in subsequent years to 13s. 4d. The duty on brown sugar is now 13s. Od., and I propose that in 1857 it shall be 12s. 8d.; in 1858, lis. Sd.; in 1859-60, 10s. 7d., and that after thaperiod it shall be 9s. 6d. The duty on yellow sugar is at present 15s., and I propose that it shall be 13s. 10d. in 1857, 12s. 9d. in 1858, lls. 8d. in 1859, and subsequently 10s. 6d. I will now state to the committee the estimated revenve for the ensuing year. I estimate the Castoms at 22,850,0001., the Excise at 17,000,0001., the stamps at 7,450,0001., the land and assessed taxes at 3,150,0001., and the income-tax at 11,450,0001. The consmittee must recollect, however, that, owing to arrears whicai are still due, a considerable amount of the high rate of income-tax will be receivable in the present year, and the full effect of the reduction will not be felt until the year ensuing. I estimate thatthe Post-office waill yield 3,00,0004, the Crown-lands 265,0001., and miscellaneous items 1,200,0001., making a total of 66,365,000. The total ex. renditure and discharge of liabilities I estimate at 65,474,000l., and there will thus be a probable surplus of 891,000!., which is not more than it wil be pruden' to reserve for the contingent expenditure of the year. The total amount of taxation which I propose to take off in the present year wiU be found in the following table .- . "Malttax, loss in 1857-8 (in addition to 200,000!. ia 1856-7) 2,000,0001. ; income-tax (to be reduced to 7d. and 5d.), 9,125,000!. ; tea (to be reduced from 1s. 9d. to Is. 7d. per lb.), 369,0001.; coffee (to be reduced from 4d. to 3d. per lb.), 133,0001.; sugar (to be reduced from an averave of 14s. 4d. to 13s. 4d.), 3D,0001. ; total reduction, 11,971,0301." Of this total of 11.971,0001., about 7,600,009L wiiU be a do. duction from the Exchequer receipts for the ensuing year, 1857-8. If the committee should adopt the plan which I have proposed I believe that sufficient revenue will be provided to meet the liabilities of the Exchequer for the payment of tho bonds due in the three years commencing from the 1st of April, for the extinction of the war sinldng fand, aud also for the payment of the increased interest on the debt, leaving some margin for any slight increase in the army, navy, or civil service estimates, beyond the amount at which they now stand. If the liabilities created by the 40,000,000!. of debtcontracted duringtthe war should bedischargedacoording to the plan which has been laid do n by Parliament, and accordingto that which Iam nowproposing for the next three years, andif further accruing liabilities should be metbyacorresponding provision, I calculate that the entire debt createI by the war will have been extinguished by the year 1877More than half of the extraordinary expenditure of tho war 'Was defrayed from taxation, the remaining half by loans; and this portion, as I have just said, if the arrangement I propose is adopted, will be extingoished in about 20 years. It seems to me that such a state of things affords a favourable retrospect of the arrangements made during this war. (Hear, hear.) It shows the greater providence of the present generation, and if our ancestors had treated us as well as we are about to treat posterity we should not at the present time be loaded with the burden of a debt of 809,000,000!. (Hear, hear.) I am afraid I have detained the committee at an unreasonable length, but they must be aware that in the discharge of important duties such as that which I have just attempted to discharge it is important that every material fact bearing upon the question at issue should be laid before those with whom the decision rests, and I would rather incur the charge of tediousness and prolixity than fail to submit to the consideration of the committee any matters which may be necessary or useful to guide their judgments. (Hear, hear.) -I do not believe that I have troubled them with anything which is immaterial to the matters under consideration. With regard to the plan which I have proposed, being, as I know it is, dictated by publiec motives, and being intended to conduce to the general welfare of the country, I do not doubt that it will receive a dispassionate and impartial consideration, and that hon. gentlemen will form their judgment upoII it, not wvith any reference to the side of the house on which they sit, but with more enlarged views, and with a sense of the responsibility under which we labour in making a provision so important for the fature happiness and prosperity of the community. (Hear, hear.) The right hon. gentleman (having spoken about two hours and three-quarters) concluded by moving that a sum not exceeding 2,000,000!. be granted to Her Majesty to meet the payments due on account of Excbequer-bonds.
The CHIAIRAN having put tho question,
Mr. GL&DSTO1E said,-I am aware that it is the usual practice to abstain from discussing in detail the various propositions of the budget on the night on which it is brought forward, and, considering the comprehensive nature of the statement which my right hon. friend has made, and the gravity of much of the matter which it eontains, I have never known an occasion on which it would be more inexpedient to depart from that rule. I have no intention, therefore, of making any remarks upon the important questions which arise out of miy right hon. friend's speech. My only object in rising now is to ask him one or two questions as to matters of fact, and also to express a hope that, as the resolution which he has just moved seems to form a portion of the policy of the budget, ho will not ask us to give a vote upon it to-night. It does not refer to the execution of any contract immediately pending; but is does form part of the policy which this House wiiU have to decide upon, and, therefore, before taking any vote upon it, time ought to be given to allow of a calm and in uartial consideration of his whole schenme. (Hear.) When my rght hon. friend spoke of the sum of 150.000!. as being the loss consequent upon the change in the law respecting bills of exchange, I presume that before charging that loss he took credit for the proceeds of the stamps on foreign bills of exchange. My right hon. friend spoke of the loss of 2S5, 000!. upon assessed taxes in the year 1854-5, as a loss which was to be reckoned in the light of an addition to the remissions since 1853. In answer to that I beg to assure my right hon. friend that that loss was distinctly included in the calculationsof 1853, and was before tho House when those proposals were made. I wish, al;o, to ask my right hon. friend a question with respect to the table whiuch he has given us of the proposed relief to conisunsers. He spoke of a loss of 2,000,0001. on the malt-tax as included in his proposal, but, if I nnderstand rightly the state of the law, that loss of 2,000,0001. doesnotdepend upon any proposal of his, but is one of the consequences of the law as it now stands, and therefore dues not form part of any loss which we are going to infliot uponi the revenue, or of any relief which we are going to give to the consumer. My right hon. friend also spoke of a loss upon tea, coffee, and sugar; but, if I understand the state of the case rightly, as regards tea and sugar, lhe is not going to lose money, but to gain it-that is, he is going to impose upon those articles a duty, lower certainly than thst which is leviable at the present moment, bat higher than that which would be leviable aftor ti e 5th of April xext according to the present law, and therefore it is not a question of granting relief from taxation uponxtea and sugar, but it is, as far as it goes, a question of increasing the rates ef duties payable upon those commodities. If that be so, I think it would be for our convenience if my right hon. friend, having stated the case one way-having shown the loss which will be sustained in the reduction from the war rate of duties-would supply us with figures showing the gain he expects to realize from his new duties as compared with those which would take effect under the present law. I confess I should like to know the calculations of my right hon. friend on these points. They comprise matters merely of fat- all discussion upon the case I propose to reserve. It wonid be therefore convenient, as well as, I think, in accordance vwith usage, not to takie a vote upon the resolution to-night.
(ker.)
Mr. ALCOCK was glad to find that the Chancellor of thb Exchequer had not been induced by any alarm as to what had taken place either out of doors or in this house to propose a reduction of the tax on incomes beyond the point ho
ad stated to-night. He (llr. Alcock) confessed ho was one of those who were in favour of direct taxation, who thought well of the Liverpool Financial Association, and who believed that if that association could have its way to a certain extent in regard to the finances of this country very great benefit would result. The Liverpool Association asserted that the national incomo was 650,000,0001. a-year. Now, a tax of 10l er ocent. upon this sum vwould preduce 65,000,000!., and this would allow of the entire aolition of all other taxation. Probably there was some exaggeration inx that calculation, but no one could doubt that the income of the country could not be less than* between 500,000,0001. and 600,000,000!. If this question could be decidod by working men, he thought they would be in favour of the taxation of all incomes from the lowest to the highest, so that they oould be exempt from indirect taxation. With regard to the tea duty,
he was astonished to hear that the Chancellor of the Excheqaer was not going to mate a greater Teduction. lAst year the consumption of tea was onlv two pounds per head throughout thi kingdom, whilei n the flourishingcolony of Victoria the consumption was 10 pounds. With much a difference as this,could anyone doubt that it would be for the advantage of working mes to pay Income-tax, provided they could be free from taxes upon the necessaries of life? He was also astonished that the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed to do nothing with regard to the fire insuneooduty. In Phnoe, it woMla be remembered, seven-eighths of all the property wa
inmred aginst fire, whie in England only one-third
'was so insured. Wag anything wanted to show nore clearly the operation of the Government dut,y ? Recurring to the income-tax, he thought it a great pity that the Chancellar of tleExohequerdidnot ge greater facilityfor appeals against the rate of asssment. Lt tem depend upon it,
the unpopulmrity of the tax was in a great measure owing. to the harsh and dictatorial manner in which appeals were
treated in the different courts throughout the country. He j thought, too, that the Government ought to provide against the defalcations Of collectors. In some cases parishes had to pay two or three times over in consequence of these defal. cations, and he considered the Government ought to appoint these persons, seethatthey provided proper security, and take the responsibilhy as to their conduct. Another poiut to which he wished to call Attention was the tax on dogs. A te w
ears ago this duty was raised from Ss. to 12s.-a rate which edto a vast deal of fr.aud throughout the country by people who evaded the tax, and which in other cases operated as a great grievance upon poor people, who lived, perhaps, in solitary parts of the country, and who were taxed, while the sheep dogs of farmers were exempt.
Sir H. WILLOUGHBY said he should follow the sugoestion of the right hon. gentleman opposite and abstain rom any discussion of the details involved in the statement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. lIe was niore iuclined to do this because the two main points of the right non. gentleman's proposals,-namely, the material reduction of the estimnates and the abolition of the war incometax-met with his perfect approval. There was one point, however, to which he wished to call attention. On a former occasion. he had asked whether the 2,000,0001. furnished to Sardinia really was a loan or not, and, if so, when and in what manner it was to be paid. He thought it only right that the House should have a clear understanding on this subject The estimate of 265,0001. for the Persian war appeared to him to be a very low estimate, and he should be obliged to the right hon. 4entleman if he would inforns the House upon what basis it was made.
Mr. WARNER had not quite understood frorn the right hon. gentlerman how he proposed to raise the whole amount which was calculated for the public expendi'ure, for the different taxea which had been named by him hardly amounted to C5,000,0001.; but he believed that the scheme Proposed would give general satisfaction. He should he glad to hear what the right hon. gentleman proposed to do with the income-tax after the three years had expired when the tax ought to cease, and whether it was tobe regarded as forming part of the general system of taxation, or as an extraordinary tax. lf it was tobe regarded as the latter, the people of tnas country would submit to it for particular purposes; hut, if the former, it would give rise to great agitation and cause considerable ill-feeling against the Government of the
Mr. W. VILLIAMS thanked the right hon. gentleman for the able and intelligible manner in which he had laid his financial plans before the House. There was one point, however, upon which he could express no satisfactios, and that was the estimated expenditure of the year, 'which exceeded that of any year from the termination of the French to the commencement of the Russian war. He would beg to call the attention of the House to the expenditure proposed by various Prime ainisters during that period. In the year 1830, when the Duke of Wellington was Prime Minister, the gross expenditure 'was 13,000,0001. less than that proposed for next year, while the estimate for the army and navy was 5,160,0001. Iess. In 1833, when Lord Grey was Prime ainister, the gross expenditure was 15,000,0001. less, and that for the army and navy 6,400,0001. less than that which was now
roposed. In 1834, under the Preniership of Lord Melcourne, the estimate for the army and navy was 6,984,0001. less, and the gross expenditure 15,200,0001. less. Under Sir R. Peel the whole expenditure was 16.600,0001., and the estimate for the army and navy 7,390,0001. less. In 1850, with Lord John Russell as Prime Ilinister, the estisnate for the army and navy was less by 3,660,0001., and the gross expenditure by 10,500,C001. ; and in the time of Lord Aberdeen's Governmentthe total expenditure was 10,500,0001. less. It was time that the House of Commons should inquire the reason for that increased expenditure. As regarded the incometax, if the Chancelor of the Exchequer had reduced the expenditure to What it was in 1852, he would possibly have been able to get rid of it altogether, or, at aU events, to reduce it to 5d. The inJury which the present tax inflicted upon persons whose income was less than 1501. a-year was almost incredible, and at a future period he should feel it his duty to propose that the tax should not extend to incomes less than 1501. a-year.
Sir F. BARING wished to know whether the 2,000,0001. spoken of by the right hon. gentleman (the Chancellor of the Exchequer) as the loss upon malt was exclusive of the 800,0001. repayment for drawback and 200,0001. loss upon the duty spoken of in anotherpartof the speech.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.-Yes. The total loss in two years is 3,000,0001.
Mr. BLACKBURN said he had understood the right hon. gentleman to say that the total expenditure for the year was 65o500,000l. in round numbers, including 2.000,0001. of Exchequer-bonds to be paid off this year, and the total income 66,500,0001. In a previous part of his statement the right hon. gentleman stated the cost of the war to have been 76,000,0001., of which 40,000,0001. had been paid by taxes, and 36,000,0001. had been met by loans. The amount that had been raised by loans was 41,000,0001., and thus it appeared there was a balance of 5,000,0001. in hand, and if that had beer included in the income as the 2,000,0001. of Exchequer-bonds had been in the expenditure the total income would be 71,500,0001.
Mr. COCHRANE wished to call attention to one point, The Chancellor of the Exchequer had dwelt much upon an opinion which he supposed to prevail in the country, to the effect that a great deal of corruption occurred in some deprtments Ele (31r. Cochrane) did not a"ree with the ight hon. gentleman upon that point, but would remind the House of a speech made by the hen, member for Sheffield thIr. Roebuck) at Liverpool n few weeks since, in which
"What I know to be the fact vwl not now long exist. I know, Sir, that the realy honest, distingaished men in the House refused to have anything to do with the Government contracts, because they are obliged to preface proceedings by bribing the department. I am not now speaking irl a whisper; what I am now saying the gentlemen below me wil tell to all England. I am as suro of this as of mny own existence that, from the very top to the bottom of the standing departments-the permanent departments of this country-there is corruption and foul dealing."
Thus, in a speech made by a membrr of that House the departments of the Government were positively charged with corruption and foul dealing, and it was not surprisin that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should have alluded to the feelings which such a charge might be supposed to have excited in the public mind. With regard to the statement of the right hon. gentleman generally, he (Mr. Cochrane) was glad to find that what might be called the spasmodic action of the income-tax had been terminated.
Mr. HADFIELD thought it would have been fairer to his hon. and learned colleague if the hon. member for Lanarkshire (Mr. Cochrane) had either given notice of his intention to comment upon a speech delivered by him at Liverpool, or that he should have done so while the hon. and learned member was in the house. He (Mr. Hadfield) would venturetosaythis,- bis hon. colleaguewould beatany time prepared to acceptany challenge that might be givenim reference to his expression of opinions upon public affairs. Passing to a more importantsubject-the financial statement of the right hon. gentleman, he (Mr. Hadfield) could not belp regretting that while engaged in untaxing themselves they had done so little for the workig classes. Then,again,he regretted to find that nothing was to be done in respect to the tax upon fire insurances, which was a tax upon providence at once impolitic and unjust. He believed that if the right hon. gentleman were to reduce the tax to onethird more revenue would be realized by it. Thero was another tax which deserved the attention of the Chancellor of the Exchequer with a view to its reduction, and that 'was the tax on passenger traffic in railways, which amounted to about 10 or 12 per cent. on the net receipts. HIe trusted that some relief would be extended to the pablic hi respect to both the taxes he had referred to.
Mir. COCHRANE, in explanation, observed thje could not give the hon. and learned member for SheffieId notice of the observations he had made to the House, becaume they arose out of some remarks which had fallen fromr the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the course of his speech that night.
Mr. H .STIE (Glasgow) said that the plan proposed by the ChanceUor of the Exchequer for the reduction of tea duties would prove more disadvantageous to the revenue and obstructive to the trade than if the duty were lowered and at once made equal over the tbree years. When there was a drop in a duty at certain periods, trade in the article usualy ceased sometime before each drop occurred. In other respects he thought the statement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer satisfactory.
Mr. MURROUGH said that a'war tax had never been resigned more ungracefully than on the present occasion. On fornmer occasions the income-tax had been abandoned when the necessity for which it was imposed had ceased, and he trusted that some hon. member would be found bold and honest enough to propose the total repeal of the present income-tax.
Mr. PHIfLIPPS adverted to the succession duty. He said thst there was one provision which, in some circumstances, operated unnustly, by making the person who sqc-
ceeded o 'property pay, not according to the relation in which he stood to the person he succeeded, but according to that person's relation to the original settlor. If the Chancellor of the Exchequer should have any available s:rplus he (Mr. Poilipps) recommended that it should be applied to the relie. of those parties upon whom the succession duty pressed with undue seveAity.
Mr. W. EWART, while admitting that the income-tax could not be maintained, thought it would be hiecessary to retain a property-tax iu some shape to relieve our commerce &ad manufactures, and enable them to compete with those of other nations.
Sir S. BIGNOLD was not aware of any general call having been made for the remission of the duties on fire
snauruce, and he therefore hoped that the Chancelor of tha Excm equer would not remuit them, if by so doing he should at aU endanger the total abolion of the income-tax
Mr. VINCE believed that the financial statements would 'e received with great dissatisfaction by the mercantile and umanufacturing classes. There was no such thin.' as free trade in this country. He had that day purchased a publication lately issued cealled 27ce Briti&1s IZ!usiff, by which he found that a vast number of the xmanufactured articles of this country were still subjected to very heavt duties by foreign countries, while their articles inight be I-perted into thim country free of duty. He called at the offioe of the French consul that day for the purpose of asking him what was the present stAte of the duties imposed by Franoe on the importation of British articles of commerce. Thatgentlenan informed him that the inuporta, tion of cotton. silk, anid woollen manufactures was either entirely pr ihibited, or subjected to a duty so high as to be tantamount to prohibition. He(mr. Vaneol traded with America, and found that the importation of British mannfacture, into that country was subj-cted to duties ranging frou 20 to :30 per ceut. That wax the reciprocity 'which we had got for oar free trade. (Hear, he.r.) There was one
branch ci -L n . .,i'res-vir, the boot and shoe trade -which was wii -.,, nmnmensely from conupetition with French boo,ts m,i -'e,which were imported Into this
country at very I , we. di
Mr. DUNCAN hlAieeed, notwithstanding what had beau said by the hon. mezuber for Norwich, that there was a very general desire for the reduction of the duties on fire insurance. He concurred withthe hon. memberforGlsgow in thinking that the decreased duty on tea and sugar ought to be spread over the year.
Mr. I LACIK thought that the duty ou paper ought to bh abolished (laughter); but he would not say that it ought to be removed before other duties were touched. He looked upon the incomie-tax as one of the worat taxes that could be imposed upon a people, because it was inquisitorial and produced great itmmorality, inasmuch as many persons gave way to the temptation to make dishonest returns of their inconie.
In reply to Mr. DISTIAELT,
The CHA YCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said it was not his intention to press his resolution that evening.
Mr. DISRAELI hoped, therefore, that the House would well con8ider the financial statement, so far as regarded the income-tax, before theresolution was again discussed.
Mr. OLIVEIRA believed that if acommitteewere granted him he should he able to show that the produce of wine last year in many districts was very large. The large interests involved and the commercial intercourse betwveen this country and Portuigal and Spain ought to be broughtfairly befo)re the -louse, and he hoped to have an opportunity of directing attention to the subject.
Mr. WILSON said, that with regard to the sugar and tea duties hon. gentleoen would find that the objections which they urged were inore applicable to the plan they suggested than to that of his right hon. friend. Every reduction of customs or excise duties that was known beforehand disturbed the article in question in anticipation of that re. duction, but it was found that the disturbance in the market was exactly in proportion to the size of the reduction. If the reduction was large people withheld their purchases for a considerable period beforehand at great inconvenience to themselves. But if the reduction were snaUl and were made from time to time the motive for withholding purchases and the disturbance of trade were not so great. It had been found by practice in reducing, the sugar duties from 259. to lOs., that in proportion as the reduction was gradual and small from year to year the inconvenience to the trade was the least felt. As the law now stood, half the war rate came off on the 5th of April next, and the other balf on the 5th of April in the succeeding year. The on,ly difference tetween the p resent regulation and the proposal of the ChanceeUor of the Exchequer was that the. duty, instead of coming dowin 2?. at twice, would come off at four times, the reduction being lt. each year.
Mr. T. BARIING said, that the hon. gentleman who had just sat down spoke as if the Government were about to aecord a favour and were about to reduce the duty on sugar, when there was really to be an increase of duty, and when the holders of sugar and tea were about to be deluded to a certain extent by the Gevernment, because they had passed an act declaring that the sugar duties after a certain period were to drop at a certain rate, and now they proposed to levy an additional duty. (Hear, hear.) The hon. gentleman might talk about givng ease to the trade, but the Eroposal of the Government was rather hard upon the
aolders. (Hear,hear.)
Mr. WILSON had treated the question as between a sudden drop three years hence and a more gradual diminution. The question was not as to the reduction, but as to the mere mode of making the reduction.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.-It is not my intention to press my resolution upon the House tonight, as somehon. gentlemen wish for further time for its consideration. Bnt before the discussion closes I wish to answer one or two of the questions put to me. 'rhe hon. baronet the member for Evesham (Sir H. Willoughby) asked whether the Sardinian loan was a real loan, and whether the interest was regularly paid by the Sardinian Government? The answer I have to make is, that the arrangement with the Sardinian Government was, that the interest at 3 per cent. and a sinking fund of 1 per cent. should be annuaUy paid. Since this arrangement was made the payments due have been made with perfect regularity. (Hear, hear.) There is therefore no complaint that can be made against the good faith of the Sardinian Government, and there is, no doubt, on their part every inteintion of preserving that good faith in future. The advance has, in fact, aU the attributes of a loan. The hon. baronet also inquired as to the course intended to be adopted with respect to tho Persian war. The statement I made was that the estimate for the expenses of the Persian war up to April 1 would be, as far s related to the extraordinary expenses, divided between the Government and the East India Company. But the House have been informed that negotiations are pending with the Persian Minister at Paris, and, so far as the information of the Government extends, we hope that those negotiations may be reasonably expected to lead to a satisfactory adjust. mant of the difficulty at issue with Persia. (Hear, hear.) At aU events, we are not entitled to assuame that the war will be continued for a year from the Ist of April next, All that -we can do is to ask for a vote during this session for covering that portion of the expenditure of the East India Company which will be due before the let of April next year. I was also asked a question with respect to that portion of the debt incurred during the war which was not applied to the service of the war, and which is now in the Exchequer. The hon. gentleman seems to think that this balanoe might be brought in aid of the service of the coming year. What I gave was the estimate of the receipts and expenditure of the coming year. With respect to the balances in the Exchequer at the commencemnent of the year, that is a separate account, and can only be compared with the correeponding balance of last year. There is of course always a large num in the eleventh rnonth out of which are payable the dividends of the year. My right hon. friend the member for Portsmouth (Sir F. T. Baring) asks me to lay on the table a return of the liabilities of the cointry with respect to the interest of the debt in future yoars. I have that account in a distinct form, and I wlll lay it on the table. I have also been asked a question relative to the malt duty. During the present yearon the 5th of July-the war malt duty ceased. There is a long credit given for malt and, with regard to malt, the loss will be 200,0001. tis year, but there is also lost the repaynient of the drawback on the stock in hand, which is about 800,0001., so that the actual loss is 1,000,0001. Next year the reduction of the war duty wiU be felt, and the loss next year, compared with the total amount of war duty on malt, wil be 2,000,0001. I do not propose to trespass upon the House at greater length. I thank the House for their indulgence (hear, hear), and I do not propose now to caU upon them so early to express a definite opinion uipon the statement I have submitted to them. A questionl has been asked me by the right hon. gentleman the member for the University of Oxford, but as my right hon. friend is not here I shaU reserve my answer until M`onday, when we shall resume the debate on this resolution. I shall then ask the House to come to a vote on the resolution. (Hear.)
The CHAIRMA.N reported progress, and obtained leave to sit again on Monday.
The House then resumed.
The Ionian SubjecW Commissions Bill was read a second time.
PASSING TOLLS BILL.
Mr. LOWE moved that this bill be read a second time.
Mr. T. BARING said he did not rise to oppose the bill, but to make a few observations upon the statement made by the right hon. gentlenian in moving for leave to introI dice it with respect to Ramsgate harbour. The right
hon. gentleman stated that Ramagate harbour had cost 2,000, 001. ; that its cost had been defrayed out of Government money, and that this was an improvident use of Government money; moreover, that the expenses of the harbour amiounted to 20,000?. per annm, and that they might, in his opinion, be reduced to 7,5001. if the harbour were placed under the management of the Board of Trade. He was sure that the right hon. gentleman had no wilsh to convey an erroneous impression to the House in order to promote the success of his own measure, but he felt it to be his duty, on the part of the harbour trustees, to correct the inaccuracies of the right hon. gentleman's statement. The sunm of 2,000,uO)u. could not properly be called expenditure upon the harbour, because it was the total anmount which had been expended since 1748, not onlyupon the harbour, but upon every branch of its management, and upon all the arrangements connected with it. He thought the statement that this 2,000,0001. was Government money was also calculatedtomisleadthepublic. Ithadbeenobtainedfrom the passing tolls which were granted by act of Parliament to the harbour commission, and pledged by the trustees when money was wanted by them. Not a penny had been received from the consolidated fund or from Government. The annual expenditure for the last six years bad been 17,5001,, and that sum included not merely the cost of the
3management of theharbour, but some very heavy incidental I expenses, such as those of repairing and building the walls of the harbour. If the right hon. gentleman would undertake to defray all those expenses for the sum of 7,5001. the trusteei would be happy to allow him to make the attempt, He was sure that the right hon. gentleman would not hesitate, after this statement, to acknowledge the errors into which he had fallen.
Mr. DEEDE3 wished to inform the Houce of 'be cirouns. stances under which this somewhat extraordinary bill had been introduced. Any one who looRed at its title wfithout examining its detaUs would hardly suppose that it dealt with the rights of persons who had exercised those rights under the authority of acts of Parliament for a long series of years. The title was insufficient; it ought to have been called " A biU for the abolition of passing tolls, and for the levying of taxes or charges in certain cases." This was not the rst time the bill had been broughtbeforethe House. Four years ngo a bill directed against the same interests was introduced by the Admiiralty, aud the House declared that it was a direct attack upon private property, that notices ought to have been served upon the persons interested, and that it must go to the Examiner of Bills and the StandiDg Orders Committee, and take its chance. What was the result? T'he examiner reported that the standing orders had not been complied 'with, the committee, notwithstanding that it was a Governnient biUl, reported that the standing orders ought not to be asispended in its favour, and the bill was lost. liubeequently thbt identical bill wa-as embodied in a larger bill, and again introduced, bhut notices -,re then served, and the persons interested petitioned to be heard by counsel before a Sect comn,ittee, and the bill was accordingly sent toa select comU.itteC, but in consequence of the early close of the sssion the petitioners had no opportunity of naking out their case. The bill had nOw been introduced a third time, but no notices bad been served, and he believed it was the opinion of the Speaker tha t notices were not necessary, inasmuch as the hill applied to harboura in different parts of the kingduomj, and was one of a public cbaracter.
laugh), and I suppose that for the erection of buildings in accordance with the views of those who promoted this plan a sum of not less than 5,000,0001. or 6,000,0001. sterling would be required. There are numerous plans for museums, for collections of science and art,-all of them highly useful and tending to the improvement of aU classes of the comr munity,-not confined to London, but proposed for Edinburgh and Dublin, and even for other large towns in the united kingdom. There are plans for the laying otit of parks in the metropolis and other large towns (I neeo not say that the purchase in the neighbourhood of London of a space sufficient for a public park implies a considerable outlay of money), and also a plan for the purchase of Hampstead-heath. There are numerous plans for widening the streets and improving the approaches and communication' of the metropolis. There are plans connected with bridges in the metropolis and elsewhere. There are plans for electric telegraphs connecting the most distant regions of the earth, passing, however, under thousands of miles of soa. There aTe also nnmerous and undoubtedly most beneficial plans for the extension of education, and for the erec. tion of schools of different sorts and for different classes. Furthermore, there are aLl those plans and proposals, of which we used to hear so much last session, for the increase of half-pay and superannuation allowances, and for allowances to widows and other persons who have suffered from the consequences of the war. I dare say that the experience of hon. members would easily enable them to increase this list. But it is from proposals of this kind, and not from proposals for the benefit of individuals or for purposes of corruption, that the real difficulties of the Government arise at the present time; inasmuch as it is utterly impossible, however wealthy the country may be, however willing to submit to any reasonable load of taxation, for it to provide the funds required for all these different projects; and therefore the task of selecting those of them which are the most useful, the most urgent, and most deserving of the attention of the Govermment and of this House is anything but an easy one. Let me now recaLl the consideration of the committee to the debt which has been created by the war, and which has imposed obligations on the nation which it is now necessary to fulfil. The total addition made to the funded debt during the war was 30,265,0001., involving an increased annual charge of 907,000, . There were also terminable annuities granted to the extent of 116,0001. Next, ther were Exchequer-bonds issued to the extent of 7,000,0001.; also Exchequer-bils to the extent of 5,041,0001., bearing an annual interest of 191,0001. The annual charge on the Exchequer-bonds ii 245,0001. The annual increase of charge upon the revenue c n account of the debt created during the war, exclusive of esrtain items to which I shall presently refer, amounts therefore, in round numbers to a million and a-half sterling' I have now completed the explanation which I have to offer en the subject of the expenditure; but before I come to the plan of taxation for the ensuing year I must trouble the committee with some remarks upon expressions that fell from my right hon. friend the member for the University of Oxford on a former night. I am not quite sure that I fully collected the purport of his observations, but I remembet that he alluded to a compact entered into in the year 1853 between Parliament and the country with regard to the permanence of the financial Arrangements of that session. Now, I can understand an agreement such as that made at the time of the union between Scotland and England, or at the time of the union between Ireland and England, and embodied in an act of Parliament, by which one of the contracting parties may be said to ba extinguished;-I can understand an arrangement of that kind having the sacred nature of a contract, which can. not be disturbed without a manifest breach of public faith. But, in order to establish the doctrine that a financial arrangement entered into for a particular year or series of years has the qualities and incidents of a compact. it is necessary, it seems to me, to show that the state of things which was assumed as the basis of that compact has not been varied by subsequent events, but still remains unchanged. In the first place, then, the plan of 1853 was framed on the supposition that peace would continue unbroken. I need not say that that part of the supposition unfortunately did not prove to be correct. War, in its actual expenditure, as well as in its consequences, is unhappily a disturbing cause in the matter of finance of the first magnitude; and it is only necessary for me to refer to the facts which I have just narrated in regard to the large increase of annual charge on account of the debt, owing to the recent hostilities, in order to show that the foundation of the arrangement of 1853 has, in the most important respect, been overturned. Yet not only has the annual charge of the debt been augmented, but there are also certain pay. ments in the nature of the redemption of debt which take effect in the years included within the period of that settlement. The settlement extended from 1853 to 1860. Well, according to the obligations fixed by acts of Parliament now in force, there are Exchequer-bonds to the extent of 2,000,0001., which become payable in 1857; an equal amount is also payable in 1858; an equal amount likewise in 1859; and a further sum of 1,000,0001. in 1860. In additionto this there is a sinking fund for was loans, for which the charge on the consolidated fund in 1857 wiiU amount to 250,0001. ; in 1858 to 1,500,000l.; and in each of the two following years the sum will also be 1,500,0001.; making for the four years between 1857 and 1860 the foUowing total amounts:2,250,000!. for 1857, 3,500,000l. for 1858, 3,500,000 for 1859, and 2,500,000!. for 1860. Besides these repayments in the nature of a sinking fund, there is also, as I have said, an additional sum for interest of 1,460,0001. in 1857, 1,360,0001. in 1858, and 1,220,0001. in 1859. Now this series of obligations in the shape of annual interest and repayments of the principal of the debt has, unfortunately,
disturbed the settlement entered into in 1853-a settlement which had every prospect of a satisfactory issue if we had remained at peace, but the basis of which was altogether deranged by the stern reality of subsequent events. Since the year 1853 not only has a large additional charge in the way of interest on debt and repayment of the principal been imposed on the resources of the coantry for the next four years, but during the same interval large remissions of taxation have been made, materially diminishing the public rovenue. So that, while we have increased our expenditure, we have concurrently lost part of our income. In 1854 an alteration was made in the duty on bins of exchange, by which a reduction of 150,0001. was effected. In the same year there was a diminution of 290,000!. in the produce of the assessed taxes. In the following year an annual sum of 260,0001. was sacrificed by the abolition of the newspaper stamp duty, after maldug due allowance for the increased receipts derived by the Post-office in consequence of that remission. In 1855 another remission which was much pressed on the Government, and had many advocates on both sides of the House, was made by the Government in compliance with the general wish expressed on the subject. I allude to the reduction of the duty upon stage carriages, involving a loss of 60,0061. per annum to tho revenue. The total amount, therefore, of the remissions of taxation made since 1853 is 760,0001. I conceive, then, that the hands of this House are perfectly free to deal with this question at the present time, and that Parliament cannot deem itself in any way tied up by an arrangement made on an assumption, which I wished as sincerely as any one had been supported by the result, but which was unhappily falsified by the subsequent course of events. I now come, Sir, or rather I approach more closely (cheers) to the arrangemonts of taxation for the ensuing year, and I will trouble the House with some explanation on the sub.ecl of directand indirecttaxation, uponwhichthosearrangements mainly turn. (Laughter). I thing there is an exaggerated idea as to the amount of direct taxation which is now levied upon the country. The current of feeling runs strongly, as it seems to me, against any form of direct taxes. (Opposition cheers.) Such a feeling appears to be expressed in many quarters. One mode of trying the justice of that feeling is to examine what are the relative amounts levied by direct and indirectAtaxation. I think this is an important matter,
bearing in a most direct and practical manner on the solu- j
tion of the question which is about to engage the attention of the House. (Hear, hear.) The amount of those taxes which constructively bear the name of direct taxes is not large, if we put out of view the war income-tax. The war income-tax is no doubt principally owing to the exigency of circumstances; but, that being put out of consideration, and reverting to the income tax as it was originally imposed by Sir R. Peel, the House must, I think, be of opinion that the amount of direct taxes, strictly so called, is by no means considerable. I have divided the taxation of the country into three classes. I have taken first those direct taxes which are paid at fixed periods-that class of taxes to which alone French financiers give the name of direct taxes. They do not give the name of direct taxes to those taxes which seem to me to deserve the name, though they are not paid at stated and fixed periods. The land-tax produces 1,150,0001., the assessed taxes 2,000,0001., the income-tax 7,100,000!.; making altogether 10,250,000!. That is the total amount of the direct taxation of this
country where taxes are paid at fixed periods, aSnsming the rate of income-tax to be as it existed before the war. There is also another class of taxes, which, although direct taxes in point of incidence, are not complained of as being oppressive, inasmuch as they are not paid in the same compulsory manner, or at sated periods, but according to the wants of the taxpayer. There is no doubt, however, they are direct taxes, and fall in direct incidence on property. The whole revenue from stamps, probate, egacy, and sucoession duties is 7,450,0001. With regard to the sae-
cession duty, it seems tome, Zeatmisnnderstandingprevaia. I have heard it stated thAt the succession duty ia a hea'ry burden on lauded property, that it tends to the confia$ion
of the estates of landowners (cheers from the Opposition), that it forms a great and material increase to the direct taxation of the country, and that it may be considered almost as another income-tax. (Renewed Opposition cheers.) The present amount of the succession duty is about 500,0001. a-year. It is anticipated that, increasing by slow degrees, it will rise to maturity about 1863, and it is estimated that it will then produce 1,200,0001. a-year. Another tax undoubtedly direct in its incidence is postage. (Cries of "INo !") Well; it must be enumerated among direct taxes, but it is a tax for which every persoa gets an equivalent, and a very safficient equivalent (hear, hear); and therefore I only enumerate it among this class of taxes for the sake of completeness. Postage Produces 3,000,0001. The second class of direct taxes gives this result:-Stamps, probate, legacy, and succession duties, 7,450,0001.; postage, 3,000,0DO0.-making together, 10,450,0001. The total of these two classes of direct taxes is 20,700,000. The total of the indirect taxes -namely, Castoms and Excise, is 39,850, 0001., and therefore the indirect taxes ara about double the amoant of the direct taxet, assuming the income-tax at its original amount, and allowing 3,000,0oot. for postage. I regret to have to troubl5 the House with many of these statements, butI needscarcely Say this is a material fact, bearing on the question before us as to the relative magnitade of the direct and indirect taxes of the country. (Cheers.) There are some gentlemen who, notwithstanding the general desire to diminish direct taxes, and especially to remove the war rate of the income-tax, say that they would wish to keep up the income and other direct taxes to a considerable amount, for the purpose of reducing certain indirect taxes, pressing, as they think, with great severity on the trade and industrv of the country. One of these is the paper duty, and I receied, not many days ago, a deputation headed by the right hon. gentleman the member for Manchester, who pressed on the consideration of the Government the reduction of that duty. The duty falls on three classes of paper-namely, paper used for printing, paper used for writing, and paper used for packing-and being charged, not according to value, but according to weight, financially speaking the burden is by far the heaviest on the large quantity which is used for the purpose of packing.
instead of being more oppressive on that class of paper which leads my right hon. friend to denominate it a tax on l,nowledge, it falls more heavily on the two other descrip. tions. But, with regard to packing and writing papers, I confess I do not see that those descriptions, in the present state of our revenue and expenditure, are not proper subjects of taxation. (Cheers from the Opposition.) With regard to paper used for the purpose of printing, we must consider not merely the demands of the manufacturer, but what will be the probable advantage to the consumer. I confess, having carefuUy considered the subject, I do not believe that the total abolition of the paper duty would produce to the ordinary purchaser of books and newspapersanyappreciableadvantage.(CheersfromtheOppositiuo.) Therefore, Sir, withoutat aU denying the claims of the paper duty being considered at a time when our expenditure may be less and our revenue may be greater, I cannot admit that at the present moment it is a proper subject for reduction. (Hear, hear.) There is another article the duty on which some persons wish to see diminished. The hon. member for Pontefract (Mr. Oliveira) has given notice of a motion for a committee to inquire with a view to a reduction of the duty on wine. (Laughter.) I do not think it at present necessary to go into that subject. From accidental and natural causes the production of wine has undergone a great diminution. The exports of spirits from this country have increased in consequence. Instead of the continent being enabled to give us a redundant supply of wine, we are exporting spirits to supply their demands. This would not, therefore, be a happy moment for the trial of an experiment which I am sure my hon. friend himself must regard as somewhat perilous. (Cheers.) There is only one other duty to which I will refer. It is one which interested many gentlemen last session, and which was brought forward for discussion in this HouseImean the duty on fire insurance. I have lately laid upon the table a report upon this subject. I have caused it to be carefuly investigated during the recess, and you wil find in that report the materials for arriving at a judgment on the question, which did not exist in an authentic and official form before. The result of a careful consideration of the question has been to conviace me that it is a duty which fals exclusively upon reahzed property, for which reason it ought to receive the support of those gentlemen who g ish to transfer all taxation to realized property-that it is a duty which adapts itself with singular felicity to the circumstances of the taxpayer, which is heaviest when the insurance is lightest, and lightest whea the insurance is heaviest, and which has advanced in its contribution to the revenue with a steady progression for a great number of years. I confess thatIcanLsee no groundwhatever foracceding to the propositions which have been made for the reduction of that duty, and, so far as I am able to judge, I believe it to be one of the last duties which ought to be relinquished. (Murmurs from behind the Ministerial benches.) I aun sorry to differ from hon. gentlemen upon this subject, but I must ask them to suspend their judgment until they have had an opportunity of reading the report to which I have referred, in which the matter is treated at great length, and with great candour and ability. (Cheers.) At all events, if the conclusion at which I have arrived be distasteful to hon. members behind me, 1 assure them that I have only come to it after a careful consideration of the subject, and I think that they can hardly-at aU events, for the presentpress for the abolition of the duty on fire insurances. In dealing with the taxation of the coming year I shaU propose, therefore, to confine myself to those taxes which were imposed daring the war, and I shall not make any modifications of any other portion of our taxation than that which underwent revision duringthe war. In proposing the modifications which I am about to do I would bear in mind the dictum of a writer whose opinion I think should command some authorityin this house-a writerwho is in no degree obnoxious to the chargeof being a speculator or a theorist, but who is a practical man, conversant with various branches of economy, and particularly of agricultural economy-I mean Arthur Young, whose travels in England, Ireland, and France are doubtless wellU known to nembers of this HFouse. After pointing outvwhat are in his opinion the principal attributes which a system of taxation ought to possess, and dweling especiaUy apon the importance of equality, he makes the foUowing observations:-
" The mere circunistanceof taxes being very numerous, in e,rder to raise a given sum, is a considerable step towards equality in the burden faiing on the people; if I was to define a good system of taxation it should be that of bearing lightly on an infinite number of points, heavily on none. In other words, that simplicity in taxation is the greatest additional weight that can be given to taxes, and ought in every country to be most sedulously avoided."
Now, Sir, that opinion, though contrary to much that we hear at the present day, seems to me to be fnU of wisdom. and to be a most muef l praetical guide in the arrangemen' of a system of taxa6tion. I wil now go through the war taxes, to which I think it necessary to caU the attention of the committee. In the first place there is the dutyonspirits, *n which a permanent increase was laid during the war. snd which nr.y be reckoned on as producing a permanent addition to the revenue of about 1,500,0001. a-year. It was imposed as a permanent tax, and it does not cease upon the termination of the war. I think that the committoo will agree with me that spirits are legitimate objects of taxation at a time when a large revenue is required, subject to the condition that the rate of duty does not lead to iUicit distillation. (Hear, hear.) lllicit distillation is so great an evil, and it so demorahzes the country in which it prevails by producing lawless habits, that any amount of revenue is dearly purchased at the cost of promoting illicit distillatlon. IIitherto, however, it has not been found that the present rate of duty either in Ireland or Scotland has led to iUicit distillation. I can assure the committee that this is a subject to which I am quite alive, and so long as I have the honour to hold lmy present office, it is one which I shall most cara. fully watch with a view to discover any increase in its practice; but while matters remain in their present position I
see no reason for proposing any alteration in the spirit duties. (FIear, hear.) The next duty to which I must advert is the duty upon malt. Last year there was a los; upon malt to the amount of 200,0001. The duty ceased upon the 5th of -July last, but on account of the long credit given a portion of the war daty became payable last year. In the ensuing year the entire effect of the remission of the war duty upon malt wiUl be experienced, and it will occasion a loss of about 2,000,0001. The additional war duty is now removed. I now come to the income-tax (cheers), and I wiU first in. form the committee of the present position of that tax. It was imposed for the purpose of revenue in 1842, at the rate of 7d. in the pound upon incomes above 150. a-year, for three years It was renewed in 1845, and again in 1848, for two triennial periods, at the same rate. It therefore continued for nine years, being renewed at triennial periods, at the rate of 7d. in the pound on all incomes above 1501. a-year,--incomes below that amount being exempted. In 1851 a similar renewal at the same rate and for the same period was propoed by my right hon. friend the present First Lord of the Admiralty, but it met with a good deal of opposition on the ground of the mode of assemsment, and, in deferance to the prevalent opinion of the House, it was renewed only for one year, and a select committee was appointed to inquire into the mode of aassesment. I oughbt to state that my noble friend the member for the citY of London, who was then at the head of the Government, while he asented to the appointment of the oommittee, objeoted to so large a portion of the revenue being made to decend uLpon an annual act. In 1852 the income-
But he also understood that the right hon. gentleman (the Speaker) held that the character of the biUl with re=&rd to
lamsgate was such that it ought to be submitted to the ordeal of a select committee. He had mentioned this to the right hon. gentleman the Vice-President of the Board of Trade (fr. Lowe), and had informed him that after the bill had been read a second time he (Mr. Deedes) should move that it should be referred to & select committee, which, following the precedent of the Smithfield Market BAil, should consist of nine members tobenominated by the Committeeof Selection, and that tho parties petitioning should havepower to appear by their counsel, agents, and witnesses. If this course were adopted he should be unwilling to occupy the attention of the House; but he must say that he thought it was contrary to all recent principles of taxatioa that the Board of Trade should be allowed to tax the inhabitants of Raisgate by means of a toll levied upon al cargoes landed in that port to the tune or about two thousand and some odd hundreds a-year, in order to maintain this harbour. It was said that Rassgate would be nothing rwithout the harbour; hut why should not Ramasgate 'dourish as well as Brighton, where there was no harbour of refuge?
Mr. JAMES M'GREGOR said that the case of Sandwich harbour was harder than that of Ramegate, because in that instance there was a question of the redemption of a debt contracted by the commissioners.
Mr. W. S. LINDSAY said that, although he should cheerfully bow to the decision of the Speaker, he thought it would be a great hardship to the shipping interest that this bill should be referred to a select committee. The subject had been so fully discussed that it was impossible any fresh information should be obtained. This tax was upon the face of it grossly unjust. It amounted to about 32,0001., and not only did not one out of 20 of the ships which paid these tolls derive any benefit from these harbours, but he really believed that more skips were lost In endeavouring to make these so-called harbours of refuge than were ever saved by the shelter which they afforded
Mr. LOWE said he had hoped that, before he replied to the hon. members who addressed the House, they would have been favoured with the opinion of the Speaker, but he supposed it was more in order that the expression of that opinion should be reserved until the bill had been read a second time, and it became a question what should be done with it in its subsequent stages. In reply to the hon. member for Huntingdon (Mr. T. Baring) he would state that he never intended to give any offence or to cause any annoyance to the trustees of Ramsgate harbour. If he had said that any money spent upon the harbour had come out of the consolidated fund he was certainly wrong. The money so expended was, however, to a certain extent, public money, because it had for the last 108 years been levied by tolls upon the shipping interest. It 'was an enormous sum, and there was but little to show for it, but he did not believe that that was ia any measure the fault of the trustees. So faras he could make it out, the trustees had spent about 10,0001., which was the sumu he stated the other evening. The Government wva told that by close economy the harbour could be managed for 7,5001 per annum; but, whether that were so or not, he did not intend to make it any reproach against the trustees-than whom he believed no men could have actedc with a more single and entire view to the pubhc service-that they had spent 10,0001t a- year, He could not, however, admit that there was any hardship in the case, because the harbour was constructed and the tax imposed for the benefit, not of Ramsgate, but of the shipping interest, which, it appeared, was now anxious that this tax, originally imposed for itsbenefit, should cease. What the hon. gentleman (Mr. Deedes) had said as to the injustice of taxing the people of Ramegate referred to the provision to be made for the maintenance of the harbour. that provision was simply this :-A certain amount of pro.
rty wthich had been realized by the passing tolls was to pplied to this purpose, and there were, besides, certain taxes levied in the harbour, the proceeds of which it was likewise intended to devote to its maintenance and repair. There was a toll which was levied by the paving commissioners upon aU coals landed in the harbour, and the pro. ceeds of this were applied to municipal purposes; and the consolidated fund would also be called upon for a contribution. It would, however, be !moustrous that public funds should be applied to the maintenance of this harbour, and at the same time the corporation of Ramsgate should be allowed to tax goods brought into it for their own benefit. He did not tbink that the ChanceUor of the Exchequer could with any face ask the House to vote the public money for Ramsgato harbour while the corporation of that place levied a tax upon coals for municipal purposes. Let him turn next to the hon. member for Sandwich (Mr. James I'Gregor). That hon. gentleman, followirg the track marked out for him by the petition which he had presented, had misled the House as to the true state of the case. The hon. member alleged, as did also the petition, that owing to the injury done to Sandwich haven by the erection of Ramsgate harbour, the former town was entitled to a payment of 200z. -year from the Ramsgate passing tolls. That, however, was not the fact. The hon. gentleman was very a*ixious the other night that he should give him an opinion on a case stated by himself- and ho (Mr. Lowe) was very glad that he hbd not done so, because the case was not a correct one. The Ramsgate passing toUs were imposed in consequence of a committee of that House. which sat in 1749, and took evidence on the subject. Witnesses from Sandwich were examined, one of whom was prevailed upon to say that the hayen there had been choked up by the construction of Ramsgate harbour. But it also then came out that the place was in the course of being gradually silted up, and that the water was sballower by one foot than it had been 20 years before. Moreover, it was notorious that the meeting of the tides from the North Sea and the Channel formed the Goodwin Sands, and caused the silting up of the harbours on the south-eastern coast-a process which had been going on for very many years, He had also the authority of Sir J. Rennie for saying that no practical or appreciable difference was produced on Sandwich haven by liamsgate-barbour; so that even if the 2001. had been granted in consideration of the probable silting uo of this haven as the effect of the formation of Ramsgate arbour, the anticipation would not have been realized, and the process must have been the same in any case. But unfortunately for the hon. gentleman this was not the fact. To the evidence adduced before it the committee attached no weight. The act of Parliament, the 22d of George II., under which the 2001. was claimed, placed the grant entirely on a general ground, and not on the special ground now adroitly put forward. [The right hon. gentleman, in support of his assertion, here quoted the recital of the act, in which it was stated, as a reason for nialin the grant of 200, a-year, that the improvements to be maie in ziandwioh haven "would greatly benefit the trade and navigation of the kingdom."] There was not a word there as to the effect of Rasusgato harbour,; but the people of Sandwich wanted money to deepo their haven and prevent its being filled up by the soilage brought thither by the sea ; end, being no doubt ably represented then, as at present, in that house, they deemed it an excellent opportunity to get the committee to put in a " small trifle" for themselves. It was notoeven pretended that the haven was a harbour of refuge-the thing was obtained by a very simple and easilv understood job. The hon. gentleman said this bifl made no provision for the payment of the debt contracted on the security of the grant. That was certainly an oversight, which, if the bill went into committee, should be carefully remedied. The creditors no doubt had a right to be protected, and he was obliged to the hon. member for reminding him of this omission. So much, then, for the alleged cruel hardship sought to be indficted on the borough of Sandwich. Efe had only to add that he should bosw to the decision of the Speaker on the technical point that had been raised in the discussion.
The SPEAKZER was understood to observe that bodies or individuals whose interests were affected by the measure would be entitled, according to the rules and practice of he Hous, to bo heard before the select committee. The second reading was then agreed to,
MIr. DEEDES moved that the bill be referred to a committee of ninue members to be uominated by the Committee of Selection, and that parties petitioning against the measure be heard by counsel before the committee.
Mr. JAMES M'GREGOR would undertake to procure the opinions of eminent engineers, proving that Sandwich haven had been injured by the construction of Ramsgate harbour. The borough of Sandwich was now as much entitled to consideration at the hands of Parliament as it wras in 1749; and he maintained, however much it might expose him to the aneers of the Vice-President of the Board of Trade, that he was doing his duty towards the trade of the kingdom by endeavouring to protect Sandwich from the spoiation which the right hon. gentleman was aboat to perpetrate when a grave omission was pointed out to him in his bil that had resulted from his own neglect of duty.
The motion was then agreed to.

London, Saturday, February 14, 1857.
LONDON, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1857.
In the House of Lords last night,
The Earl of DErB?Y gave notice that he should bring forward a motion on the hostilities with China as soon as the papers connected with the subject were laid on the table.
The Marquis of CLANRICARDE called the attention of the Government to the arrears which existed in the Encumbered Estates Court in Ireland, and wished to know when the vacancy, caused by the retirement of Baron RICUARDS, would be supplied?
The LORD CH,LNLCFLLOR replied that tlhe vacancy whica had been created in the Encu nbered Estates Couit wrould be shortly filled up.
Lord BRort'AoH moved a series of resolutions relating to the property of married women, the coIIsideration of which after some discussion was adjourned for six weeks, on the motion of Lord CA.MLPBEIL, it being uuderstood that Lord BROUount
would be absent from England during that space of time,
Some other business was then despatched, after which their Lordships adjourned.
The House of Commons, after various questions had been put and answered, which gave rise to a short debate, with reference to the hosti'dties with Persia, having resolved it,elf into a Committee of Sapply,
The CHAN?ELLOR of the ExCHERQUER made his financial stat,nment, premising that this wvas the first occasion on which it was competent to hita to make it. He began by calling attention to the revenue and expenditure of the current financial year, 1856-57. In the statement he made last year he estinated the revenue of the current year at 7,1,740,0001. ; its actual amount had been somewhat greater-namely, 71,SS;,0001. The expenditure for 1850-57, including the loan to Sardinia of 1,000,0001. and the vote of credit of 2,000,0001., he had estimated at 82,113,0001., showing, therefore, a deficiency of 10,373,0001. in the estimated revenue, or, deductiug the margin of 2,000,O00t., a deficiency of 8,373,00ul. In order to cover this deticiency certain loans were effected, which, with the issue of 1,000,0001. of Exchequer-bills, amounted to 7,499,0001. of borrowed money for the year. The powrer of borrowing money granted to the Government had been limited to 4,O),0(00., but it had been exercised only to the extent of 1,000,0001., and no further use would be made of that powver. ThLe total receipts from revenue, loans, and Exchequerbills in the year 1856-57 amounited to 79,3S4,oiO)0I. Theactual expenditurewould amount to 78,0ut,(001., leaving a balance of 1,384,0O0O1. The present year, Sir C. LEivIs proceeded to observe, was not a year of ordinary peace expenditure, bat a year of extraordinary expenditure; hesides certain extraordinary expenses, there would be a loss upon the malt revenue, owing to the expiration of the war duty and to drawbacks, amounting to about 1,000,0001., to be deducted from the revenue of the year in consequence of the peace. He then read statistical statements showing the vast increase in the exports, imports, and shipping of the country, demonstrating the eLasticity of its resources, and various calculations, affording an estimate of the expenditure cansed by the wrar, the reventie derived from w-ar taxation, aud the amnounit added since the war to our funded and unfunded debt. He next entered upon a coniideration of the estimated expenditure for the ensuing year, w-hich he calculated at 65,474,0001.-viz.:-
Interest upon Debt .... . £23,550,00 Charges upon Consolidated Fund 1,770,00T Army Eistimates (including
400,0001. for the Militia) .. 11,625,000 Navy Estimates ... ... 8,109,0)/ Packet Service ... ... ... 90o,000 Civil Services ... ... ... ,2050,000 Collection of the Revenue . 4,215,000 Superannuations ... ... .. 4753,000 Persian Expedition ... ... 265,000 flepayment of Debt *.. ... 2,200,000
Hfe then gave the details of the principal heads of charge for the present year, premiiising that, although the saving upon the Arrmy and Navy Estimates compared with those of the last year was already upwards of 17,000,0001., the change from a war to a peace andard could ot be made instan.ter; that sonic time must be allowed for the effect of the transition. After analyzin.S,he Eitimates, and explaining their details, he stated the amount of the debt created by the war, funded and unfunded, at 41,041,0001. Before he proceeded to expounld his plan of taxation for the ensuing year he adverted to the question of direct and indirect taxation, and stated the sums levied upon both species of imposts, which, he thought, bore in a practioal manner UpoIn the subject. The total of our direct taxation amaounited to 20,701,9001., and that of indirect taxation to 39,850,0001. ; so that the inidirect taxauion was nearly double the amonnt of the direet. Claims were mnade, he remarked, for remissiolns of indirect taxes. As to the duty on paper, after consiaering, the subject, lie did not believe, he said, that tht
total abolition of that duty w'v.. - ! d to purcbarers of books or newspaper. o1-! appreciable benefit, and he therefore thou;' Tt:'- cii;iiiis for a remission of this duty should be i -. un-til the public expenditure was less :It. :lie revenne greater. With respect to the dutb l i eins;irances, which fell exclusively upon real. roperty, be1ieving that a reduction of it would *t I.e reproductive, he saw no ground for accedinig I he proposi'tion for reducing this duty. He .- therefore conrine hlimself to the taxe- imposed or revised during the war. As to the duty on spirits, upon which a permanent duty vwas imposed during the war, yielding about 1,5003,000b., he believed the :House would agree that spirits were a legitimate -object of taxation, subject to the coindition that it should not lead to illicit distillation. He did not, therefore, see any reason for proposing an alteration in the duty on spirits. With respect to malt, the *cessation of the war duty would occasion a loss of 2,000,0001. upon this article. The n ext tax was that upon incomes. After reciting the history of this tax from the date of its irnposition, in 1842, and explaining its present rates, he -stated the circumstances under vhiclh the words "until the 5th of April next after the ratification of a treaty of peace," vwhich did not appear in the Customs and Excise acts, came to be inserted in the Income-tax Act, declaring that he never entertained an idea of asking tlle House on that ground to continue the tax beyond the exigency of the public service. Looking at the demands upon the revenue owing to the transition from war to tegce, to the debt and liabilities created during the war, and to the remission of taxation, he pro-posed to fix the income-tax at the original rate of 7d. in the pound, fixed by Sir R. PEEL, for three years, upon incomes a',ove 1501. a- year, and at 6d. in the pound upon incomes between 1001. and 1501. He proposed to deal in another way with the taxes upon tea and sugar, by -adopting a scale of reductions in each case different from that of the existing law, making the abatement slower, and therefore providing for a more -gradual diminution of revenue. The total revenue -for the ensuing year he estimated at (i6,365,0001., thich would leave a surplus over the expenditure -of 891,000!.-viz.:-
Customs ... ... .. £22,850,000 Excise ... ... ... ... 17,000,000 Stamps ... ... . 7,450,000 Land and Assessed Taxes ... 3,150,000 Income-tax ... ... ... 11,450,000 Post-office ... ... ... 3,000,000 Crown Lands ... ... .. 265,000 Miscellaiieous... ... ... 1,200,000
'The total amount of the taxes that would be reduced this year was 11,971,W01. In conclusion, he observed that if the liabilities of the next three years were discharged, and the accruing liabilities were met, the entire debt of 40,0()U,0001. owing to the war would be extinguished in 2i) years. He -moved a resolution for a vote of 2,000,0J01. to pay off and discharge Exchequer-bonds issued in 1854, and payable on the 8th of M;lay, 1857.
Mr. GLADSTONE said, considering the comprehensive nature of the statement made by the CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER, and the gravity of the matters it contained, it would be highly iniexpedient at that time to discuss the statement; but lie hoped the vote would not be taken that night, as it formed -a part of the policy of the Government.
After a short discussion, in the course of which various explanations were called for, and were given in the reply of thle CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQuJER, the Chairman was ordered to report progress.
The lonian Subjects Commissions Bill was read a second time.
Mr. LowE moved the second reading of the Passing Tolls Bill.
Mr. T. BARING. called attention to what he alleged -to be exaggerations with relation to Ramsgate hlarbour.
Mr. DEEDES thought this ought to be treated as a private bill, and he appealed to the chair whether its character as regarded Ramsgate harbour did not entitle it to be submitted to the ordeal of a Select Committee ?
Mr. JA3lES M'GREGOR spoke in opposition to the bill, and IMr. WV. S. LLNDSAY in support of it.
Mr. LOCWE, in replying to objections, explained vhat he had stated upon a former occasion with Teference to Ramsgate harbour.
The SPEAK;ER said, according to the practice of the House the biU ought to be referred to a Select Committee.
The bill having been read a second time, on the motion of Mr. 1DEEDES it was ordered to be referred to a Select Committee of nine members, to be nominated by the Committee of Selection.
Colonel Dux7-E moved for leave to bring in a bill -to amenl the law relating to the appointment of officers and management of lunatic asylums in freland.
Mr. For .S made no objec'ion to the introduction of the bill, without pledging the Government to any legislation upon the subject.
Leave wva-s given, and, after some further business, the House adjourned at 20 minutes past 10 o'clock until Monday.

Putting a house to rights after a ball or a removal, setting to at lessous after holydays, or to youir social duties after a tour, may give one some idea of that clearing and fixing sweeping and cleaning, necessary on our comning back to what ought to be our ordinary tenour of peace. To the first impressions the change is almost hopeless. A chaos of Army Works, Transport Services, new vessels. improved weapons, outstanding contracts, imiiprovidenlt purchases, loans, war taxes, and every vvariety of incoming and outgoing, rises to the iiind, and seems to forbid any speedy return to moderate limits or decent regularity. There are semi-barbarous, and even European States, which have never recovered from the overwhehning confusion of such a period. Like a man who has received a heavy blowv to his nervous systemn, and has not had vitality to surmount it, once " struck of a heap" they have fallen never to rise. Enngland possesses, lhappily, witit abundant resources, excellent stamina. She can set to work immediately, and show as clean decks the day after action as the day before. With tlle CHIANCELLOR of the EXcHEQu'ERes speech before us we may now congratulate the British public on being once more on the same pleasant slope of financial reduction as in the days of PEEL. Whether hy existing acts or by new ones, near twelve 1jilliois wvil be reduced from our taxation this year. Of this large sum more than nine millions is obtained by giving up the additional 9J. in the pound of the Income-tax, and by redulcing the duty on incomes between 1001. ai;l 1501. to 5d. in the pound. In three years we have now one more pledge that ev,.n the remaining 7d. will come to an end. Tvo millions of the Malt Duty have already ecpired, and the greater part of a million is siorrendered to the pixblic by reductions on tea, coffee, and sugar. We are aware that a reductiot of wvhich three-fourths fal on the incomes of the upper classes, and a quarter upon articles of general household consumption, will not meet ali views. Strong remonstrances have been made on behalf of paper, fire insurance, spirits, and articles on wbich the question of free trade was supposed to be more at stake. The CHAnNtELL1I03{ the EXCHEQUER very naturally replies that We 'war taxes should conme off first. He retains, ho-wever, the additional duty on spirits, which are not only unnecessary, but even generally injurious, and are, therefore, a very legitimate subject for taxation. In our humble opinion the precedence for remission claimed in behalf of the war duties was quite reason enough for saying no more just now of the duty upon fire insurances, and it was not only superlfluous, but rather injudicious, to say a word in its favour. If there ever was a tax upon prudence it is the 100 per cent. on insuirance against fire. That it happens to be also a tax upon property is but a small recorn-
n.endation, when one considers how much pro. perty has already to bear.
But how is it that we are able to make these reductions, when, as it was believed, there remained such arrears, and aU the public establishments had been swollen by the war to so extravagant a height ? The answer simply is, that there are no arrears, and there is nothing to prevent the establ'shments returning, if not to the old scale, at all events to one of peace. It is very true that all the services, military, naval, and civil, are higher than they were before the war, but it is principally owing to improvements with a view to effectiveness insisted on by the public, and adopted by Parliament, without regard to the late war. It is a fact that there are no arrears. Except the addition of little more than an annual million to the interest of the national debt, we have paid all our bills, and now stand as clear as we did before M1NscHsIoFF landed at Constantinople. There is actually a balance of nearly a milion and a half remaining from the war funds, not to speak of the immense additions and improvements to our naval and military material. By comparing our expenditure during the three years of the war, -that is, up to next April, all things included, with the expenditure of the three previous years, Sir CORNEWALL LVwis arrives at the conclusion that it has cost England 76,000,0001. to arrest the European progress of Russia. By a further comparison of the revenue it appears that of the above sum we provided 40,000,0001. by taxes, and so paid it once for all, and raised almost exactly the same sum by loans, thus going by the simple and honest rule of paying half ourselves and leaving our children to pay the other half, as they might very weU expect to do. We thus raised about 4,000,0001. more than we spent, and are, in fact, 4,000,0001. richer, for financial purposes, than we were before. This calculation, it must be observed, includes the loans to Sardinia and a great deal of expenditure for which we have valuable consideration. It is true that we do not yet entirely get rid of the war taxes, and, so far, have not returned to the very same point at which we stood four years ago. WVe have suspended for a while a few promised reductions, but it is only for a time, and in order to enable us to repay some trifling debts and set our house the more completely in order. In three years at the latest, unless we plunge into new wars, we hope to be meeting a few more of the many cries for financial relief that used to asaail the Treasury about this tinie of the year.
The increasing expenditure of the countryunder all heads is, however, a very startling fact, and no wonder it is the subject of Sir G. C. LEwis's most emphatic remarks. In the Army and Navy, besides a number of temporary causes, such as the dearness of provisions and the completion of large purchases by contract, there are permanent sources of increased expenditure, such as steam, larger dockyards, camps, hospitals, Land Transport, Hospital Corps, the Militia, the new system of the Coastguard, new muskets, new packet lines to all parts of the world. At every possible opening the great spirit of progress has proved expensive to the public. The Civil Services are equally exacting. The public offices, the County Courts, the constabulary, education, and other objects of public necessity or interest, annually encroach on the public purse to the amuount of 200,0001. or 300,0001. at a time; and every such addition is perpetual. Instead, therefore, of the 50,000,0001. a-year, which very recently promised to be the outside of our peace expenditure, the estimate for the next year is over 65,000,0001. Deducting the " collection of the revenue," the repayment of loans, and the Persian expedition, it appears that our present peace expenditure is 7t,000,0001. more than it was before the war; and much of this threatens to be permanent. The CHANCELLOR of the ExcHEQUER, then, does no more than his duty in calling attention to the vast aggregate of a fact which is too usually regarded in the detail. Confessedly the public does want some sober, business-like rules in dealing with its not inexhaustible purse. There is too much of the scramble in the present process. " First " come, first served," or, rather, the strongest hand gets the most; and it is a mattcr of daily occurrence to fix on the public purse an annual charge equivalent to a capital expenditure of 5,000,0001. or 10,000,0001. During the three years of the war we have made more permanent addition to the public expenditure for other objects than we have on account of the war itself. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQU7ER gives a picturesque enunieration of the claims lately made, or stiU made upon him, and he includes some that have been admitted by Parliament. He has omitted some even more expensive and questionable. IThe remedy for confusion is to be found in general rules ; and it certainly would be worth the attention of Parliamenit to frame some system for discriminating between national, local, and private purposes. At present there is no discrimination ; and the stronger hand, or the more forward, gets the largest handful of the public money.

If any one wishes to comprehend at a glance or
If any one wishes to comprehend at a glance or embrace by .a single effort of the mind the prodigious effects of war iipoIn the finances of the country or the true extent of the retrenchments which a return to peace admits, he need only give his attention for one moment to the figures of the Army Estimates, of which an abstract has now been printed. We yesterday stated the number of milions saved upon the Navy, but though the Navy is considered Britain's special arm, aud though in some quarters it is stiU considered that we should fight our battles by ships alone, yet even the economy rendered possible at the Admiralty is dwvarfed and overshadowed by that which can be put in practice at the Waroflice after the signature of peace. The actual difference between the charge for the Army as proposed in this month of February, 1857, and that proposed at the same period only last year is literally almost as much as the interest upon the National Debt ; in fact, we have several times of late years had less to pay upon the permanent funded debt of the country than has been struck off from the expenditure upon the Army during the last 12 months. To say that it amounted to pretty nmuch the same thing whether we brought the war to an end or whether we got rid of the National Debt seems almost incredible, and yet, for the tine, it is positively true. Omitting the Terminable Annuities and unfunded and Exchequer-bills, the charge for the permanent funded debt in the three years immediately preceding 1855 was under 23,7150,0001., whereas the sum saved upon the Army Estimates of the present year is 23,772,9711., and not less than 23,764,6221. upon the effective services alone.
Much of this retrenchment, as the reader is aware, was accomplished in the interval between the early part of last year and the present time, the work having been commenced as soon as peace appeared in view. There were, in fact, two distinct sets of Estimates prepared in 1856, one at the ordinary period for the production of such documents, and another in May, and a stil greater reduction was effected in MIay than is announced now. Setting aside the non-effective services, and premising that the figures to be quoted represmi-da in one amaJgamated sum the
charges formerly distributed over Army, Ordnance, and Commissariat Departments, we may observe that the original Estimate for 1856 amounted to no less than 32,758,2801. In May as much as 14,749,4201. was struck off from this total, which was thus reduced to 18,008,8601., and upon this remainder is now effected a further saving of 9,015,2021., leaving a present demand of 8,993,6581. for the effective services of the ensuing year. The non-effective services add about two millions and a quarter to these figures, and carry the grand total of the Army Estimates up to 11,225,533L
The next inquiry suggesting itself to the mind of the reader will be connected, probably, with the standard of comparison which we adopted yesterday in our analysis of the Navy Estimates. Here is an enormous sum saved beyond a doubt, but how does the account stand when contrasted with the like charges in years of peace ? This question we can answer very promptly by producing again the figures for the years 1853 and 1854, though the comparison is not so completely practicable as in the case of the Navy, owing to the new, and, we may certainly add, the improved arrangement which has been given to the votes. The Army Estimates, as above mentioned, now comprise the Ordnance and Cornmissariat expenses, whereas in past years these appeared under separate computations. Adding, however, Army and Ordnance together, we find that the sum of their charges amounted in 1853 to 9,078,5831a, and in 1854 to 10,133,3641.
We will now enter a little more circumstantially into the details of the abstract before us. The numbers of the land forces proposed to be maintained for the current year (which, exclusive of troops in the East Indies, and inclusive of Ordnance Corps, were in 1853 and 1854 119,881 and 132,243 respectively) are 126,796. In the original Estimate of last year they stood at 246,716 ; so that the Arrmy is reducedby 119,920 men, and the consequent saving upon pay, allowances, and miscellaneous charges is all but six millions of money (5,996,3611.). The demand still remaining under these heads is less than five millions (4,954,0371.); so that we appear to be saving more upon the 119,000 troops which have been disbanded than we spend upon the 126,000 which we maintain-a result probably due to the difference between the charges in times of war and in times of peace. After these comes the vote for the Embodied Militia, or rather its place, for the vote itself disappears entirely, and the whole demand of 3,150,1291. asked on this score at the beginning of last year is struck off. These two reductions alone, it will be observed, yield above 9,000,0001. sterling. The Army Works Corps, with its charge of 408,5951., also vanishes absolutely, and though an existence is still permitted to the volunteer corps, it is at a reduction of more than 80,0001. out of the 88,0001. which they cost. These items comprise every charge under the head of " Forces," or, in other words, the personal or fighting establishment of the Army.
The next group includes the " Civil Establish"ments" connected with the Army, such as the departments of the War Secretary and General Commanding-in-Chief, the manufacturing, store, and barrack establishments, and the wages of artificers and labourers employed, of which aggregate we need only say that upon it 726,5491. has been saved, and 894,7101. is proposed to be expended. The third heading is far more considerable, including, as it does, under the denomination of " Supplies," not only the clothing and necessaries, together with the provisions, fuel, &c., required for the army, but also those warlike stores for sea as well as land service which used to figure so prominently in the Ordnance Estimates of old. Separating the two former items from the third, we find them costing only 1,374,4701. out of 9,886,2611. provided for them in the original estimate of 1856 ; so that the saving is no less than 8,511,7911. on this account alone. The stores, again, which were set in the same reckoning at 3,774,9741., drop to 596,1911. in the estimate now proposed, and we arrive, therefore, at the fact that a larger suni is retrenched under the single head of "Supplies" than is now required for the whole maintenance of the land forces-effective and non-effective services together. Then come "Works and Build"ings," comprising both fortifications and civil buildings, the aggregate estimate for which (the civil being far dearer than the martial works) is 939,3S,31., instead of 2,044,0691. Lastly, we are presented with the estimate for the "Educational " and Scientific Branches" of the service, in which there is also a decrease (10,6601.) ; but we trust that the sum still asked-227,7441.-may suffice to insure the proper efficiency of a department which it is so obviously desirable to maintain in full vigour.
Such are the several items, very intelligibly grouped, which constitute the total of 8,993,6581. required for the effective branch of the Army Estimates. Of the non-effective services we will only add that the entire demand for them, 2,231,8751., shows a smaU decrease (8,3491.) upon the estimate of last year. To the particular items of the whole we hope to refer in greater detail on a future occasion, and to place before the public a clear delineation of the constitution and proportions which our Army has assumed since the experience of the late campaigns.

What is a Minister of Justice? We know what
What is a Mvfinister of Justice ? We know what the officer so called is in France. But what is it which all the lawyers in the House of Commons are so anxious to have under this title in England ? The debate uponl Mr. NAPIER'S motion gives us no information. Is it another great officer of State, with magnificent appointments and a large retiring salary, a seat in the Cabinet, and a present or prospective peerage? No doubt, the creation of such an office would carry with it many sympathies. But what is the new Mmiister to do ? Mr. NAPIER describes him in enigmatic negatives; " he should be sorry to " say he should not be a layman; he should be " equally sorry to say he should not be a lawyer ;" Sir ERsHIiE PERrPy thinks that the LORD CHANCELLOR should be under his supervi-
sion; AIr. WIGRAbi and MIr. EWART advise
that he should have a seat in the House of Commons; Mr. COLIIER believes that he should be some high legal authority; and Mr. LOCKE KiNo already anticipates the pleasure of catechizing him. The speakers agree only in one sentiment,-that he should have a large Staff, and be handsomely paid. Mr. WARREN is rather more explicit, but even his definition does not give us quite enough to know him by. He describes this Minister of Justice as " a spectre which haunts " and oppresses the imaginations of many mem" bers." To a certain extent this definition is correct. This spectral Minister pervades the whole debate. He is spoken of with hope, with fear, with admiration, with dismay. He appears in the form of a Home Secretary, a layman, a lawyer, a Cabinet Minister, a responsible Board, a new State officer; we catch a glimpse of him in some new form at every turn of the debate; and when we have tracked him through every passage and hunted him fairly into the SPEAEER'S box under the table of the House of Commons, we lift the lid, and, lo ! he has vanished! The Mfinister of Justice has entire possession of the debatehe has no place in the resolutions.
Well ight, Mir. CoL.~ER say that "so much.
Cc was said about law reforms each session, and so "little done, that the public might be excused for " believing there was an understanding among the " lawyers to talk but not to act upon the subject." It wi puzzle any man who is not a lawyer to know what relation there is between the creation of a great public department and the evils dwelt upon by the speakers in the debate on Mr. NAPIE'iS motion. The complaint is, that acts of Parliament are carelessly drawn and carelessly passed. County Court judges were put into the schedule of an act of last session, with a blank against their names, to denote the amount of their salaries ; great companies are suddenly extinguished bya rapiddraughtsman who repealsthem outof being by an ill-chosen word; clauses are drawn to govern companies which are long since dead, and to provide for the management of funds which have been non-existent since the time of our grandfathers. Such blunders as these are undoubtedly disg,raceful to every member of any assembly of educated men which commits them; they are especially disgraceful to every lawyer who is a member of that assembly ; but they do not require a high State functionary to prevent them. Each House of Parliament is bound to do its own particular work of legislation in a careful and creditable manner. t is their business, and not the business of the Executive, to take care that their laws are expressed in tolerable English, and are based upon proper inquiry. If the constitution of these assemblies be sucli that they cannot rely upon their own members to do their work, they should take care that it be done by their own officers. There is no lack of officials to sustain the dignity or promote the convenience of either House ; there should be no lack of counsel to enable them efficiently to perform their work. Each House should have an officer of experience whose business it should be to examine bills after they have passed the House, and before they become law. He should point out or reconcile discrepancies, and he should report any doubts he may entertain whether the means provided will reach the end intended. Call him counsel to the Speaker, or by any other name you please. Let his report, if you would guard against all semblance of infringement, be made to the Speaker, who may transmit the suggestions at his discretion, and as his own advice. Pay this officer reasonably, and give him adequate assistance, and then make him responsible to his House for its blunders. He will earn his salary, and we shall have no more of this discreditable legislation.
A simple and a costless precaution may be added. Every bill is now necessarily drawn by a lp.wyer, who receives a fee for his work. Make a standing order that it shall be accompanied by a report signed by the draughtsman, showing the state of the present law, as he understands it, the alterations his bill proposes to make, and the object of such alterations. WVith such a document before them, both the House and its officer will have some startino point for their examination. We would have the signature of the draughtsman rather than that of the promoter, because a man is more careful of his professional reputation than he is of a character for caution in political duties.
These are obvious remedies for an intrusive nuisance. But Mr. NAPIER wiUl probably teU us that his " separate and responsible department" is required to initiate as well as to supervise. Surely, we have such a department already. We pay 1:O,OOO. a-year to the chief, and a not unhandsome remuneration to the six gentlemen who are appointed to assist him. Six years ago we appointed two additional Judges to do what our Lord Chancellors had heretofore done single-handed. The. aids have been so vigorous that Lord CiuxwoRTH opens a seven weeks' sitting in Lincoln's-inn with a list of three appeals. In Chancery he has comparatively nothing to do. A superstition still survives inEnglaudthat a Chancellor is an unhappy State dru Ige, who vainly toils to keep down a hopelessly accumulating amount of work-that he is like a prisoner condemned to the Spanish pump, where the volume of water running into his cell is rather greater than the highest pitch of muscular exertion can pump out. This is a history of other days-of the days of ELDox and BROUGHAM and LYNDHURST. Lord C£-wonvuTH can sit still and hear the water trickle with a quiet smile. Lords Justices XNU-iHT BRIucE and TurEP. will pump it all out and keep his feet dry. So far as his judicial duties are concerned, he is almost as otiose a gentleman as his brother of Lancaster.
What Lord JOHN RUSSELL calls " the inability "of the LoPRD CILANCELLOR to devote his mind to "the subject of law reform" does not arise from want of leisure. But something more than leisure is required in a man who shaU effect that thorough reform in our law which the nation is now so earnestly desiring. Information, power, and knowledge are the conditions of success, and these are not combined in the great functionary who now holds the place of Minister of Justice. Power he has, for the coumtry would take any good measure from his hands and lift it into law with acclamation. Knowledge he might have, for the knowledge of the profession is at his command, and the aid of all his brother Law Lords in the House of Peers would be freely giveu. But without the active and energetic presence of the third quality power is but a lost opportunity, and knowledge is but as pearls cast away.

LIVIERPOOL, Friday.-The amount of specie on board the United States mail steamship Atlantic now due from New York is not known here. The screw steamship Great Britain has left her dock and is anchored in the Sloyne. She will sail on the 16th for Melbourne. Letters to be despatched by her must be marked " Per Great Britain," and must be posted by half-past 11 o'clock; late fee 12 o'clock, noon. This vessel has undergone a thorough refit since her discharge from the transport service, and her accommodations for passengers are unsurpassed, a poopcabin, 95 feet in length, having been added. She will carry a much larger qu-ntity of canvass than ever. The mainmast has been placel 15 feet, and the mizenmast 6 feet, forward of their former position, and she has been fitted with a lfting screw similar to the one carried by the Royal Charter, and which has been proved to work admirably. Her new sternpost is an immense piece of wrought iron.
T.sX TYN- SHIPOW5Ns AND SEA.MEN.-SHIELDS, Feb. 12.-A conferenceof Shieldsshipownersandseamen was held in the Golden Lion Assembly-rooms, South Shields, last nsight, Mr. J. T. Wawn, formerly member for the borough, in the chair, for the purpose of endeavouring to come to a mutual understanding upon the quest,ion of wages for the summer. It will be remembered that a fortnight ago the owners met and determined to reduw the wages of the seamen on the 1st of March to 41. a-vtyage in the London coal trade, 3L 10s. per month in the 8aleic and American trades, and 31. per month in the Mediterranean trade. The men offer to take 51. in the London trade, 41. per month in the Baltic and American, anl 31. IOs. per month in the Mediterranean trades, on the Ist of April A long discussion took place between the owners and seamen, the seamen expressing themselves in friendly and moderate language. They stated that they could not support their families on the wages proposed, for the best omployed men did not average more than eight London voyages in the year, and it was impossible for the family of a sailor to live upon 7s. 6d. a-week, which would be half the wages of a man employed in the Mediterranean trade. The men refused to give up their " manning clauses" or to sail with non-union men, for the reason, in the first place,thatowners were in the habit of indenturing lads for 12 months, 18 months, and two years, and then reckoning them in the last year of their apirenticeship as men. When they were lads (the speakers said) they were aU five years' apprentices, and they were as good as any men in their last year. In the second place, they stated that the greater part of non-union men wero not ablebodied seamen. One old sailor told a yarn of a voyago whero he and the master and mate were the only ablebodied seamen on board a vessel, and upon falling in with a gale of wind all hands but their three selves, he said, went below sick, and he and the master and mate had to reef the sails one side at a time. He asserted, and dared contradiction, that the greater portion of the wrecks were occasioned by vessels being badly manned. The owners, on their side, stated that, n consequence of the competition by screw colliers and railways, they could not be shackled, but must seek their laboer i the cheapest market. They said, with freights at 6s. 4d. per ton to London, they could not give more than the wages they had agreed to at their previous meeting, the chairman stating that there did not appear to be much prospect of a revival of the London coal trade when West Riding coal was delivered at King's. cross at 12s. 9d. per ton. He also alluded to screw collers, and informed the meeting that Mr. Hugh TAylor, one of the owners of the 1,500-ton screw coUier buiding by Mr. Mlitcbell, at Walker, had told him that that vessel, one of a fleet, would make a voyage a-week between Cardiff and London. One of the seamen said that several of the,e screw colliers would be engaged in the Baltic trade in the summer. " Yes," replied the chairman, "but that will make things no better, for they will displace sailing vessels in that trade." Some fnrther discussion took place about the owners redacing the Hamburg, Bremen, and Amsterdam voyages to a London voyage and a third, the men having to work the cargoes at those ports. The men refused to accede to this arrangement, and stand out for a voyage and a half. As all the union seamen in the north-east ports are compacted into one confederation, the Tyne men declined to make any further concessions until the entire body of seamen were consulted; and it was arranged that another conference should be held on the 24th.

SOUTHAMPTO0M, FZB. 13.
The Royal Mail Company's steamer Avon, Captain Revet, arrived this evening with the Brazilian and River Platenails in charge of Lieutenant Henry Stewart, R.N., an& dates from Buenos Ayres, Jan. 2; Rontevideo, 5; Rio der Janeiro, 14; Bahia, 18; Pernambuco, 21; St. Vincent (CapeVerde), 30; Teneriffe, Feb. 4; Madeira, 6; Lisbon, 9,
11us steamer brings 47 passengers and 29 distressed sea_ men, and on freight specie, from Buenos Ayres, value4,856U_ sterling: Pernambuco, 4711.; otber ports, 3Ul.; total, 5,6381. diamonds, value 4,3371. sterling; precious stones, valae 2161. sterling; and a cargo comprising 36 serons of ipecacuanha. 418 barrels of tapioca, 492 serons of cochineal, 7 packages of pareira brava, and t21 packages of sundries.
The Avon's voyage has been retarded by continuous north. easterly winds, fronm four degrees north, and by detention at St. Vincent, Teneriffa, Madeira, and Lisbon, in consequence of being placed in strict quarantine, yellow fever being prevalent at Rio and Pernauibuco, particularly among the shipping at the latter port. Two of the Avon's crew died from yellow fever on the Brazil coast.
There is little poltical news from Buenos Ayres. The saladeros were in fuU activity, and tho only circumstances calculated to limit the extent of their operation were ther diminished number of cattle and the exorbitant prices demanded.
The sales of coffee at Rio since tbo last mail had been to a- regular extent, and amounted to 180,000 bags. The shipments of coffee to Europe in the year 1856 were about 343,000 bags less thai in 1855.' The stock was at present 90,000 to 100,000 bags, most of which were of an inferior quality. Receipts were moderate. The weather had beem rainy and unsettled, and there were different opinions as to, the extent of the new crop; at all evenits, it appeared that a large balance of the present yield stiU remained in theinterior, and tho weather alone would influence its coming to market.
Prices of sugars had advanc ed again; 1,200 cases 750 packages Campos sold at quotations; 120 cases 5,200 bags andL barrels from the north at 4,800 reis to 5,200 reis for white, and 3,200 reis to 3,400 reis for b rown. With the exception of 123 cases 299 barrels for export, all the remainder was for home consumption. Stock, 1,700 cases 750 barrels Campos, and 610 cases 8,039 bags and barrels Pernams.
No hides in stock. Sold, 660 mixei and inferior description at 330 reis.
Exchanges remained very firm. River Plate bills had been passed at 28d. The total amount negotiated upon London for this packet was large, and estimated at about 400,0001. Upon Hamburg large transactions had beet made; the ruling quotation was 652. The busineEs done upon France ruled from 343 to 348 reis per franc. The money.market was easier. The Bank had reduced its rate of discount to S percent. In freights little doing.

We extract the following from the Ba:hia Price CUnrres of tho 17th of January:-
"Sugar.-In the beginning of the week superior qualities sustained their former prices of 4,2D0 reis per arroba for whites and 3,200 for browns, but latterly there was less desire to purchase, and several lists (particularly of the latter description) were rejected at the above quotation. At 4,001) reis to 4,200 for whites and 3,000 to 3,200 (Exchange 2 )d.j, sugars stand in 37s. 6d. to 39s. 4d. and 28e. 3d. to 30s. ld. per cwt., free on boarl, without freight.
"Cotton. -ossalesofimportancehavetakenplace. Last transactions were at 6,100 reis per arroba for Maceios and 6,300 reis for Bahias, at which quotations (Exchange 28d.) it costs 6.16d. and 6-35d. per lb. free on board, exclusive of freight.
" Coffee.-We have had no arrivals from the South, and supplies from the interior have likewise come in but very sparngly; prices remain unaltered, 4,250 to 4,300 reis for unwashed seconds, at which (Exchange 2Sd.), it stands in 42s. 10d. to 43s. 4d. per cwt. free on board, freight excluded.
"Hides are much inquired after, and stocks are exhausted; last sales were at 320 reis per lb. for dry salted and; 350 for dry, at which prices, (Exchange 28d.), they cost about 10-58d. and 11-75d. per lb. free on board, freight excluded.

Yellow fever prevailed to an alarming extent at Rio Janeiro and Pernambuco. The first case made its appearance on board the Avon on the 14th ult., when
harles J. Symonds, the senior surgeon of the company, commenced a most successfol treatment of the maladv. Out of 38 cases, 11 of which were of the most malignait form, two only died, who had black vomit. The gratitnde of both passengers and crew at the skil and attention of Mr. Symonds is more easily imagiRed than described.
The Columbian steamer, of the European and Australian Company, arrived at St. Vincent, on her passage to Australia, in eight days and seven hours from the Needles. The average speed on the passage was 12 knots.

Moral And Intellectual Improvement Of The
MOP-AL AND LNrCELLECTUAL INIPROVEMhIET OF THE
'WORKING CLASSES.-A sairec was given a few nights ago in the schoolroom attached to St. Philip's Church, Bcthnalgreen, for the recreation and improvement of the artisans of that crowded district and tbeir families. The Rev. James Tzevitt, incumbent of St. Philip's, was present, with his curate and several gentlemen, who took an interest in the proceedings. It is the benevolent design of Mr. Trevitt and nis coadjutors thus to provide periodical recreation for his parishioners of a rationaland healthycharacter,viththe viev of alluring them from the baser pleasures of the publichouse and the gin-palace, and the efforts of the rev. gentleman bave hitherto been blessed with success. A very excellent concert was given by a band of self-trained choristers, and several " recitations," including extracts from Shakspeare-s plays, were very respectably delivered by sundry members of the elocution class. Classes are formed, or are to be formed, for instruction in music, drawing, mathematics, and other branches of general education, and no exertion is being spared to improve the moral and inteUectual status of the inhabitants. Mr. Trevitt was very warmly received by his parishioners, and several well-merited compliments were paid to the rev. gentleman in the course of the evening by gentlemen who addressed the meeting at intervals.

A bill authorizing the inhabitants of Oregon to form a constitution and State Government, preliminary to admission into the Union, was also passed. An amendment was carried confining the suffrages at the election for delegates to frame a constitution to citizens of the United States.
A despatch from New Orleans states that Greytown was in possession of the Costa Ricans, and that Walker had not been heard of for some time.
Advices from Tampico to the 31st of December state that General Garcia, formerly Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Tamaulipas, in revenge for being deprived of the command of Tampico by the revolution of the 30th of October, had seized the goods belonging to various mercantile houses in transit to the interior, although they had been regularly despatched by the Custom-house of Tampico; he had caused them to be sold in Victoria for onefourth of their value, underhandedly buying them in himself. A large part of these goods belonged to American houses. At the last dates he had placed his men on the roads leading from Tampico, and. they seized upon all goods that left for the interior. Another despatch-says that a battle had occurred between Garcia's troops and the Government forces, the latter claiming the victory. It occurred at Old Town, which was completely pillaged by the invaders. Garcia was advancing on Tampico, when another battle was expected. The American Consul had requested the United States authorities at New Orleans to send a revenue cutter for the protection of the American residents, and to prevent the pillage of the town.
Respecting Central America the New York Herald says, " Nicaragua, under President Rivas at Leon, has suddenly come to a friendly understanding with Costa Rica, the latter having, no] doubt, receded somewfhat also under the Filibuster pressure of Walker, and a new boundary line between them has been adopted. This new line is the San Juan River, the entire south bank of which, with Punta Arenas and the Transit Company's staton, are added to Costa Rica. Under the joint rights conferred by this arrangement a new grant of the transit route becomes necessary, under the joint action of the two Governments. To cap these advices from Costa Rica comes the letter of our Washington correspondent, stating that two commissioners have arrived here, with full power to seU the grant of the Nicaraguan route."

Friday Evening.
The recent improvement in the funds has been fairly maintained to-day, although, owing to a revival in the demand for money, the market was less firm towards the rlose. Consols, which left off yesterday at 93W, were first quoted 931- to J. Subsequently they touched 94, and the last official prices were 03i to 94 for money, and 941 to J for the account ; but after regular hours there was a reaction of an eighth. The monthly statement of the Bank of France produced rather a favourable effect. The chief operations of the day, however, arose out of the opinions entertained as to the probable character of the Budget. Bank Stock left off at 216 to 218; Reduced, 94 to i; New Threa per Cents., 94i to ,; India Stock, 218 to 220; India Bonds, ls. discount to is. premium; Exchequer-bonds, 98i to 4; and Exchequer-bills, par to 4s. prenuium.
Foreign securities exhibited increased firmness3 but the highest quotations were not in all cases supported. Turkish Six per Cents., for money, were negotiated at 94i and J; for the account, 95, 95k, -, and 95. In the Four per Cents. Guaranteedtransactions took place for money at 101k ; and for the account at 10l1 and J. The general business comprised New Grenada, Active, 22j; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., for account, 80; Portuguese Three per Cents., 441; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 96Q and 97k; Sardinian Five per Cents., for account, 90(; Spanish Three per Cents., for account, 40i and I; and Spanish Certificates, 6a and i.
In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates generaUy showed no alteration from last post.
The corn-market this morning was again heavy.
The report of the LIverpool cotton-market for the week shows a steady business, with a tendency to improvement at the close.
The final prices of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 68f. 40c. for money, and 68f. 65c. for the end of the month, showing a further improvement of an eighth.
The monthly statement of the Bank of France published to-day is, on the whole, more favourable than had been anticipated. Indications, however, are still afforded that it is only by the most stringent means that the drain of specie can be counteracted. Judging from the amount paid during the month for premiums on gold it may be assumed that considerably more than 1,000,0001. was thus obtained by artificial purchases, with no ultimate result beyond an increase of 146,0001. in the amount held, the total stock being now 7,805,0001. Meanwhile the general position of the Bank has been strengthened by a reduction of 682,0001. in the note circulation and of 792,0001. in the liabilities to depositors. In the discounts there has been a diminution of 1,450,0001., usual at this season, the demand in the previous month for the opening of the year having been excessive. The Treasury balance presents an augmentation of 180,0001. In the advances on stocks and shares there has been a further contraction of 212,0001., and their aggregate amount is now less than 2,000,0001. The premiums paid for gold were 15,6001.
It is understood that commissioners from Russia have lately been in London to negotiate for the purchase of steamers on behalf of the great company for forming the Black Sea flotilla, ostensibly intended for postal and trading services. Several owners of vessels which were employed as transports during the war have succeeded in makincr sales to the company, and more are said to be wanted.
In the colonial produce markets during the week the amount of business has again been considerable. Prices have been generally steady, with a tendency to dullness at the close. At the commencement sugar met with a full inquiry, and rather higher rates were paid, but at to-day's sales the trade purcbased less freely, and white Benares went at a reaction of about 6d. The coffee-market is active, with a further tendency to improvement ; mocha, particularly, has realized much higher quotations. A renewed demand has sprunog up for rice at slightlyimproved rates for commonkinds. Sound rice is allowed to be used for distillation in France, and this will probably relieve this market of a large portion of the surplus on hand. Saltpetre attracts more attention, business to some extent beina transacted at a slight advance. A larg,'e
quantity of nitrate of soda has been disposed of at I l9s. to 19s. (id. per cwt. The indigo sales, which opened without animation, have dauing the last t.o days progressed rather more favourably. Good shipping Bengals are about 3d. dearer. In the tea-
market bhe business has again been chiefly limited I to the requirements of the retail dealers. In common congou comparatively few operations have taken place, speculators waiting the arrival of telegraphic news from China. The quotation for commuon is Is. Old., and at this but little is to be met with. At the conclusion of the public sales on Monday a fair spirit was manifested by the trade, and of 11,000 packages brought forward 2,900 found buyers. The arrivals of the week have been numerous. Public sales are announced for Tuesday, the 17th inst.
A correspondent mentions, with reference to the recent accounts of the cattle disease in Poland, and the statement of its having caused an advance in tallow, that, so far from its having a favourable influence on that market, it would be likely, in the view of many persons, to act in the opposite direction by leading to a hasty slaughter of herds to escape the chances of their being attacked. The real causes of the existing high price of tallow consist, he contends, in an unusually large quantity having been locked up during the winter in the ice at Cronstadt, and in the heavy purchases made by a number of operators in London.
At a meeting of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China, held this afternoon, Mr. T. A. Mitchell, M.P., presiding, the report and statement of accounts were adopted. It was intimated that the directors have strengthened the board by the accession of new names and capital, and that they wiU now shortly be in a position to commence business. To carry out the necessary arrangements an ininiediate call of 21. per share is to be made, and a further call of 21. payable in two months, constituting, with the 6!. already subscribed, the total contribitioni required by the charter. The payment of the remaining 101. will be spread over two years. At present, the directors propose to confine their attention to the trade of India and China, which, through its great increase, requires, in their opinion, enlarged banking facilities. Establishments will be opened at Bombay and Calcutta, and at the two principal ports in China should the war not interfere with commercial intercoiurse; but it is not intended to start branches in Australia unless under arrangements with old established banks. Both the chairman and MIr. w. S. Lindsay entered into statistics to show that the development of the resources of these countries, the extension of cotton cultivation, the facilities afforded by Indian railways, and the bullion operations with A ustralia, will furnish a profitable field of enterprise. Several speakers supported these views, and there being only one dissentient his suggestion to wind up was withdrawn. It was stated that the establishments wiU be organized by the end of the summer, so as to be ready to take part in the trade of the ensuing autumn.

Spinners are again more difficult to deal with, in consequence of cotton being dearer, and prices are against the buyer. Good Orleans and Upland cotton are Ad. per lb. dearer than this day week, and spinners are endeavouring to get a proportionate advance. In finer yarns values have advanced more considerably, and buyers whose orders bear date only a few days back have been disappointed, except in cases where they have given a fair margin of discretion to their agents. The yarnmarket generally displays rather more animation than for some weeks past, but the aggregate transactions have not been important in amount. The spinners of coarse numters are at great disadvantage in the present state of the cotton market, and are resorting, in many instances, to short time In cloths there has been rather more business in fabrics fo the Levant, but with this exscepton buyers have operate I vith grcat caution.

Sir, -The enelosed is from an undoubted sotree, and of too great importance for me to feel justified in withholding it from the publio press.
Mr. Anderson, as leader of the last expedition to the shores of the entrance of the Great Fish River, and as a servant of the H1udson's Bay Company, would not have merely forwarded an idle rumour to Sir George Simpson when it reflected on his employers, and added one more to the many proofs that the starving crews of Franklin's ships reached the Hudson Bay territory, and as yet have not been leached or discovered. Indeed, their fate is still wrapped in mystery, in spite of the relics brought from Beechey Island by Penny, and from Anerica by Rae.

EXTRACT OF A LETTER DATED RIED RIV-EB SETTLELENT,
nIUDSON BAY TERRITORY, DEC. 6, 18aG.
"I received a letter from Roderick by the last mail, and ho expresses a wish that I should write to you by the hrst opportunity, and state more particularly about the reports we heard last summer about some traces of whites Deing seen in the north.
" I have just returned from -, who was at Norwayhouse last July, and saw the man who brought down an express to Sir George Simpson from MIr. Anderson* in Mackenzie's River (district), stating that Indians had brought over reports to one of the trading posts in that quarter that Indians had seen two or more encampments of whites on an island on some point where Anderson and Stewart turned back (in 1855), and that one of the encampments particularly was quite fresh, supposed to have )'een abandoned a day or two before the lndians saw it, and from the traces thought there might have been about 10 or 12 men.
" I could not hear of the exact locality further than that Anderson and Stewart vwere within a very short distance of the place where the traces were seen. I hope you have heard more particularly about the report."
Commander of the late searhing boat party down the Fih River.

CLAPHAM. CO.;fM3ON.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-In consequence of the statement of the Srrveyor to the Wandsworth Board o,f Works on the subject of Clap. ham-common, " that I had indulged in anticipat-g evils which I had not actually seen," I beg to state that on Monday morning, the day on which my former letter appeared, I went to the spot, and found two labourers with two carts removing gravel, and yesterday the common-keeper reported the measure of this opening. The size of this which the surveyor calls one of the " trial shafts," was 4i feet long by 8 feet wide, and the depth 6 feet (; inches to 7 feet, and there had been about 40 or 50 cubic vards of gravel dug up, and heaped on the common; so there was something more than imagination here. Besides this there were three other smaller openings, measuring 7 feet long by 4 feet wide.

EHNERAL POST-OFFICE, Feb. 10.-Mlails for BMalta, Egypt, and Ceylon will be made up at th:s office for convevance by the new line of Australian contract packets on each occasion of their despatch, both by the route of Southamnpton and by that of Marseilles, thus affording an additional monthly communication vith those places. The dates fixed for the departure from London of mails by these packets, as already announced, are- vi& Southampton, oxn the morning of the 24th inst., and of the 12th of each subsequent month; rid Marseilles, on the evening of the 28th IDst. and of the 16th of each subsequent month. Whon, however, the 12th of the month fails on a Sunday the mails rid Southampton will be made up on the previous eveuing - and when the 16th of the month falls on a Sunday thd mails sid MarseiWles will be made up on the following ewvuing. Letters, newspapers, &c., addressed to Malra, Egypt, and Ceylon will be forwarded by the Australiani packets, or by the Indian mail packets, according as they mnay be posted in time for either line (unless specially directed to be sant otherwise), the rates of postsge and the regulatiorLs of trans. nlission being the same in both case.
TiHi ISSUE OP MONEY.-A correspondence between the Treasury and the Auditor of the Exchequer, respecting the issue of money in the year 181 1, has been reprinted byorder of Parliament. It involves the refusal of Lord Gren yleo, the then Auditor of the Exchequer, to issue money on certain Treasury warrants for the ansy and navy. The warrants appear to have been issued on the sole authorit v of the Lords of the Treasury, without the proper warranir under the Great or Privy Seal. The warrant of the Lords of the Treasury was not held by the law officers of the Crown to be a sufficiont authority for issuing the inoneys in question, and Lord Grenville therefore declined to do so.
HIGHWAY ROBB3ERY.-A highway robbery was perpetrated on Wednesday evening last in a somewhat solitary place, called Holme-lane, between the villages of Fa,neck and Holme, near Leeds. Mr. George Crossley, of the hotel at Fulneck, was driving a cow up the lane in question, between 7 and 8 o'clock, 'when suddenly three men rushed upon bim from the sides of the lane and knocked 3bim down. One of the men held Mr. Crossley's head to the grltd by kneeling on his neck, another held his hands while leaning over his body, and the third emptied his pockets, robbing hins of three half-sovereigns, about 25s. in silver, some copper, a knife, and his cap. The violonce used in bringing hinu to the ground and keeping him there left Mr. CroSsley ma state unable to rise for above half an hour after the 3illains had left him, hut perfectlt onuscious of all that passed. As soon as he wa abJe to rise and walk he went to Mr. Ho_pkinson'P, the e house, where !ssistancewmwaindlygiven. Thecow was found in an adoining field.

IN BANKRUPTCY.
EX PARTE RMNISDEN kND B.RXITlt, 1N 1E. RkISDEN AND
rtA vrpit
(Before the LoRDS JUSTICJ'S or APPEAL.)
This was a petition of appeal by the bankrupts. Messrs. Thomas Ramsden and William Bradford Baxter, of Bailiffebridge, Yorkshire, worsted spinners and mniufacturers, wlho having been adjudged bankrupt were wholly refused their certificates, with protection for 21 days to give theun time to appeaL. The judgment was pronounced by Mr. Coinmissioner Ayrton, of the Leeds District Court of Bankruptcy. The grounds of the learned commlissioner's judgment were bad bookkeeping, the issue of a great amount of accommodation bills, undue preference to a particular creditor, and an absence of full disclosure of thq bankrupts of their pro-
hr. SWANSTON (with Mr. Bagley) appeared for the appelants, and had at considerable length opened the case when he stated that a proposition had been laid before the counsel for the assignees and for the opposing creditors, which he trusted their Lordships would not disapprove, and which appeared to be satisfactory. The terms proposed were that Mr. Baxter, the younger bankrupt, should have an immediate certificate of the third class, and the other bankrupt a certificate of the like nature, wfith suspension for three years and no protection for 12 months.
Mr. CAIRNS, for a large body of opposing creditors, in an4*or to a question from the Court, said that, considering th the proposed order was highly penal, and perhaps sufficiently so to satisfy the justice of the case, he had no desire to oppose the arrangement.
Mr. BACON, who (with Mr. Do Gex) appearedl for the assignees, added that, although the conduct ot the bankrupts had been sbown upon the evidence to be very reprehensible, the assignees did not consider it their duty to offer any opposition to the mode of settlement which was
proposed.
Their LoRD6nsn11 accordingly made an order that the bankrupt Baxter should have an immediate certificate of the third class, and that the bankrupt Rameden should have a certifieate of the same class at the end of three years from this day, and this to be without protection for 12 nionths from the present day, this order being made on the consent of the creditors, the assignees not opposing, and their Lordships giving no opinion upon the jadgment of the learned commissioner.
EX PARTE SAUIUEL, IN RE SAMIUEL.
This was a petition of appeal against the decision of Mtr. Commissioner Coulburn, reported fully and repeatedly in the columns of TDc TimOs, by which the bankrupt, Ir. Lyon Samuel, was remanded to prison for not making satisfactory answers in his examination, and his last examination adjourned sine die.
Mr. Swanston and Mr. Clement Swanston stipport the appeal; Mr. Bacon and Mr. Petersdorff (of the common law bar) appear for the respondents.
The case is not concluded.

(Before Vicc-Chancellor Sir RI- T. KLNDERSLEY.)
Mr. BOVILL moved in this caso to discharge the common order at the Rolls allovwing the defendant to sue in formsd paupcris, on the ground that he was tenant of a house under Lord Ashburnham, worth 101. a-year, was entitled to an annuity of 201. granted by the Fishmongers' Company, and, as representativo of his father, to other property. "Rogers v. Hooper," 2, Weekly Reporter (474), " Parkinson v. Chambers," 3, Ibil. (34), 'Ronnilly v. Gruit," 2, Beav, (1so), and other cases, were cited in support of the
Mr. TAYLOR opposed the motion, and contended that the common order applied to the case of property available for the purposes of the suit, which none of this property was. The house he was merely tenant at will of, the annuity was w;ithout power of assignment or anticipation, and the pro. perty was not available at present, whatever it might even.
The VICE-CHANCELLOR said that tlle order must be discharged with costs. The defendant bimself relied upon a document under which lie claimed to be entitled to certain property of considerable value ; there was also a subsisting annuity, and this was said, in his own affidavit, to be the subject-mnatter of the suit, but he now contended at the bar that this was a mistake, and that alone would disentitle him to the common order, and on the present deeia probably to the special order. But upon principle the order must be discharged with costs.

The bill was filed by vendors for the specificperformanceofan agreement, dated in April, 18o4, for the purchase for 8,0861. Ss. of land which was described in the agreements as containing 80,8G4 square yards, and as being held of the manor of Wesb Derby, in Lancashire, except a small portion thereof which was held of the Commissioners of Waste Lands at West Derby at the yearly rent of 6s. The agreement stipulated that the vendors should adduce a good title to the land agreed to be pur. chased, and that if any objection made by the purchaser should not be removed he should be at liberty to vacate the sale and annul the contract on giving one calendar month's notice to that effect to the vendors. Severalquestions were raised at the bar as to the vendors' title, but that on which the case was decided wasastowhetherthevendorswere bound to show a good title in fee simple to the piece of land heldoftheCommissionersofWaste Lands at West Derby. It appeared that the vendors, in reply to the purchaser's requisitions respecting that piece of land, had undertaken to show such a title, but that not having done so on the 15th of February, 1855, the purchaser gave notice of his intention to vacate the contract at the expiration of one calendar month from that period, on the ground of the vendors not having deduced a good title to the property contracted to be sold. A good title had not yet been shown to that piece of land. It was contended on behalf of the vendors that as such piece of land contained only 282 square yards, and was not essential to the enjoymenb of the rest of the property, it was a fair subjeeb for compensation to the purchaser, and that the defective title as to it was not a good ground for refusing relief to the vendors. The vendors in their bill did not offer to make compensation to the purchaser.
Mr. Wigram and Mr. Edward Harrison were for the vendors; and Mr. Malins and Mr. Charles Hall for the purchaser.
The VICE-CHANCELLOR, after reviewing at great length the several questions raised in the course of the argument, said that the vendors had bound themselves to show a title in fee simple to the piece of land held by the Commissioners of Waste Lands at West Derby, not only by the terms of the contract, but by their having undertaken to do so in reply to the purchaser's requisitions respecting that piece of land. As they bad also in their bill made a general averment of their having adduced a good title to the lands agreed to be sold, the case was one in which the question of compensation could not be entertained. On the whole the bill must be dismissed, with costs.

Court Of Queen's Bench, Guildhall, Feb. 13.
COURT OF OUEN'S RRNflITT C ri-r.1T P-n 19'
SHEPHERD V. E AN(Trnrr A '1 I Q
(Before Lard CAMPBELL and Special Juries.)
Sir F. Thesiger and Mr. Manisty appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Bovill, Q.C., and Mr. lioneymiian, for the defendants.
The trial of this cause occupied the Court the whole of yesterday, and it was resumned this morning.
The plaintiff. Edward Shepherd, was a titmiber merchant; the defendants, Messrs. Engstroms and Neame, were Baltic merchants; and the other defendants, Messrs. Churchill and Sim, were timber brokers in the city. The gotion was brought to recover damages for a falhe representa&on alleged to have been made by the defendants to the plaintiff as to the dimensionis and quality of a quantity of timber sold by the defendants to the plaintiff at a public auction at Garraway's. It appeared from the plaintiffs evidence that in the month of September, 1855, Alessrs. Engetrom and Neame imported a cargo of deals from Gelle, in Sweden, by the ship Typhon. The deals were shipped as being 14 feet in length, and 3 inches by 9 inches in thickness and width. When the cargo arrived in London the deals were landed in the Commercial Docks, and after being measured they were piled on the quay, not according to the dimensions under which they were shipped, but according to what is termed " dock measurement." It appeared that deals imported from the different Ports in the Baltic varied considerably in width, owing to the imperfect nature of the sawing machinery employed; aud according to "dock measurement" all deaLs which did not exceed S2 inches in width w.ere classed as 8-inch deals, while those which exceeded that width were classed as 9- inch deals. The deals thus classed were piled on the quay in separate piles, and this was done in reference to the duty payable to the Government. The deals remained piled in this statefor about six months, till the month of April, 1856, when it was proposed they should be pot uD to sale by public auction. In anticipation of this sale the defendants, Messrs. Churchill and Sim, who were acting as Messrs. Engstrom and Neame's timber brokers, -w rote to the superintendent of the Commercial Docks, and requested that the deals should be mixed and repled. This was accordingly done, and the deals which had been classed as 9-inch deals were again intermixed with those which had been classed as 8-inch deals. A catalogue of the cargo in question was then made oub and printed, and it also contained other cargoes of timber insported fromn other ports in the Baltic. The timber was then exposed to public inspection, preparatory to the sale. The plaintiff, having seen the catalogue, sent one of his men to exammie the goods, and, being satisfied with his report, he purchased several lots, amoumiting in all to about 2,h0 deals. NYhen the goods were deliverei to the plaintiff
be wasvmh tisied, e or he found that insteadl of being of th"fr~ality," as he oxpeoted, they were of a very inferior description, and, insteRad of being 9 inches wide, a laree num'ber of them (846) could oaly be classed as 6-inch deals, as not exceig~ inches in width. H:e therefore sentfo 51aesars. Cburchill and Sim, the brokers, aikd told them that he should return the goods, as they would not suit his
prose ; andl he subsequently sold them by auction, at,a lois including all eharges, Of about 1041. 5s. 94d. The present action was then, brought to recover damages for the
corne up to the description in which it was shipped, clear'y showed a fraudulent intention, especially as it was stated by the witnesses that it was not usual in the trade to repile tini,ber. A large number of the best deals were also put on the top of'the pile, and thus deceived the plaintiff's man who examined them. The description given in the catalogue of the deals as being 3 inches by 9, was also relied upon to show that there had been a faise representation ot their dimensions; and it was contended that whatever effect the words, "as shipped," miht be asupposedto have as qualifying the previous description, thoy could have none on the subsequent representatitn that the deals were of the " first quality."
The defence was that there had bt en no mnisrepresentation made either as to the dinsenLsins or quality of the timber. It was shown that Messrs. Engstromn and Neame had received a consignment of the carg.l in question for sale on commission, and that, in ordering the deals to be mLxed and repiled, they had done no mnore than restore them to the condition in which they were when they were shipped, and when they were first landed on the quay. As to the description in the catalogue, it was shown that where dock measurement was intended the dimensions (3x9) were given without any addition, and ti.i, was comumonly understood in the trade to mean " dock measurenient ;" but where the description was " 3 x 9 as shipped," as in the present instance, that was only understood as a representation that such was the description under which the deals were shipped, and it was to be expected, in such case, that many of the deals would be deficient in size. The same argument was used as to the meaning of the words "first quality," whch it was contended meant no more than that the goods were shipped as of the best quality. At the sitting of the Court this morning,
The defendants Churchil and Sum, who had acted for the other defendants in the matter, stated that they gave no instructions whatever as to the mode in which the deals should be piled, and that the best deals had been placed on the top of the pile by the dock servants, without any orders given by them to that effect.
As soon as these witnesses had been examined,
Mr. BoVsL rose and said he bad called the defendants Churchill and Sim in order that they might have an opportunity of denying that they had given any orders to put the best deals on the top of the piles; but as to the charge of fraud, he was informed that his learned friend (Sir F. Thesiger) was prepared to withdraw that charge, and, under those circumstances, the defendants thought it heat became their position in the city of London to indemnify the plaintiff against the loss which he had sustained, including the expenses of this trial.
Sir F. THEscsoER said he acquitted the defendants, who were gentlemen of great respectability, of any intentional f raud. They had acted according to a custom in the trade, which was most irregular and improper, and the sooner it was: got rid of the better. But he (Sir F. Thesiger) acquitted them of doing more than acting according to a vicious custom, and was ready to withdraw on the understanding that the plaintiff should be ine emnified for the consequences and the coats.
Lord CAMPBELL said he thought this arrangement did great credit to both parties. The plaintiff, as a reasonable man, might have expcoted a different result from his purchase; but as the action rested on a charge of personal fraud there would be great difficulty in maintaining it. He (Lord Campbell) expressed his belief that the defendants did not mean to do anything wrong; hat his Lordship thought that the custom which it was stated prevailed in the trade was very mnuch to be reprobated. His Lordship enlarged on the imoportance of merchants maintaining in their transactions a character for that ulber,-ima fides for Which English merchants had been hitherto celebrated, and he was glad that this cause had been tried before a jury of 12 gentlemen who had formed a strong opinion, not against the defendants, but against the practice which they had followed. He hoped tbat such practices would be abstained from in future, not only by the defendants, but by all traders.
A juror was then withdrawn on the terms above stated. DE LA RUE AND OTHERS V. DICKcENSON AND OTsERS.
Sir F. Thesiger, MIr. Grove, Q C., Mr. Hindmarch, and Mr. Lush appeared for the plaintiffs; Uir. Serjeaut llles, MIr. H. Hill, Q.C., Mr. Bovill, Q.C., and Mr. Webster for the defendants.
The plaintiffs in this action, Messrs. De la Rue and Co., were the well-known manufacturers of envelopes, and the defendants, Meessrs. Dickenson and Co., were gentlemen largely engaged in the same department of manufacture. The action was brought to recover damages for the infringement of two patents granted to the plaintiffs in 1845 and 1849, for improvements in the manufacture and folding of envelopes. Prior to the year 1345 envelopes were cut and eseased by machinery, and were afterwards folded by hand, but in that year the plaintiffs obtained a patent for a machine which performed both operations-the folding as wel as the creasing. The gumming was still performed by hand, but in the year 1849 the plaintiffs obtained another patent for an improvement to the former machine, whereby they adapted the system well known as " surface printing" to the gumming of envelopes while in the course of being folded. A few months before the plaintiffs took out their second patent, in 1849, a Frenchman named Remond obtained a patent for the manufacture and folding of envelopes, and, the defendants having becomne the purchasers of that patent, they were now sued by the plaintiffs on the ground that, while professing to act under lemond's patent, they had in fact infringed both the plaintids' patents. The question thus raised was whether the defendants had infringed either or both of the plaintiffs' patents.
At the rising of the Court the trial was adjourned till to-morrow (this day).
SECOND COURT.
(Sittings at Misti Prims, at Guildhall, before Afr. Justice
ERLE and Common Juries.)
ILcRTLEY V. PONSO Y.Sy.
Mr. H. Hill, Mr. Milward, and Mr. C. Clark were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Knowles and Mir. Haskett for the defendant.
The declaration stated that the defendant had promised to pay the plaintiff at Liverpool 401. for taking a ship called the Mobile from Port Phillip, in Australia, to Bombay.
The defendant pleaded-first, that he did not make the promise; then, that by virtue of certain ship's articles whhice had been made between the parties, and which were in force at the time of the alleged promise, the plaintiff was bound, if required, to perform the voyage mentsoned in that count as the consideration for the promise, and there was no consideration for the defendant making the promise.
Mr. HucH HILL, in stating the plaintiff's case, observed that it was a question of great importance, and would require the most attentive consideration of the jury. The action was brou-ht to recover the sum of 401. The defendant was captain and part owner of the Mobile, a large ship of 1,000 tons' burden, and having a complement of 36 hands. The plaintiff shipped on board the vessel at Liverpool and signed articles at 31. per month. The voyage was from Liverpool to Australia, and thence, if required, to the Chinese seas, and so home again. The ship took out emigrants to Australia, and arrived at Port Philip in October, 1852, when out of the 36 men 17 of them left the ship and refused to sail any longer, it being the habit ef the men to leave the ships and go to the diggings. In consequence of this the defendant put the law m force, and took the 17 men before the magistrate, and they were sent to gaol. They refused to return to their duties. Twelve out of these 17 were ablebodied seamen, and out of the 19 men who remained there were only five able seamen, who were entirely unfit to work the vessel and to navigate it with safety. The ship was therefore unseaworthy, and the seamen were not bound to go in it. The captain, when he found the 17 men would not return to their duty, made a proposal to the remaining crEw that, if they would consent to work the vessel to Bombay, their wages should be increased to 121. a-month. I'he crew had no faith in the owners, but they believed the captain would keep his promise, and he gave them a document to this effect:-" I promise to pay Hartley 40l., provided he assists in taking the ship from this port to Bombay with the crew of 19." The first thing the defendant pleaded was that he did not make the agreement, but that would be proved. The defendant then said that there was no consideration, for the plaintiff was already under articles' and bound to proceed on the voyage. The plain' tiff, however, contended that the crew were incapable of navigating the vessel, for the police officer and his men were obliged to help weigh the anchor. When the vessel sailed the men were compelled to adopt one continued watch. The hardship and risk were extreme, and were endured by the men on the faith of the promise given by the captain. Upon the arrival of the ship at Liverpool the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff, and this action became necessary. The question was one of considerable importance to the shippinginterest, and the jury would be careful in comieg to a decision.
The plaintiff and several of the crew by their testimony supuorted this statement.
Mr. IKNOwVL15s first submitted that the plaintiff must be nonsuited.
Mr. Justice EB . r thought the better course would be to have the whole t- *ts before the Court, and then some course might be adopted to prevent the parties being put to the expense of coming down again.
Mr. KoNyOLEs then addressed the jury for the defendant. The chief point of his defence was that the plaintiff was already under articles, and that if he entered into any other agreement it was an invalid one, inasmuch as he was driven by the circunmstances to enter into it, and it was without consideration.
The defendant stated that four of the deserters were brought on board in irons. The crew said those men would not work; the defendant said he thought they would when they got to sea. The crew said those men ilnust be put on shore, and then the remainder must have G0L. The defendant said he could not give them 601., but he would give them 401., and then the notes for that amount were given. The four nien were sent ashore, and the next morning the ship sailed. They let go the bower anchor on the Ms.Iabar coast, and the crew got up that anchor, which was the same anchor that was down at Port Phillip. Allthe other men had said about its being a different anchor was false. He did his best to procure additional hands, but without success.
Mr. Justice ERLE said there were three questions-first, whether the nsen did not, in fact, refuse to go on the voyage from Port Phlip to Bombay unless additional wages were agreed to; secondly, whether, in the opinion of the jury, the captain could reasonably have obtained additional hands; and thirdly, whether it was unreasonable or improper for the captain toproceedon the voyage with the reduced crew.
The jury retired, and on their return into court found a verdict which was in effect a verdict for the plaintiff; the defendant to have liberty to move.
HOLIMES V. HARDLG.
Mr. Overend and Mr. Cbarles Clark were counsel for the plaintiff, and gr. Edwin James for the defendant.
This was an action for work and labour done and performed, and upon au account stated. The plaintiff was a plumber at Lewisham, and the defendant was a builder of the same place. In June last a gentleman was about to build a villa at Lee, and he made offers for tenders for the building. The defendant obtained the contract, and he sublet the plumbing work to the plaintiff. Aftor the work
was done the plaintiff asked for his money for extra work which he had done, but the defendant said he could not pay, him then. The plaintiff then asked him to give him an
acceptance, and sent him a bill for that purpose, which, however, he had never returned.
There was no general interest in the case. The jury found for the plaintiff.
SlLAWV V. BA=TY.
Mr. Horne and Mr. Russell were counsel for the plain. tiff; and Mr. Edwin James for the defendant.
This was an action, brought to recover damages un3er these circumstances :-It was alleged that the defendant, a
inning agent, kept a dog vhich was fierce, savage, and dangerous.
On the 15th of May the plaintiff, who was a servant, was engaged by the defendant. She came in the evening of the 17th of May. On the following morning, when at breakfast, sho heard the noise of a dog; soon afterwards she opened the kitchen and a large dog few at her throat, tore her breast, and bit both her legs and her hand. She managed to get inside the kitchen, the dog following her, but she jammed his head between thedoor and thedoorpost. She Was very much injured, and was attended by a surgeon for a fortnight. The defendant said a former servant had been bitten, but notso severely as the plaintiff. She left the service, and Mrs. Batty said she should pay for her maintenance during the time of her being unable to go again into service. However, Mrs. Batty repented of this and refused to pay. The poor woman got into service, but her wounds broke out afresh, and she was obliged to leave, and remained out of place for three months. The defendant had been aware that on former occasions the dog had injured persons, he having on one occasion actually bathed the wounds of one of tne persons. Application was made to the defendant,who said he would do what was right, but he would not be imposed upon; he sent her 12s., and offered to let her have 11. 4s. more for a month's wages. The defendant said he had given the dog to a friend, who had said he was " a remarkably quiet and playful fellow." He also stated that any further application must be made to his solicitor.
The dog had drawn the staple out of his kenneL There were four or five other dogs.
Mr. JAEZEs said that the defendant was obliged to keep a house dog, as he lived in a lonely place and he was afraid of tioket-of-leave mea, but he had agreed to consent to a verdict for 151.
The jury said they thought it was very handsome.

This was an action brought by the plaintiff, who is a sbipbroker in London, to recover a balance of 1781. from the defendants, who are shipowners at Liverpool. The defendants paid 611. into court, and as to the rest pleaded that they were never indebted.
Mr. Wilde, Q.C., and Mr. Cleasby appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Serjeant Shee and Mr. Powell, for the defendant.
The sole question in the case was whether the plaintiff had authority from the defendants to make advances of 61. a-month to Mrs. Wood, the wife of the captain of a vessel of the defendants, called the Pajabstan, which had been chartered by the plaintiff for a voyage to Hongkong iu 1852. Captain Wood was caUed as a witness for the plaintiff, and he swore that he told Mr. Ewing, one of the defendants, that he wished the payments in question to be made to his wife during his absence, and in his presence delivered an acknowledgment of the payments to Mr. Robertson, an agent of the plaintiff, and the plaintiff swore that he made the advances upon that authoritv. On the other hand, Mr. Ewing swore that no such conversation took place as that described by the captain, and that he never knew of any written authority to make the advances, or heard that they had been made, till February, 1854, when he immediately repudiated all liability in respect of these payments. It transpired that the captain had been dismissed at Melbourne, and that there were disputed claims between him and the defendants to the amount of 9001.
Mr. Justice WILLES, in summing up, said the question for the jury was simply whether the plaintiff had authority from the defendants to make the advances.
The Jury found a verdict for the plaintiff-Damages, 1171. 6s.
The rest of the day was occupied with the trial of an action for damages resulting from a collision on the river between a steamer called the Celt and a barge called the Nancy, which latter was run into eaily one mornin5 last November and much damaged.

(Before Sir Joi DonDo-N.
The ADMIRALTY-ADVOCiTE said that this was originally an appeal from the Court of Bath and Wells on behalf of the Archdeacon of Taunton. After hearing counsel the Court of Arches was of opinion that an appeal did not lie to it. Since that the Court of Queen's Bench had put a different construction on the statute, and had issued a mandamus to the Court of Arches, to which he understood it was not the intention of the Court to make any opposition2.
Sir J. DODSON said he had been served with the miandamius two or three days ago, which he had handed to the registrar, and all the necessary steps bad since been taken. The libel of appeal had been admitted, although he thought that the Court of Queen's Bench had no right to order him to receive it. If it had been an allegation, and the Court had rejected articles as informal, the proper remedy would have been to go to the superior court of appeal.
The ADMIRALTY-ADVOCATE.-That order must have been a clerical error. All that he now prayed the Court to do was to hear the case as soon as possible, and on consecutive days.
The learned JUDGE would fix as early a period as be could, so as not to do injustice to other parties,

This insolvent, a young man who had resided at Melbourne, where he was a clerk in Her Majesty's Customs, and subsequently in various parts of the world, and for a short time was clerk in the treasury department of the Customs in London, applied to be discharged.
A creditor named Call opposed in person. He advertised for a situation, and was engaged by the insolvent, who had an office in the city, as a copyist, at 61. a-month. He could not get his salary, and kept a part of a work on which the insolvent was engaged of his travels. The insolvent told him he had drawn his account very closely and promised hin payment. The loss of his salary with a wife and two children was a serious matter to him. He had since obtained a situation at I1. per week.
The insolvent now complained of the inefficiency of the opposing creditor, and denied that he had spoken of a banker's account.
Mr. Call said he had never heard of his inefficiency before.
Mr. Commissioner MURPaY suggested an arrangement.
Mr. LEwis (Lewvis and Lewis) said the insolvent had no means; he had been in prison since July, and came up out of the charitable fund.
Mr. Commissioner MuRPIxY observed that the debts were above 72,0001. on the schedule.
Mr. Ilnvis replied that upwards of wo,oOI. was without value, being for land in Australia. There was a land jobber in the schedule for 30,OOOI. and upwards.
Mr. Commissioner MuRsiiy thought it was a case for the discretionary clause on the complaint of Call. The vesting order was in September, and the judgment would be six months, which would expire in the course of next month.

AfIDDLESEX SESSIONS. F, :datl, FS. 13.
(Beforc dfr. PASHILEY. Q.C., Assieant-Judqc.)
Thomas Cooper, 34, was brought up for judgment. Ie pleaded guilty on a former day of having embezzled three sums of money which be had received on account of Thomas Dawkins, his master, who stated that the t.tal amount which the prisoner had appropriated was abDut 601., ranging over nearly 200 instances of embezzlement, in almost all of which he had committed forgery.
A return of a conviction for felony in IS11 was put in against the prisoner.
The prisoner said he was a mere boy when that conviction took place, and he had ever since earnjed a living honestly. He had worked for one master six years, and for another five years, aU in one firm, and had now a wife and children all dependent upon him for support.
The AssISTANrT-JDaT said, he should not take into consideration the previous conviction, as it was so long ago, but he must regard this as a very serious case. It was one for which but a few years ago his life would have been forfeited, and had the magistrate sent him elsewhere to be tried for forgeryhe must have been convicted of that crime, and, in ad1 probabilty, transported for a considerable number of years. Under the circumstances, he could not pass a more lenient Eentence than four years' penal servitude.
fRobert Grindley, commercial traveller, who was found guilty on Thursday of stealing goods, the property of his master, was sentenced to four years' penal servitude.
Thomas Reed, 20, was indicted for unlawfu3ly assaulting Mary Ann Sweeney, and inflicting upon her grievous bodily harm. He pleaded " Guilty.'
The prosecutrix was the prisoner's mother. She lived at No. 6, Dinah's-buildings, and one night the prisoner took up the poker and was raking out the fire, when she told bsm not to do that. He said he would, and knocked her down by a blow on the head with the poker. He had beaten ber before, for which hohad been sent to prison. He was subject to epileptic fits, and had one while in the dock.
The ASSISTASNT-JUDG sentenced him to six months' hard labour, and said, if ever he came there again on a similar charge the sentence unquestionably would be one of two years' hard labotur.
On one of the juries being discharged, a gentleman who had acted as foreman, addressing his Lordship, said, on the previous evening, as he was going home to Blackwall, he saw some poor boys who were trying to earn a penny honestlv by cleaning boots in the streets driven away by the police They did not belong to the brigade, and while they were driven off the brigade boys were allowed to go on without interruption. He thought it very hard that a boy who was anxious to earn a mite to get a night's shelter or procure a bit of bread should be prevented from doing so bythe police, and he begged permission to mention the matter to his Lordship, as he was sure it was a subjeet which would some daybo brought to his notice in another way-by one of th, poor boys being in the dock.
The As&sTA2qT-JuDGF replied, that what the juryman had said was highly creditable to him, and showed that he had a good and proper feeling for the class of boys he had alluded to. It behoved adl to do their utmost to promote the means privately by which such boys could live honestly, but it was a matter which, sitting there, he could not entertain. A representation of the matter to the chief police authority would no doubt be properly attended to.

Bow-smmr.-An old man, named Thomas Healey, was charged with begging in Pall-mall, using threatening language, and assaulting the police.
As Mr. Barkworth, a gentleman of property and a member of the Reform Club, was leaving that establishment at about half-past 10 o'clock on Thursday night, the prisoner addressed , solicitin alms in the whining tone of the professional beggar. Mr. Barkworth desired him to get away, upon which he became exceedingly abusive, and was only drnven away by the threat of giving him in charge. After going a fevv steps further Mr. Bark-worth turned back and found the prisoner begging of a lady. She declined to
gie him anything, and he began to abuse her in the same TMl language he had used to Mr. Barkworth, and also to threaten her. lr. Barkworth then interfered and gave him in custody to Policeman Reeve, 44 C. The prisoner resisted violently, striking and kicking the constable, who, however, with the help of Mr. Barkwortb, succeeded in getting him to the station. Here he resisted being searched and it took the inspector and two constables to hold him while it was done. Reeve found on him Is. Sd. in copper and a letter of recommendation to St. George's Hospital.
Mr. JARDInE remarked on the extreme impropriety of giving these letters of recommendation to any a plicant without the least inquiry as to character. This wasjthe too general practice, an din many cases they were only obtained in order to be used for the purpose of gulling charitable people. No doubt, this one had been so used by the pnsoner. After remarking on the aggravated nature of the case, Mr. JARDnTE sentenced the prisoner to three months' imprisonment.
M_nYoEBox- A packet of tickets for the Leicestersquare Soup Kitchen has been forwarded to Mr. BRoumiToN for distribution among deserving persons. For the poor-box " A. Z." has sent 21.; and the second half of a 51.-note for the widow AlIsop. 'I G. S. H." has sent five shillings' worth of stamps for the poor-box. Contributions are also sent in for Mrs. Allsop, and among the letters received on Thursday wasone containing a fourpenny piece, the donor sending the amount in the name of ; Prince Albert." Mr. BROUGHTON is making careful and fuU inquiry with regard to the aUegations of the widow, for whom so much sympathyhas ina substantialmanner been shown. The publication of the letter sent by Mr. Phipps in the name of Princ Albert to the widow has, it is behleved, given offence in high quarters; and our reporter has reason to imagine that such is the case, from some observations which were made to him shortly before the rising of the court yhlMr. Broughton. He (the reporter)has doneno more tban his duty in laying the facts which have come under his notce before the cublic;* and should it ultimately turn out that the woman is one to whom relief ought not to be afforded the particulars wil in due course be made known.
WORSP-STREMT.-The magistrate noticed his receipt of the following contributions for the poor-box, the donors of which requested an acknowledgment of them in this paper :-The second half of a 51.-note, No. 04,600, from "M. P. ;" 5s. in stamps, from " J. F. W. ;" the second half of a 61. -note, from " S. G. H. ;" the second half of a 51.-note, from "M. R. E. ;" and a 51.-note, No. 25,139, from " T. A. G." Es. have also been received from the children in an Intant school for the workmen out of employment.
CLXRXHN7ELL.-The sitting magistrate requested our reporter to acknowledge the receipt of the following donations for the poor-box:-" S. E. H. P.," 51.; and
"W. E. W.," 5S.
IaiMrLT-Joseph Simpson, a young fellow well known to the police, was placed at the bar before the Ron. G. C. NORTON for final examination, on a charge of being found on the premises of the London Gas Company, in Vauxhallwalk, breaking into the countinghouse, and also attempting to unlock a safe which contained 8001. in casb.
Mr. Soloman attended for the prosecution, and from his statement and the testimony of the witnesses it appeared that on the morning of Saturday, the 31st of last month, between 2 and 3 o'clock, the prisoner and another man were seen on the premises of the gas factory near the countinghouse, and the prisoner was secured, bat bis companion made his escape. When asked his business on the premises the prisoner at first said that one of his compamons had thrown his hat over the wall, and he had -merely come for it, but at the time he was wearing a cap. He afterwards said he had called to see " Tom Bowling," one of the workmen, but no workman of that name was employed there. On examining the countinghouse it was found that a crowbar or "jemmy" had been used to break the boxes open, and some small cash and about 5s. or 6s. worth of postage stamps were taken. It was also found that efforts had been made to force the iron safe open, and a skeleton key was found in the lock. Had the prisoner and his companion sueceeded in their object in forcing or opening the safe they would have had a good prize, as there was no Iss than 800b in it at the time, 6001. of which were sovereignls.
The prisoner was fuily committed for triaL
At the conclusion of the investigation respecting the death of the unfortunate man named Kieffe Mr. NORTON observed thatthe public were much indebted to Mr. Inspector Silver for the exertion and ability which he had shown in procuring and bringing forward such a body of evidence, and he, MIr. Norton, felt much pleasure in acknowledging those exertions. Seldom has a compliment to a public officer been better deserved, and as it was by accident omitted in the report it may not be out of place now to give it.
The second half of a 5U.-note for the poor-box has been received from " M. P1."1

PARIS, T1URSDAY, FES. 12, 6 P.M.
The remarks of Lord Lyndhurst on the article in the 2lconiteur some days ago, and the admission of Lord Clarendon that he read it with surprise, have revived the interest with which it was originally regarded in this city. The document was a clear and indefensible violation of the engagement agreed to when the organization of the Danibian Principalities was admitted in Congress. It was understood and plainly expressed that the population of those provinces should be called upon to freely set forth their wants and wishes, uninfluenced by anv of the Powers ; and one of the objections to the continued presence of an Austrian army was the impossibility of the Moldo-WaUachians exercising this admitted right while foreign troops occupied their territory. UJnder such circumstances how can we explain the article of the Mor-iteutr ? The union oef the Principalities may or may not be followed by 3dvantages to them; that is as yet a mere matter of speculation; but, so far as can be ascertained, their unioiP is chiefly, if not exclusively, advocated by the revolutionary refugees of 1849; there is no evidence to show that it is the wish of the mass of the people. The union would, in fact, be greatly to the benefit of Russia, who would have 'tnder her control the foreign Prince, whose authority would only be accepted by the Boyards. .Apropos of Russia, the ANord of Brussels, I perceive, gives a flat contradiction to the statement of one of your contemporaries, that that Power had ceased to press the union, and that the change was owing to the influence of M. de Kisseleff, the Russian Ambassador at this Court. Whether Russia has reaUy modified her views in that respect I cannot say; but I do affirm that M. de Kisseleff's opinion is that the union is impossible, except with a foreign Prince, and difficult even with a foreign Prince; and that to place a foreign Sovereign in the Principalities would be an act contrary to the treaty of Paris, by which the integrity of the Ottoman empire has been consolidated, and the srureraiweti of the Sultan in the Danubiai Provinces proclaimed. Such was M. de Kisseleff's expressed opinion no later than eight or ten days ago; and such, I have little doubt, it is at present.
A letter from St. Petersburg of thle 4th, in the Constitutiofn4 says,-
" An additional bond is about to connect Connt do Morny 'with Russia. He is on the eve of purchasing, in the name ,f his wife, a seignorial cstate belonging to the Sevlosky family, situate about 12 miles from St. Petersburg. Ia addition to 2,500 peasants it possesses large hothouses and extensive orangeries."
The same letter says,-
" The weather continues very severe. Yesterday evening the thermometer on the Neva stood at 27 degrees below zero Centigrade (about 171 below of Fahrenlheit). The ice on the river is more than three feet in thickness. Notwithstanding the cold the weatber is very fine. The Emperor xavails himself of it to amuse himself with bear hunting, 'which is his favourite sport."
My private letters from Madrid are of the 7th inst. 'The two points of the moment among those who deviate sometimes into a little serious reflection are the direction of the Northern Railroad where it is to touch France, and the projects of France in Africa. 'With respect to the first, the French Government is making a strenuous effort.-alsnost a formal demand-that the railroad should not take its natural route by San Sebastian, but should pass by Pampeluna and Alduides, where the frontier is quite close. The objections are ostensibly made by the Chamber of Commerce at Bayonne, as if of a purely commercial nature, but the real opposition emanates from Paris, not only for the purpose of coming directly upon a town so strong as the capital of Navarre, but also to prevent, in a military and strategic point of view, the posts of San Sebastian and Passages on the verge of the railroad being held by a maritime Power inimical to France. This concerns England quite as much as it does Spain. There will, in all probability, be a cry in the Cortes against this new line, which is also much more difficult and expensive, the estimate from St. Jean Pied de Port to Bayonne being three times as much as from Iran to the name point. It, moreover, coincides with other objections about the Alduides, in which locality, by the new treaty which has been signed, but not ratified, between Spain and Prance, the French fron-tier has been virtually extended beyond its natural limits, by a clause letting permanently to France for a certain sum a long line of pasturage on the southerr slope of the Pyrenees, extenling towards Pampeluna, and traversed by the projected railway. These facts and coincidences do not pass unnoticed or uncommented upon.
With regard to Africa, all the reports from the Spanish authorities on the Barbary coast, such as 'Ceuta, El Penon, and Melilla, speak of a widelyextended plan and preparations by France for attacking DIorocco at some future period, and establishing even now a base of operations for that purpose whenJever the favourable opportunity may arrive, either in a military point of view in Africa or a political one in Europe.
Aprepos of Africa, the long-talked-of expedition against the Kabyles by the French Government will, it seems, be on a smaller scale than originally intended, on account of the state of the finances and the reductions in the public expenditure. In the meantime Marshal Randon comes to Paris on leave 'of absence.

AUSTRIA.
(FRIOM OUR1 OWN' COIiRPPOINDENT.)
VTENNA, FSB. 20.
A 'few days since you learnt from me that the Emperor had informed lhe Archduchess Sophia that he was so well pleased withl the results of his journey that he was resolved to give Baron Bach some striking proof of his satisfaction. His Majesty has lost no time in patting his design into 'execution, for the electric telegraph yesterday informed the .official world that the Minister of the Interior had xeceived the Granad Cross of St. Stephen, which is the highest civil order in Austria. The possessors of the Grand Cross of St. Stephen have the rigiht to Tequest tbie 'Sovereim-n to raise thlem to the rank of *Counts of the Empire. Nothing positive as to the return of the Emperor and his three Ministers is ns yet known here.
On the2dda,rand dimer was given by the Emperor At Man in honour of the Kingof Bavaria: 14Oguests -were present, and among them were many of the
first 'Lombard noWbes. In the evening the Emperor and his *Royal guest went to the Scala, and were well received; but when the Empress, at a later hiour, -entered the bhx, the cheering of the audience was as vehement as it wua prolonged. It may be remarked that the Emperor and the King of Bavaria speak italias perfectly well; but Her 'Iajesty, who apeaks English as well as if she had been born and educated o2n the other side of the Channel, speaks both French and Italian but indifferently. In a former letter it was observed 'that this Govermnent endeavours to force the Germnan language oa its non-German subjects, and the Augsbs (zdtte has reeeived a letter from the Italian Tyrol which fully confirms my statement. Th e Minister of Public lnstruction has issued orders 'that German is to be the language used in tuition in the higher clases of the gymnasial schools of
T zrent and R overedo, which are quite as much Italian towns as Vicenza or Verona. in future the
students from the Italian Tyrol will not be allowed to Undergo their examinations for their doctor's degree attheUniversityof Innspruckin the Italian lanige It would not be advisable to express such an opinion .here, bt it strike 3 =e that the sooner the idea of
Germanizing the empire is relinquished the better it will be for all parties. There is a very great similarity between Russian and Polish, but still the endeavours of the Emperor Nicholas to force the Poles to learn and speak the Russian language failed. Can it then be expected that the Italians, Magyars, and Slaves will ever adopt a language which has not the least resemblance to their own? Austria is a polyglot empire, and it is labour in vain to attempt to make anything else of it. The Italians in this city have held a meeting, and propose to present an address of thanks to the Emperor on his return from his journey. His Majesty has pardoned 57 felons who were in the Houses of Correction at Milan, Brescia, Como, and Pavia; but it produces an extremely unfavourable unpression on the sensitive Italians to see that political offenders and common criminals are placed on the same level. 24 of the inhabitants of the parishes of Garola, Padiano, and Cremenzano, who oflered opposition to some Gendarmes on the 8th of July, 1865, have been liberated by order of the Emperor. By the wording of the despateh it is to be seen that the unfortunate men in question were, after having been in prison for more than 18 months, still under examination. The Ministerial Oesterreichische Corespoalenz thus announces the evacuation of Parna *.-
On the 5th of February the Austrian garrison battalion went to Piacenza. On the 3dit filed off before the Duchess. The officers, after having had a fareweil audience, dined at the Palace, where there was a ball in the evening. Several of the officers received orders."
On the 5th Baron Hubner called on Count Walewski, and in plain terms told him that he considered the note in the Mrniteur relative to the union of the Danubian Principalities extremely inopportune. It is said that Baron de Bourqueney has given explanations here, but, if so, he has not succeeded in smoothing the ruffled plumes of the Austrian eagle. The language used in official circles is, that the French Government has behaved very like a judge who, after having expressed his own opinion as to the guilt or innocence of a prisoner, should charge the jury to give a dispassionate verdict. It here occurs to me that letters have been received in this city from the Bessarabian frontier, in which it is said that there are such vast masses of snow on the ground that the frontier line can hardly be completed (with the plough) before the end of April or the beginning of May. Things are nearly, if not quite, as bad in Moldavia and Wallachia; and some tradesmen, who have just arrived from Bucharest, speak of 20 degrees of cold according to Reaumur's scale, which is equivalent to 13.00 of Fahrenheit.
The Papal See strongly urges the Grand Duke of Tuscany to conclude a concordat, and reliable news has been received here that there is a question of dismissing M. Baldasseroni and appointing Prince Corsini, who is an Ultramontanist, Minister-President in his stead. If the proposed change should be made, a concordat like the Austrian would, in all probability, be speedily concluded with Rome. Some of the Berlin correspondents write that the Emperor Alexander will visit the Emperor Napoleon in March or April.
THE BALTIC.
(FROMI OUR OWN CORRxzOsrDoWr.)
HAMBURG, FEB. 11.
A rapid thaw having commenced yesterday, and the authorities having assisted the operation by causing the masses of ice to be broken up between this place, Altona, and Neumuhlen, active preparaF tions are in progress by the steamers in port to force
the navigation. The Planet (screw steamer), from London, has arrived, and the Germania (steamer) has made her way down, both of these rival ships having had to remain close to each other, near Altona, for some hours, while trying to make a passage up and down. In a day or two more the navigation will have become less difficult for all classes of steamers, and soon even for sailing ships
Copenhagen accounts are only up to the 7'S inst., leaving two mails due. The Diet was busy with home affairs, and there has been nothing of any political interest to mention. The Loan Bank, established about three years back, with a a capital of 800,000 thalers, has increased its capital to 1,00000, having succeeded well in its operations, and paid 10 per cent. to the shareholders.
A railway is to be laid down from the centre of the city, and to be conducted to the Royal Palace of Friedrichsborg, the favourite pleasure resort for the inhabitants of Copenhagen generally.
The gas and water works are reported as progressing with great activity.
The recently established steam-cooking apparatus, on the principle and according to the model of the one in Hanover, is performing wonders for the benefit of the poorer classes of people in the capital. During the month of January no less than 19,500 allowances were sent to families in the city, and in the saloon of the kitchen 14,368 were consumed.
THE STATE OF NAPLES.
(FROaM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.)
NAPLES, FFB. 9.
It is by no means a solitary opinion that the explosions and other misfortunes which took place in December and January were either procured or taken advantage of by the police to re-establish their ancient power with the Sovereign. At al events they have the power, and according to the wellknown system of procedure in Naples it will produce much wealth to them. Within the last week they have opened some of the cafes which were closed on the 9th and 10th of January, but then they have closed other public places, and, by the e?il eye which they have set upon them, have as good as closed those just opened to aU who were in the habit of frequenting them. Among recent arrests have been two advocates of Salerno an order to that effect having been sent by telegraph and a mere boy of 15 years old, I have been informed, who, on his return from school with his books, had stopped at a billiardroom for his father. Most of those arrested have been let out on the following mornincr, so capricious and without motive has been their detention. In fact, there is not the slightest personal security for any one in the kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Another officer of the 3d Regiment of the Cacciatori, it is said, was sent to Castle St. Elmo on Saturday morning. This is the regiment to which Milano belonged. It is of bad omen that the name of this unhappy man still continues fresh in the memories of the Neapolitans. The following anecdote is related in proof :-Two ladies recently called on the rector of the chureh of the A4scensione and ordered a funeral service to be performed " according to their instructions." The church was prepared with the proper hangings, and not until the service had been said was it discovered that a placard withthese words had been affixedtothe hangingsoutside the door-" Fedeli, pregate per V'anima di Agesilao Milano.' The rector, in great consternation took the placard to the police, and was himnself detained, together with his assistant. I am sorry to say that the impression is very strong that nt only was Milano tortured, but that torture is applied to the prisoners now in confinement. It is said that cries and lamentations are heard at nighit from the prison of St. Mzria Apparente. Of course I cannot vouch for what
z ao nod see, but the evidence addnced ill proof of the truth of these horrible sugpicions appears to be strong. Among other reports is one, wlich says that a domiciliary visit was paid to the house of the son of Prince Satriano a fewdays since, and though the Prince denies it many persons still assert the truth of it. Who, in fact, is safe from suspicion and persecution ? I could mention mnany circumstances to show the growing dissatisfaction of the army with the actual state of things. The following address, which I translate and send, has been circulating among the troops for ceveral days:-
"TO THE TROors %im nix NEIPOLIT.TN Aixv.
" Brothers !-From your ranks has come forth thatbrave man who, in the name of Italy, sacrificed bimself to save the country. You have shown that tyranny can place but little trust in your bayonets. The country is grateful to you for it. Mutius Scevola, who rushed on Porsenna, was not greater than Agesilao Milano. The blow failed in either case; but Porsenna was a noble man, and Ferdinand is a vile one. Porseunr granted Sce,vola his life, and liberated Rome from a siege; Ferdinand, on the contrary, erected a caffold for Milano, mutilated your ranks, and inunda;ted the country with fresh grief. Faithful history leaves it doubtful who was the greater man, Poesenna or Scevola, but no one doubts that Ferdinand Capet is a brutal tyrant. Soldiers !-the warriors of Rome were invincible when they sacrificed themselves

*" TUE ITALtN7s OF T=E Two SrcrunI"
The following official information has been supplied to me, which in strict justice I publish, but with accompanying remarks. A list of 74 persons, with their several sentences, now lies before me, and these are said to have been pardoned within a short time. On the contrary, it is maintained that these 74 persons have been pardoned on paper only; that some are stiU in prison, others in the islands. Another document states that the total number of those who were suffering punishment under condemnation for political offences at the end of 1856 amounted to 654. The correctness of the list is disputed by the opposite party, but, admitting it to be correct, no mention is' made of the far greater number who are suffering punishment uncondemned. There are many such, and it cannot be disputed. It is further added that commissions have been appointed to introduce postal reforms, to examine into the state of the provinces and the mode in which justice is administered there; and that .His Majesty has just ordered a strict and prompt investigation of the mos,t efficacious means for procuring a radical revision of the tariff, a better organization of the Custom-house, and the establishmnent of bonded warehouses. An assurance is also given that a decree will shortly appear on that subject, and to provide for a more liberal organization of stamps and registers. Should suchintentions be carried into effect the advantage to the country will be great, but intentions and promises have been so numerous that they are always regarded with doubt in this country, and especially in the cases here referred to. It is also well known that bonded warehouses and a reform of the tariff have been promised for years, and that, as to the commission for visiting the provinces, it seems for the present to be asleep. At all events, the following statement I believe to be true,-that two of the members of that commission went recently to SignorTroja, President of the Council, and Signor Bianchini, Director of Police, to obtain someinformation as to theirduties;butneither Minister knew anything about them. They then went to the Prefect of Police, and were by hin referred to the King; but they did not obtain an audience; so that this commission is in statu qzo. The official journal of the 5th and 7th inst. labours, though tootransparently, to show that the Royal family are living without any of the precautions said to have been taken. The contrary, I believe, is the fact; the orders given for watching over the neighbourhood of the Palace are of the most stringent character, and no one is received in audience who is not specially sent for. I mentioned that the Malacca had returned from a cruise. The Government evidently had fears of a movement on the occasion, for the commandant of the province, Signor Quintal, had been advised of the anticipated visit, so that when the Malacca hove in sight all were on the qui vive. Patrols were placed along the beach from Salerno to Majuri, and a strict watch kept over suspected persons.
The Osprey, Captain Blomfield, was cruising off Gaeta for two or three days, and returned yesterday morning.
I am sorry to report that Ristori, who performed for the last time on Thursday night in the part of Phadra, fell forwards upon the lamps in the fourth act, and cut and burnt herself most severely. She was to have left for Rome immediately after the performance, but is now detained in Naples. It was the subject of a discussion in the Council whether she was to be permitted to perform Marie Stuart, but His Majesty put his negative on it.
SPAIN.
Letters from Madrid of the 8th inst. announce the sudden death, at Santa Cruz, Tenerfffe, of GeneralDon Agustin Nogueras. TheGeneralbadgained an iuenviable notoriety during the civil war in Spain by having caused the mother of the Carlist Chief Cabrera to be shot. He was Minister of WVar during the government of the Regent. In 1854 he was at Valladolid on half-pay, and contributed with M. Guell y Rente to the Pronunciamientos in that town. The revolutionists chose him for their general, and sent him to Madrid with a division to support the insurrection.
Feld-Marahal Espartero has resigned his seat in the Senate.

The 82d and 90th Regiments, which lately went into garrison at Portsmouth from the camp at Aldershott, and received orders to hold themselves in readiness to embark for India, will not go tntil June. They were yesterday inspected on Southsea-common by Major-General Breton, the Commander-in-Chief of the South-West District, who was much pleased with their efficient appearance.
The Duke of Cambridge has approved the transfer of 438 volunteers from various corps to the 8th, 35th, 53d, 61st, 70th, 78th Highlanders, 83d and 84th Indian depBts at the Provisional Battalion, Chatham. The regiments which have furnished this large number of volunteers are the 4th King's Own; 6th, 14th, 21st Royal Fusileers; 28th, 31st, 65th, 66th, and 67th.
Yesterday an interesting ceremony was performed on the parade-ground of the Marine Barracks, Chatham-the presentation of a silver medal, with a gratuity of 151., vhich had been awarded by the Admiralty, to Colour-Ser. geant Thomas Mortlock, Royal Marines, for long service and meritorious conduct. The battalion having been formed into close column the presentation of the medal was made to Sergeant Mortlock by the commandant of the Chatham division, Colonel E.A. Parker, who expressed the gratification he felt in presenting such a mark of distinction, which could only have been gained by long and meritoriouq service. Colonel Parker having fastened the medal on Sergeant Mortlocl's breast, addressed the troops, informing them that the same reward was open to each of them. Colour-Sergeant Mortlock has been in the service 21 years, during which period he has bome an excellent character. He has been 16 years a non-commissioned officer, and is decorated with the Syrian and also a Turkish medaL

RAILWAY INTELLIGENCE.
GREAT WESTERN.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday at the station, Paddington, Lord Barringtou, M.P., in the chair.
Mr. Saunders, the secretary, read the notice convening the meeting. The report, an abstract of which appeared in The Times of Thursday, was taken as read.
The CHAIRMAN1L said,-With regard to what, no doubt, will be the most prominent subject of to-day's discussion, in consequence of the publicity which, at the request of the Committee of Consultation, has been given, and very properly given, to their proceedings, the necessity is not entailed upon me of going into all theminai(u of the affairs which have been brought before the directors. Statements will, no doubt, be made to you on this occasion, by the members of that committee, and I shall wait patiently to hear what those statements may be. It is always a sad thing that there 8hould exist differences betwveen the proprietors of stock in a railway company and their directors. Nothing, in my opinion, can tend so much to depreciate the value of the property in such undertakings as differences of that nature; and I am sorry that any necessity should have arisen for differences to exist between the shareholders and directors of this comonany. I cannot avoid remarkinr that the time wvhich has been chosen for originating these differences is somewhat odd. Doubtless it is the right and the privilege of the shareholders to make an attack upn the aectors at any tune; but stiU I must say that to select the verymomentwhentheexpenditure of the company was being reduced, and its revenuewas being increased, thoughslowly, yet surely, does seem to be rather an odd time to make, or attempt to make an) alteration in the constitution of the board. (Hear, hear.) Considering what has been done by the directors themselves, I think a little time might have been allowed them to see whether the plan they have adopted would succeed or not. On my own part and on the
art of the whole board I may say that if any proprietor «a anything to suggest for the better govermment of the company the directors will be but too glad to receive it and give it their very best consideration. YVe have fulfilled the promise given by Mr. Walpole last year with regard to our not undertaking anything new without first obtaining your sanction, and I am not aware that there is anything on hand that will caU for an outlay of money. As to the vezata questio, the coal affair, I really must ask whnt possible motive the directors can be supposed to have to encourage a coal traffic-a mineral traffic, except it be for the benefit of the shareholders ? We can have no interest distinct fromyours, but if we can obtain an increased traffic of a better sort of coal it must be so much the better both for the public and yourselves. (Cheers.) With regard to the charges which have been brought against the board of some undue preference being shown to certain parties in the conveyance of coal on the line, I hope the gentlemen who have made such charges against us will feel it to be their duty to bring forward some proof in support of their assertions. (Hear.) I certainly can say on behalf of the board that if anything of the sort can be established it shall be immediately put an end to. (Hear, hear.) We have no wish to encourage one party against another; our sole object is to obtain more traffic, without promoting the particularinterests of any party. I know not whether you have received a copy of a statement which has been forwarded to the directors by a certain number of coal owners in which they allege that undue preference has been shown to parties running their coal trains on the line of the Great Western. Immediately on receiving this statement the directors felt it to be their duty to contradict it by a counterstatement of figures and of facts. I hope most of you have read both statements, and that after calm consideration you have arrived at the conclusion that there is no foundation whatever for the charge. (Hear, hear.) A meeting of the Oxford, Worcester, and Wolverhampton Railway Company took place the other day, at which the chairman stated that there was a debt due by this company to them, the payment of which he had in vain endeavoured to obtain. It is Perfectly true that we do owe that company money, and it is also true that we believe they owe us money, but the matter is now under adjudication before Captain Galton, and when his adjudication is made and the balance struck they will get their money or we shall get our, as the case may be. (Eear, hear.) I have had communications from vanous quaters on the importance of peace being kept with otrer railway companies. The whole world is now, haDpily, at peace, and so, I rejoice to say it, are wec; and I know of no war that is likey to be forced upon us. The chairman of our greatest enemy, if I may so designate the North-Western Company, isperfectly ready to meet me, and Iam ready to meet him, on any little matter of business that may arise, or give occasion to misunderstandings between the two companies. At the present moment we are of opinion that a trifling cause of complaint exists by reason of that company having endeavoured to take from us, contrary to the agreement made between the two companies, a portion of our traffic. It is, however, possible that that company may say the same of us; and all I can say is that I, as your chairman, and Lord Chandos, as their chairman, are ready to meet on the most amicable terms, and with such feelings I trust no misunderstanding may arise between us. (Hear.) With regard to the election of new directors, which is a part of the business of to-day, you will observe that the name of Captain Bulkley is mentioned. He was once a director of this company, and was one of the most active members of the board. He gave up his directorship for the purpose of undertaking other business connected with the company. But, instead of proposing the re-election of that gentleman, we have-and I think you will sayvery properly so-deferred to a wish expressed at various times, that we should infuse more commercial blood into the direction, and have therefore put aside a gentleman who has hitherto served us faithfully, andhave recommended a person of commercial pursuits to your notice. With these few remarks I shall resume my seat, and attend carefully to any observations which may be offered to you by Mr. Miles who, I understand, intends to address the meeting. I shall not on the present occasion move that the report be received and adopted, because many of you, having comne from a distance, may wish to hear what is to be said to-day about the coal affuir beforeyou assent to the adoption of the report. (Hear, hear.) I now invite Mr. Miles to state what ho has to say on that subject. (Cheers.)
Mr. W. MILES, MLP., after expressing the great pain he experienced atfinding himself opposed to the board of directors, with whom it had been his pleasure to coincide on many occasions, and observing that it was no light matter which could break up the amity that had so long existed between him and them, proceeded to state what were the circumstances which led him to believe that the present management of the company was inimical to the interests of the shareholders. It would be remembered that last year two most active members of the board tendered their resignation; and it was the letters which those gentlemen wrote on that occasion which opened his eyes to what be conceived to be the defect of the management of the company. The two gentlemen to whom he referred were Mr. Baker and Mr. Potter, who were selected by the consultation committee as men of mercantile habits and known ability. In a letter dated the 26th ofJanuary, 1856, Mr. Baker expressed an opinion that the duties imposed upon Mr. Saunders, the secretary, were greater than any one man could execute in justice to himself or to the satisfaction of the company, and that, without some change, the interests of the proprietors must severely suffer. This was the cause of Mfr. Baker's resignation. He was of opinion that the directors did not know the details of theirown basiness, but that they saw with the eyes, heard with the ears, and almost spoke with the voico of Mr. Saunders, who united in his own person the anomalous duties of secretary and general manager of the company. (Hear, hear.) Mr. Potter had assigned similar reasons for his resignation. These letters first induced him to feel that a change was necessary if they wished to increase their traffic and modify their expenses. (Hear, hear.) In thereport of last year it was stated that a contract was about to be entered into with a certainj Ruabon Coal Company. It appeared that some of the registered propnetors of that company were the servants of the Great Western Railway Company. How was it possible that they could consistently discharge the duties they owed to the shareholders of the Great Western and at the same time be proprietors of the Ruabon Collieries ? It was said, indeed, that the Ruabon Company guaranteed to add to the income of the Great Western 40,0001. next year, 60,0001. the year after, and 80,0001. in the thirdyear. But he would soon show the fallac of all this. He from the beginning not only questiongi the policy, but the legality of the agreement which had been made with the Ruabon Company. Counsel's opinion had been taken, and the question as to its legality was in favour of the directors, but nothing was said of its impolicy Mr. Gooch, who was at the head of the locomotive department, and to whom was intrusted powers of every descriptiow, was a shareholder in the Ruabon Colliery. ow, who could doubt that Mr. Gooch was human ? and if so, and if Mr. Gooch had a considerable sum vested in the Rnabon Limited Liability Coal Company, would it be anything extraordinary if on some unexpected demand for coal that Mr. Gooch, having the whole command of the locomotive departmaent, should prefer sending all the waggons he could to fetch his own coal to market rather than the coal of those persons who had from the opening of their line made the coal traffic of the Great Western? But, adverting to the report of the deput.ation of share. holders, what was it that they wished? Did they desire a revolution ? Did they wish to usurp the province of the directors? No. Their proposition was that five vacancies should be created in the board, in order that a little more xmercantile blood should be infused into its veins, and that the board should be broken up into committees in order that the detals of the business of the com-
pany shoiuig be better understood by the directors, and
that Mr. Saunders should no longer personate in himself the Great Western Railway Company. (Loud cheers.) Although the directors in their reply to the com-
mittee accused the latter of having come to foregone conclusions without understanding what they were talking about, yet the truth was that they were in constant communication with two of their most practical directors (Mir. Baker and Mr. Potter), and the committee came to no resolution without previously consulting those gentlemen. On the 9th of October a conference took place between the committee and the board, and the former were led to
infer that if they modified their resolutions the board would assent to them. It was at that conference proposed by the committee that Mr. Baker and Mir. Potter should be reintated in the direction, and that the other matters should
e for further consideration. But there seemed to be an insuperable dificulty in the creation of any vacancies in
e board. I thus modifying theirpropositions the comittee certainly could not be accused of evincing any pertinacity in adherng to their first resolutions. The committeo fought notformen, butforprinciDes, and 5r. Bakerand Mr. Potter, havingenunciatedprinciples wbich.tkcommitteebelieved to be the true principles upon which tLe affairs of the company should be conducted, therefore recommended that those gentlemen should be reinstatedin the dirosion. Without entering into details, then, he woald tell 4'e meeting on his own responsibility that every one of the ireragraphs contained in the report of the directors, in reply to the report of the committee, could be completely answemd, and that he could prove to demonusmtion that the committee,
had not asserted one single thiU& or written one cingle ,*ace, whivh wW not ±ru& Xhe loo jeLtesmIa
then referred to a statement which was "aid to have been made by Mr. Atkinson theauditor, to the effect that it was desirabie the South Wales directors should not dit in london, and that be thought the salary of Mr. Brunel Ws too high. (Hear, bear.) But Mr. Atkinson had since been induced to withdraw his vision into the womb of time. (Laughter, and cries of "Time, time ") The hon. gentlenan then read a letter from Mr. Talbot, the chairman of tte South Wales Company, in which he stated it was irmpossible for that company to compete with the Ruabon Crmpany in conseuence oFt the high locomotive charges whicbthe Great Western imposed upon the South Wales coal traffic for haulage. Mr. Talbot had himself expended large sums of money in providing coal waggons for the ser-
vice of the coal traffio on his own line, which he would be i obliged to sell because no profit could, under the arrangement between the Great Wesern and the Ruabon companies, he made by the use of those waggons. The allegations contained in the memorial which had been presented by the coalowners, and which hlad been circulated, at first appeared to him so strong as almost to induce him to doubt whether it could be sustained by proof, but a statement had since been placed in his hands setting forth a series of facts which the memorialists were prepared to establish by indubitable evidence, and, if required, on oath, and which fully confirmed all the allegations contained in their memorial. This was the indictment which the coal proprietors preferred against the Dresent system of management. The hon. gentleman then concluded by moving the foUowing resolution:-
" That. in the opins of this mesting, the present system of manasuneetot the Great Western R&ilway Company is defecuve. ,ad requires amnendment."
(Cheers.)
Mr. Wnmmss seconded the motion; and, having referred to the circumstance which led to the appointment of the committee, proceeded to contend that the first step in the downward course of the railway took place in 1846, when they determined upon the extensions to the north, and every step in that direction had added to their disasters, so that in three years 150,0001. had been taken out of their pockets for the Shrewabury and Cheshire lines. It wasnow said that they must go to Manchester and Liverpool, and when they arrived there they would be told they must go to Edinburgh and Glasgow, so that they could hardly know where their loss occurred. He ha boen slow to believe that Mr. Saunders was the sole manager of the line, athough he bad heard it repeatedly reported, until he had it from Mr. Potter and Mr. Baker-from the board-room itself. He then _proceeded to show from Mr. Baker's letter that in 185n a committee of the directors decided in favour of that gentleman's proposition to formucommittees from the board, but, that the matter being referred to the whole board, it was decided to keep matters as they stood in the hands of Mir. Saunders. Upon this Messrs. Baker and Potter resigned, and their res'gnation was accepted. Prior to the August meeting he (Mr. Withers) met Mr. AtkiDson, one of the auditors, in a railway carriage, when that gentleman told him that the whole management ought to be changed. It was under these circumstances that the committee of shareholders was appointed to confer with the board, but in all their interviewvs with the board they failed to obtain any satisfactory information as to the working of the line, or any modification of the direction. The committee therefore had obtained nothing for the shAreholders, nor would they get anything from the board without they did so by their own votes. Messrs. Baker and Potter did not wish to go back to the board, but it was the committee who wanted to send them back. They were told that they must not enter into discussion with the directors, lest they might affect their property through their bonded debt. Now, their whole bonded debt was only 10,000,0001., while the bondholders had the security of 24,000,0001. of
property; and for the 6O0,0001. per rannum interest, they
dthe secuty of an income of 1,600,0001. So far, then, the bonded debt was in a perfectly safe state as regarded the lenders; but was it satisfactory to the shareholders? LTe said it was not, as out of every 100, borrowed they had to pay 5 per cent. interest upon 401., while in other companies the proportion was only o per cent. on 91. to llt, in every 1001. He thought that not creditable to them, the more especially as they ad a banker at the board-that gentleman being also the banker of the company-a position which no director ought to be allowed to hold. It happened, however, that their neighbours at Euston-square were in the same position; and more curious, too, MTr. Glyn was the partner of Mr. MiUs. (Hear, hear.) Why, they would have thought that that circumstance wonld have maintained peace between the two companies; but, on the contrary, they had been continuaUy fighting, to the injury of the shareholders. With regard to the coal trade, he believed the arrangement with the Buabon ComPany had been honestly entered into with the view of benefitting the traffic of the company, but, seeing the unfortunate position in. which they were placed by it wvith other coalowvners, they ought to remedy it, and he therefore called upon the shareholders to carry the resolution of MIr. Miles.
Mr. NORRIS opposed the motion on the ground that the committee had not carried out the oblect for which they were appointed at the last meeting at BristoL That committee was appointed to consider by what means they could introduce new and commercial blood into the direction. Instead of that, however, they had only recommended the reconstruction of the board by bringing back directors who had been in that board for six years up to Februarylast. In the Eastern Counties Company they had also heard of coal arrangements; but through the application of Messrs. Ransome they had been restrained by the strong arm of the law. Now, those arraugements were entered into by a finance committee, and the board denied their responsibility. He maintained that the secretary should be their chief officer, and should be the organ of communication between the board and the heads of their various departments, and also look after their general business. The committee had admitted that Mr. Saunders was a gentleman of the highest talent and integrity. If ho was so, what reason was there for any alteration of their system? He thought that just as their lines were completed it was a very ill-timed period for endeavouing to change their management. (Mr. Norris proceeded, amid loud cries of '-Time, time " and uproar.) He called attention to the fact, that within the last 12 months they had opened 100 miles of new line, which they had not yet had time to develop. Seeing that their revenue was increasing, while their expenditure was reduced from 43 to 404 per cent., he thought they had every argument for continuing their confidence in the management. Now that all contentions with other companies had been brought to an end, he trusted they would continue their confidence in the board, and their exceUent secretary, Mr. Saunders, whose energy and talent had conduced so much to that end. He begged to move as an amendment,-
"That this meeting, having fuUy considered the respective reports
of the deputation of shareholders and the board of directora, decline to adopt the reconmmendatUon6 of the deputation; that the objects soughlt to be attained to- the deputation were not wouvanted by the terms or their appointment; thuat the reeleetlon or fr. Baker and hfr.
Potr, after they had retired, would wveaken the hoard at atinie when hatmonr was meest necessar in the comipany and that unity of action should prevatL. and the hoard or directors had exercised a sound ludgment in appealing to the shareholders en this subject."
Mr. AVERY seconded the amendment.
Mr. BAKTER expressed his opinion that the mover and seconder of tho amendment did not understand the question. He maintained that in all well-regulated large concerns there was a system of committees. Of course, those committees being formed of members of the board, must be subservient to the whole board. He had the greatest respect and regard for the whole of their officials, especially for Mr. Saunders, who had conducted their business most efficiently and with the greatest talent; but they must remember that no man could live for ever, and they ought not to leave the management of their affairs dependant on the life of one man. When he retired from the board he did so in order to give the proprietors the opportunity of deciding on the propriety of the system of committees. Such committees as there had been in the Great Western ?,ailway had never been properly conducted. The finance committee was a mere audit committee. The whole registration of their stock was in the hands of Mr. WVard, a most honourable officer, without any control over him. Now, with regard to the locomotive department. At Swindon they had 1,800 men, all under the direction of Mr. Gooch, a most excellent and able servant; but, as a proprietor in the coUiery company, it was impossible he could give proper attention to theirbusiness. And, again, though Mr. Gooch was a most excellent loan, it was impossible to say who might be his successor, Though the vanous departments were not under the control of committees, he did not expect they were under the supervision of Mr. Saunders. There was no system of revision whatever. It was now for the shareholders to decide with regard to the future management. If they were content with things as they were, they would support the amendment of Mr. Norris; if not, the motion of Mr. Miles.
A PROPRIETOR said the London coal trade would not pay at the present rates of freight, and therefore they ought to confine themselves to the local coal traffic, which wonld pay.
Major COURT supported the motion, and contended that the directors had acted contrary to law in making any difference in their charges on the coal traffic, either in favour of particular companies or individuals. He read a clause in the act to show that they were bound to charge equal rates per mile overall the lines of the company.
MIr. ATKInso, the auditor, being loudly claUed upon, expressed his opinion that the construction of the board might be amended, and that the system of committees would be advantageous. He was a director of a large company, and bad been so eight years. That company was vworked by commnittees, and during the time aUndedto the dividend had
nsen from 2 to 5 per cent. At the sams time he disapproved the motion of Mr. Miles, and, as the least of two evils, he would prefer keeping the board as it was.
Mr. SAUNDERS rose, anmid loud cheers, to ask of Mr. Atkinson a question personal and of vital consequence to himself. He wished to ask that gentleman whether he had attempted in any vwy to exercise any influence upon him to induce him to withhold any portion of a letter from the committee? Be did not believe that Mr. Atkinson had any desire to attack him, but Mr. Miles had so cleverly introduced a passage from Mr. Atkinson's letter into one of his own as to make it appear that he (Mr. Saunders) had asked Mtr. Atkinson to keep back &_portion of the letter. He declared upon his honour that al he did was to place the letter into Mr. Atkinsor.'s hands, explaining that ord Barrington regretted he could not do so himself, and ask him to put in writing anything he wished to communicateto the directors.
Mr. ATKLNSON had no difficulty in answering the question. Mr. Saunders knew that he had no influence with him, and he had never attempted to exercise any. He had left out the passage of his own accord, and was alone responsible for what he haddone. (Cheers.) With regard to the 3 per cent. dividend, on wbich a question had been put to him by Mhr Miles, there could be no doubt that it had been earned; but he doubted whether it would not have been better policy to declare a smaller dividend, and carry over a Iarger sum to the next halU year, see. t the additional charges that were coming upon the in the course of the next six months.
The CI5AI2WA?, in reply to a question, stated they could not reduce the number of directors at present, as it was fixed byact of Parliament. His general feeling wvas thacomnittees of beards were bound to make their report so a5 to express their own opinions, and not those of the officials.
The question was put, and the show of hanskbeing against the amendment a ballot was demanded.
It wa, anouriced thAt the pQRl would Qmaii .open till
8 o'clock, from 10 to 5 on Saturdavy and foday, and from! 10 to 11 on ruesday, when it would clond.
The report was then adopted, and the dividend declared.
M£r. HLLNS moved for a committee to inquir into thW arrangemenet for the coaL trauic,
Mr. HOYES seconded the motion.
The further consideration of the subject was then postked, ;and the meeting adjourned until 2 o'clock on.
LONDON AND NORTEI-WESTERN.
The directors of this company have just issued their report. It states that the directors have again to report 0,steady increase in every department of traffic. The, usual tabular statemnent of receiptA and expenditure exhibits. for thepast half-year an increase of 15,423& in the receipts for passengers, parcels, mails, &c., and of 45,4561. in the merchandise, making together 60,8791 The increase in the working expenses amounted to 23,2601., leaving the net increase 37,619C The two additional lines, already authorized,
betwoeen Camden station and WiUlesden, have been let undercontract to complete them in nine months from the present time. By the execution of these works not only will the convenience of additional lines for heavy traffic be attained, but the arrangement at the junctions with the North and South Western, West London, And the Hampstexad railways will be much simplified, and the comtunications will be effected withoutinterference with the existing main lines of this company. The directors have had under consideration the best means of obviating the inCreAsing inconvenience experienced in conducting the up-traffic between Rugby and London, caused, in a great measuse, by having to accommodate trains arriving from distant points on other lines, and subject, therefore, to irregularities beyond the control of this company. Many of these trains, especially the mails,. being timed at a rapid speed, any variation in their appointed order not only leads to further delafV passenger trains, but also to frequent and protracted shunting of merchandise and mineral trains, and consequently to, greatly increased expense. After very careful investigation. of the subject the board have come to the unanimous conclusion that the best and most effectual mode of remedying the evil wil be the laying down of a thirdF line from Bletchley to Willesden, where it will join the additional lines Already authorized, and thereby afford relief to the heavy traffic from Bletchley to Camden, leaving the present up line for passenger trains free from obstruction throughout an entire distance of nearly 50 xniles. The cost of completing the proposed third line from. Bletchley to WiUesden, including the necessary alterations of stations and contingencies, is estimated at 350,0001., which sum the directors have every reason to believe will be found sufficient. They recommend that the line between Willesden and Watford, estimated at about a third of the total cost, be forthwith oommenced, so that it may be completed in the course of the present year, and brought into operation simultaneously with the portion between Camden and Willesden Junction. The claims raised by the North Staffordshire Company are stiM undetermined, but counsel are engaged in settling the special case for the consideration of the court. The preparation of the evidence necessary to enable Ir. Gladstone to decide the proportions of traffic to be AUotted to the Great Northern Company on the one part, and to this company, the Midland, and the Manchester Sheffield and Lincolnshire companies on the other, has. hitherto delayed the conclusion of the arbitration; but the directors expect that Mr. Gladstone wiiU be enabled to make his award at an early date. The only measure promoted by this company in the present session of Parliament is a bill introduced, jointly with the Shropshire Union Company, for the conversion of the Shropshire Canal into a railway at an estimated outlay of about 80,0001. In consequence of the high rate of interest which has prevailed for the past fewv years the directors have hitherto deferred making any call upon the 121. 0s. shares, created on the 30th of April, 1853. It will, however, shortly be necessary to do so (the 201. and 101. shares being now fuRy called up); and as it is desirable that the holders should know the dates at whicb these calls wiUl be made the directors have decided that they now be fixed as follows :-first call of 21 10.s. per share, payable July 1, 1857; second ditto, Jtly 1, 1858; 3d ditto, July 1, 1859; final ditto, July L 1860, from which last date these shares wiiU take dividend as ordinarystock. The directors req uest a vote of the proprietors for the works, involving an outlay of 25,3611 The profits oE the half-year exceed those of the corresponding period by 39,9631 10s. 7d., and the directors are therefore enabled to. recommend a dividend at the rate of 51. 10s. per cent, per annum.
NORTH-EASTERN.
The disposable balances on the Berwick and York revenue aecounts, after paying all preferential charges, amounts to 165,3356 and 64,5931. respectively, and the directois recommend that dividends be declared on the Berwick stock and shares at the rate of 4i per cent, per annum, and on the York stock, 3;per cent, per annum, leaving balances of 11,051& and 4,2421. to be carried forward.

Railway Liberality.
RAIL WA Y LIBERALITY.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TLIES.
Sir,-I venture to trespass on your space on behalf of my sister, Rachel Sibley, and infant. The hushand of my unfortunate sister was an engine-driver in the service of the Eastern Counties Railway Company. On the evening of Sunday, the 9th of November, 1856, while driving at a steady rate the tire of the wheel broke-a circumstance over which he could have no control. The result was an accident which caused the death of my unfortunate brother-in-law in the most horrible manner. The deceased had been married about 14 months, and at the time of this sad occurrence his widow wvas hourly expecting her confinement. The deceaed was a man remarkable for his steady habits, as was testified by the railway officials at the inquest in the strongest terms.
An application wa made to the directors of the Eastern, Counties Railway on behalf of the widow and child of the man who had lost his life in their service. It was entertained, and the sum of 5U. as a first and last gift to the unhappy widow was the result. The poor woman is entirely destitute. As a contrast to the railway directors' liberality, I may mention that the widow was surprised at receiving a check for 31. from the Baroness Meyer de Rothschild, entirely unsolicited. I take the liberty of asking you to insert this, as an imapression exists among many persons that provision has eenor illbe adeby he directors for the widow.
Your insertion of this may possibly cause a reconsiderahion of this matter by the Eastern Counties directors, to the benefit of the poor widow and child.
I am. Sir. vour verv humble servant.
- SAMUEL CLARKE.

RAILWAY ACCIDENTS.-During the half-year ended
RAILwAY ACCIDEINTS.-During the half-yearended
the 31st of December, 1856, there were 37 accidents to JIMenger trains and 6 to goods and mineral trains in England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, making a total of 43. 7 passengers were killed and 224 injured, and 16 servants of the companies killed xnd 33 injured; making a total of 23 persons klfled and 257 injured. Of the 43 accidents 24 arose from collisions of all kinds, 3 from the trains ranning into sidings or off their own lines, 10 from trains getting off the rails, 4 from breakage of axles and couplings, 1 from the bursting of a boiler, and 1 from a train running into a station at full speed. The total number of accidents to servants of companies, contractors, and labourers amounted for the half-year to 75 killed and 51 injured. 19 were killed and 36 in<jured from causes beyond their control, and 56 killed and 15 injured from want of caution or miseonduct; 4 engine-driverswerekilled and llhurt, 14 firemen kiled and 7 hurt, 6 guards kiUed and 12 hurt, 13 porters kiUed and 4 hurt, 2 policemen killed, 4 gatemen and signalmen kIlled and 1 hurt, 3 switchmen killed, 6 platelayers killed and 5 hurt, 12 labourers IdLed and 5 hurt, snd tl miscellaneous persons killed and 6 hurt. These accidents occurred on all lines open for traffic in the nnited kingdom.
THE PrrcAiIN ISLAXDERS.-A correspondence on the subject of the removal of the inhabitants of Piteairn's Island to Norfolk Island was published yesterday. It was suggested by Sir J. Pakington, then Home Secretary, in December, 1852, that Norfolk Island was a fit place for the reception of the inhabitants of Pitcairn's Island, and Lieutenant Governor Sir W. Denison wvas ordered to reort. The islanders were eventually removed from Pitoairn s to Norfolk Island, "with much success and in good order," in the course of lastyear, at an estimated expense of 5,5M. The connexion of Yitcairn's Island with English history and literatare (the MAtiny of the Bounty, and Byron's poem of 2Tc Island) is well known to persons of education. It ap. pears that the islanders were remarkable for their innocenco of life and gentleness of mainers, and that they were, so to speak, starved out of Pitcairn's Island, they having outgrown its capability to afford them the means of sustenance. Al the convicts were ordered to be cleared off from Norfolk Island prior to the arrival of this new and innocent colony. The islanders were 190 in number; they had never cost the British Treasury anything, and had ever been loyal subiects of the Crown. They are very happy in their now abode.
Trsn PEESIDENT ELECT AT WASHIINaTON.-Governor Wise to-day called on Mr. Buchanan and had quite a protracted interview. How the Virginia imbroglio is to be settled no one as yet knows, but it is believed Governor Wiu will carry his point. kessrs. Hunter and Mason called on Mr. Buchanan soon after his arrival, aLnd of course were wldl recived. All of the small fry editors from the Old Domin7o;n-among them Messrs. Bans and Pryor-are here trying to effect something; but so fai y have failed
and on two or three occasions been snubbed- The friends of Daniel S. Dickinson to-day had a hearing before Old Buck. It appears that they are desirons of knowing what positioru or relationhoisto holdtowardsthein-coming Administration The grand dinner party at the President's to-day wLas largel7 attended by the leading democrats, General Cass presiding at the foot of the table. Mr. Buchanan was, ofcourse, the great luminary. Among the lesser lights3
notioed President Pierce, Messrs. Gethri~e Marcy, Campbell, Cushinlg, Cobb, Falkner, Wise, Toucey, Rusk, Savae, and many others. Everything was discussed but the in-coming Administration, though several witty allusioni were made to Mr. Buchanan's contemplated change of residence, and hopes expressed that he would soon kter itros djeeYXXT, B, to his friends.-NCW York-gc44,
