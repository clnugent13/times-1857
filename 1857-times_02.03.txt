Colonel Tulloch's Review Of The "Chelsea" Report.*
COLOEL -TULLOCH'S BEVIEW OF TEE
"CHELSEA" REPTOR.* - I
The volume of Colonel Tulloch, referred to in the correspondence which we published on Wednesday, the 28th ult., is now before us, and we at once imvite the attention of every Englishman to its exposure of the illusory inquiry at Chelsea. The report of the Chelsea Board has been hitherto received with that vague but justifiable distrust which its constitution and mode of procedure inspired. The Crimean Commissioners cn:ld not be expected to recognize the authority of its verdict, and accordingly Sir John M= 4eil, beinzunconnected with the military profession dec de altogether to appear before it. But Colonel Tulloch, though sharing his colleague's objections, hadnot the sameoption. As a soldier he was bound to defer to a body appointed by the General Commanding-inChief, and in consequence of the imputation of uaworthy motives made against him by Lord Lucan he was forced to present himself before the Board in his own defence. His appearance was, however, to little purpose, for on the 5th of May he was suddenly prostrated by severe illness, and was obliged to retire andleave allfurtherproceedingsunchecked. The result thereforecorresponded withthe antecedent probabilities The Board had no local experience of the Crimea, for not one of the seven members com-
sing it had ever been there. These members had enarbitrarilyselected, andwere "all of onepolitical bias." In answer to Lord Lucan, even the JudgeAdvocate-General observed that "the noble lord's judges, they who tried him and who judged and acquitted him, were aU his own political partisans." The Board was thus destitute of even the semblance of fainess in its constitution as well as of the qualification of local knowledge. Not only had they none of them vsited the Crimea, but they entered on their functions without making arrangements to bring home those witnesses from the Crimea on whose statements the report of the Commissioners had been founded. The officers who complained of animadversions in their report had, however, every facility in this respect extended to them at the expense of the publie, while no steps were taken to insure any similar advantage to the Commissioners, who were treated as if it was they who were on their trial, with the exception of the fair protection which justice ordinarily aftfords to the accused. The first official intimation of the existence of the Board eceived by the latter was from Mr. Peel, dated the 4th of April, 185S, and informing them that the Boardwould commence proceedings on the 7th of the same month. These gentlemen were notinforiied inreasonable time of theanimaadversions complained of, that they might be prepared with evidence to establish their statements; but in the cases of Sir Richard Airey and Colonel Gordon all information of this kind was withheld, and " up to the very hour when these offlcers opened their cases not the slightest hint had been conveyed to either of the Commissioners of the parts of the report intended to be assailed, or whetherobjectionswere to be raised at alL" AlImost every witness was directly or indirectly interested in discrediting the statements of the Commissioners; yet, sufficient care was not taken to sift their evidence thoroughly, while their evidence, moreover,was not given upon oath. That the report which the Board drew up, as the conclusion of such loose proceedings, was most unjust to Sir John M?Neil and Colonel Tulloch-that it was unduly favourable to those whom they had censured-that it was generally wzrong in its facts and mistaken in its inferences-that " it pre-
sents features of so extraordinary a character as to deserve the serious consideration of every one who wishes well to the profession of arms, or is interested in the reputation of those who belong to W'-that it involves larger consequences to the interests of the nation and the credit of its Government-and that the Commissioners are now about to raise all these questions by this appeal to the common sense and public opinion of the country, was no more than we ourselves alticipated or than our public men must presently prepare for. The report of the Board, after this searching exposure, is in effect just so much waste paper. Its members are now put on their defence bythose whose work they professed to review, and we may wish them in turn " a clear deliverance," without perceiving that a deliverance is possible. At the same time that their case is apparently hopeless the issue has expanded into a popular question. If the Board of General Officers gravely arrived at the conclusion that the frightful calamities which befell us in the Crimea were "solely attributable to the want of pressed hay from England," what security have we, asks Colonel Tulloch, that such frightful calamities may not occur again ?
"Whether such a conclusion is warranted by the evidence, and whether hay would have supplied the men with fresh meat; recovered the clothing lying useless in their squad bags and knapsacks- provided fresh bread and supplied lime-juice and medicmne for the 5ick; roasted green coffee for the healthy- and secured shelter for the horses which perised, because nothing wa done in one brigade at least for their protection, the pubhe will now be able to decide for themselves. I can only say (says Colonel Tulloch) that I would prefer such a conclusion being promulgated to the world under the authority of seven General officers, rather than by any statement of my colleague and myself."
The Commissioners are now able to maintain their view of the question without the least occasion for reserve. At the tine they issued their Reports they laboured under the very serious disadvantage that while their conclusions and deductions were published the facts on which these had been founded were only partially made known. Inquiry had been made into the extent of the sickness and mortality during the previous winter, and as to the diseases which occasioned it, but it was thought objectionable to publish such facts while the war continued and every exertion was still re uisite to recruit the army to its full establishment. At that time, therefore, at a considerable disadvantage, they restricted themselves to a mere statement of the total loss, but important particulars are now forthcoming, of which Colonel Tulloch gives a valuable analysis, which we shall quote on another occasion, before we close our account of his volume. This analysis collects the whole of the inquiries into a single question, but on the present we take the Coloners observations in their order, and abstract first his remarks on the case of Lieutenant-General TnB EARi OF LUcAN.
The first question with respect to this officer is not of extreme importance. Were the calculations of the Commissioners with respect to the deaths of the cavalry horses accurate or inaccurate? The Board has admitted that their figures were " perfectly accurate," but it differed as to the best mode of calculating percentages of mortality. On this point Colonel Tulloch offered to refer them to the calculations of Dr. Farr, probably the best qualified person in the kingdom to offer an opinion, but " they neither availed themselves of that source of information nor inserted in their report a letter from that gentleman, confirmatory of the calculations objected to by them." In the second place, the Board declared any comparison of deaths between the cavalry and commissariat animals impossible, on the ground of the difficulties of ascertaining the periods at which the latter arrived in the Crimea, so that the difference of 38 per cent. as against the former, on which the Commissioners had laid stress, was excluded from consideration. To this Colonel Tulloch replies that a fair ap-
proxnmation to the dates of arrival of most of the baggage animals might have been obtained, and, had the Board assumed even the whole number unaccounted for as deaths, they would have found the loss not to have equalled that sustained by the cavalry.
But the above questions are merely subservient to the more definite and important question-how the horses died, and why they died-on which subject the Colonel confutes Lord Lucan from his own Divisional Order. This order was dated January 20, 1855; it was passed unnoticed by the Board, and was never communicated to the Commissioners till the proceedings of the Board were made public. The seven Generals had it before them for several months, yet not one of them thought of asking Lord Lucan how he reconciled the assertion that the Commissioners' report in this respect was prompted by "malice and malignity," and was " totally at variance with the fact and the truthW" when in censuring the " want of* promptitude" in devising shelter for the horses they were much within the mark of his own official declaration. Before the Board he pledged himself to remove "the slightest breath of reproach" from "chimsf

and the cavalry ;" he was "prepared to show that every endcavour, very strain, and everyoting on tarth that conld be done to promote and hasten the build. ing of the stable3 was done; that not azn hour was 4st, &c., and he was "prepared to show, by his orders, for he had nxo other means of proof, that so far from the stables not having been commenced til the end of January, they were nearly completed by that time." With these profuse engagements his own divisional order, left in the appendix of the Board's proceedings, and by the Board unnoticed, is now, for the first time, contrasted by Colonel Tulloch. It is dated, as we observed, as late as the 20th of January, and is thus emphatic -
" The Lientenant-General is sorry to observe that in the Light Brigade no exertion whatever-not even an attempt kasoeen rd to put any of the horses under cover, a fact not creditable to commandting officers. They ahould have shown some desire to save the few Utat remain; and as the disproportion between men and horses is, in this brigade, far more favourable than in the Heavy Brigade, it is im-
tossibte to e zp&u far Icss to justify, why, while the one origade has hutted more than one-half their horses, the cornmanding of ficers of the Light Brigade have done ootmn-. Each o£ theae commaxnding offlcers will be good enough to report daily how manyJ dipable men he had the day previous, and what progress they have made."
Even so late as the 7th of February, within a week of the period when his Lordship gave up the command, another divisional order shows that a slight " breath of reproach" might still attach to himself or some other member ot the Cavalry .
"While the Lienlenant.General yesterday was much pleased by finding the whole ol the horses of the 4th Drapoon Guards under corer, well groomed, and writh horse clothing clean and in repair, he ws as much displeased with the-, wrho,with honse-room at their command, positively had their horses exposed to thc wecather; the horses were encrusted with mud and dirt "J and again, " but fewv horses had clothing at all, end that clothing in filth and ragF Lord Lucan scarcely erer visited a camp writh less satisfac-
Thus the discredit of Lord Lucan is transferred to the Board wrho listened to his reclamnations against the Commissioners, for repeating in modified terms wvhat had been expressed in the strongest possibIe language by himself, and who yet passed unnoticed the official docamenta under his own hand expressly contradicting his own repeated and most emphatc assertions.
The Board, it seems, p referred to refer the loss of horses to " delays and difficulties" and to a want of " inteenchingtools,"which,with other impediments, Colonel Tulloch alows also, from Lord Lucan's orders, to have been mainly imaginary. Sailcloth to afford the horses temporary shelter, he contends, apparently on satisfactory grounds, might have been procured either from the fleet, from the transports, or from Constantinople. In answer to the objections to its use he refers to Aldershott, where it has since been extensively used without the consequences apprehended by Lord Lucan and some of his witnesses. He contends that to placethe horses inl pits wzas not, as Lord Lucan contended, to consign them to "'graves" in the event, which did not soeem to occur to hns Lordship, of the pit floors being dloped to render their drainage effectual. HIe quotes a recent case where shelter was completely obtained by this means in a few hours ag,ainst a four days' storm by the French cavalry in Algeria, and makes the observation which was reaUly necessary to remove Lord Lucan's difficulty, " that in the Crimea, as well as in Algeria, water usaUy finds its level," and, " with every respect for his Lordship's testimony and the soundness of his opinion, both must be doubted when opposed to the laws of nature."
The conclusion of the Board that no officers were influenced by the threat alleged to have been ad-
desdby Lord Lucan to Colonel Griffith is, as Colonel TuUocch remarks, " exceedingly difficult of proof," so we pass by this and all other considerations relating to Lord Lucan, to do justice to his cavalry subordinate, Major-General the Earl of CsiurcIau. The grievance of his Lordship ap~pears to have consisted in the presumed imputa-. tion thuat he was responsible for the starvation of the horses of the Light Cavalry Brigade, the circumstances of which exploit were detailed by the Coin missioners. To repeat them in the most sunmmary fashion, the circumstances were as follows :-The brigade was removed to Inkermann on the 1st or 2d of November, a distance of seven or eight miles from Balaklava. Up to the 14th of November the Commissariat could bring up but little hay, and after that date the supply failed entirely. Barley was to be had, but with the means of transport at the disposal of the Commissariat enough only could be broughtup to afford il1b. to 2tb. daily to each horse. The Commissariat officer proposed that a detachment of the horsesshouldbeallowed to go down daily, upon which he rwould engage to bring up enough for the rest of the brigade; but LordCardigan declined to nocede to this for reasons which are not specified. On the 2d of December the brigade was directed to retarn to iht previous position, but by that time the horses were reduced to such a state from starvation that they could no longer hear the weight of their riders; they had to be led dowvn; many were left on the ground in a dying state, and of the remainder 17 died on the road before they could reach their tformer station, a ditance of only about six miles. The question raised by Lord Cadigan and avoided by the Board is now completely met by Colonel tlloch . Did tho means exist within his Lordship's reach of feeding and saving these unEortunate animals?t
There is no evidence to show that Lord Raglan's attention was called to the proposal of the Commist officer, so that the responsibility of rejecting it cannot be imputed to him. The exhibition of an array of cavalry may, indeed, have been made in submission to his orders, but to ascertain the turning point of the question, we should mark the numerical difference for which a brigade of real cavalry was recklessly converted into a Brigade of SpeCtres. The Assistant.Oommissary-Gneral Crookashank stated that the number of animals required to carry up the full allowance of barley to the brigade would have been 63. Of these about the 18th of ,ovember he had 35, but later only 10. The board appears to have ignored the fact that Lord Cordigan was only asked to saupply the difference and accepted his loose statement, for which there is "not the shadowv of a reason," that so many as 120 horses must necessarily have been taken from his effective force for this purpose. It appears, indeed, that at the latter end of November he had 330 horses to 286 men, and, as the Commissariat required not men but horses, the 44 horses in excessc of riders had only to be placed at their disposal with a few dragoons to protect them from ill-usage, and every difficulty might have been overcome. Forty-four, or say 60, horses would almost have met the requirement in its heaviest form, for, considering wvhat the infantry were doing, it was not too much to expect that the men detached with the horses should walk and lead them. Lord Cardigan might have had some difficulty in carrying Up aJ, the barley-about half the difliculty which he himself alleged-but this was by no means required at his hands. He might hav carried up the required proportion of barley easily, but the question is, with the resources at his disposal, was he justiied in carrying up noneI whatever?f
The Board held that his refuel was supported by theabsenceof hay at Balaklavne its sages not observingthat it was barley wluch was in question, the food on which horses could be maintained for a limited period with least difficulty as to transport, and of which " there was plenty." This shameful piece of confusion was the Board's contribution to the question.
About midway between Balaklava and the Light Brigade it is material to add that the Heavy Brigade was posted, numbering from 800 to 900 men and horses, yet no application was made by Lord Cardigan for their assistance. And why twt ? The board did not inquire, or it might have ascertained how far Lord Lucan could have afforded such assistance. A fortnight after the starvation of the Light Cavalry he was able from a diminished force to spare 494 horses, and half that number of men daily, to carry up provisiom to the infantry; and can we believe that none could be spared for the salvation of the Light Brigade at so momentous a crisis? There was no unusual amount of sickness either of men or horses; then what rendered it "quite enough for the Heavy Brigade to forage for themselves ?" Colonel Tulloch could not ascertain this, for he was precluded by previous arrangement from directing any questions himself upon this san lject. But where` fore was the Board content not to ask for an explanation on which the inculpation or exculpation of Lord Lucan, or Lord Cardigan, or of both, mainly depended?
"Unhappily," says Colonel Tulloch, "'there was but too much reason to fear, from the official correspondence of these noblemen,thattherehadnotbeenbetuveenthemthatcordiality of feeling which is essential to effettive co-operation I the field, and it was batjust, by a rigid inquiry, to have afforded them an opportunity of showing that their private feelings towards eachqther hadl not been allowed to operate to the prejudice of the public interests, and that the starvation of the Light Cavalry Brigade coild in no respect bave been attributable to the one of these officers having leea too
.-
proud to &Ak ald tbe other too hostile to offer assistanoe in so dire an czergency.'
These noblemen we.re .concerned, and Utey are oncened stil, in completing this inqutiry and affording this explanation. The nation also had, and continues to have, some interest in receiving it. Then, why was it disappuinted? Wtere the" seven'> of Chelsea simply iucompetent, or were their instructions, " that the trnth should be made manifest, and that justice should be done to all parties," an official pretence to which they responded by an accommodating sbam ?

Money-Market and City Intelligence.

,MONEYm4REB,,"Lasa
Monday Evening.
The English funds havebeen less unsteadyto-day, but the market remains without any sign of animation. Consola for money opened at 93-the closing price of Saturday-and, ifter standing for some time at92J to 93, they recoveredto 93 to i, and continued without further alteration. For the 5th of March the last trauAetions were at 93i to J. The business of t-e day wan uniunortant. Bank Stock left off
Cnto. 2i8; Reduc 9S to J; New Three p~er Gets,93+to J; Ii -tock, 218 to 220; Exchequer-bonds, 9§ to }; and India Bonds and Exitequer-bills, 3sa dsount to par.
In the Stock-Exchange to-day there was a better aupply of money, and towards the close the rate for loans on Government securities was about 6 per cent. In the discount-market also there was less pressure, but the applications at the Bank were stiUl very numerous.
I oreign securities have been steady, and late in the afternoon they showed a tendency to improvement. Turkish Sim per Cents. for money were segotiated at 93i, and for the account at 93, 92k, 93#, and 93k. In the Four per Cents. Guaranteed trasactions for the account took place at 100g. The general business comprised-Ecuador, New Consolidated, 14k; Guatemala, 58; Mexican for accdunt, 21a and i; Portuuese Three per Cents., 44;' Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents, 96; Spanish New Deferred, for account, 231 and ; Sipanish Certificates, O, i, i, and i per cent.; 'Venezuela, for money and account, 37r; the Deferred, 15 and 15k; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 98, 98p, and B0
The corn-mnarket was dull this morning, but sales were effected at rather higher prices thaz on Monday-last.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. this evening were 68f. 15c. for money, and 68f. Sc. for the present settlement, showing a further recovery of morm than three-eighths per cent. At Vienna lkewise there has been increased firnmess. At Hamburg the rate of discount has declined to 6 per cent.
The letters from Paris to-day state that the visit of M. Mirea to London, with the view of negotiatng :a settlement with the holders of Spanis conflicated coupons, is deferred for a few days pending a correspondence with Madrid. The general terms for the fornation of the proposed International Bank, to be carried on upon the principle of the English joint-stock banks, are stated to have been arra,nged, but not the details. The capital will be large, and also the amount of each sbare, but the precise figures contemplated are still subject to alteration.
A' further sum of 17,0001. was taken from the Bank to-day for exportation.
The Alhambra, from the Peninsula, has brought 38,6351. in specie.
The advices from Panama to-day state that Her Majesty's ship Trincomalee was daily expected at that port with a large freight of silver from the western coast of Mexico, which will probably be brought to Southampton by the next West India steamer (the Magdalena), due about the 17th inst.
it is now estimated that the Peninsular and Oriental steamer Ripon will take out specie on the 4th to the amount of about 94 00001. Of this only 30,0001. wil be gold, the rest being silver-about 760,000l. for India, and 150,0001. for China.
The trade reports from the manufacturing towns for the past week contain little of importance, but, with the exception of the Manchester markets, the general tendency has still been towards increased employment and higher prices. The heaviness in cotton goods is chiefly consequent upon the caution induced by the uncertainty regarding the raw material. At Birmingham the deniand for iron is wel maintained, and, with respect to the general occupations of the place, the only drawback appears to consist in the constant rise in copper and other metals. The Nottingham advices describe an animated colonial and home demand for hosiery, while the lace trade is also active. Many new factories are in course of construction, and there is a great scarcity of hands. In the woollen districts the home and export demand has been equally good, stocks are low, and employment general. In the Irish linen-markets there has been a fiul business, in some instances at improved prices.
The intelligence from Melbourne td Panama is to tbe 31st of October, or a week later than that by the overland mail. The gold production had revived with the return of fine weather, and there was a steady demand for imported goods at remunerative prices, which would have been still better but for the accounts received of the consignments to be made from this side in July last. The totals of gold brought by the last escort were 46,030 ounces and 27,6741. coin. For the 10 months of 1856 the receipts had been 8,560,0001. against 7,070,0001. in the corresponding period of 1855, while the shipments had been 9,530,0001. against 8 620,0001. The great increase occurred at tle beginning of the year, th'e total for the last quarter, owing to the state of the weather, having shown a slight reduction. Shipments it was noW expected would again steadily increase. The elections for the Victoria Parliament were nearly complete, and the Government party were likely to have a strong majority. From Sydney the dates were to the 25th of October. With regard to the recently discovered goldlield at Dunolly, near the Rock Rver, it is mentioned that about 20,000 persons were stil at work there out of the rush of 40,000 which had first taken place. It may be assumed, therefore, that although every exaggerated expectation had not been realized, the yield was not unsatisfactory. A new rush had lately taken place to a locality on the Government lands called Epsom.
The following letter describes very accurately the effect of the Indian railway works in aggravating the steady drain of specie to that country, but the writer is in error in supposing that the subject has not received ample attention. Of course the first results of these undertakings are just the same as would have arisen if they had been contracted for in France, Russia, or any other foreign country, and hence it is essential that the India directors, however much they may desire to promote the improvement of India, should be careful to prescribe certain limits within which the annual outlay may be confined. Not only is this necessary for the financial convenience of England, but also to prevent wasteful expenditure on the works themselves by the increased charges for freight, &c., consequent on a too pressing demand for iron and other materials. Many persons who are interested in the extension of these enterprises endeavour to spread an idea that, as the largest proportion of their cost is laid out In this country, the drain of capital in connexion with them is to that extent lessened, but the fallacy, as the present writer observes, is obvious, since if we send iron, &c., to India we have the less to export to other countries, and must supply the deficiency by specie. It is to be hoped, therefore, that the India-house will forthlwith franme some general plans with respect to the amounts they wfll allow to be expended from time to time. The objects to be attained are of such impOrtance that a considerable total may be satisfactorily devoted to them; but, as al the schemes of the various *projectors who are likely to choose this field for their operations would1 if admitted, be sufficient to absorb ten times the capital at our disposal, it is only the most urgent that should receive attention. The points of our Eastern territory which it would be desirable and profitable to open 1)
If we bad but the means to do everythingat once, are so numerous that it seems as if every offler or merehant now returning from India considered it indispensable to bring a railway or steamboat proposal in his pocket. Indeed, such is their haste crudely to anticipate each other, and the certainty they respectively express of Eecuring the patronage and guarantee of the Government, that the public already finds it diffieult toweigh their several claims.
The only cure for thls system will be for the IndiahouEe to decide promptly as to the undertalkings they consider entitled to precedence, and then to announce that for a period of two or three years no further applVtions ill be entertained -
" Sir,-I am nduced to ask you to publish the followoinobservations on a subject which does not appear to have yet attracted the attention its importance seems to me to merit
as one of the elements affecting the continued stringency of our money-market-I allude to Indian railways.
"It is well known that the home expenditure of the Indian Government amounts to about 4,000,0001. sterling annually, and that until within the last four or five years this sunL was proyided by Wale of the draughts of the Company on the IndiA trearies at a rate of exchage flue.
tuatig with the exienie o the trsuy of the Indiahouse, and according to the demand experieneed for such dratghts. The draughtss were purchased almost wholly by the ommnerial public, who remitted them to their correspondents in Indiato phc Ihem in funds for the purchase oftproduce, and in the due course of trade vaue wras
retured to this 6ountry in prodnme for such draughts. within 12 months. Thm the fi_p sI, qperation4 of the,
ast Indiu C(ompany and the coimetsii communiwroTk6d in aercrle;and to actukl w dithdtWI 6f cXapitd fromthis country tookplace.
"The case is now very much altered,; by the arrangement entesed igto by the East India Company with the railway companies all the capital required tor the construction of - their respectve lines ispaid into the Cotnpany"s treasury here, iLnd the Indian Governments disburse the equivalent as called for during the process of construction, which is placed to the debit of the railway companies at the exchange of ls. 10d. per rupee-an advantageous rate fQr them, it may be obserred, the East India Compiny's commbercial rate of exchange being 2a. Od. on Bengal, and 2s. Id. on Bombay.
" A considerable portion of the annual sum required for the home payments at the India-house is, however2 provided from this source, and it follows that, requiring to issue draughts for so much less, the EaIndia Ompany are enabled to fix a rate of exchange for their driughts wbich makes it more advantageous for the merchint to export bullion than to purchase them; hence arises the more extensive demand for bullion shipments to India.
" It will be observed that the remarks already offered have reference to that portion of therailway capital only which may be expended in the coW of labour and such part of the materal as may be provided in Indis- but I Would further notice that the balance is represeuted by the cost of permanent-way material, rolling stock, kc., exported hence, and for which England receives nothing in return. Cohsequently, the whole cost of Indian railwajs wll be an abolute withdrawal of so much capital from this country, and if we add to this amount that requieid for the balance of trade, now much against us, it must I thnk, be adiitted that our Indian dominions are absorbing, and are likel7 to tontinue to absorb, annualy an amount of capital quite large enough to exercise very eonaiderable disturbance on the state of our home resourcea, although indeed to be cort rected hereafter by a tribute in the form of current profit
According to the circular of M. Arles Dufour, the silk-market of Lyons during the past month haa shown undiminished activity. The stock, already verv small, has been much reduced, and prices have again advanced. The belief was that no relaxation could be expected until the apprehensions hall have been removed of another pos8ible failure of the European crop.
The departures from the port of London for the Australian colonies during the past week have comprised four vessels-two to Sydney, one to Port Phillip, and one to Geelong, with an aggregate capacity of 3,467 tons. The rates of freight generally exhibit heaviness.
ln the general businesa of the port of London duinDg the past week there has been a considerable falling off in the arrivals. The umuber of vesels reported inwvard was 109, being 45 less than in the prevnous week. The total number of ships cleared outward was 101, showing an increase of 16. The number on the berth loading for the Australian colonies is 68, being threemore than at the last aecount. Of these nine are for Adelaide, five for Geelong, four for Hobart Town, three for Iaunceston, three for Melbourne, three for New Zealand, 21 for Port Phillip, one for Portland Bay, 17 for Sydney, one for Swan River, and one for Wellington.
The following notice respecting steam communication with China has been issaed by the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Company:-
"Referring to their circular of the 10th of September, the directors have to announce their intention of running steamers between Bombay and Hongkong with branch steamers to Shangbai, in correspondence with the departures of the 20th of the month from Southampton outwards, and of the 9th of the month from Calcutta homewards. This extra service will commence with the steamer leaving Southampton on the 20th of Warch, and be continued monthly until further notice."
Advices from Vigo regarding the Brazil mailsteamer Tamnar, which was obliged to put Into that port forrepairs, state that her rudder had been
tted, and that it was hoped she would proceed on her voyage to Brazil, tid Lisben, on the following day.
At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day the exatnina,tion of Messrs. Syers, Walker, and Co., who failed in the Tndia trade on the 4th of April last, with debts for 146,0001., was adjourned. The balancesheet has been prepared, but, under the advice of the official assignee, it has not been filed, accounts continuing to be received which alter the position of the estate. About 7,0001. or 8,0001. are in hand, and a hope is expressed that a dividend of about 2s. in the pound may at the expiration of two months be declared.
The annexed is from the United Mexican Mining Company:-
" Jesus Maria y Jose.-I have again the satisaction to report very favourably of this mine. I have before informed you of the gradual iprovement apparent as the vein be. came more distincUy defined and more separated from the original vein, which it crosses, and I found yesterday that the work which has been advanced the furthest (the frente of San Maximo), and which is therefore the most indicative of the real ebaracter of the vein, was very much superior to anything wbich has yet been met with. The ore is here of excellent quality, and has reached a width of 10 feet, hold. ing this width to the full height at which the work has been driven,-viz., 17 feet. There is also every indication that the lower workings which are in progress will, as they advaune, find the vein equally good at a greater depth. The week before last, fromthecasualhardness of the ore in some labores, the extraction fell oft, making for the lAst fortnight 425 cargas; but this deterioration was transient, and there is now a probability that the extraction will exceed its former average. It should also be borne in mind that, as it has been found necessary to restriot the weekly expenses, the capabilities of the mine, as to the amount of extraotion, are not fully brought out.
",The mine is every day improving, and present appearances justify our hopes and expectations that ere long we shall have a considerable increase in the quwitity of cargas of ore. The surface now presented in ore reeasures nearly 4 varas by 6 (being 10ft. by 17ft.). There iL every indication of its extending into our own territories instead of out of them, as would have been the ca if the ore had made to the south or south-east, instead of the north and north-west, as it nowc does. With rference to the produce and cost, &e., it may be borne in mind that we barely expected to finish the new shaft before the end of the year, but, thanks to the favourable nature of the rock as we descended, and to the unremitting exertions of our administrador, we have not only fiRished it, but since the beeginning of September, when the extraction commenced, we bave obtained ore to the value of $26,86.
"The general tenourof the late reports has shown that an improvement had been going on in this mine for some time, an more especially on the 12th inst. I informed you of the very good aspect of the frente of San Maximo, the chief in size, and the most important, as being the furthest advanced on the new vein. This frente is now looking even better than it then was, and the ore it yields Is of a rich description. Two other frentes, the one at a higher and the other at a lower level on the same vein, but not yet so far advainced as San Maximo, are good and improving. During the Jast week the amount of extraction at the usual weekly expenses has increased to 400 cargas, and the ore is so good that at this rate a handsome profit will result; and if as oe have good grounds to anticipate, this rate of yield is maintained (and we may reasonably hope for a further increase) the mine may be considered as in a very paying and highly satisfactory state. The comparative statement ives a decrease in the amount of carga remitted, but it should le borne in mind that this refers to what has been reoeived at the hacienda, not what has been extracted from the mine, and, from various causes, the amount sent in a particular month may be more or less than the produce.
'There is no doubt,' writes Major Farrell, 'that the mine is of the best promise, is dally improving, and the results at present a8 good as can be expected from a mine still in itsuifancy, and with a greater part of the territory
' I: iared.-I is intended early in the coming year to resume some amount of work in this mine, but merely sufficient to avoid the risk of denouncement.
" Aldana affords nothing new to communicate.
"'Hacienda of Dolores.-All the arrastres (30) at this hacienda are now at work, and grind about 330 cargas weekcly.
" The process of beneficio at the hacienda goes on actively and satisfactorily, but it must be a considerable time before the ultimate result in cash of the ores now produced at the mine can be arrived at and a profit realized.
"Quicksilver.-The current price is$o6cash, $58credit. "The stock in use and in store is 8,3931b. 9oz."

The Corn Trade.
=XH CORN TRADE.
I MARE-LANE, WONDAY Arzmoow. r- 9v
There wore fair suppliee of foreign barley, be ang, ad four last weeo, but of wheat and othergrain they were short. The exports were 1,580 quarters of wheat and 250 sacks of flour.
Of home-grown wheat the receipts were 3,284 quarters, of foreign only 2,001 quarters The raornng's show of samples from Kent and Eaex wags very limited, the condition being somewhat improved. The bettor tone of the last country markets and oontinuance of frost gave holders more confidence, and more money was generally demanded; but as the day wore the sale proved dull, with no improvement in prioe. Foreign found a retall trade at fully as much money.
Of flourthere were 18,670 1sa from thecountry, 76sacks from Antwerp, and 17,694 barrels from the United States. Norfolks during the week recovered their value, and 42g. per sack was demandedo American, being plentiful, were sarcelydxer. The top price of town-mado sampleg re-
a-ined unaltered.
The quantity of Britishx barley was 7,114 quarters, of foreign 11,126 quarters. Scarcely any very fmne malftng wason show; for this the former price was maintained, but the secondary and inferior descriptions were a very dull Sale.

Oats were again shaort, there being only 180 quarters of f3eotch, 1,402 of English, 2,811 of Irish, and 10,153 of boreign; in all but 14,546 quarters. Notwithstanding these limited supplies, there was very little trade at former priceg.

CON .tOUm AND WORTDTaTGNT
Un sAturday the halt-earl meeting of this company w3 held at Cockerinouth M9r John Iteel1, P., presdedl
The secretary, Mr. ifayson, having read the notioe convening the meeting,
The report of the directors commenced by Impugning thte accuracy of the data laid before the directors by the late secret in reference to the affairs of the companJ. FUnder the management of that officiasl the permanent works ana rolliDg stock had been permitted to got very much out of repair, and in consequence the board ha4l been under the necessity of expendiog large smns of money during the lash half-year, in order to place the works on a atisfacto
footing. The report aso stated that a number of ccount4 were included in the half-year's accounts which ought to have been charged in the accounts of previous halfyears This was particularly the case with rd to the stores department a the accounts for the half- ear ended June, 18.56, credit was taken for stores on hand which had been paid for during the las half-year, and by that means the affairs of the company were then made to appear in a better state than they really were, The directors congratulated the shareholders on the great increase which had taken pae in the coal and general merchandise traffic during theltter part of the hal oar, and expressd their confidence that, so soon as they oould reoover from the effects of past mismanamment, the line would pa a very satifactory dividend. The total revenue for the half-year amounted to 6,1387., and the ordinary disbursements to 5,8391., showing a balance of 299l At the commencement of tbe half-year the accounts showed a contingent fund of 1,2484, the whole of which had been absorbed by extraordinary expenses.
The CHA xar then proposed that the report and statement of acounts be reeived and adopted.
Mr. Wzsrox econded the motion.
Mr. DODDS, late secretary of the company, entered into a detail of the expenditure on revenue and capital account during the last five or ax years. Daring the time he ws secretary he (Mr. Dodds) had to exggerate the wants of the line in order to induco the board to grant what was aboolutely necesSar7 to ke7p the works in anything like a satisfactory condition lie objected to the statement of accounts 7or the last half-year, because he believed it to have been prepared for the occasion by those who worked the line for their own interest
Mr. XuSaRAVX: attribtted the presext stato of things to low fares and expensive managementl Re believed the policy of the directors had been to foster the coal trade at Ithe expense of other kinds of traffic orer the line. The
consequence Was, that though the revenue from the conve
ance of coal had increased, yet there had been a decreasein that from most other descrptions of thaffic.
After some recriminatory discussion,
Mr. WOOD, solicitor, proposed, as an amendment, thAt the report be received, but not at present ado pted.
Mr. DbMs seconded the amendment, which was put and negativea by a considerable majority, and the report was adopted.
Mtr llusonividemanded a poll, w hich was granted, and the result was 1,137 votes for and 1,137 votes against the motion,
The numbers being equal, the chairman gave his casting vote in favour of the motion, and declared the report
ardVWOOD proposed, that as the accounts were unsatisfactory, a committee of investigation be appointed to examino the accounts and affairs of the company, and report there unuto an adjornedl meeting on the l4th of Marcht
ext, and that Messrs. J. Harrs, W. Wood, R. Gibson, J. Dodds, and J. Musgraye, be appointed a committee for that purpose, with power to examine all the bookss, vouchers, documents, and affairs of the company.
Mr. W. FLTroCHR moved an amendment to the effeot that the shareholders, having fol confidenco in the directors, were willing to leave the affairs of the company entirely in their hands.
Mr. E. B. STEaL seconded the amendment, whioh, on be;in put to the vote, was deolared carried by a large ma.
On the motion of Mr. WAUGH, seconded by Mr. FLrcuCrR, the ba anoe of 2991. was not divided, but carried to the next acoonnt,
The meeting was then made speil, for the purpose of considering the expedienc7 of leasing the railwayto the Whitehaven Junction Railway Company, and ultimately a reaolution was passed requesting the directors, along with Messrs J and . Hrzris, to meet the directors of the Thite haven Junction Railway in order to discsLs the propriety of effecting a junction between the two lines, and reort thereon to the next half-yearly meeting of the hahreholders, or at an earher period if considered desirable,
The proceedings terminated -with a vote of thanks to the chairman.

London, Tuesday, February 3, 1857.
LOAfDOAV. TUESDAY, FBRUARY 3, 1857.
When Parliament separated last year we all fondly and naturally expected that when it met again it would be able to bestow its undivided interest once more on domestic legislation. Accordingly, many questions were enumerated that had been for some time in abeyance, and on which there had accumulated large arrears of informatior, to be used, and neglects to be repaired. With a good conscience, therefore, or at least with much
content, the public p4riitted its rulers to drop various measures of impoitance, in the ful certainty of seeing them taken up immediately at. the commencement of this session, as a man resumes in the morning his unfinished overnight's work. It could, then, hardly have been imagined that we should only just escape another European conflagrationi, in behalf of a titular sovereignty and a small Swiss town. As little was it supposed that we were already preparing for a war with an Asiatic Power, in order to check in that quarter, or at least anticipate, the advances of Russia. That on the opening of this session we should have to deal with two wars in the East was still more beyond aU human calculation. Yet that is the condition in which we now find ourselves, and our domestic reformers have to lament that the avenues of public interest and the time of theLegislature are oncemore occupied with the press, the bustle, and the glitter of war. On this very day, as we are informed, Lord GREY in the Upper House, and Mr. DIsnAmLI in the Lower, will ask how it is that we suddenly find ourselves at war with Persia on aU her coasts, seizing her ports and islands, and moving two armies, as it appears, upon her eastern frontier. That is the question that engages us the first day, and we cannot but draw the most ominous inferences as to the business of the session. Not a fortnight will now pass without bringing us tidings that will be far more interesting to the political world than dull home affairs. Household topics wiU pale before the fierce light of martial triumph, or under the dull cloud of national disaster ; and all our admiration will be, not for the man who can make the greatest improvement in our people at home, but for him who can destroy most of our foes ten thousand miles off.
Queen VICTORIA will, however, first have to tell her Parliament this day that the firmness of the allies has won from Russia a tardy fulfilment of the Treaty of Paris, and that aU the objects of the late war have now been attained. She may possibly allude to the presence of her representatives at the Coronation of the EMPERon, and report assurances of confidence and amity exchanged between herself and her late antagonist. In another quarter of the world HER MAJESTy's Ministers, with a decision and promptness which do them great credit, have settled a difficulty, not so formidable, perhaps, as that which lately rent the Old World, but more painful and perplexing. We believe we may now say that, thanks to the treaties concluded in the summer with the Government at Vashington and some States of Central America, there is no longer any prospect, or even opening, for a ruptiure in those regions. To the satisfaction of the United States, and without any complaint from Central America, some antiquated and indefinite engagements have been brought to a final and honourable conclusion. HER MAJESTY has to inform her Parliament that immense reductions have been made in our military and naval establishments, though reforms and improvements of various kinds are in progress, and the national defences were never in a better state than they now are. She wiU be able to pronmise at an early day a return to the diminished and still diminishing taxation of our former peaceful period. We could, indeed, wish that here HER MAJEsTY could close this part of her address. But an empire on which the sun never sets is also one in which the sword is never sheathed. The lady who occupies the throne which ALExiANTDER sought in vain, and which has given immortality to a dozen great conquerors, cannot be expected to repose on her laurels. The sea of politics there never calms; every border is a battlefield, and every neighbour a foe. We are at war with Persia; and, for our part, we must regret the absence of sufficient, or at least intelligible causes, though we feel no doubt as to the fickle, treacherous, and insolent behaviour of Persia. It will, however, devolve on HER MAJESTY'S Ministers to prove that they have done all they could, in reason and honour, to avert an appeal to arms. HIER MAJESTY will also have to announce another Chinese war. Here, as at the other extremity of that continent, she will have to report successes which may possibly have their intended effect on the barbaric victims, but which are almost as calamitous to ourselves as to them.
Whatever new measures Government may have the enterprise and the courage to announce, Parliament will find work enough in the measures introduced or promised last session. We are to have some more long-desired law reforms; and the spectacle of several courts of law pulling different ways at the property of one bankrupt bank, the shareholders flying the country in scores to avoid the shower of writs and summonses from all quarters, with the certainty of the whole property being divided among the lawyers, as it is a scandal to the British name, will, we suppose, lead to some simpler and cheaper winding up of bankrupt companies. The Universities, the Corporation of London, Capitular Estates, thje Division and Ecclesiastical Arran"ements of our Parishes, the Law of Partnership and Companies, the Sale of Encumbered Estates, Public Education, Local Dues on Shipping, Church-rates, and some other matters, are either the subjects of pending measures, or have admitted claims to early legislation. There is, however, much more to be done, and in the present state of Parliamentary business there arises a question more important still than any of the above. How long is Parliament to go on professing to undertake everything, but fallingc continually into deeper and still deeper arrears ? There is clearly some fatal want of proper method in the mutual relations of the two Houses, as well as in the internal arrangements of each; otherwise we should not, year after year, have to witness alternations of idleness and pressure, weeks consumed on trifles, and the most important measures postponed at last for the want of a few hours. Did these delays only arise from the universal ambition to do or say something, and as much as possible, it might be difficult to place limits to loquacity or caprice. But the House of Commons is itself to blame in its aggregate character for that excessive jealousy which leaves the many able, willing, and experienced legislators in the other House often little else to
do than to complain at the close of the sion that they have been allowed to do nothing. While the Legislature is reforming everything else, perhaps in this respect it may some day find time to reform itself.

In our police report from Clerkenwell-office for
In our police report from Clerkenwell-office for Saturday last it is stated that "H1 E[NY MA.RTf, " who said that he bad no occupation, and " resided at 1, St. Andrews-terrace, Vaiixhall, " but who was stated by the police to be a tic7et" of-leave man, was charged with attempting to "commit a burglary at the Carpenters' Arns "publichouse, Goswell-street." There was nothing in the circumstances of the case to distinguish it from many hundreds of. others which have been reported during the recess; if we allude to it at all, it is because this day, on the eve of the opening of the session, we would remind our legislators that one of the most important subjects with which they wi1I have to deal, and with which they must deal without any delay, is how our convicts are to be disposed of. During the recess the- subject has been well " ventilated," aecording to the cant phraie. We have freely opened our columns to coz;munication. from all sides upon this momentous question.
We entertain a Very strong opinion that, both
for their own saLes and foirthe a-ake of society, the worst class of convicts must be banished from the British Isles, and banished in perpetuity. Once let us be rid of the worst specimens of the criminal class, and we may then 'hope to try our reformatory experiments -with success upon those persons who may yet regain standing ground among the struggling millions at home. In order to relieve the country from the fearful incubus of a criminal population of the worst kind the sentence of banishment must be in all cases for life. We do not therefore mean that the invariable doom should be that a convict, no matter what his offence may have been, is to be detained in confinement at some Norfolk Island for the remainder of his days. Hle may, when his sentence has been expiated, remain a freed settler in the penal colony, or migrate to one of a less penal character. The only point upon which we insist, as on one which is of the most vital concern to the interests of the empire, is that these islands should not be saturated with a large and increasing criminal population. In ordinary times it would constitute an element in our social system of the most dangerous kind, and should times of political trouble arise it would be impossible to calculate the extent of the peril which might arise from the presence of a numerous body of marauders and law-breakers in our most populous towns.
Such being our own views upon the subject, we have, however, given full opportunities to every one whose word could carry the slighest weight with the public to speak out his mind. Some gentlemen have been. for employing our convicts upon public works at home. The whole circuit of the island, as it is suggested, should be studded with harbours of refuge and breakwater.s-the results of convict labour. Mr. CHARLES PEsxoh, a gentleman who is well entitled to be heard with respect upon such a subject, proposes the formation of industrial prisons-that is, prisons in which the convicts shaU be compelled to work so efficiently that the State shaU be reimbursed the cost of their conviction and keep during the expiation of their sentence. Colonel JEBB looks hopefully at the aseertained results of the ticket-of-leave system-a conclusion in which, as we suppose, few of our readers will be disposed to coincide with the gaUant officer. Mr. MoNcKTON MirLEs' suggestions are pointed at various reformatory processes at home. Mr. Al. D. HiLL would take the ticket-of-leave man when he is discharged from prison, and, by the aid of a society formed for that purpose, put him in the way of earning a honest living, if he be so inclined. Some gentlemen are for transportation to the Hebrides, or the Orkneys-in short, to one or other of the groups of small islands which lie adjacent to our main shores. Others suggest the territory of the Hudson's Bay Company; others Vancouver's Island; others the Gulf of Carpentaria; others Western Australia; others the Falkland Islands, as apt places for deportation. This, however, is but a point of detail, and, although we may ourselves rather incline to the belief that the place last-named presents more numerous advantages and is tainted vwith fewer objections than any of the others, we shal be well content to leave it to the consideration of our legislators. The one thing needful is, that they should arrive at an agreement upon the great question of principle, that the honest men and the rogues cannot inhabit these islands together. After all, the British Executive and the British Legislature have listened to the complaints of New South NVales, of Tasmania, and of the Cape of Good Hope, and so surely the petition of the mother country is not to be treated with indifference or contempt. From the events which have occurred within the last few days at Smithfield we may gather an idea of the dangers to which our social organization is at all times exposed from the acts of violence to which honest, although misg,uided, poverty may be led. The period of any considerable " strike"-and such strikes of late years have been lamentably frequent-may serve as another illustration of the same position. How, if intermixed with these distressed multitudes we should find the regular legionaries of crime, and these legionaries to be reckoned, not by thousands, but by tens of thouisands ? It must not be forgotten that as yet we are but standing at the threshhold of the system. As yet but a very few persons have been liberated and turned loose upon the country, andyet, despite of Colonel Jrnu's figures, we are compeUed to say that we scarcely ever take up a police report, or the report of the proceedings of any court of crimdnal jurisdiction, without finding that in some way or another a "ticket-of-leave man" stands arraigned for some grievous offence, and that generaUy an offence accompanied with violence. These men, as a class, may be grievously maligned-their relapses into crime may be rather the result of circumstances than of their own inclination-but they seem ever to be in contact with the police. If it be so indeed, that they are rather driven back upon crime by the difficulties of their position than allured once more to their old ways by the strange charms of a lawless career, this is only to state in the most forcible manner possible the case in favour of transportation for the sake of the liberated convict himself.
We do, however, most earnestly implore those gentlemen who may see fit to take this matter in hand during the ensuing session not to waste their time and weaken the force of the real argument in idle disputes about the greater or smaUer percentage of ticket-of-leave men who may have been reclaimed. WVe are not speaking of that which is transitory, but of that which is inltended for permanence. It signifies but little whether the liberated convict is or is not furnished with a ticket of leave-it matters not greatly what is done with the small balance of convicts discharged under the old system. What we ask for, and what the security of these islands absolutely requires, is that the worst criminals shall be removed at once and for ever from our shores. So only can we hope to break up the head-quarters of crime and the colleges of burglary and theft. The earlier or later establishment of harbours of refuge, and of other public works of equal utility, is a result which cannot for a moment be weighed in thle balanee
agamst the elimination of the criminal from the general population of the empire. If the liberated convicts are to be retained tve cannot see how a general revision of our police system within the next
five years can be avoided. We may even be compelled to have recourse to the abominable expe-
dient of "papers," and of other siniar checks, which are esteemed necessary on the mainland of Europe. ItL is scarcely, indeed, to be hoped that, without considerable sacrifices of that per.sonal liberty which has hitherto been the most precious birthright of Englishmen, we can retain our convicts at home. They must be watched at all hours. If even now, when they are so few in number, they give us so much uneasiness, how will it be when they have inreased by annual draughts to the proportions of a formidable body, in the State I They must be controlled, that is elear ; and how can this be done, but by the perpetual action of a powerful police-a body in itself not too favourabte to iberty? In conclusion, we would add that the old objections-against transportation dramu from the horrors which are said to have occurred in those leproii lazar-houses at tei tipodes -can
F no longer stand good. They- all est upon the-
baMis of a rare and tedious communication. Vow
thit the same extent of ocean is pased over iu
one-fourth o tie formet time, ana that weehi do the work of months, there-isno reason why a convict estatAiishment should not be conducted with the same regularity and humanity in Australia, or
at the Falkland Islands, as at the Orkneys or the . Hebrides.

After the PRESIDENT'S Message has been de-
After the PREsIDier's Message has been delivered in the United States, despatched across the Atlantic, received in this coumtry, and reviewed with all the interest attaching to the administrative policy of a great and Idndred nation, it may naturally seem incomprehensible to many of our readers that other Messages read to other Senates should still be forthcoming in our A merican intelligence; nor does the circumstance lose any of its singularity when the official manifesto of the American Government appears visited with heavy censure from an American Governor. To understand this anomaly the reader must impress himself more clearly than is perhaps commonly done with the true import of the words "UIJnited States." The idea conveyed in this title is twofold,-first, of a political unity, and next of independent commonwealths. It is perfectly true that there is a Government at Washington, with which, on behalf of the whole American Union, therelations of foreign countries are maintained. At Washington alsor sits the Congress, in the proceedings of which so much interest is taken, and in which the constituent members of the Union are duly represented. This is the central or Federal Government; but 'what should be carefully recollected is, that there are many other Governments or Legislatures in America subsisting at the same time. All the States of the Union, in fact, possess Governments of their own, in whicb, with various modifications aud in various proportions, the features of the Federal Government are reproduced. At different
centres, therefore, we find local Governors, local-, Senates, local Houses of Representatives, with Presidents, Speakers, Treasurers, Secretaries, and all the officers of a regular Administration. Nor is the sphere, indeed, of these State Legislatures at all a circumscribed one. The State of New York, for instance, which in an ordinary map of America looks itself like a province, contains within its boundaries no fewer than 59 counties, each with its own chief town, while the population of New York city alone exceeds half a million. The Government of this " Empire State," as it is sometimes termed, comprises two houses-a Senate, with 32 members, and an Assembly, with 125, the head of the State being a Governor elected for two years. The Legislature of the State meets in due form, like the Legislature of the Union at large, and it was the Message addressed on such an occasion by the Governor to the two Houses about a month ago which appeared in a condensed form in our American intelligence on the 19th ult. So remarkable, however, in many respects is this document that we introduce the public a little more particularly to its contents and its pnrport.
After the ordinary announcements respecting the revenue and funds of the State, Governor lXic communicates some of the results of the census tak-en in 1855. From these returns, which are not yet published, an increase is shown in the State population of more than 360,000 since 1850, although immigration of late had considerably fallen off. One of the facts most prominently indicated is that of the centralization of the inhabitants in towns and large villages, the tendency to which process is so strong that in some of the agricultural counties of the State the numbers have been stationary for many years, notwithstanding the large increase over the whole territory. With respect to education, the details on whichlsubject are elaborately given, it is computed that achool bas been kept on an average through eight months of the year in 11,883 school districts of the State, and some further particulars will be received we are sure with great interest by labourers in the same field among ourselves. The whole number of children in the State (under which term are comprised all between 4 and 21 years of age) is set down at 1,207,214. Of these no fewer than 876,603 are reported to attend in the "common schools;" 45,362 in private unincorporated schools; and 21,967 in academies. The sum of these numbers gives 943,932 as representing the aggregate of children receiving the benefits of education, aud would leave therefore 263,282 unpossessed of this privilege. Governor KING, however, is anxious to explain that inasmuch as few children go to school before 6, and many leave between 16 and 21, the result last given is more apparent than real, and " it " may be safely concluded," he adds, " that there " are very few children in the State who do not " spend a portion of their time in school." The reader will not fail to observe the liberal allowance of time in the work of education denoted by the assumption of 16 as the earliest age at which school is generally quitted. There is another statement, too, in the Message which 'will attract attention in this country at the present moment. Under the head of "Prisons and their Management," the Governor speaks of certain " Houses of "Refuge" in the following terms :-" It is no "longer a doubtful experiment, but a well" ascertained result of the working of these "two establishments, that youthful delinquents "arrested at the outset of evil courses, and sub"jected to the mild yet vigilant discipline and " discriminating control of these institutions, "may be rescued in large proportion from vice and "trained to be useful citizens."
It is, however, in reference to the policy of the Federal Government, as expressed and advocated in the recent Message of President PiEcRC, that the Message of Governor KLNG presents so important an aspect. This policy and that advocacy of it the Governor of the chief State in the Union does not hesitate to visit with direct and uncompromising censure. Spealdng of the conclusions of his own constitutents as evinced at the recent election, he says:-
*" I am the more emphatic upon this point, becaus3 it has been thought by the present incumbent not incompatible with the dignity and decorum of the Presidential chair to stigmatize the conduct, in the recent election, of a large majority of the people of this State, as well asof other free States, by unwarrantably imputing to them motives which they do not entertain, and aims directly contrary to those they both avow and strive to promote. Those imputations we know to be wholly groundless; yet they have been put forth with all the authority which high station and deliberate and artful preparation can confer."
The imputations thus referred to were directed against the views and conduct of the Free States in contending for the exclusion of slavery by the authority of Congress from certain territoriea
(i. e., incipient States) of the Union. At the admission of Missouri as a State in the year 1820 a compromise was arranged between the advocates and opponents of slavery to the effect that no more Slave States should be admitted north of a certain degree of latitude. These terms were not willingly accepted by all the Free States, but they acquiesced in the enactment when passed, and it remained law until a recent period, when, its conditions having become objectionable instead of desirable in the eyes of the South, it was repealed, and the doctrine w-as advancedcthat-each new territoiy,wherever situate, was invested with power overriding that of Congress to regulate such istitutions for itself. What Governor KixN thinks of these pr6ceedings may be seen from his words, which follow : .
" It was the unjustifiable repeal of the CompromIe that 4t $he recent electioa rousecso deep an xoitement, which war aggravated by the fearful scenes of violenoe and wrongs in sas These ovils sprang from the same bitter root-
the effort to extend blavetr-Ad wrre brought ibout lb the faithlou~enunciation on the part of Congress of the abio. u4o ,nd exclusiv nigbt corferred upon itls theconstitu_ tior of ' making all needful rules and regulations respect. ing the territory and other property belonging to the United States! It is not eompetent for any branch of this Government, bor. 11 its branches conm. binod, short of an amendment of the constitution in the prescribed form, to transfer to others a power confided by the constitntion to Congresg; and when tho phan. tom of squatter sovereignty was set up as an excuse for this abandonment of duty, not only was there treachery to the constitution, but a mockery of substantial popular soverelgnty; since, in theory, it professed to leave to the inhabitants of the territory theo right to govern themselve;, while, in fact, the Federal Executive appointed aU the chief officers-Governors, Judges, and M1arsbals. And again, the pretext was to transfer to the first few accidental settlers the right to determine, inaslly it might be, the condition of a territory capable cf sustaining milions, while, in fact, as irrefntably established by the committee of the House of Representatives appointed to investigate the troublesin Kanas, the bond fldc settlers were ousted of the right thus pretended tobeconferreduponthem. Hordes of armed men from Missouri and other States took possession of the polls, drove from them the actual residents who would not co-operate in their avowed purpose of impOSing slavery upon Kansas, and ^hose members of the Legislature infamous to all time by the atrocious laws which they afterwrards enacted. Happily and honourably for free institutions, though most disastrously to themselves, the sons of this State, of other Free States, and we may even hopo some from the Slave States, who went to Kansas for a now home, have steadily and suecessfoly resisted this usurpation. Yet these are the acts whiih, by judicial tyranny, and at the point of the bayonet of troops of the United States, paid out of the common Treasury, the President of the United States has upheld and enforced."
Our readers will not have forgotten the opinions we ourselves expressed upon the tone of President PIERCZ'S Mlessage, nor will it appear surprising to any one that the views which that document ascribed to a large portion of the population of the Union should be indignantly denied. The consideration which the Slave States may fairly claim, the enormous difficulties attending the proposals of the Abolitionists, and even the impulses under which the Southern parts of the Union are urged forward to the extension of slavery, are all points to which ve desire to pay a due regard ; but it cannot be denied that the Free States, with aU their preponderance of resources, and all the inherent goodness of their cause, have nevertheless seen things carried against them till at last, as Governor KiNG expresses it, all the territories of the United States seem open to the blight of slavery. AU we can hope is that the demonstration made at the late election may bear its fruit, and that, as the storm of that struggle itself subsided in an instant when the contest was determined, Bo even the stubborn question of slavery may receive, by the operation either of compromise or time, a solution conducive to that prosperity of the American Union which we earnestly desire.

In consequence of the heavy fall of snow, railroad traffic througbout the country had been almo3t entirely suspended. In New York the Enowstorm was so severe as to completely stagnate business. Such severe weather had not been experienced for 30 years. The mercury had marked six degrees below zero. Several vessels and some lives had been lost on the coast. Advices from Lecompton, Kansas, report that the territorial Legislature was in session, but nothing important had occurred. The Convention was still in session. Preparations were said to be making to carry the " constitutional" elections. None but proslavery men were allowled to sit as delegates in the Convention.
The supply of money in New York was easy, the demand light, and the tendency downward. The rates were 9 to 12 per cent. for prime paper, according to maturity, and 7 per cent. on call. The bank statement for the previous week was favourable. The business in exchange for the Asia has been considerable, and prices a little higher in consequence of the non-arrival of the Southern maiL Bills on London, 8g to 8E; Paris, of. 22;c. to 6f. 2lic., C0 days; Haumburg, 30i to 361. The snowstorm had interrupted business in cotton, but the market closed with more tone and a fair demand for export. Flour, consequent upon smaU stock, trifling receipts, and more favourable news from Europe, had advanced lOc., and higher prices were insisted upon at the close; southern flour extremely dull, but pricei a turn higher; rye flour firm, but quiet; corn meal steady; wheat better, but business light and restricted by the ice. Eye scarce, and held at 2c. to 3c. higher. Barley inactive.
For corn buyers had the advantage. Pork had advanced 25c. to 50c., without any extra demand. Beef continued buoyant. Pri ne mess remained inactive. Beef hams more inquired for, and very firn. Cut meats scarce and higher. Lard firm at 121c. to 13c. Dre.sed hogs higher than for many years. Butter and cheese in good request.
Spirits of turpentine, in face of lower prices at Liverpool and London, firm. Tar more active. Scotch pig-iron held at $30 to arrive, and $31 six months from the yard. Nothing done in bars. Boiler plates 3jc. at seven months. Freights inactive through the inclemency of the weather. Rates unchanged, except for small vessels, which were scarce, and commanded improved rates. Cotton to Liverpool, 7-32d. to id., closing at the higher rate; flour, 2s. 6d.; to London, flolur 3s.
NEW ORLEANS, JAN. 19.
Cotton, uncbanged. FIlour firm at $7 to $7 25c. Pork, firm at $20 to $25 for mess.

MIIRACULUS ESCAPE OF A FRsycB: FISULNO VESSEni-On Friday, the 22d ult., rs the Imperial mail stearpacket Alliance was nearing Calais about 6 p.m., she caume anddenly upon a French fishing boat, wlhich, although a strict lookout had been kept, eas not seen until almost at the moment she was being run over. Collision was inevitahle, and if the Trinity hiouse regulations had been complied with the fishing hoat and her 13 or 14 hands would nsost likely have peryined. Happily, however, the commander of the steampacket, with the most praiseworthy humanity and presence of mind, steered his vessel so as to receive the blow himself, and, instead of runningedown theaboat, the whole force of the colision was expended on the paddlewvheel of the steamer, vhich doubled up and totally disabled te whole machinery of the wheel, breaking through the sprlng-beam, and carrying away the side of te paddlebex. The Dshing boat purseed her avocation, and tbe steamer went into Calain, from which place she nas about a mie distant. Proceedings were subsequently taken against the fishing beat; but the matter wnas settled by cnsent on the part of the latter to pay betwveen 400E. and 500f. damages. -DoViev CptroniHc n

LIVERPOOL, Fax. 2.
The Ciatra stemer brings Lisbon dates of the 26th of J-auuary, when the following vessels of war were in the Tags:-Her Majesty's steamship Princess Royal, Captain {G. Giffard; the Sanspareil, Captain Key, which had re'turned the day before from Bear-Admiral Dandas's squadron for the repair of her rudder (the squadron had met with 'bad weather, and was about 300 miles off Lisbon, where the steam-frigate Retribution had arrived on the 26th); the French ship Austerlitz, and steamer Flambeau, the PhSnix *'aving left on the 23d for the south. The Peninsular packet 'Tagns, With the outward Southampton mails of the 17th, 4iad arrived on the 22d, and left next morning for Cadiz and Gibraltar. The following vessels had put into the Tagus -on the 24th :-The Swedish schooner Venus, from Tarragona drn 24 days, bound for Hull, for repairs; the Prussian brig Calypso, from Newport in 13 days, with coals for Barce aona, for repairs ; on the 25th, the steamer Maeander, from -Trieste and Gibraltar, -with fruit for Liverpool, for coals, 4and was expected to leave on the 26th or 27th. The Bremen bark Herder Severeneg, of 495 tons, 20 days from New York, 'with flour and wheat,was wrecked off the mouth of the Tagus :She anchored outside the bar on the 24th in the evening, in consequence of no pilot going off to her. Next morning, as ashe got under way, the wind suddenly failed, and sho wvas driven by the strong current on to the Cachaos, and was immediately dashed to pieces. The crew had barely 'tims to leave the vessel in the boat before she struck, and littlep-Lu be saved beyond some barrels of flour and staves twashedashore.
The political news will be found in our Lisbon correspond-ence. M. Loureiro, the Minister of War and Finauce, had resigned; but his colleagues took interim charge oi those portfolios, and expected to carry a favourable reply -to the King's speech in both Houses of Parliamnent before -treating of any reconstruction of the Cabinet.
Our Lisbon correspondentb letter of the 26th says
" On Saturday the Chamber of Deputies completed all -preliminary business necessary to declare itself duly constituted for tbe exercise of its legislative functions.
" The King had selectedfrom the quintuple list submitted to him M. Joaqulin Filippe de Soare for President, and M.
lanoel da Silva Passos for Vice-President ; and upon the former beinginstalled in the presidential chair he called upon the deputies to take the usual oath, namely-'1 swearinviolaile fidelity to the Roman Catholic Apostolic religion, to the King, the nation, and the oonstitutional charter, aud that I 'wil aid to the utmost of my ability the promulgation of just and wise laws, calculated to promote the prosperity -of the people, the glory of the King, and the splendour of the State.'
"This oath was taken by all the depiuties exceptthe Legiti,mists-MM. Pereira da Cunha, Dionizio Barozzo, Alenezes, Villas Boas, FrancLsco Hilario, and Francisco ,Maria Caldeira, who declared their scruples would be satisfied by the alteration in the form of oath which had previously been proposed by M. Pereira da Cunha, viz.-' In conformity with the powers which have been granted to me, and in the exer-eise of the functions of deputy, I swear that I will do all
that may be conducive to the general welfare of the nation, within the limits of tho Constitutional Charter and the -act added to it.' It had previously been decided that this proposed alteration in the oath could only be entertained -after the Chamber should be declared duly constituted, and, -as the six Legitimist members declined to take the authorized forn of oath, their names were not called over upon -the first legislative act,-the election of a quintuple .ist for the King to [select substitutes to preside over the sittings during any absence of the President or Vice-President ; nor was M. Pereira da Cunha alloned to speak at all on - protest the Legitimists had prepared against their exclusion from the 'Chamber. Fortunately, the President was not called upon to enforce that exclusion by other than conciliatory and perssiven eans and thus Doni Miguel's partisans, who
ad appeared in considerable numbers in the galleries, were not gratified by the fraceas they had anticipated.
"Immediately after the withdrawal of the Legitimist Deputies the House resolved that the proposed alteration in the form of oath should be submitted to a committee, and it is probable they wil be summoned to the bar of the House, and be invited to take part in the debate whenever the question is discuased. M. Plereira da Cunha, the exponent of -the Ligitimist party during the preliminary session, -has made a favourable icspression upon the House, -and it is thought mutual cencessions nlight have been nade so as to allow him and his five colleagues to take their -seats, were it not that the more violent Aiguelite partisans connected with the BVa-oo newbpaper prevent anything like reconciliation; hence no immediate alteration will be enade in the form of oath, and the six Legitimibts will retain much the same position as Mr. Rothscliild for London. It had always been anticipated that M. Jorge -Jose Loureiro, Minister of Finance, would withdraw from the Cabinet before the meeting of the Cortes, and the publication of his resignation of these offices on the 23d, the
day preceding the meeting of the Legialature, did not, I therefore, create surprise. The Minister of the interior, hL Julio Gomez, has become interim Minister of Finance, and Viscount Sa da Bandeira,Minister of Marine,has in the samie way taken charge of the War Department.
K M. Loureiro, being a Ministry mnan, and one of the King's aides-de-camp, could not be supposed well versed in finance when lie accepted that office to relieve His Majesty from the great embarrassment experienced in forming the present Cabinet; but it cannot be denied that he has perfornied its duties with honour and integrity; he has asathfully fulfilled his own and his predecessor's enMgemenuts, and shown so mnuch more aptitude than could have been anticipated for the officethat one or two imprudences which a more experienced man would have avoided may -well be allowed tops without severe criticism.
" No immediate alteration will be made in the Cabinet in -consequence of M. Loureiro's retirement, the Marquis de Loule, Viscount Sa da Bandeira, M. Julio Gomer, and M. -Cu*ha Passos, being resolved to pass the ordeal of the debates upon the answer to the King's Speech before attempting any receonstruction by the admission of new members into the Ministry.
"M Many reports have been spread in consequenceof 3. Loureiro's resign,ation, and, among others, that the Viscount de Castro is to be M3inister of Foreign Affairs, and M. Antonio Jo-d de Avila of Finance; but this is aU prema-ture. Another version is that the Count de Lavradio, Portuguese Ambassador in London, is coming over to relieve the hMarquis de Loulc from the Presidency of the Counci, and that the IMarquis wvill take the Count's -office at the Court of St. James's; but I believe there is nothing more decided upon this point than the fact that the Count actually contemplates paying an early visit to Lisbon, when it is probable the Cabinet will be definitively constructed, if it gets well through the debates upon the reply to the Throne. The fact that the Deputies have, by a large majority, votedaM. Soare to be President, M. Passos Manoel Vice-President of the Chamber, and MM. Melho -e Carvalho and Ferrer to be their substitutes, shows a great probability that the Ministers will have a decided majority in the debates in question; and they will afterwards have a choice of elements for reconstruction; but I much -doubt of their availing themselves of the party represented ,by Viscount de Castro and M. Antonio Jos6 de Avila."

The Dom Pedro landed 76 pamengers into the Lisbon lazaretto, and had on board a full cargo of sugar, coffee and wood. She was kept five days under quarantine at Stl Vincent's, and her long run from hMadeira was attributed to strong and contrary winds, although the weather was beautiful when ahe left the island.

The Persian Expedition.
I THE PEBSIAk BEXPBDYI&ON.0`
A number of letters from naval and mhilitary officers engaged with the Persian expeditionary force have been placed at our disposal by various correspondents, and from tbem we are enabled to glean a few additional details which may not be uninteresting to the public.
'Cho greater portion of the fleet and transports arrived at the first rendezvous at the little port of Bunda Abbas on the 23d of November last. Here they remained waiting for some horse transports and coal vessels with the 2d European Regiment, all of which, contrary to the general expectation, arrived during the course of the following day. None of the officers were allowed to land here, wvhile, on their side, the natives r.eemed equally unwilling to trust themselves near the ships. But after the first day the timidity of the latter gave way to a keen sense of their own interests, and a brisk trade in fruit, fish, and poultry wvas established with the forces, towards whom also the natives seemed kindly an~d cordially disposed. All who were interrogated had the same tale to tell of the supreme indilibrence w ith which the Shah and his Persian troops regarded the threatened attack. "5,000 men," as the former is reported to have said gloomily, " were not enoug,h to make kabobs (little forcemeat balls) for his valiant army."
On the morning of the 26th the fleet quitted Bunda Abbas in three divisions, and anchored on the 29th five miles below Bushire, when, as our readers are aware, the Persian authorities began expostulating and explaining to the Engrlish Commander-mn-Chief. Thes.e discussions were useless, and- on the 3d of December the geater portion of the squadron removed to the lsland of Karrack, on which the British flag was planted amid a salute of 21 guns from the fleet. The little island, which is only valuable as. affording a aupply of good water, and as a place of rendezvous mn case of any contretemBps at Bushire, is described as bare and desert-looking in the extreme, and the g,raves of very many of the English, who held it from 1839 to 1841, as having " been knocked about and wantonly desecrated." 'The fewv natives who were on the island alid the handful of mercenaries (if men who were never p)aid can be so called) who held the place of course made no resistance; but, on the contrary, were abject in their civilities, and seemed to rejoice at the change of masters. During the 6th the fleet was again formed in sailing order, and, leavinlg 150 men to garrison Karrack, returned to thle spot selected for the landing in Halilla Bay, 10 miles below Bushire. The 6th was passed in preparations for the landing, and at 3 o'clock on the morning of Sunday, the 7th, the disemnbarcation commenced, the movement being covered by the gunboats. But, except as ameasure of precaution, there was little need of their services, for no attempt was made to oppose the forces, and the few Arab horsemen who were visible watching our movements from a date grove further inland scattered in all directions at the first shot. The infantry were all ashore by 9 o'clock, and bivouacked for two days upon the bare ground. The country at this port is described as " a sandy desert, almost devoid of vegetation, and infested during the night by biting cold w,inds." On the morning of the 9th the cavalry having joined, the whole force marched onwards towards Bushire, the infantry in open column, and the cavalry on the flanks. An hour's march brought them in sight of " Bas el Busheer," a mud fort, or rather a large redoubt, which at first was occupied by about 2,000 or 2, 500 of the enemy. This fort, we are told, " was a most di9ficult kind of place, with little gardens, wells, and broken ground around it," till within a few yards of the ditch, which was dry,- though both wide and deep. A steep sloping bank completely protected the side towards the sea from infantry, though it afforded but poor shelter from the heavy guns of the war-steamers, which opened on it with "'timleshell"' at long range. The greater part of the enemy deserted the work at the first shells which burst amOng them, but a body of Arabs, which most accounts agree in stating as about 800 strong, remained, and seemed determined to defend it to the last. Sheltering themselves as closely as they could, they kept up a heavy fire from their long-barrelled matchlocks upon the troops, who were n(wv only a-quarter of a mile distant, and rapidly advancing; the 64th Native Infantry forsning the right, the 20th the centre, and the 2d (E3uropeans) the left. An officer on board one of the wvarsteamers says:
Ast this time we ceuld see as distinctly all that was passing on shore as if we were close to them. The Persians were blazing awa.y quickly from behind their breastworlcs and then rusning back to lead, while our redcoats carne steadily on. The Persians stood manfully to the last, till presently we saw the red line surge over the fort, Persians and all, like a great wave, with the colours of the regiments thei4 in fzont. Then, out at the side towsrds the sea
tePersians came rolling and tumbling down the steep cliff to the beach, tinning to the left to get away. TheERifle Regiment, wvhich was on thme extireme left and ought to have stopped them, did not see them, as they were on the top of the cliff~ and the Persians running along the bottom towvards apassabout a mile further do wn. Some gsined it before the Rifles found out what was going on, and then it wvas too lale for them to catch them, as they got up the pass into the plain in rear of our army, and so cut away. Our cavalry by this time was after them, spreading out like a large fan. You sawY each man singling out a running Persian, and then. there was a flash in the sun. The horseman still gallopped on, but the running Persian wras transformed into a dark spot on the ground."
The letters from officers on shore say that the men advanced towrards the fort with the utmost coolness, and, deploying into line, came on at a run towards the ditch. The enemy gave back at the centre of the ivork, but from its flanks kept up a heavy cross fire, shooting dead, among others, Colonel Stopford, who was in the act of leading his men across the ditch. Very fewr of the English troops returned the lire, but swarmed up the steep banks of the work to close with the bayonet. One writer says the right flank of the work was defended for some timue with desperate obstinacy by abeut 40 A rabs, who had concealed themselves in large holes, and wfho, refusing all offers of quarter, foug,ht to the last. In the attack on these desperadoes Lieutenants IJtter30n and Warren, of the 20th,wvere killed on the spot, and Captain Wood, of the same regiment, shot in five yAaces, and had, besides, his shell jacket " torn and riddled with balls." iEighty-twro dead and a large number of wounded were left behind, inside the work, by the enemy. The troops halted for the rest of the day near the redoubt, the enemy's lig,ht cavalry occasionally hovering near in such a manner as to induce a belief among many that an attack would be attempted under cover of the night. Strong out-lying pickets were therefore posted, and all remained on the gui rie, though nothing eventually took place, and the enemy were nowhere to be seen next morning. The various accounts of the capture of Bushire itself add nothing of importance to the details which have already been laid before the public by our Bombay correspondent. Some of the ninfantry officers mention that when the troops first came up towards the laud defences eight horsemen issued from the city, and in spite of the attempts to take them effected their escape. They also all talk in rather rueful tones of the easy surrender, Singularly enough, most of the naval officers are loud in praise of the Persian gunnery, and their balls, we are told, whistled about the ships and gunboats in all directions. But it seems that in spite of " all directions " most of their missiles failed to take the right one, for the damage done to our fleet was little
more than nominal. At the commencement of the action with the gunboats the drumsand bugles of the enemy were kept incesantly at work in all the batteries, but the rough music of the warsteamers' 68 pounders soon diminished their tones, and they gradually ceased with the discontinuance of the fire. The garrison, or at least about 2,000 of them who marched out after the surrender, piled arms we are tol with the best grace pomible, and seemed neither di&pleased nor humiliated by their defeat. A body of nearly 2,000, however, escaped from the rear of the town, with their weapons and accoutrements.
The very many letters from which we have extracted these few particulars speak of the climate of Bushire as very healthy, though rather cold at present. The whole force is represented as having comfortably settled down for the present into their new quarters in the town. All are animated by the best spirits, proud of the past, and confident of the future.
Respecting the death. of Lieutenant Wiiam Warren, of the 20th Native Infantry, who fell at the attack on the fort of Bushire, we have received the following particulars, forwarded by the chaplain, Mr. A. F. Watson, attached tp the fel4 force ia the Persian Gulf, who, was presentwhen,udied
" The 20th was the first regiment to,storm the old fort of Rusiire, a&,= reachmsbztkq platar, I0ut*asut Warrezu
who was in command ofa detachment, after stainingavey heavy fire, perceiving that the Peraians made signals ef surrender, advanced with his brother offioer, Lientenant Utteritone, to parley with them. When within & yard of the enemy they treacherously fired, and both young officers fell severely wounded. Lieutenant Warren was conveyed on board ship, where he died shortly afterwards, a ball having entered his stomach. He had thrown up a staff appointment which he held to join his regiment when be heard it was ordered to the seat of war, and he fell honour. ably in the service of his country. He leaves two brothers to mourn his loss, one in the 14tb, who went through the whole of the Crimean campaign, the other in the Royal Artillery. Lieutenant Utterstone, who fell at the same time, has also died of his wounds. They were both burled in the Armenian cemetery at the fort of Rushire by the Rev. A. F. Watson."

The Peninsular Mails.
TEE PENINSULAR MAILS.
(A summary of the following, received by electric tele. graph, appeared in our second edition of yesterday:-]
SOUTHAMPTON, FEB. 2.
The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamship AIhambra, Captain J. K. Joy, arrived this morning with ihe mails from the Peninsular ports, in charge of Lieutenant Barrow, R.N., and dates from Gibraltar to January 17; Cadiz, 18; Lisbon, 20; and Vigo, 23. No communi. cation with Oporto.
Both on the outward and homeward passages this vessel encountered the most tempestuous weather. On the 27th ilt., when within 240 miles of Falmouth (Corunna being distant 190 miles and Brest 160), the captain was obliged to bear up for Coranna for coals, tho stock on board being nearly exhausted from the steamer being so long detained in tho bay by heavy headwinds. She arrived at Cormnna on the 28th, and, after taking in 170 tons of coals sailed again on the 29th. This, with the bad weather, will account for the Alhambra arriving so many days after her time. On her outward voyagethe captain, having made one or two ineffectual attempts to enter the harbour at Vigo, was obliged by the violence of thegaletomake forLisbon, withoutcalling at theformer place; and for the seamanlikle skill and judgment displayed by him throughout thi s trying period Captain Joy received highly complimentary letters from the passengers, especially one from Captain Warden, R.N.

"Mr. Oliveira, M.P., returns to England by this packet, after concludiNg, by a visit to Oporto, his tour for the promotion of a general reduction in the duties upon wine. As was natural, a grand dinner was given to him by the British factors of Oporto, and the Commercial Association of that city paid him the compliment of electing him an honorary mneniber, and sent a deputation, headed by its president, the Baron de Massarellos, to congratulate him at the hospitable house of MIr. Sandeman, where he resided, upon his exertions in a cause which when realized would be peculiarly advantageoug to Oporto and the wines of the Douro. It is not, therefore, at al surprising that Mr. Oliveira should have everywhere met with the most cordial reception, and that all should haveevinced a desireto aid himand his 'Wine Duties Reduotion Committee,' but I do not see on this side any signs of a I Custom-honue Reform agitation' calculated to lead to reciprocal reductions in the duties upon English manufactures, which have gradually crept up from the 15 per cent. under Dom Miguel's reign to such enormous rates under the constitutional and 'I hberal' system that many daties amount to 100 per cent., and the general average for the principal articles of British manufactures in iron, wool, cotton, &c., greatly exceeds 50 per cent. While a system lke this is persevered in by a country which bas such great agricultural resources to develope, and might derive great wealth from the increase of its experts to England in exchange for our manufactures, it is not to. be supposed that anything like reciprocity willbe obtained of Portugal for the admission of her wines at a nominal duty in England. Mr. Ohiveira must therefore be prepared, as far as Portugal is concerned, to advocate his cause purely upon English grounds.

Liverpool Chamber Of Commerce.
lI$TE ROOLCHAMBBR-OF COMAAB CZ.
LIVERPOOL, FEB. 2.
The seventh annual reeting of this Chamber was held this afternoon, Mr. Charles Holland, ptesident. occupying the chair. There was £ large attendance of the leadis mner6hants and others connected with tha town, among whom were Mr. IV. Brown, XP., Mr. J. Torr, Mr. T. Bouch. Mi. R. Sheil, Mr. R A. MFie Mr. C. Bashell,
The report enumerated tbe various subjects which had occupied the attention of the council during the year. The
iettion against the bill to amend tho law of partnership Vad been signed by the president and laid before the House. The measure itself had been withdrawn. The coumcil i,t rnply to a request from the Manchester Commeraial Association, had given their opinio,n in favour of a compulsory registration of the names of all persons c(,mposing partnerships. Though aU the suggestions of the council with regard to the Joint-Stock Companies Bill had not been adopted, the more important of them had been embodied in the act; such as powers to local Courts of Bankruptcy, instead of Chancery, to wind up joint-stock compames, and more especially the appointment of official liqidators by the creditors or shareholders in addition to those appointed by the Court. The Joint-Stock Companies Winding-up Acts Amendment Bill had been supported by the counciL The act to Amend the Laws of England and Ireland, affecting trade and commerce, bad met with the approval of the council with two exceptions,-first, the proposed repeal of the Statute of Frauds, which requires contrats, for the sum of 101. and upwards to be in writing; and second, the clause making a guarantee to or for a firm to cease upon a change in the firm. The former exception was met by the withdrawal of the clause, but the latter was not modified in the way which the council considered necessary for the safety of merchants or others receiving guarantees. The council regretted that one valuable clause, " Presentment of. a bil of exchange, if unaccepted, to be an as;ignment to holders of the debt owing from drawee to drawer," had not been inserted, as it would bave given additional security to the bill of exchange. They also regretted the withdrawal of the Judgments, &c., Execution Mill, but they understood that it would be reintroduced next session. The council themselves were about taking steps to obtain the. introduction of a bill to enable persons to bring actions in any part of the united kingdom where the cause of actions arose, azainst persons residing in any other part of the kingdom. Through the Loudon Law Amendment Society a draught of this bil had been prepared, and the council had agreed to act in conjunction with that society in the matter. The draughts on bankers' bills, to explain the law as to crossed checks, had received the support of the council and had become law. A deputation from the Chamber had attended the Mercantile Conference in London, but no report had yet been received on that subject. Tho special committee on the monetary system and Bank Charter Acts had prepared a report, copies of which were on the table. The Montevidean loan question had been settled satisfactorily, and thanks wer due to Lord Clarendon and Her Alajesty's Govermment andto Mr.Thornton, the British representative at Montevideo. The council had not been in a position to move much further on the Sound Dues' question, though they generally agreed with the Parliamentary Select Committee in the resolutions of the lattor, that tbeso dues should be abolished. Under the head of "Postal Commnnications," the report noticed the commencement of the contract for the Australian mail service, the selection of Liverpool as the cargo port for the African mail steamers; and the necessity of a new central post-office in Dale-street. The Treasury had been memorialized in regard to the posoffice site. Alluding next to the export trade, the report stated that the exports from Liverpol during 1% 5had amountedto54,000.0001. invalue, and, consideringhow large a proportion of these exports consisted of cotton manufactures, the council remarked that the threatened diminution in the future supply of cotton wool would be a serious calamity. The extension of improvement of dock sheds had been promoted as far as possible by the council. No amelioration had taken place in the means of transit to and from Manchester to Liverpool. The council were gratified to report that the collector of Customs (Mr. Price Edwards) had been empowered to take the necessary steps to cancel the bonds *ve on the shipment of certain articles during the war. The President had attended the Brussels Conference, -whose proceedings were fully reported at the time in the newspapers. The council regretted that as yet but little progress had been made in regard to telegraphic communication with Holyhead; but they hoped that the Dock Committee would lose no opportunity of promoting so dcsirable a project. With regard to the Honduras InterOceanic aitway, to promote which the President of the Chamber had been requested to act as oue of the provisional board, the council were informed that tho directors were most sanguine as to the realization of a project which would unite the interests of England and the Unired States. The report alluded to the recent visit of Lord Palmerston, and to the opportunity thus afforded the commercial community of Liverpool to express, through the Chamber, their gratification at the satisfactory settlement of questions which had arisen between the Governments of this country and the United States. The library of the Chamber now contained nearly 200 volumes of a statistical and commer. cial character. In concluding their report, the council eulogized the services rendered to the Chamber by the members for the borough and the county. The names of the retiring directors were Messrs. John Aiken, J. Fmrnworth, E Heath, Charles HoUand, H. Hormby, F. Shand, R. Shiel, and Still, who were ineligible for re-election.
The CH1AIRxA.Ne, in moving the adoption of the report and the statement of accounts, said some of the sub'ects mentioned in the report were disposed of in the last halfyear's report. Among those which were new was, first, the Mercantile Conference held during last week in London, where the question of the bankruptcy law administration formed a very prominent topic, with regard to which great unanimity prevailed among all the gentlemen at the conference. All th points of grievance were elicited by able papers, and the reforms agreed upon by the deputation were pointed out and 0laced before Lord Palmerston. Mr. Heath read a very valuable paper in favour of the establishment of local commercial courts, for compulsory jurisdiction in the provinces. The necessity for some great changes being made in regard to the administration of the law in the provinces was generally admitted; and Lord Brougham himself concluded that part of the discussion by the expression of his own strong opinion that the present state of affairs conld not be allowed to exist any longer, and that the demands of the population of the provinces-particularly of the commercial clases-that a more speedy, cheap, andc fficacious administration of justice in oommercial subjects was absolutely necessary and must be settled. Another question referred to in the report was the value of the export trade of Liverpool last year-upwards of 54,000,0OOI-something niore than half of the entire exports of the united kingdom. (Hear, hear.) A considerable proportion of tho Liverpool export trade consisted of cotton manufactures. A diminution of the supply of cotton, as reported at the recent meeting at Mlanchester, would be a serious calamity if means were not taken to provide against it. He was sure that any measures which might be put forward to encourage the cultivation of cotton in our own colonies would receive the support of thu Chamber. (Hear, hear.) In the meantime one of their friends, Mr. Booker, who represented the West India Association in the council of the Chamber, had intended to introduce the
iueation at their meeting, but he had been prevented by Iness from being present to-day - but, terhaps, some other member of the Chamber wold bring te subject forward. (iear, hear.) Having passed a high compliment upon Mr. Price Edwards, the new collector of Customs at Lverpool Mr. Holland concluded by moving the adoption of the report and the statement of accounts.
Mr. W. BROWVNS, M.P., in seconding the proposition, stated, as Chairman of the Atlantic Telegraph Company and the Honduras Interoceanic Railway, that the former was expected to be in operation by June, and that he was to proceed to London on Tuesday with the view of inducing the British Government to fulfil its promise to grant the use of ships to complete the soundings and lay a portion of the cable ; and, with respect to the latter, that the directors had been so far waiting for a change in the money-market before appealing to the British public for the ways and means. The road, he explained, would be well protected by France, Honduras, United States, and Great Britain, who had guaranteed its neutrality.
Mr. C. BUSHELL detailed the proceedings before the Commercial Conference in London, taking the opportunity to pass a warm eulogy upon Lord Brougham, stating that he had been "1 deeply struck with the extraordinary intellect of that great mian unimpaired by time, and as acute as e rer, blended as it was with a courtesy And a patience and attention to the details of business which were most remarkable." With respect to the bankruptcy law the discussions disclosed the enormous evils of that old system, by which 49 per cent. of the assets of an estate were absorbed by the machinery for their collection. One of the propositions before the conference was, that there should be a consolidation of the Insolvency and Bankruptly Courts (hear, hear)-a suggestion in vhich Lord Brougham completely concurred. It was also proposed that there should be a diminution in the number of officers, which would not only effect a saving of expense, but would materially facilitate the working of the estates. When the deputation waited upon Lord Palmerston they received the assurance that subjects brought under his notice should receive the attention of Government as far as possdble. (Cheers.
Mr. T. Boucir, in the absence of Mr. Booker, who had spent a considerable portion of his life in the colony of Demerara, proceeded to lay that gentlemra's
views on the cotton sup ply before the Chamber. With regard to t he olonypolf,Denerara,-He said this startling fact presented itself. It did produce a very large supply of cotton not many years ago, and there were at this time upwardls of 400 abandoned cotton estates-. abandoned not betause they were unproductive, bat simply because there was not labour to cultivate theni. At the time the Emancipation Act was carried Demerara applied for free labour. The feeling in this country against 3aivery was intense, and justly intense, and the imn rtatin of free labour was looked upon by abolitionists with the utmost
je.lousy. It wasack-nowledged that thatljealousy extended sfor fars to be very iXnurious,yneat ne eteas so earnest was thi contrto ipoutthetaiofsavrythattheimport&tioiaon. of labo>urf nykeindwasnotpeirmitted. t Dring thia timethoe wsomintanedheplsiiplof Slave labour wer& tirnethrising a ed th country nowfoud that not only ji

Mr. FORUVARD thought they ahoula not rstrict the operations of the Chamber to one 6olony, but that their
anction should be giren to the principle of free labour as plaied to, all their colonies.
. BOCLth wishd the principle to be as widely reoogmized as its importance demanded.
Mr. BUSHELL considered this question of the cotton sup. ply and free labour tho most important which had ever eigaged the attention of the Chamber, and referred to an article in The 2ines a few days ago wbich be truted would bave the effect of arousing the attention of the coantry to it.
Mlr. R. A. 5'FIE (the etinent sugar refiner) said, tcl
question of free labour in our colonies was likely not on1y to affect sexports and the manufacturing districts, but every townand illage in the country. The supply of sugar was, like that of cotton, inadequate to the demand, and. thpo countr was likely to suffer severely from a scarcity. He truste thatthedissemination of these facts would haye some effect upon the country in causinagit to changeits views regarding the West Indies.
After sonue further discussion, the roposition of Mr.. Bouch was unanimously adopted, and the proceedings termninated with a vote of thanks to the chbirman,

Drury-Lane Theatre.
DRURY-LANE THEATRE.
The multitude that attends this house, to be dazzled by the splendour, enlivened by the mirth, and edified by the moral (for moral it has) of the pantomime, was last night recreated by a new drama, manifestly of foreign origin, entitled thb Black Book.
A certain German Baron has terminated his earthly career, leaving behind him a daughter, named Mina (Miss II. Oliver), who, to all appearance, is not his heiress-st-law, inasmuch as the marriage of her father andmother cannotbe egaily proved. Accordingly a numbor of rapacious relatives, represented by Mir. Tilbury, Mr. A. Younge, Mr. Vincent, and Miss Cleveland, lay claims to the property, and the young lady seems in a fair way of quitting for ever the place of her birth. But a mysterious gentleman (Mr. Charles Mathews) makes his appearance, and promises that she shall remain in undisturbed possossion of the paternat domains if at the end of a month she will grant him whatever request he may be disposed to make. She strikes the bargain, and in the second act, at a masked ball given by one of the collateral vultures, the guardian genius or demon conimences his work. He convinces each of the intruders in turn that he is in possession of sundry secrets disagrecably affecting their reputation, and hints that the resignation of their claims to the, Lilienburg e3tate will be the price of his futuro taciturnity. The dress (very superb) of a fiend gives additional weight to his proposals; the next of kin evidently flmch, and prosperity is the likely reward of persecuted innocence, However, soon after the curtain has risen for the third act the pleasant prospects of AMina ire threatened with a blight. One relative, more pugnacious than the rest, has, it is supposed, killed the guardian genius in single combat, and a compromise on very easy terms is projected by the whole body of cousins. Mina is possessed of the " black book" in which all the deceased demon's secrets are inscribed, and if she will give up this thesaurus of unpalatable information she will be allowed to retain, not the family estate, but the title of baroness. Paltry as this offer is, it will enable Mina to clear the character of her late mother, and she is about to accept the proposition when the beneficent demon, whose death is all a mistake, reappears, and insists on the old conditions-namely, a re3ignation of all claims to the property in re. turn for the destruction of the " black book." The relatives aro alarmed, but do not lose their presence of mind. Perfectly ready to meet the contingencies of the case, they enter Mina's apartment, secure the fatal record, and destroy it. Even the demon himself is now almost at his wits' end, but he bethinks himself that one Hans Caspar (Mr. Lingham), an old retainer, who lurks about the pre. mises, and who never utters a word beyond " Yes" or " No," is in the possession of a further secret which will only be communicated to a person who utters three parti cular words. These three words the demon does not know, and Hans Caspar is a man of such unassaiL able honour that, although he wishes all good to his old master's daughter, he will not give the necessary information till he has heard the signal which his old master has specified. In this strait the demon confesses that the "sblack book' was given him by a gentleman, whose name was Sturm, and who was commonly called "the honest lawyer." " The honest lawyer !" This eulogistio attribute contains the three required words. Caspar's lips are unsealed, his hands are enabled to perform their proper functions, and, knocking a hole in the wall, he produces the certificate of the late Baron's marriage. The relatives now sound a retreat, and the young Baroness bestows her hand upon the energetio demon, who proves to be no emissary from the netber world, but simply a gentle. man of good heart and limited means, who, having been the assistant of the aforesaid Sturm, has in that cnpacity become possessed of all the serets that have made him appear so singularly comprehensive in his knowledge.
During the first two acts of this piece the story is told with somewhat excessive prolixity, but in the third considerable excitement is produced. Virtue seems to be in a cleft stick that renders her ultimate triumph impossible, and when the difficulty is solved a pleasurable feeling of surprise is added to nioral gratification. The opportunity afforded for histrionic display is not remarkable, hut the audience wero evidently amused throughout, and loadly called for fr. C. Mathews at the end of the second and third acts, besides inviting the whole of the company to, make their appearance.

ADELPHI THEATRE.
Although the successes of Transatlantic artists in this metropolis have been by no means few or small, none of themhave been moro decided than that of Mr. and Mrs. Barney Williams, who, bringing with thema the best of testimonials from the United States, made their debut last year at the Adelphi Theatre. Whatever may be thought of the, musical and poetical merits of such compositions as "Bobbing Around," ' Polly, won't you try me-oh?" and
"My own Mary Anne," they are important " facts" with tha London populace of the present day, and he who is not au courant with the words and theairsthus beautifully denominated can scarcely be deemed on a level with his age. Every pantomime echoes these last lyrical sighs wafted back to us from the land of the Pilgrim Fathers. Atr. Woodinx it his entertainmentemnlatesrhenativo vocalist, andthe barrelorgan completes the work of declaring, that in one particuhsr at least, Jahn Bull heartily admires his cousiii Jonathan. ars. Florence was, indeed, the first to reveal to us this newsource of general deli ht,but Mrs. Barney Williarms, the oxiginal comic muse in her own country, has remained in possession of the field, and with her the " Yankee Gal," with all her quaint attributes and melodies, is now completely identificd. Happy, too, is her association with Mr. Barnoy Villiams, who, though he brings to us no secrets across the ocean, has distinguished himself as one of the Imost genial representatives of Irish humour ever seen upon. the Englsh stage.
As the Christmas holydays approached, this favourite couple quitted London to perform in the provinces. Last night they reappeared in two of their favourite pieces, and were heartily welcomed by a numerous audience as a powerful addition to the attractions of the pantomime.

ROBBERIES AT PLYMOUTH.-Within the last fort-
RoBBEBItS AT PLY1tOUTr.-Within the last fortnight Plymouth and its vicinity have been the scene of various burglarious efforts. On the night of the 22d of January the publishing premises of Mr. Latimer, editor of the Plynwutlh Journat, were forcibly entered, the iron chest and casbbox carried into the cellar and broken open, and all the offices ransack-ed, without effect, the money having been removed the previous evening. On the 24th Wr. Bowden, butcher, vas knocked off his horse just oatside the town, and robbed of four sovereigns and a gold watch - 2004 in notes in an inner pocket escaped observation. (On the 26th the residence of Mr. Oram at Stoke was entered through an unoccupied honze adjoining and robbed of some trifling articles of plate. On the 27th smilar robberiea were effected from the premises of Mr. Gloyn, dairyman York-street, Plymouth; Mr. Husband, Stoke; an,d 3Ir Bennett, Milehouse. On Friday plate valned at 6U. was taken from Pounds, the seat of Air. Hodge. Several unsuccessful attempts have also been made. In one case, between 8 and 9 o'clock, Mr. Cooper, Quartermaster, Royal MTarines, encountered a fellor in his garden, and drove him out after' an exchange of severe blows. In another, the burgLara effected a quiet entrance through the rear into the front shop of Mr. Aloysoy, sadd2er, George-street, Plymouth, for the purpose of piercing his wall to get into the valuable store of Mr. Shepheard, jeweUer, but finding the masonry too compact decamped as they entered, unobserved. On Thursday evening a thief entered the attic window of a house In South Devon-place, and on being chased ever the leads dropped from a parapet into a garden and escaped. Daringthe same period cases of stealing from the person have greaty increased, one lady hbaing lost 30. in anknotes. These audacciois acts have created considerable alarm which has been not a little inerea3ed by the knowledge thai early on Wednesday morning two of a batch f 60 convicta brought by rail from the eastward, for transmission to the Dartinoec- prisons, escaped from the station, and have not been re-captued, altough they paed through. the towvn m their prisor dresst,- handcuffed together.

PARI8, SUNDAY, KSa. 1, 6 P.M.
Paria is said to be the place now decided on for the conferences on the Neuchltel question. It is asked both by Switzerland and PrusiL.
The Sybille, French vessel of war, has been ordered to proceed fromBombay to the Persian Gulf to watch any future operations there, or possibly with reference to the claims of the French Government on the Ide of Karrak.
The Moniteur de l'A e publishes a communi. cation from Persia, in which is announced what it terms " a serious fact,"-that the most important provinces of Affghanistan, without whose assistance the British army could not undertake a campaign in the interior of Persia, had declared for the Shah. It is added, that the Governor-General of India, who hadintertained the idea of sending an expedition to Cabul, had wisely abandoned it, having received positive information that he could not rely on the troops of Dost Mahomed. It is said that, Bince thern, the whole of Candaar had declared for Persia. The tribes of the Douranees, who are contiguous to that province, and who are regarded as the most poWerful in the eountry, had prevailed on the Government and the other chiefs to send a deputation to Teheran. Those deputies were admitted to ari audience on the 7th December by Nadir Eddin Shah, to whom they presented the tribute of their homage. The city of Candahar, situate on the left bank ot the river Urghundaub, in a magnificent and fertile plain, and in the richeat portion of Affghanistan, i a strategic point of the greatest importance. It comziands the three roads by which British India may be approached. The district called Candahar, of rwich the city is the capital, comprises three provinces,with a,population of 1,500,000 inhabitants and a standing army of 30,000 men supplied by the various tribes which inhabit it. T4e occupation of the town of Furrsh by the Persian had considerable influence on the Affgham and on the population of the entire of Wetern Afghamstan. The Monileur de rArmie regards the plan of the Generalcommanding the British army m the Persian Gulf, as developed by the attack on Bushire, as well conceived in a strategi poiint of view. It thinka that he never intendde to advance into the interior of Persia, or into the plains of Aflghanistan, but solely to attract the enremy to these points, sld to divert their attention whil he established himself on the Persian Gulf. It affirms as a fact, that since the capture of Busbire the British Commissioner who accompanied the excpedition has proposed terms of peace to the Shah) an.xd among the coiiditions imposed on the Persian Government is the right of the British to in future possess an establishent i.n the Persian Guzlf. Such act establishent is of the first consequmce for the navigation of the Euphrates, and for te new railway which is to connect that river with the Mediterranean. That is the pith of the question. " Such," says the Monitew de 'Arnsfe, " is the plan of the British Government, always so persevering and so correct in their point of view with repect to the interests of the East India Company." The reply of the Shah to the propositions of the British Commissioner cannot be known for at least a month, in consequence of the season andthe distance from Teheran to Bushire.
I mentioned the other day that the Revue de Paris had been supended for a month, in consequence of an artidcle (some chapters of a novel) believed to have an immoral tendency. The suspension is a fact, but the cause is not the one stated. The objectionable article was one on the King of Prussia in the form of a review of a work published at Leip?sic so long ago as 1855, by a Prussian who has resided in England as a refugee since 1849. The book was merely a collection of the various speeches made by the King for Some years past on various public occasions, before and after dinner,inthe exhilaration of convivialityas well as in the less exciting moments when His Prussian Majesty was " fresh and fasting." The juxtaposition of these effusions; the contraet between Ioyal eloquence in the afternoon and in the forenoon; the sentimental, philosophical, and theological strain which pervades some of the speeches, and the curious contradictions found in most of them, produce a very odd effect. The collection is ushered in by a dedication of a moat respectful and humble kind to the King himself, and the Royal portrait is prefixed as a frontispiece. An elegant copy of the book was forwarded by the compiler to Berlin, and the King, who probably only saw his portrait and read the dedication, took it for granted that al was right. He expressed his thanks for the honour, placed the book in his own library, aind ordered a ntumber of copies besides. Sometime afterwards the true object of the publication was perceived, and communicated to the King; who felt much annoyed. It was proposed to prosecute the publisher, and to confiscate the whole of the edition. The article in the 1?eauo de Paris was a critique on the work, and in it the King of Prussia was not spared. The Prussian Minister at this Court complained of the article, and observed, that if the press reflected in such a manner on his master, the official organ of the Prussian Government would probably do the same by the Emperor of the French. Instructions were consequently given to comply with M.de Hatzfeldt's wrishes, and the Roue de Paris was proceeded against. It was let down, however, as gently as possible ; it might, it appears, have been suspended for two months; it is only suspended for one. The King of Prussia must, no doubt, be satisfied with the readiness shown by the French Government to protect him from the wit of French writers.
Itis considered probable thatM. Rouher, Mnister of Public Works, will be named to the Presidency of the Legislative Corps, until such time as M. de Morny can return to France. The storm that a certain recent change has excited in some quarters here will probably be appeased in about twelve months, but hardly before. When M. de Morny returns he wil probably be named President of the Senate, with the title of Archi-somethingChaucellor, I believe. Few so well as the Emperor know how to exalt civic virtue. M. Troplong, who now presidea over that dignified body, is in bad health, and, whether ill or well will find it convenient to retire when St. Petersburg restores M. de Morny to France.
AUSTRIA.
(FROM ORo OWN CORRXSPONDENT.)
VIENNA, JA. 80.
If the accounts transmitted by Italians to their relatives in this city be correct, the aimnesty has produced an extremely favourable impression on the inhabitants of Lombardy. As a consequence of the Traperial act of grace, 87 persons have been liberated, but some few of them were so terribly compromised during the revolution that they are likely to remain under the surveillance of the police for the rest of their lives. In the first official despatch received in this city from Maan it 'was said, "A general amnesty has been granted for the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom," but there is no mention made of the political refy4gees in the aut ph letter which the Emperor addressed to MarshalRadetzky on the 25th. 14y endeavrours to obtain authentic intelligence respectitig the intentions of Government towards the 1ts.iaps who are in exile wrere long! unsuccessfil, butt followinginformation hsas thimorning been acquired :-AII those Ita3ians, being Austrian sub-
jects, who absented themselves fron their homes in order to escape punishment for political offences are at liberty to apply to Marshal Radetzky for permission to return, and, in case of his refusal to accede to their request, to appeal directly to the Emperor through one or other of the Austrian Foreign Legations. To my question, whether the leading men in the revolution of 1848 would ever be permitted to return to their homeg, the reply was, "What the Austrian Government requires is an "act of Eubmission (Aki der Unterwerfung), and thereA no reason to doubtthat His Majesty would pedos even Manin if the latter applied for forgiveness iu a becoming manner." Immediately after the placards posted at the corners of the principal streets had announced to the Milanese the magnanimous resolve of their Sovereign, there was a general movement towards the square in front of the Imperial palace, and the people gave expression to their satisfaction and joy by embracing and kissing each other' wavnn- their hats gad handkethiefs, ana iin .

It is worthy of remark that Austriana who have redded in the Venetian and Lombard provincea have to great faith in the conversion of the Italiins "or the momeut," say they, "the V9netiani and Lombards feel grateful to the kmueror for his clemency, but very soon after his backisturned they wir forget the benefits received Ft his hands and be as discontented and disaffected A ever." Soe mAsv contradictory accounts have appeared in theaSardiauand German papers respecting the offensive behaviour of Count Giullo Litta, that it may be as well to state what really happened. Count Giulio Litta anad the Countes, his wfe, were " inyited" br tho authorities to wait on their Majesties, but both of them pleaded illness. As it subequently transpired that the Count and Countes were walking about in froht of the palace whilethe eaitiere holding their levee, ais Majesty cgmplained to Duke Litta of the conduct of hia brother, and told hun that he should resent any diect shown to the Empress.

While the Emperor was still at Venice many attenxpts were made to persawde him not to go to Mlilan, but he turned a deaf ear to the continual remnonstrances which were made by persons for whom he has the greatestrespect and attachment. "I ame resolved," sud His Mjesty,' " o see with my owih eyes whatistherealstateoflombrdy. It is a duty whch I owe to mra Lombard subjects, and it raust be performed.,' The Emperor has ordered' 300,000 lire to be expended for enlarging and beautifying the Giardini Pubhlicl, and 30,000 hire per azum for repairing the metropolitan church of St..

The Auigsburg Gazette contains a remarkable article on the rench mediation inthe quarrel between Prusia and Switzerland.

Louis Napoleon has become protector of the Swiss Confederation and mediator between the Prwsian Cabinet and the Federal Council.

It is the old story of the lawyer and his clients. Neither Prussia nor Switzerland will gain anything by their quarrel, but France will profit greatly at their expense.
An article that appeared in the last number of the Catolic Sunday Paper, which is edited by a priest and published at Munich, has produced a very great sensation. The murder of the Archbishop of Paris is not exactly justified, but it is excused, and Verger is represented as a kind of martyr. The late Arch. bishop is accused of undue severity towards the lower clergy, and it is said that the same charge may with justieo be made against the Roman Catholic hier-. archy in Germany. The article has made so much noise in Bavaria, that the Jesuits have considered it necessary to announce in the public papers that they are in no connexion with the above-mentioned paper.
The Czas contains some Rusdan news of interest.
General Chruleff, the commander of the Russian1 corps on the frontiers of Persis,has been summoned to St. retersburg, "w here he will receive instructions how to act should it be necesary to advance into Central Asia." In the Russian capital General Chruleff meets the Commander of the East Siberian squadron, the Governor of East Siberia, and Adjutant-General Mouravieff I., the late Commander-inChief of the Caucasian army, "who is more intimately acquainted with the state of things in Central Asia than any other Russian general." According to a private letter received by the C2za from Siberia, a Russo-American commercial company is about to navigate some of the Siberian rivera with steamers. One of the company's steamers already runs in the river Ob, and another is soon to be sent to the Irtisch, which is a tributary of the Ob.
Some time ago you learnt from me that Baron von Mleyendorff had left Nice for St. Petersburg, and we now learn that he has been appointed President of the Emperor's Cabinet and Chief of the Imperial Botanical-garden. The Baron, who is well known to the inhabitants of this city, is aver7 learned and accomplished man, and will hardly fail to exercise a beneficial influence on his Sovereign, who is now too much in the power of Prince Gortschakoff. A new map of the Caspian, and of the countries on its southern and eastern coasts, has just been published at St. Petersburg. A person who has seen the map states that the soundings of the Caspian are marked on the map.
The concession forthe KirnthnerRailroadhas j ust been granted by the Emperor, but the " founders " have not yet been able to place shares of the nominal value of B,000,OOOLf. As no one here believes that the railroad can ever pay more than the 6 per cent. guaranteed by Government the public will have nothing to do with it. The authorities are well aware that the mark-et is over-filled with paper, but still the East Galician Railroad is to be taken in hand at once, "for reasons of State." It is true that Russia is not to be truted, bust still it is the duty, and ought to be the policy, of Government to prevent the tremendous monetary crisis which must come if Baron Bruck does not hold his hand.
The National Loan has risen 1 per cent. within the last two days.

(nMon! OUR SPZOIAX., QOORR 3?ONDI2T.)
T .ven.. , IoAw YORK, JAN. 17. d The great event of thq week is the announcement that California . has, virtually, repudiated her State debt. The intelligence naturally caused a swnsation, especiaily in Wall-street, where sCaifornian bonds wentdown atonce 10 per cent. There wassome culpable iregula,itya few.rmonths ago inthe payment, or rsther the non-payment, of a half-years interest due, which shook the faith of creditors in the sgent; of the Government; but that the "' Golden State" of the Union, the modem El Dorado, the very mine of bullion, slould "4 repudiate," as if we lived again in the age of paper, of which the metaUic basis had disappeared, was a thing not anticipated as possible. There are some events that look like a practical sarcasm on human affairs The sudden insolvency of a land o. gold belongs to this perplexing class of incidents. It is a shock to the financial world; but a little eoplanation diminishes somewhat the grounds of slarm. First, though repudiation is the term applied to the transaction, it is not yet repudiation proper; the people have not directly, or through their representatives, come together and refused to pay, or refused to owe, which is the more summarv form of the process; a decision of the Supreme Court of the State has discovered the alarming fact that nearly the whole of the public debt hua been contracted illegally, *ithoutthe sanction required by the constitution; the bonds are consequently invalid, and the creditors have no legal security for their advances, only a moral one, which it is hoped the equity and good feeling of the people will induce them to convert, as soon as may be, into that valid form always preferred by lenders. The most eon fiding capitalist may be anxious when hla thousands have been spent by a State, and that State is sud denly found to be only " on honoue" as to the payment of interest -and principal, especially if that State is California, where prfessed scoundrelisnm has been permitted to seize political power by the utter indifference of the respectAble part of the community to anying but money-making. The late pugation of society by the Vigilance Committee was the necessary reaction against the rule of rascality, and the Chief hope of the craditora is perhaps in the feeling which produced that violent and convuldve movement. As the fact stand, however, the majority of the people can repudiate, legally, if they choose, and the millions of the lenders are at the will of the ballotbox stuffers, pugilists, gamblers, and blackleg3s who, it is knoWn, have organized and command the majority of the suifrages. All these political pests were not expelled by the Vigilance Committee; they dived under for a time, but it is possible the chance of getting rid of the debt may be turned into political capital, and the ballot-box under their control may "sutain the decision of the highest legal authority." In that case the Californian bondholders may sigh farewell to their cash.
The history of the case Is briefly this. By the 8th article of the constitution of California It is pros vided that no loan can be contracted by the Government beyond the sum of $300,O0, withou L submitting the amount and the purpose to which it is to be applied to the vote of the people at a general election. But the Government in past years, constituted by and partly composed of the class of characters above specified, have borrowed (and spent) $3,000,000, without submitting any portion of the amount for the public sanction required. The omission may have been wilful on the part of the Government, as the provision would have been some check to obtaining money; but the creditors on the spot ought to have known what the charter contained, and their gross negligence in parting with their money without examining what was their only legal security has exposed them to this risk of loss. The debt of California is $3,000,000; of this sun $2,700,000 at least have been borrowed illegally; and unless the people voluntarily assume the liability for it, and, by a formal vote, give the sanction required to all the past money transactions of the Government, the creditors have no valid claim. Having stated their peril, it is fair to give the present estimate of their prospect of escape. The general feeling of the people is said to be in favour of assuming the whoTe debt, and the press is unanimous in advocating the policy of honesty. They deprecate any attempt to take advantage of the legal flaw in the contract. The funds for the payment of the half-year's interest due on the 1st of January have been already provided; but the dividends due in July next will probably not be forthcoming, though the Governor of the State holds out some hopes they may. The question of assuming the debt will be submitted to the people at the next general election, which takes place in September. The present Iegislature can in its next session adopt the debt, make an appropriation "for the future expenses of the Governmentf' of its amount beyond the current revenue, and submit the whole sum to the people for ratification. They will have to vote for or against it as if the debt were a candidate, and very lucky tho creditors will be if their candidate comes out on the popular "ticket." It is remarked here that the feeling hitherto expressed by the journals is that of the city of San Francisco rather than that of the State at large, and that it is too soon to pronounce with confidence what the collective opinion of the miners and farmers of the interior may be. They may have a less vivid sense of the commercial value of credit to a State than the mercantile population of the metropolis. The creditors are few in number, and those who have to gain by throwin,g off the burden are many. The tendency of feeling will be skilfully noted, and if there is any chance o: working it up with partY feeling against the recognition of the debt leaders will not be wanting. The question will be in agitation for many months, during whichCalifornian bonds maybe classed among the " fancy stocks" of the New York market. If the Californiau press is not above the moraie of the public in the question, there are strong hopes that "repudiation" may not be conmummated next September. But till then the creditors must remain in a very disagreeable state of suspense.
The case on which the alsrming legal decision was given by the Supreme Court is very simple. The Governient Commissioners appointed to superintend the construction of a waggon road to the Sierra Nevada endeavoured to make a contract for the survey of the line ; some parties, for reasons not ex plained, applied for an injunction to restra the
commissioners from entering into any contract, on the ground that the appropriation of money made by the bill for constructing the road wag Mlegal and
void, not having been sanctioned by the people, as, all sums raised by loan were required to be by the constitution if the debt of the Government already amounted to more than $300,000.

A4person named Jose y Limantour, of whom the Government of the United ,;tates has long entertained suspicions, has been arrested on a charge of forging grantI f lind within tho city of San ancisco,. under which he has claimed many valuable sections ;ad premises as his property, Many persons, to avoid litigation, have compounded with him for undisturbed posaeesion of their lots, and In this way he has made large sums of money. The, slad of Alcatras, where the fortifications are being bailt, and th& Fasrallonps, where the lighthouse standsi are both claimed by. Limantour; thus the 'United States' Goverhment his a direct interest in disputing his title. The evidence that proves his alleged claims to be forgeries was obtained at Mexico, and bas been confirmed by the confession ot his accomplice in the fraud. The grand jury had found a true bill'against Limantour, and he was in prison in default of bail.
The inquiry into the corrapt influences to which inembers of Congress are exposed at Washington is going on with closed doors. The editor of the New York Times and its correspondent have been examined, but, it is reported, only repeated their
trong "moral conviction" of the truth of the charges, and this is not enough to convict the guilty ones. The committee, it was foreseen, would have great difficulty in obtaining legal evidence, And it is with that difficulty they are now fighting. The nppointment of the comomittee had one result Which was somewhat ludicrous. Several well-known parties suddenly discovered they had urgent private business at a distance from Waahington and the Sergeant-at-Arms, and departed forthwith. They are supposed to be somewrhere out " West," Which is a wide direction. It is possible their business flay detain them from the city till the conmruttee closes the inquiry.
The House of Representatives has pased a bill, already affirmed by the Senate, which will geatly improve the currency by abolishing the foreign silver coins called quarter-dollars, shillings, and sixpence%--otherwise "fips," "bits," "levies," "picayunes "-ninepences, and fourpences. They eirculate for something above their real value, but by the present act they will only pass at a depreciation of 20 per cent,. under their nominal worth, and will begin to disappear. They are mostly old Spanish and Mexican eoins, worn out of all recognition, and, as they do not fit in with the simple decimal currency of the American mint, there is a perpetual losw on small transactions, especialy in omnibus and ferry-boat fares, if change is required. Shopkeepers are encouraged to reckon small prices in these coins in preference to cents, a; they also manage to gain by the confusion, and half the advantage of the decimal system is lost. The New York shilling is the English shilling only in name; in valae it is sixpence; it must be to catch these confusing pieces the omnibuses placard their fares six-and-a-quarter cents, which you cannot pay in cents at all, there being no coin for the quarter; if you give a ten-cent coin for a ride you only teceive three as change, which leaves the fare seven. This small dishonesty, which, when repeated in thousands of cases daily, creates a serious tax, will be impossible when all the coins are exact fractions of each other. There is to be an issue of new cent piece3 smaller and more convenient than the present coppers, but the total abolition of the foreign silver that has so long remained in circulation will be the great improvement. Some of the shillings ara George III. sixpences, a good deal older thaan the Republic; but most of the "6foreigners" are Spanish. A " now-nothing" proscription of them long ago would have been quite justifiable; a large portion of the publiec will now dismiss them with a blessing to the melting-pot.
The party of Mr. Buchanan has just recelved a check in the very State that decided his election. The Legislature of Pennsylvania has elected a Republican, Mr. Cameron, to the United States' Senate, over Mr. Forney, the candidate of the Democratic party, and for whom all Mr. Buchanan's personal aud political influence was exerted. Mr. Forney has been a most active par. tisan for many years, and the right hand of the new President in his poltical operations. Mr. Cameron has sat in the Senate before, and is well known as an able manager of parties-his enemies say, an intriguer. He was a Democrat, but quitted the ranks of that party before the late election, in which he was aprominent supporter of Colonel Fremont. That he should have ousted the chosen political friend of the: President elect is a mortifying event to the Democracy; it is a continuation of the struggle o- the recent contest, and shows that the Republican party is stronger than any one supposed it to be a; the: beginning of the battle. It is also another alarrsi to the South. In a speech on the Tariff Bill yesterday Mr. Keith diverged into the question of slavery, and cited the election of the new senator from Pennsylvania-as a proof of how little had been effected against the rising spirit of the Notth by the return of Mr. Buchanan, declaring thait the " irresistible tendency of events is to sec tional organization." There is no doubt that a chap9ge is taking place, and that political power ii gradually passing to that section of the country which possesses most of the elements of it; bu' that the power, when gained, would be used to the detriment of the political Union seems an assump. tion or an implied threat which Is beginning to lose its terror. The Democratic party really appear to have- acquired, from their long predominance, modes of thought and a habit of language no; very different from those induced by the belief in a divine right to supremacy. All that differs from the striet party creed seems a kind of treason, and the election of an opponent a revolt.
The allegations of the petition of the inhabitants of Carson Valley in the territory of Utah, praying tq be, xelieved from the oppremsion of Mormon government by annexation to the State of California, hiave been puolished in the report of the Committee '-of Territories. It is almost the first official con-

The petitioners state that they are situate 803 miles from-the city of the Salt Lake, that aU their businessis with the State of California, and that the) are not Mormons, and do not wish to be so. They assert that the territorial laws are not administerea with justice, those who are not " zealously aiffected" towards the dominant faith being severely persecuted to their grievous impoverishment.

The State Debt Of California.
THE STATB DEBT OF CALIFORZoA.
(Prom the Ala Californo;.)
By a decison of the Suprem Court, reoentIK made, the citv indebtednesa, in addition to the fact of its antben rejected under the last fmndinr bll passd, lace e cisely ivn the moa e atgory with thatothe State. e charter, under which It w crear h creation of any indebtedne ecee d 0 utas nt

it is well )own and acsnowledged that mauc of it is quite
as m aritorious as that which was funded, and the relon of its rejection was that in the creation of the debti, ohico it represented, cern formalities were not obse
wore in the creation of thath twhih was fundedItwasf pon because the city had not received an equitable consdrto
for the largen portion of the sripyaued that it was rejected, as mnuch of it was really more mesritorious, really more deservint of payment than some of that which was embraced within the provisions of the fundn bill.
We, therefore, are obligedl to nlod upon the rejete city scrip as plcdin precisely the same position as the State indebthedane wcreated under unconstitutional acts andl the principle of repudiation in the one case would apply equaly in the other. . . . We believe at some time that this city debt, or at least that portion of it for which the city has received a quid pto ordo woir be funded or paid. It it Is

l'ho Feople v. J. Neely Johnson et AL"-This wasa bill in equit filed in the court below by the Attorney-General
nst Noel Johnson, Governor of the State of Californis; John A. Brewster, SurVeyor.General - and David Dougls, Secretary of State, a BoArd of Commissioners by virtue of sn act of the Legislture, entitled " An Act to provide for the Survey and Construction of a Waggon Boad to the Sierra Nevada Mountains," to enjoin said commissioners' from entering into a contract for the construction of said road, for the reason,thatsaid actisunoontitutionaland void. The bll shows that said commissoners wereauthorized to contract for the construction of aid road at a price not exceeding the nm of $100,000, and thst~ at the time of the passage of the said act, the State of California was indebted In a sum exceeding $300,000; that sid act contained no provision submitted to be ratified by a vote of the people, as required by the constttution of the State. The facts of the casea agreed on, so that the single point presented is, whether the act of the 8th of April, 18I5, is in contravention of the 8th Article of the constitution or not. The Ian. suage of the article is as follows. (Here the 8th Article is recited.) Ifwewereatlibertytodecsde this case on grounds of pnc polcy, we could not hesitate one moment between ban ptcy an ruin, or credit and prosperity. It is time that the axe should be laid at the root of this political evilthat this system of extravaganoe which has been the curse of the State for the last yearS, exhausting tho substance of the people, destroying our citizens at home, should be stoppedand that honesty, prudence and economy should preside over the legislation of the State and the administration of her financial affairs. With a popu. lation not exceeding 400,000 people, we have incurred a debt, as appears from a report from the State Controller for the year 1855, of $3 040 548 96c. If such things are to be continued, what will be the condition of the countty ten years hence? The entire taxable property real and personal, of the State for the year 1855 was asseasea at $103.873,198 55c. The revenue for the same year was $1,1,573 1c. ; while the expensos AMountod to $L337,496 64c., making an excess of $181,959 64c., being $182,738 68c. more than the expenses of the previos ypar. Whea it is l?Prne in mind that the sum of 212833 56c. was received from the sale of lands in the city of San Francisco, the fact wil be shown that, outside of this source of revenue which in now exhausted, the expense of the Stake during the year 185S, over and above its legitimate revenue, amounted to the sum of $394,793 20c. The Legialture can, at its next session, adopt the present indebtedness of the State, and may go further, and by making appropriation for the faturo necessary expenses of the Govermment, over and above the revenue, submit the sum, in conformity E'with the 3th Article of the Constitution,totho people forrati-
fication. In announcing this oPinion we re awarethat we will meet with theopposition of those whose self-interests are prejudiced, but i it shall have the effect of lopping off unseemly exerescences, and which clutter so thick around the administration of the Government, orof correcting any of the evils which we havo. shadowed forth, we will rest contented, well satsfied that time ana a sober judgment will, sooner or later, justify both the necessity and correctness of this assertion.
The act of April 8, 1856, is unconstitutional and void.- Judgment affirmed, MURRAY, C. J.

I quite agree with you that thejwere deserredly fined for their disrespect to the representatives of the Queen.
At the same time some unneoesary expense is inonrred, and I imagine that you will not approve of all the following items tu a High Sheriffs account:-

"The second principle-that of detall-I would have employed by each house In the metropolis, by the use of an
nstrument analogous to ature's gland, whereby all the refise of the house might be eparated into two parts, the one a oowp artvey pure and oolourlmes water, which would flor off rou our wmers as before-mentioned, and the otherasoLid, deodorizd, and fitted irx every way to sapply the pl of foreign, gano. Every ltouse presents the necessary conditions m thepoesedonot E r-hesand of soot.
The instrument referred to would in principle be constr#cted thus,-It should consist of a cast-iron box, of a tonvenient size Aad pe, placed in the front or back area of each houe. Its noor would communicate with the riwers by means of a suitable perforated plate and trap. It would also be provided with the meas (air- ght) of in. troduclng into it the fir-ahes and the soot, and or clearing out of it, at approprlte seons, the whole contentg. ItB suzmit, or rooF, should terminate in a cut-iron tube about six inches In diameter, which would a3cend the side of the holue perpendicularly, like the present rainwater pipe. Into it the waterclosets of the house would eject, by a cenvenient arranement, their receipta. The whole apparatus, by the ap aiture oa little in uitr, could be made very simple i oonstraction, little liable to get out of e , and perfectlyair-tight as regards tbe possibility of wodlrours or gvzs etc pin&
"Al single tube outside the house could thus easly carry down to the deodorizing receptacle the contributions of the largest number of watercIowse any house might possess. Its sinpidcty and strength lwould enable it to be esily and pe f ctly cleansed when neey.
"Before employment the floor of the receptade would be dovered by a sufficient layer of cinder dust, and, upn the latter, by another layer of soot. In action the f[uid excreta from the waterolosets would in peroolating the soot and ash give up the greater part of their sensible qualities, and would escape into the sewers With very little power to contaminate our river, which objection would be removed by earrying the point or pointsof outlet into the river, some miles below tho metropols, this time, however, without objection from the inhabitants in the neighbourhood of the outlet. This great advantage to our sanitary reforms would result-that we oould have no underground accumulations of putrefying matter. Thesolid excret vwould mingle with the soot and ash become deodorized and condensed, and form a very prercet and manageable manure-manage able because in this form it would admit of such eas and expeditious removal by the scarengers, and without greater nuisance than the present mode of removing our dust. This portion of the business might be practised once a week, a fortnight, or a month, as experience would point out the expediency. For each house it would probably be executed in two minutes, and the carts as they were filled vould be at once driven to the station for immediate transmission to the country.
" M letter would be too long, did I attempt to oombat the objections I foresee, but I believe I am prepared to reply to any, should you deem my communication worthy of discuson.
" In oonclusion, permit me to suggest that, in addition to the advantaes which this plan offers, such as-to health, the avoidance of underground accumulations, which poison our springs and eventually our river; to agriculture, in the supply of a rich guano; to convenience and economy, in the employment of our exitng drains and sewers, and in the addition of a mechanism simple, inexpensive, not lable to derangement, and involving important improvements in the dwellings of the poor ; that the value of the manure

Convicts In Western Australia.
CONVICTS IN WBSTBRN AUSTRALIA.
The following statement, numerously signed by gentlemen connected with the colony of Western Australia, was read and presented by a deputation to Mr. Labouchere on Saturday:-
*To THE RIGHT RoN. EENRY LABOucHrmE, Hyn MA-
.JSTY'S SECRETARY OF STATE FOP. THE COLONTS, &C.
" Sir,-We, the undersigned, having an interest in and knowvledge of the resources of Western Australia, feel it a duty we owe both to that colony (whose real capabilities do not appear to be understood) and this country, to put before the Government a few plain facts to prove that it is peouharly adapted for a penal settlement:-
" 1. Because tho expense of planting a convict establishment (which is always very great) has been already incurred, substantial prisons and dopbts have been built, nd the necessary offices propared to receive a large number of convicts.
"2. The freo settlers (unlike those of other parts of Australia) are willing to continue to receive convicts, to employ them, and to pay them great vages; they merely require some modification of the present system. The convicts can be beneficially employed in the advancement of the colony, such as making roads, bridges, and tramways into the timber forests and to the copper and lead mines.
'4 3. Convict labour has been the means of producing the llecessaries of life, which formerly were very scarce and dear, in abundant supply, and on reasonable terms. The convict establishment has also created a market for food, which is amply.supplied by the settlers and at cheap rates. Slour, as an instance, was formerly from 35. to 401. per ton, now (in O)ctober last) a contract was taken at 201. per ton, delivered at the depot, and the contractor is prepared r.ext year to supply it at 161. per ton.
" 4. Western Australia also possesses a fine climate, and is nnconnected with other parts of Australia (at present) except 'oy sea, and is as much an island as if surrounded by it. Convicts can only-escape by sa, and tho natives would very anon bring them back if they attempted the bush-indeed, the convicts well know it.
" 5. Bolt West Island, about 14 miles from Fremautle. is well adapted for tho refractory convicts, and there is ample room for a large number, and employment for years to come in erecting forts and other necessary public works -raismg salt, eultivating the land, gardens, &c.
" 6. That a large etabllshnent mnay no- be carried on at a very reasonable rate, as the heavy outlay in the colony has been increased principally for buildings, plant, &c.
"we have the honour to remaiwn, &c."

:Los was an application on the part of Mr. Dunn, for the Srologation of a patent granted to hum im March, 1843, zor bleaching palm oil, by which it was rendered colourless and adapted for the manufacture of soap, candles, &o. The process was simple and inexpensive, and consisted in the application of atmospheric air by means of a coil of pipes. It appeared in the course of the evidence produced that the Patentee had disposed of two-eighths of the patent, and that the purchasers would be entitled to any benefit resulting from the extension. One of them, hMr. Johnson, a large soap manufacturer, deposed that in consequence of the application of the patent in his business he hpd realized a considerable profit during several yezrs, whereas Mr. Dann stted that, although engaged in making experiments from 3833 to 1843, and in attending to the patent since the period 'when it was granted, yet he bad only realized about 1,5001.
Mr. Webster appeared for the applicant; the AttorneyGeneral watched the case in behalf of the Crowvn.
Lord Justice KNIGHT BRUCE, in delivering the judgment of their Lordsbips, said they had no doubt of the meritoriousness and utility of the invention. It was highly probable that Mr. Dunn, fronn circumstances into which it was not necessary to enter, had not derived that advantage from it whEich it was desirable and right that he should do. lLooking, howrever, at the profit made by iMr. Johnson under the .patent, their t,ordahips were under the necessity of declinmng to recommend a prolongation of it.

This was the first day of the sittings after Term. The list contained 50 causes, of which 13 were marked for special juries.
TA.LBOT AND AXOYHEB V. COVINGTON, XCUTBM
Mr. E. James and Mr. Gray were counsel for the plain. tiffs, Mfr. Sejeant Shee and Mr. Collier for the defendant.
The plaintiffs, Messrs. Talbot and Co., are barge builders at Rotherhithe, and the action was brought to recover the value of some repairs done to a number of barges, the property of the late Mr. Frederick Covington.
The plaintiff witnesses stated that the work had been done under Mr. Covington's directions, and it was proved that the barges had been registered in the books of the Watermen's Company in his name.
The defence was that, although the barges had been registered in the narme of Mr. Frederick Covington, they were, in point of fact, the roperty of a Mr. Maude, who had been in partnership wit Mr. F. Covington's father, in the firm of Covington and Co. MIr. F. Covington was only a clerk to the firm, but after his father's death the barges were registered in his name for Maude's convenience, as he was a freeman of the Watermon's Company. It was auggested that the plaintiffs were well aware of these facts, and only brought the actioni against Mr. F. Covington's executrix in consequence of Maude havngz become a bankrupt.
The jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs-Damages,
THE QUEEH, AT THE PROSECUTION OF A. F. CAMPBELL,
V. CORLEY.
Mr. Prideaux and Mr. Manisty were counsel for the prosecution; Mr. Serjeant Ballantine and Mr. Metcalfe appeared for the defendant.
The indictment in this case, which had been removed by certiorari from the Central Criminal Court, contained 11 counts. The first charged that the defendant, en the 11th day of December, 1849, did unlawfully, knowingly, and wilfuhly sign and deliver to the superintendent-registrar of Marylebone district a false notice of a marriage intended to be solemnized between him and Constantia Campbell, for the purpose of procuring the said marriage. The second count charged the defendant with having made a false statement touching a particular required to be known and registered. The other counts of the indictment charged a similar offence with respect to two other notices, dated the 30th of January and the 6th of June, 1850. The 11th count charged the defendant with having obtained a copy of the entry in the egister, intending to use it as evidence of the marriage, weit knowing that the said entry was false in a part thereof. The false statement set out in each count was as to the age of Mrs. Campbell, who was described in the notices as bein 6 ar of ae whereas she was alleged to beat least 80. e efendant pleaded " Not guilty."
Mr. PR ux, in stating the case to the jury, said that the 4th section of the 6th and 7th of Wiliam IV., c. 85, the Marriage Act provided that in case of every marriage intended to be solemnized under the provision of that act one of the parties should give notice under his hand to the registrar, in the form set out in the schedule of the act; in the form there was a column headed "age," which was directed to be filUed up with the words "of ful age," or " minor." Section 38 provided, " that if any person should wilfully and knowingly make any false declaration, or sign any alse notice, he should b'e subject to the penalties of perjury." It was not intended, however, to proceed under that clause, s the 41st section provided, " that all prose. cutions under the act should be commenced within three years from the time the offence was alleged to have been committed."
Lord CArBELL.-If the Legidature has fixed a limit to prosecutions for violations of the statute, can you resort to any sunposed common law offence to support the indict-
Mr. PRIDEAuX submitted that it was not a prosecution under the act, unless it was under the clause which imposed a articular punishment for a particular offence ; he must a dmit that he could not support those counts which charged the offence as being contrary to tho statute, but he contended that the fourth count, which did not refer to the statete, bat charged the defendant with signing a false notico with intent to deceive a public officer, was sufficient to support a prosecution for a misdemeanour at common law.
Lord C,AI3BELL said he was quite clear that those counts which were framed directly on the act of Parliament could not be snpported, and as to the fourth count, although it did not see to enforce any particular penalty, yet it must be taken to be founded on the act ; if that act had not been passed, the count could never have been framed, as the offence could not have been committed. In his opinion, the proviso in the 41st section had been most properly inserted by the Legislature, in order to protect Her Majesty's sub. jects from the danger of being exposed to prosecutions for the violation of any of the numerous requirements of the act after the lapse of years, when all the witnesses might be dead, and they would find it difficult to prove their innocence. If the alleged offence had been committed at all, it was an offence against this statute, and, as the prosecution had not been instituted within three years after it was alleged to have been committed, he was bound to tell the jury that the prosecution could not be supported.
The jury then returned a verdict of Not Guilty.

KENTRICK V. BORDER.
The declaration in this case alleged that the defendant had debauched the plaintiffs wife. There were also counts for tne conversion of some furniture of the plaintiff's, and for assault and false imprisonment.
The defendant pleaded " Not Guilty."
Mr. E. James and Mr. Welsby were counsel for the plaintiffl; Mr. AL Chambers and Mr. Petersdorff for the defendant.
It appeared from the statement of plaintiff's counsel that he was a gentleman connected with a good family in Wales. Ile was married in 1844, but getting into difficulties he was obliged t go to Australia with his wife and family. Mrs. Kenrick, however, returned to En&land in 1853. She went to reside in Barrington-road, Brixton. The defendant, who carried on business as a chymist in the Minories, resided within a few doors of her. The plaintiff returned to England in July, 1855. He found that his wife was then residing at defendant's house in the Minories, and he received such informnation as left no doubt of their criminality. It appeared that Ms. Kenrick had taken a quantity of her husband's furniture to the house, and when he went to claim it he was given in charge to a policeman, and hence arose the various causes of action.
Sarah Whittaker stated that she entered Mrs. Kenrick's service at Brixton on the Saturday before Christmnas-day, 1854. The first evening she was at the homse the defendant took tea there. She had been recommended to Mrs. Kennick by her sister, who was in the defendant's service. Mrs. Renrick was in the habit of going to defendant's house, and stopping till 11 or 12 at night. She appeared to be over 40 years of age. The defendant wasa middle-aged man. Mrs. Eenrick frequently sent to inquire how defendant was. He became a bankrupt in 1855, and then went to live at Mrs. Kenrick's altogether. Some of his urnmiture was brought to the house., He occupied an upper room. He was unwell, and Mrs. Kenrick used to have her meals in the room with him. The children took theirs in the kitchen. Mrs. Kenrick desired them to call defendant " "Papa" Mrs. Kenrick was in she habit of remaining in defendant's room for a considerable time every day, and she had lefther there when she wentto bed. She had seen Mrs. Kenrick sitting on defendant's nee and his arma round her waist.
Cross-examined.Mr. Horder was very ill for some time, and not able to leave his room.
MarY'Whittaker, the sister of tho last witness, stated she was in the defendant's pervice in 1854 and 1855. Mrs. Kenrick was in the habit of coming to the- ouse constantly. On one occasion she desireder to fetch a dressing-gown, as she intended to remain allcniht.
CrosstexanedfMr. co.Horder was a greae invalid al this time.

Border said he had been naaing a noise at the house, but le (the plaintiff) told the inspector his wife and furniture were there, and he had paid for the lodgings. He was then discharged.
Cross-examined.-He had been at defend.nt's several times. On the last occasion Horder said it was U o'clock, and he wanted to shut up the house.
John Strickland, the policeman, stated that when he was sent for the defendant told him to take the plaintiff into custody. He replied he could not, as the man had a right to be where his wife and family where. Defendant then Paid he would charge him with disturbing him in his business, and they all three went to the policeoffice.
Cross-examined.-There was some disturbance when he got to the house, and the defendant might have said that Mr. Kenrick had struck his wife.
Mr. E. JAMES summed up the evidence for the plaintiff.
Mr. PEvEssDonri addressed the jury for the defendant. He contended there was no evidence whatever in suprt of the charge of criminal conversation; no evidence 'ad been given of the marriage, or of the teruis on which the plaintiff and his wife had lived, so as to show what injury he had received, even if they believed the charge.
Mr. E. JAMES contended that the plea of not guilty did not traverse the fact of the marriage.
Lord CA-'BELL said he would hold that it did. He then proceeded to sum up the case to the jury. He observed in the hbsence of any evidence as to the position of the parties it was for the jury to say whether, on the evidence, they beheved that the adultery had been committed; that vas the frst cuestion he should nbut to them.
The jury, after some deliberation, foundthat the adultery bad taken place, and assessed daniages at 204
Lord CAmPBm &d said he would direct a verdict for the defendant, as the marriage had not been proved; but he would reserve leave to the plaintiff to move to enter it for him for the sum found by the jury. He would daeo direct a verdict for the defendant on the count in trover. It would be for the jury to say what damages the plaintiff was entitled to on the third count for the assault and false
risorment.
The jury found for the plaintiff on that issue-Damages,

BASTABLE V. IRELAND.
This was an action brought by the plaintiff to recover damages from the defendant for negligence in permitting a diseased horse to be agisted on his marshes, to which the plaintiff had sent several horses to agist, in consequence of which some of the plaintiff's horses caught the disease, and two died.
1r. Montagu Chambers, Q.C., and Mr. Needham appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Prentice for the defendant.
It appeared that the plaintiff iq a liverystable-keeper and cab-proprietor, carrying on his business in Staryard, in the Borough, and that the defendant is a farmer and grazier, at Plaistow, in Essex, and occupying about 400 acres of 2marsh lands, wiich he lets out for the agistment of horses. The plaintiff had been in the habit of turning out his horses on the defendant's marshes for the purpose of recruiting them. In July, 1855, the plaintiffhad a number of his horses at the defendant's msrsbes, when the defendant permitted a horse belongin to a WIr. Moore, which had got the "faroy,"tobe turned out on his marshes. This disease precedes theglanders, and is a contagious disease. The result, according to the plaintiff, was that five of the plaintiff's horses caught the disease, and two of them died of it, the others being ill and seriously deteriorated by it for a long time. He estimated his dam ges at 136L The defendant's case was that Mr. Moore's horse showed no symptoms of faroy when sent to the defendant's, and that there was no negligence on the defendant's part. He called witnesses to prove that in the year 1854 the defendant had horses with farcy or glanders at his stables, and lost a colt by the former disease. A veterinary surgeon proved that the diseases of farc and glanders will hang ab4nt a stable for a long time; that farcy was not likely to be caught by horses agisted with a horse in that disease. The disease was usually got from eating in a manger which had been used by a diseased horse; turning a horse out with the seeds of farcy in him would promote the disease. One of the plaintiff's horses was ill when sent down to the defendants, and died;- and it was contended the plainstiff's horses caught the disea~se in his own stables.
The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff-Damages801. This case occupied the Court nearly all day, e ju bringing in their verdict at near 6 o'cloci-.

RONVBOTTOM V. WILSON.
Mr. Serjeant Hayes and Mr. S ink appeared for the plaintiff in error, and Mr. M. Smith and Mr. Field for the defendant.
This came before the Court as a special case.
Tho declaration was for an injury to land and ancient houses by mining operations. The question raised was whether the plaintiff had any cause of action. The plaintiff was owner in fee, under an award, of lands and buildings, which buildings had been erected for more than 20 years. The defendant, or rather those from whom he took, were the allottees, under the same award, made nearly * century since, of certain coal mines under the land of the plaintiff. T'he mines were worked by the defendant ; the damage of which the plaintiff complained arose from the sinking of the surface soil, by reason of the working of the mines underneath.
The construction to be placed on the EnclosureAct, under which the award was made, on the award itself, and on a covenant contained in the award, was brought in question, and upon that construction the argument chiefly depended. In the covenant referred to was this clause-that the parties should not be subject or liable to any action for damages, for or by reason that the surface might become uneven by snkng, occasioned by the working of the mines.
After a long argument,
The COURT took time for consideration.
TOZES; V. C1nmLDS A2D ANOTHER.
This was a demurrer to a rejoinder. In the declaration it was alleged that the defendants wilfully refused to re. ceive the vote of the plaintiff at the election of vestrymnen for the parish of St. Clement Danes.
The defendants pleaded that as the plaintiff had not paid a church-rate, he was not entitled to vote.
The plaintiff replied that the rate was ilegal.
The defendants rejoined that the rate was legal, and had not been quashed.
JAn actioni had been brought by the plaintiff, who was a parishioner of St. Clement Danes, against the two churchwardens for refusing to receive his vote at the election for vestrymen. The refusal was on the ground that the plaini iff bad not paid a church-rate, which church-rate the plaintiff alleged was illegal.
The Court of Queen's Bench had taken time for consideration, and then gave judgment for the plaintiff.
lThe action was then tried, and, under the direction of Lord Campbell, who stated that the jury must say whether or not there was malice-if no malice, the aotion could not be maintained-the jury negatived malice, and the verdict went for the defendants.
There was a bil of exceptious to this ruling.
Mr. Serjeant SHER was heard for the plaintiff, and Mr. Knowles and Mr. Keane appeared for the defendants, but were not called upon.
The CODET considered that the absence of malice prevented the action being maintained. The judgment of the Court for the defendants was therefore affirmed.

'This was a trader-debtor summons, talken out by David Leopold Lewis against Sir Charles Fox and Mr. John Henderson, trading as Fox, Henderson, and Co., for an alleged debt to Lewis of 5001.
It Was stated that Sir Charles Fox only had been served with the summons. He 'was not present, and Lewis did not now wish to avail himself of the statute.
The summons was dismissed accordingly.
His HNonUS said these summonses were too often miade asmatter of arrangement, and were taken out for quite different purposes than those contemplated by the statute. The object of the statute was to compel a failing trader to become bankrupt and divide his assets equally among his creditors, and not to give one creditor a preference.

In this case the insolvent a*peared upon two distincpetitions, under the following circumstances..-He was heard in 1856, and received an adjudication, whereby he was ordered to be discharged after the lapse of 13 calendar months from the date of his vesting. That period expired only last month, but long previously the insolvent- had got out of prison by an arrangement with his detaining creditor. Be, however, soon atter contracted some fresh debts, and -was again arrested, whereupon he filed another pttition for his discharge. Upon coming before the Court tha learned commissioner refused to proceed with the second petition during the period of remand covered by the original adjudication, and therefore adjourned the case, at the same time ordering some debts inserted in the second schedule, but which ought to have been entered in the first, to be struck out from the former docwment.

The first edition of the calendar contains the names of 120 prisoners.
One of the gentlemen who was rummoned to serve on the grand jury chlimed to be excused on the ground that her was over 60 years of age.
The REcoRDE said, that this was not a legal excuse for exemption from service on the grand jury. The gentleman might, if he chose, have applied to the parish officers to take his name offthe st;butt as his name appeared theretheCourt had no power to excuse him unless upon some legal ground In a very important case now pending in the Court of Error the question was raised whether the excuse of a juror for insuffcient cause did not invalidate the conviction. He was, therefore, unwilling to excuse the gentleman from serving upon the ground of his being above 60, because this was not a legal excuse from serving on the grand jury, although it would be an excuse from serving on the petty
The gentleman then took his seat in the box with the other jurors.
The RECOBDEB, in his charge to the grand jury, said, he regretted to see that there were a great number of cases to be brought before them, and that although less than X month had elapsed since the adjournment of the Court there were no less than 120 prisoners for triaL The caess with one or two exceptions, however, were not of a charactear that called for any lengthened remarks from him, and he did not think that with perhaps one or two excentions, there were any that were likely to present any diffi cuties to the grand jury; and it was satisfactory to fnd that there was only one case which involved the destruction of human life. In that case it appeared that a young man, who was engaged as a chymist's assistant, was asked for a small quantity of castor oil, and being at the time engaged in making u a. prescription, a portion of which comprised prnssic acid, ae
ut aportion of that into the bottle instead of castoroil, and the result wa the death of the person by cwhom it was taken. If that fact were made out to their satisfaction the prisoner would in law be guilty of such an amount of neglect in deallng with such a deadly poison as would render him amenable to a charge of manslaughter.. It was right it should be known by all persons who had to deal with such dangerous articles, that they were bound to use the necemsary care and caution to prevent accidents, and that they were liable to punishment if. they did not take that care. There was charge a of uttering. a forged 101. note on which it appeared to him they would would do well to direct their attention to the evidence' of the guilty knowledge on the part of the person accused, because that was the very gist of the offence. Any one niight innocently be in possession of a forged note, and if the evidence did not make out in a satisfactory manner that the person who uttered it was aware at the time that it waS forged, they ought, for the' sake of the prisoner, not to find the bill; and, indeed, it was more satisfactory for the prosecution that this course should be taken, because, if the prisoner were tried upon insufficient evidence and acquitted, there vwould be an end of the matter; whereas, if they ignored the bill and further evidence were afterwards obtained, the prisoner would then be still liable to be tried upon the charge originally made against him. The only remaining charge to which he considered it necessary to refer was the case of a person who wouild be indicted for having attempted to persuade a witness who was bound over to prosecute upon a charge of felony to aseep out of the way at the trial. In this case it appeared that the prisoner had endeavoured to persuade a witness who had been bound over to give evidence, not to appear and give his evidence against the prisoner. It was important that it should be made known that this was an offence against the law, and that any person who endeavoured to persuade another not to fulfil the duty cast upon him by the law was liable to punishment. J)ustice bad not unfrequently bcen defeated by such proceedings, and he therefore wished it should be known that if any one were convicted of such a proceeding, he would certainly he punished with some degree of seve-
Abraham Messenden and Thomas Tomkins surrendered to take their trial for stealing a heifer, value Ill., the property of Wilim Gibson.
Mr. Robinson prosecuted; Mr. Sleigh defended Tomldn, and Mr. Ribton appeared for the otber prisoner,
This case occupied the Court for several hours, but the facts lay in a narrow compass. The prisoner Messenden, it Epearep, was an extensive cattle salesman, residing at UT.ateiaton, near Bletchley; and the prosecutor was a farmer at Kingsbury, near Harrow; and it appeared that on the 8th of November he had a heifer grazing in one of his fields, and she was missed on the following morning. The prisoner Tomkins was employed by Messenden as a drover, nd it appeared that on the 13th of November, which was Kingston fair day, he was employed to drive a number of cattle from the Harrow station to the fair, and these cattle were placed to pasture in a field belongin to a person named Beecham, near Kingston, and when this drove was removed to Kingston the heifer in question was found with the other beasts, and it was eventually sold at Kingston fair, the animal having been driven there by the other prisoner, Tonikins, both prisoners having been concerued in the sale.
The defence set up ox behalf of Tomkins was that he had merely acted under the orders of his master; and
Mr. RarTON, on behalf of the other prisoner urged that there was nothing to show that he had been at all concerned in stealing the animal, and that it had got among his own beasts by accident.
A drover lad, who was engaged to drive a portion of the cattle that belonged to Messenden, wvas called as *a witnets on his behalf, and he stated that on the morning of the 9;h of November he found one more beast in the drove than he had placed in the field to pasture on the previous
A great number of highly respectable vitnesses gave the prisoner Messenden au excellent character, extending over a great number of years.
The REcosnPOs summed up the evidence with great minuteness.
The jUry retired about 6 o'clock. They were in deliberation nearly two hours, when they returned into court and put some questions to the learmed judge as to certain points of the evidence, and then again retired to their room. At 10 o'clock they were again brought into court, and they then stated that they had agreed so far as Tomk-ins was concerned, and their verdict was that he was Guil, upon the second count, of receiving the heifer, knowing her to have been stolen.
The RECORDER then inquired of the jury whether there was any reasonable probability of their agreeing upon a verdict as to tho other prisoner t
The foreman said, they were not at present all of one opinion, but he thought that in about an hour they might agree.
The REcoRDEB said, that although it was late he would wllingly wait another hour if they were likely to come to a decison within that period.
The jury then again withdrew, and at five minutes past 11 they again came into court, and upon the Recorder inquiring if they had agreed upon their verdict as to the prisoner Messenden they stated that they had not, and there was no likelihood of their doing so.
The RECOniDET said, that under these circumstances be had no alternative but to adjourn the Court to thefollowing morning.
The foreman of the jury said, that he really felt very ill, and he wished to know whether he was to be kept without food or nourishment of any kind for so many hours?
The REcosDER said, he was very sorry that the jury should be so inconvenienced, but the law gave him no alterriative. If there was any chance of their agreeing he would wait any reasonable time.
A juryman said, he did not think there was any chance of their coming to a decision. Ten of the jury were of one opinion, but a]l the arguments used by them only appeared to convince the other two that they were in the right.
The REcoRDnE said, he had no right by law to do more than to ask if they had agreed upon their verdict, and as they were not likely to agree the case must be adjourned.
The jury were then locked up for the night.
NEW COURT.
(Before the Comnox SEtlEAxT.)
Henry Myatt, clerk, was indicted for embezzling samu of money belonging to John James Noyes, his maaster, amountinginthe whole to about 601.
Mr. Giffard prosecuted.
The prosecutor is a teadealer in Fingbury, and prisoner had been his traveller for five years, at a salary of ll. 4s. weeldy, and 31. a-month. The connexion which the prisoner had the management of was among coffeehouse keepers, and the sums in question had been paid to him upon account of his master. The prisoner had also in several instances robbed the prosecutors of parcels of grocery by bringing home fictitious orders.
The jury found the prisoner Guilty, and he was sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment.
George Hll, a boy 13 years of age, pleaded " Guilty" to having unlawfully wonnded Moses Wolf.
It appeared that the prisoner had insulted the prosecutor, a man grown, who boxed his ears for so doing, whereupon prisoner stabbed him in two places, the latter wound in,lieted bing Prevented froma entering the abdomen by the intervention of theshort rb.c

GUL.DHALg}.Da,jd Thomas Saddler, a count-ry traseller, in the employ of Messrs. Crowden and Garrod, caryig on business *s brushmakers and gerneral merchants,
at Nzo. 6,Facon-street, city, was charged wvith embezzling
3001. and 400i.d
The prisoner was reman ded.
Bow-sTXw.johnD Spurgeon and Arthur Woodmoss, two shabbily dressed, middle-aged men, who described themelves as attorneys' clerks out of employ, were charged before lM. HAn. with beig concerned in obtaining 30s. from Mr. Laidman, attorney:p account agent, Chancery-lane, by means of a forged promissory note.
Spurgeon said he had acted in the belief that tlhe statements of Woodmoss were true and the promissory note was genuine. The other prisoner made no defence.
They were conmuitted for triaL
Mr. Saperintendent Durkin attended to inform his worship that a meeting of the unemployed bad been held that day in Smithfield, from which about 70 men had proceeded to t. Giles's parochial-office to apply for relief. Some of thes had been offered relief in the house, others had been told that their cases would be in qired into, and some had been offered work. He believe that some were not satis. fied, and would shortly apply to this court.
Mr. HALL directed that the relieving officer be requested to attend at the same time.
A fevw minutes afterwards about 30 men, dressed for the most part as bricklayers and labourers, presented themselves at the court. Mr. ankldin, the reheving officer, was already in atttendance.
The first to address the magistrate was a dull, stupidlooking.mam, who spoke in a confused and incoherent manner, and seemed scarcely to understand why he attended, except that a speaker at the meeting had desired him to go first to the ofCfe, and then to that court, and to reportrogres5toRhanl3ithe smate *e the meeting) the following dav.
.- man has been told that he wil

Mr. HALL did not see what more the relieving offtcer could do. He had not the absolute control of the parish funds4 and so he must make inquiries before he took upon himself to expend them.
The applicant left the court satisfied.
The next appEcant admitted that he had been offered admissionto the house, and had refused. He wanted toknow whether be was obEged to break up his little home ?
Mr. HALI,.-It is of no use to argue with me, because I am boundhby the law as well as you. I have only power to make them take you into tbo hous If you don?t choese to go in, I can do nothing.
Mr. Rankn said, the majority of these men had never p plied before. Had they done so that morning, most of tnem, in all probability, would have received outdoor relief but they came in a body, after being at the meeting, when no time was left for inquiry. If they did not like to enter the house, let them call again next day, and most lkdy they would be relieved.
Several others came forward and stated their cases, which were precisely similar to the above. Those who had been offered admission to the workhouse and had refused, were somewh.at clamorons, and had to be expelled. The others were satisfied with the statement that their cases wouldbe inquired into.
After about half-a-dozen had 'addressed his worship, the remainder not desiring to do so,
Mr. HAT observed that he saw no ground for supposing there had been ny unilin - to relieve these men, and
The court was tnen ca
MAO oOUGasntEr.-Frederick Augustus Cope, William Gogney, Thomas Edwards, and James Newlaud, four fashionably dressed young men, were brought before Mr. BItNGH'4 charged with bein drunk and disorderly
PolEce-conatable 18c s'tated that about half-past 3 on Sunday morning he was on duty in Regent-street, when his attention was attracted tothe four defendants, who were singing and shouting at the utmost pitch of their voices. As their-disorderly conduct was likely to disturb the inhabitants he went up and begged of them to desist. They refused to do so, and sid they were gentlemen arid would do just as they liked. He again begged of them to go away, but all to no purpose, and the defendant Gosney perssted in shouting, saying he was born makug a noise, and a noise in the world he must make as long ashelived. Witnessthen attempted to take them into custody, when the defendant, Cope, with his fat struck him a violent blow in the face The other defendants also made great restaunce, bht eventually, wth the asistance of other constables, they were lodged in the stationhousd. Winess added that the whole of the defendants were drank
The defendants gave a general denil to the charge, and complained that the police knocked them about most blutally, in proof of w,hich they exhibited bruises, and a collar covered with blood was shown to the Court by Gesney.
The constables said, the streets were very slippery, and the prisoners were too drunk to walk without getting a fil now and then, which accounted for their bruises
Mr. BLNHA X thought the charge fully proved, and fined them 20s, each.
MARYLxBoNz.-AM extraordinary degree of exditement was caused in Northumberland-street, in front of the en,trance to the Marylebone workhouse, in oonsequence of the assemblage of between 500 and 600 men who had congrepted at the tes of the establishment demanding relief, and their conduct was of so violent and menacing a description as to compel Mr. Tubbs, the relieving officer, to cause it to be made kmown to tnem through some of the officers under him that if they did not depart peaceably the polce would instantly be sent for to remove them. Upon this intimateon the men, after consulting for a fewn minutes with two or three of the leaders of the party, wended their way, followed
immense crowclof persons,to the entrance of this court wmchwasthereby so completely blockedtup as toprevent the possibility of those who were waiting to be admitted upon other cases in connexion with night charges, &c., from enter therein. Mr. Fel, the chief clerkc, communicated this ct to r. BRoUGnToN, who desired Mr. Franklin, the chief usher, to admit a few of the men only, which he did. The principal spokesman in the affair was a young man named Crabbe. Among those admitted ws one who carned abanner7 hoisted high over his head, and upon which w;as wittenm legible characters, "Peace and order is our motto; there are 150,000 men out of work in London and thhe districts,hose wvives and families are starving. Shame,
The Magslte remarked that the banner bore upon the face of it a falsehood; no such number as that indicated nor anything like it could be out of employ in London and its immediate vicinity. That a great deal of distrm, however, existed there was no doubt.
Crabbe and two of the others said that they went to the workhouse with many others on Thursday last, with an understanding on the previous day that a rota of the board was to be in attendance, in order that their complaints might be made known by them, but that they went and did not see the members of the board.
Mr. Tubbs said that he had made known to the Board of Guardians all that had taken place at this court on Wednesday last, when numerous complaints were made, the man Crabbe being at the head of the party; aid that the rota present, after hearing the whole of the facts, pased a resolution to the effect that they had fuU confidence in him (Mr. Tubbs), and that they left the matter in his hands, being satisfied that he, in the exercise of his discretion, would act properly in the responsible situation which he held. Mr. Tnbbs added that on Thursday last he relieved no fewer than 2,053, and on the next Saturday 2200. Many of the applicants who were strong, single men had been offered work, but they refused to perform it, and it would really be a robbery on tho ratepayers to give assistance to such persons, mnore especially when they came mixed up with sucha large body of others to makea claim uon the parish. Such a state of things prevented him
Tubbs) from transacting properly his business at the ouse. With regard to seeing and relieving parties well known to be in distress, and who came to receive money at the house regularly, the interruption to his business smce the present movement was great in the extreme. If the men, who had come in a bodyto the court, withtheirbanaer held up, as it had been stated, parading through the streets, would attend at the workhouse on the next morning (this day) their cases would be individually gone into.
ttr. BRouGTox remarked that he was extremely sorry tae so much distress existed among the working classes at thepresent inclement Eeason, and advised the men to go to the workhouse at the time appointed by Mfr. Tubbs, and conduct themselves there in a civil and peaceable manner.
Mr. Tubbs said that in the event of their acting up to his Worship's advice relief would be afforded, more especialy to those who had wives and families.
The large assembly then quietly dispersed from the precincts of the court,. and Mr. BROUGHTON proceeded v.ith the ordinary business of the day.
Yasterday Mr. BROUGH-bON received from "J. F. S." 51. for the poor-box of the court.
CvLERbENWELL-The half of a 5l.-note, No. 39,030, has beeu received from "IL E.; and 20 from * Anual,' for the poorbox.
THA3S;u.-John Rann, an ablebodied man, aged 49 (as stated in the police-sheet, but who did not look sO old), -was brought before r. YARDI,XV, charged with begging. The prisoner wFas described as a labourer, of No. 6, Love-
John Bivand, *police-constable, No. 117K<, stated that
he saw the p'nso-ner and 12 or 13 others, each carrying a newsboySvel soliciting alms in Stepney. The prisoner went into a butoier's shop inBedford-street, whilehis companions surrounded the house, and the master of the shop gave him a penny. He then took the prisoner into custody.
Mr. YARDLEY said this was the commencement of the week, and the prisoner had been very properly taken into custody. If the prisoner and his companions went about in large bodies soliciting alms, or singly, they were liable to be committed to prison as rogues and vagabonds The conduct of the prisoner was very much aggravated by his going about with others in a body. That looked very much like intimidation, and a person who would refuse to give alms when solicited by one man would most lkely, wvhen 12 or 13 surrounded him, submitto force. He would tell the prisoner, and through him tell his fellowmen, that proceedings like those could not be tolerated; and that if hefoundthat large bodies of men went about soliciting alms, armed with shovels, or any other implement of trade, he would punish them severely, and commit them for a ong term tot,e House of Correction and to hard labour on the treadmilL The magistrate, observing the prisoner about to speak, said he knew what he was going to say. He
ew tere was * good deal of distress, consequent principally on the want of employment, in eXiStenCe. Some of
tat distress was inevitable, and a good deal of it was caused by te improvidence of thelabouring classes, wrho would not lay by for a rainy day. He had only to say that any repeti-
ion of this would be Severely Du-ihed. lhe then ordered the rest of the p:isouer's comupanions to be called,
I'hree of them advanced from the bhack of the cout
They were all ablebodied men, and on Mr. YARDLEY pointing out the illegality of, their proceedings, and stating hat the, were entitled, to parochinl relief, they said ehey hs t app *ed for relief to the relieving officers of parishes to which they belonged, and it was refusedL One of them, a young countryman, however admitted that he had been offered admittance into a worihouse, which he had refusd, because he only wanted relief for a short time.
Mr. YARDLky-You would rather go into a workhouse than into a prisom?
The young man.-No, I would not. I woulai prefer a prison to a workhouse at any time.
Mr. YARDLEY said the man was talking nonsense. It was no disgracefor a man who was in distresstoseek and receive paochial relief, and it was his right; but to commita breachof the law was disgraceful. People would readily employ men who from temporary distress or other causes were obliged to seek parish relief; but people wrould not employ gaol-birds.
Twe young mam-If you go into the Mosaic law-
Mr. YARDLY.-Nonsense, mn. I am not going to enter into a discussion with you upon the Mosaic law ; but I tell you this, that I will not allow people to be intimidated; and the ne-xt man brought before me who goes about with others in pags shall be oommitted to the House of Correction, and be kept to hardlabour foralong trm. Themagistrate then directed Mr. Livingston, the chief u-sher of the court, to give the unmarried men of the gatg a quartern loaf eacn, and the marriea men two loaves each, and directed tbem to apply again to the relieving offioers of the parishes to which they belonged, and if they were not properly relieved according to wa they could wait on him again and be would intercede for them.
Soon after a depntation of unemployed labourers entered the court and asked for relief They sid they were "society men," but did not exphlan to what society they belonged. They were out of emylor and destitute.
Denny, an officer of the court, said there were upwrds of 100 men eeking relef in the avenues of the court. The psssge 3was crowded with them.
Livingston, the chief usher, said he believed there were not less than 150 men seeking relief.
Mr. YARDLnrY was very sorry.to find there was so much destitution, and hoped the working classes would be patient, for he believed better times were coming, and that Business would revive, Ho also hoped that boards of guardians and relieving officers would- do their duty with promptitude and liberality in times of exigency, and prevent these frequent appeals to magistrates, whose courts ought not to be converted into offices for the relief of the poor. The magistrates had no oifficers to mske inquiries into the truth of the numerous etees of destitution presented before thenmHe felt much for the distressed individuals who were constantly relating their destitute condition, but it was impowsible for him to investigate a'tithe of the cases daily brought under his notice. Mr. Yardley then desired Livin-ston to provide himself with 5,, worth of silver and relieve the unemuployed labourers with 6d. or 1I each, and to close the outer doors of the court, for if it became known in the neighbourhood that he was relieving unemployed men thera would be 2,000 or 3,000 persons in and about the cotrt very soon.
In the oourse of the day Mr. YARDLLY gave variou4 sums to famhing individuals for their temporary relief and said he deeply regretted the large amount of destitution which existga among the deserving poor of the large populous district assgned to that court.
In sentencing two coalwhippers, one to 14 days' imprisonmnent and the other to pay a fine of lOs., for assaultinj polcemen in the execution of their duty, Mr. YARDLEY sad he had not forgotten that two years ago, In the depth of winter, when great distress prevailed among the coal'whippers, he had relieved great numbers of them from the poor-box fund, and a very few weeks afterwards many of the same men were brought before him charged with being drmuk and disorderly, and paid tho fines imposed upon them. The prisoners before him were in full enployment, but if a frost continued for any length of time they would be seeking relief from the poor-box or the parish rates. A vast amount of misery and destitution would be prevented if men were a little nrovident in the summuer months' whei they were full7inp toyed.
LAErEL-Mr. Vincent Jones, a person of gentlemnanly-ap , v whose address on the ch sheet was Idaida-hi Pddington, was charged before Mr. ELLIOTT with being drunk and creating a disturbance in the street between 12 and 1 o'clock on the Sunday morning.
Sergeant Rouse, 13 I; sd that about a quarter to I o'cloc -on Sunday morning he heard a loud screaming noise near to West-suare, and, on going to the spot from whence it proceeded, he found two ldes and a young gentleman who was with them id .a state of great alarm. They complained that the prisoner, who was then clone by, was folowving them with a knife In his hand, and they were very much terrified at his manner and appearssce. Observing
large clasp-kife open In the hand of the prisoner, Ve aslked him what he meant by carrying such a weapon inm wh a way in the public street, and his reply was that he should give it up to him, and he did so. He then told him that carrying an open knife in the street at such an hour in the morning, and alarming respectable persons, was a serious offence, and he must accomp him to the station-house to explain his conduct to the spector on duty. This the prisoner refused, and insantly demanded the restoration of his knife, saying, that an attempt had been made to Rarotte him, and mnade such a noise and uproar as to disturb the inhabitants of the entire neighhourhood. He also abused him, Sergeant Rouse, and one or two constables who were attracted to the spot by the noise, in the most shameful manner, sayig he was a man cf fortune, and they merely his servants; and at the station-house, when ask-ed what he intended to do with the nife, his reply was, "To cut sour- threat if you came in my way."
Mr. ELLIorT.-Was the prisoner drunk?
Witne8s-He was, Sir. It was evident that he had been drinking a good deal, and he had besides a pint bottle of rum in spocket, which fel out, was roken, and the greater portion was spilt.
Prisoner.-I wish to ask you whether I did not tell you in the first instance that two men were following me out of the square, and that that was the reason of my taking out mynife to protect myself from them ?
Yitness.-No, you did not say so at first, but you afterwards in your excitement said something about garottrs, and to beware of them; you also said something about garotters at the station-house.
Two othercon,stables confirmed in every particular the statemeol thelast vwitness, and also spoke of the prisoner's violence.
]Ur. Edward Thomas said he was attracted to the spot on Sunday morning, and observing that the prisoner was exceedingly violent, and refused to go with the constable to he staion, and knowing also tbat he must sufferfrombeing taken there by force, he with much persuasion prevailed on him to take his arm, and went with him to the stationhouse. The witness added that the constables-and particularly Sergeant Rouse-behaved with the utmost forbeaance and temper in the case.
The prisoner, in reply to the charge, said that he had been out and drinking wine, dan in passing oat of the square he waspressed on by two men,who, he had no doubt, were garotters, and this it was that caused him to talke out his kife to defend himself in case they offered him violence.
Mr. ELIoTr remarked that it was quite clear that the two men spoken of by the prisoner had no existence, except in his own bewildered imagination, and convicted him in Xa penalty of 30s., or 14 days, and also ordered him to enter into his own recognizance to be of good behaviour for six months
At half-past 4 o'clock last evening a number of persons-it ws sad about 1L0 in number-marched in a body from Lambeth Workhouse to the entrance of this court and requested to be shown before the sitting magistrate. As on a former occasion, they were desired by request of the magistrate to send a deputation, instead of appearing in a body. They did so, and in a few moments three of the party made their appearance. One of them got into the witness-box, and banded to the magistrate a paper similar in substance to that presented on a former day, after doing which he proceeded to say that he accompanied a party of about 150 persons to Lambeth Workhouse to ask for relief, and it having besn refused them they came to appeal to his Worship to know what they should do.
Mr. ELLIOTT said that on a former application of a similar sort he had sent an officer to the workhouse to request that relief might be given them agreeably to the regulation of the rdians- but on that occasion they refised to accept the relief offered them, and went away. He should now send an officer with them to make the same request, and that was all he could do.
Inspector Armsworth, of the L division, said he was at Lambeth Workhouse just before, when the person in the witness-box, who gave the name of Newton, made an application for relief for himself and others, and was offered an order for the admission of himself and famrily into the workhouse, but thisu e refuseod
Mr. ELLIOIT (to thes*pplicant).-Why did you refuse this ?
Newton.-Because I don't want to go into the house.
Mr. Armsworth further said that the parish officers offered to attend to the case of all the applicants, provided they were at the workhouse before 12 on the foUo;wing (this)
d r. ELLXOTr, on hearing this, said it was the business of the parish, and he could no further interfere in the matter, and the parties then retired and marched off,
Mr. James Rogers, the will-known comedian at the Olympic Theatre, waited on Mr. ELLoiTT, *nd handed to his Worship the sum of 13s. 4d.. with the following note:-
ir-;Allow me tODresent to the poor-box the enclosed 13. 4d.. being the amount I received for perforning at Windsor Castle on
SI am, Sir, your obedient servant.
lliott, Esq. ' JAIES ROGERS"
Mr. Rtogers requested his Worship would, with his usual kindness, acknowledge his small donation in the usual way upon which Mr. ELLIorr said he would give a receipt for it; bat Mr. Rogers replied that that was not necessary.

The Marriages, Births, And Deaths.
THE MARRIAGES, BIRTHS, AND DEATHS.
(From the Registrar GenDeral's Quarterly Return.)
This return comprises the births and deaths registered by 2,196 registrars in all the districts of England during the autumn quarter that ended on the 31st of December, 18.6 - and the marriages in 12,208 churches or chapels, about 3,811 registered places of worship unconnected with the established church, and 628 superintendent registrars' offices, in the quarter that ended on the 30th of September, 1856.
The returns of births and deaths for the four quarters of the last year imply that in the country, as well as in the metropolis, the health of the population of England and Wales was better than it was in any of the 10 previous years. The effects of sanitary measures are becoming apparent, although they are only partially carried out within limited areas. Out of 3,O000 persons living, the fall of the annual deaths from the average of 23 in the 10 years 1846 to 1855, and from less than 23 in the year 1855 to less than 21 in 1856, is decisive. The births in 1856 exceed the averageproportion. The Christmas quarter of the year Ehows a decrease of deaths and an increase of births. The marriages exhibit a considerable increase in the summer ouarter of 1856 on the returns of the summer of 1855.
rAnRRIAGES.
78,304 persons married in the quarter that ended on september 30, 1856; and this number exceeds by 4,002 tha number of persons who married in the summer quarter of 1855. The marriagesrose from 37,151 to 39,152. An in. crease in the marriages is observable in every division There is an increase in Kent, and a larger increase of mar: riages in Hampshire, which is partly due to the return of
eamen from the war; for the marriages in the Portsea .sland district, including Portsmouth, were 156, 211, and 335, in the corresponding summer quarters of 1854-56. In Devonshire the increase of marriages is also considerable; in Plymouth and the adjoining districts of Bast Stonehouse and Stoke Damerel the marriages in the same three quarters were 315, 330, and 514. In Norfolk the chief increase was in Norwich. In Lancashire and Yorkshire the marriages increased but little. In Sussex, Wilts, Dorset, Glocester, Salop, Rutland, Derby, Cheshire, and Northumberland, the number of marriages was less in the summer quarter of 1856 than in the same quarter of 1855.
The rate of marriage was 814 to 100,000 living in the summer quarter of 1856; the average rate of the 10 quarters preceding was 805.
BIRTHs.
The births of 157,615 children were registered in the last quarter of the year 1856; and this implies that the rate of birth was 3'267 per cent. per annum, against the corresponding average rate for the quarter of 3.14.5, deduced from the births of the 10 autumn quarters 1846-55. The births exceed by 8,762 the births in the last quarter of the preceding year; and the increase pervaded the whole of the 11 divisions. The increase of births is in some districts ascribed to the return of men from the war. Westmorland is the only county in which there is a decrease of births.
The births on the registers of the year 185G amount to 657,704 ; a number exceeding by 22,581 the number of births in 1855. It is the greatest number of births ever registered in any year in England. The birth rate of the year was 3.454, while the average of the 10 preceding years was 3 339.
INCREASE OF rOPULA-TION.
As 157,615 births and 96,521 deaths were registered in the last quarter of 1856 the ascertained natural increase of the population in three months was 61,094.
In the same period 30,063 emigrants sailed from the ports of the united kingdom, of whom it was ascertained that 16,962 were of English origin ; and allowing for a proportion of 4,721 persons of unascertained origin, the English emigrants may be set down at 19,211, the Scotch at 2,406, the Irish at 15,467, foreigners at 3,240. It is novel to see that the English emigrants exceed the Irish in number, and that for 5,897 sailing to the United States a force of 13,198 cmbarked for the Australian colonies.
As 657,704 births, and 391,369 deaths were registered in the year 1856, the natural increase of population in England was 266,335. The number of immigrants into England during the year is unknown; the emigrants of English origin amounted to upwards of 70,285.
The natural increase of population in the united kingdom was probably at the rate of 1,000 a-day.
THE WEATHER ANDt TEE PRICE OF PRONISIONS.
The inflnence of these elements on the births, deaths, and marriages may be studied in the tables, and in Mr. Glasher's description of the meteorological phenomena.
The pressure and the temperature of the atmosphere were remarkably variable. October and December were warm, November cold. 3 9 inches of rain feU at Greenwich, and this was 31 inches less than the average quantity.
The price of the quarter of wheat was 63s. 4d. on an average of 13 weeks; so the price of wheat has faUen 16s., or 20 per cent., since the autumn of 185, when the price was 79s. 4d. The quantity of wheat and of wheat flour entered for home consumption was equivalent in the three autnmns of 1854-5-6 to 19,513, 42,358, and 103,328 quarters of wheat weekly. The price of meat by the carcase in the London markets decreased during the three autumns of 1854-5-6; beef was 58d., 5 6-8d., and 5 2-8d. per lb.; mutton, 6d., 5 6-8d., and 5 6-8d.; so that there has been a sensible reduction in the price of beef, but this has borne chiefly on the lower qualities of meat. The highest prices remained at 61d. a lb. in the three autumns. Potatoes (York Regents) were 100s. a ton at the water-side market, Southwark, or rather more than a halfpenny a lb.; or 22 lb. for Is. The price of this important esculent was the same in 1854, but it was 5 per cent. less in the autumn of 1855.
STATE OF THE PUBLIC HrEALTH.
The deaths of 96,521 persons were registered in the last quarter of the year 1856, and the rate of mortality in the three months was 20 per 1,000 per annum. In the districts ,comprising the chief towns in which nearly half the poplulation is living the people died at the rate of 24, wlhile in the remaining districts, comprising small towns and country parishes, the death-rate was 17 in the 1,000. This shows in a strong light how much room there is for improvement in our large towns; for it is well kaown that many fatal agents which mnay be arrested are at work in the small towns and country parishes.
It is gratifying to find that the public mind is now awakened to the importance of rendering the whole population healthy, and that the salutary results of supplying the people with pure water, of removing the dirt from under the dwellings, and of bringing all the known appliances of hygiology into operation, througis the agency of a scientifis body of medical health officers, are becoming visible.
391,369 pesons died in England and Wales during the year 1856. About 324,000 died by diseases and accidents which are at present almost inevitable; and 67,C00 persons perished by causes which, if they are skilfully attacked, may, it is believed, be either mitigated or removed. Let us pause to consider for a moment what these five figures mean. Each unit represents a life lost. Many had lived to the ordinarylimitsof age, but thousands in thethrongwere children, sons, daughters, sisters, brothers, wives, hus. bands, fathers, mothers, who had not lived out half their dlays. These lives have been lost; bat happily 47,000 men, women, and children of the same classes are now living who would have been dead had the same rate of mortality prevailed in the year 1856 as prevailed in the 10 years 1846-55; and the loss of lives is 34,873 less than it was in the previous year. A certain number of these lives have been saved by sanitary measures.
The names of the British soldiers who die abroad are never inscribed on the national registers; so that the deaths in the war are not here brought into account, otherwise the diminution of the deaths in the aggregate population, including the army, wotld exceed the above numbers to the extent that the mortality was augmented in the years of the war and diminished in IS56.
The rate of mortality in the South-Eastern Counties was generally below the average; but dysentery and scarlatina prevailed, and raised the mortality at Woking, Guildford ;* typhus and gastric fever were fatal at Gillinghamn, one of the Medvway sub-districts. Scarlatina and low fever were fatal at Thatcham, Newbury, where the deaths exceeded by 32 the deaths in that district in the previous year. Ia many districts the mortaltty was low.
The South Midland Counties were generally healthy, but the mortality rose in the districts of Bishop StortfordI Eton, Wycombe, Buckingham, and North Wirehford; ague and fever were busy in some of the fen dweUings; Hatfield and Cranfield were attacked by fevers. There is no inspec tor of nuisanees in the parish of Hatfield.
The Eastern CGunties experienced a reduced rate of mor. tality, but scarlatina wasthe scourge of some districts. The registrarof Radwinter, Saffron Walden, says:-Malignant
scarlatina continues its fatal course in my district, althouigh steps have been takoa to improve the sanitary state of the cottages.'
The registrar of Clare, Risbridge, " attributes the excess of deaths over births to the prevalence of typhus and scarlatina in the parish of Poelingford,-which is caused to a greatextent by the crowding and want of ventilation in cottages."
A t St. iargsaret's, Ipswich, the registrar reports:-" There were six deaths from typhus, snd these in the higbest and apparently healthiest part of the district. I found that the privy of one house, adjoining those in which the deaths took place, had not been emptied for a long time, and that vegetable matter and filth bad been stffered to accumulate until the whole had becorme a living mass of putrefaction."
How long are these experiments on the effects of dirt to
- in fms abd in similar oases the sub-district and the diptriot are designated by the two names.
be continued? When ill the town authorities of Suff6lc make arrangements for preventing such deplorable accidents by removing their guano to the fields every day ?
In the South-Western division-Wilts, Dorset, Devon, Cornwall, and Somerset-the mortality was below the average; but scarlatina prevailed in some districts. It was fatal in Tiverton. Vaccination is neglected, and small-pox has been fatal in several cases. Fourteen cases of small-pox proved fatal in Salisbury. In Looe, Liskeard, seven poor children died of this disease :-" In none of the cases had children been previously vaccinated. Many persons delay. if not entirely neglect, to have their children vaccinated," Thirty-two deaths from searlatina occurred, mostly in the low marshy part of St. Andrew, Plymouth. Effective measures should be adopted, for the sake of the navy, to render Portsmonth, Plymouth, Sheerness, and the great naval stations healthy, The mortality in them is still excessively high, and the whole of their sanitary arrangements are defective.
In the West Midland counties the mortality fell in Glocester, Hereford, and Salop; rose in Stafford and Warwick. Stone, Wolverhamnpton, Walsall, West Bromwich, Kidderminster, Worcester, Birmingham, Aston, Foleshill, and Coventry lost a greater number of their inhabitants in the last quarter of 1856 than they lost in the corresponding quarter of 1853. Scarlatina and measles have prevailed in several districts. Coventry has lost 66 young children by these diseases; of 156 deaths 109 occurred among young children under five years of age' The children of this city are evidently much mismanaged. In West Bromwich, north-east, the births and deaths are below the average, in consequence " of iron-works and blast furnaces being void." The drainage, sewerage, and other sanitary improvements, lately carried out under the Improvement Act, have been followed by a decrease of deaths in the city of Hereford.
In the north-midland counties the mortality was stationary. The depression of trade and the failare of several large manufactories in Derby has driven many families away from the district, and reduced the births; the deaths are also gone down from 277 to 215 in the quarter.
In the North- Western counties, Cheshire and Lancashire, the health of the people exhibits considerable improvement; the deaths are less in number by nearly 1,000 than the deaths of the corresponding quarter of 1855. In Liverpool there is an evident amendsent, which will, it may be hoped, be rapidly progressive. The registrar of Bnry South ascribes the entire absence of small-pox "to the attention paid to vaccination," and the freedom from other zymotic diseases " to the great improvement which has taken place in the last 10 years in the sewering, paving, and cleansing the streets, a nd to the regulations under tDe Improvement Bill for common lodging-houses." The high mortality of Manchester, Chorlton, and Salford is declining. The registrar of Hulme, Chorlton, explains some of the causes of this improvement in so important a part of the population:-
"Grat interest has been taken by the corporation of Manchester in effecting sanitary improvements. The Sanitary Association has exerted itself in promulgating and teaching to the poorer classes the laws relating to health, and the advantages of ventilation and cleanliness. To these may be added the privilege which this large community enjoys in having a bountiful supply of most excelent water, which is eonveyed, almost without limit, into every court and alley in the city, I am also of opinion that the Priendlv Societies Act, passed in 1855, by requirig a certificate from a qualified medical practitioner of the causes of death, has had a tendency to diminish the mortality of children, inducing parents to place their offspring, when ill, under skilfulmedical aid, instead of taking them to druggistsand empirics; to abolish the practice of administering natcotic and poisonous drugs; and by protesting and pres6rving life it has reduced the number of claims made upon the funds of societies for funeral expenses. Deaths certified, 305, not certified, 20, no medical attendance, 20, ooroners' inquests, 19 "
The deaths in Yorkshire amounted to 10,217, while the number in the corresponding quarter of 1855 was 9,421. The increase occurs in Leeds and the surrounding districts, where the sanitary state of the population has been neglected-in Sheffield, in Doncaster, in Hull and Sculcoates. The registrar of Shipley, Bradford, ascribes the excess of deaths in his sub-district to an " epidemic fever, which has prevailed to an alarming extent throughout the quarter." *"The medical men," he says, ' in the district attributeso much sickness and death to the general system of sewerage now being carried out under the Health of Towns Act, by which old drains are disturbed that have not been opened for generations."
The 5,555 deaths in the Northern counties exceed by only 53 the deaths in the corresponding quarter of 1855. The deaths increased in Durham, and decreased in Cumberland. Scarlatina, which is a highly contagious disease, appears to infest the colliery districts.
A great calamity befell the colliers of Wrexham, in Wales:-
On the 30th of September a sudden and unexpected inundation of a coalmine oocurred at Bryn Mally Colliery, causing the deaths of 14 coalminers who were employed in the mine. By this fatal and melancholy accident 9 widows and 27 children, besides aged relatives, were deprived of their natural means of support.
There is a very marked decrease of the mortality in Merthyr Tydfil. In Carnarvon the mortality increased. In Wales generally the mortality was below the average.

ELECTION INTELLIGENCE.
R A T.T;(R n
The election of a representative for the borough of Salford, in lieu of the late MVr. Brotherton, took place yesterday morning, in the Town-hall. Mr. Heelis, the Mayor, presided, and there were present, besides lr. Langwortby who was the only candidate announced, Mr. J. A. Turner Sir J. Potter, aptainrCarnegie (late h.P. foriStafFord) Mr. J. Dngdale, and Aldermen Agnew, heiggins, Raiford WanMlyn, Hervey, Weston, and ofay, and about 3Ki people. The procedingswere altogetherdevoid of political excitement.
After the usual preliminary formalities, Mr. J. A. Tua. mE a proposed Mr. Edward Riley Langworthy as a fit and proper person to represent the borough in Paribament.
Mr. Alderman hcosids seconded the nomination.
vr. S. PonE, the secretary of the q u nited Kingdom Alliance for the Suppression of Traffic in Intoxicating Liquors, made a lengthy speech, urging on Mr. Langworthy, whose election he supported, his earnest attention to the objects of that association,
MIr. HuLLINg, who said he unfortunately differed from every person present on the question before them, opposed the election of hlr. Langworthy, believing that gentleman to be inconsistent in his application of the excellent principles which he professed.
No other candidate being proposed, the motion was carried unanimously by a show of hands, and
The MAYOR declared Mr. Langworthy to be duly elected as member of Parliament for the borough.
Mr. L"NowonrTIy, who was received with loud applause, then thanked the electors for the honour conferred upon him. He said he had with the greatest reluctance consented to present himself for their suffrages, and that he so offered himself not in the quality of a first-rate legislator, or of a man who could make brilliant speeches, bat as a plain commercial man, knowing the wants of commerce and the wants of his constituency. He believed that in the House of Commons men of all classes were required, and that even among our most efficient legislators the experience of a commerrcial man might be found useful. (Hear, hear.) He had already made known his political principles, and had therefore very little moreto say. He declined to go to Parliament pledged to particular measures, holding that his constituency must trust to his honesty to apply his principles truly. (Hear, hear.) In regard to Mr. Pope's observations he must express his high appreciation of the efforts of those with whom that gentleman acted for a great social benefit, and should heartily eoncur in al sucl means of influencing men from excess as operated on their moral convictions, but he must unhesitatingly say that he was not prepared to vote for the total suppression of the liquor traffic. (Hlear, hear.) He did not think arny law could be enforced, unless it met the approbation of the people, and was adapted to the spirit of the age. The day might come when the public mind would be prepared for such a law, and then would be time enough to consider the question. After many years' experience as a mnagistrato, he must testify to the willingness of the licensed victualers generally to carry out tise law, but he was not prepared to say that better restrictions might not be devised than those now existing against intemperance, and they should have his support. (Hear, hear.) On the question of education he must say he beheved voluntary exertions insufficient; he should support all measures which tended to promote it, and especially the plan of local rating and local management. As a thorough FreetrAder he was for removing aU restrictions on the industry of the country. He supported the Factory Act as a protegtion to women and young people, but would oppose any la'w which interfered with an adult man's right to dispose of his tirne. He was a supporter of civil and religious liberty in the fullest sense of the term. He was sincerely pained to find himself at variance with a considerable portion of his constituency on the subject ef the Maynooth grant. He feared he had been misunderstood, also, with regard to his opinion of Sanday bands. Speaking individually, he did not see in the use of Sunday bands that desecration of the Sabbath which it appeared in the eyes of many good and pious men; bhut he did not feel the value of those bands so important as to lead him to vote for offending the consciences of a large portion of the population. (Hear, hear.) He was in favour of a reform of the representation, to a large extent, but believed we should have long to waitfor it, unless the people showed themselves more alive to its importance than at present. He would support all social reforms, and hoped that Parliamnent would endeavour to redeem the time lost during the war. He would be a steady and firm advocate for economy and retrenchment, and was strongly opposed to a large increase of our military force. (Applause.) We had now a force more costly and much more powerful then all the nations of Europe together, and, if we emulated them in their military establishments, we should be subject to a taxation whieh would press most heavily on the lower classes. As an advocate of direct taxation, he thought the. Income-tax should not be entireiy removed, but that precarious incomes should not contribute so much as tbose arising from property. He vas strongly opposed to a centralized Government, believing local government to be thebest foundation and safegnard of our liberties. It was the great distinctive power of England that her people could manage their own affairs, while the nations of the continent showed a total absence of ability for self-government. (Hear, hear.) He should go to Parliament not' as a party man, bat to support all measures which he believed for the good of the couznry. (Applause.)
The proceedings concluded vith.1, ypte of tka&,tp± the Mayor.

13LECrrON OF TEHE MASTER OF ST. Joss's COLLEGY.
The FeRows of St. John's College assembled in the chapel, at 9 o'clock this morning, when the Rev. William Henry Bateson, B.D., one of the Senior FeUows, Pablic Orator of the University, and member of the Council of the Senate, was elected Master. Mr. Bateson graduated in the year, 1836, when he was third on the Classical Tripos, and Senior Optime. He was for some years a distinguished classical pnrivate tutor, but never held the office of tutor, or even of Iecturer in his college, his political opinions bein' regarded as a disqualification. The Rev. Francis France, .D.f one of the tutors, was a candidate for the Mastership, and was warmly supported; butAir. France, findingthatthemajority was with Mr. Bateson, retired before the day of electidn. 29 Fellows were present, of whom 26 voted for Mr. Bateson, and threo for the Rev. F. W. Collison, rector of Marwood, Devon, a late FeUow. The election is highly honour, able to the Society, as it is well-known that the new Master entertains academical as well as political opinions at variance with those of many of the Flleows, and, indeed, with the collegiate traditions of a century and a-half.
The electioii is also most satisfactory to the University at large, for, in addition to Nr. Bateson's weU known aptitude for business, his having held the office of secretary to the first University Commission renders him qualified to contribute valuable aid in the deliberations necessarily consequent on the recent act of Parliament for the reform of the University.

Legal Accident.
LEGALD ACCIDENT.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-The London and North-Western Railway Com. pany have hit upon a notable mode of slaying the slain. I brought certain charges against the officials who arrested Hr. Temple at the Rugby station, and, in order to get rid of the reflections they cast upon the company, the directors instruct their solicitor to write to their !ecre. tary, stating that my assertions are u"true, and then order thoir secretary to write to The Tomes enclosing their solicitor's letter. So that they who read as they run will run away with the notion that Mr. Brady's statement has been contradicted by the directors, by their secretary, and by their solicitor; when, in fact, the contradiction is only that of the latter officer, repeating in 1857, on behalf of a railway company put upon its defence, what he alleged in 1853 for the same company, when it occupied the position of prosecutor. His statement is a one-sided statement, and, considering how long he has been in getting it up, and to how very little it amounts, it would have been better, I think, not to make it at alL Air. Carter charges me with two discrepancies, neither of which. is material to the main fact-the guilt or innocence of Temple; while, though the first raises only a formal objection touching the precise route by which Temple was travelling and the ticket found upon him, aud the other goes to deny that he was refused the means of corunmnicating with his friends while at Rugby, the allegation of discrepancy in both instances rests solely on the evidence of the offioils implicated. Observe, Sir, that in the amply detailed statement which I forwarded to you Mr. Carter, with his company to back him, and writing without personal responsibility for what he alleges, has only been able to pick two holes, which may be no holes after all. The objection as to the route is quite immaterial; and, as to the other discrepancy, how is that got rid of? Why a railway solicitor, engaged to defend the conduct of its officers, calls upon a Mr. Chamberleyne, an inspector of rural police, to give his version of the transaction. Mr. Ch.mberleyneis himself an interested party, and were he to admit the truth of what I have said he would be holding himself up to the world as a monster of cruelty. And so he sits quietly down, and writes off a certificate of good conduct in favour of hirmself, remembering, no doubt, the old adage that dead men tell no tales. I have given Mr. Temple's statement as he gave it to his wife and sister in Coventry Gaol. Mr. Carter has given the statement of the railway officials and the Rugby inspector Statement B contradicts statement A, statement A contra. dicts statement B, and when al is done the case stands where it did. Not a word has been said to shake the belief that an innocent man was rashly arrested, and his wife and children flung helpless upon the world.
Mr. Carter, whether from want of confidence in his case or from a professional habit of caution, makes frequent use of the phrase "it appears," so that I am left in doubt whether he makes his statements absolutely, or only to the best of his belief. Let me ask whether, since he read my first letter in Tlhe Times, it has ever " appeared" to him worth while to go into the main question,-viz., the possibility of Mr. Temple's innocence. Ifheis not averse from this, and if the directors of the London and North-Westem Railway Company really wish well to the widow and. orphans, I would invite his and their attention to the report of the trial, containing the evidence of the principal witness for the prosecution, the owner of the carpetbag. I havebefore me a copy of the Coventry Herald and Obshecrv
of March 24, 1853, which contains such a report, and I confess that since I have perused it I am more convinced than ever, not of the innocence of poor Temple, but of the gross misconduct of the railway officials in arresting him at al. Read for yourself, Sir:-
I"John Gorst, Deputy-Clerk of the Peace for Preston. said,-He had occasion to go to London. When he arrived at Stafford his carnage was empty. He had a carpetbag with him, and placed it or. the seat before him. There was no one in the carriage from Preston to Stafford. When prisoner got in at Stafford he had no luggage with him. Told witness he was proceeding to Rugby by order of the station-mastor at Stafford to look for some luggage he had left; when he arrived at Rugby the prisoner lefc his seat and got out of the carriage the moment the train stopped; when be got out he saw prisoner make a spring aucL get over the grappling irons that connected his carriage with the one behind him. When he returned to the carriage he missed his carpetbag. He communicated his loss to the superintendent of the company. They searched the carriage. The train went on. About 20 minutes after he went into the refreshment-room, and saw the prisoner at the bar, aud gave him into custody. The carpetbag was put on the table of the refreshment-room. It had his name on an engraved plate. There were 25. in 61. Bank of England notes, 10 sovereigns, with a quantity of wearing apparel.
Prisoner was the only person that came with him in the car.- riage when they came from Stafford."
Was there ever such hot-headed precipitancy, such rashly confident jumping at conclusions? Mr. Gorst had a carpetbag; he and the prisoner travelled in the same carriage; on arrival of the train at Rugby the latter got out, and Mr. Gorst saw him make a spring and get over the grappling-irons that connected his carriage with the one behind him (an infalible proof of his felonious intention) ; then Gorst himself left the carriage, and returning presently found his bag gone. Who could have taken it but Temple? His conduct was as like that of a thief as Monmouth is like Mfacedon. As there was a river in Macedon and a river in Monmouth, and salmon in both, there was at Rugby an owner of a bag and a loser of a bag, just as there would bave been had Temple been a real " swell-mobs. man." But now, Sir, mark what follows. The train passed on. Gorst remained, no doubt looking about for his pro. perty, for the space of 20 minutes, at the end of which time Mr. Temple and Mr. Gorst's carpetbag were found taking their ease in the refreshment-room, the bag reposing on the table gazing reproachfully at the thief, andathe thief as calmly glorying in his shame before waiters. passengers, policemen, and aU comers and goers. It would indeed appear, Sir, that there is a discrepancy between my account of this deplorable affair and the true state of the facts; and it may well be that, in the fever and agony of their grief, the husband and his wife and sister may in some minor partieulars of their statement have been incorrect; but they have not erred on their own side. Here comes the principal witness for the prosecution, the owner of the bag, and discloses a caee, I think I may justly say, of scandalous impropriety ou the part of the offcials Why, Sir, from Mr. Gor6t's own account of the matter it does not even appear that Temple ever touched the bag. It is certain that he let the carriage before Gorst, and that the bag was in the carriage after the two travellers got out. Who can tel by what hands it was carried from the train to the refreshment-room; and what tiro of the swell-mob would not be ashamed of the bungler who would carry his " swag" into the most conspicuous part of the station, and stand by it there to be the observed of all observers for the space of nearly half as kour?
I think, Sir, we must find another term for this case than "Legal Accident." It was, indeed, a-n accident, and a the railway offiials it wPals mis5cohnduct,£ . on which inr my humble opinion, it would be difficult to finda term of reprehension too strong.
I have the honour to he, S.ir, your obed.et aervant.

The Convict Question.
THE CONVICT QUEsTION.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIIES.
Sir,-As the disposal of our convicts continues to he discussed in your columns, I would- ask. the favour of your allowing me to offer a few explanations concerning the different classes of convicts, the expenses, &c., As data for the farther consideration of the subject.
The great and varied talent which has been bronght to bear upon the question, and the numerous plans that have been proposed, have served to show that there exist many practical difficulties in regaining, in any form, the advantages we b3fore possessed in transferring to other regicns almost the whole of the convicts, and among them our worsand most dangerous criminals.
It has been shown that we cannot now so dispose of them without creating elsewhere the evils we do not desire to endure at home, and that wherever the attempt might be made it would probably create evils of great magnitude.
Before entering upon figures I would beg yonr atiention to the fact that among convicts there will be found every shade of character, and that at the least it may safely be said that some of them are better than others.
It will facilitate the means of discussion, though I fear It may do a violence to the feelings of some of your readers, to go so far as to admit that there are these degrees of comparison; and for convenience we will divide them into two classes-the begt and the worst.
The number of male convicts annually sentenced to transportation and penal servitude in the last three years has been about 2,300. For the sake of illustration, therefore, I will take 2,500 as the number with whom we shall have to deal.
The most experienced officers in the convict service would classify them broadly as follow.
L The Worst Classes.-Habitual criminals, who will return to crime on release; about 20 per cent-500.
2. The Best Class.-Or those who wiiU prefer ordinary ocCupationfromhavingacquiredbetter habits, onbeing deterred from crime; about 60 per cent.-1,oO0.
3. Invalids, boys, and others; 20 per cent.-500.
On these data it will appear that of the two main classes the worst amounts, in round numbers, to 500; the best, to 1,00.
Now, as regards the disposal of these men after they have endured their respective terms of penal servitude, it may safely be assumed that from one-half to two-thirds of the best class will have fair prospects of employment at home. They will have friends ready to help them, or a trade to fall back upon, or might find some one to be security for their good behaviour.
As regards the worst lass, if they be deprived of the facilities that exist at home for exercising their profession, whether as receivers of stolen goods, swell-mobsmen, burglars, or pickpockets, they too, to the extent perhaps of one half, would be inclined to try their hands at some employment or other, for want of (what in their eyes might be) " something better to do."
They would have had hard work enough at Portland, Gibraltar, or Bermuda, to spoil their hands for some of the more delicate manipulations of their art, and to qualify them for downright hard labour.
This consideration again diminishes our difficulties, for they would not stand with their hands in their pockets, but direct their energies into better courses, and, if once they did so, would become valuable settlers; many have done sO before in the Australian colonies.
If experience has afforded any foundation for these data, it would appear that after deducting those wvho would bi acceptable, and could be absorbed in Western Australia, and those who might be released at home, without entailing any prejudicial consequences, the worst and only dangerous class to the interests of society is, in reality, very small probably not exceeding 250 to 300 yearly.
The greatest difficulty is obviously how to deal with thi small section, and in despair of a penal colony for them the safest advice would appear to be " when yoe have them under look and key, keep them there as long as you caD."
If detained during sufficiently long sentences of penal servitude their associations would be broken up and their pro. pensities somewhat modified. If released at home after this probation the active co-operation of the police must do the rest, and a sentence for life should follow their subsequent detection in crime.
Having said thus much respecting numbers and means at disposal, I would ondeavour to correct some insapprehen. Sion which exists on the matter of expense.
The following is a statement of the cost of a convict at PentonviDe and Portland resne.tvlv *_
I1 nave troubled you with this detail in order to show the cost of diet, clothing, fuel, light, medicines, and other et ceteras under the head of maintenance, as distinguished from the salaries of officers, which, it will be observed, amount to,nearly one-half the annual expense of a convict.
If objections arise I would explain that a large staff of discipline officers is necessary on several grounds:-The authorities must be ready at all times for any emergency that may arise; they may be, and generaUy are, at peace but in order to preserve it they must be prepared for war They are responsible for safe custody, yet convict labour must be applied miles beyond the prison walls, &c.
As regards the chaplains' department, which is no inconiiderable item, enough has been said to discourago their Exertions, or the efforts of prisoners to profit by them, but let no one doubt the usefulness of religious and moral in*truction, or the fact that even as a question of finance the advantages secured by it are in their results far more economical than the very cheapest appliances of a simply coercive discipline.
From these statements it will appear that an able-bodied convict undergoing his sentence of four years' penal serntude, during nine months of which lie is in separate confinement and three years and three months working at Portland or Gibraltar, is not so costly to the Government as is generally supposed. While undergoing separate confinement, which is essential to any success in reforming him, he costs at the rate of 21. a-year, because he earns but little towards his maintenance.
On fortifications and breakwaters, in dockyards and arsenals, he works, however, as hard as any other artificer or labourer; and but for the amount chargeable for officers to control and instruct him would earn in that which is strictly maintenance much more thaa he costs. In fact, the confiscated labour of convicts, applied in meeting the pressing demand which everywhere exists, while it proves a heavy penal infliction, affords the best means of training the men to industrious habits. Inetead of being an expensive system, it is by far the cheapest and best way of working out the sentence of the law that was ever devised, and this consideration shows that there is little difficulty and no great expense incurred in keeping men in confinement for long periods.
The class of invalids and boys, forming about 20 per cent. Of the whole, are necessarily more costly.
At Dartmoor and Parkhurst, where agricultural employmeat is necessarily resorted to, though the farms are models of cultivation and very productive, the profits, when everything is charged, are inconsiderable.
As regards the means of disposal, however, it will simplify the view to confine attention to the able-bodied convicts, on whom we may assume that some 35L or 40. has been expended in four years.
If after this strictly penal part of his sentence he were transported or banished, the additional expense incurred in thus disposing of him wonld depend so much upon circumstances that it cannot be accusately stated.
The gross expense of each convict sent to Western Australia has been estimated at 1001. per head. If a really dangerous man were acceptable there, his absence from our home circle would be cheaply purchased at that amount; but such men are precisely those whom the colonists are not so willing to receive as we are to spare; measures are therefore still required for their safe custody, or their due . ontrol when released.
Many allusions have been made to the superior diet and clothing and comforts in prisons, as compared with the wretchedness in which too many of our poor people live.
The degree of cleanliness and good order that are so essential in large establishments always convey an impression of comfort to those who look on, but it sometimes conveys a different impression to those who have to endure it.
In explanation, I would beghere to submit a few remarks on this subject which appear in my report for 1853:-
"The enforcement of cleatlinesg and regularity on th dissolute and reckless characters which form the average prison population is not only essential as a means of reformation, but may fairly be taken as £ wholesome and legitimate element of punishment."
" In this double character all bo *ttractive appearancee of cleanliness and good order may saely be viesed, They sre not the result of any undue elsire to admisilstu- to the e4mfort of a prisoner, but the wksik d of t1& daily
zoutine by which they are secured is calculated to thwart tho natural tastes and habits of most criminals, and to divert them into nerw and inproved channels."
It creates also habitual self-controL When a prisoner finds cleanliness and self-respect really conducive to hii comfort he is in the way to profit permanently by the discipline.
As regards diet also, whoever hears that a convict hat
four or five ounces of meat every day, with a good supply of i bread and potatoees cocoa for breakfast, and gruel for supper, may well exclaim that thousands of our honest poor are not so well off.
There is no question on this point; tbe roal question is
whether a less diet would be sufficient. All that I cnm say | is, the wvhole subject has been carefully considered over and I over again; extended experimenss have been made under the highest medical authorities, and the result has been the conclusion that a diet containing nutriment to the extent of the scales established at Pentonville and Portland is essential, as a general average, to support the men against the depressing influences of imprisonment, or to enable them to execute in addition the hard labour required of them.
For short terms " short commons" is a most efficient and deterrent element of prison discipline; but during those which now commence at a minimum of four years a liberal diet to support health and fit a wan on discharge to earn his living is quire indispensable.
HXoping that the foregoing explanations may serve as useful daoin the consideration of thu questions to which they refer,
I aun. Sir. vour obedient aerva,4

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-In 27ic Times, I think of Thursday, I read an account of a meeting of ticket-of-leave men, in which one of the men states that the numerous cases of garotting and robberies that have taken place lately in the suburbs of London are mostly committed by militiamen. Now, I can fully corroborate that assertion, or, at al events, place implicit belief in it, from what has transpired in my own town and neighbourhood. Perhaps yoa may deem the following facts worthy of notice and give them aplaco in your paper, for the purpose of calling attention to the evils arisiDg from letting loose upon the country the gamins of our large towns.
During the early part of the winter scarcely a night passed without some house or houses being burglarionsly entered and property stolen. My own house was attempted, and almost every house in the vicinity of Lanark. From one of the last houses broken into two watches and several other articles were stolen. Notice was given to the police of Glasgow of the number of the watches, and the chief on presenting them for pawn was apprehended, and he turned out to be a militiaman. His trial has not come on, but I hope he will be convicted. Lee-house, the residence of Lady Lockart, was broken into, and a quantity of groceries stolen therefrom. Another discharged militiaman was suspected, his house searched, sugar and candles of a superior quality and in greater quantities than he could afford to purchase wore found. This was not held proof enough for conviction, though I should have considered it sueb, unless he could have proved where these articles were purchased. Since the apprehension of these men no robbery has taken place.

Probable Policy Of The Chinese Government.
PROBABLE POLTCY OF THa CE[IhES8 GOVER,m-NfT. -We shall be sincerely pleased if the Americans are led by the recent occurrences in which they have been engaged to take active part in the work of accomplishing the humilia. tion of Canton, a work which belongs as much to them as to us. Bnt we fear it is doubtful if they take further steps unless forced on by the acts of Yeli, whose folly and obstinacy remind one of the Pharaobs of old, when their hearts were hardened to their own undoing. We do not question the readiness of the gallant commodore who now commands on this station, bat his Excellency Dr. Parker is known for his pacific disposidion and his inclination to temporizing measures, and through his influence the quarrel, as far as his country is concerned, rnay be patched up. But we may wel leave the discussion of these matters to our Southern conteinporaries. The point that concerns us is whether the troubles at Canton wiU lead to general war; whether the Emperor will take the side of his Viceroy to the detriment of his own interests, or whether, sacrificing his pride and inclination to the necessities of his situation, he will sedulously keep the peace elsewhere, leaving Yeh to make the most of his bad bargain at Canton. The first intelligence received at Pekin of the dissensions with ouar authorities will doubtless be to the effect that we have joined the rebel party and entered into war against the Imperial Government. This cannot be agreeable news to men, who, however lofty their pretensions and impenetrable their selfconceit, mnust be conscious of the doubtful issue of the intestine struggle in which they are already engaged, and who, by their own admissions, are pressed for men and money to meet present exigencies. They will await with impatience and apprehension for news from the other ports, and their relief Will be equal to their former fears when the lieutenants of His elestial Majesty inform themthatpeace continues, and that the whole matter is considered by the English as a local difference to be settled on the spot. Let us suppose, however, for the sake of argument, so rash a frame of mind in His Majesty as that, influenced by the representations of his favourite, Yeh, he should send orders to the vicoroys to stop the passage of produce to the ports, and of imports inward, in hopes of forcing us into conciliatory measures by the fear of losing our rade. Isittoba believed that his representatives, even now at their wits' end to devise ways and meansa, with their soldiers in mutiny for want of provisions and clothing, their private resources utterly exhausted, will cut off one of their most unfailing sources of supply without the most strongly urged remonstrances? The income derived by the Imperial Government from foreign trade, with that portion of the duties colected which deows into the pockets of the provincial officials, is not only the amount shown by the returns of the Custom-house; much more is now collected at interior posts than at the outports, and the total revenue from the two ports of Shanghai and Foochow, reckoning theexactions cn routc, cannot be less than $5,000,000. In case of interruption these interior duties would be lost as completely as those at the ports, as the produce would remain in packhouses, or be consumed in a way which would not yield an especial revenue. We venture to say that it is utterly impossible for the Government officers to give up at a stroke this large yearly income, when harassed as they now are for even inconsiderable sums, and we seriously believe that, if forced by the necessity of circumstances to do it at this crisis, the greater part of them would resign their posts or cut their throats in despair. We therefore entertain no apprehensions of an interruption to our peaceful relations at the Northern ports, but, on the contrary, believe that the authorities will show more than ordinary solicitude to preserve friendly feeling, and prevent such a disaster to them as a repetition at their ports of the scenes at Canton could not fail to be.-North C/sina Hcra/s.
FmNGCx MAcRm iy.-The following is the report of the executive committee presented to the second annual meeting of factory occupiers held at the Town-hall, Manchester, on Tuesday, January 27 :-"It will be remembered that at the time of the last anmual meeting the committee had just succeeded in obtaining through one of the prosecations of theinspectors of factories,-viz., that againAt Messrs. Sheppard, of Frome-a conclusive interpretation of the 21st clause of the 7th and 8th of Victoria, cap. 15, which required that 'aU parts of the mil gearing in a factory shaU be securely fenced.' This case was taken to the Court of Queen's Bench, under the title of Sheppard against Doel, and on the 18th of January, 18-56, Lord Campbell and two other judges decided that the expressions of the act reqaired a specific fence or guard to al shafts, no matter to what extent they might be constructively fenced by height or other circumstances. This deci,ion was given only a few days before the last annual meeting, and it was then expected that the Government would have passed a short biU to modify such a vexatious and unnecessary requirement. This expectation was, however, disappointed, and the committee, in accordance with the powers intrusted to them, and with the approbation of the council of the association, at once nndertook the laborious and expensive task of preparing and introducing into the House of Commons an independent biUl for the accomplishment of the object desired. This biU was carried, with a slight alteration, suggested by the Government, throngh both Houses, and on the 15th of June, 185'6, received the Royal assent; a copy of it was afterwards sent to each member of the association. The committee and the factory interest at large are deeply indebted to Colonel Wilson Patten, Lord Stanley, and the Right Hon. the Earl of Derby for the handsome manner in which they took charge of the bil in their respective houses, for their great interest in its success, and for their clear and convincing expositions of its objects, and of the circumstances which rendered it necessar,. The committee must nOt omit to acknowledge also the willing support the bill received from the representatives generally of the manufacturing districts, and in particular from Mr. T. AL Gibson, whose lucid and forcible statements in his place in the House were of essential service. At the same time they feel called upon to express their regret that among those to whom such acknowledgments are due they cannot include Mr. Cobbett, the memner for Oldham, and Mr. Crook, the member for Bolton-tho former of whom was very violent in his opposition to the biUl, and divided the Rouse both upon ib preamble and its essential claims, but only to exhibit on each occasion a very large majority in favour of the bill as promoted by the committee. The committee ought further to state that valuable assistance and advice were received from other members of tho House of Commons not immediately connected with manufactures, several of whom gave their aid in the debates, and materiaUy contributed to the success of the bill. There was, in fact, amonE the members, with one or two exceptions, an absence of that hostility to the manufacturing interest which has marked previous debates on such subjects, and a desire to remove from the law a provision shown to be vexatious and unnecessary. The progress of the biil through the House of Lords did not present any features of particular interest. Prior to the introduction of the measure your committee waited upon Lord Shaftesbury in reference to it, who expressed his approval in general terms of the principle of arbitration, but they regretted to find that his Lordship felt obliged to oppose the bill in the House from some alarm as to its incidental effect, which your committee were not able to understand. Your committee are not aware of any case of arbitration having arisen since the statute was passed, but they feel confident its provisions will afford ample protection to the operatives and will prove satisfactory to the employers. Since the last annual meeting the attention of your committee has been occupied by the cases of I 'Crackan v. Dargan, and Another,' of Dablin and I Munro v. Chadwick,' of Aberdeen; in the former of webic, in respect of an accddent which happened 1S months before the commencement of the action, the jury awarded damages to theaextentof200., andin the latter, promoted bythe Poor Law authorities, a verdict has notyet been given In both these cases your committee gave carefal consideraton ,to the circumstances of eich, and were fuly assured before mudertaking the defence thnt they were cases entitled to the Any~prt of She associstion,"1

THrE SERPENTINE Rn`ER, HYDE PARsc.-The banks; om.. each side of this river, yesterday wero densely cro ded, while the carriage roads were igi with rsch equipyges Upwards of 9,00U persons ventured upon the ice; bu, in so doing, the crowd congregating near the best skaterscaused the ice to break, and the oonsequence was that P. gentlemau named William Dowell, who came foia B tom.- ley, in Kent, to enjoy a day's skating, broke thogh theice and, together with a friend who accompanied him
became immersed inl2 feet of water at the east end of thoriver. Fortunately, they were rescued by William Cox, one of the Royal Humane Socieys icemen, by meansof the breaker-ladders. They were removed to the receivig^ house, and after some time were able to go home. During the afternoon the ice commenced breaking up owing: to the thaw setting in so rapidly, and, by direction of Mrx Supeintendent Williams, Feveraltthousands left off skating and sEliding, but even as late as 8 o'clock last night a t number insisted upon remaining on the ice, and, in the event of the frost continuing, they stated that theyintended to have a grand pyrotechnical display and midnight match for sundry prizes upon the ice in this pork.
THE L0.%G-WYATXR IN KENSINGTON-GARDYENS.-Om
this ornamental water, yesterday, there was a great deal of excellent skating, but the ico gave way, and 11 persons became immersed in seven feet of water. Mr. W. Valker, of 16. Norfolk-crescent, was rescued by iceman Griffin, with. the sledge, at some risk, and the others were able to go to, their respective h'omes.
THlE ROtnD POND, KENSINGTON-GARDEN.-TheI, siders and skaters upon this pond yesterday amounted toabout 1.500, but no immersion of any conseluence oocurred. Mr. Wilson, son of Captain Wilson, of 33, Balnbridge-
terrace, however, fell on the ice and put his shoulder outof joint. Ho was picked up by Joseph Knight, onb of the icemen, who placed him on the sledge and took him. ashore, when he was conveyed by some gentlemen to his home.
THE RxGENT'S PARXL-Owing to the judicious instruc-. tions given by Deputy Superintendent Parsons not more. than 4,500 persons ventured upon the ice, and no accidentworthy of notice occurred.
THE VICTORIA P,iRK had a great many visitors, and several persons were cat severely about the heads, but no immersion of any serious character occurred.
By half-past 10 o'clock last night the thermometer began.. rapidly to fall, indicating that the frost was likely to continue.

THE Rr&srL%.N BOUNDARY QUESTIoN.-A map, or rather two maps, and a sketch, have just been published,
under the authority of Her Majesty's Secretary of State for* War, which show at a glance the manner of the final disposal of that long vexed question the Bolgrad boundary. Each point is carefully traced, both with reference to the, Moldavian towns and the delta of the Danube. The sketch gives Lake Yalpuck, with the towns of Bolgrad and abhak, taken from a tumulus in the lower waU of Trajan. With this, also, is a small plan, on which is marked the line of frontier as it would have been if Bolgrad were Russiran
and the same line as it would have been determined on had. the disputed town been that within the limits of the Moldavian territory. Those who study these charts wil be enabled to perceive at a glance the peculiar nature of the deception which was attempted to be passed upon the Paris Conference, and the material benefits which would have been retained by our late enemy had her efforts on this point. been successful. The smalUer of the charts, 'which shows the - Delta of the Danube, as affected by the now decided boundary, ilustrates the real importance of the question in a cons clusive manner.
ROCIDALE WOOL.-3Ionday.-In anticipation of a further advance in prices at the forthcoming sales holders evince little dosihon to accept late rates, at which a fair busiuess might he done. Under these circumstances, the actual business of the day has been confined to purchasesnecessitated by immediate wants.
ROCDBAi FLArNNEL.-Monday.-The partial
advance of last week has to-day been fully established, i:L our markeat may be quoted fully Is. higher. With this advanco, howover, complaints are rife as to the unreamunerativo character of the flannel trade. It is satisfactory,
underthese circumstances, to find that our manufacturers. are fully employed on orders, and that the mills are running full time. One of the largest firms-that of Messrs Kel-
sal-is largely engaged in supplying fancy flannels forshirtings.
