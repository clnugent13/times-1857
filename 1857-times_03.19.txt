PAMINB in FINLAND.-It is well knowna to
Lmany that at the present moment there is an urgent claim for .ymp)atby and ASSISTANCE on behalf of the distressed inhabitants If Finland.
The almost total failure of the crops of Lnst yenr hall brought aboout 6stAte o1 absolute want and famine, which uniess alleviated by speedy aipplies mus3tlsa4to very disastrous results. The autumn sown crops 3ave alsol been cut off by the severe frost, and threatens a continuanea Af the famine through another season, as the people fare consuming their seed corn.
Theze sufferings have been aggravated on some parts of the coast by the losses brought, on the unolfendin.F inhabitants during the war the
settle and stores of the peasanseib av ne been carried off, and the beet
end note of the dlabermen destroyed. The imritation arising out of these acts haa been er great, and the feeling of hostilty to Enlgland and the English Is openy manifested among the people.
In the hope of alleviating the great distress now exisftig, and also of allaying some of the hostile feeling caused by the WAr, a commnIttee has been organized to raise mioney on behalf of the Ftos, and has already sent out instructions to purchase and distribute food.
The Commaittee will report to the subscribers the application of the fundsr, and further particulars and circulars may be bad of the Serertartes-oes. CroessSeld and Edward Mfarsh, 81, Hoendsdteb

Prom ".The Times" of February, 17, 12857:-" Accounts from St. Petersburg. up to the 7th instant, g;ve a very melancholy picture of the sontinued general distress and want borderinig upon positive famine, axisting throughout the Grand Ducl'iof Finland, and which threatens to become daily wimse. Notwthstaudsng the amounts subscribed at gt. Petersburg, Helalngfors, and other places for the alleviation of the q.xisting evils, )the Emperor and Empress hive given 10,000 and 5,000 silver roubles respectively for this purpose, nd large supplies from the military magazines have been placed at the disposal of the yo irer llasae-, at very low prices, to aid and assis them, hut this aid ts of -
temporary character; the popuation are in maany parts, perishing of buDger and cold. The merchants and other moneyed men have subo;cribed In the capital about 28,000 silver rDubles ; among them Baron 3teiglirr is down for 10,000 roubles. The authorities ar at their wits

PUBLIC MEETINGS.
FMINSBITR
Last evening Major Reed, one of tho candidates for this borough, addressed an open-air meeting on Saffron. bill. The gallant major, who spoke from the window of the Coopere' Arms, was introdaced by Mr. Humphrey Williams, chairman of the meeting. He said that he hA ben charged by his opponents with being a Conservative.
He otay denied the imputation, He thought himself entitled to their support from the strenuous opposition which he had made to the war 9d. He was a sup. porter of administrative reform, being of opinion that the notorious nepotism which had prevailed should be at once put an end to, and that all the public offices should be thrown open to competition. Before they could have administrative reform it was absolutely necessary that they should have Parliamentary reform, and for that reason he was in favour of the extension of the franchise. He confessed, however, that the subject of the grvnt to Maynooth was a question moSt difficult to approach; and, inasmuch as he looked upon it as a return for the support of the established church in Ireland, he had voted against Mir. Spooner's motion. But
it was the opinion of the electors that that grant should not be continued, he was prepared to modify his opinions. He had always voted with Sir W. Cly for the abolition of church-rates, considering that everyman who contributed to the taxation of the country was entitled to have a voice in the disposal of the money. He was in favour of extending the suffrage, at all events, to the extent of Locke King's motion. (Cries of " Oh ! oh l") Without vote by baUot he thought the extension of the suffrage would be nothing but an injury to the voter. He was of opinion that they should leave the education of the people to voluntary efforts. If any attempt was made to continue the income-tax beyond 1860 he should give it his most strenuous opposition. He believed that Lord .Palmerston was the man of the day, and strongly condemned the coalition against him. At the conclusion of his address several questions were put by voters, to all of which satisfactory answers
were given; and on his retiring he was greeted with loud 1 cheers, Mr. O'Brien then proposed, and Mr. D. Chinery seconded, the following resolution:-
" Resolved, that naVing heard from Major Beed an expresion of his political principles this meeting cordiaDy recognizes his paramount claim to the representation ot the borough of Flosbury, and will use its beat efforts to secure his triumphant return."
The resolution, on being put, was carried unanimously. Several other addresses were made; and the proceedings which were altogether of a harmonious character, were brought to a close by a vote of thanks to the Chairman.
SOUTHWARK
SIR ChARLReS NAPIX A17D 'HIS CoVSTI,UyS.
Last evening a crowded meeting of the electors of Southwark was held at Mr. Herbert Smith's premises, Queenstreet, Bermondsey New-road, for the purpose of hearine an address from Admiral Sir Charles Napier, MP. The electors assembled in the open space, and received the address from a platform erected outside one of the tan-houses. Great interest was attached to the proceedings in consequence of the determination of Mr. Apsley Pellatt to resign his pretensions for the further suffrages of the constituents. Wit the exception of the Admiral there are no other candidates in the field than Mr. J. P. Locke (one of the city pleaders). It is, however, understood tha' if bMr. Scovell, who has several times unsuccessfaUy contested the borough, will not stand, M fr. Serjeant Ballantine will come forward as a candidate.
Shortly after 6 o'clock Mr. Stockhill, the tanner, was caled on to preside. He said he would not trouble them with any lengened observations, but he felt that there was not a vote that Sir Charles Napier had given that the electors could find fault with, and therefore he thought they could not do better than again return him as their representative. With regard to the recent vote, he must defend the conduct of the Government; and as to Sir John Bowring, he was one of those men who had promulgated the anti-corn law movement, and was also a member of the Peacc Society; and therefore he felt that Sir John Boe7ring, as a peaceful and amiable man would not have resorted to such severe measures but that he felt the insult offered to the British fiag should be resented. (Cheers.)
Sir CHARtLzS NA^iB then addressed the meeting, and was loudly cheered on rising. He proceeded to refer to the manner in which Lord Pa'merston had so vigorously conducted the late war with Russia, contending that when the war broke out neither the army nor navy were in a fit state to carry it out, and it was not till Lord Paltuerston came into ohce that the army and navy were properly organi7ed, and consequently the war was brought to a conclusion and
ace obtained - not so good a peace as might, perhaps, ave been had, tut stiU better than carrying on a disastrous and most expensive war. (Cheers.) That war, however, was scarcely over before the Premier found himself in another war in Persia, and that was terminated by Lord Palmerston (cheers); and then came the great war which caused the adverse vote the other evening in the House. He knew Sir John Bowring and Admiral Seymoar well, and they were most humane men. The Chinese dragged the men out of the vessel and tore down the flag before the pblic eye, Sir John Bowring demanded that the mien should be returned and an apology made in an equally public manner; but this was not done, and the authorities took the stepas they considered necessary for the protection of the British flag. He thought they had acted quite right (cheers), and it was for that reason he supported the measures that Lord Palmerston had taken. (Cheers.) If the officers who were sent out were not protected by the Government, they would never find a proper officer to go out to any foreign station. (Hear, hear.) He next came to the coalition that carried the adverse vote, and contended that it was composed of men of all parties seeking for place. In fact, he thought Mr. Cobden was the only honest man among them. (Hear.) They were caUed Peelites, but he thought "renegades" would have been better, " Oh!" and " Hear.") Sir Robert Peel was, however, one of the best statesmen of the day (cheers); but he never meant the income-tax to touch the poor, only the rich. (Cheers.) He thought that some eeonomy should be exercised in the maintenance of the army and navy, but still not to that extent that would endanger the defences of the country. (Cheers.) It was the want of economy in carrying on the war that caued the deaths of the 30,000 men who had died out in the Crimea. After some further remarks as to the management of the army and navy, he expressed his approval of promotion by examination, and also to the extension of the suffrage. He would also support triennial Parliaments if they had the vote by ballot, and he trusted they would al work hard to obtain it, and not let a single man go into Parliament unless he promised to support it. In conclusion, ho promised that, if he were again returned, he should alkays feel it his duty as well as his pleasure to represent them to the utmost of his ability. (Loud cheers.)
Mr. C. LEGGE then moved a resolution to the effect that, having heard the statement of Admiral Sir C. Napier, the meeting was of opinion he was the most fit and proper person to again represent them in Parhament, and the electors pleuge themselves to use their utmost endeavouar to secure his re-election.
Dr. EvANs having briefly seconded the motion, after a few remarks from Mr. Pridmore on the question of Sunday recreation, it was put and carried amid loud cheering.
Three cheers were given for Sir Charles Napier; and a vote of thanks to the chairman terminated the proceedings.
LAMBETH.
Last evening Mr. RoupeU addressed upwards of 700 of the electors of this borough at Hawkestone-hal
Waterloo-bridge-road. Mr. RoupeU said he had come forward in consequence of having been called on from all parts to represent his native borough. With regard to his political and general principles, he deemed Parliamentary and administrative reform imperatively necessary, and was prepared to support vote by ballot, with a large extension of the 101. franchise. With these hopes and wishes he solicited their saiffrages, pledging himself to withstand any propositions for grants for religious purposes, to advocate the total aboltion of church-raies, and such a reduction of the public expenditure as would make the income-tax unnecessary. At the conclusion of the hon. candidaWs address the following resolution was passed by acclamation :
" That this meeting having heard Mr. Ronpell's exposition of his political principles, Is of opinion shut he is a fit and proper candidate to represent the borough of TAmbeth in the Commons House of Parliament, and pledges itself to use every effort to secure his election."
MARYLEBONE.
The Political and Parochial Association of the borough of Marylebone, which numbaers some 300 or 400 electors, held its adjourned meeting on Tucsday evening at the Colosseam tavern, Portland-road, for the purpose of considering the Present state of the representation of the borough in Parliamaent.
Mr. William Field, late churchwarden of Marylebone,
occupied the chair, and the room in which the meeting was held was densely crowded. Among those present wereMessrs. Jacob Bell, Thomas Ross, J. A. Nicholay, M'Evly, DykA, Brinsme ad, Chichester, D'Iffanger, i &c
A resolution was propoded by Mr. MBRxTS3iAD, and seconded by Mr. Rcss at the previous meeting, was to the effect:-
*- That this meeting considers lord Ebrington uafit to represent the borough of Maylebone in Parliament, he being epposed to local self-government, and pledges Itslf to use all its iniluence to prevent bis Lordship being asain returned; and, further, will support those candidates only who wil pledge themselves to lessen, if possible, the powers of the Poor Law Board."
After a long discussion, in the course of which an amendment was proposed by Mr. DYKE, the original resolution was carried with one disntient only, and amid loud applause.
LIVERPOOL.
On Tuesday night a crowded meeting of Liberal electors
and non-electors was held in the Amphitheatre, Mr. Thomas Brocklebank presiding.
Mr. W. RATHBONE, merchant and shipowner, moved the following resolution:-
IThatthenextmeetingofParijament must witness the introduo
tion of a new Reform for the extension of polUtical power among the people, and more completely securing them in the honest ererel, of their privileges on this and other questions In which the rights ana liberties of the people awe deeply conoerned; and that it is the duty of LIberal electors here, and everywbere else, to return men whose opinions and iudependence will not fail them in the time of need."
Mr. T. M. MACKAY, shipowner (of the firm of James Baines and Co., owner of the " Blaok Ball" line of Australian packets), seconded the motion, which was carried by acclamation.
Mr. J. C. EwVART, MP., next addressed tihe meeting, observing that during the short time he had had the honoar of being their representative he had voted not only on every great political question, but upon nearly every question of publc importance which had come before Parliament. His
publc conduct was therefore freely and fairly befove them, and it was upon the votes he had given that be was detercined to abide the issue of the election. He did not blame AIr. Cobden, whose motion was the cause of the dissoln-
tigF b he to W z A' mas of-t pti At
all hazards; but when advanhtge was taken. of that mnotion by certain paTties in the House of Commons to male it a ground of factious oppouition to that Government which he honestly believed to be the only Government practicable at the present moment, be could have no hesitation as to how he ouzht to vote, although, as a man of peace, he greatly deplored anything that would tend to throw this country into a state of war He had hitherto opposed, along with his excellent colleague Mr. Horsfall, and would continue to oppose, all attemnpts i
Parliament to deprive the town of those dues on shipping to w hichjt had a prescriptive right. While wishing to keep the armyand navy in a proper stateeof efficiency, he believed that a great reduction could be made-with advantage to the service. He was favourable to such a change in the law relating to the transfer of land as would make such transfers more easy and practicable to the poor man of this country; he thought, acoording to the existing law, that the duty on tea should be reduced to Is. 3d., and he hoped that the prosperity of the country would justify the speedy removal of the income-tax altogether, but at the same time he declared that he never would be a party to any further charge upon the articles of consumption used by the working classes. He was in favour of vote by ballot and of some plan of edueation for the people.
Mr. G. HOLT, merchant, moved a resolution to the effect:-
al Tit in the optnlonof this meetlogJoseph Ohrktopher Ewart, Eq., has proved himtelf to bo a fit and peoper peont to represent bhe Idberal electors oC Liverpoot in the House of Commons, atd that we pledge ourselves to mike every effort to soure his retanr"
Mr. C. HOLLAND, late President of the Liverpool Cham ber of Commerce, seconded the resolution, which was sup ported by Mr. J. R. Jefferey, and carried unanimously.
AYLESBURY.
Yesterday a large meeting of the electors of Aylesbury was held, to listen to explanations from the two members for the borough, Sir Richard Bethel and Mr. Layard, especially on the subject of the vote on Mr. Cobden's motion. Mr. Acton Tindal was caled to the chair.
Mr. LAYARD, after some facetious remarks on the " carnival" that appears to be in full play in thisasin other localities-the Tory candidate promising to vote for the ballot, the extension of the franchise, removal of Jewish disabilities, &c.,-addressed himself to the question which led to the defeat of the late Government. He said,-I have aid that there is no decided question at present before the country. The only cry that I have heard of is, " Are you a supporter or not of Lord Palmerston's Government ?" Those gentlemen who act with myself have always given the Palmerston Government a firm and consistent support. You are aware, for I have stat'ed it in this hall, that Lord Palterston was good enough to make me an offer of place. I refusedit. Idid not wishtobe sbackled in any way. I have always followed an independent course (cheers), and no offer could induce me to swerve from that course. But there were two or three questions on which I differed from the Palmerston Governsnsnt-questions, as they were called, of Administrative Reform. At that time we thought that the services were not carried on in a way moot conducive to success in war as well as other things. I took a prominent course in that discussion, and I must do Lord Palmerston the justice to say that many and great improvements in various departments of service, since he assumed office, have been effected. Then, there was Locke King's Bill. I know it is said that Lord Palmerston had no wish to oppose the extension of the frauchise, but that he opposed this particular measure because it was not of so large a character, mor proposed in such a way that they could support it with any chance of carrying it through the House. If I bad been a member of the Government there would have been some ground for my reasoning in that way, but as an independent member I had only to ask myself, "A Am I or not for the extension of the franchise ?" and there was only one way of answering, that the franchise should be extended. Therefore I voted against Lord Palmerston. A charge has been made against mnyself and others who think with me, that on a recent occasion we were engaged in a coalition, a conspiracy, a combination, or something of that sort. I can answer for myself, any such charge against me I believe to be utterly false; and I believe Sir R. Bethell, who has the best opportunities of judging of my conduct, will do me the justiee to believe I had no wish to enter into any coalition. When you first sent me to Parliament, the former House of Commons had been dissolved on a question like this. Lord Palmerston opposed Lord John Russell on some question about the miitia,-tho Tories came in, and there was a dissolution; but nobody then accused Lord Palmerston of a coalition. I am certain that Lord Palmerston would not now accuse those members wbo voted independently of a coalition, either with the Tories or with Mr. Gladstone and his friends. I can only answer for myself; but if I am asked my opinion as to Mr. Gladstone and his friends, I don't believe there was any coalition on the part of those gentlemen. We were called on to express an opinion on the question of the Chinese war, -to judge by the papersplaced before us. In that vote there was no hostile feelig against Lord Palmerston's Government; we looked to the real state of things in China. As far as I can Judge by these papers, Sir John Bowring had disregarded the instructions of Sive successive secretaries of State, who told hinm not to moot this question-not to press these claims on the Chinesenot to call for the fulfilment of that part of the treaty relating to the admission of foreigners into Canton. The Government, as we now see, approve entirely of the course which Boning took. Lord Palmerston, at a private meeting, at which I WAS not present, was told by Lord Goderich and others that if he would only say the Government did not confirm the proceedings of Sir J. Bowring, he (Lord Goderich) and others who acted with him would give him their support. But Lord Palmerston replied,-" Sir J. Bowring is the representative of the British Government, and whether he be right or wrong, I think it my duty to support him." That is very chivalrous ground; there is no man who ever held the seals of the Foreign-office more popular with those under him, or who more completely enjoys the confidence of those who serve in that office, because they know they will be supported. But there must be a limit to this, and mny impression Is that Sir J. Bowring erred in every possible way. My opinion is that the gquestion he raised did not justify the steps he took. The hon. gentleman then at some length discussed the question of the Arrow, declaring that he had not voted either as a peace man or a party man, and that, having been entangled in this war, we had no alternative bat to go on withit, but he regretted thatsuch sacrifices should be entailed on us for a question on which the greatest lawyers were divided. He appealed to his votes on the budget and to the cbaracter of those with whom he acted to repel the imputation of factious motives. He believed the result of the present cry would be to place Lord Palmerston at the head, not of a body of Liberals, but of a body of Tories. He had made every sacrifice a public man could make rather than betray Liberal principles, and he was resolved so to do if again returned. He concluded by expressing his entire cordiality of feeling towards Sir Richard Bethell,
Sir R. BET1ELL, after some introductory remarks, commenced a severe attack on the accidental coincidence in opinion which had brought into the same lobby men whose votes could have but one effect, that of bringing a Tory Government into power. He reverted to the time when timid counsels ard irresolute men had reduced this country to the lowest pitch of misfortune, and when the spirit of the country revived when Lord Palmerston assumed the reins of ower and restored our reputation throughout Europe. He then detained the various Liberal measureswhich were in progress before the recent vote, and continued, I want you to observe the difference between considering this matter as it existed when Lord Palmerston was called in to decide it and what it would have been had we now to determine, " hall we or shall we not enter into this war with the Chinese l" Lord Palmerston had no choice in the matter. The question for him was, "Shall I betray and desert those who acted on behalf of England, according to the best oftheir judgment; or shal I maintain the honour of the coRntry? Shall I at once condemn what has assed and place myself under a moral and legal obligation to make compensation for all the losses that have been sustained in consequence of the pressure of our claims i" If Lord Palmerston deemed that Eng. land was wrong, then he was bound to make reparation not only to the Chinso but to every foreigner in the country who had sustained any injury by the proceedings of the English. It would be the frst time that England had ever stooped to do such a thing-that sbe had bowed down her neck and endured an .ffront, nay, paid those who insulted her, and thanked them. For that is the result of what these geutemen would have done. Jf you do not desire that, can you approve the conduct of the men who have placed us in that predicament ? They are placed in this81tuation, that they need have professed principles of conduct, not meanmg to carry them out, or else, following them to their consequences, they would have de'raded us among the nations of the earth. I knowyou wi5i all say "We will maintain the dignity, the pre-eminence, the honour of the country , and if you mean to do that, su,Dort those who are desirous of maintaininga Liberal linastrym power-a MinDitry who are pledged invariably to a course of conduct which embraces every social and political improvement, and pledged equally to the preservation from the least insult abroad of the honour and reputation of the kingdom. I should have been myself personally glad to be spared some of these topies; hbut I wili not bear to hear_a word of reproach against the honour and dignity
Of this Inngdom (cheers) ; and if there has beenx that reproach, then the result must lie at the door of those who introduced this unnecessary strain of observation, The Attorney-General referred to the poisonings at Hongkong, to the butcheries of Yeh, and- declared that Lord Palmerston would have been false to the horour of England if he had hesitated for a moment to support Sir J. BowTing, vigorously satirizing the plea of humanity and religion, which, if good for anything, would compel us to abandon Canton altogether. le could wish to have seen a more spedy progress in administrative and social reforms, but
th fault wa.s not in Lord Palmnerston, hut in the timid, hesitating men at his side or at his back, who sometimes voted for, and sometimes in opposition to, the Government. He caUed on the electors to return two members pledged to support a Government from whom they might expect measures tending in every way to the welfare of the people. (Cheers.)
A unanimous vote of confidence in both gentlemen was carried by acclamtion.
CARLISL.
Sir James Graham addressed a crowded meeting of his constituents at Carlisle on Monday evening. The right hon. baronet, after describing what had taken place at an interview with some gentlemen who had come to him upon the subject of his vote on Mr. Cobden's motion, referred to the course adopted by his colleague, Mr. Ferguson, and proceeded to say:- Now, with regard to a coalition, I state distincy, with reference to the motion brought forward by Mr. Cobden, he made that motion without consulting any person whatever, excepting Mr. Milner Gibson, who seconded it le laid that motion on the table of the Hous of Commion; in the words in which it wasmroved. He never c-onsented to alter one word,attheinstigationof any ne,to catch thlir votes. It was moved byhim as it was drawn by him - and upon hIs honour, given m the presenceof the assembled Comonos of England, he stated that motion was made by im without reference to any individual whatever. (Hear.l I go onto state toyou that until I aawthatmotion ulished
X t19u vtts f2 i :av outse of Commons1 fsenr ied tihe
Chinese papers I gave my attention to-those papers. I read them deliberately and carefullY s a matter of evidence I decided on those facts, 'without any motive whatever except to do justioe in the cae. Well now, what is this about sup planting a Government with a view of getting their places?' You bave not forgotten my history so entirely since last I appeared before you. From asens8of duty Isurrendered in the Government of Lord Palmerston,-one of the highest offices to which I could aspire. What base motive can be imputed to me with honour or justice? But Iwill tell you what is the observation of Bejamin Franklin, and I apply it to this cry of coalition, of compact, and unworthy mnotives. He ssas, " No accusation is so easily made or so readily believed by knaves as knavery." And when men make accuqations of this kind, it proceeds from the corrapt sources of their own imagination; and thus they impute to otbers what, in similar circnmstances, they would be ready to do themselves. I say, away with this trumpery accusation of coalition and combination. You have but to loolc at the list and see from how many qcuarters the votes of the -majority were given, to dissipate this vulgar charge of coalitioriand combination. (Hear.) Ido not,eekto remove Lord Palmerston. I have my opinion he is not the right champion of the Liberal cause. I differ from him widely on his
rinciples and many parts of his past conduct. (Hear.) r,ut {his ray, if in the new Parliament, the constitnecnies of England deiberately return a majority prepared to uphold bim in power, I shall be moet happy, if I am honoured with a seat, to support every liberal measure brought forward by Lord Palmerston's Administration with as much zeal and energy as if I approved his past conduct. Well now let us come to the question which has led to the dioution of the present Parliament. This is not the firstwar we have had with China, or for which Lord Pallerston iseuliarly responsible. (Hear, hear.) When the Duke of &toi bn and Sir R. Peel succeeded to power in 184Lthey found the country involved in a Chinese war,in which Lord Palmerston had taken an active part in involving the country. He then, as now, brought on a Chinese war, but was net so fortunati as to bring it to a elo. It was left to the * Duke of Wellington, with Sir PRobert Peel, to close that war, which Lord Palmerston had commenced. The question of right to eater into Canton arises under a treaty formed by Sir H. Pottinger in 1843. The Chines undertook to give an entry to the British-and, indeed, to all foreigners-into five of their cities, of which Canton is one. The inhabitants of Canton are peculiarly jealous of and hostile to the interference of foreigners. Varions Governors of Hongkong from time to time warned the British Government of the difficulty of enforcing this arrangement at Canton. The question was referred home-referred to Lord Palmerston. Sir George Bonham, then Governor of Hongkong, represented to the Government that the treaty ws not observed, and consulted whether force should be used. Lord Palmerston most wisely asked Sir George whether he thought the infraction of-the treaty was so detrimental to British interests, political or commercial, that it ought to be enforced by violence? Sir George Bonhana's answer was, hedid not think so. Earl Grey, then Secretary of State, and the colleague of Lord Palmerston, with the full concurrence of Lord Palmerston, gave instructions that no attempt to force an entrance into Canton should be made withoutspecial instructions from home. This order was repeated by vsrious Secretaries of State. Those instructions were given by Earl Grey for Lord J. RusselL repeated by the Earl of Malmesbury for Lord Derby, repeated by Lord Clarendon for Lord Aberdeen. By seven or eight consecutive Secretariesof State instructions were giventhat the treaty was not to beenforced. Yet upon this tiumpery affair of the Arrow, Sir J. Bowyin
takes It upon himself to enforce it by measures of such cruel violence that I blush to recollect or state them to you. (Cheers and interruption.1 I have read to you the words of Mr. Cobden's motion. I do not think more temperate words, more well-weighed and carefully considered words in reference to transactions in my opinion so flazrant, could have been employed. Now, how is this met by Her Majesty's Government? This is a most important part of the case. Here binges the appeal to the country, and the dissolution which is intended. There is not in these words a single syllable of censure, and it was open to Her Majesty's Government to have declared in their despatch Fent out to Canton that they regretted extremnely the course which bad been adopted, and which had led to such an effusion of blood; they had no doubt their officers had acted in difficult circumstances to the best of their judgment; that they regretted the past; andthat steps should be taken immediately to improve our relation with China, and to take precaution to prevent the recurrence of such evils for the future. Well, now as to the gneshon of coalition with Lord Derby With your permission
will touch now on this point, and will make a statement which is worthy of your attention. I have already referred to an occasion on which Mr. Ferguson and I happily agreed in opinion with reference to an extension of the county franchise. This motion was defeated by a majority of only 13. How was that majority composed ? It was composed of the whole body of the Derby party, and there were added to it Lord Palmerston and 17 members of his Administration holding office under him. If Lord Palmerston and the 17 members of his Goverusment had not been jpresent, or had not voted on that occasion, Mr. Locke Kfng's motion would have been carried, Reformers would have been triumphant, and your members, united happily on that occasion, would also have been triumphant. Who, then, defeated reform on that occasion? Who is the personr? (Cries of " Lord Palmerston.") Is that the first time he has tried to defeat reform? (Cries of "No, no.") The right hon. baronet here read a statement to the effect that Lord Palmerston bad withdrawn from Lord Aberdeen's Cabinet rather than sanction a moderate measure of reform, and then said-I as a witness can say it is a most true representation. From what source do you think I draw it? Why,-from 27c Times newspper of December 18, 1853-that very newspaper which is so very aciively employed in wrntingu Lord Palmerston as the approved Dead of the Liberal party. It will be for the constituent body to determine who shaU be the candidates-whom they shal support, and what are the principles they shall promote. A pledge to give a vote of confidence in Lord Palmerston, not feeling that confidence, I canDot and willnot give. (Loud cheers.) I have told you I think this is a very unfair question to go to the country upon. It ought not to be made a question of confidence in men i it ought to be a question of measures (loud cries of
' heir, hear"), and the mode most certain of promoting the measures which the constituencies approve. I believe that your principles with reference to peace, with reference to economy, with reference to taxation, with reference to non-intervention in the affairs of other countries, except where the honour of England absolutely requires-I believe that on these questions your opinions are in unison with mine. (Hear.) I will be true to the old principles, of which the watchwords are peace, retrenchment, and reform. Those are the princinles which I advocate, and I care not who is the First Minister. I sball not support any Minister who is not disposed to give effect to those principles. (Loud cheers.)
A resolution was then proposed to the effect that the meeting having heard the explanation of Sir James Graham have full confidence in him, and request him to aain become a candidate for the representation of Carlisle. TeT. were few dissentients to the resolution, which was carried.
SALFORD.
Mr. Cobden has declined to become a candidate for this borough. The hon. gentleman was present at a meeting of his supporters in the Salford Mechanics'Institution on Tuesday evening, when about 500 persons attended, includ-
g Mr. W. Morris, fr. W. Leaf, Mr. S. Pope, and Mr. Storey. Mr. Alderman Harvey presided.
Mr. COBDEN, who met with a most enthusiastic reception said it had been to him a matter of very grest gratification and pride that a numerous body of the electors of Salford had ;ommunicated their wish that he should stand for that borough. But on his arrival in Manchester that day he was met by a deputation from Huddersfield. and it had appeared to him better, under all the circumstances, for the interests of the cause they had all at heart that he should take his chance at that place. He was not acting from ersonal motives in the matter, but on public grounds. At tuddersfield there was no one else in the field to represent the principles he professed, but in Salford a gentleman might be found whose principles were, he believed, identical with his (Mr. Cobden's) own, and whose long services to the public entitled him to the confidence and favour of his felow townsmen. (Applause.) Sir Elkanah Arsnitage had met him (Mr. Cobden) onxhis arrival, and tendered him every possible assistance to premote his return (applause); but he would recommend the electors of Salford to return that gentleman himself. It was true, Sir Elkanah protestedand declared he would not ccept the nomination, bet then they al declared that until they were nominated (muchlaughter), and-he (Mr. Cobden) would advise them not to take Sir Elkanah at his word in this matter (renewed laughter), though he would take his word in everything else. (Applause.) He would undertake to say that if ho shouldhave the good fortune tobe returned again,whichwas by nomeans certain, Sir Elkanah and himselfwould always befound votingin thesame lobby. (Applause.) seshoul9 have been happy to represent this important borough, with which he had always felt himself in some degree identified. (Cheers) But, on the other hand, he should be glad to retain his connexion with Yorkshire, where he hrd met with very great kindness for the last 10 years and upwards. (Hear.) He would alUade to one other point in conclusion. Salford had madean attempt lately to returnua gentlemen who should represent all Darties. hut thetas
was impossible; no man could please al political parties by hisvotes and speeches (cheers, and he would advise the electors to choose a man who, like Sir Elkanah Armitage, was committed, decidedly and openly, to a line of polities which could never be made to blend with those of the party opposed to him. (Efear, hear.) That would involve a contest, and nothing could be better. During the last 10 or 15 years they had had no political contest in Salford, and consequently they had almost ceased to be political (hear.
hear); but all men who wished to preserve their hberties and govern themselves must be political and stady politics (Applause.) During the contest more polities would be talked and more learnt about public matters than probably in any twelvemonth when there was no contest. That was all very good for old and young (cheers and laughter), for it waa training people in the right path. When he looked at this meeting he felt quite sure tat if he had been fling among them during the next fort-
night they would have fought a winning battle, or he was much mistaken (great cheering); but they would have as good a chance with their own knowni neighbour, and he sineetlY hoped shortly to hear that Sir Elkrnahi Armitage was member for Salford. (Renewedacheering).
A worldng man said he had understood Mr. Cobden to express a .doubt as to his return for Huddersfield, and he suggested that some elector should therefore move that Mr. C6bden be nominated for Salford.
Mr. COBDE=.-I am very much obliged, but I will take my chance at Huddersfield. I am not eaily beaten anywhere (cheers and laughter), and I have no doubt I shall ucceedt in getting a seat somewhere.
There being a general feeling of disappointment expressed y te meetg one ortwo speakers gave utterance to a igeringz hope that the matter was not irrevocably decided, buntdMr. 0Cden stated that his address to theelet,rs of
Hdeafeldd had already been sent off.;
Mr. COByEN, in the course of mubseqisent ezplaaations, sd he had declared very uneqaivocally at the last4llfction
that he should not stand for the West Ridn&g again, pr
vided the free.trade question was settled. It hadbeen alleged tb.at he twas driven away from that seatog acount
of his recent vote, but the best answer was that Lord Gode. ichb who now sucoeeded him, bad votcd for his motion. He-, hear.) If he had chosen to stand -agin for that xTdiipg he could have been returned, or, at l events, no other Lberal could have been returned against him. But it had been known for a long time that his successor would be Lord Goderich, the heir to very large propert in West Yorkshire, and a young nobleman who had shown a remarkable devotion to the cause of the people. (Hear, hear.) He (M1r. Cobden) had therefore been desirous of succeeding Lord Goderich at Huddersfield, because he had always wished to sit for a borough where only one member was returned. He did not like to sit where there were two members, because he wAs not goo at running in a onrricle. (Laughter.) At the same timie, he was bound to add that he had never had the least communication, direct or indirect, with any human being at Huddersfield with regard to his succeeding Lord Goderich. However, he had lately been-very unexpectedly to himself, he confessed-regarded as a sort of firobrand in the country amonz the Liberal party; and how it might fare with him, any mnore than with anybody else who voted with him, he could not telL At all events, any one who beat him at Hudderafield or at Salford should have a good hard battle to fight. (Cheers.) Mr. Cobden also explained that a telegraphic message from him, which had given rise to a misapprehension in Salford, had been sent on partial information, some of his letters not having reached him. (Hear, hear.)
After some further discussion, two resolutions were passed espressing regret that Mr. Cobden could not be nomuinated, ano declaring Sir E. Armitage to be a fit and proper person to represent the borough. There were about half-a-dozen dissentients.
An address was issued yesterday morning from SirE. Armitage tothe electors, in the course of which he say,s-
" If elected I shal soppozt every measure calculated to promete the rnoral, social, and political Improvement of tho people. A residence of nearly 40 years among you, and the knowledge I havo acquired of your loca affairs, will, I ventre to hope, enable me to apprecate your wishes, and lthfnuly repreeent your interests on all occasions when sequired In Parliament."
At a meeting of gent'emen favourable to the retarn of. Mr. Oliver Heywood, held on Tuesday. it was stated that nearly 600 signatures had been obtained to the requisition to that gentleman. Arrangements wvere made for an effec-
taal canvass, and great confidence w.as exressed that Mr. 3Ieywood would stand, if a sufEcient number of iniluentia names were obtained.
NORFOLK (EAST).
There was a large attendance at Yarmouth on Tuesday night of the fnends and upporters bf General Windham and Sir Edward Buxton, thoe Liberal candidates for the Eastern division of this county. The Nelson-room of the Star Hotel, where the meeting was arranged to take place, being too smaU to accommodate the great number anxious to n admission, an adjournment took plce to the Cornbl, in Regent-street.
Mr. R. Hammond, one of the magistrates of the borough, was called to the chair.
General W`n%iIAi6r, on presenting himself, was received with three times three hearty cheers. He observed that it was now 2.5 years since he first set foot in the town of Yarmouth. He was at that time a Refornmer, and he had ever since been an advocate of hberal notions and just reforms. He did not know how many of those present were voters for the county, and how many for the borough, and thereforo he thought it just as weU to teU them aU what they might expect if they elected the Liberal candidates. His own line of fehad been quite different from that of many others. He had been called upon for years to make men keep silence in fight. The Liberal candidates for the borough, on the contrary, had been constantly using their tongues, and he was happy to say thcyhad used them welL. He wished sincerely that the Liberal candidates in the borough might be returned, as they would give their support to Lord Palmerston, which was whst every Ieformer desired. His address informed them that he came forward as a supporter of Lord Palmerston, whose name, abilities, and career were vastly better known than his were. As regarded his own claims, they were aware it was not by virtue of any property he possessed, for he was not a rich man; neither was it by virtue of any splendid talents that he possessed, for if he had any they were hid under a bushel, and unknown to them. Hehadbeensolidted to comeforward sa candidate for East Norfolk solely because ho had done his duty towards them and towards the country in a hard-fought contest-much harder thau they would fight in Norfolk. That was one rea-qon, and another was that he had always borne a straightforward character for honesty of purpose among those who knew him. (Cheers.) He was an advocate for free trade, living among agriculturists in this county at a time when they were almost half-determined to tear him in pieces for doing so. He had been a Reformer ever since he was a boy, and that was now six-and-twenty years ago, and therefore if the county of Norfolk thoeuht proper to return him as one of its representatives in Parliament he should always be ready and willing to listen to and vote for any(rational measure of reform brought forward, and based upon the principle, not of bringing others d. vn to the common level, but of raising those that were below it up. (Cheers.) He was in favour of reform in the law, reform in the civil administration, reform in the church, and reform in Parliament. (Cheers.) But at the same time he wished nothing to be done rashly. (Cheers.) Theyallhadtheirhobbies, andhe also had a obby. That was his own profession. He was a soldier, and he did not pretend to know rso much about other matters as he did about the army ; but let it be remembered that the army contaiued some of the best blood in the kingdom, and he did not see why the man did not deserve the support of the electors in this or any other county who boldly came forward to advocate the interests of those who had been so long neglected, and who did so without attempting to put the country to any unreasonable expense. He did not wish to see England overburdened with soldiers. He did not want to see as they saw them on the continent to an unpleasant extent, the whole country being covered with uniforms; but he thought the army might be based upon the national force known as the miitia. If these two forces were properly put together we might have ample resources; we might have a fno force ready to turn out at any monment, and under any circumstances, to defend us against a foreign enemy, and to aid in any of those negotiations in which it might be necessary to suetain tbh Administration of the day. (Cheers.) It was all very well for people to consider that an army which stood 1,000 men upon paper, but an army upon paper was as nothing; it was necessary to have a large reserve which they could bring forward at any moment to supply the deficiencies and losses they might have. They might see what was the case before Sabastopol, where we lost one-half of our men, simply because the enemy chose to shoot them, and we had to call up the remaining half, not to do the work whicb tbeywould have done, buttodo exactly whatthey didunderthe circumstanri5 The nrmy before Sebastopol was badly backed because we had no reserves. It was like lighting the candle at both ends, so that it burnt out as fast again as it ought to do. (Cheers.) When he told them that when he got to Parliament that would be his great hobby he trosted he should also be able to transact the other business of the county - and if he only met with their kind support-if they woulad come forward, dropping all minor differences, and looking upon him as a moderate refonrer, and rot an advocate of extreme views on either side, he bad no doubt that Sir Edward Buxton and himself would become members for East Norfolk.

A meeting of the Conservatives was beld on Monday night, for the purpose of considering the propriety of bringing forward Mr. Arthur Edwiin Way, of Ashton Court, as a candidate in the Conservative interest, at which, after hearing a statement from Mr. E. White, late secretary of the Conservative Association, as to the utter hopelessness of contesting the reprsentation with the Liberals with any chance of saccess, CaDtain Dolphin, who a,ared as the friend of Mr. Way, announced that he shod dissuade that gentleman from coming forward. Notwithstanding this decision, however, an addre was issued yesterday by Mr. Way, in which he says,-
"The expiring Parliament has distinctly shown that the conntry cannot be governed by a coalitioa of parties, and I am oona
quentlv prepared to sapport Lord Palmerston, wbo, I feel rssured, has the interest. the welfare, and honour of this conntry at heart, sad is
the mnan b,t quaLiolId at present to crry on the astairs of the nation.,
Mr. Way is to give a further explanation of his political views at a Fthbhc meeting of the electors to be held at the Gaildhell this day (Thursday).
rWORCESTER.
A large meeting of the electors of this city was held yesterday (Wednesday) afternoon, when an address was delivered by Mr. Aldernan Sidney of London. He said he-elieved Lord Palmerston would be able in 'the next Parliamentto showas boldauduniteda front of supporters as any Prime Mlinister ever met Prliament with within the last 20 years. He should go to Parhianient as an upholder of the Government in power, but not as the slave of that Governmeont. He wrould support the ?tnister of the day in every measure having forits object the welfare of the kingdom,
on; would oppose any measure promoted by that Govern ment which, in his opinion, had a contrary tendency. Mr. Alderman Hale moved, and Mr. Kerr seconded, a resolution of approval of Mr. Sidney's principles, and Mr. Elgie, attorney, moved an amendment for sucpporting the present member. The original resolution was carried by a large majority. The addres. of Mr. Ricardo, the sitting member, is out today. He simply " adheres to the line of poHcy which first induced the electors to choose him as their representative."

Sir,-My attention has been directed to the report in The Times of the 12th inst. of the examination of Air. Esdaile, the governor of the Royal British Bank, at the Bankruptcy Court, on Wednesday last, in which reference is made to "x young lawyer named Walker" as having been em loyed to get up a limited liability company for the hank's WVelsh mines, by having more than one inquiry made as to whether A amn the person aUllded to. As I am ayoung lawvyer, and the idea th-.tI am the individual named might injure me, and as IknQw your proverbial sense of fair nla and justice, I shall feel obliged by youlr giving publicity to the fact that Iamn not the Mr. Walker referd to, and that 1 do not even k-no v that gentleman.

Wednesday Evening.
The English funds openecl with increased heaviness this morning, but the market subsequently assumed a better tone. Consols for moaey, which left off yesterday at 93 were first quoted 92i to 93. Some moderate purchases were then effected, aud a recovery took place to 93t to i for money, and 934 to i for the 8th of ApriL The heavy loans obtained yesterday appear to have fully satisfied the requirements of the dealers and speculators, and money in the Stock-Exchange to-day was obtainable with com. parative ease. India Stock closed at 221 to 223; Exchequer-bonds, 98 to {; India-bonds, 4s. discount to par; and Exchequer-bills, is. discount to 2s. premium.
A total of 25,0001. in gold was taken from the Bank to-day for transmission to the continent.
There was an increased business in foreign securities, and prices were well supported to the close. The operations in Mexican were numerous at a further advance, but the highest quotation was not mnaintained. The first bargains for the account were at 24, and there were then sales at 231. A recovery immediately took place, and the price advanced to 24g. Other fluctuations followed from 24i to 24i; and the latest quotation was 24, to i. Turkish was more extensively dealt in, the transactions in the Six per Cents. for money being at 971, and for the account 97 }, i, i, and 98. The Four per Cents. Guaranteed were purchased at 101. The other business comprised Peruvian Four-and-a-Hlalf per Cents., 77A; Portuguese Three per Cents., 45i; the Three per Cents., 1856, 43i; Russian Five per Cents., 107i; Sardinian Five per Cents., 91k; Spanish Three per Cents., for account, 414 9; the New Deferred, for account, 256 and i; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 98-.
The corn-market was very heavy this morning at the depressed rates of MIonday.
The final prices of the French Three per Cents. On the Paris Bourse this evening were 70f. 85c. for money and 71f. 15c. for the end of the month, showing no alteration.
The letters from Paris state the demand for money to be rather active. Owing to the late gold receipts from this side the exchange on London shows firmness. It was reported from Madrid that M. Sala3manca and the Spanish Cr&dit Mobilie- of Rothschild have taken up from M. Mires the last two instalments of his Spanish loan of 3,000,0001., allowing him lj per cent. profit.
At Hamburg there has been a slight reaction from the late rise in the discount-market, the rate being now 56 per cent.
The liquidation of the affairs of the London and Eastern Banking Corporation is in regular progress, and several of the depositors are understood to have withdrawn their funds to-day. Owing to the assistance which has been obtained, and which has prevented any direct stoppage of payment, the full details of the course of management which h'as compelled the undertaking suddenly to wind up, with the loss, as it is believed, of a very considerable portion of its capital, will probably not come before the public. That great laxity must have prevailed is to be inferred, however, from the fact of 6 per cent. dividends having been paid up to July last, when the condition of the bank was stated to be so prosperous as to render it expedient to establish two new branches, the meeting being also informed that the audited accounts, after allowing for the dividend, "the payment of all expenses, and writing off bad debts," showed a surplus of 10,3781. to be carried forward. Either this statement must have been deceptive, or the whole of such difficulties as have been experienced must have occurred in the subsequent interval. The total number of shareholders is 98, including 6 ladies and 17 native Indians, and some of them are persons of wealth and position. According to the last return issued by the bank a month back its liabilities and assets stood as follows:-

It will be interesting to learn what proportion the " credits" in the above assets bear to the more tangible securities, and also to whom and in what individual amounts they have been granted, and whether to directors or their connexions. Nearly two years back TVe Times called attention to a caution given by the East India House with regard to this bank to the effect that the Indian Government did not recognize its authority. The bank potested in reply that the step taken by the India
ouse was defamatory and damaging, and that as the bank held a charter from the Crown, the public required no further protection than was afforded by that charter and by "the wealth, position, and standing of its proprietary."
A meeting of the creditors of Messrs. Copland, Barnes, and Co., provision merchants, who failed on the 4th of March, was held to-day, Mr. Harker presiding, when the following statement was submitted by Mr. Pullein (of the firm of Harding and Pullein), the accountant:

It was explained that the assets show a divdend
of about 6a. 8d. in the pound, and that the losses have been occasioned by the rise in the prices of provisions, the firm having a contract with the Royal Mail Steampacket Company. The estimated distribution, it is thought, will be realized, since the company seem disposed to take the remaining stores, both at home and on the intercolonial stations, at a fair price. In answer to qluestions it was mentioned that the private estates show no surplus, and that the amount of capital originally introduced has not been traced, the house having been upwards of 30 years in business. After hearing further details from Mr. Nicol (of the firm of Messrs. Allen and
Nicol), Telative to the cessation of the contract, and the manner in which it had been carried out, several creditors proposed a liquidation by inspection, but it having been suggested that an investigation is essential before coming to a fnal determination, the annexed resolution was ultimately agreed to:-
"That hessrs. Earker, Strong, Sneling, Thomas Pinnick, Alexander A. Rattray, and Charles lhillips, be appointed a committee, three to be a quorum, to investigate the affairs of Messrs. Copland, Barnes, and Co., and report the same to a meeting of the creditors to be called for the purpose.'
At a meeting of the Alliance Bank at Paris, on Saturday, the report presented stated that the profits from the 7th of April last (the date of commencement) to the 31st of December had been 19,2151. Out of this it was agreed to pay a dividend of 11. per share, which is equivalent to a rate of 16 per cent. per annum, and to appropriate 1,7351. for the entire discharge of the preliminary expenses, leaving a surplus of 6,3311. to be carried forward.
At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day Mr. E. Esdaile, the Governor of the Royal British Bank, was further examined. An adjudication of bankruptcy was made this morning against the estate of G. C Fianghiadi Sons, Greek merchants.
It has been announced by the Attorney-General that in the next Parliament he intends to bring in a Bill for the punishment of banking delinquencies
and other analogous breaches of trust, and also a Bill to facilitate the winding-up of the Royal British Bank.
Advices have been received from Pernambuco to the 16th ult. The Tamar had arrived there on the previous day in 14 days from Lisbon. The quota-
tions for sugar were unaltered. Hides, 320 to 330;: exchange, 27}; freights, 42s. 6d. i
The following vessels are reported to-day from China:-The Launceston, with 520,3C01b. of tea and 1,609 bales of silk, and the Iady Elizabeth, with 511,6001b. of tea and 104 bales of silk.
The fo]lowing is from the solicitor of the European and Indian Junction Telegraph Company:-
"Sir,-Thedirectors of the European and Indian Junction Telegraph Company, having had their attention drawn to the letter of Mr. Lionel Gisborne, published in your columns, tho object of which is to disparage this undertaking, and to advocate a competing line tolIndia rid the Red Sea, have commissioned me to place you in possession of the following facts, which, I believe, not only satisfactorily e'nswer the comments made upon the position of this company, hut show that hlr. Gisborne is not observing good fai=thv.
"In the first place, all the capital in this company has been subscribed, the shares allotted, and the deposit upon them paid; and, although the directors, in their prospectus, state that no call will be made until the firman of the Sultan is obtained and the other arrangements alluded to (meaning the Governmentguarantee) are concluded, yet the paragraph in question obviously contemplated that the grant of the firman would have preceded, instead of which it has been anticipated by the Government arrangement, one of the terms of which is that the Governmment undertakes to use its influence in procuring the firman. In return for this assistance it requires, as a preliminary condition, that 20 per cent. on the capital shall be paid up, to which there is no reason to doubt that the shareholders will most cheerfully accede.
" Secondly, with regard to the propriety, or even right, of Mr. Gisborne to promote the undertaldng he is now advocating, I trouble you with the following facts:-
" Some time before the prospectus of this company was published Mr. Gisborne had failed in attracting pUblic sup. port to a line of telegraph from the Dardanelues to Alexandria, which, as holding a firman from the Porte, he had projected, with a view to its subsequent extension to India, 2id the Red Sea.
"Immediately on the appearance of the prospectus of the European and Indian JunctionTelc aph Company Mr Gisborne wrote MIr. Andrew, the chairman of the company, a letter, dated the 29th of July, 1856, of which the following is an extract :
' It is probable that the competing lines to India will prevent either of them being carried out by private enterprise, telegraph companies not being in favour with the public - and I would suggest that arrangements be made to bring the whole support upon one line. My opinions re. garding the Red Sea route are not changed, but, nevertheless, as the European and Indian Junction Company are so sanguine of success, I am prepared to place in their hands all the powers I hold from the Porte, on condition that they carry out the hne from the Dardanelles to Alexandria upon the basis of the prospectus of the Eastern Telegraph Company.'
"Iwill leave it to your readers and yourself to say whether the obvious iriference to be deduced from the above is not that Mr. Gisborne retires from competition with this company upon being relieved from his obligations to the Porte and obtaining the other terms sought by his letter.
" Upon such an understanding I, on behalf of parties interested in the lines intended to be connected with those of this company, concluded an agreement with Mr. Gisborne, under which my client has paid and secured to him a very
large sum of money for the purchase of the concession from I the Dardanelles to Alexandria.
"Such agreement (dated the 30th of January last) contains the following clause, introduced for the protection of the purchaser -
" ' That the said Lionel Gisborne will not assist in the projection or formation of any other line of telegraph from or to any portions of the Ottoman dominions in the Mediterranean, or from or to the province of Egy t.,
" RJnder the above it is contended that Mr. Gisborne has no legal right to do what he is now attempting.
"I am sorry to have to add that within two days of the signing of this agreement Mr. Gisborne had entered upon the course he is nowpursng-that of projecting, contrary to his letter, and m hre of his agreement, the very undertaking he has been paid for abandoning. He is seeking to turn to his own advantage the arrangement which he has induced others to enter into with a view to the benefit of this company, and to deprive the purchaser of the advantages for which he has paid, and, lastly, is doing his utmost to imperil the success of this great undertaking, in which the public is so much interested.
"I am, Sir, your obedient servant,

the European and Indian Junction Telegraph Company (Limited). "Gray's-inn, March 18."
With regard to the proposed tax on French jointetock companies the statement already given may be rendered more generally intelligible by the following pairticulars :-These undertakings pay at present a yearly tax of 5c. per 100f. nominal value of their shares and bonds. The tax is to be raised to 15c. per 100f., and the real value (taking an average of three years), instead of the nominal value of the shares, is to be taken as the basis of taxation. Thus, Northern Railway shares, worth 1,000f., will be taxed 10 times 15c., or if. 50c. a- year, nstead of four times 5c. on 400f., their nominal amount, or 20c. On the other hand, the increased tax on the bonds of the various railways will be partialy compensated by their being taken at the market price, which is generaly under the nominal amount, the latter being that at which they are hereafter to be paid off and in excess of the figure at which they were originally issued. If the railway shares paid 5 per cent. at the market price the tax would be equal to a 3 per cent, income-tax, for a tax of 15c. on 100f. capital producing 5f. a-year is 1Sc. on If. revenue, equal to 3f. on 100f. revenue; but, as most of the French railways pay more than 5 per cent. at the present prices, the tax is not quite equal to 3 per cent. It is heavier in amount, but not in proportion, on those sbares of greater value, whose excess of value is derived from an increased revenue, but it wil tell heavily on those the price of which is higher than the average compared to the returns, in consequence of any fature expectations, &c. On industrial undertakings whose returns yield a high rate compared to their market value the tax will be proportionably light, while on securities the certainty of which makes their returns low compared to the market price it will tell more heavily. It is understood that each railway company will have to pay the tax to the Government yearly in one sum for all the shares and bonds comprising the capital, and that the whole amount will go to the debit of the eneral accounts, bein', in fact, borme entirely by the shares, as the stipulated interest will, as at prssent with the lesser tax, be paid intact on the bonds. As it is proposed to devise some plan for imposing the tax on foreign securities negotiated in France, it might be urged that by the same rule foreign holders of French securities should be exonerated from its operation. The following calculation, showing the amount paid at present, and likely to be paid in future by the Paris and Lyons Railway, will serve as an example of the operation of the proposed tax:-
PRss-rST TAX, 5 COrEas IM 100 FRANCS NonM.AL VAL
2,000 shares at 560 francs .. .n .. . 66,25D 80,000 bondsat 1,000 francs .40,000 IC0,000 bonds at 5600 francs. 25,C00

80,000 bonds at l,000 hv.. .. .. .n 120c,OD 10D.000 bonds at 300 francs .. .. .. .. 45i00O
761,i50
The present tax thus amounts to about S0c. a-year per share, and the proposed tax to about 2f. 85c. a-year, showing a difference of about 2f. 36c. a-year. It would exceed 3 per cent. on the dividend paid heretofore, but with the largely increasing trafflc at present existing it does not pro-. bably represent so much as a tax of 3 per cent, on the present revenue (which of course may be takel,n
as the cause of the rise of the prnce to the figure at which it has here been calculated).
The large increase in the traffic returns, especially from the carriage of goods, on all the French railways, and more particularly on the Paris and Lyons, is a remarkable proof of increasing trade and resources, and explains the rise in these securities in the face of the present dearness of money and the imposition of the augmented tax, which, although levied on all joint-stock securities, has especially attracted notice 'with reference to the Fench railways.

Out of this the directors recommend the payment of a dividend on the ordinary stock at the rate of 2 per cent, per adnnm, leaving 6,0734, which, together with 2,623p set asioe in January, 1855, for contingencies, amounts to 8.6974. for the next account. The arrangement with the creditors of the company for the acceptance of preferential securities in satisfaction for their claim; together with a partial abate. maent in the rate of interest thereon for five years from the 15th of May, 1852, is about to expire. The recei ts, exclusive of tollage for the year endig the 31st of enonathy 1852, amounted to 120,6991, the expenses to 76,8311, and the net receipts to 43,88; and for the year endi ith 31st of January, 1857, the receipts, exclusive of tho amountedtol d8,723b,theexpensers tov 8,65,and the nt

The Best Men For China.
THE BEST AfENt FOR CHINA.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Now that the Government have made up their minds to send out troops to China, and are fully aware that they will arrive at a most unhealthy season, why on earth do they intend to send out regiments of young men instead of troops who have become acclimatized, and who have no great objection to go ?
Now, the Government have in England 7,000 Marines fit for service, who have served in every part of the world, and for whom they have not even barrack accommodation. Numbers of these men are anxious to go, on account of the money they ar able to save when afloat, and, as they have been accustomed to changes of climate, they do not affect their health. They are accustomed to live in ships, in whichthe troops of the line will very likely sicken, and from the nature of the service on which they are generally employed wouldbefound best adapted for the workrequired to be done in China. This corps has likewise 500 very efficientartillerymen ready for service, who, as well as their brethren of the infantry, are very anxious to be sent, and would prove invaluableto anJ commander-in-chief. Why, then, instead of 280 intry ana 25 artillery of the Royal farines, do they not send out 2,000 or 3,000 infantry and 500 artillery of this useful corps, and so " put the right men in the right plaeo r Plenty 'would still remain for the service of the fleet, if required.
I remain, Sir, your obedient servant,

The London Reformatory.
THE LONDON 12EFoR3rAToRy,
A. special publio meeting of this Reformatory was held yesterday at Willis's.rooms, King-street, St. James',, the president, the Earl of Shafttesbury, in the chair, supp?orte( by the Duke of Agyll, Lord R. Groavellor, X,- the Hon. Arthur Kiennuird, ILP., the Hon. F. Byng, IL Ernest Bunsen, Colonel St;ce, Goveracor of the Reformatory; Captain O'Brien, Lieutenant Ooode, R.N., Pevs. R. Malone, C. Haume, O. Hatch, 3!e5rs~.Fo
tescue, J. Carter Wood (treasuarerof the Beformatorr), J. Payne. P. W. S. Sheppard, and other gentlemen deeply interested in thsand snimlar institutions, The noble chair. man called the attention of the meeting to the treatment and disposal of the criminal popnlattion, compi-.red the difference between the juvenile and adult portions, and referred to the present condition of the London Reformatory and the good it had effected, after wvhich Mr. J. Carter Wood made a statement of the funds of the institution; 1,28. huf been expended previous to entering the present house, for fitting which properly for the reception of its inmates 9_7Z, mnore had been spent. The committee were 112h in debt and their assets were 1281. The amountof subscriptions was3001. They were without funds to pay their crrent expenses, anl to clear them from the encumbrances on the establishment.
Ir. J. iL Cabon, hon. secretary, then read a report er.
planatory of the objects and management of tho reformstory, an4 its results, which were as follow:-'174 ofits inmates bad emigrated, 130 more had been placed in situa. tions> and few cases of misconduct had occarredamong them. The institution had recently been remodelled, with new pro. bation rooms and workshop, and now accommodated bmt 80 inmates in'eaa oi, as last car, 100. Six of these having just completea their period of 12 months, were about to be sent out as emigrant.,' The Duke of Argyll then rose to move the first resolution, "That Christian sympathyfor the fallen and duty to eociety alike call on every one to aId in the great work of reforming our criminal population." HisGraceeommencedby sayingtbathelookednpon theLondon Reformatory as one of the most interesting and important institutions of itshind in the metropolis. At amomentofzsuh great political exdtement as the present there was some temptation for the public toforget, in watchingtbestrugglos that were going forward, questions upon which the fate of Government and parties really depended. There was no denying there h been of late a serious increase of crime. The moXning newspapers had, day after day, teed with reports of crinmes wieh had caused everybody toew the state of society with no little alarm. He thonght that the Government of which he was a member had been too hasty in passing, in 1853, the Act for substituting a different kindl of punishment for that of transportation. Jre hoped that attention would be given to that Act by the Parliament which -was about to be elected, though he believed that the system of transportation was one to which it was not in the power of either Government or Parliament to revert. The benefit derived from that old system was not that of sending a criminal from this oountry to the colonies, or keepin
him there during the period of his penal servitude, but of his release, at the end of his sentenoe, taking place far from his old haunts and his old associates, so that the whole advantage wV1s that yon could send criminals to such colonies as Australia. There was an end, therefore, to this benefit, when this result took place of almost all the great colonies absolutely and resolutely re. fusing to accept a criminal populaton, except West Austra. lia;andasslong as that small colony'Was wiUing to thke convicts, so long would the Government continue to send them thither. But so exasperated were the colonists of tho other dependenies that they bad passed lawss refusing to receive even convicts whEo had a free pardon; and, although these laws to be valid required to be confirraei by the ome Government, yet they remained in force two or three months, till intelligence could be received from Eng. land if they had been sanctioned or annulled. Tlis he stated merely to show the exasperation of the people of the great colonies, and, as long as that feeling existed, it would b impossible forthe Government to revert to the system. They might send oonvicts to a barren island, or they might confine them in a cage, but in neither c&e could they secure to them those benefits which they formerly enjoyod, for they bad no place to send them to after the expiratioa of their sentence. Now, of the various remedies for dealing with the convict after the expiration of his term, none within. the reach of the Government seemed to him so desirable as that of placing him in the hands of these voluntary associations, espciaaUy that presided over by his noble friend the chairman. Before the change of punishment took place in 1853, the average number of persons 7early Eentenced to transortation was 5,000; but of those imnsoned, 70,000 It w as that large portion of the population who were not sentenced to transportation with whom they had to deal, as wllU as those on whom the severer penalty was inflicted; and the best means of reforming them that he could seewas placing themin thesevoluntary institutions, which took care of the criminal, and put him in the way of gaining an honest livelihood. These who were desirous ot paying some attention to remedial measures of this description might read with profit the evidence given in the Houses of Lords and Commons. In those blue-booL-s they would tee reference made to the Soci6tes de Patronage eshtblished on the Continent, and encouraged especially in Bavaria, where a regular system of these "soci6tus was kept up,
institutions which took criminals by the hand and led them back to honesty. IHe appealed to the public in support of such institutions as best ada pted to deal with that most difficult subject-the reform of our criminal population. It seemed that the largest proportion of the adult criminals of this country were under 30 years of age; many utder 25; a great number between 17 and 20. When ha considered the youth of these persons, and the fact that the majority were reduced to crime not so much from innate badness of disposition as from pressing exigencies, and that many were of weak chs. racter and easily susceptible of external influenoes, he could not but see a great prospect of their being rodeemed and reclaimed under such favourable circumstances as were offered by these institutions, not the least of which was that, after the inmates had given a twelvemonths' proof of the sincenty of their intentions, they were sent froe to distant colo.
ies. He only trusted that the colonies would not refuse to receive them after they had passed through reformatories in England by exercising towards them the severe laws they ba passed against convicts. He attached importance to thes institutions; and as Government had very much assisted national education by aiding voluntary schools, so possibly it would ultimately assist these reformatories. The public, however, must begin the work, and he was confident that It would be better handled by them than by Govern. ments; for they would throw their whole heart into the work which was always better when so done, He commended the institution to the hearty suport of the public, which hehob it wonld receive. Lord Robert Grosvenor, M.P., seconded the resolution,which wacarried Two other resolutions were passed-" That the best period for the attempt is on the discharge of the criminal from gaol, when loss of character and consequent difficulty of procuring work tend so powerfully to drive him back to former habits ' moved by Mr. Joseph Payne, and seconded by the Rev.

ROw.N-TIc STORY.-A Bayonne newspaper has the following strange paragraph:-" A man, stitl m the flower of his age, and appearing to suffer from a severo wound, arrived in this town a few days ago by the steamer from Santander; he was accompanied by au old Malay servant, of a copper-coloured complexion. The appearanco of the two was very singular, and the master seemed a prey to extreme sadness. After a very short stay, they both went to a village in the environs, where the master is to be cured of a wound which he has received. It appears from a Spanish journal that this personage, who is a MiL R. de G-, of French descent, but born at Madras, recently fought a duel in the neighbourhood of Santander wtfi Sir Harry S-, an officer of the fleet of the East India Company, and that he klled his adversary on the spot, but was severelywounded himself. It appears also that at the time of the opium war against China he, being then also an officer in the East Indian fleet, was sus. pected of having engaged in the piracy he was ordered to repress, and was consequently iU regarded by his colleagues An offensive epithet having been applied to him he chxllenged the offender, and killed him. The brother of the adversary then called out 1IL de G-, but the brother also vas kIlled. M. de G- subsequently had some strange adventures, which led to repeated duels. Thus, counting the duel near Santander, IL de G- has killed not fewer tban four men. Having visited Mexico, X de -feU irL with the late Count Raousset de Boulbon, and that person strongly pressed him to take part in his expedition to conquer some of the provinces of Mexico, butherefusod. liz his book, Count do Boulbon gives a description of the perorn of IX. de G-, which is quite that of a hero of romanceand speaks with admiration of the bravery he displayed in, duels. He says also that as that gentleman always avoided takin%g of naval subjects, he had never been able to ascerain whether or not he had ever really been a pirate. It is said that the stranger, after being cured of his wound, in. tends to enter the Convent of the Chartreux at Grenoble."
ADuLTERATio OF Corrox iz LhsDLk.-We regret to learn that the adulteration of cotton is again being resorted to by up-country dealers. It would appear that con. tracts were made to supply Bombay houses with cotton two and three months ago; but in consequence of the great rise in the price of the commodity sellers find itdifficult to carry out the conditions of their premature sale. The manner in which the cotton is adulterated varies with the ingenuity ef its possessor. Some fill the centre of each bale of good cotto with a quantity of trash. Others, again, spread out each bale on the ground, allowing it to remain exposed all night to the dew, and before the sun is up it is all carefully repacked, each bale being increased in weight by several pounds of moisture. Some adopt a more simplO plan of slipping in with the cotton a fewv sticks or stones, or other rubbish that may iDcrease the weight, and diminish the real value of the bale. Such being the case, we would advise our local cotton dealers to be on the alert, as tho transmission to England of adulterated cotton bales would not only be discreditable to themselves, but ruinous to this particular branch of trade. The Chamber of Commerce should taLke the matter in hand, and the police should be requested to exerciso the utmost vigilance at the different bunders, for the purpose, if possible, of bringing a culprit to punishment. ODe severe example would have a salutary effect on the up-coantry adulterators, who are, we dare say, not aware of the severity of the sentence to which a conviction would subject them. In addition to having to pay a heavy fiu eac
offender 'would have also to undergo a long siiprisonment, and that, too, in the company of thieves and rogues of every deacription. If district dealers Were aware of this it strikes us they would hesitate before renderingthemslves liable to such a pnalty; and we quegtion ruh if Governmernt or the Chamber of Commerce could adopt a6 better plan than to promulgate the law in all the cotton marts of Western India. At present er havo been asured the adulteration of cotton is systematic, and, unless some prompt and powerful remedy is applied, the evil will be attended wvith serious results. Already much eonfidence has been destroyed among dealers, and the effect upon trade is becoming evident. We have no wish to excito unnecessaxy alarm, but an evil is more easily extirpated when nipped in the bud than if allowed to reach maturity. -Bombay Tcdrgraph and, Co-ricr.

MINISTERS' MONEY (IRELAND) BILL. In moving the second reading of this bill,
Mr. FAGAN said, that he was quite aware that even if read a second time it could not pass through any other stage, but aithough this was an expiring Parliament he was anxious to obtain the sanction of that House, and he hoped, also, that of Her M1ajesty's Government to the principle of his Bill. The abolition of this tax would give satisfaction throughout the length and breadth of Ireland, and, with the exception of the settlement of the tenantrght question, no more acceptable message of peace could be sent to the people of that country by the noble viscount at the bead of the Government. A strong feeling in favour of the noble viscount was growing up in Ireland, and 'he trusted that the noble lord wonld not reverse that feeling by refusing to do justice in regard to this matter. Great as might be the noble lord's majority in a future Par. liantent, there were many who would promise to support him who would be Derbyites in disguise, and he might still need the support of the Liberal Irish members. The hon. member appealed to his hon. friend the member for Edin' burgh (MAr. A . Black). not to press an amendment which he had put upon the paper, havisg for its object to include within this Bill a similar tax imposed in Edinburgh and MIootrose ; and concluded by moving that the Bill should be rend a second tunle.
MIr. BAG WELL, referring to something which occurred when this Bill was last before the House, said that it was true this tax was not a remnant of the penal laws, but it was much worse, it wvas a renewal of them. To show the irregularities in the incidence of the tax the hon. member stated that the sum raised from Clonmel, which was but a very smallto wn, was 2411. per annum; }ilkenny, which was a much larger place, paid only 3071. per annum; and Limerick, wbich was amore considerable town than both these put togtther, but 3101. per annum. He earnestly hoped that in the next Parliament the Government would themselves introduce a measure for the settlement of this question.
Mlr. MEAGHER said, that the provincial towns upon which this tax was levied returned ten members to ParliAment, and had an influence inthe counties, which returned, perhaps, ten more. The Government would find it worth their while to consider whether they should make friends or enewies of those 20 members.
Mr. HOMSMAN said that, although the second readine of this BiU on the present occasion could lead to no practica'! result, yet he was prepared to fulfil the pledge which he gave on the introduction of the measure, that when it came on for a second reading he would state what were the intentiors of the Government with regard to this subject. Everybody who had attended to the discussions in Parliament durine the last 20 years must admit that it was a most difficuft question to deal with. In 1847 a committee was appointed, of which the late Mr. Sheil was chairman wlsich inquired fully into this matter, and the inquiry before which showed not only how great wvas the discontent among those who had to pay this tax, but that the persons who were most aggrieved were the clergy to who;u the tax was paid. The committee made a report, in wlich it recommended that the tax should be abolished, and that the payment of the clergy of the established church should in future fall upon the funds of the Ecclesiasti3al Cornmission. That recommendation had no effect, and subsequently an Act was passed by that House, known as " Sir John Young's Act," which it was hoped would have settled the question. By that Act the tenants of houses the rent of which was less than 104 were exempted fr<m the payment of the tax, taxpayers were allowed to redeeni the tax for 14 years' purchase, the clergy were to be paid in the first instance out of the funds of the Ecclesiastical Commission, suffering a loss of 25 per cent, on their non,,ual income, and the collection of the tax was taken out of thtir hands, and thrown, not happily in that respect upoin the town-cor.ncils and corrations of borouehs If the corporations collected it, wel and good ;but if tfiey failed to do so, then it became a debt due to the Crown and liable to be enforced in a court of law. Such were the provisions of an Act which it was hoped at the time would settle this much-vexed question; bat it was unhappily notorious that the measure had failed to accomplish any one of its obiects. (Hear, hear.) The relief given to housEs under 101. rent was only nominal, because the odium attaching to the levying of the tax from the poorer ratepayers had previously induced the clergy practicaUy to exenmpt that class; while the option of commuting the tax to 14 years' purchase had not been taken advantage of to any appreciable extent. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners had, indeed, paid the incomes of the clergy, but the corporatins which were bound to reimbursethen had never dcnc so. A deputation from the corporations of the seven towns which had to pay the tax waited upon him during the reckss, and firealy but temperately told him that they were unanimously resolved not to collect a shilling of it ; that they declined to submit to the double infliction of paying an odious tax individually, and also of having to compel their Roman Catholic neighbours to pay it. Legal proceedings were taken by the Government against the Corporation of Cork, and a decisiou was, after great delay, obtained in F3ebruary last against the defendants for the sum of 3,(001. then due. After the delivery of the judgment actions were entered against the other recusant corporations; but the Corporation of Cork appealed to a higher court in Ireland, and also to the House of Lords; and it was3not unlikely that two years wvould elapse before a definitive result wou3ld bo gained. Four years' arrears of thetax would bythat time be due, and the Government would have to take steps to comtpel each of the corporations to make their payments. Socon of the corporations possessed no public property, so that they would have to proceed against individual memo,bers of those bodies, who frankly told them that their persons w ere at the diswyosal of their prosecutors, and that, rther th an pay, they would suffer any degree of martyrdom. This was a state of things which the House had declared ought not to be prolonged, and, after much reflection on the subject during the recess, the Government had come to see their way pretty clearly as to the proper line to pursue. Various methods of dealing with the question had been sungested. One was that the Government ought to underta-e the collection of the tax in place of the corporations. That, however, would only leave matters as they stood before the passing of Sir J. Young's Act, when the Govermment only avoided defeat on this question by bring. iDg in a Bill of their ownu, of which they carried the introduction by a bare majority of 15. Another ,plan was that ;the tax should not be treated as an ecclesiastcal impost, but should be diverted to purposes of benevolence in which the members of ral religious persuasions sympathized-the support of public hospitals for example, towards which the wealthier class of the ratepayers, at all events, who had no title to exemption from this tax, should be made to contribute. But a proposal of that kind was made some Years ago by Sir J. Young to the heads of the established church in Ireland, wpho then objected toit; and, as it could not be carried into effect without the concurrence of all parties, it obviously had little chance of success. A further plan that bad been mooted was that of enabling the corporations to redeem the
tax at a lower rate than at present, say at ten years' parchase, and then making advances to them out of the con-
solidated' und for this purpose. These advances, however,
would, of "urse, have to be repaid; which, so far from diminishing the borden and mitigatingthe opposition it pr - yoked, would have the effect of increasing both. All t9ese
propositions had in turn been examined by the Government, and each was found to be of such a nature as held out nO hope of its receiving the assent of Parliament, The Bill ow before the House, on the otherhand, would totally abolish the tax, in accordance with the report of the select committee. That committee reported that there was no sevw principle involved in throwing the payment of the clergy on the fund of the Ecclesiastical Commission. The
3d and 4th of WiMam IV., chap. 37, contained this provriion:-
" And be it further enacted that in all parishes and places where in virtue of any law, statte, or custom, provision may heretofore have been made, by vestry or other assess
ment, for the maintenance of any curate, lecturer, clerk, or other minister or assistant in the celebration of divine worship, such provision or assessment shall from and after the passing of this Act wholly cease and determine; and it shalt and may be lawfal for the said commissioners under this Act, by and out of the proceeds of the said annual tax, and the other funds as aforesaid by this Act vested in them, to provide for all such purposes in such manner and proportions as to them shall seem fitting."
Thus, in other parts of Ireland, where under a special Act of Parliament t e clergy had been paid by such assessments, the Church Temporalities Act abolished those assessments and threw the payment of the clergy on the Ecclesiastical Commission. The select committee e- pressed its conviction that the funds of the commission would so far increase as to leave a margin out of which these payments could be made. That prediction had been fuly justified by the event. A return of the receipts and expenditure of the commissioners showed that between the years 1848 and 1856 their income had risen from 98,0001. to 140,0001. Between 1834 and 1856, after meeting all their various disbursements, they had in every year a large balance at the Bank, amounting at one time to 65,000., and at another to as much as 78,0001. In 1855 they invested 17,3071., and in 1856 12,8531. Therefore, even after paying the sum required for ministers' money, they hadalarge surplus left. On the 13th of February last the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland wrote a letter to the Archbishop of Dublin, to be laid before theIrish EcclesiasticalCommission, indicating the opinion of the Government that steps might be taken to render the property of the commissioners still more productive by improved management. In this letter his excellency stated:-
" The Government are inclined to think that they might have recourse to the method which has been twice adopted with great advantage in respect to the parallel Ecclesiastical Commission in England, by instituting an inquiry before a committee of the House of Commons, with a view to consider whether any more economical or profitable system of operations could be effected. Of course it would be most agreeable to Her Majesty's Ministers if they could carry with them the concurrence of the commissioners themselves in this design. Permit me to addthat, a a discussion in the House may be expected almost immediately, it would be an additional favour that any answer to this letter should be given with the least possible delay."
This letter was acknowledged by the Archbishop of DubliUn on the 18th of February, who promised that a special board should he summoned to take it into immediate consideration. This was the position in which the question stood when Parliament met and the hon. gentleman s Bill was introduced; and it was now incumbent on him to state the opinions of the Government. Considering that as the payment was now practically made by the Ecclesiastical Commission, to render it legally so would entail no new burden - considering the difficulty which had been so long experienced in collecting the tax, and which had not been obviated by their previous imperfect legislation; considering, also, that the attempt to enforce it by litigation was still more futile, the Government had come to the conclusion that no adequate remedy could be found except that suggested by the committee of 1847, and the spirit of which was embodied in the Bill of his hon friend (Mr. Fagan), the leader of that committee. (Hear, hear.) In a choice of difficulties there was one course which of all others it was the most discreditable for a Government to pursue,-viz., to continue a vexatious contest for a principle which it baffled all their attempts to enforce, and which, if persisted in, was only fraught with future animosity and strife. In his view, not the least recommendation of the course they were about to take was that it was a conciliatory as well as a politic one, and he earnestly hoped that the result would be to restore to communities in which contention and heart-burning had hitherto been rife that peace and harmony which all must feel it was the first duty of a Government to maintain. (Hear, hear.)
MIr. G. A. HAMILTON, while deprecating the discussion of such a question in an expiring Parliament, where their remarks might bear the character of being addressed to their constituents rather than to that House, could not, nevertheless, allow the speech of tho righthon. gentleman to pass wholly unnoticed. No fault was to be found with the right hon. gentleman for making his statement on that occasion; but of a?l the plans proposed for dealing with this subject the alternative adopted by the right hon. gentleman was the umost objectionable. The right hon. gentleman had omitted to tel the House that although the committe over which the late Mr. Sheil presided recommended the abolition of Ministers' Money, the resolution to that effect was only carried by the chairman's castin" vote. His main objection, however, to the measure shadowed out by the rigt honn gentleman was that it gave to the owners of houses in these towns an advantage to which they had no right. They had acquired their property subject to this charge, and it was unjust to divert ecclesiastical funds that were applicable to other purposes to the maintenance of certain clergymen who ad long had a provision secured to them by law, and which was ratified in a modified form by the Act of 1854. The right hon. gentleman had quoted a clause of the Church Temporalities Act as a precedent for this proposition, but it should be remembered that that Act was a compromise from which Ministers' Money was speciaUy excepted and it could not now be done away with without the violation of a settlement partaking of the nature of a compact. He mnust, therefore, enter his protest both against the plan of the Covernment and the measure now before the House, which were substantially the same in principle; and h begged to move that the bill be read a second time that
Captain JONES, in secondin- the amendment, observed that if the Chief Secretary for Ireland had read the report of the committee in an impartial spirit he would have seen that the fands of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were insufficient for the objects for which they were originally designed. The large balance which they had in hand was absolutely necessary to meet frequently recurring contingencies. In 1839, for example, when a violent storm caused extensive damage to a great number of churches in Ireland, these edifices could not have been repaired if the commissioners had not bad an ample surplus at their com-
Mr. MAGUIRE believed that the announcement of the right hon. gentleman would he regarded as a message of peace when it reached Ireland. At the same time, the Government did not realy deserve much credit for the decision at which they had arrived. They had not given way until they were fairly driven to the wall and obliged to suirrender. The right hon. gentleman had aleged manyexcuses for the course which the Government were about to adopt, although one was quite sufficient. The fact was they c(uld not collect this obnoxious tax, because every corporation in Ireland was deternnined to exhaust every possible means of escaping its payment. Nevertheless, the Government had done the right thing and done it well, and with a good grace (a laugh), inlead of tinkering and peddling with the question, At the close of that Parliament he took the liberty to say that he and the friends with whom he acted had never given a factious vote, or been deterred from deciding according to the strict merits of every motion, irrespective of its effect upon any political party. They ha4 voted Lord Derby out of office and Lord Aberdeen into it in 1853. They had displaced the Aberdeen Cabinet on the motion for an inquiry into the Crimean disasters, and he askedl was that a factious vote? They had also voted Lord Palmerston into office, and would be ready to vote him out again to-morrow (a laugh) if they were convinced that he was in the wrong. they would degrade their high position and compromise t?eir personal honour if they voted black white and white black at the beck of any party. He bad voted the other night with the hon. member for the West Riding and the right hon. member for the University of Oxford for no other r.ason than that they could not conscientiously say that the c' nduct of our representatives in Chinapwas consistent with the greatness of this country or with the religion which it professed; and if it were his good fortune to return to that Eiouse after the dissolution he should be animated by the same principles and the same sense of duty. He and his friends were independent of party, and cared neither for office nor for the blandishments of those who enjoyed it. They were ready to support the Government when it was in the right, and to crush it when in the wrong, no matter what might be the consequencee either to themselves or to others.
Mr. BLACK said he had intended to propose an addition to the Bill, the effect of which would have been to repeal the annuity-tax at present paid by the inhabitants of Edinbu-g-h and Montrose, hut under the circumstance he should not persevere with it. He denied that the tax fell on the landlords, and not on the tenants. But even if that were so the irritation and annoyance to the tenants, who had to pay thoemaoney out of their own pockets when the tax gatherer called for it, wvere just as great.
Sir D. NORREYS, referring to the observations of the hon. member for Dungarvan, denied that all the independent Irish memnbers sat on the Opposition side of the lfonse. He was himself as independent as the hon. gentlen,an or any of his friends; he, like the hon. gentleman, had voted against Lord Derby's Government and against Lord Aberdeen's Government, and he should be ready to vote against the present Government when it failed to bring forward such measures as he thought the interests of the country required.
Mr. BEAMISH congratulated his hon. friend the member for Cork on the success which he had gained, and he thought the tlanks of the country were due to the Government for the manner in which they had dealt with this question.
Mr. COWATN said the existence of the annuity-tax was a great source of irritation and discomfort to the inhabit. ants of the two towns subjectedtoit, and he hoped that it would be put an end to at the earliest possible opportunity.
Lord PALMERSTON thought it would be more convenient if the discussion were confined to the subject before the House. The Ministers' Money Bill was an Irish matter :md, with all due deference to the hon. gentleman who had just sat down, and those who had taken a similar course it was not quite regular to diverge from it into a Scotch question. (Hear, hear.) What his right hon. friend the Secretary for Ireland had stated was that the Government were prepared to accede to a motion with regard to the ministers' money in Ireland, but the annuity-tax, in one respect at least, was an entirely different question. The ministers' money could beprovided out of tho resources of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and its abolition would,
in point of fast, make no kind of difference, because at prosent the amount was advanced by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and they found considerable difficulty in getting the money returned by the corporations. The annuity-tax in Scotland was an entirely different thing, and be hoped that it would not be thought that the Government had given any pledge with regard to it. (Hear.) It must be dealt with on its own merits, and not involved in any debate on a subject which had no connexion with it. Under these circumstances he hoped the discussion would be confined to the Bill before the House.
Mr. KINNAIRDl said the co-operation of Scotch membars had been invited by those who had charge of this Bill, otherwise they would not have interfered in the discussion.
He hoped, however, the attention of the Government would be turned to the abolition of the annuity-tax.
Ir. HEARD expressed his gratification at the tatenient of the right hon. gentleman the Secretary for Ireland as to the course which the Government intended to pursue in this matter.
Mr. FAGAN was sorry that -any remarks of his should have been taken by his hon. friend the member for Waterford as being intended to reflect on the honesty of his hon. friend's motives for the political course which he had lately pursued. Certainly, when he had heard Lord Derby describe the church to which he belonged as being "reli iously corrupt and politically dangerous" it had annoyed him to think that hon. members professing the same faith as himself should be giving a general supp..rt to that noble lord's party. With regard to the course vhich the Government intended to take upon this Bill, he was convinced that it would be received as a message of peace in Ireland, and would give general satisfaction, not only to those who were affected by the tax, but throughout the country, because a great religious principle was involved in it.
Mr. HENLEY bad not expected that there would be any disussion on this Bill, and he thought his surprise at what had taken place would be shared by most members. He could not exactly see the use of the statement which had been made by the Government, as far as the House was concerned. It might be very convenient for the Government to make such a statement on the eve of a dissolution, looking to the effect to be produced out of doors, but it was clear that the present Parliament could do nothing in the matter. It was a mere expression of an opinion to which no effect could be given.
Sir G. GREY said his right hon. friend's statement had been made in fulfilment of a pledge given previously by him that he would explain what course the Government intended to pursue when the BiU came on for a second reading.
lk. HotESMIAN added that the correspondence which he had read contained a similar pledge on his part.
The Bill was read a second time and ordered to be com. mitted that day three months.

TELEGRAPHIC COMMIUNICATION WITH INDIA. In answer to Sir D. NoRBrys.
Mr. WILSON said that the only line of telegraphic comnmunication between India and Europe with regard to which the Government had at present entered into any engagements was the line going from Seleucia to Eornah, on the Persian Gulf. The company would have two years granted to them for making their arrangements, and, of course, in the meantime the Government would not entertain any other project.
In reply to Mr. OTWAY,
Mr. WILSON said the only assistance to be given to the company would be in the way of payment for work done when the line was completed. An application was before the Treasury for assistance to a company proposing to establish a line of railway, but no definite resolution had been come to on the subject.
THE WALLACHIAN REFUGEES.
Mr. OTWAY asked if the good offices of the Government had been employed to obtain the restoration to their country of the 20 or 30 Wallachian refugees who alone of all those who had been originally exiled from Wallachia had not yet been alowed to return.
Lord PALMERSTON said he was aware that the persons referred to by his hon. friend were gentlemen of the tghest respeotability and entitled to consideration. The affairs of the provinces were now in a train of settlement. The Austrian troops had begun the evacuation and would very soon be entirely out of the provinces, and the Divans were about to assemble for the purpose of taking into consideration the arrangements best u for the future welfare of the country. Se had not the slightest doubt that these gentlemen would be allowed to return to their homes, and the British Government, so far as they could have any influence on the subject, would certainly be most anxious that that permission should be accorded to them. They were persons well entitled to be allowed to return to their country, and he had not the least doubt that their return was more a matter of time than anything else.
The House adjourned at half-past 2 o'clock until Saturday.
The Expedition To China.
THE EXPEDITION TO CHINA.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Whatever may be the issue of the operations against the Ohinese, whether there is war of some continuance, or a peace speedily obtained on terms to be solemnly ratified on both sides, I think there can be no doubt but that the forces we send to the scene of action will be kept on the spot for some tine. We have been told that large ships are sent, as, from the nature of the contemplated operations, and also from the nature of the climate, they Will act not merely as transports but as barracks.
It may have already struck the authorities-it has pressed itself deeply on mv own mind-that with the expedition one or two large hospital vessels should be sent. It is my firm conviction that, certainly for many fevers, and very generally for wounds, better ventilation and better accommodation for the patients can be obtained in a ship properly fitted than by the use of any old barracks, stores, or suchlke baildings that chance may afford ashore.
I believe that in a very short space of time two such large vessels might be thoroughly fitted and provisioned with stores of medical comforts, with all of medical appliance which would be needed. But I am also firmly convinced that the entire of such fitting and provisioning should be done under the immediate eye and diriction of the medical staff to be appointed to these floating hospitals. I should be sorry to hear-though it would be no matter of astonishment-that old medical stores, &c., the remnant of the Crimean business, were to be reexported for Chinese iue. If the Government would escape the chance of a second exposure of our failure to find for the sick and wounded of our armies the care, skill, aud shelter they deserve, they must defy "routine" and try common sense.
There are plenty of most able men, with experience dearly bought in the East, among the medical staffof the army. Let them be offered the pay their experience has a right to demand; give them the means of ascertaining before they leave these shores that they have with them everything that science can suggest to meet the fevers of the climate as well as the wounds received in action; give them these floating hospitals, found in all they can suggest, with a staff of orderlies fit for hospital duties; and we shall at least have the satisfaction of knowing that the Executive could do no more.
As to the expense, John Bull won't grudge it. It 3right be saved in one year from some of the wanton invasions on good taste and common sense on which we spend tens of thousands every year.

Warning To Photographic Artists.-Our
WARNsG TO PHOTOGGA..mo ARTiss.-Our photographic friends wil do weU to take warning from the following extract taken from a Cape paper, in which it is stated that Dr. Atherstone, an eminent photographer, had nearly poisoned himself :-" It appears that in removing the starns of nitrate of silver from his hands with that deadly poison cyanide of potassium (the plan commonly adopted by photographers) e suddenly felt a glow through his whole frame, accompanied by a tremulous feeling. The thought instantly flashed across his mind that some of the poison had been absorbed by some scratches or cuts on is hands which he had forgotten. He washedl his hands instantly, taking ammonia and wine. But the symptoms increased; his sight grew Indistinct, his memory was impaired ; and a sense of fainting warned hin that a poisonous dose had been absorbed. He then tried cold affusion, with temporary relief; and a powerful showerbath gave great relief for a time, but the symptoms returned it intervals of a few mninutes; the jaws felt constricted, and there was a spasmedic action of the muscles of the arms, parched throat, the sense of faintness In three hours these symptoms left, andhefell asleep. The next day he suffered from great exhaustion. This case shows the necessity of extreme caution on the part of photographers and others in the use of this highly poisonous salt. The following wiU be found a safo and equally efficacious mode of removing the stains of nitrate of slver from the hands :-Moisten the stain with a sata. rated solution of iodide of potassium in water, and afterwards with nitric acid, diluted with two parts of water, then wash in a solution of hyposuiphite of voda.-Madrms Se4aCor, Feb. 2.
The Double Murder At Walworth.
THE DOUBL MURDEBR AT WALWOGRT.
Yesterday Tk,omas Fuller Bacon, and Martha Bacon, his wife, who have been in custody for several weeks, chargd with the deliberate and shocking murder of Edwin Fuller Bscon, *ged 2. years, and Sarah Ann Bacon, agedlnonths, were brought up from Horsemonger-lane Gaol to Lambeth Policecourt, for final examination before Mr. ELLIOTT, the iitting magistrate. Mr. Woodward, the solicitor, as on former occasions, attended on behalf of Bacon, and Mr. Crouch for his wife.
Long before the time appointed for the examination the court was l:terally crammed with well-dressed per. sons, all of whom evinced the greatest possible anxiety to catch a imppsc of the accused parties and to witness the proceedings.
The testimony of Mr. Harris, the medical officer at Horsemonger-lane Gaol, MIr Harriett Payne, aunt to the miale prLsoner, Mrns Muuroo, her daughter, William Henry Cook a police-constable, Dr. Bushel, Mrs. Oakes, the female se rcher at the cour, Thomas Horto, another police-constable, and Mrs. Mary Sergeants was read over by the Chief Clerk, and, in the evidence given by the last witness on the former examination, it was stated that on the vening of Sunday, the 28th of December, she (Mrs Sergeant) saw the prisoners leave their house (next door to hers), and at that time the male prisoner had a child in his anns. At this time the prsoners were going to the house of Mr. and Mrs. Payne at Mil-end, and it was stated in the evidence of Mrs. and Mr. Payne, as wells in that of Mrs Munroe that on reaching there they had not either of the childrenr with them. This discrepancy led the magistrate to ask MIrs. Sergeant if her recollection was quite clear on the point, and she replied that it was not, and that she might have been mistaken. Mrs. Langrage, the matron at Horse. monger-lane Gaol was called, and deposed to having observed a deep mark round the throat of the female prisoner, as if produced by a piece of cord tied tightly round it, and a thick piece of cord was found at the house where the murder was committed. It wil be also recollected that Mrs. Bacon has declared that her husband had attempted to strangle her by tying a cord or rope round her neck.
The evidence of Ann Hyde was of much importance. She said,-A week after the children were found dead I was called in by rs. Payne and requested to go toth r soners' house to sit up with those who were there. firs Payne, Mrs. Munroe, and the male prisoner Bacon were there. On the Wednesday following I did some washing, and washed six or seven shirts Mrs. Payne gave me. On one of the shirt flaps I saw a little blood, and mentioned it to Bacon, who said it was occasioned by his being affected by piles. I told him it was no such thing, as I had been a nurse at a hospital, and had some experience in such matters, and therefore was quite certain it could not have been produced by that disease. It was a smear, as if it had been rubbed by the hand, but had no marks of fingers. There was also a smll mark of blood on the right wristband. It was a small speck just at the edge of the wristband. I noticed that Bacon appeared dreadfully nervous and timid, and asked him what made him so, but he made no reply. He often talked about the death of his children, and said it was a very bad job. He said he hoped his wife would not get punished, but would get home to live with him again, as he was sure she did not do it; that somebody got into the house at the street door. I often said to him what a shocking thing it was, and that if there was anything wrong he should tell the truth. I said that, because I had my doubts, the prisoner at the time being so very timid. He told me that once a key was put into the front door, and on going to it there was no one there. I still had my doubts, and told him two or three times that he had better tell the truth. I told him I did not think his wife had done it, but never told him who I thought had done it. I said to him, " Your wife won't think of laying it to you, or anythinz of the sort," when hereplied " li she says anything Pl hll her." Mrs. Munroe and a httle girl were present when the prisoner used this exclamation, but Idon't know wbether they heard him or not. I recollect seeing a pair of fus tian or moleskin trousers upstairs in the front room, and saw a small spot of blood on the right leg at the bottom, hut said nothing to any one about it. I have seen the same trousers to-day, and there is no spot where I saw the blood. It looks as if it had been taken out. Bacon never told me how the blood came there, but said he had a sore finger, from cutting it while carving his dinner. Upon one occasion he was leaning on the mantelpiece,-I don't know whether asleep or not,but he made use of a word like this, "Good God! how was it I done it ?" These were the words. He spoke them in a firm voice to himself, and I said, " Done what, Mr. Bacon ?" He seemed confused, and did not make any reply but afterwards said what a very unhappy man he was, and that he did not know half his time what he was doing. I saw the small rope or cord produced on the edge of the dusthole on the day I was washing there. Mr. Bacon told me of the watch and sovereigus being stolen, and asked me to look among the hay and straw in the coal-cellar for them, particularly or the watch.
In cross-examination by Mr. Woodward the witness said, it was the third night she was in the house that the expressions she had mentioned were used by Bacon. She thought he had been sleeping, but could not say he had. Hs words, as near as she could say, were, " Good God i good God! how was it I done it ?" She said, " Done what, Mr. Bacon ?" He (Bacon) expressed himself very unhappy, and more so when he was asleep than when he was awake. He did not tell her the blood on his shirt was the result of accident caused by his wife.
The testimony of William Payne, an uncle by marrage of the male prisoner, was of importance. He said,-On the Sunday evening before the discovery of the murder of the children the prisoners came to my house at Mile-end, between the hours of S and 9 o'clock, but they did not stop long, but went off with my wife to see my daughter. I did not then notice the cut on his finger, but having seen an account of it in the newspapers I looked at and examined it, and told him I thought it had been done while sharpening a knife on a steel. I thought so by the cut. It was right across the left-hand forefinger, I think near the first joint. He said he did not cut it that way, but that he did it CUtting a bit of meat at dinner; that his knives were new ones, and did not require sharpening. I have talked to him a good deal about it, because he said he was sure his wife did not do it, and that he did not do it himself ; that he had every reason to believe that somebody had unlocked the door and gone in and done what has been done. I asked him if he had left the key in the door when he went out ? He said that he had hung it up, and that he had made a common practice of doing so. I told him I believed it lay between him and his wife; that no one could have gone inand done such a thing without taking the money that was tbere. He then said nothing to it or about the robbery, but in two or three days afterwards he told me he had been robbed of a greatco3t and other clothes. I asked him, what greatcoat, as I had never seen him with such a thing. He said it was a rough greatcoat. I asked him if his tailor had made it for him, observing that if he did the police wouid find it out, and then asked him, whether his tailor had made it or not? Bacon hesitated, and then said he had taken it for a debt. I asked him of whom, when he again hesitated, and could not tell me, and I considered it to be altogether false. Bacon also said he had lost a watch, but I had never heard of his having more than one watch, and that he had when he returned from Reigate, and that wAS the watch he described as lost, and that watch m Wfe had in her possession after he came from Reigate. The watch produced by Sergeant Broad, No. 32,798, is that wath, rbe lieve. never saw the other watch, 13,663, until after Bacon came backifrom Stamford, a week after the murders. When the prisoner came to my house on the Sunday night before the murders were discovered he seemed a good deal confused. His wife sat by me on that occasion, and in the course of conversation I said, " I wonder how you can leave those little children;" when .Mrs. Bacon, after a few moments, replied, " Uncle, you have no cali to fret about the children; they are happy " and that was all she said. On the Wednesday morning-the morning after the marder was discovered-on Bacon cominm to my house, he said he did not believe his wi7e knew anything about it. When he told me about his being robbed, I said it was all false, and, if they find the things, they will put you on your oath. He replied, "Hold your tongue;- rul not swear to any, nor will I speak." The last time I spoke to him I said, " Suppose your wife turns round to-morrowv and says you have done it?' He looked at me very hard, ,a,ndthen aiad "Mytw,i,fe never did deceive me yet." I said,
In cross-examination the witness statod that Bacon said nothing whatever of the robbery on the first time or two he saw him, nor until he (witness) said, " How could any one go in and murder your children and not rob the house? ' Theu it was that he said he had been robbed.
Three or four witnesses, who lived on either side of the house where the murder bad been committed, and who had been frequently annoyed by the cries of the murdered children, and particularly the youngest infant, were called, and neither had heard a single cry on the Sunday before the murders were committed; and, couplig this fact with the declaration of Mm Bacon to Mr. Pae, ? that he had no call to fret about the children, as theywere thapny, it would lead to the strong presumption that the slaugr of the unfortunate mfants took place on the Sunday,
Three of the men who had been employed with Bacon at Reiate on Monday the 29th, and Tuesday the 5oth of De. CmDwere called, and all spoke of the extraordinary state
oi mind wuien he appeared to be in on both these days-in such a state, in fact, as to be perfectly unable to do a bit of work, and the attention of all about him was drawn to the singularity of his manner and conduct There wasanotherincident of a suspicious character connected with his going to work at Reigate, and that was that on the drawers in his bedroom he had placed before starting an envelope addressed to him at that place in his own handwriting, and a sheet of blank note paper inside
The evidence of Inspector Young, of the L division of
police, to whose exertions and intellgence ssisted by Sergeant Broad, the public are indebted for pl gin a course or justce as wily and, it is feared, as monstrous an offender as any that has for some years been brought before a British tribunal, was read over and occupies a large spaco on the depositions. Mr. Young took up the case from the moment Bacon had intimated that a robbery as well as a murder had taken place at the house, and that a part of the property stolen was a 61 note which he (Bacon) had
received with three others in change for a 30L.
check, a greatcoat, and a suit of clothing. By considerable exertions the whole of the four notes were traced to have been changed by the prisoner before the murder, and three of them were paid into the Bank inthe7month of November. The officer also foumd that the prisoner never had such a coat as the one he said he had lost and, in fact, found that the alleged robbery never took pLac The prisoner, dreading thel conseqnences of his own grossly false representations, had actually gone down to Stam-
ford and endeavoured to persuade a respectable tailor there that he had made the greatcoat in question for him, or rather to say he did, but the tradesman, Mr. Dixon, told him plainly he had done no such thing, and not only refused to lend himself to so disreputable an act, but has come forward as a witness It will also be recollected that it was owing to the persoe
verng inquiries made by Mr. Inspector Young that the sale of arsenic at Stamford to Bacon ^, few days
before the supicious death of his mother has boon ds covered, and this of course led to the exhumation of the body of sr Bscon, and the verdict of " Wilful murde apinst her sou, the pretent prioner.
Mr. Astle, from the London and Westminster Bank, deaoed that on the 18th of November last he pavc cash for a
1c heckj n four 51.-notes and 10 eovereUgn3; and IIr Bey, orthe Bank of Englnd, prdced the foar notes, whCih had subsequently been paid into the Bank of Dug.
The Iastwitneas called was Cook the gaoler, who deposed that the statement prodaced, signed "Martha Bacon, WAs

"MAXTHA. BACON.,
Cook also said,-This statement a was made on tho 2lst of January, before the mE risoner was taken into cusdy, but after it had ben ra he was given in charge.
On cross-examination, the witness sad the prisoner, Mrg. Bacon, had asked him for a sheet of paper, and wrote the statemenLt at his desk- withiout any dfictation by any onet. He could not say whether Mrs Reill was present at the time, but Mrm. Payne and other female frinds of tho prisoner were. When the prisoner asked for the paper, he (Cook) told) all her friends to stand away, andhe could positively say that no person dictated the statement to her.
The reading of the confession of Mrs. Bacon caused some sensation among those in the court who had not heard it before, but nothing equal to that which it caused on the 21st of January. Bacon up to this point, though evidently with an effort, kept ul his spirits, and in fact, eemed to pay much more attention to the case than he haa done on any former examination, for he took down on paper, with pencil, the names of the different witnesses as they approached the table to have their evidence reid over. Oa the reading of his wife's statement his countenance underwent a total change, and he hung down his head to avoid the gaze of those in court He was r all recovering from this evident shock when'sr Woodward requested that the statement made by the prionerto In spector Young, on taking the charge, might appear on the face of the depositions, and this, s it will be seen, put Bacon's feelings to a stronger test.
JMr. Young said that after the reading of the statement of Mis. Bacon on the 21s of January her husband, the Iale prisoner, was taken into custody m the court and removed to the staionhouse to have the charge entered against him in the usual way. While the charge was in the course of being taken the prlsoner exclaimed-" Oh, lr. Young, is it not shoeking for her to say I did it? Oh, dear, that she should say I did it I I don't fear the Lord will help me through it! My poor boy, I could not hurt a hair of his dear little head I The truth will always go the furthest."
The prisoner, on the allusion being made to his boy, burst into a flood of tears, and, leaning forward so as to screen his face by the upper part of the dock, sobbed aloud. Having partially recovered, he raised his head, but still kept weeping.
Mr. ELLoTT asked Mr. Woodward if it was his wish to offer any remarks before the committal of his client, but he declined, saying that, as his worship, as he understood, had made up his mind to send the case before a jury, he should reserve psefenee.
The prisoners were then committed for trial.

CRIMEA.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TMES.
Sir,-AUow me a few lines of space to express the great pleasure I felt on perusing the spiited and courageous letter of Sir John Hall in The Timm, of to-day. I happened to be engaged at the Balaldava Hospital when Dr. Sutherland first arrived in the Crimea, and I remember his visit to the hospital. The rough, cold, bleak, and fatal winter had then passed over, and things in and out of hospital were assumig a more tolerable and settled aspect, considering the ec'uixna csition in which we were placed, and, as Sir John allhad
n using his utmost efforts to ameliorate the state of matters as far as the " routine system" would permit him. Dr. Sutherland had nothing to find fault 'with-nothing even' tosuggest iheyondwhathad been suggestedover and overagain if we had had means to carry out our common-sense suggestions. I believe that every other hospital in the Crimea was in the same improved condition when Dr. Sutherland made his first appearance
I trust, Sir, that truth and justice will not be violated, and that Sir John Hall 'wll be allowed to enjoy in peace the credit and honour which are so justly his due, ana his only.
I have great respect for Dr. Sutherland. He is very clever, and can write an excellent despateh, but it is absurd to overrate the valne of his labours in the Crimea, or yet compare them 'with those of Sir John Hall.

Sir,-I can bear the most ample testimony to the reasonable nature of the protest which Sir John HaU has put forward, on behalf of the medical officers of the Crimean army, against the preposterous assertion that the Sanitary Commissioners had the smallest share in bringing about the healthy and effective condition of the troops in 1855-6.
So far as the world knows of the results of the labours of these gentlemen, a more useless and unjustifiable ex, diture of public money never took place than in the formation and payment of those very Sanitary Commissioners.
They hunted out smells,wrote reports, sniffed about amon
atrines and slaughterhouses, jotted down bad odours, an. meddled without mending. But what practical good they did I, in common with many others, never know, and don't know even yet.
The fruits of their labours-if any-ought reaUy to be given to the world. At all events, let it be seen how far they are justied mn appropriating any of the credit due to the hard-vworked, laborious, much-censured, ill-requited Meodical Staff of the army.

Sir,-I have just returned from tho Nile, and am grieved at the state of rapid obliteration to which the hieroglyphic and pictorial records on the monuments are subject. To say nothing further of Lepsius and such licensed depredators (much of the fruit of whose spoliation is preserved in some or other of the public musenms) than that future ages wil look upon them as barbarians-there is a numerous and most muschievous class,-the daily visitors, so many of whom must take away something by way of record. E.y.- I saw the other day at the Great Templeat 1;arnac a person, whom I afterwards discovered to be a preacher from Now York, hammering away with a polo at the beautiful starspangled ceiling of tho sanctum, endeavonring to detach a
Iwhole star," as he said. I remonstrated, but in vain, for I afterwards saw him picking out a piece of the stone which bears the effigy and oval of the KEing of Judah, by which the victory of Shishak over Rehoboam is recorded.
Mrs. Romer, in a book published a few years sinco, in speaking of one of the tombs at Thebes, on the wails of which, among other paintings, are the brickmakers, with their taskmasters standing over them, says that her drago-
ran, Lohammed, " cleverly detached two pieces of the wall for me, each fragment containing a painted head, evidently that of a Jewish captive." Now these fragments, of the highest interest and greatest value in their proper pl
are worth but little when detached, and are probably in most instances destined to find their way into the dustpan before long.
Then comes a legion of scribblers. In the grotto at Beni-Hassan, the walls of which are covered with pictures of scones in the daily life of the ancient Eryptians, among them of a procession, believed to be by some the arrival of Joseph and his Brethren, " J. B. Salter, Francis Abrahams, dragoman, Nov., 1856," occupies something lke four feet square, written with a charred stick over the paintings, while on the cciling, the deli. cate colouring and chaste pattern of which any decorator of the present day might advantageously copy, there is " W. Stevenson, 1855," in letters nearly a foot long each, with the smoke of a candle. Who these gentlemen are I have no idea; but there are plenty of the same sort. I see at the Viceregal Palace that your paper renetrates there, and you would confer a benefit upon te whole ,vi1i7ed world, and upon Egypt in particular, could you do anything that might lead the preservation of the most interesting monuments the world contains.

This, however, has now been done, and we have no doubt that the smsall balance of Exchequer-bills still required will beready for issue in ten days, instead of a

Every paragraph bears witness to the increased prosperity of the colony, is fraught with well-grounded hopes for the future, and contains valuable suggestions on matters affectirg the social and moral podition of the people. The increase which has taken place in the productions of the soil of Canada, which we have on several occasions pointed out, constituting as they do the basis of wealth and proeperity, aro appropriately noticed in the opening passages of the speeeb. The increaso which has taken place in the trade of the colony is measured by tho growth of the revenue and the value of tho imnprted goods. Last year the total revenue derived from the Cnstoms' duties was 1,069,0141., against 830,474L colleeted in the previous year, while the value of the goods imported was over 10,000,0001., against 8,000,0001. in the preceding 12 monts.

On one occasion, when under confinement in the guardroom awaiting his committal, he broke from arrest, and was retaken. He was then confined in one of the coUs, and succeeded in escaping thence by ingeniously removing the lock of the door, and having been absent about four months he returned to the garrison, and, having been triedbycourt-martial for desertion, he was sentenced to receive 50 lashes and to be discharged Her Majesty's service with ignominy, The first part of the sentence was remitted by order of the commandant. Hu having been pronounced an incorrigible delinquent, regardless of discipline, he was thus publicly stripped of his military bearings and escorted, to the music of the " Rogue's MIarch" as far as the barrack boundaries betweenl a file of armed soldiers, where he was set at large.

Her Majesty's Theatre.
HER MAJrES2rS THEATRE.
Tho programme for the ensuing season, which, according to announcement, will commenco on the 14th of April, Is just issued. Madamo Alboni and Mademoiselle Piccolomini stand high upon tho list of artists as established favourite, and two new prmc donnr are to be added to the attractions of the year. These are MIadame Spezia, who has gained a high reputation in the grander line of lyrical tragedy, and Mademoiselle Ortolani, whose talent is displayed in impersonations of the lighter and gentler kind, Another new engagement is Signor Antonio Giuglini, a tenor of wide celebrity, whoso d*dtU is anticipated with much curiosity by tho musical connoisseurs of the metro. polis. Nor wil their suspense be of long duration, as Ixo will open the season with Madamo Spezia in Lai Faw riz- Signori BcUetti, Boneventano, and Bosd remain in the establishment, and thero will bo a new basso profonde in the person of Signor Vlaletti, of MJilan.
The announcement of Don aiornni, to be produoed "with the perfection of cnscmble and details necessary to realize the intention of ita great autbor," is one of the most Interesting features of the programme, as it seems to indicato an intention on the part of Mr. Lumley to emulate the great Shakespeoaian "revivals" of Mr. Charles Kean in the production of Mozart's chf clrumrc. The throe ladics, Mesdames Piccolnomini, Spezia, and Ortolani, will be combined in the cast.
The list of choregraphic artists is long and imposing. Madame Rosasi will bring over with her a diterti4smCmnt founded on the ballet .3arco Spada, which MM. Auber and ScribearenowpreparingfortheFrenchAcad6mie on thebasin of their owvn opera. Mademoisclle Marie Taglioni will appear In a new baUct, composed expressly for her by her fatherMademoislle Boschetti and Katrine, who made so sucessful a dab.it last year, will bo among the luminaries of the ensuing season, and we shall have a new candidate for T.chorean immortality in Mademoisolle Pocchini, who
wzlopen the season in tho revived baVd, La Esmeerad. Thus thero will bo no want of excitement on the first niDht.
;ignor Bonetti remains the director and conductor of the music, and the orchestra has been strengthened b the engagements of Signor Pezze, fir6t violonoeUo of .Scala, and Signor Girandoli first contrabasso of Bergamo.
The zeal with wWich the public suiported the "old house" on its re-opening last year, and the loyalty of the artists, who never alloveda^singloedisappoinment to occur during the vvhole trinmphant seasnof1S5G are gracefully prgammowe.g b I.Llcy in tho prefa~tery part of hiis

Iain deeplyattached to the principles of the Protestant Church of EngIslIdas by l,w ett,blished.
Withnut ecrtif iing my independence, I am prepared to rank myself with the Cownervative psrty, irdoer the leadership of Lord Derby, beleving sincerely thatthe spirit of true Conservatism isso far from betng antaconistic to change that it ia always anxious to redress real grevauces -o improve decaying isotitutions. and to advance the public grod i-y every wise refonn which tho progree3 of timo may seem to require, It is also through the Conservative party alone, as I think. that the iiteeicr, of the owners. occupiers, and cultivators of the soil are orcashe. adequately eoprepsened. Ineedscarcelyaddthatthose are the inn' rests which I have most a' heart.

I triust, however, that the day is not far distant wben peace rosy be restored. snd that the HousA of Commons wil be enabl1ed to turn Its attention to such meanires of economy and retrenchment in the public exPes-ditne as may not be inconsistent with thorough efft'iency in the

LONDON, THURSDAY, MARCH 19, 1857.
The House of Lords sat for a short time yesterday, at 12 o'clock, when several bills were forwarded a stage.
In the House of Commons, the Speaker's Retirement BiU was read a third time and passed.
The SPEA}xn expressed his acknowledgments to the House for this mark of their approbation of his services, and for the noble and generous manner in which those services had been rewarded.
Other Bills were likewise read a third time and passed.
Mr. FAGAx moved the second reading of the Mlinisters' Money (Ireland) Bill.
Mr. BAGwELL and Mr. MEAGaE:R spoke in favour of the measure.
Mr. HorsAwN stated the intentions of the Government with regard to this question. Considering the di9iculty experienced in1 collecting the tax, and that the attempt to enforce it by litbgation was futile, the Government had come to the conclusion that the only adequate remedy was that suggested by the Committee of 1847,the spirit of which was embodied in this BiU-namely, the abolition of the tax.
Mr. G. A. A3aILToN protested against this mode of dealing with the matter, and moved to defer the second reading of the Bill for three weeks.
Admiral JoNEs seconded this amendment.
The Bill was supported by Mr. MAcumz, rar. BLACx, Mr. BEAimsn, and Mr. CowA.v.
Lord PALximSTON said the Ministers' money would be provided out of the resources of the Ecclesastical Commissioners, by whom the amount was at present advanced.
After some further discussion, the amendment was negatived, and the Bill was read (formally) a second time, being ordered to be committed that day three months.
Certain Bills were withdrawn, and other bills were introduced.
In reply to questions,
Mr. Wnsor stated that the only line of telegraphic communication between India and Europe with regard to which the Government had entered I into any engagements was that froxaSeleucia to the Persian Gutlf, and the onlly assistance to be given to
the company would be in th3sbape of payment for work- done when the line was completed.
In answer to a question put by Mr. OTlyW
IOrd PALxmSTON said; the affairs of the Wallachian Provinces were now in a train of settlement; the Austrian troops had begun to evacuate the provinces, Divans were about to asemble to make arrangements for the future settlement of the country, and he had no doubt that the Wallachian refugees would be allowed to return to their homes.
The House adjourned, at half-past 2 o'clock, until Saturday.
The set made against Sir JOHN BOWRING by the
The set made against Sir JoHN BowxRseG by the loudest section of the popular party illustrates what rome humourists have called the " snobbish " tendencies of the British people. There is no truth that is better known at head-quarters, or that is more recognized in statecraft; but it has never, that we can remember, received so signal a proof as in this instance. The man of the people must remain the man of the people,-merely that, not a bit more; otherwise he becomes the suspicion, the aversion, the victim of the people. If he made speeches, he must be content with making speeches, and satisfy body and soul with abundance of bitter words. If he began with stringing together statistics, let him still string together statistics, and die in his proper place in the last column of a tabular statement. But he must not take office, or associate himself with power. Woe betide hin if he ever accepts the least share of that responsibility which he spent his earlier years in checking and defining. If he trip or falter he is gone at once. It is the general instinct of gregarious animals, especially of the lower sort. Kine and sheep certainly molest an ailing member of the flock. Wolves devour a wounded wolf. Mackerel and herrings, and, it is said, even walruses, fall upon a sick or wounded companion, and finish him shortly. So this is one more case in which poor man is reminded of his afflnities with the inferior creation. On a very superficial view of things it might be supposed that the people would protect their own order; but a man of the people who takes office forsakes his order in the estimation of a considerable part of it. He must not advance from the ranks. Common soldiers, we are sometimes assured-though whether it be always true we cannot say-cannot be brought to respect officers promoted from the ranks. They will have the born gentleman. They like to see their officers thoroughly in with the rest, as good as the rest, and as bad as the rest, without an obtrusive degree of personal merit. This is certainly the case with the mass of the people. It is one source of the great difference between towns and the country. In towns everybody suspects everybody of a covert intention of getting over his head, so there is always an instinct stronger than any conspiraoy to pull down the upstart. If he falls, he gets it with a vengeance. In country society there are also jealousies and quarrels, but there is a strong prevailing disposition to back up the whole circle. This becomes stronger as we mount upwards to the aristocracy, the nobility, and certain high regions of families intermarried a hundred times over, confederate and compact. In these quarters they never give up anybody if they can help it. The indulgence and toleration of high British life are enormous. There is scarcely anything that they wil not overlook, and even defend. Neither of these extremes can be right, but one of them certainly is more offensive than the other as a matter of taste; and taste is only an index to a good deal more.
As we have observed, there is no fact more appreciated in politics, though it is not often avowed. When a man is making a Cabinet, or filling up a lower place in his Administration, he has to consider not merely personal merit and fitness, but all the elements of strength. To strengthen himself-and he cannot exiSt without strength-he must get strong men. But, of course, a colleague is all the stronger for being well backed and supported. So a Minister likes a servant who will have 20 great families-a whole order, rise up in his defence, when he wants a defence, as all men do at one time or another. He is not so fond of the worthy man, who may be ever so able, clever, honest, and everything else, but has nothing but his own legs to stand upon and his ovwn backbone to keep him strhght. Ee knows that Lord This and the Hon. That will be carried with eying colours through the womt of scrapes, while plain Mlister, with al his excellent qualities and painstaking habits, has scores ready to trample upon him, and not a friend in the hour of need. Ve belibve this is the chief account of the common saying that men from the people get a Government into scrapes. Their scrapes remain scrapes, and grow into worse scrapes, because they have not the benefit of that class charity which covers a multitude of sins. The aristocracy does not love them, and the democracy hates them. Had a Duke, being Governor at Hongkong, gone into this quarrel thrice as fast and thrice as furious as Sir Joui BowNG, he would have had a good majority of the Commons in his favour. A Dukedom goes for so much. The people believe in it, worship it, and obey it. Accordingly, when a Plenipotentiary was to be found, and people were thinking of distinguished Generals and such cattle, Lord PALMERSTON knew better. He must have a Duke, or at least an Earl, and happily he has found a good one. Should the Earl make a mess of it, he will not be devoured by his own kind; he wiU not have his oldest friend with a firm gripe on his haunches, he will not feel himself garotted by his bosom companion, or feloniously attacked in the rear by the associate of a life's labours in the cause of the people. What all this comes to is that the People is not an Order. It is the rude material out of which Orde!rs may be created or renovated, but it is not itself a class, a fraternity, or anything but a sort of mob. It is not true to itself. It has no chivalry in its own cause. The assertion admits of a thousand proofs, but no other is wanted than the treatment of Sir JoHN BownixG, a conscientious, careful man, who has made it the chief studyof his life to promote the interests of humanity and peace. Though a man of the people, he receives from some of the most prominent men of the people-his own old friends-the coldest distrust, the most ill-natured interpretations of conduct and language, the imputation of the worst motives, abandonment, and downright persecution.
Of course a man of the people may, if he goes the right way, and if he is favoured by fortune, escape out of that cold bitter region into the more genial climate of the aristocracy. He may do everything that is against the interest of the people. He may devote himself to the acquisition of wealth, he may aly himself to great families, he may ape the habits and pretend the tastes of those above him. He may make popular speeches at
public meetings, but be exclusive in private life, gradually throw off first one old friend, then another, spend for himself aned his new friends, give up all serious attempts to elevate the condition of the mass oi the people, and in this way be grafted into the aristocracy. He must, however, renounce the popular element, for the more the people are reminded that he ever was one of them the more will popular jealousy stand in his way. It is often said in praise of. English ociety that therein a man of the people can take his place in the first order. It is true, but theri he must forget the people, and dissociate himself from them, except on the grandest occasions, when he earries his popular emblems about him, as he emblazons on his carriage
the bear which aremote ancestor Illed. SirR.PzzL retainedto the last strong ympathiesforthe people, and Tras a popular Mtinister. The result was that he met with as tauch supicion and jealousy from men of the people as he did from those verY classes who conceived themselves directly injured by his measres. This is not a flattering view of English society, but we are talking not of the people, but of a certain forward class of public men who assume to represent them, and to be in a special sense "men of the people." They are men of the same class, very much of the same popular, philanthropic, and rather doctrinaire school as Sir J. BowRmK. In his aituation the presumption is they would have done the same, if so welL But the prophet has no honour in his own country, or witlh his own class. Because these men know Sir J. BowRInG and all about him, they look on him as one of themselves, without respect or confidence, and give way to all the feelings which faction or jealousy may suggest. What is to be the end of this ? Is it that the British people are inveterately "snobbish ;" that they will have the " governing "classes" to rule over them and for them and no other, and worship titles to the end of the chapter? It certainly looks like it. We are a mixed race of conquerors and conquered. We are still divided into Normans and Saxons, even though on either side there be many deserters. The classes, the ideas, the feelings remain, and the Saxons, long bent to the burden, honest old drudges, will be governed by none but Normans, whether Normans by blood or adoption. How many a good Saxon have we seen abandoned and crushed in our time ! Perhaps we ought not to quarrel with the instincts of a conquered race, ignominious as they are; but it has also other instincts, and they are those to which we are now giving utterance.
After reading forty or fifty electioneering
After reading forty or fifty electioneering addresses in succession one arrives at some interesting general results. Onxe is, that no two of them are-incredible as it may appear-exactly alike. Even the same precise past and the same precise future, the same acts and the same promises, the self-same opinions on Parliamentary Reform, Balot, the Maynooth question, Churchrates, and Sir Joxn BowxRio, assume a different external mould and form. Some adopt the short, pithy, and others the long, sonorous style. Some have obviously read the Spectator at one time of their lives, and affect elegance. Frankness, hiimility, zeal, and discretion we find to be aU in their turn electioneering virtues, and each is represented. The poet talks of the seven ages of man, but the ages of electioneering man may, perhaps, be reduced to three. There is, in the first place, the ardour of first courtship, when the untried candidate breathes the freshness of early promise and longs for the opportunity of exhibiting proofs of his generous devotion. To this class belongs the address ofI Mr. NxEsTE, at Oxford, who runs fuU tilt at " the increasing power and the increasing " selfisbness of the aristocracy of wealth," which have made it almost impossible " for honest industry "to better its lot, or unendowed talent to rise to "its proper level." He is prepared to lead a crusade against this monster abuse, and repeat the combat of ST. GEROBE with the Dragon in right earnest. These spring candidates are in keeping with the time of the year; but there are varieties of them, aud the young heir apparent who comes forward at the age of 21 to supply the place of a retiring father or grandfather is the early snowdrop or crocus of electioneering horticulture. The ardour of first courtship is succeeded again by the sober affection of wedded love, when the candidate has represented the constituency in some three or four Parliaments. This is the second electioneering age, when the hon. member alludes modestly to past services, regular attendance at the House, judicious votes, and, at any rate, the very best intentions. The third.and last age is represented in the address of Sir CHARLE&S BuRnRLL to the electors of Shoreham, ia which he says that, " having represented " the constituency upwards of 50 years, there is no " occasion for him to enter into any explanation "of his political principles,"
The Chinese question is of course prominent, and after one or two vague generalities the candidate usuaUy begins his Chinese paragraph. But here we note a great difference. The supporter of Government evidently likes the subject, as being, in the electioneering sense, a good one. He appeals at once to great national principles, on which he knows the popular feeling will be with him; he denounces factious coalition with a swing, and his sentence goes off like the crack of a whip. He feels his advantage on that question with a constituency of which the leading and moving part is perfectly able to see through the thin humanitarian disguise which the struggle for office has assumed. But the member who has voted in the majority as evidently does not like the subject, though he knows he must face it. He swaUows the pill by an effort, and is very glad to get it over. There are, however, different ways even of doing this. There is the prosy apologetic, like Mr. RusT's, who goes over the Chinese question agrain with the electors of Huntingdonshire, and concludes with a great deal about conscientious conviction, sense of duty, impartial consideration of the subject, and the like, the value of which, when it al happens exactly to coincide with the Opposition side of the House, is very obvious. There is the short apologetic, when the candidate disposes of a disagreeable subject by
one uneasy bolt, such as Colonel STUARTl adopts to the electors of Cardiff. "On the
Chinese question he is not asltaned to find "himself agreeing -with Mr. CoBDm." This is short and summary, and the Colonel has mastered the policy so often recommended of stating a conclusion without giving the reasons. But, though it is only one mouthful, it is obviously an unpleasant one. Why does Colonel STuART say he is "not " ashamed" of his vote? That is a very poor thing to say; he ought by rights to be proud of it, to be glad to point to it, to wear it as a feather in his cap. Is this aU that a man who has just aided in a great philanthropic triumph, a splendid victory of benevolence and justice over unprincipled cruelty, can say,-that he is " not "ashamed" of it? There could not be a clearer sign that Colonel STUART was ashamed of his vote; indeed, as a rule, when a man assures us he is 7wt ashamed, it may generaly be inferred that he is. Nor has it less the appearance of this when the Colonel attempts, as he does, to cover his obnoxious vote with a whole cloud of liberal promises and cries-the BaUot, Extension of the Suffrage, and Abolition of Church-rates. We must observe that even Mr. BiGxnT is short on this subject:-" I entirely approve the resolution moved "by Mr. CoBDEN and seconded by M1r. GiBsox on "the subject of the melancholy events at Canton." We might have expected something more from
Er. BRIGuT upon a great philanthropic triumph than the very short matter-of-fact statement, which he words with a sort of dry exactness, " the reso"lution moved by Mr. CosDEN and seconded by "Mr. GIBsoN." This is. not quite the way in which a man alludes to a topic which he loves. Why does not Mr. BRIGnT enlarge upon this " glorious victory," this bright spot in the annals of Parliament, when a majority of the House of Commons generously declared forthe rights of humanity, and protected the defencelets against the strong ?
What is it which holds his pen, and stop.; the stream of congratulatory eloquence I Surely, having been prevented by a reason which we must all lament from expressing himself in Parliament on this question, he was the more bound to use the opportunity which an address tQ his constituents afforded; but he rather ungraciously disposes of the whole subject in these two words, and immediately goes off to the Persiau War, upon which he spends a long paragraph. Is Mr. BRiorIT aware that a large part of the constituency of 3Manchester shares the feeling which a great mercantile nation must have on this subject, and resents the insult offered to British commerce in making our commercial connexions with the vast empire of China the mere tool for a party move and advancement to office ? And why, we ask with some surprise, does Mr. Conox; himself wholly omit his own subject in his fareWell address to the West Riding ? Was it fronm bashful reluctance to allude to his own victory, or because he did not thinkl it would be a very pleasant one?
It is very symptomatic that several candidates in their addresses immediately rush from the disagreeable subject of the vote by which the Ministry was left in a minority in this Parliament to general promises of support to Lord PALxEERSToi'S Governutent in the next Parliament. Sir EThuRy MEBx promises Lord PAL31FRSTOW "his unhesitating support in any measure "which may be necessary for the speedy and effec"tual termination of the war in China and the con" clusion of peace upon terms vwhich will be consis-
tent with MAc diSgnity of Great Britain,"-' n an-
nouncement which leaves the hon. men7er as' much room as the most devoted supporter of Lord PAL,TERSTON could want. MIessrs. KES
SLvYn-x, FLoyra, and STUT, in their joint address, assure the electors of Dorsetshire that
since the formation of the Government of Lord "PALMrETsvoX they have on many occasions "given him their support, and have no in-
tention of changinig the course hitherto pur"sued by them." In explaining their vote against Ministers candidates feel it is rubbing against the grain, it is one continual disclaimer and anxious disavowal of motives which they know nine-tenths of the world will attribute to them. If they can say anything, then, about a support in promise for Lord PALuNmRsToN, they take immnediate refuge in the future as a harbour of safety and protection from the past, where in still water they can at last enjoy a little repose, and not be tossed about by the adverse winds of popular disgust.
The position of affairs at Canton, as described
The position of affairs at Canton, as described in the intelligence just received from China, accords pretty exactly with the anticipations which might have been formed from ourprevious knowledge of the circumstances. After the first collision Admiral SFYvroun remained on his guard, in expectation of reinforcements and instructions from home, while the Chinese Governor, having proclaimed his resolution of resisting our demands, was left, of course, to make the best of his resources for opposing and annoying us. The actual results correspondc with the speculat'ons which this state of things would have suggested. Our force was strong enough for attack, but not for occupation, and we have therefore retired from some of the posts we had seized, exactly as we retired from the city itself after penetrating to its interior; but our intelligence expressly states that the evacuation of these two or three positions was occasioned, not by any pressure or advance on the part of the Chinese, but by the demands made upon our small force for the security of Hongkong. The tactics of YEH and the Cantonese have been adapted in like manner to the situation of affairs. They have availed themselves of their numbers and of the features of the scene of war to give us such annoyance as they could, and to improve any advantage presenting itself. The Canton waters comprise a multitude of shaUow creeks, navigable only for vessels of light draught, from which, as from so many protected harbours, junks may issue in swarms to attack any ship found at a disadvantage. The amphibiotus habits of the population, so graphically portrayed in Sir J. Bow N&G's own description, would necessarily yield an infinite supply of boats of all classes, and we are told accordingly that the shoals of these craft and of war junks also in the Canton River were daily increasing. The Sampson in steaming up, and the Encounter in coming down, were both attacked by these hornets without being able to reach them in return, but one casualty only is recorded, and the advantages of the Chinese in this respect wiU disappear as soon as our gtnboats arrive on the scene.
Upon the whole, notwithstanding the opinions expressed in the House of Lords to the contrary, we think it beyond al question that the ascendancy of our arms has been successfully maintained, nor is it necessary, in confirmation of such a view, to do more than point to the simple purport of the inteUigence just received, and the date under which it was despatched. WYe are now informed of events in China up to the 30th of January last, three whole months after the final and positive rupture. In this period there has surely been time enough for the development of any plan of operations on the part of the Chinese, whereas, with the exception of the junk attacks already noticed, and the poisonings and assassinations, of which we have heard the worst, we have suffered nothing whatever, nor have we withdrawn from any position, except in pursuance of resolutions dictated by other considerations than those of the enemy's force upon the spot. In another point of view, too, our situation furnishes distinct evidence of the advantage we had gained. The Chinese ENs'PRon had forbidden hostilities against us at the other ports, a command which indicates both a salutary impression of our power and a disinclination to adopt the quarrel of Commissioner
YE1.
The debate, however, in the House of Lords brought out very strikingly the great and original difficulty of these transactions. Lord GREY observed, that our means having proved insufficient for the enforcement of our demands, we were reduced, after our first efforts, to " a state of
ignominious defence" while waiting for succours, and Lord ELLENEOROUGH thought that Sir J. BowIN-o should have foreseen the chance of such a dead lock from the known obstinacy of YES. But at wiat point of the proceedings, we beg to ask, could our stand have been taken with any better effect? Let us assume that at the moment YESr committed an offence against the British flag our authorities were cognizant of his temper and disposition ;-what were they to do ? They could not possibly on any such grounds have abstained from requiring reparation, for that would have been simply tantamount to encouraging the Commissioner in the assumption of all the licence he chose to take. Having demanded reparation, they could not forbear insisting on their demands, for that would have left the matter worse still. Suppose, then, that they had stopped short at the seizure of the junk, or at the capture of the Barrier F ts, or at any point short of that at which they did stop, where would have been the advantage? As YEU would have persisted in his obstinacy we should still have been left with our object unattained, and must have taken up a defensive and expectant position, exactly as we do now.
Lord Gitr's proposition amounts to this,that in dealing with a people like the Chinese we should strike no blow till we can striL-e a decisive
One, and not appeal to arms till we have the means of employing them irresistibly. We can certainly -understand this policy, and, for that matter, indeed, approve it too ; for the danger to which his ljordship aluded, of our instructing so imitative a people in the arts of war by small combats or dawdling operations, is sufficiently ob'vious. But how, unless we are always to mainiltain in the Canton River a force equal to the summary reduction of Caniton, is this difliculty to be 'escaped ? What is to be done in the case of offence noffered and reparation refused? To put up with the refusal patiently until an effective force could me collected would not be a likely method of im-pressing an enemy with any respect for our power, and might even lead him to presume upon a superiority so practically acknowledged. Failing the presence on the spot of an overwhelming armament there must needs occur, either at once or at the particular stage where the proceedings were confessed to be ineffectual, some such a defensive halt as that now complained of.
We cannot, however, subscribe to Lord GREy'S -opinion, that the " defence" in question is in any manner an ignominious one. The force at the command of our authorities has not been asufficient to compel to submission a governor of a -anguinary and violent disposition determined on Tesistance, but it has proved fully equal to the repulse and defeat of the Chinese, notwithstanding all their progress in military science, -At every point where they have been en-countered. We captured all the forts we -ttacked, carried off or destroyed all the guns, - oc cpied every position we desired to occupy, and *ev&i breached the city wall and penetrated to YEn'S own residence. All this we did with the amall amount of force at our disposal; in fact, except the retention of our conquests, it is hard -to see what we could have done more. Having necomplished this much without bringing YEn to terms we have preserved a position upon which he has not succeeded during a period of three months in making any impressionl. In such proceedings we -certainly fail to discover any trace of " igno-
miny.,
Whatever persuasions may have been current respecting the dealings and character of the Chinese Governor, it is perfectly evident from the -despatches that the steps successively taken to oDbtain redress were expected one after another to -prove effectual. It was at first hoped that the seizure of the junk would be sufficient, and then -that the capture of the Barrier Forts would answer -the purpose in view. " I cannot coniceive it pos"sible," says Consul PAKiiES, " that his Excel" lency will, then, withhold compliance with our "demands." Whether this presumption -was uniwarranted at the time or not we cannot pretend to say. That it proved to be vain we now lknow; but our position could certainly not bave been improved by otur avoiding even a trial *of the resources at our command. We were brought to a standstill simply because our means of coercion, though more powerful than those which had been found effective on former occasions, proved insufficient to subdue the extraordinary -obstinacy of a single official. This might or raight not have been anticipated, but the difficulty in any case would have remained the same '%vhen once the cause of quarrel had been established. We could stop short at a word, without venturing upon a blow; or we could deliver the best blow possible and trust to its -efficacy. Our authorities chose the latter course, and we think wisely, for, though the attempt was not absolutely successful, there was a good chance of its being so, in which case all further trouble ivould have been saved, and we have at any rate no reason to be dissatisfied with the manifest ascendancy of our arms.

Pimlico Improvements!
PIMiSLICO IMPROVBMBNTS,
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I observe among the notices of motions for toniight one for an extension of time of an " Act to effect Im. Wprovements in Pimlico and the neighbourhood of Bucking. tEam Palace" by Sir B. Hall.
Now, Sir, this Is all very well so far as it suits the conve. nience of the Comminsioners of Her Majesty's Public Works -and Buildings, but how about us tradesmen and residents vho unfortunately stand in the way of the said " improve. rnents ?" Is it common justice that we should be kept in the present "' glorions uncertainty of the law" if Act after Act is to be put on one side? The present Act is the second for the same purpose, and will expire in the ensuing -August. And now they ask for an extension of the same Act, without stating, at least to us, how long the said ex-tension is to extend positively and for the last time.
I understand the purchase of the Gun Tavern is just -completed. This was the only impediment, according to the Ute *W. Molesworth. Will it take a few more months or a fk more years to purchase the rest of us?
I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

-ELECTION INTELLIaENCE.
BUORINGHAMISE.
Mr. Disraeli has issued the following address to his constituents:-
"TO TIIR RLECTOBS OF THE COUNTy OF BUCKINGOIM.
"Gentlemen,-The House of Commons having, by a solemn vote, in which the leading men of all parties concurred, cenmured the cruel and double-dealing policypursued by the Agents of the Government towards the Chinese, Parliament has been dissolved.
" Since the announcement of the disolution the Minis. ter has declared that his agents in China will bo superseded, thus acknowledging the justness of the vote of the House of Commons.
" It is elear, therefore, taat the plea for dissolution is a pretext. What then is the real object?
"To wasto a year.
"Lord Palmerston is an eminent man, who has deserved well of his country; but as Prime Minister he occupies a false position. He is the Tory chief of a RPadical Cabinet, With no domestic polioy, he is obliged to divert the attew tion of the people, from the consideration of their own affairs, to the distraction of foreign politics. His external system is turbulent and aggressive that his rule at home may be tranquil and unassaied. Hence arise excessive expenditure, heavy taxation, and the stoppage of all social improvement.
His schenme of conduct is so devoid of all political prin. ciple that when forced to appeal to the people his only claim to their confidence is his name.
" Such arts and resources may suit the despotic ruler of a continental State exhausted by revolutions, but they do not become a British Minister governing a country proud, free, and progressive, animated by glorious traditions, and aspiring to future excellence.
" The honour and the best interests of the country require that men should be returned to the new Parliament with definite principles. If you will confer on me, for the fourth time, the high distinctioin of being your member, I will, as heretofore, uphold our con-.'i ion in Church and State, and support those popunir and aristocratic institutions which, in this countrv, have made power a privilege, but have extended the possession of that privilege to all who exert themselves to deserve it-institutions which have educated a nation to aspire and excel.
" The general policy which I would enforce at this juncture may be contained in these words,-Honourable peace reduced taxation, and social improvement.
" 1'hereis an attempt atlthe present day to playoffthe parties which exist, and have always to a certain degree existed in the Churcb, against each other for political objects. This is a dangerous course for Churchmen to sanction. The church vhich, irrespective of its higher functions, is one of the great guarantees of English happiness, has foes enough without seeking for them in her own bosom; and it would appear to me that, instead of quarrelling among themselves, Churchmen should evince&mutual forbearance, unite on the commnon ground of ecclesiastical polty, and oppose all efforts to impair the integrity of that Reformed Church of England which is the best security forthe religious liberty of al classes and creeds of Her Majesty's subjects.
"I have the honour to remain,
Your obliged and faithful servant,
" B. DISRAELI "Hughenden Manor, March 17."
BEVERLEY.-The Ron. W. H. F. Denison and lMr. W. Wels met the electors last (Wednesday) night. The only other candidate in the field is MIr. Edward Anchmuty Glover.
BR,ADFORD.-The friends of General Thompson are sanguine of success at the general election, as no third candidate is yet spoken of to occupy the place of Mr. Titus Salt, the Whig candidate, whose withdawal we have already announced. Mr. Wickham's committee and friends are unremlttinz in their labours to secure his return.
BRISTO.-Addresseshave beenissued from Messrs. H. Berkeley and H. G. Langton, the sitting members, soliciting ve-election. Mr. Berkeley, aftor referring to the length of time during which he has represented the city, and challenging any man, in 1857, to point to an oPiniOn changed or to a pledge broken since his furst return, uin 1837, says.
Upon the reverence paid to the fla g of a nation depends the re spect gen in ciilzed countries to the merchant who trades under that symbol of protection. In a country inhabited by feroctous pagas the dreadl of that flag Is the only safeguard for those who carry on commArse in cities where treachery is a virtue and murder an approved act. There are tbose who look anxiously for the time when the ameliorating influeuce of Christianity may lI gbten the darkness of that henighted land. The safety of the miSsionary is best accured by the union jackl, honoured and dreaded, waving above hbis head. I voted in support of Lord Palm erston against a coalition. I cannot conclude thie appeal to the electors of Bristol without saying one word on the subject of that question of Reform, o£ which the leading in the House of Commons has fallea upon me-I mean the question of the baUot. I csunot for an histant treat as a party question a movemeDt which has for his object freedom or conscience and freedom of ction to elewtora, let their political creed be what it may. I know that the Liberal portion of Parliamentary electors consider this freedom from restraint their right. ,and I do not behere that the Tory part of the electoral body view the conservation of that right as hostile to their political interests."
Mr. Langton, referring to the division which necessitated the dissolution, says:-
In recording my vote in favour of her MIajesty's Govermnent on the question of the late occurrences in China I did so from the conviction that the honour of our national nlag, the safety-the very existeauce of our commercial relations and establishments in distant countries, and the integrity of our power in the East, wonid be endangerect by the adoption of the motion introduced by hlr. Cobden, and supported by a coaUition of the most incongeuonn character. The foreign policy of Lord Palmerston has been unjustly described as 'turbailen and aggressive,' bet the country, in pronouncing their judgment, wiU not forget th4t it has conducted the great war in which we were engaged to a sumessdcl termination: and has procured for us a Peace wbich is likely to maintaia a nd consolidate the balance of power In Europe."
Up to the present time there is no tangible sign of any opposition to the return of the pres ent members.
CnE5TEST.-For the representation of this city Mr. G. Salisbury, a large gas proprietor, has entered the field in oppostion to Mr. H. R. Grenfell. Both Mr. GrenfeUl and Mtr. Salisbury are in the Liberal interest, but the latter possesses local claitns which many of the electors believe entitle him to preference. His principles are thns stated in his address:-
"My politioal sentiments ar9 not unknown to you, and upon the principal questious of Who Fhould vote and 'I ow the rote sbould bh recordedat an election r I am bound to say that birthright, serritude, education, and taxation are qualLfletions which entitle a Man,
in my opinion, to the former; and thatin the latter cate I am,like Mr. Grenfell, an advocate for the ballot. All measures intended to improveTour financial and fiscal affairs shall hlve my best support, no matter by;whom introduced,;so, too, will I support the diffusion of educition, the reform of ogr criminal code, the opening of appoint. mnets In our naval, miiitry. and civil establishments to oieri. a more equal ditributlon of ecclesisatlea revenues, and al measores having for their object the social welfare of the people at large.'
CRICKLADE.-The two sitting members, Mr. Neeld and Mr. A. L. Goddard, offer themselves for re-election. A rumour having prevailed that Mr. Neeld intended to retire and offer himself for Chippenham, a requisition, signed by upwards of 500 electors, has been presented to him, urging him not to sever the connexion which has exieted through so many successive Parliaments, and to this request he hb¢ aceeded. Mr. Charles J. Monek, barrister, and son of -
late Bishop of Glocester and Bristol, has also, as statea yesterday, announced himself a firm supporter of Lord Palmerston, and he has already proceeded with a canvass. It may not ba generally knovn that this is a peculiarly constituted boroogh, partaking of the character of a small county, for, besides embracing the now populous and important town of Swvindon (wbich numbers alone 330 electors) and three other market-towns, it includes upwrards of 50 villages in the surrounding neighbourhood, comprising a constituency of nearly 1,700 electors. The borough and hundreds have not been contested since tho year 1837.
DBvoN (NORTHs).-Mr. G. S. Buck has resigned, and the only candidates now in the field are the Hon. Mr. Trefasis, eldest son of Lord Clinton, and Sir S. H. Northeote, Conservatives. A requisition is in course of signature asking Mr. J. N. BuUor, of Downes, and ehairman of the Bristol and Exete. Railway, to come forward on Liberal principles.
DuRiiAc)t (SOUTH).-Lord Harry Vane has issued his address. He says.-
"A rots adTarse tO the peliey of the OChinee war has given rise to a political crisis. On a subject of thli nature there must neeesarily be a diver;ity of opiuloos, but a heilef seemas to have gained currency that it was merely med by a coalition of politiciass ot various opinions as an engine to displace a Ministry. I am, at any rate, no party to such a coalition, nor have I any cognizance of its existence ; and my conviction is, notwithstanding the feeling of the present moment, that the calmer judgment of the pubi wil eventuaUy ra tify the propriety of that rote. The question=was whether we should confirm the conduct of agents who, without the authority of Government, and contrary to the spitt of intruetions from raseresive Secretsries of Stale, had engagedi us in hostilities to carry out thoir own v iewvs.
Lord Harry Vane is one of the "Liberals" who voted for Mr. Cobden's motion. lHis vote finds no favour among his constituentis, if we except the quakers, who are an influential body in South Durha n. A meeting of the Liberal electors iS cled for Friday at Darlngton, to take measures to secure the retulrn of two Liberals. A meeting of the non-electors
extension of the franchise. q e an
EXPITER-Sir John Duckworth has resigned, and the candidates now remaining are Mr. Divett (Liberal) and Mr. R. S. Gard (Conservative). The friends of Sir J. Duckworth are getting up a requisition, asking the hon. baronet to reconsider his determination, and to come forward again.
HA.,TS (SOUTs).-A. very influential meeting of the Liheral electorsof thispartof the county washeld yesterday (Wednesday) at the Royal Hotel, Southampton, Sir John Barlker 1l of Mottiafont Abbey, in the chair. Among the gentlemen present were Mr. J. Bonham-Carter, MP. for Winchester ; Mr. Nightingale, of Embley-park ; Mr. Ralph Etwall, Mr. John Drew, Mr. C. Brett, hIr. J. Theobald, &c. Resolutions in support of Sir Jervoise Clarke Jervoise, of [dsworth, were unanimously adopted, and a large committee was apwointed for tle polling district of Soathampton. The hon. baronat was present. A strong desire was also expressed that a Liberal colleague should be procured, and it was unanimously resolved that Msiy. Henry Bonhoen-Carter, brother of the member for Winhester, sbou!4 be. invited to come forward. The. names of this gentimasL was received with loud cheers. Sir a eX Jervoise khaiesued his address, in which he says,-
""DpXeasasou tl, rrants .m acceptance of tbe Invitation is the
s.l'Ue'tLord P 4,tg. s,tk tlstzountry; the 4esire to rseposl to it.
I ya ready testimony to his calm, courgus, Sad veblotl, bearing during the eventful periodof hs admintratIo, and the reolatlon to SUPPort himn while he so beneficially carries on the Government at home and maintains the honour of his cowwtsy abroaL.
HREFORDSHIIt-A Liber2l candidate has appeared in the field, in the person of Sir Henry Geers Cotterell, of Garnons, in this county. In hisaddress Sir Henrysays:-
"' I come forwarn on true liberal prinnlplea, and If you do me the hosour to setect me I shall give a decded but independent support to the pretent Gorsremment, s I feel asured tbat Lord FLneou, In maling the Britlah nation justly respeted abroad and upholding the honour of the Britlsb dar, will best secure the blessings ot pe0w at home. I smn the stroleuous advocat of as enllghteneland liberaI plicy in allmters of internail governmeut, by ijudicou, raforms, including the extension ot the eletoral franchise, so as careflay to preserve the spirt of our institutions and advance their pr-
tical utui:y. In gmrdnally adapting the pubho exmendltsre to A peace eitablishment I shall be prepared to support all measues of economy which Dy appear conducive to the Uatlonslinteress. lamasupporterofciTil andreligiousliberty; and Amditpo!ed to act with equal fairness towards the members of asl
Christian denominatIlons; at the same time I rejolce over the exoellent appolntments recently made by Lord Palierston to high post
tlonD in the churc. I am desirous of seeing established such a System ot education as would seme to all clases the advantages of sound relglons and secular education."
The hon. candidate is a grandson of the late Sir John G. Cotterell, who for so many years represented the county in Parliament. The three sitting membors have issued a joint address soliciting the honour of re-election. The statement which has been published that the three members for this c ,unty voted in favour of Mir. Cobden's motion on the China question is incorrect. Mr. Blakemore and Mr. ling were absent, and Captain Hanbury only supported the niotion. The absence of tbe two hon. gentlemen at such a crisis has been freely commented on.
HEREFORD3HILE.-The three Conservative sitting mem-
bers have coalesced, inanticipation of the threatened oppo-l sition. The fourth candidate, however, has not yet made his appearance in the field.
HULL.-The Hon. W. H. F. Denison having elected to stand for Beverley, a meeting of the Liberal committee was held on Tuesday afternoon, for the purpose of choosing a second candidate in his'place. Several names were mentioned, among them that of Mr. T. Mitchell, M.P. for Bridport, was received with great favour. Lord WiUiam Compton, brother of the Marquis of Northampton, was one of the candidates spoken of. Ultimately it was resolved to adjourn the weeting until yesterday. Lord W. Compton arrived in the town by the midnight train on Tuesday, and yesterday morning was engaged in visiting several of the ieaing Liberals. Ic was announced that Mr. Mitchell would not come to Hull. An Pddress is posted from Mr. W. D. Seymour, barrister, professing most liberal opions. The baUot, extension of suffrage, law and commercial re. form are all in his creed; and he promises en independent support to Lord Palmerston. At the tinre our despatch left the Liberals were holding their meeting, and there can be little doubt that Mr. Clay and Lord W.Comptonwili be chosen as the two Liberal candidates. The Tories sought Lord Ashley as their candidate, but he declined the honour; and the rumour now is that Mr. Dick-son, who fought their battle for them last time, wiU he their man again.
ISLE OF WlHr1T (COvnvTY).-We are informed Colonel Harcourt, thesitting member (Conservative), retirea, leaving the field open to lUr. Charles Cavendish Clifford (Liberal), the Private Secretary to the Premier.
KIDDERMISySvTER.-Mr. Lowe has completed his canvass and issued another address to the electors, stating that he has no doubt of his success, and adding -
"I rejoico in the suocess not ouly on my own account, but because t affords a fair omen of the course which tho country is about to take inthecoming general election, and of the triumph which awaits the cause of truth and justice now referred to the d ecision of the people.'
LEEDS.-The Right Hon. M. T. Baines and Mr. Robert H all, Conservative, are the only two candidates fairly before
te electors, but the Liberal conimittee are exerting themselves to proeure a Liberal to go with MIr. Bainea. The followviur address has been issned by the Right Hon. M. T.
"A dissolution of Parliament being immedisatly at hand, 11 beg leave to sollit the high honour of again representing my natlvs town intheHouseof Commons Mypolitcalprin ciple are ell knownto you. I stated them frankly and faLy when you firet elected me. as weli as on each of the two subsequent occa lons on which I have been honoured with tho ranewal of your confidence. I steadfastly adhere to them alL As a member of the present Administr ation, I trust that Ita conduct and policy, taken as a whole, have bee n such as to meet with your approvaL You remem'er the gallant spirit with which Lord Palmession undertook the Government st a sasson of great national gloom and despondency. You saw the energy and vigour with which he coaducted the ItusaLan wAr, and his promDtitude to restore peace at the earlie3t moment when It could be obtained upon safe and honouraole terms. You have subsequently seen the vigi-ance and firmness with which in the course of last autumu he repelled an audacious attempt t) evade one stipulatlon of the Treaty of Peae, particularly important to the commerce of Europe, I mean that providing for the free and uninterrupted navigation of the Danube. Whatever difference3 of opinion may exist with regard to some of the late proceedings at Canton, no one can doubt that in refusing to disavow and condemn the conduct of British Officers, who, at a distance of 12 0t0 miles from home had acted honestly and according to the best of their judgment in circumstances of great difficulty Lord Palmerston adopted a course which he believed to be just and gencrous towards those officers themsolves and best calculated to secure the ZIes and property of our fellow-conutrymen throughout the oast. His domestic policy has been directed to develope the priuciples of free trade, to Promote legal, commerciaL and social reforms, and to render the Church more etfhi
clent for its great andseacred purposes by placing in Its highest stations men eminent for piety, diligence, and faithfnlness In the hope of personally renewing to you, within a very short time, my alcnowlsdg. ments for all your past kindnes I have the honour to be, gentlemen, your most faithful servant, XI T. BALx.-London, March 14."
LtICESTEI-Mr. J. D. Harris has issued an address to the electors, in which he says:-
"The Government of Lord Palmer3ton has been one of energy sad decision, and I have no sympathy with that combination cf adverse Parties whosesuccessful opposition has precipitated the approachbng dissolutlon. Though an advocate of Peace, I would not support a timid and vaciUating poUcy, whichl would neither secure respect for our country nor the Btability or the empire."
He will support Parliamentary reform and the ballot, and adds:-
* -ly estimation of the 8abbath, not only as of Divine appointmen*, but a an Institution of the highest importance ina soidal point of view, especially to the induMous classes, would lead me strenuously tooppose anylegislativeinterference which would have atendency to assimilate it to Continental usages."
LcomlIsTrBR.-A contest has unexpectedly arisen here. Mr. Hardy and MIr. PhUllimore, as already stated, seek reelection; but Mr. Willoughby, who was a candidate for the borou"h in 1852, has issued en address, in which he o5*eis himseylf, and says:-
"I am firmly attached to our Protestant churchaud insUtuions, but friendby to clvil and relious liberty."
He is also an advocate for the diffusion of education in all classes and for economy in the public expenditure. The address of Mr. Gathorne Hardy thus alludes to the present
"The resolution of the House of Commons had my hearty suppor', as consonant alike with our national honour and the great Principle of humanity and justice. The unqualified approval which Her Majeatys Government gAve to the proceedings of our offiecals in China has involved them in the culpability which their subordinates have justly incurred. They complain of an unfair coDmbiationm jginst tWozm but I believe the decision of the House was the result oa the b neodt and independent judgment of those who had studled th e * o. the cese, and that the charges of a factIous and mnscruruloua . of parties are entirely fa:Ee and calumnious,"
KlkNCHESTE..-A deputation from uDW. "dP ,r 2,5 1 requisitionists waited upon Sir John Potte5 . n Tuesday to allow himself to be put ln nomination for 'r^ .1hester, and it was publicly announced yesterday that ha had assented. (By Electric Telegraph).-A crowdedmectingoftheelectors of Maachester took place last night at the Freetrade-hall, v,hich v.s addressed by Mr. Gibson and Mr. Cobden. Both gentlemenwerere-eivedwithgreatcheerl,g. Mr.Cobden,after Ataing that the cry upon which Government were goin to "be country was the cryof "Palmerston" only, diisoected at
reat length the political career of the noble lord for the tsst 50 years, and after reviewing his constant opposition to Liberal measures both in home and foreign pohcy, said,Is this the man to whom, at the age 73, the House of Commons is to sacrifice its independence? He forone would not faU down before the brazen image. (Great cheering.) With regard to the present members for Manchester, he said it was the electors of Manchester, and not they, who were on their trial before the country. If they -anted to exchange the proud distinction they enjoyed of having two men to represent them who could grapple with other men in that great arena of intellectual gladiatorshiD the Hoose of Commons, and enable Manchester, at Eli events, to count as something in the eyes of the world, let them keep their p resent members. If, on the other band, they thought they had acquired fame and distinction enouh and wanted to fall into utter insignificance, and to hear aUSleS of scorn and indignation, then let them return the two men who were the new candidates fortheirsuffra7es. (Great cheering and es.citement.)
MORPETH.-The Secretary of State for the Home Departmnent (Sir G. Grey) has just issued an address to his constituents, soliiting a renewal of the trust they reposed in him in 1853, when they elected him as their representative, after his defeat in the previous year in the contest for North Nortiumberland which, as will be remembered.
-as ocoasioned by a Coris-,vtiVe coalition formed to oust him from the representation, and supported by the territorial influence of most of the great landed proprietors in that part of the county. On that occasion, as in former years, wrhen thry sent a Huscisson, a Granvilie, and the p1 esent Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland to represent them in the Senate, the electors of Morpeth, it must be admitted, did something to purge themselves of t,he opprobrium of constituting a close borough. The following is the address of the right hon. baronet:
"As an early dissolution of Parliament is expected, I bAve the honourtoinform you that It ib my intention to solcit atyourbands

Tors (NOxtvH).-It is not certain w/hether Lord IL Ben miek w.ill again offer himsself. Lord Robert Clinton is again inthefield, and has issued an address, in which he repuc-
diaes the idea of wishing to Upset the Gorernment by his VOt on the China question.
RELDING.-Addresseg to this constituency have just been isgued by Mr. Francis Pigott and Mr. H. S. Keating, Q.C., soliciting re-election. Mr. Pigott, speaking of the Chinese question, says,-
" I deeply regret the lamentabl ocecanrrnces whicb have so recetly taken plae at Cinton, and sincoroly lament thAt onrclell and militsry authorities adopted such extreme measre The question reoently submitted to Parliament on that subject Involved great diMity, anCd caused Me constrdrable doubt as to the couree wbich it was my duty to puraee on the division in the House of Commone; but alter matur reflecton I daetermined to giro my Tote in support of Lord PAlmerston's Goveraiment, thinking on the whole that tbis Was the best coure and least likely to cause embarrassment. I am stilt an advocate for the progress of administrative reform, for the extension of the suffrage, the ProtectIon of the voter from undue nuenenco in the exercise of Isis franchise, and for every poesible retrenchment inthe publicexpeniture. My opinionsonothe subject of the incomo tas are in uneton with your own as expressed in yoar petition, vhlch I recently presented to the House or Commons,"
Mr.Kesateing, Q,C. adverting to the leading topic of the
"To sse Corermnent orfLord Palmerston, from Its formation, I haro given a general, but independent sipport, beieving tbat course, 5nderantheeirearcstsnes, best adaptedto the furtherance of the Liberal eanee amd of our national well-being. I regretted mucb, on the recent dieusosiou, that I was unable, after an anxionus tudy of the volumninous Papers laid before Parliament, to concur with the Gwermment In giving to proceedings at Canton an unqualided aD' prova!; but I declned to record my Tote against the Govemment, because lwouldnot give any conntenance whatever to a coilition, of the nature and objects cf whieh I wholly disapproved,"
Mr. Keating expresses hie satisfaction at the determination of Government to send a plenipotentiary to China, and truasts that this measure will bave the effect of placing our relations with that empire on auch a footing as to prevent a recurrence of disputes. Ho then proceeds to say,-
" I entertain the strong hope that the coming elections wmT give to tbe Ltberal cause in the House ot Commo ns that increaeed strength so neeuesary to accomplish the mnany impor tant reforms-asoial, political and administrative-which have been so long delayed amid the din of war cud contentious of party. I hops a *', that an early termination of ttie war with China will enable the newParliament to setabout tbework of reducing our national exp enditure and our nE tional taxation, and that it may thenenter upon a C aceer of progress, improving trade, extending commerce, and addiug to the scii happiness of the nation.,
There are rumours of an opposition, but whether there Wi be any nothing is yet definitely known.
RrPol.-The electors of this borough have been taken greatly by surprise at the nne tected annoancement issued by Mr. W. Beckett and the on. Edwin Laseelles, the present Conservative members, that it is their intention to retre from the representation of the borough. A meeting of inuential Liberal electors has been held, Captain Smith in the ehair, at which it was agreed to invite Mr. John A. Warre, of 64, Lowndes-square, London; and Mr. John Grdeenwood, of Swarehffe-hall, near Ripley, to become can-
SomisET (BAsT).-Mr. W. Miles and Mr. W. F. Knatehbull, the present members, have just issued their addresses. Mr. Miles finds it unnecessary, from his long conuexion wvith the CouDty, to repeat his political creed, but adds an explanahion of- his vote on the China question. MIr. Knatehbulc trusts the course he has pursued has given satisfaction to the majority of his constituents, but makes this admission,-
"I cau conceive that my vote in support of the resolutlon which eaused tbe approaching dissolution may not be approved of br some of the electors but I can sincerely say thst I never gave avotewith more readiness, oronemore in a&cord ance with my own conscience, for I believethe war in China to have been unjustly commencedand carried ounwith greattrseverity than the insult, if any were committed, warranted,
Soan3sntSE T WEST).-In an addre as soliciting re-election just issued by Mlr. C. A. Moody, the hon. member'says,-
" I could not by my vote sanction that extraordinary combisation of parties by vhich an attempr was nmdoeto break up the present Government, when there was no prospect of formsing another which could bhae carried on the business of the country. The coalition which the public papers had announced, whether really intended or not, was one of parties whtch had been virulently oppoeud to each other for the last 10 ;ears, and among 'whicb thera still existed subjects of difference which must have prevented any harmonious action. I fel it my duty, therefore, not in any way to contribete towards much an tuiom It 'would have ended in confuslon and an embarrasment of publie affairw
SOuTnwSARK.-Mr. Apsley Pellatt has retired from the eontest and has addressed a farewei to his constituents, in which he says,- -
" Since I ast had the honour of saddressing you another candidate has appeared, and, not desiidng to incur the enormous expenses which occaeonaUy attend contests in msetropolitan boroughs (as recently in Alarylebone), I respectfully withdraw my claim to represent Southwark in the approaching Parliament. Few members, comparatively during so short a Parlamentary career, have attended more divisions. haveortinatedmoreuseulBills, norpassed more practicallyuseful acts of Parliament than myself, and fewr members, at annual meetings Ind on other numerous ocasxions, have reeeived more gratifying testimonials of approbation."
A requisition is being got up calling upon the hon. gentleman to reconsiderhis decision.
STOKE-UPO-TP.ET.-The two sitting members have presented themselves for re-election, and have issued addresses to their constituents. Mr. J. L. Ricardo voted with the majority, and his colleague, the Hon. F. L. Gower, with the Goverqment. The former gentleman has given great offence to some of his best and most influential supportirs, who would not be sorry to get rid of him. Mr. Alderman Copeland has issued an address to the electors in which he states that he is wvilling to sit in Parliament if they choose to return him, but he wDI not canvass the electors.
STmOUrD.-The threatened opposition by the Conservatives has dwindled into nothing. A notice appeared on Friday night stating that Mr. Pownall, the chairman of the Middlesex Qurter t&essions-a gentleman of Conservative principles-would issue an address to the electors on the following day. No address, however, appeared, and on Tuesday Mr. Pownall withdrew his claims on the ground of "ill health and declining years." The Liberal party are by no means united; and, notwzithstandiing the assurances given at the public meeting on Thursdaylevenisg that there was no spUit in their camp, an address wvas issued on Tuesday evening by Mr. George H[. Bengough, of the Ridge, Wottonr,nder lEde, an extreme Liberal, on anti-MIinisteri3l principles, ne says:
"Had almost any'other question been now before tee country, or even had eAher of your present representatives taken diferest viewa on that queation, I should searcely have ventured to intrude myself upon Your notice. I do so now, and come before you an a canidats for thc representation of the borough, because Isncerely hope th l:tneithbr - 5e country at large nor the electora of Stroud will doliltlrately co-brlnm Lord Palmerston in sanctioning tle recent proceed ing, to China; nor, on the other hand, allow any but A really Lti- it AdminZstration to succeed him, The measurea at Canton, ,-: cXregard as3both inexpedient aud moraly wrong, are only toa r eh In accordance with other acts of hasty agegron and the worst
nsuble (because fruitless) intervention whiechhave been toofrequent in Lord Palmerston's foreign poLlcy,-acts wholy inconsistent with the true bonour and greatness of this comntxy and with any diminution of those burdens which aitmpress on its industry aud cemrmerce and which, if persisted in, maust prevent any near prospect of income-tax repeal."
He declares himself to be in favour of a progressive extension of the franchise, of the balot, of the abolition of churchrates, and of the spread of religious education; and expresses himself opposed to the income-tax. Mr. Bengough is well known as one of the originators of the reformatory schools, and the manager, in conjunction with Mr. Baker, of the Hardwicke Raformatory. If the election should be contested it will in aU probability be a sharp one, as the constituency comprises a large number of Radicals. In order not to rosk the return of a Conservative candidate, who might probably be brought forward with a ebance of suoeasif thelLIberals continued divided, Mr. Bengough concludes his address by saying:-
1" It Iflid that my coming forward in oppesition to the sitting members onuthe present occasion isnlikely to open the way to the return of a fromn thedcontes"g las bbeal e I shal feel tit my duty to witbdraw
TIvimTOy.-Mr. Heathroat, in an address to the electors, says,-
"Under ordinary circumstances I might hale been incUned to retire from the representation of your borough, and should have felt a pride inurestoringitoyou (I hope untmrnished) the trust you gave into my keeping upon the passing of the Reform Bill;h bt I feel that the Dresent crisis caslafor the exertions of every man who values the position of his country among the nations of the world. Aooording to my views, the present Government of the country deserves the support of every true patriot; and after having voted on the 3id of the minority in the late division in tte House of Commous, Iam desrous of having my opinion upo0nthe ea:questionof the day confirmed byyou, and in thin hope again oli-r myself a a candidate for your suifrages."
The statement that MIr.Heatconat Ainory meant to stand for this borough is incorect; and £sir J. H. MaxweeU has
WARWICY-This borough is being actively canv&ssed by Sir Charles Douglas, formerly a member for Warwick, but who was discarded owing to his pursuance of a free-trade poliy; AMr. Smith, in behalf of Mr. Greaves M?. who is on the Continent, but expected home every hour; "and r. Repton, M.P., who is supported by the "Castle interest." Thegeneral belief is that Sir Charles and Mr. Greaves will be the succe&sful candidates, but they have not yet publicly addressed the electors. Sir Charles Douglas says in his address-
" Sinc ! lsat baa the honour of addrclg you, thit wunty7 has been engaged in a great war, which, under Lord Palerssou. Ad ministration, bas been, at an earler period than many anticipated, bonowably terminated. He has alrepay reduced EAooo,oO of the

eadent suDpOtt, instuing a fair trial, should be giTen by the new PalSamentSo his Govermant."
Mr. Repton in his address says
"Opinion may differ upon the subject of theChinse war, and. having cweleY read the papers preseuted X oonsIentiouey came to
thb conclusion that the conduct of Sir Johb.owing was decIing ot oenmr, but nOw I feel the tineD is gone Ig SnD disassiLg the Dneessity Of the war; vigorous measures a,, now necessary, and every aSIstance should be gilen tobringUb conteetfoan onorablan speedy oncluJion.
WAssWICI;See (SO T4-Vr. Bolton King, formerly a representative of the boroagl of Warwick, has become a candidate for this divsioun, of b Wcunty, and has issued an address to the electws, Mr. King, in his address,

We have since heard that Lord Guernsev bas resigned, and it is not yet settled whether Lord Vllhiers or the Hon.
Edward Leig will solicit the suffrages of the electors in his room; but there is little doubt Jr. King will not be stiffered quietly to walk over the courso.
WXST31MoItIrL.ND.-The .:arl of Bective and the Hon. Colonel Lowther have again oflered themselves as candidates for this county, and will probably be returned without opposition. Colonel Lowther, who has represented Westmoreland for a ntmber ofyesars, Says,-
" I have seen nothing to make meowaver in the prinolpleswhich from the firt I hare profesed. It I am agait returned to Parliament, I sbaUdees it to be my duty to upholdtbeCiurch and rbe Throne in their old authority, and to the best of my ability to maintain the honour of the countryatroad and her prosperity at home."
WORCESTERSiIIRE (ASIT).-The Hon. Colonel Rushout and Mr. J. H. H. Foley, the sitting members, issued their addresses soliciting re-election yesterda7. Both are in general terms. Colonel Rushout says sis principles remain the same as when he first addressed them.-a firm adherence to our Protestant Constitution, &c.;* and he is for the correc-
tion of abuses "proved by the late war to have existed in our mflitarr *nd civil institutions," Mr. Foley says his political principles are too weU known to renire explana. tion, and he declares them to be unchanged. Ne opposition
WoncE,5T.9 .mE (WEST).-The addresses of the sitting members, Iord Elmley and Mr. W. Knight, were issued yesterday. Lord Elmley says: -
"The m3nre? In which Lord Palmerston conducted the var to a successful isweu no doubt merits the approbation ot the country; but this happy reonit was in a great degree owing to the oonduct of au parties in the House ot Commons, who never refused the demands of theh nnister for supplie3 to carry on the war. and I think you wfill be of oDUinon that the oonduct of the Cones rative party on that occasion fully exonerates them from the term I faction' so often and unwar-
rantably applied to them."
He is also for reconsidering our financial state, and is for "judicious retrenchment"inournaval and military establishments, withoutinmpairingtheirefficiency. He looksalsorwith hope to the extinction of the income-tax in 1560. Mr. Knight professes to hold Conservative principles, on which he was caUedZto represent the county some 16 years ago. He advocates the reform of many branches of our ecclesiastical, civil, and criminal laws, the revision of the administrative departments of the country, the state of our national education, of crime, and vagrancy, of the unemployed of the metropolis, the administration of our charities, &o., and he is opoosed to all attempts to transfer the independent administration of counties, boroughs, and parishles to tbe hands of the Home Minister, or his
inspectors and commissioneos.
YORKC (NORTH RDISGO).-The Hon. J. C. Dnrdas, brother to the Earl of Zetland, has during the past week addressed meetings of the electors at Thirsk and Northallerton, and on MNonday evening a large and influential meeting in the Odd Fellows' all, Middlesborough. The hon. gentleman, who has been induced to come forward as a candidate in the Liberal interest by a large section of the constituency who are dissatisfied wvith their present representative, Mr. Cayley, for having voted against Lord Palmerston's Government, has been very warmly received by the electors. At Mdddlesborough he censured severely the conduct of Parliament in coming so prematurely to a conclusion on the conduct of Sir John Bowring, and contended from the fact of Sir John Bowring being one of the most amiable of men and a worthymember of the Peace Society, that Parliament might have been satisfied he would not do anytbing rashly and must have had good cause for the steps he had taken. After alluding briefly to the able and statesmanlike manner in which Lord Palmerston had steered the nation through the difficulties and dangers of the late war crisis-a task from which the leaders of the other sections in the House shrunk-the hon. gentleman said he would go to Parliament unfettered by any pledge, but referred to his votes while in the Horse as member for the city of York in proof of what his opinions on general politics then were, and stated that his convictions had undergone no change.
SCOTL&2;D.
AnxRiDEs7lrREX.-Lord Haddo, in again soliciting the representation of the county, takes occasion to observe:-
" Mty votes in the Roa,e of commons harv never b-en littluenced
by any private or party feeling; they h aye een given in a Conservative piit, and with the view of preser ving unimpaired aU the great intere,ts of the Stste. The nation baving recently brought a sanguinary war to a suocessful termination. I could not approve the lato proceedings of our authorities in China, by which the country bad been again Involved In bostllitiex, to the serious Injuiry of commerce and the great losI of human life. without adequate motive, and in the absence of aU direct instractions from the Governmnent in England. At the samae time, I fully recognize the necemity of securing such a peaem as may place oir relations with the Chinese empire upon a basis lkely to be permanent."
CLACK3ANNAN AND KDNRoSs.-Mr. Johnstone, the present mcmber for these counties, whose vote against
overnnment on the Chinese question has rendered him somewhat unpopular, has, to avoid a contest, withdrawvn in favour of Viscount Milelgand. in whose principleshe expresses general concurrence. The Liberal party, being dissatisfied with 3fr. Johnstone, had first invited the Lord-Advocate, who, however, declined to leave the Leith burghs, and next Mr. Adam, wrho contested the counties with the present member in 1851, but who wvaved his clanims in favour of Lord Mselgund. On Monday the noble viscount met the electors at Alloa, Clackmamnsan, and Rincardine, and at each place resolutions were enthusiastically passed in his
DUDAR3BTONSHTlR.-MY Ssnollett has again addressed the eilectors of this county, for wfhich his return is all but
DuT3scysn.s.-~Considerahle dissatisfaction was felt by a number of the electors of the Dunmfries district of burghs on account of Mr. W. Ewvart not supporting Government on the China question, and these, joincd by others who dis-
lik te hon. member's political creed, haveobeenoendeavoroaisg to bring a competing candidate into the field. The Conservatives pitched UpO71 or. Carnthers, of Dormont, a
lned proprietor in the county; but he declined the honour, MIr. James Hannay, of London, but a native of Damfnies, author of Bi77glcto Fastener, and other literary p roductions, has, however, solicited
th sifralges of the electors, so that an opponent to Mlr. Ewauc has at length turned up. MIr. Hannay in his address puts great stress upon the right soluttion of social qustios, and seems from it to be a politician of the S,tanley class. Hre condemns the Chinese policy of Lord Palnierston, and, if returned for the Dum fries borghs, the anti-Ministerialirts would gain a vote. It is generally supposed that his chances of success are small, and that Mr.
Ewar will carry off the prize egainst ali comers.
El7IXBwI;R(, COU-Tr-)-The Earl of Dalkeith solicts re-election for his county. IIe says in his address that he felt it his eonscrentiors duty to suppo7rt the motion vvhich
has caused the dissolution, but that he did so from no factious motive and for no party purpose.
FALKIR}; BUItOHS.Mzr. Merry, the candidate who was recenatly rejected for Glasgow, has been invited by a portion of the Liberal electors to offer himself for these hurghs, in opposition to Mlr. George Baird, wvho stands upon the Conservative interest. It is untderstood that MIr. Ierry is, in consequence, about to issue his address,
GlRExxxcic.-Zfr. M. Dunlop visited this burgh on Monday, and intimated his final retirem7ent from the representation. He said he felt bound in honour not to enter into a contest with Sir Henry Rawlinson. The latter gentleman is accordingly in possession of the field in the meantime, hat a section of the electors speak of brinbing forward MIr. Jo'an Fame, of London, in opposition to Sir HenrS
KeacAi4tRXocT BUstoirS.-Mr. E. P. Bouverie has aain addressed the electors of these burghs, and there is no tliklihood of opposition, Mr. Bouverie says in his address, whic CIS dated London, March 16:

Knnx]CUDRssrsl(-lr..-There are now two candidates for the representation of the stewvartry of Kirkcudbright 3ir. George Maxwrell, of Glenlee, and lAl. J^Ame Maclcie, son of tbe retiring member. Both gentlemen are Lib,rals, and it is not an unhkely thing that, unless one of them withdraw, a Conservative may step an and defeat them both. Mr. Maxwell addressedamneoting of electors ae CaZstle Douglas^ on the
6t, sand met with a favourable reception. Heo explained his nvies respecting the parochDial schools, stating that he
tought it w,as unfair to render it imp erative that alU the teacers ahould be members of the established church. Ue
ataea also, in reply to a question, thathe would not vote in favour of any interference with the Maynooth endowment. It need scarcely be stated that this question of the parish schools is deemed a vital oae in Scotland, and that while Mr. Maxwell's declaration en the subject may gain hi= the support of Dissenters and "advanced" Liberals, it has a tendency to elicit opposition to him from the members of the established church, particularly if they be of Conservative politics.
PAISitI-.-Mr. ArciWbald Hastie lhas retired from the contest for this burgh, which he bas represented for upwards of 20 years. The atrsng determination of the electors for a change of some kind, and the great favour shown to Mr. IHumfrey Crum Ew3Dg, the new candidate, rendered Mr. Hastie's chances hepeless.

COLE1RAINi (BORoUcm).-Lord Naas has taken leave ofColeraine and the Irish constituencies generally. His Lordship had not the most remote chanco of being again elected. for the borongh, with Dr. Boyd for his opponent. The borough of Cockernouth will probably be Lord Nasa'a harbour of refuge.
KILKENNY (CITY).-Cnptain G. Kelsham is a candidate on the most ultra-Radical principles for the city of KElkenny.
Sil0O(BOROtICOH).-Candidatesforthiscelebratedborough are becomig as plentiful as blackberries. The last in the field is MIr. James O'Dowd, iun., a member of the Middle Temple. M9lr. O'Dowrd is a warm sepporter of the present Government, and there are some crcumstances connected with his eppearance as a candidate which foreshadow the probability of aclose race betw;cen him and whatever number of candidatesi may be arrayed against hina.
TIPPERAPTY (COUNsTY).-Alr. Waldron has declared his intention of again contesting the county of Tipperary, and it is said to be the intention of The O'Donoghue and Mfajor hlassy to stand together in opposition to him, upon.. the principles of tenant.-right and independent oppositoion Of the return of the two latter gentlemnen no doubt is entertained in well-informed qnarters by a much larger majority than The O'Donoghue had last week.
TYRONE.-We are requested to contradict a statement which appeared in our columns yesterday to the effect that Lord Claude Hamilton had retired, and that Sir Montagm J. Cholmeley had issued ank address to the electors.
WEXFOPD (BoPl'oUr.)-Mr. Devereux, the sitting member, is likely to exicounter a rather formidable opponent in the person of Captain Frederick Hughes, P.N., of Ely House, who has issued an address to the electors. The gallant officer's name is honourably associated with thelater events in the East.

EAsT LNDIA-IOUSE.-A Quarterly General Court of the East India Company was held yesterday, Mr. B. D.
Mlangles, Deputy-Chairman of the Court of Directors, in the, chair. Mr. Jones submitted a motion respecting the eonstitution of the Board of Control, and complained that theboard exercised p-n injurious influence over the affairs of India, although the members of the hoard had no experience whatever in the affairs of that country. The resolution moved by Mr. Jones was, "Tbat under the new Act by which Government appoints six directors to this Court the services of the six senior clerks at the Board of Control are unnecessary, and that the abolition of the offices held by them will save 20,0001. per annumn to the Indian revenue, and expedite and improve the home administration of India."
r. Lewin seconeed the resolu.ion, but explained that heonly did so to express his dissent from the views of the mover of it. The Chairman entered into an explanation of the powers of the Board of Control, defended that institution, and remarked that if tho board performed its high functions properly the sum which itwas proposed to save wax a mere trifle as a charge upon tke people of India. After some discussion the resolution was Degatived. A conversa. tion ensued respecting the rate of exceange between England and India, and after some other unhiportaLnt business the Court adjourned.

PARIS, MA&cu 17, 6 r.mr.
The answer of the King of Prussia to the last communication of the French Government has beea received. The terms are said to be pacific, and, what is not often the case, somewhat to the point. His Majesty was evidently in a benevolent humour when he wrote or dictated them. It would be hazardous to say what the next communication will be. The Conferences will, I presume, soon open again " for the despatch of business." The two Commissioners sent by the Canton of Neuchatel to Paris to assist Dr. Kern have been received by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
The members of the Senate, Legislative Corps, Council of State, &c., were admitted to the Tuileries last night, to present their congratulations on the happy event of the Prince Imperial having completed his first year yesterday. His little Bighneas is, as you are aware, inscribed on the muster-roll of the 1st Regiment of Grenadiers of the Guard, and tho men of that gallant corps have celebrated the auspicious event by banquets, accompanied by appropriate toasts. The public, who seemed to have forgotten all about the matter, were reminded of it by the flags hoisted on some public buildings. The Court tailor, also, who in matters of joyous demonstration is, next to the Grand Master of the Ceremonies himself, the most enlightened man in Paris, had given notes of preparation. For three evenings previously a stream of gaslights played round the shop-front for half-an-hour, and experimental flags fluttered over the doorway. The Moniteur of yesterday and to-day has several columns filled with promotions in the army and the Legion of Honour, and, what is still better, a number of poor children are received into the Orphan Asylum, which is under the patronage of the infant Prince, and which owves its foundation to the funds subscribed last year to offer a testimonial on the occasion of his birth. Among the promotions I do not see the name of the Prince; his Highness has no undue ambition, and he is content to remain some time longer in his present rank. Nothing is left undone to render the heir to the throne popular, and keep him present in the minds, if not m the hearts, of the people. It was supposed that the anniversary would be signalized by a pretty comprehensive creation of new nobility. The intention has been often attributed to His Majesty, and it is stiU said that he has not abandoned it altogether. In his more thoughtful moments he has perhaps recoiled from such a parody of the first Empire, never less opportune. The ice, however, hasbeen broken bythe Dukedom of Malakhoff, and there are many among the aspirants to nobility whose victories on the wellknown battle-field in the Rue Vivienne are considered by themselves as on a par with the Marshal's attacks on the Crimean stronghold. Duc du Grand Central, Marquis de la Bourse, and Comte de la Couiasse would surely sound as well as Duc de Bouillon, Comte du Trou-bonbon, and Baron de la Marmalade, and posterity would not makemuch difference betweenl a genuine aristocracy and the aidie. Few eyes detect at a distance the difference between paste and diamond. They who have set their hearts on patents of nobility, as well as on railroad concessions, may well be gratified by the one as they have been enriched by the other.
It would appear that some at Court have been much struck by the preamble to the treaty of amity and commerce lately concluded between France and Persia, and have taken the Oriental terms of compliment employed in it in a literal sense. " The elevation of His High Majesty the Emperor Napoleon," says the eloquent Persian, " is equal to that of the planet Saturn, whose standard is the sun ; he is the Ilminous star of the firmament of crowned heads-the sun of the heaven of Royaltythe ornament of the diadem-the splendour of standards and the Imperial ensigns," &c. M. Babinet, of the Institute, has rendered astronomy familiar, and, thanks to his exertions, there is now hardly a courtier who [is not aware that Saturn is accompanied by a certain number of satellites, who of course form his entoutrage. The parallel is complete.
Feruk Khan has turned the current of our ideas towards the East. Persian tastes and usages are getting into vogue. The Persian Envoy, courtly, hyperbolical, and clever as he is, does not, however, enjoy a monopoly of interest. It is shared by one who is sadly deficient in those qualities which recommend a courtier. For some Sundays past the preachings of the celebrated Father Ventura have roused the attention and deranged the equanimity of the Court. The reverend person preaches the Lent sermons at the Chapel of the Tnileries. Louis XIV. gave ample liberty to Bossuet to denounce the vices of the age, and to proclaim the hollowness of Court flatterers and the vanity of worldly pomp. Louis Napoleon could not do less, and the eloquent Dominican was given to understand that, if the tribune be silent, from the pulpit may yet be heard words of truth and solemn warning. The duty of Governments towards the people was the subject of the first discourse, and the select congregration could hardly believe their ears when they heard his strong condemnation of the system of Napoleon I. in the presence of his successor. The unbounded and selfish ambition, the disregard of the obligations of a ruler, and the incalculable disasters his system brought on the milions under his sway, were set forth. It was anmusing to witness the astonishment of the ladies and gentlemen in attendance at the audacity of the preacher. Their features turned every colour of the rainbow, and glances were furtively cast at the Emperor. He, however, betrayed no emotion; he listened throughout with the same calmness as if the sermon was but a strain of eulogy. The preacher at last relieved the apprehensions of the attendantB by retuning thanks to Heaven that France had now a ruler whose policy was of a different character, &c. The second sermon related to the education of the people, and the reverend father dealt some hard blows at the University. The discourse of last Sunday was particularly effective. It dwelt on the absolute necessity the ruler of a State is under, not only of setting a good example in his own person to the people, but of enforcing morality in those who are employed by him in affalrs of State, or at least of preventuig such as may have been known for habitual disregard of all that makes life respectable and respected from being the agents of his power. He dwelt on this topic, it appears, at some length, and seemed to be acquainted with certain particulars not over reputable relating to some brilliant personages, which have run the round of the Parisiau salons for the last month or two. It is to the credit of the Emperor that Father Ventura continues to preach. The congregation is small and necessarily select, and it is doubtful whether such sermons would be allowed in the more thronged churches of the Madeleine, St. Sulpice, St.Eustache, orNotre Dame. It is to be hoped he will still wield the scourge. The poor are often enough reminded of their omissions and commissionz, but the profitable misdeeds of brilliant and tolerated sinners, the scandal of our times, require a courageous and unsparing hand. The sermons of Father Ventura will probably be continued; they will form a Petit Carime not less necessary now than in the time of Massillon.
It is currently reported that the Emperor is about to send several Councillors of State and members of the Senate into the departments of France with a commission to examine and report on the real situation of the country, in the same manner as M. Fould, the Minister of State, examined and reported on the state of the southern departments.

BANKING IN TURKEY.
CONSTANTINOPLE, MAAOH 6.
The proposed convention for the establishment of an Imperial and National Bank in Turkey, after having undergone important modifications in the comnussion appointed to examine it, has finally received the sanction of the Council of Ministers.
Mr. Wilkins has also, on behalf of his principals, accepted the alterations of the Government. The ratification of His Majesty the Sultan has probably been already obtained, and the Imperial firman wilt soon be on its way to London. The preliminaries of this important affair are so far settled; it now remains to be seen what resources for carrying it out can be obtained from the moneyed classes of England and the Continent. There doe3 not seem to be much to find fault with in the contract which has been entered into, and there is no doubt that if they are fulfilled with common honesty and fairness on both sides the Ottoman Empire will acquire a valuable institution and a powerful instrument of financial reform, and the founders and shareholders a profitable investment for their energy, intelligence, and money. The following are the principal provisions of the contract:-
The Government of His Imperial Majesty grants to Messrs. - the privilege of creating a State bank in the Ottoman Empire, and of forming for that purpose a company, and raising the necessary capital by the subscription of shares. The bank is to be styled " The Bank of Turkey," and to be under the high supervision of His Majesty the Sultan, so that the principles of the concession and the general laws of the empire be maintained. The [privilege is granted for 30 years, and one year before
the expiration of that term the Imperial Government may announce its intention of dissolving the bank, by paying up at the end of the concession all the sums it may owe to the bank, either in capital or interest. The bank binds itself also to withdraw all its bank-notes and pay off all its debts. The head establishment of the bank will be in Constantinople, but it will have the privilege of forming branches and agencies in all parts of the empire. The bank will have the right to perform all sorts of banking operations, and chiefly discounts, and advances on all sorts of securities; to buy and sell biDls of exchange, and issue bank post-bills on the system of the Bank of E:ngland. The Direction of the bank will be In Constantinople, and consist of a governor, namned by Government, a deputy-governor, and 24 directors, 12 of whom wiUl also be named by Governent and 12 by the founders for the first three years, and after that period by the votes of the shareholders. The details of administration have been left open, and will be settled by a subsequent agreement between the Government and the founders. Thebank will publish a weekly statement in the local and London papers, and its accounts will be examined and clividen cleclared every six months. The capital of the bank will be 10,000,0001. sterling, with the obligation of increasing it, if required, and it will be divided into 500.000shares of 201. each, and subscriptions will be opened, at the same time and on the same conditions, in France and Germany, to allow those countries to subscribe for an equal amount. The bank wiU commence operations as soon as all these shares shall have been subscribed, and 25 per cent. at least of their amount paid up in specie into the coffers of the bank. The remainder of the capital to be caUed up, as it may be required, on the decision of the governor in council. The gold coin of 100 piastres known as the Medjidie wil become the standard of the monetary system of the empire, and this standard will be irrevocably recognized by the Government and maintained at par by the bank. The bank will have the exclusive privilege of Issuing bank-notes, which will be received as a legal tender in all parts of the empire by al Government officers in payment of Government dues. These bank-notes will be payable to bearer on demand at the offices of the bank in Constantinople, and at its branches and agencies throughout the empire, between the hours of 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. every day, Sundays excepted. The bank will always be obliged to have in its coffers, in specie or ingots, as a reserve, a sum amounting to at least half its bank-notes in circulation, and the circulation of bank-notes is never to exceed the maximum of 15,000,0001. sterling. The bank will at all times have the right to send to the Mint specie or ingots to be converted into Turkish coin on its account, free of expense. The bank will withdraw at par all the paper money in circulation, first the schims and caiuns bearing interest, and afterwards the caim6 without interest, so that the whole shal be withdrawn 15 months after the opening of the bank. The paper money as it is withdrawn shall be destroyed in presence of commissioners appointed by the Government, and for each amount of paper withdrawn at par the Government will hand over to the bank Treasury bonds, in coupons of from 201. to 1,0001., bearing interest at 6 per cent. per annum, which Treasury bonds the bank wil have the right to dispose of as best it Dleases. The Government will immediately make a special assignment of a certain portion of the public revenue (that of Moldavia and Wallachia, of the island of Crete, and of the customs of Constantinople) to the bank, to be appropriated by the bank to the pavment of the interest of the Treasury bonds, and to their gradual extinction. The Government binds itself not to issue any kind of paper money or of notes, nor to grant or allow the exercise of any such privilege in the empire to any person or company, during the existence of the bank's privege. When aU the paper money shaU have been withdrawn the bank will also effect the withdrawal of the beehliks alteleks, and their subdivisions, this operation to be completed in two years from its commencement. The coins withdrawn will be melted and assayed to ascertain their real value, and immediately converted into new coins, subdivisions of the legal standard (of which the title will be hereafter determined), and paid in to the bank without delay. The bank having previously debited the Government with the amount paid to withdraw the coins at par will now credit it for the amount paid back in new coin, and for the balance it will receive from the Government Treasury bonds, bearing interest at 6 per cent. per annum, precisely similar in every respect to those issued for the -withdrawal of the paper money. The bank wiUl pay no taxes, and will receive every protection requisite to its offices, notes, or property from the Government. The Government will enact new and effieacious laws regulating the punctual payment of debts and bills of exchange. The bank, like the public banks of
Europe, wil be intrusted with all the receipts and' payments of the Government, and will keep a I separate account of al these transactions, and for any temporary advances it may make to the Government in anticipation of the revenues it will receive Treasury bonds payable at from 30 to 90 days, at the option of the bank, and bearing interest at 6 per cent. On the reception of the Imperial firman the founders wil deposit with the Turkish Ambassador in London 200,0001. as a guarantee for the due ful. filment of their engagements, and this sum will be forfeited in the event of the bank not coming into operation within six months from that date. The Government wiiU grant to the bank the land required for building suitable offices.
In the original form of convention the supreme direction of the bank was vested in a committee sitting in London, and composed in such a way as to insure at all times a majority to the English shareholders; and the directors in Constantiople were obliged to refer anything of importance to tbis committee. Such an arrangement was evidently vicious, and Redschid Pasha would not in any way I consent to it. He insisted on the direction being
entirely in Constantinople, and it was necessary to yield to him. He also required as large a specie reserve as one-half of the bank-notes in circulation the original provision being only for one-third, and fixed at 15,000,0001. sterling the maximum of banknotes ever to be issued, whatever be the amount of paid-up capital, and obliged the bank to pay its notes at the branches as well as at the central establishment.
That there is an unlimited field of operation open to an institution of this kind in Turkey is clear, and by the privileges conceded great care is taken to exclude the possibility of any competition. All the financial affairs of the Government wiU henceforth pass tbrough the bank, and there is no doubt that the Governmeut will gain by such an arrangement. One of the g.eatest sources of deficit in the revenue has hitherto been the ruinous loans at usurious interest, which every department of the Administration was obliged to contract several times a-year in anticipation of the revenues to meet presing calls. These loans will no longer be requird, as the Government will obtain from the
bank all necessary advnces at a reasonable rate, and the bank will have every security, as it will repay itself out of the revenue passing through its hands. The revenue, properly collected under the supervision of the bank, will be found to increase rapidly; for at present it is wel known that only a small portion of what is actuallypaid by the country finds its way into the coffers of the State. The receipts and expenditure already are equal on paper; when these causes of deficiency shall have been removed, instead of a deficit at the end of the year a surplus wiU be found, and the effect on the credit of the Governmentmmustbe immediate. Asforthe monetary reform whichthebank is calledupon to perform in the first instance, divided as it has been into several distinct operations and extended over a period of several years, there can be no difficulty in effecting it. The Six per Cent. Treasury Bonds which will be issued against the advances of the bank for this operation, being well secured, both as regards capital and interest, on distinct and clear portions of the revenue, will certainly become a favourite investment both in Turkey and elsewhere, especially when some improvement shall have taken place in the money-market and discount has fallen to 5 or 4 per cent. The bank willreceive them at par, and issue them, moat probably, at a premium.
THE STATE OF NALPLES.
(FROM OUR OWN CO:RESPONDENL)
NAPLES, MAIcnC 12.
In the month of November last you were informed that, the Duke di Serra di Falco had received permission to return to Sicily. For some reason or other, however, he did not enter the kingdom until last Tuesday, when he came into port by the steamer Amalfi. As he has not been permitted to land to kiss His Majestys hand, as was his desire, he has remained on board and will leave probably for Sicily to-day. The duke never was heart and soul engaged in the revolution, and therefore this tardy act of mercy is no great concession. Another act of mercyis that a father hasreceived permission to kiss and embrace his children and his wife. Hitherto the custom at Montesarchio has been for visitors to remain about 10 feet distant from the prisoners, with an iron grating between them. Nicolo Nisco in the month of November, I am told, solicited permission to kiss and embrace his children. At first the privilege was refused, but within the last fortnight it has been granted, and at the next visit Madame Nisco and her children are to be permitted the long wished-for favour. What must be the spirit of that Government which has required four months to obtain a privilege such as this !
TheAustrian-Lombardyamnestyhasneveryetbcen published in the officialjournal, though General Martini is saidtohaveremonstrated with Signor Carafaon the subject three several times. The answer has been that there could be no obligation to do so. Last night, however, the Imperial ordinance of Feb. 9, 1857, for the introduction of a new system of passports, was published. The Bilancia, of Milan, a Government paper, has a strong article against Naples, on the subject of the non-publication of the amnesty. In fact, this Government wil not take the slightest step which would indicate the appearance of relenting, or changing, what it caUs its attitude of firmness. Many of the prisoners declared free by the terms of the recent amnesty have been transferred, I am informed, from their several place of confinement to the prison of Santa JIari Apparente, with what motive I do not know.
A considerable number of raw Swiss recruits arrived here last week, and increasing efforts are made to render the Government. independent of native troops. This is not a step in advance, and the only effect of it will be to strengthen the hostile attitude which has been assumed by His Majesty and to render the present ruinous system more possible.
From Sicly I have the following inteligonce
Some time has elapsed since a comedy caled Pasqino was performed at Messina, in the course of which a soldier is represented as killing his general. The act was received with great applause by many present, and there was so much significancy in the demonstration that news of it was telegraphed to Naples. Orders were sent down immediately to in stitute a procds against the revisor and 30 of the appl-uders, and within the last 10 days or so the former, together with a number of others, has been sent off to the Island of Favignano.
In his speech on the China question I observed that Mr. Cobden says,-
"While our exports are going on increasing, more and more of our foreign trade is camed on through foreigners. Go to the Mediterranean or the Levant, to the ancient seats of commercial activity, and you will find that the English merchant, with au his probity, cannot claim an equality with the merchants of other nations.",
It is the connexion in which this passage is found, and the implied conclusions derived from it, that are calculated to render it very offensive. The facts are true; the conclusions wrong as regards Naples. The number of British merchants has been diminishing here for some time, and now there are not more than eight English houses in the capital, though the French have greatly increased. Nay, more, the ships arrived here last year under the British flag with a tonnage of not less than 49,875 tons, not more than five of the consignees were English; the others being either foreigners or natives. So much for the fact, now for the causes. The Neapoitans, who for some time were under a British pupillage, have learnt their lesson well, and now treat directly with England. Railways, steamers, telegraph and postal arrangements have increased the facilities of communication, and no one dreams of doing through a foreign agent what he can do so well himself. Admitting, then, so far that the British and Neapolitan merchant stand on equal ground, the Neapolitan will always have the advantage in his own country; for one reason among others, that the probity and highmindedness of the Englishman will not permit him to adopt the system of trade which is adopted here. That system is founded upon smuggling, deception, and trickery of every kind, and consequently the British merchant who will not (and, as a rule, such is the case) act upon this system must be undersold. It is notoriously so in Naples, where smuggling is carried on to a most shameless extent, and false papers may be obtained for a song, if all I hear continually be true; and it is to the honour of the British merchant that his class is a decaying, body in this country. Mr. Cobden's argument would go to impute it as a fault, whereas the fact which he states and regrets, as far as this country is concerned, is to be attributed to the force of social progress and of that probity of character which distinguishes the Englishman a3 much abroad as at home.

(FRM OUR OWN COnnESrONDET.)
MADRID, MARcH 13.
The repression of Absolutist tendencies in Court and Cabinet-a consequence of Royal misgiving,s as to the safetyof a retrograde policy-would have been very agreeable to the present Premier if he could have checked the reaction at the point he desired. But it is easier to set a ball rolling than to determine the point where it shall stop. MarshalNarvaez may be considered the last resort of Constitutionalism. After him we come to the Absolutists, who play the game of the Carlists, and to the PolacJs, who play nobody's game but their own, and represent nothing but the most profound political
-rpo Withdrawi4 g in alarm from the pe -
rilous cajolery of the Absolutist party, the Queen, instead of holding fast by Narvaez, has stepped a little ahead of -him, and now stands apparently wavering between him and that political party, or
rather clique, which, at least in profession, is a shade more liberal, and of which O'Donnell and
Concha are among the chief representatives. The situation of Narvaez is at this moment critical, and he feels it to be so. The Queen makes no secret of her small esteem for him, and scarcely a day passes that she does not express it to her intimates, through whom it oozes out, and has become matter of common conversation in the clubs and tertulias of Madrid. The partisans of
the present Government scarcely attempt to con-
ceal their doubts of its stability, and some *.f them have been heard openly to declare their
uneasiness, and their belief that the country is on
the eve of anarchy. Narvaez well aware of the unfavourable sentiments entertained towards him n
the highest quarter, would be glad to forestall the
gathering storm, and secure hmself an agreeab!e retreat. His eyes, there anbe littledoubt, of ten turn wistfully towards Paris, but it is difficult to make all secure for his ends in a country where, if
there be honour among thieves, there is litte among politicians. He would like, it is thought, to
abdicate the Premiership in favour of Senor Pidal, whom he thinks he could trust to maintain him
in the Paris Embassy. But it has now become I
almost an axiom in. Spain that every Cabinet maust have its General, and who is the G}eneral whom Warvaez could trustt Concha has been 'named, but Don Ramnon probably feels pretty onrtain that, with him im power, his appointment as Ambassador0would run the risk of revocation almost before he had reached Paris, for the insincerity of Marshal Concha is almost as proverbial as the slownesm of Senor Pidal. While the present chief of the Government is thus tormented by misivinmgs and apprehensions, by the sarcasms of the palace and the doubts of his friends, the prospects of O'Donnell, or at least the chances of his attaining power, decidedly improve, the more so as there can be little doubt that French influence is exerted in his behalf,-if not by the Embassy here, through other channels less direct. There are persons who imagine that O'Donnell and his friends do not desire to take office at present, but prefer waiting until the Cortes assemble, when they hope to overthrow the Government by a vigorous opposition in the Senate. This is probably-a mistaken view of their real wishes. O'Donnel has to apprehend, when the Cortes meet, a seriex of most violent and damaging attacks, to which his past conduct has laid him completely open. Hlis numerous enemies will give him no quarter. The Polaco3 especially are whetting their weapons of offence, and not one of the many flaws in his armour wiU escape their thrusts. If he came into office he would avoid this, for then the Cories-those, at least, whose elections are now preparing -would probably never meet. Another questiOn is, whether he could maintain himself in power, a p posing him to have attained it. It would be hardily possible, with only his present supporters. But these are, at this time, coquetting with a section of the Progresista party, professedly without his knowledge, but, as some believe, with his full acquiescence. As regards his chances of becoming Prime Mfinister, there is one circumstance that would induce me to believe they are not bad. Certain persons, formerly most attentive to Narvaez, and one man in particular, who holds a high position and who is noted for the keenness of his scentfor the acuteness with which he discerns, sooner than anybody else, the earliest rays of a rising sun-have lately transferred their devotion to O'Donnell, and are in daily intercourse with him. To this indication considerable weight is here attached.
The journey of the Duke and Duchess de Montpensier,to Madrid, concerning which the papersa short time ago contained so many contradictory statements, was, there can be no doubt, on the very eve of taking place when it was suspended by a message from this capital. As it is known that the Queendesiredhersister svisit,andastheMontpensiers are persons whose movements have no political importance, people have been rather puzzled to account for the change of arrangement. Some incline to think that it was made in accordance with the wishes of the Emperor of the French, who took the opportunity of testing and proving his weight in the Spanish councils. If so, it was a mere superfluous exercise of power, for the Montpensiers are nullities in a political point of view, are unnoticed when they come here, and have no real popularity even in Seville, their habitual residence. The Duke has none of the qualities likely to win the hearts of Spaniards; and one defect, commonly attributed to him, would be sure to alienate their sympathies. He has the reputation of being avaricious, even to meanness. Numerous examples are cited of his mesquinze,ie, by which he has disgusted many persons who otherwise were well disposed towards him, for this is one of the last things to be pardoned by Spaniards, who would much rather see their Princes extravagant than close-fisted; and this is unquestionably one of the reasons why the Duke has so thoroughly failed in obtaining popularity among his wife's countrymen.
General Prim has been sentenced to sx months' imprisonment, but retains his rank in the army. His advocate, General Zabala, whose able defence (understood to have been drawn up by Senor Olozaga) made a great impression, went last night to the Queen to ask her to remit the sentence. No positive answer was given, and to-day opinions are divided as to what will be done. If Prim is pardoned it will be another mark of the declining influence of General Narvaez, who has not forgotten old enmities, and is his personal foe. Neither the offence nor the puDishment being of a degrading nature, there is nothing to prevent General Prim being elected to the Cortes; but of course, if imprisoned, he cannot take his seat, and this will be a gain to the Government, supposing these men to be still in power when the Cortes meet, of which some doubt exists in the minds of many.
The mail that was yesterday to sail from Cadiz for the Havannah took out full powers and instructions to General Concha with respect to Mexican affairs. Nevertheless, it is to-day reported that Concha is to be recalled. This appears improbable.
The corpse of Don Jose Manuel Quintana, who died here on the 11th inst. at the advanced age of 85, was conveyed this afternoon to the cemetery. Quintana was one of those domestic celebrities whose fame scarcely extends beyond the limits of his native land. He was notable as one of the political reformers of 1812, as a poet, and as a preceptor of the present Qneen. He was highly respected here, and his funeral was attended by a great number of persons, 'both on foot and in carriages, including all shades of tbhe Constitutional party. Senors Olozaga La Serna, and Aguirre and the Duke de Rivas were among the numerous ex-Ministers and persons of mark who followed the body.
The price of grain is rapidly faUing throughout Spain, in consequence of the large supplies received from abroad and of the prospect of a good harvest. Some of the speculators will be heavy losers. In the province of Palencia wheat has fallen from 88 to 66 reals Bread is getting cheaper in Madrid, but only slowly, bakers here, as elsewhere, recognizing the necessity of a rise mnuch sooner than the justice of a fall.
The number of vessels that entered Spanish ports (of the Peninsula) during the month of February was, according to the official statement, 2,981, together 254,041 tons. Of these 616 were foreign ships. The departures were 2,877, equal to 247,432 tons, and including 590 foreign vessels.
A great exhibition of Spanish agricultural produce is to take place at Madrid from the 24th of September to 4th of October next. Cattle, wine, grain, fruit, tobacco, sugar, farming implements, plans of rural constructions, everything, in short, connected with agriculture, are to be there exhibited.
The Three per Cents. were done at 39 60; ditto, Deferred, 25 70.

HOsPITAL FOR DISEASES OF THE CBEsT.-Yesterday evening the 9th anniversary festival of this admirable charity was held at the London Tavern, where upwards of 200 gentlemen sat down to a most excellent dinner, which was served in the usual comfortable style. Earl Granville presided, supported by the Right Hon. the Lord Mayor, Mr. Sheriff Keats, Dr. Livingstone, Mr. H. E. Garney, Mr. J. Dillon, &c. The usual formal toasts having been given and enthusiaRtically responded to, the noble chairnan gave the toast of the evening. urging the claims of tho charity in a most humorous and forcible appeaL His Lordship referred to the annual report of the charity, from which it appeared that the number of out-patients during the past year had been 5,687, or 953 more than during the previons 12 months. Of this Bumber there had been cured or reheved, 4,604; reported as dead, 40; and remaining under treatment, 1,043. The in-patients for the same period amounted to 242, of which number 50 had been discharged cured, 139 had been relieved, 18 had died, and 35 remained under treatment. The total number of patients treated since the opening of the hospital was 33,236, which showed the average weekly attendance of patients to be 812, giving an increase of 113 as compared with the previous year. The report also mentioned that the maintenance of the charity, as at present constituted, required a sam of nearly 4O0M0. per annum, while the current mcome from subscriptions was only 90L It therefore regretted to state that till the income was increased and all the liabilities upon the charity liquidated it was almost impossible to recommend any increase in the number of in-patients. The total receipts since last year were 5,8121., of which there had been expended 3,8M for current expenses, and 1,9991. in liquidation of outstanding claims on account of the building and furnishing of the hospital. The toast of "Success to the charity" wasmeat warmlyrespondedto, Mr. S. Gurneysubscribing 250 guineas; Mr. H. }B. Gurney, 250 nineas *and Overend, Gurney, and Co., 100 guineas. 1nie total sBbsCription amounted to 3,720L,, exclusive of legacies of 6771.

Tho hearing of this cause, which comes on upon four petitions and further directions, has occupied the Court durin the whole of yesterday and to-day. The testatorF who died in 1816, left all his property to trustees, to be divided into certain shares; a decree was made in 1820, and frora that period, in ConSequenCe of tho mode in which the proporty was devised and the lapse of time, tho matter has become extremely complicated, by proceedings in the suit, deaths, defaults, and transmisejon of interests, and contains nothing whhatever for publc notice.

Th THE rATTER OF FRYER-uAFTDALx v. ricQoUT.
The quesion in this case involved the liability of a trustee to make good moneys amounting to nearly iU20L4 which had been received and misppropriated by his co. trustee, he having joined in t le receipt. The sum in question aroee from the sale of leasehold propert belonging to the testator in the suit, the sale having been mnade by the defendant and two ethers who were named as executors and trustees of the wilL. The sale was mnade iA
their character of trustees, and not in that of exeeutors, and all ha jondi tercit given to the l?urchaser, It wafunad 3oihowever, by the chief clerk s certificate that the money had been actually received by the defaultinz trustee alone (now deceased), and that he had acted in the sale as the solicitor for himself and the other trustees. That certificato was made under the common decroe for anl account in the suit, which was a simple suit by summons under the new praotice, and now came on to be h
further consideration. don
Mr. DREWBY and Mr. S. JAts, for the plaintiff c n- tended that it was competent to charge the defendant with wilful default in not having taken care that the money was properly appropriated, or that, at all events, tho defaultin
stoohxng atedin the sale as the solicitor for imlf and the others, the receipt by him of the money must be rehgardehd as a receipt by all, he being in fact the agent of the others. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ aen o Mr. BAOGSAWE, jun., for the defendant, atguedthat there was no case for charging him with the receipt of the money, it being clearly not within the scope of a solidctor's authority to receive moneys in such a case. The receipt therefore by the defaulting trustee must be regarded as a receipt by him in his character of trustee, and not as sollcitor, and it was a well settled rule that trustees were not liable where they had only signed a receipt for the sake of conformity. As to wilfl default, that was out of the ques. tion, this being a mere ordinary summons, and no case there. fore made upon tho pleadings which the defendant had had an opportunity of meeting.
The VreE-CHANCELLon said that the rule as to wilful default was so wev settled that the plaintiffs contention as to this could not be sustained for a moment, the decree being a simple decree for an accomunt. The only question therefore was whether this money could be considered as having been actuaUy received by the defendant. In these cases a distinction was always made between trustees and executors in favour of the former, as to whom the law was thus laid down by Lord Eldon in the case of " Brice v. Stokes," 11 Yes., 324 :-" At law, where trustees join in a receipt, pri-md fecic aU are to be considered as having received the money, but it is competent to a trustee, and if he mneans to exonerate himself from the inference it is necessary for him, to show that the money acknowledged to have been received by all was, in fact, received by one, and that t.he other joined only for conformity." That was the case here for, although it had been said that tho defaulting trastee had received as solicitor and agent for the others, that had not been made out. The only wvay, therefore, for getting at the defendant would have been to raise and make out a case against him of wilful default for not getting in the money. But this had not been done. The suit was a simple administration summons, raising no issues, and under which nothing but the common account of moneys actually received by the defendant was directed. The defendant was entitled to say he had never received this money, and he could not be made liable for it.
StIFF V. CASSELL.
A decree for an injunction was taken in this case restraining the defendant, the proprietor of Cadscl' IUutstrtaed .Family Paper, from publishing any piratical iUustrations or letterpress taken from the London J.urna,4 of which the plaintiff is proprietor. The defendant's case was, that he had received inaccurate information from abroad from persons connected with a foreign jomnal, wbo had represented that the illustrations sent over were original, and not from any works in this country.
I Mr. Rolt and Mr. Smythe were for the plaintiff, and Mr. Willcock and Mr. Goren for the defendant.
GWYY V. DOUGHNEY.
This was a biUl by an equitable mortgagee for foreclosure or sale, and came on by way of motion for a decree, the mortgagor having been served, but not appearing.
31r. WELFORD, for the plaintiff, asked for the usual account and an immediate sale, under the 48th section of the Equity Jurisdiction Act.

(Before Mr. Commissioner Muapny. i
In this c9se an aPplication was made to appoint an assignee on a creditor's petftion. The insolvent, a married woman, was in custody in the prison of St. Thomas the Apostle, Devon.
Mr. WAY applied to snake the rale absolute, and Mr. CAA.TEN showed cause. The latter learned gentleoan said there was some difficalty in getting an attorney at the place to prepare a schedule,
Mr. Commissioner MURPHY was surprised to hear such a statement, and said, if it were so, the sooner it was altered the better. He should give the insolvent a month to file ler schedule, and if it was not filed he should grant the application to appoint an assignee.
IN RE LUKE JAM ALLEN.
1 his insolvent, who had been captain of a trading vessel, was opposed by Mr. Sargood for the detaining creditor, Williamx Read, a shipowner at Ipswioh.
In 1851 the insolvent sailed as captain of the ship Dazzler, and afterwards Mr. Read, the owner.sent out another captain, who seized the ship and sold it. Subsequently the insolvent came to England, and when he was about to sail as captain of another vessel he was arrested on a judge's order at Sanderland for an aleged debt of 7701. due to Mr. Read for freight. HE was arrested in February, 1855, and had been in prison 13 months. When he was about to be heard by the County Court at Darham he was removed by Read up to London by a writ uf 7 u cas corpUs, and he appeared to be heard in this court. There had been an arbitration about the alleged debt, but the time had expired
Mr. Commissioner MusrnY eventually adjourned the caso for the insolvent to file accounts respecting the vessel.

MIDDLESEX SESSIONS, Wcdncadaay, Mard, 1S.
(Bcfore Mr. PAsiraLY, Q. C., Assixtasn-udg)
William Culings, 40, was indicted for having unlawfuly procured, for the purpose of sale, certair obscene and filthy libels.
Mr. PoLand attended on behalf of the Society for the Sup. pression of Vice; the prisoner was undefended.
Wiliam Thorn, a police-constable, 75 F, said that on the night of Friday, the 27th of February, he was on duty in the Strand, and about 12 o'clock ho saw the prisoner at the pit entrance of the Lyceum Theatre with some printed bilUs in his hand, and as persons quitted the theatre he offered them for sale. He then took him into custody, and took from his hand some of the printed songs now produced, which were of a disgusting character. At the stationhouse he was searched, and several more songs ofa similar description were found in his possession. He offered one to the waiter at the publichouse close to the Lyceum, who refused to have anything to do with it, telling him to tako them away, as he knew all about them.
The jury found the prisoner GILilty, and sentence was deferred.
John Betts, butcher, of St. George's-place, Knightsbridge, surrendered to take his trial on an indictment, in which he was charged with having assaulted John Wise, a policeman, in the execution of his duty.
Mr. Sleigh appeared for tho prosecution, Mr. Powor wa; specially retained with Mr. Metealfe for the defence.
The prosecutor, 75 B, stated that about 1 o'clock on the morning of the 7th of February he wa3s on duty in Trevorsquare, Knightsbridge, when he saw the defendant, who was staggering drunk, talking to a woman at the corner of Charles-street. He halted when he came up to them, and the prisoner called him a - humbug, nd sid he had better be looking after his duty, instead of staring at hin Witness said he was doing his duty, and tld him not t interfere with him. The defendant then said ho paid rates by which - thieves like him were kept, and asked for his number. Witness said he was at liberty to take it, and he came towards him, as ho thought, for that purpose, bat he raised his fist and said he would knock his head off if ho did not movo on. Vitness said if ho struck him le should take him into custody, and he then struck him a blow over the eye. The woman and a man named Vick came up. He asked Vick to fetch a policeman, but le told him to let the defendxnt go and he would not interfere with or molest him again. fesprang his rattle, when Sergeant Graver came to his assistance. They each tookhim by thearm. The defendant said he did not know what he had done to be tal-en, and witness told him he had struck him over the eye. He then said he was a respectable tradesman, and was sorry, and they had better settlo it. The woman was tipsy. He did not in any way molest or strike the defendant. The pavement was very dirty and muddy that night, and when defendant was at the station there was no mud on his clothes. Defendant did not fall down.
In cross-examination he said he would swear he saw the defendant staggering, and he was talking quietly to the woman. Another woman passed, and also a man. Heo id not know the defendant, and did not use any offensiv eexpression. Betts did not say " If you repeat those w0es I will take your number." He came towards him as if to take bis nunber, when he struck him. He did not sayhe was a fine fellow to take a number or call him a vagabond. He did not threaten to give him a taste of his truncheon. The blow discoloured his eye; it was a little red and swollen next mDorning, but it wrent off in the course of the day. }' e sho vcd it to the magissto. Ho used no more force than was necessary to take him into custody. He had been
inpt e force nearly 11 years.
The police-sergeant wrho went to the proe4cnutor'a sit
'Ice corroborated his statement as to taking the defendant -into custoy. The woman with him was tipsy.
The sergeant who was on duty at the station when the obharge' was made stated that the defendant was disorderly drunk, and called the prosecutor had names. The charge of assault was made at the timne, and the defe-ndant treated it 'with indifference. He did notdeny it. Wise stated the circumstances then precisely ashe had to-day. His eye was swollen whenL the charge was maade. The woman was drLunk when she camue to the ztation.
This wvas the case for the prosecution.
Mr. Powxis, in his address to the juiry, said, he must confess that bis client Was in A position of conjsiderable peril, *which was increased by the circumastance of the witnesses against him being police-constables, who were as reguilarly trained to giv eidec as dogs were to hunt game, andl there was this difficulty, which would not arise in an action for assault, the defendant could not give his version of the transactionx in the wvitnessbox, hut merely by what his counsel could properly submit to the jury. He should not maake any indisenminate attack On the police as a body ; *the public were much indebted to them, huLt in this case there had been a wilful exaggeration to a tremiendous eX.tent on the part of the prosecutor, whose statement that the defendant was I"staggering" drunk was utterly faise. it was true that the de3fetndant on the night in question had been drinking - he had dined with his father-in-law, and on bis way homue Lie chanced to meet a young woman whomn he knew, and es he was about to bid her good night, 7near where she lived, 33, Trevor-square, the policeman Wise interfered, used language of the mnost impertinent and ,disgusting character-gross, indeed, to a degree-for which
1r. Betts threatened to take his number, when the constable seized him violently by the collar, and took him into custody on a charge of assaulting him. He sprang his rattle and got another constable to assist him. In the scuffle the policeman knocked his head against the railings, and that was all the injury he sustained. There was nothing to conceal inL the matter ; it was true that the defendant had 'been drinking to some extent, andathe woman he was speak. iii~ to was living under the protection ofa gentleman namied Clifton, but she had lived with him seven years, and was the mother of four childlren. There were, besides this woman, two independent witnesse of the transaction; they had not *been called on the p art of the prosecution, but they would be c1lld for the defonce ; they were entire strangers to
M Btts. ad one of them only came forward to say what he .sa and heard of the miatter after an account of the examination before the magistrate hadap .peared in the newspapers. The learned counsel forcibly urgedi that on comparing the evidence for the defence with that for the prosecution the jury must conclude in favour of the formier.
Mlargaret Clifton deoposed that she lived at 33, Trevor. square, and on the evening when this transaction occurred she mQet Mr. Betts by chance as he was going home. She -met him at the end of Sloane-street. Hle walked with her as far as the Trevor Armas publichoniso, where they had somethin to drink. After staying there some time they proceedle towards Trevor-square, and as the defendant was - bout to hid her good night the policemnan came nLp and made some observation which s)e could not now distinctly recollect. She saw a man standing close by, and the defendant was standing with his hack toward the railings. -The defenidankt said nothing to the policeman, but the latter said something he had no right to say. The policeman came up t him and pushed and shock him violently when he said he would have his number. M-r. Betts resentbed, and a scuffle ensued, but she could most positively swear that the defendant did not strike the constable. If he had she must have seen it. The soliceman knocked Mr. Betts's hat off, and she picked it up, and the policemnan then srang his rattle, and another camne up. She was a good dea confused. Tule defendant .was takeni to the stationhouse and she follovved. She was refused admission, and she then said that she was his sister, with no other motive thanx to get in and see what they charged Mr. Betts with, and if they mneant to lock him up. On find. ing what the eae was she went to the defendant's house and fetched his brother, and they went to the station together. It was a gross falsehood on the policemen's part to say that she was intoxicated. She had sutpped out at a friend's near 'Bbcomsbury-square, and had had a glass or two of wine. She partook of some gin and water with the defendant at the Trevor Arms.
In cross-examination the witness said she had tak-en no more than she should have done had she been at home. It was not a chamnpagne supper she had been to. She had not been to a theatre or any place of amusemient that night. She -went in a cab to the top of Sloane-street, where she met the defendant. It was a little past 12. Mr. Clifton had not been with her. She used to deal withi Mr. Betts when she lived in Brompton-road, and when the oliceman interfered she was speaking abouit an account .which she owed binm. She had known him four years She did nut know him pior to his miarriage. They were at the Trevor Arms
aulitte more than half an hour, and they then walked down ' the Brompton-road. On the following day she went to the police-court. She didi not hear the defendant ask the police what he -was being taken for and say that he had done nothing. She did not hear it ; she was some yards away *from them. She did not hear the policeman say, "Indeed
you have- on have struck mne in the eye." Defendant was holdigbythe railings -when the prosecutor sprang his trattle. Did not say then that the defendant haabeen struck andill-used by the police, hut he certainly was. She should have gone into the station, hut they shut the door in her face, and she then said ske was his sister. They then allowed her to go in.
Wiliamn Vick.-I am a coachman, and was formerly in ,the service of Mr. Edwars, a member of Parliament. I have been in the employ of Seager and Evavs, and am now with a job-master. I was present when this altercation took place. As I was going along Charles-street I hoard the policeman say something to somebody I could not then see. (He repeated the words they were of a most filthy description.)
I tpet see what it was ablout, and I saw the policemian, . Betts, and the last witness. Betts was about 30 yards perhaps from the policeman. Hle went towards him .and said, " If you repeat those words again, I will take yvour number." The policema-n said, "You are a pretty ''ellow to take my number. You 'are much more like a d- vagabond," and he repeated the word "1vagabond" several times. They got close together, and as M1r. Betts was looking at the numnber on his collar the policeman seized himn by the throat, and pushedl himi violently against the railings. They then camea to the ground. The defendant's collar was tomi off. I can swear that B3otts did not strike the policeman, and what fhe policeman did was quite uncalled for and uLnustifiable. I -uade a memorandum of the polic-eman's nuns-
rr,the defendant's name and address, the time and the place, and afterwards went to the defendant's and volunteered to give evidence of what I saw.
Nothing material was elicited from the witness in crossexamiination. He strictly adhered to the evidence above given.
George Isaac Norton.-I live at 24, Albion-street, Cabedonian-road, and am a commission agent. I was in Charles. street, Trevor-square, at the time in question. I have been a cabman, but the comimissioner stopped my badge through the misrepresentation of the police, but they never gave me the real reason, and I have done very well without it. I heard Mr. Betts say to the policeman, " Is it me you are spealding to ?" The policeman said, "1I'll soon let you know." I then stopped. The policeman was looking at the defendant, who said, "Shall you know me again ?" The policeman said, " I dare say I shall ; it is through such fellows ~as-you, lurking about with your womeon, that so many robberies are commiitted." Mr. Betts said, I"ed have you to know that I am very differenLt from that; I am a respectable tradesman." Thie policeman said, " Yes, you are a pretty sort of a tradesman to be out at 6his time of the morning." (The witness went on to repeat the observation spoken to by the latst witness.) Batts then said ho would take his nuxmber. The policemnan said, "IWhat, a vagabond like you take any one's nxumber l" and repeated "~vagabond" more than once.' The constable said, "II'll number you; you shall have a taste of this,"1 ptting his hand to hiz pocket where the truLncheon was.' He then thrust his fingers into his neckerchief and shook him. Betts slippedl down and the officer fell over him, and as he did so he knockedl his face agist the railings. A woman Wasing by cried "S hamne I" Tepliceman said, "Shame!
hat, do you know about same .h4f y ouainterfere you will soon be with him." He then hadl Betts in custody. I consider Mr. Betts was very much ill-used without provocation. I cdid not go to the station and say what I saw, because I was really afraid that they mnight also charge me. I saw a report of the case in the papers, and I then went dcown to the defenidant and told him I would be a6 witness for him. I never saw him or heard of him, that I know of, before.
Thomas Betts, brother of the defendant, deposed to his being fetchedl by the witness Clifton, who was quite sober at the time. The defendant was baild out at 6 o'clock in the morning.
Evidence was given that the defendant had always borne the character of a peaceable, well-conducted man.
M1r. SLEIGHi, ini his reply, contended that the evidence ff'r the defence had not shaken the case for the prosecution, anda that the result of an acquittal would he the ruin of thel 'policemen, who had always conducted themselves well in the force, for in effect they would be deemned to have maade
afalse charge and supported it by false evidence. On the other hand, the consequences of a conviction would be serious to the defendant, and the case altogether was one aemanaing the utmost attention and discrimination on tho part of the Jury'.
*The AssisTAiiT-JUD)GE having summed up,
The jury retired, aLnd after a abort consultation they found a verdict of Gulilty, adding that they considered the defendant had no vindictive fechug.
The AslsITANT-JuDGE said he regarded that addition to the verdict in the light of a recommendation to mercy, but tipon the verdict of the jwy the defendant had been guilty of assaulting a policeman in the execution of his duty-an offence for which the Court must pass a sentence. The defendant was a person of pecuniiary means, and the inliction upon such persons of a mere fine would be no punishment at all in a great majority of instances; but this was not a case for any extended term of imprisonment. No injury had been done to the policeman, and thejjury hadproperlyconsidered that the defendant had no vindictive feeling;* thathe had struck a policeman at a time when he wBS under the excitement of drink. The sentnce *as that the defendant pay a fine of 201., and be imprisoned one week.

he complainant said he was passing through Park-lane on the 10th inst. when he was suddenly knocked down by a blow on the body. The defendant, an entire stranger to him, was the person who committed the assault. When he got up he demanded of the defendant why he had strack nim. The defendant replied that he made it a rale to knock every man down who insulted him. He did nothing whatever to provoke the defendant, who ashe passed sprang upon him more like a wild beast than a man.
A professional entleman who was in court said he was acquainted with the defendant, who was in a highly respectable position, and he would put a question or two to the cointinant
Solicitor.-Did you not laugh at the defendant as he was coming towards you ?
Complainant.-I did not.
Solicitor.-Did you not smile at himr?
Complainant.-I did not. I do not recollect seeing the gentleman at all. I did nothing by word or by act that could bave attracted his attention.
The defendant, whose appearance and manner indicated great eccentricity, said he was going through Park-lane in one direction as the complainant was coming in the opposite direction. He noticed tbe defendant look at him and laugh.
oe saidto himself "What is the stupid feUowlaughingat?" The complainant laughed again, and, believing that it was intended for an insult to him, he certainly did give the complainant a push or blow as he passed him. With respect to the words attributed to him, he did not make use of them. The complainant followed him, and said he should give him into custody unless he obtained his address. He gave the complainant his address, expecting to hear no more about the affair.
Richard Goodall was in Park-lane at the time. He saw the comApianant coming along, looking as if he was buried in thought. The complainant did not laugh or smile. lHe did not see the blow, but he saw complainant getting up from the ground. and he heard two men in a cart tell the complainant to give the gentleman into custody.
The solicitor said, it was impossible to deny that an assault had been committed. the defendant must have laboured under some misapprehension at the time, and he did act in a way which could not be justified. The only circumstance in mitigation that he could offer was that the defendant gave his name and address when caUed upon to do so.
Mr. BmkDos said he should call upon the defendant to find two sureties in 201. each to keep the peace for three months.
The solicitor begged the magistrate to reconsider his judgment, as the providing sureties would necessitate an unpleasant exposure of the situation in which the defendant was now placed,
fr Bs oSt said, ast the case was entirely undefended, he could do no less than inflict the highes penalty-namely, 61,, including costs.
The money was paid.
WESTNiNSTzB.-William and Matilda Berringer, who pass as man and wife, were finally examined, charged with obtainig goods by means of forged orders.
The male prisoner had formerly lived as footman with MA. Soule, a Dissenting minister at Battersea, and consequently became acquainted with his tradespeople, The
auds were practised with such adroitness that the e.ercise of common caution was of but httle avail. There were three charges proved, the modus ope-randi being that the male prisoner manufactured such orders as the family were usually in the habit of sending to their tradesmen, requesting some articles to be sent for inspection. A portion was then returned as disapproved, a fresh order given, and the goods supplied to the bearer. In one case both the prisoners obtained property, in the others the woman only.
They vwere committed upon all the charges.
WO1HSr'P-sTREET.-Robert Kyle, a porter is the service of the Eastern Counties Railway Company, was charged with robbery.
It appeared from the statement of Inspector Teakle, of the railway polce, that for some time past complaints had been repeatedly made to the company by persons in the habit of transmitting goods by the trains, in some instauces that thein packages had been delvered much reduced in weight, and in others that their parcels had disappeared altogether. The company had therefore come to the determination to prosecute in every instance of detection, and, as it seemed pretty evident that these robberies were committed chie'ly at the goods-station in Brick-lane, orders were given to the officers on duty there to keep a sharp eye upon all the porters and servants as they left the premises, both at mealtimes and night. This has had the effect of cbecking the depredations in great part, but not altogether, and the prisoner, who had been only six months in the serviceand was suspectedbyWyman, econstable at one of the gates, of being concerned in the robberies, was about to go
ome at 10 on the preceding night, when one of his pockets was noticed to project in such a manner as to indicate his possession of something he ought not to have. Wyman insisted on searching him, which the prisoner resented, declaring he had nothing about him but his supper, but on the package being pued from his pocket it was found to consist of a handkerchief filled with loose tea, evidently stolen from one of a number of chests the prisoner had been engaged at the warehouses in loading upon one of the goods-trucks. The prisoner protested it was his own property, but could not tell the shop at which he had bought it, and the officer having had sense enough, before exposing the tea, to ask the prisoner the colour of it, which he described as being mixed, while in reality the whole of it was black, he was at once transferred to the station. The owner of the tea could not as yet be acertained, as the chests had been delivered, but the company would no doubt bave a complaint of the loss, if they did not discover him themselves, and the prisoner, who bad nothing to say in answer to the charge, was therefore committed for the com. pletion of the evidence.
CLERRENWELL.-Thomas Lay, a young man, was brought up on a warrant before Mir. CORRIE charged by Sarah Hulme, a portly-looling woman, with having violently assaulted her under the following circumstances:-
The complainant said that she had been cohabiting with the prisoner as man and wife since she had left her husband some months ago. He had been in the habit of using her in a brutal manner, beating aud kicking her, until at length she determined on taking legal proceedings against him. She obtained a suummons at this court, which was placed in the hands of Randall, the warrant officer, for execution, but the prisoner endeavoured to evade its service, and she then obtained a warrant for his apprehension, and hewca_turdon the previous day and locked up. She added," adot wish to hurt him, your worship, although hehassoilIusedme. Iwould not hurt a hair ofathe poor fellow's head; I only wish him to keep away from me in future, and never come near me any more. Since I took out the summons he has cut his throat, and attempted to cut mine, and I am afraid, and go in dangerof my life."
Mr. CORi.-That is a reason why you should prosecute him, for the sake of protection.
Randall, the officer, said it was true that the prisoner had cut his throat, which was now bandaged up, and he had made an attempt to cut the throat of MIrs. Hulme, who, he understood, was a woman of violent temper, as was also the prisoner.
Mrs. Hulme (entreatingly).-Oh, dear ! your worship, pray forgive him. I would not hurt a hair of his head.
Randall said the wound in the prisoner's throat was severe, and he was attended by Dr. Butler, who dressed it.
Mr. CoRRni asked the prisoner what he had to say.
The prisoner (who could not turn his head).-I am very sorry for what Ihave done, your worship ; bnt she (pointing at Mrs. Hulme) is a violent woman, with a bad temper, and she aggravated me to do what I did. I am very sorry for it.
Mr. CORBre saiditwas very foolish and wicked. He should fine him 10s. and the costs, or in default a week's imprisonment, having no doubt he would reflect while in prison, and it would do him some good.
He was conveyed to prison.
Wben Mrs. Hulme left the court, on getting outside she wssviolently assailed by a mob of her own sex with groans and yells, and a cry of "Who left her husband to live with a young man'," &c., and shp would have been very roaghly handledhad itnot'oeenforthe interference of the police.

COURT OF BANKRUPTCY, Basinghall-street, March 18.
COURT OFBANKBUPTOZ, Baingheret, March1';.
IN RE THE ROYAL BRITISH BANK.
(Before Mr. Commssioner HOLROnAi
'his was a meeting for the further examination of 3Mr. Edward Esdaile, the late Governor of the Bank.
Mr. Linklater appeared for the assignees; Mr. Venning appeared for Mr. Esdaile; Mr. Ellis appeared also to watch the proceedings on behalf of the friends of the late Mr. Charles Walton, one of the directors.
Mrs- VxMW, addressing the Commissioner, said,Mr. Esdaile, on reading over the transcript of the shorthand writer's notes of his examination taken last week, finds that there are certain parts of it which he is unwilling to sign, because he has run into some errors in some of his 3tatements, and he wishes your Honour to afford him an opportunity of explaining.
The Cos3ussioNxR.-Yes, certainly, if it is right in point of fact; that is, if he said what is stated here you had better not alter it, but let him give any explanation he likes.
MIr. VENNXnG.-In any way your Honour sees fit.
Mr. 1JNanuxATr -I stated to Mr. Venning that that was the ordinary course adopted here. Mr. Esdaile had better sign these three sheets.
The ComruSoso u.-And anything he thinks that requires explanation he wiU have en opportunity of explaining.
Mr. LsxTn-I would suggest that the better way would be to commence with any explanation which he thinks necessary with reference to his last examination.
Mr. VExsnsx.-Will your Honour permit me to put a question to him with a -view to elicit the explanation which he wishes to give?
The Co.MmnssioNmR.-Yes, you may.
Mr. VEmNNU .-The first matter is with relation to the advance made by Mr. Cameron to the witness (Mr. Esdaile) of that sum of 5001., which your Honour will remember, and which the witness stated upon a former occasion had been discounted by him through Mr. Cameron. I want to ask you, is that the promissory note ? (Handing it to the iwitness.)-Yes.
The transaction arose, I think, out of an application made to you to increase the number of shares which you held in the bank ?-Yes.
You stated to Mr. Cameron it was not convenient to you to abstract that money from your business at that time ?- Yes.
Mr. LINKLATEP.-This is one way of examining a gentle. maan.
Mr. VENsNa.-It is the shortest way, 31r. Linklater. It is a kind of cross-examination.
The ComU ssIOrMs.-What he has just been saying he has already stated.
Mr. LLiKLATm-Yes, Sir.
Mr. VM;NNG.-The witness went into an error.
The Co03rimsssoNoss.-I think he introduced the subjee, Ask Mr. Esdaile if he wishes to give any explanation with reference to that loan of 56Q. from Ir. Camen. Mr Esdaile will give his own version.
The witness.-The explanation I wish to give is simply that it was a private transaction between myself and Mr. Cameron upon that note, payable upon demand; that I was not aware that the money was coming from any source but Mr. Cameron's own private sources.
Mr. VENNG.-In point of fact it never was discounted and it never was even endorsed. There is the note rhadind
it in]. It would be much more convenient if I could put my questions, Mr. Linklater.
3Mr. LINKLATM.-It would be a pity if there should be any misunderstanding upon the subject. Your Honour has observed that Mr. Esdaile's explanation leaves the matter very much where it was. I will put one question to Mr. Bsdaile.
Mr. VENNmUG.-There is this difference. Mr. Esdaile alleges that he never on any occasion availed himself of the funds of the bank. It makes a great difference in point of character to himself whatever error of judgment he may have been guilty of. He never on any occasion took advan. tage of his position as a director to make use of the funar of the bank. There Is a broad distinction, and which your Honour will see is important, with reference to the conduct of this gentleman.
Mrh c.KLATExu-We will deal with the consequences another time.
Mr. VES-NNmG.-They are before us now.
Mr. LISZKLATEB-Do I understand you to say that you did not believe that the money provided by gr. Cameron in respect of that 500l-note came out of the coffers of the bank ?-Oat of his own private account with the bank.
Did you not believe that the moneys came from the coffers of the bank ?-Only from his own private account with the bank, which I had no reason to suppose was anything but in credit with the bank at that time. I believed he 'was in credit with the bank.
You believed he drew upon the bank for that 5007.?-
That seems to me to leave it where it was?-It does not so.
Mr. VEY NLN.-The bank being his bankers, any checks he drew-if he paid his butcher he would draw a check upon the bank.
Mr. LsxtLAxTE1-Or draw upon Aldgate pump
hlr. VM'Ga.-The bank would honour the check; the pump would not. It would be mach more convenient if I could be allowed to put my questions.
The ComvissioNEn.-T have already said you may state enough to draw Mr. Esdaile's attention to the point he wishes to give any explanation about.
Mr. VENNsIN .-I was wishing to call the witnese's attention to the 7,000 which was deficient in point of cash payment. Your Honour will recollect that an observation fell from your Honour which your Honour said was contrary to law. Mr. Eldaile wishes to explain how far he was person-
r. LIATEB.-I do not know whether I can save my friend any trouble, but I may tell him, after going into one or two general matters to-day, it will be my duty to take Mr. Esdaile through the whole circumstances connected with the formation, progress, and failure of the bank, and
tat wil certainly be an opportanity which he will have ol excplainig howv the capital was raised from time to time. Whether that will alter my friend's course or not I do not Mr. VEITfNrG.-You have already got in evidence certain statements which the witness now wishes to explain-how far he was an actor in the matter.
The witness.-I merely wish to explain to the Commis. sioner that my acts were in conformity with the advice placed before the board by our solicitor at that time.
Mr. PADDuISOS.-YOU mean Mr. Mullins?.-Yes, Mr.
Mr. VYENNL;G.-There is a minute to that effect, is there not ?-Yes; I beheve so.
You are desirous also of explaining your ehare in that transaction, as to the 3,1004 which was drawn out by the directors for paymentfor their own services?-I find by referencetomy private accountthatI received-in the middle of November, I think it was-801. Is. 9d. for those services.
Hlow much for each attendance had you ?-I presume the average was about 15s. for each attendance for that year
Now, as to the money returned to the shareholders at NTewcastle, which has been put down as an illegal act on the part of the directors, I beheve you wish also to explain upon that head y-I believe it was no psrt of the capital certified to the Board of Trade.
It was no part of the 42,0001. afterwards returned ? (To the Commissioner.) The witness wishes to explain it was Intecedent to the time of the charter being applied for.- lam giving my belief.
I will now call your attention to the charge of careless. ness or neglect which has been brought against you-that after you were governor you permitted Mr. Cameron's balance to increase from sometning about 15,000l. to something like 19,0001.-perhaps you will explain what the facts relative to that matter are ?-That was principaly owing, to the extent of 3,5001., to a transaction of Mr. Cameron's, which took place quite unknown to the directors. After he had left the bank it was reported to us by our accountant thatl a trans. action had taken place of a very informal character, and it would bear another name. In the earlier years of the bank it appears that Mr. Cameron had drawn from the bank 3,500., which he desired the accountant to enter under the name of the "New Three per Cents.;" that was subsequently transferred, why we, as directors, knew not, to an account entitled " The Royal British Linen Company of Scotland." That was I think in 1851 or 1852 * I am not qouite ertain. In June, 1856, Mr. Cameron came to mr. Crawford and said, "Here is a check, or an order at 14 days, upon the Royal British Linen Company of Scotland; discount it upon my account, and I will lodge agaitthat d t shares to the amount," and he
dinMz. Crawford's hands a packet containing shares to that amount, with the instruction that he was not to make use of that note without an order. That sum of 3,500., therefore, was debited to Mr. Cameron's discount account within a day or two of his leaving the bank quite unknown to Us. We were not privy to the transaction in any shape until he'had left the bank, but that will account for 3,501. of the difference between the 15,0001. which Mr. Linklater Will find was the amount when I went to the chair and the 1,9001. at which it closed.
ESlain to his Hlonour how the transaction first came to your novvledge. .Through Mr. Crawford, the accountant.
From his reporting it to you. Do you wish to explain ? It has gone forth in the public papers that. in the green-book there was a personal account of yonzs.-Certainly, there
Youl had neither a drawing account, nor a discount, cash, nor_any_other acount..7-No aceount whatever.
nor. s xny othe accou with respet whatevpessre. hc
.a -V EN-G.-Xo`w, with zespect to the pressure which Mr. Linldater put upon you the other day on the subject of the 120 00 involved in the Welsh mines.
Mr. IASLATI.-YOU will have that al1 over again.
Mr. VMNINMG.-Not throrgh our lips, but through your lips, which makes a great diference.
Mr. LIwKLATEB.-Yes, you will.
Mr. VENN.NG.-You were pressed very much as to your knowledge from time to time that this was a totally bad debt ; explain what the state of your mind was.-I wish to take this opportunity of stating that at the time of the
closing of the bank the impression was still fordble on our minds that we had the chance of redeeming that loss to the bank, because we had in our hands a report drawn up by a professional man, in connexion with the South Vales mineral field, to the effect that the mine showed within itself Ha capacity of yielding an annual profit of 16,0001. ere is the report; it is printed, and put into the hands of the assignees. At the same time
I further wish to state thas 'we had been in treaty with
parties, very shotly before the closing of the bank, who
expressed a great readiness to give a royaty on the producoe of the mines which, we believed, wrould haveimpressed such a vale on the property as would have covered the outlay of [the bank upon it. These were our impressions, and under
those convictions, or under that belief, we did not feel juat.
edin putting that down as a doubtfl figure. I may, per. baps, just referto one matter-I wish to correct an impression which has gone abroad totally foreign [to what I intended to sav, hr. Linidatcr; in one particular paragragh I was referring to one of the causes which precipitated the fall of the bank, and I said, "UJp to the period of that half-yearly meeting we were in hopes-and I
wizsh this to go forth mnost distinctly-we wereA
in hopes, with our new management, with our now position, with the vastly improved scale of business, and With improved confidenoe, that we might have worked through our diffiulties, knowing what other institutions have done. We re not the only ones who have had very serious blots to face iu the early stages of their existence." Azd then I go on to say, 1 "But we are the only ones," the Ehorthandwritersays, "thatthathasbeenfastenedcupon." -withafuU stop. hen Igo onto say, "I will not give yon the name, it is at my tongue's end." That was totally foreign to my nieaning. I am not aware of having used the words "at my tongue's end" at all. Wbat I did intend to say was that we were the only ones that had been fastened upon in a way to which I will not give a name. I make tho alteration because I am told out of doors it has been inferred that I pointed to some competing bank. It was perfectly foreign to my intentions. I was referring to the attacks to which we had been subjected, and which had seriously impaired the confidence of the publia. I only wish to remove the impression that I had thrown out any imnptation against any other establishment, which was far from
r. LnTkL&TEm.-1 wiU reserve to a future period the exosure of the fallacy of your present explanation, and I v ow roeed wnth the examination that I intend to conducttoday.You toldu7s tyhat you became governor of

onr. Y NrNG.-One year 7-Mr. Paddison says it was one year.
Mr. IrLA.T-MS r. Faddison says you were deputygovernor for one year before you took the chair. I was asking was Mr. Frederick Clark-e a director of the bank at any time ?-Yes.
Do you remember whether he became a director about February, 1852?7-He might have done. I have not the date in my recollection.
And went out of the direction about February, 1853?-
TI = you on the occasion of your last examination whether you were aware in the month of June, 1855, that the bank was in a state of hopeless insolvency. Now, I ask you, did you ever bear in the early part of the year 1854 that the bank had been insolvent from the month of February, 1852 ?-Not to my knowledge.
It is not an unimportant circumstance, and I must repeat myquestionto you. Did youin the early part of 1854 hear

Do you know Mr. Clarke's handwriting ?-Yes.
Look to that signature only at present, and tell me if it is his signature (handing a letter to the witness) 7-I believe itis; Ihlvereasontosupposethatitis.
Now, will you look to the letter, and tell me whether you have ever seen that letter before ?-(After looking) I dare say I have.
When do you think you ftrst saw it97-The personal opinion of Mr. Clarke is contained in it.
When did you first see that letter ?-I cannot say at aU.
About when ?-I caanot say. I should think not until some time after it had been received. (To Mr. Paddison) Who is this addressed to? Perhaps you can refresh my recollection.
3Mr. 1sdale, you are under examination now, and not 'Mr. Paddison ?-I cannot say.
I will read the letter, "129, Great Tower-street, London, May 30, 1854," it appears it was received by Mr. Paddison; it begins "without prejudice."
Mr. VYm,iNG.-Sir, I beg to appeal to your Honour whether the personal opinion expressed ina bletter of some gentUeman whno has left the directhon that in his opinion this bank was insolvent ought to be imperted in this examination. It app ears to me not to be X ofaircse of examina-
The Co%nussro2ym-I see no objection to that.
The Witness.-At all events, whatever inference you are going to draw from that, I distinctly say at this moment-
The Co 0-imoNi.-You had better go on by derees. We had better have the letter read, and if it gives rise to anthing which you wish to explain you can do so.
Mr. LXlARm.-There seems to be an extraordinary misconception with reference to the object of this inquiryit is not personally to Mlr. Eadaile alone.
Mr. YxNrN.-It appears to me to be damaging to al the creditors of the bank as far as dividend is concerned.
Mr. LuniTER.-I have no doubt that is the personal opinion of all the directors.
Sir,-I have recelved your letter. and wiIl not exprees any surris
at its contents after the monstroniy ungrateful and nad unut eduet I have before received from your clients. I found the bank absolutely iceolvent when I joined it through tbeir previous had management, and made the nmost elf-acnfIing effost to redeem it, without
any prospect of reward until I bad fireu accomplished their emax. cipation. ana this is the reward. Butsa da o reekoninewi]] come.

The Witness.-Willjyou favour me with tat date ?
Mr. VEl an u.-erhaps you will read the letter to which that is anU answer.
Mr. LWnLATm4-I shall conduct my examination in my own way, without your interference.
-Mr. f teNCat-Certainly; but it is subject to the control of the Court.
Mr. LLUxTM-Always subject to the control of the court.
Mr. VzNnTG.-I suggested to you as a mtan of great experience in this Court, as you undoubtedly are-
The Co, sssINrozn.-If you have anything to say, it may not give rise to any more questions.
Mlr. VENG.-n is a11 ad invidian.
Mr. LnN-.srT s-You will find a great deal of ad ividiasa before we have done with it.
TheWitness.-My remark is this,-t thepresent moment Ihave no knowledge or recollection of whalt r. Clarke means by using the terms "m monstrous ingratitude and unjust conduct." In the secondplace, I stated just now, it was notin my recollction when anybody stated to me the bank was insolvent. I have no recollection of the fact of that letter, nor of the assertions contained in it.
No doubt, black and white sometimes become exceedingly convenient. Look to the resolution of the Court of Directors of the 6th of June, 1854, and teU me whether that letter of Mr. Clarke's of the 30th of May was read before the court of directors?-What was your question?
My question is was it read?-Ipresume so. I was not present.
You were the deputy-governor 7-Wa s I? I must have been. Ididnotseemynamedown* thatisall.
The entry is on the 6th of June, 1854-Present, among others, "the deputy-governor ?'-That of course was myself.
It says, " read, also, *Lletter dated the 30th of May, from !zr. Clarke, in reply to the solicitor's letter to him, which was read at the last court." M[r. Clarke had, I think, at that time broutght an action against the bank for the recovery of sums expended by him in the course of his management of the mines itn Wales 7-Yes, I believe that was so.
And the hank favoured him with a cross-aetiort for breach of contract ?
Mr. V m;sG.-It brought a cross-action ?-Yes, that is so, I believe.
gr. LTLAT,n-Were those actions compromised 9- They were.
By the payment of 2,000L by the bank ?-I believe so. You will 11ow me to sy (and I wish the answer to be made under the correction of my solcitor) I am not clear as to the facts because they are not at all clear in my mind.
Do not mistake me in supposing I am asking for any information which is not within your own knowledge ?-It IS not within my recollection.
On the 11th of July I see there was a meeting of the court. at which, it appears, you were psent as the deputy-
And the entryisthis-" Thesolidtor repo*-tsto thecourt that the action of ' Clarke v. the Royal British Bank' had to-day been called on for trial at GuPldhall, but that the parties, acting under the advice of their respective counsel, had agreed that the verdict should be given for the plaintiff for 2,uOOL. without a trial of the questions raised on the pleadings." Does that now enable you to say that the
actionwascompromised bypaymentof asnumof 2,000O?-
Was that compromise effected by the directors because they feared the expense of that trial7-I sbould say that it was.
Were you not aLt that time told that the Attorney-General, now the Lord Chief Ju-stice of the Court of Common Pleas, had said that the directors of the bank would be made to allow that case to go into court ?-I believe that did come to -my kmowledge.
Mr. LIER.ATn-Mr. Venning, I must not have you suggesting anything to the witness while he is under examination.
Mr. VEtNLyTG.-I am not suggesting. I only wish the truth to appear.
M1r. ILYHATXR. -So do I, but not by suggestion from
MIr. VmR? T(.-Mr. Paddison was explaining what the matter nmeat.
Mr. IETATM-Mr. Charles Walton, who is lately bead,n iesI believe, for some time the governor of the
Do you remember the circumstance of his having been absent Y serious illes from an early part of December, 1854, to the end of June, 1855 ?-1 believe so.
And during that time you, as deputy-governor, generally filled the chair ?-Yes.
Did You become aware in the early part of January, 1855, that Mr. Walton was largely indebted to the bank?I beliTev dId.-
Did you become aware that he was indebted to the bak at that time in upwardsof 30,000L ?-When I first referred to that book of course I becamne aware thatl in Mr. Walton's discount account a very large sum appeared to his debit.
I am now speaking of a period antecedent to the 12th of June -I r When I first had occasio torerr o tat ookI henbecmeaware of the fact. Wlyou swear that 7.-I believe I can swear it.
W JllyOU-I can swearthat my knowledge of Mr. Waslton's account was derved from my inspectior of that
Wil you swear you had not before the general meeting of thleistof February, 1855,w knowledge of the fact that

that Ihdid not rfer to that ledger until aft;er I lad asumed
Did you find that statement to be inaccurate .-Imst say so. For instance, allow me to explain.
With great pleasure.-What had led my recollection back
to that fact is that it was in consequenco of the state of th account, and of the backwardness which was evinced by Mr. Walton in rmaking over a certain security that Mr. 8pens, tr. Lockhart Vaillart, Mr. AldermanoKenned
andl mnyself bad determined that-Mr. Charles Walton could not longer with propriety fill that chair. It was the recollection of that group of factz that led my mnind to the belief that I mnst have been cognizant of that account before I took the chair. So far I am aware thalt it is not consistent with mny previous evidence. I did not open that bbook or know its contents nntil after I ws in the chair, but I think it must be quite evident tbht I must have seen Mr. Charles Walton's account before that.
How long before the gneral meeting of February, 1855? -You say the 12th of January. It might habv been about that time when it was first brought before me. Allow me to say, Mr. Ltnklater, I cannot, after much thought, recollect the fact what in the first instance drew my attention to that accouLt. I think it was in connexion with Mr. Paddison, with an irregularity in themaking ont of that security.
It is possible I may help your memory beFore long, Mr. EEdale. MIr. Cameron, I think I understand you to say was abEent from the bank from the timo of the generai meeting till the Ist of February, 1855 ?-Yes. I do not know exactly that he quitted the bank.
Mr. ELis.-Will you allow me to suggest, Mr. Linklater? I represent here Mr. Walton's family. On one occasion it was said, and I want to know what is meant by Mr. Charles Walton being indebted to the bank,-whether it was not a discount accunt ?
Mr. LLISXT&vE -If my friend Mr. Ellis will kindly reserve any question he wishee to put I shall offer no objection, but he willfind there will be a good deal more matter as to the question by-and-by.
Mr. ELLiS-That is very likely, but if it is said that a man is indebted to the bank it is quite as well to explain that at the time, because, ordinarily speaking, a man is not considered to be indebted in a commercial sense on a mere discount account with good bills in the hands of a party, and the transaction being a discount of bills only.
The Witess.-That is the only sense in which we mean that Mr. Walton was indebt-ed to the bank-upon advanoes upon bills.
Mr. LRLATEM.-Do not let there be any misunderstandig either way.
lEr. LLIS.-I am suro Mr. Linklater does not wish there should be any rmisunderstanding.
Mr. rr~ui~.-Tesethigs et ntothepapers from dat to day wvithout thhe a^nttidonte besieng,npltdhepprsfo
Mr. Vgzll -Ii*pply the observation to my own
Ir. LL RLA.rx-There are so many RichTnonds in the field that I do not know which to answer first. I will direct my questions to you, if you please. Was Mr. Cameron in attendance upon the bank up to the bank up to the 1st of Febmary, 5 I-Up to the Ist of February, I presume he was.
How long before the 1st of February had you seen this green ledger?-I cannot say. I do not think that I could have examined any acount in it until about the date you said-the 12th of January.
Before the 1st of Febrary, 1855, did you direct your attention to ny ether ccount in that book than Mr. Walton's .-I beeve not.
But your memory mnav be possibly refreshed upon that subject also .-If it was so I should at once tell yeu.
At all events, you became aware of the existence of this green ledger some days before MIr. Cameron left the honk? -Yes, not knowing wvhat accounts it contained.
Did you know that Mr. Walton's account was in it ?
I understood you to say that you had looked at it with a view of seeing the state of Mr. Walton's accoimt?-Not till the 12th of January.
I am now speaking of the 12th of January. Did you refer to the book on the 12th of January, sO as to see the state of Mr. Walton's account ?-I really cannot say that I did. The amount of Mr. Walton's discount might have been given to me from Mr. Walton's scrip books.
Admitting, as you nO do, that you became avware of the existence of this green ledger before the 1st of February, 18t5h5,dkid you refer to any account in it before thatday.7-
The Coox3u 02soNrgs-I thoueht you said just now that you derived your knowledge of the state of M[r. Walton's account from the green book-I am not' certain upon that point. It might have been submitted to me from Mr. Walton's discount scrip-book. The grounds for my observation are these-because I think it highly pobable that, had

The Co.mssssmoNw -You just said you did not g
your attention to any account but Mr. Walton's. You think it was on the 12th of January?-Whether my knowvledge of Mr. Walton's accounts was derived from the gren book or from the discount scrip-book I do not know.
=ha uo or th Inedlvbt. h bhxanek in bills to the extent of Mr. IaNxATER..-Did you learn, in the month of January, 1855, that MIr. Walton wras indebted to the bank in upwards of 42,OO1. 7-I dare say we did.
Do I understand ;ou to say that you did not instantly take the trouble to inquire into the nature of the account, and see the book containing it t-That led me to the question of the securities.
Was that before the 1st of Febrary, 1l559.-I think so, The basis of my belief is that it was the state of Mr. Walton's general transactions with the bank which induced those three gentlemen, Mr. Spens, 3Mr. Lockhart Vaillart, and Mr. Alderman Kennedy to unite with me in deemig it expedent under these crcumstances that Mr. Walton should no longer fill the chaiir.
Did you learn in the month of January, 185, that Mr. Walton was applying for further discounts ?-I have no recolection of the fact. In January, 1855 ?
Yes.-I do not know. I have no recollection of the fact. Were you not told in the month of January, 185, " That it was absolutely necessary you should continue to discount Mr. Walton's bills, not only to prevent their stopping payment, but for the safety of the bank itself, which must faU if the governor and two of the directors fail, with whom will also stop six or seven other persons connected with the bank." I ask you, did you not hear that in January, 1855 ?-It is very likely that I did.
Do I understand you to say that, having very likely heard that in January, 1855, you took no trouble to look into Mr. Walton's account, you being deputy-governor and he governor?- I1 prosmme it was those circamstances which led me to investigate the securities which the bankheld.
You told us on the last occasion that it was the account of Mr. Humphrey Brown which directed your attention to the subject ..well, they were both mixed up together, a large prtioa of Mr. Walton's discount account being biUls upon . Humphrey Browna against which were these said securities which were placed in the bank.
Were these said securities the mere deposit *f mortgaes, or bills of sale of vessels .-In two instances, I believe, they were the deposit of the mortgages themselves, and one was merely the deposit of the memorandum of the bill of sale.
Was there no entry on the register of any claim on the part of the bank ?-Which was the irregularity which led us to take those measures against theresumption by Mr.Walton of the chair. Yonwll correct me if am wrong, Mr. Paddison.
Mr. Viwmia.-Will you all-ow me, Mr. LinklaterMr. I rvx-I must conduct my examination in my own way, Mr. Venning.
Mr. VMUNU-G.-I could save a great deal of trouble, that is all
Mr. Lu NFrmT.-Do you remember in the month of MArch or April, 1855, your attention being directed to the proprnety of looking into the 71st clause of the charter, or rather the state of the bank with referenco to that clause, for the purpose of seeing how far the bank was justified in going on another hour ?-I have no recollection of tho particuiar incident to which you allude.
I must refresh your memory again. Do you remember M1r. Humphrey Brown calling your attention to the subject at a meeting of the court at which you were in the chair in Mrch or Ari, 1855 -I do not know what dato it was.
In the ear y part of 1855 ?-It might have been.
Was Mr. Alderman Kennedy present ?-I do not know.
It is rather an important question, you know. Or did it occur so frequently 7-Not at all. It was merely a by remark upon a particular day of one of the directors.
Do you remember it now 2-Now YoU refer to it I do.
Will you tell us what it was?-I bave no recolloction of the circumstance otherwise than as you state it.
Pethaps you can tel us what this simplo remark was ?- Mr. Brown was sitting at the table, And he might have said he thought it behoved us to look at the bearing of the 71st clause upon the position of the bank; it was his own remark.
Nothing more ?-Not that I know of.
Oh ! try-come-try your memory a little more, Mr. Esdaile, if you please. The question of whether the doors of the bank should be closed or not, and whether the shareholders should be called together for the purpose of considering that question, was not an unimportant circumstance in the city of London.-It ws not mooted in the grave way you seem to think.
I must try again. Do you remember Mr. Huniphrey Brown sying he ws prepared to prove that the bank had come within the terms of the 71st clause '-I cannot say
Do you remember hi saying that he would speak to the Attorney-General in the lobby of the House of Commons upon the subject some fine morning ?-I cannot charze my recolection with that even. I think it was a most unalikely thgng for him to say.
I shOUl-d think so,too. Did he not call the attention of tghe Court to the ls they had made with the Welsh works, and the snta of Dma mers account?-I have no recollection of it.
Did not Mr. Paddison ma'ke a long speech upon the occasion ?-I do not know; it is not in my recolection. I have aiready admitted, Mr. LIinklater, that before that time of course the directors of the bank were anxious as to their general postion.
was at not said that the Attorney-General would be rather mn awkward subject to mention the matter to, seeing he ha been concerned in the action of " Clarke against the Bank- 2-I do not remember making that observation.
Will you undertake to say that it was not made ?-I cannot say so. You are now dweling on a matter of immense importance,u pn aconversation,which ocupgd perhaps a quarter of an bour, and to which the teructorsIgave no serious heed, as Iknmow of. I do not recollect.
Do you remember Mr. AldermunKennedy saying to Mir. PAdldison, "Is it true, 3Mr. Parldison, that if we carry on the bank after incurring loss, within'the termst of the 71st clause, that we absll do So nPon Our Own responsibility' I do not recollect. It might have been so.
ThaLt Ig a convenient an3wer?-That is the only asixwer I can give.
Do yen mean to say thot you have no recollection of that circumstance?-Hot of that obeervation of Mr. Alderman Kennedy.
,'Nor anything to that effect 7-I think not.
Youthik not. Willyouswearaot ?-Ibellevenot.
But you will not swear It did not take plac in your presence ?-I should not like to say that.
Was not the answer to 3Mr. Alderman Kenneody that undoubtedly the directors would carry or, the hank upon their own responsibility if they chose, in the fwac of the fact that they were withLin the terms of the 71st clxusi of
the charter 1-It was an answer, I think,which3Mr. Paddi-J
son would very likely give if such a question was put to him.
Was not the result of that discusion a determination to go on and Issue new shares ?-I am not at all prepared to y so. Not that I know of.
Are you prepared to say, upon your oath, it waS not?I have no recollection of the circumstance at alL I have no recolection of the issue of new shares being mixed up with what you call the discussion upon the 71st clause. (To Mr. Paddison.) If yonhave any recollection of it, say so. I haveno motive for concealing it.
Mr. L tsenh atrx- shal have occasion to examine Mr. Paddison hereater.
The Witness-It would be more convenient if Afr. Paddicon would say so, to prevent my giving a wrong impresion to the public. If Mr. Paddison states it, then i wil admit it at once.
Mr. LupNTx&Tzst.-The impression you are to give is to be the truth as near as ou can state it.
Mr. PADDISON.-Iwould rather be examined upon oath.
Mr. LNRhuAEnR.-I should take caro that you were; not that I intend to imputo anything. Mr. Esdaile has invited the inqumry, and it may b oonvenient to him to have his memory refreshed by any statement that Mr. Paddison may make upon oath with respect to that.
Tbe Conas85ussroNxp..t would be breaking the thread of the examination.
Mr. LA.T =-It does to some extent, but I am not sure it would not bo with advantago.
The Co0exfsso0Nxs-Very well
Richard Paddison, sworn and examined by Mr. LsnxLATEss-Mr. Richard Paddison, you were for three or four years before the Royal British Bank closed its doors the secretary and solicitor of the bank, I think ?-For two years solely, at least from the gingiiB of 1854.
Was your partner, the lte Mr. Mulins, previous to that time attending exclusively to the affairs of the bank ?-He was as to the legal matters and confidential matters.
As to its formation and confidential matters ?-Wholly as to the formation, and almost wholly as to the legal matters, and solely as to the confidential matters.
Do I understand you that you had to do merely with the routine part of the legal business of the bank7-Precihely so.
But from February, 1855, down to the closing of the bank you wero in the habit of attending the various courts that were held as secretary ?-,I wa
Do you remember about the month of March or April, 1855, a discussion before the Board, or rather the Court, for it is a Roeal Bank,twith reference to the terms of the 71st clause of tre charter.7-I do.
Bekind enough to tell uswhat took placo-Mr.lHumphrey Brown, at a meeting of the Court, at which the Governor was present, *nd I recollect perfectly well also lMr. Aiderman Kennedy, iniroduced a series of observations with reference to the position of the bank in his view in regard to the nst clause of the charter, which relates to the amount of IOBS which would bring the hank to the necessity, according.to their provisionis, of winding up its affairs, and caling toether the shareholders. Mfr. Brown stated in a long, rambling spmeeh, I may call it his opinion, that he was prepared to parve that the hahnk ahd by its loss, or had sus-
tied a loss, which would bring it.within provison 7L He was asked how he proved it, and he referred to the amount of loss upon the Welsh works.
Do I understand yon that all this tookplaceinthe presence of Mr. Esdaile, the then governor 1-Yes. He then stated that in his view the bank had upon the Welsh works alone sustained a loss, which would bring it within that provision - and, in order to prove his point, he referred to an alleged offer of the bank at rome time previous to accept if they could get it, 40,000?. through Mr. Arthur DGmmQer, for the purchase of the works, and to another fact, as he stated,tLat thatttime theyhad fixed40,0001.as thereserved bidding for the sale of their works in the summer of 1854, when they offered them for sale through Messrs. Fuller and Horsey. Ho then went on to mare some general references to the loss sustained by Mr. Oliver, but did not state the amount. He then went on to say that, under those circumstances, he thought thatthe shareholders ought to be caUed together, andif they carried on the affairs of the bank in their then state they would undoubtedly do so upon their own personal responsibility. He, for one, objected to encounter that responsibility, and protested against the contemplated issue of new shares. He fmther intimated his intention of sealdn
to tbe Attorney-General upon the subject in the House ol Commons, where he had an opportunity of meeting him, and of putting the case under fictitious names, that he might not call the Attorney-General's attention to the fact that it was the Royal British Bank that was the object of in m,-v. That was the purport of Mr. Brown's speech. iher 'in the course of it, or immediately after he had finished, I got up to make some observations with reference to what Mr. Brown stated respecting the alleged proposal to take 40,0001. for the works from M1r. Albert Diimmler, and also with reference to his statement that 40,0001. had been the sum fixed by the Court for its reserved bidding upon the question of the works being offered for sale through Messrs. Fuller and Horsey, which facts were withi my own cognizance. 'Upon these two points Mr. Brown, I inted out, was mistakenthat I did not believe tht there had ever been any offer to sel the works through Mr. Albert DLiarmler for 40,0001. ; at least, I was not cognizant of any such instructions ever having been given to MIr. Diimmler for that purpose, or of any offer which Mr. Brown alleged bad been made by Mr. Diimmler to find a purchaser for 35,OODl. I further stated that Mr. Brown was mistaken in his assertion that 40,000?. was the amount at which the court of directors had fixed the reserved bidding on the occasion of the sale. I do not precisely recollect I said what that amount was, but 1 was quite sure that it was more than 60,0001. So far as to d&Ma. I was asked a question in the course of my observations by Mr. Alderman Kennedy, as near as I can recollect, in these words,-" I ask yon, M1r. Paddison, as our solicitor, is Mr. Brown's assertion correct, that if we carry on the affairs of this bank after having sustained a loss which wil bring us within the 71st clause, -we shall do so upon our individual re'ponaibility 7"1 To that queationa I repliedf without hesitation. that undoubtedly if the directors should carry on the affairs of the bank, after having ascertained that they had sustained such lose, they would do so upon their own individual responsi. lity. "B ut," I said, " it is for the directors themselves to inquire whether they have sustained such a loss or not. If they ascertain that they have not, but that they are in great canger, it is for them to considerwhether by any steps which they can take they can retrieve their position and avoid being predipitated over the precipice." With regard to Mr. Brown's suggestion, that he would speak to the Attorney-General, a s the solicitor, protested against it
sbeinr an irreguar thing, saying that it would certainly bea violation of Ar. Brown's declaration of secrecy to speak to any third party on such a point as that; and that he only flattered himself by the suppositionz that he could conceal from the Attorney-General by fictitious names the fact that the Royal British Bank was the object of his inquiry, for I reminded him that the Attorney. General only in the year before-in the summer before, had held a brief for the loyalBrit*sh Bank in the action brought against it by Mr. Clarke, in which brief all the facts relating to the position of the bank with regard to these works were fuUy disclosed. Mr. Brown made no distinct motion and after that the disdussion dropped, Mr. Alderman Ken. nedy observing that he was satisfied by the solicitor's explanation that they might go on-an observation which I confess rather surprised mo at the time, because I had given a very plain answer to a very plain question, and had referred the inqiry and the facts as to the bank's position to the directors themselves.
Now, Mr. Eadaile, having your memory refreshed by this statemenb of Mr. Paddison, do you recollect the circumstanoes to which ho has advertea?-I believe that Mr. Paddison's statement is correct. Allow me to add, that the thing was treated by myself and others with great indifference. At the time Wr. Brown was a very heavy debtor to the bank, and we believed something, by his manner and In his purpose, which he did not choose to make apparent
I do not quite understand that answ er, Mr. Esdiaile. Do you mean by Mr. Brown's manner you fancied he thought that he had the directors in his power?-I do not know what he thought. I did not understand, and my brother diectors did not understand, what ws the obiect of Mr Browvn at that particular time in meeting the subject, which was not germain, as no proceeding was on tho board for the day but, looking to the state of his indebtedness to the bankc we surmised ho might have his ow;n private reason for what be did,
Do you mean hoe as putting the screw on for his own purposes ?-Whatever he thought I do not know.
That is what you thought was what he meant?-He might have thought it would be the means, perhaps, of inducing us to be more lenient to himself. Whatever his thoughts were, I can only ascribo it to some imagination of the Sort.
Did you suspect at thattime that that vas his motive?Not I did not. I troated the whole thing Nnth a great deal of indifference.
You told us that Mr. Cameron returned in AMay, 1655 ?- Yes.
Did 3Mtr. Cameron frequentlyvcall the attention of the Court to the71st clause after he returnod ?-I think once or twice he did.
And that was before the half-yearly meeting of August, 1855 ?-Ido not know; I cannot say thiat, but it miight have been so,
I have rather an object in that inquiry, and I do notwish to tak- you at any disadvantage. I want you to call your memory back, if yon can, to that time, See whether you can tell me whether or not Mr. Cameron, before the half-yearly meeting of August, 1855. several
nties called the attention of the Court to that 71st cause9,
-I cannot caU my attention to before Aupust, 1855, but that he did so in the courso of the year 1355) I have every reason to believe.
Several times ?-I do not know how often, but once or twice.
Now, Mr. Spens, I think, was a director of the bank, was he not ?-Yes.
lz. SPCDS becamne a director of the bank on the 25th of July, 1854, and went out on the 31st of May, 1855- are thoseyabot the dates.-I beieve o, to the best of my recollection.
NTow, lIr. Spena's retirement was discussed, I surpose, at the Court in hay, 1855 7-I do not know that there was any discussion.
Were you not told, in May, 1855, that the contemplated retirement of Mr. Spens was something serious, and required a 8erious course on the part of the directorst-I cannot bear in mind the particular circumstance or fact to which you allude.
Have you no recollection of having been told so by Mr Alderman Kennedy at that time?-I have it notin mi4 recollection. I will not say it was not so.
Were you told at that time by MIr. Alderman Rennedy that it wss neessary for you to see how far you were reallr compromised by the various untoward occurrnces which had befallen the bonk, the ironworks, the Gwn debt, X'Gregor's debt, Mullins% Olver's, and so on .-tr,Alder. an Kennedymnighthave made a remark to thateffet. -. Have you anydoubt that he did?-I do not know. Idoa not know why he should have made the remark, snore ihin any other director.
Itwas a s,bjct which ought to hive been In the mn:lds of all 9-I telyou again, for the third or fourth time, that. of course we all had anxieties prevailing on our minds.
I must repeat my question for the secnd time. Did Mr. Alderman Kennedy tell you in May, 1855, that it was im
pctiant that tho directors should see how far they were morpromised by the various untoward circumstances which hadhefallen thebank? 7-If hecdid soitisnotin myrecol. lection.
Did he, or not ?-I do not recolect.
Wil you swear he did ?-No, I will not swear that.
Was not your attention caUed before the half-yearly neetingof August, 1855, to the necessity of ascertaining the real deficit of bad debts i-It is very likely that I made the suggestion myself.
Did you follow it out ?-My acquaintance with the past due bills forwarded a good deal of informaation on that point.
But having, in all probability, made the suggestion your. elf that an inquiry was desirable, did you make that inq.iry s-I do not think that a special quiry was made on
Was any inquiry made ?-I do not think there was. I do not recollect it, at all events.
Was it saidto you in May, 1855, thattocallthe shareholder together and state the loss and obtain their acquiescence to relinquish the dividend, and whip up to restore lost capital, Alderman Kennedy would pronoance as simply puerile?I do not recollect the fact youname.
Do you recollect Mr. Alderman Kennedy telling you that it would not do to call the shareholders together, and ask them to forego the dividend and make up lost capital ?-I do not.
Wil you swear he did ?-I will swear that I have no recollection that he did.
Will you swear he did not 7-I should not like to be called upon to do that.
You will not swear that 7-No; it is out of my power to swear it.
Did you not say the better way was to get some good men npon the board, and then the pubhic would subscribe for 2,00 more shares ?-Not to tSe best of my recoUection, I sad so. I might have said that the junction of new men of greatsr power than ourselves would be of service to the
And you tried to get the men ?-Yes.
Were they taken in ?-Why, I don't know to whom you allude.
Any after that time ?-I do not know who joined us after that time. What date re you now upon?
I am giving you May, 1855. The unhappy Mr. Stapleton -the hon.-1 had not the pleasure of Mr. Stapleton's acquaintance before that time, but he was a most honourabin man.
What do you say, honourable7.-lIe was a most honourable man.
Quite so, but was he not designated in your prospectus "The Hon. Mr. Stapleton V"-I dare say he was, as he was the brother of Lord Beaumont, a most honourable man.
And this honourable man was let into the direction in July, 1855 7--He joined the direction in 1855-I believe he did at that time-not through me, if you intend to infer that. I wish he had been in the direction in 1850.
You had nothing to do with letting him into the direction ?-Not that I know of.
Not that you know of?-I believe I may say I did not. I did not know him before meeting him at the board.
Did you second him at the Board ?-Very likely. I may say I admit it.
You only admit these things when I show you I have the materials to prove them.-I only wish to state what is quite clear to my own mind.
Mr. V&NrLrG.-It is matter of want of memory. You have the facts on the books.
The Witness.-I have not any motive toconcealanything, Mr. Lin}later, and if I do hesitate it is because my memory is not tenacious enough to bring up the points you are upon. I had no motive to carry on the bank.
Is this correct that on the 24th of July, 1855, it was moved by hlr. 'CIoud, and seconded by the govermor, and unanimously agreed to, " that the Hon. J. Stapleton, of 55, South Audey-street, Grosvenor-square, be appointed a director of tk'e hank, in the place of Archer Spens, Esq. V" -I have no doubt of it at all
The governor at that time, by whom the nomination of Mr. Stapleton was seconded, was yourself ?-Yes, I suppose so, at that time, of course.
You say you had no motive for carrying on the bank?(isrtainly not, except for the good of the bank itself.
Were you aware that the responsibility of the directors Was a material consideration in carrying on the business of ;the bank.7-Ido not quite anderstand the drift of your remark.
Were you aware, supposing the bank to have come within the terms of the 71st clause in the charter, that the personal responsibility of the directors was pledged for losses ? -I believe they were responsible.
Then, in carrying on upon the responsibility of yourself and other directors, did you b3lieve yourself to be a man of substance at that time .-Not of substance.
If your debts had been paid at that time, Mr. Esdaile, were you solvent or not ?-The bank 7
You ?-Undoubtedly.
You were ?-Undoubtedly. My personal debts. Yes ?-Undoubtedly.
Aye! and debts to your firm or your father ?-That I do not say.
Mr. LLNKLATER.-Mr. Venning, you should not suggest anything to the witness.
Mr.AV7sN.LNG.-I suggested nothing; I said, " Wait a a minute."
Mr. LLSKL.ATEs.-Do you not call that suggesting7
Mr. VYLN iNG.-The witness was answering you too soon, and I think my remark was innocent.
The Witness.-I said, these are personal questions; you are right.
Mr. VMicNRe?.-And I was going to appeal to the Commissioner to know whether this ought to be prosecuted.
The Witness.-I cannot conceive what my personal debts have to do with it.
The CommisssioxEs.-When the question was whether you did or not carry on the bank upon the responsibility of the directors, of course it is a material question to see how far the directors were responsible, and how far they could mneet the responsibility they took upon themselves, supposing they come within the 71st clause.
Mr. VESLSN.-With great submission I should put it to you whether there is not a little misconception here; that clause alludes to the personal responsibility not in any other sense than that they would be committing a breach of the charter. It is not a pecuniary matter; it is a matter as to a breach of the charter. I doubt myself the relevancy of tbese inquiries.
Mr. LINKLATZP.-None are so blind as those who will mot see. It is important that the 71st clause should be known to Mr. Venning, who appears to be in ignorance of its meaning at the present moment. I need scarcely teRl your Honour it is a clause which says it is the bounden duty of the directors when they have lost one-fr. ;rth of their capital and reserved fund to call their shar olders together that they may see whether the bank shall be con. tinued or shaU be elosed.
Air. VZX-lING.-That is a matter of duty.
Mr. LLNKLATEP.-Then, do 1 take your answer that at that time, if all your debts were paid, you were insolvent ?- I was indebted to my father for my capital in my firm. If you call that a debt, of course I was indebted to him.
Did you not cal it a debt at that time ?-It was a debt.
Mr. VsENsNIG.-I really think it my duty to appeal to your Honour to know whether this is a course of examination that should be prosecuted ?
The ComzumossboxR.-I think, Mr. Linklater, you have got quite enough.
Mr. LLINKLATER.-Thereis one other question that I wish to ask with refererce to the personal conduct of Mr. Esdaile. On the 17th of September, 1856, you and the ,other directors of the bank made a call upon the share. holders of the remaining 501. per share. fs that so ?- Yes.
Have you paid one farthing of it ?-I have not yet.
Did you pay your father 4,0001. after the bank closed its doors ?-There was a transfer of my capital upon the books of my firm back to my father.
And was the amount of capital 4,000& ?-About. Of which he has the benefit ?-Yes.
Mr. VEN NL'iG.-Which was in his own hands before, and upon which he had a security. I think the whole facts should be stated if at all.
Mr. LLNKLATER.-We will examine you at any time you are ready, Mr. Venning.
Mr. VEXXINIG.-I am in the discharge of my duty as you are in the discharge of yours, and I will not be put down, although you are rather omnipovent here.
Mr. LIzKLrTER.-These are facts which ought to be piven upon oath and inquired into at the proper time.
Mrr. EN?sIs. -If you will afford me an opportunity of cross-examining the witness, I shaLl be content. I never saw such an examination in al my life.
Mr. LlDLnATER.-Well, now, Mr. Esdaile, in the month of January, 1856, were you proposing to retire yourself from the direction ?-I cannot say that I was.
Surely, the retirement of the governor of the Royal British Bank is a subject about which there can be no doubt. You ccasion the repetition of the question need. lessly by the mode in which you answer'-They are questions I ama not prepared to answer off-hand, you know.
January, 1856, is not very far away. I ask you whether in the month of January, 1856, you had intended to remign the office of governor of the Royal British Bank t-I might have had a wish to do so at that time.
Did you express thatwish to the court of directors, or to any person in its establishment ?-Yes, I think I did, bat what the motive at that time was I can hardly call to mind now. It was contained in a note that I wrrote.
Were any directors at that time refusingrto attend a
general meeting to be hold on the 1st of February, 1856the general meeting of shareholders ?-Now you bring the thig to my memory again. It was in consequence of one gentleman awho I suspected would not attend the meeting that induced me then to tender my resignation.
Did not that gentleman refuse to attend the general meeting because he thought the bank was in such a state ?- NO.
You did not hear my question-of insolvency, and he ought not to meet the shareholders ?-I think not; I cannot nay so.
I must ask you whether you will say that was not the reason that was assigned at the time ?-I have no recollection of that beiog assigned.
Will you say that was not the reason assigned?-I forget what the reason was.
Was Mr. Owen deputy-governor at the time ?-I believe he was;* I think so.
Did you tell him that the best way was to present a solid front to the public .-I have no recollection of those words sscaping my lips.
Did you not say so at that time7.-I do rnot know. I cannot recollect what I said.
Do you remember telling him that your weakest conduct 'Was to dangle a rope of sand before the shareholders ?-It mwould have been weak conduct.
Did you say so9- -I don't know.
Did you write it ?-I will not say.
Is that your letter (handing a letter to the witness) ?- jAfier looking) Yes.
Mr. LIaKLATsR.-It is a letter datedthol6th of January, 1856, from tbe Royal British Bank, No. 16, Tokenhouseyard, addressed to Mr. Owen, the deputy-governor of the bank.

Was that report the report circulated at the meeting of shareholders on the 1st of February, 1856, with your sanction ?-Yes.
As you were kind enoughto second the nomination of the lIon. Air. Stapleton as one of the directors of the bank, I suppose you took good care to tell him its positionbefore he joined ?-I cannot say that I did. I was not the party introducing him,
You merely helped him in ?-If you choose to apply the term.
Had you not taken care to ask whether Mr. Stapleton know of the losses the bank had made before he joined?I dare say I might havesaid to Mr. Cameron, who was the person introducing him, that I thought that Mr. Stapleton should know the circumstances of the bank.
You thought he should ?-Yes.
Did Mr. Cameron tell you that he had ?-That I do not know-I cannot bring that factto my mind.
But you are quite sure that you told Mr. Cameron that he ought to mention it to Mr. Stapleton ?-I think so.
Are you sure ?-No, I cannot swear to it?
Did yoa believe that you did .-I cannot say. Do you beheve that you did .-I cannot say.
I am asking you of your present belief 7-I think it is very probable that I did.
Do you believe that you did 7-I think I may say so. Do you beheve that you did ?-Yes. Positively 7-I think I may say so.
Is that your letter (handing a letter to the witness)?(After looking) Yes.
Mr. LieNiATER.-It is dated the 20th of February, 16, City Saw-mills, addressed to H. I. Cameron, Esq.
"My dar Si-Thee aresome " City Saw-mills, Feb. 20, ISMf
{ hfy dear 8ir,-There are somenmatters connected with the internal discpline of the bank with which the directors are not satisted, and they deem it expedient to confer with you on the subject before antoer gentleman altogether strange to the institution joins the board.
"Inlasmuch as Mlr. Staple0ton has, it appears, received Intimation that you are indebted to She bank without a(dequate securitybeing deposited to our hands, It is ounsidered only sight and consistent that these matters, affecting your psoition as the executive of the corporation and the peculiar cu3todier of its securities, should be (for the reaEOn just now assigned more particularbly adjusted.
A twelvemosh had elapsed aino these matters vvwere first mooted, because then first known, and I believe you will not impute any undue or indelicate pressure on this point, either to myself or colleagues, in

"Believe me, my dear Sir yours sincerely
"H.I. Cameron, Esq.'I"EDWAD DATLE, Governor. Now, that was dated in February, 1856 7-Yes.
In February, 1855, you had learnt that Mr. Canaeron wras largely indebted to the bank ?-Yes.
Nearly 20,0001. 7-Yes,
And that it had not been reduced up to February, 1856? -No.
And you did not tell Mr. Stapleton one word about it when he joined in Februar, 156?-I really cannot recolleot the circumstance whether I did or not.
I am asking you, did you or did you not toll Mr. Stapleton, before he came into the direction in July, 1855, that Mr. Cameron was indebted to the bank7.-No, certainly not.
Was the 71st clause brought forward at any other time in the year 1856, do you zemember ?-I dare say it was referred to subsequently.
The last half-yearly meeting took place on the 1st of Aungust, 1856, did it not 9.-Yes.
Hiad the subject been mentioned before the court of directors that it was desirable to consider the 71st clause, and call the sharebolders together 7.-It might have been a matter of conversation.
But was it or not?-Very po8sibly, I think; I cannot speak to the fact, but possibly it was.
Was it a matter of serious deliberation before the court of directors before the Ist of August, 1856, that the 71st clause applied to their position ?-I dare say it was, but I do not know the fact.
Do you know-do you believe it was ?-I can easily believeit might have been.
Was it a subject of serious consideration .-You ask about mnatters of fact, but I will not give answers from my recollection.
Because the minute-book is here ?-No, not because of that.
Mr. VxENicG.-These questions are unfair. The witness has a bad memory on the subject.
MSr. LLm-:LATTR.-Now, on the 10th of June, 1856, you were the governor, and in the chair of the court of directors on that day ?-Yes.
And is it true that on that day the general manager, Mr. Cameron, also caUed attention to the 71st clause of the charter, and considered the expediency of submitting the question whether the affairs of this bank were brought within its operation; after some discussion the matter was postponed ',-If it is there I have no doubt it is the case.
And being there, you have no doubt it is the case t-No. But you went on to your general meeting, that of August, 1856?-Yes.
That represented the bank as being solvent-the report produced at that meeting ?-I presume that was the inference to be drawn from it.
And that more than ordinary provision had been made for bad debts ? Is this the report (handing it to the wit. ness) 7.-(After looking) I suppose so; yes, June, 1856.
And this is the report which, as I understand you, was circulated at the half-yearly meeting of the proprietors of the bank, held on the .st of August, 1856. You were present at that meeting 7-Yes; the general meeting.
Yes ?-Yes.
And the shareholders were kind enough to pass a vote of confidence in the directors7.-In the honourable intention of the directors, in the personal rectitude of the directors, I make that distinction; they could not feel confidence in a concern about which so many rumours were spread ; and if ther are an shareholders present, they will bear me out
lIad you no confidence in the concern before the 1st of Ahugtust, 185.6.7-We were not prepared to stop the bank.
You state the shereholders had no confidence in the concern at the meeting of the 1st of August, 1856 7-I do not say that they had no confidence, though many things were mooted at that meeting which must have impaired their confidence; but they did express a resolution to the effect thati they had confidene in the present integrity of the men
The report to be presented. to the proprietors on the 1st of August is in these terms:-

"Tueremvalof te tiefoffie t Theadeedle-street, though retaredbeon te erodanicpaed,ha aredyben ttndd it
That you found the deposits were coming in rapidly7The business of the bank.
An important change?-It could mean nothing else. I am not aware that the bank could have any other business except receiving deposits.
There is another duty in paying, then ?-Yes.
I observe you say then that Camneron has retired. Why did you not say that Mr. Cameron had been removed 7- We said that he had retired.
Will you answer me? Had not Mr. Cameron been displa^ed by the directors ?-Yes.
Whydid not you tell the shareholders so on the 1st of August, 1856 ?-For a very patent and very good reason.
Is it convenient to give it7-We did not choose to attract the public notice to the fact that the directors had been dissatisfied, or had any reason to be dissatisfied, with their
general manager. lf we had- Mr. Linklater, my answer is the same to all these questions-if we had acted in this, that, or the other way, in which way you say we ought to have done, the bank would have been a lost concern. We were not prepared to close it. We ought to have done so, you say; but, using our judgment to the best of our ability, we did not, because it would havebeen suicidal for us to declare this, that, or the other, which would have increased the distrust whieh had been fomented by the attacks of some members of the press, That is the general answer that I must make to all these questions. We were not, with tEe informationat that time, prepared to bring the bank to a close. Whateould we do?
Were the resolutions passed at the meeting of the 1st of August trinted and circulated among the proprietors of the bank 7-7 .e*ieve so. I know nothing to the contrary.
You spoke to a resolution with reference to the personal honour and in tegrity of the directors 7-Yes.
This is the form adopted-"It was moved by iAeutenant. General Aitcheson and seconded by the Rev. James Rushton, and resolyed unanimously, that the directors do poseess
thekfull confideiie of the shareholders!"-It was intendea in that restricted sense.
Assuming other aense was intended than that which was expresaed?-No. It was intended for the personal 'onour of the directors.
Why did not the report say so ? It is extremely important. Up to the half-yearly neeting of the ist of August. 1856, I believe the reports presented to the meeting had been generally signed by the general manager, had it got 7- I dare say that was the form.
Have you any doubt about it ?-The fast is not contrary to my mind.
It is not present to your mind .-No.
Just refer-take any one. Do you fnd that to be the general fora ?-9-Yes.
Itis something more than a form, is it not, that a general manager of a bank should sign itsreprt9-Yes.
Now, will you tell me how is it that this report of the 1st of August, 1856-pray pausehbefore you answer this queston-how is it that the report wyas signed by no oneo1 do not know why it was noS done in the usual form by Mr. Cameron.
Did you not try to get some one of your establishment to sign it 7.-Not that I recollect.
Try and reeollect.-No. I mean to say so.
That you did not 1.-I have no recollection of the fact; nor can I believe that MIr. Crawford would have objected
Wais Mr. Crawford asked by you to sign?2-I do not know. Will you swear he was not ?-I have no recollection.
He was the general manager ?-Yes. I have no recolle. tion that he made any objection, nor have I any recolection that it was asked.
Was not your attention called to the absence of All signatures to that report of August 7.-Not at this moment.
Was not the secretary, Mrt. Paddison, asked to put his hand to that, and did he not refuse 7.-I have no recollection
Mr. Paddison being there, wUi you undertake to say it was not so l-I will swear-that I have no recollection of it.
Will you swrear, to your knowledge, that his refusal was notgiven then .'-Yes; I beUieve I may say so.
will you swear that 7.Yes ;I think so. Will you 7.-Pat the question again.
Did yout know before the general meeting of the 1st of August, 1866, that Mr. Paddison had refused to sign that report ?-Actmg upon my present recollection, I may distinctly say that I had no knowledge of it.
Yoa wil not. swear it 7.-I will sear s to my having no reeollection.
That is easily done.-I wiU swear as to my impression.
I am asldng you whetber your recoUection is suficient to enable you to swear positively that you did not know before the general meeting that MIr. Paddison had refused to sign that report ?-I have no recollection of it at all.
That is not my question. Wil you swear positively that you did not know it 1-I should not like to swear to that which may be brought back to my recollection through any other channel; bun at the present moment I can honestly say I have no recollection of Mr. Paddison refusing to
Willyon or vill you not swear positively upon the subject ?-No, I decline to swear in the absence of all belief.
Did you, during the months of June and July endeavour to get ;ersona to buy shares in the bank ?-I should think it was improbable at that time.
I should have thought so, too. But did yon not, in the months of June and July, 1856, endeavour to get persons to buy shares in the Royal British Bank ?-Ihave no recollection of it. I do not think, to the best of my present recollection, that I was ever a party to introduce a shareholder to the establishment, to the best of my recollection.
I will give you an instance of the consequences of what you have done. Do you know this gentleman, Mr. Goddard, who is now a bankrupt ?-I have seen that gentleman before.
Do you remember having an interview with Mr. Goddard in the month of July last'-I dare say I did.
Look at him and see ?-I have no doubt about it. You never saw him before ?-I dare say I did.
Now, try if you can bring your mind to an interview which you had with MIr. Goddard in the month of July last year 7-Perhaps you wiU just enlighten me.
I would rather take your answers-it is important to youa7-I might not. I cannot say whether I have only on,ce or not seen Mr. Goddard.
Do you remember having seen Mr. Goddard at all before the general meeting of August, 1856-Yes.
In the bank 9Y
Did Mr. Goddard tell you he was a shareholder ?-I knew that he was.
Did he tell you that he had recently purchased four shares at a discount in the market ?-I believe he did.
Did he tell you that he had been offered some more shares at a discount, but that he was very uneasy7.-He might have done so.
Did he ask you if you could account for the depression in the market value of the shares ?-Very likely he might have.
Very likely, Mr. Esdaile ?-I may say I believe he did.
Did you tell him there was no cause for the depression at all?-I cannot say; I should think not.
Will you swear you did not s-I should think I did not. I will swear thatI thinkI did not.
Did he toll you that a MEr. Henry Smith had offered him 16 shares at 34 discount 7.-I have no recolection of it ?
Did you not speak in the most flattering terms of the petition of the bank at the time ?-I should think not.
I should have thought that y(u would have known that. I ask you whether you do not know you did not ?-I do swear.
You are not alone.-I believe I may swear. Do you ?-I believe so.
Do you ?-Just repeat that question.
Did you not, when you sawv Mr. Goddard in the bank in July, 1856, speak in flattering terms of the position of the bank at that time ?-My present impression is that I could not have so spoken.
No man knows better than you that I am asking you here upon your oath-I ask you, upon your oath, did you not speak in flattering terms of the hank 9.-I cauot say.
Will you swear you did not7.-Mr. Holroyd, I cannot swear to that which is not p resent to my mind.
The CO3AIiiuSsrOxnZ.-If you are unable to swear it,
h Ir. L TNPE -Youwill not swear ?-No.
Did you not say that your new appearance in the South Sea-house would bring you great additional custom?. I might have said it was bringing us additional custom.
And that you had opened very large accounts recently! -That I have no recolecetion of.
No recollection ! No fire insurance companies ?-I think not.
You will give me the answer thatyou will not pledge your word ?-No.
Did not you tell him that if he would go into the market and buy shares the bank would lend him 1,0001. and take his acceptance for the amount ?-I believe I did say so
Yoknew Mlr. Goddard to be a highly respectable man? A hard woridng and industrious tradesmau?-Yes.
Wbo had saved a httle money ?-I did not profess to know anythmng of br. Goddard's private affairs, hut I looked upon him as a respectable man.
You believed him to be a substantial maui?-Yes.
Did he not tel you he was not a rash man7-I do not
But if he could see his way clear he did not mind going in and buying ?-He might have said so.
Youaplace yourself at a disadvantage by not giving me direct answers to the question; I assure you you do, however unintentionally 7.-I must accept the incoavenience, as I wiLl not state what I cannot speak to.
Imention that as a prelude to this question. Did not Mr. Goddard say to you, that presuming the worst to befal the bank that could happen to it-namely, if they had a run upon it-could he rest assured that all he could possibly lose would be the money he had invested in the purchase of shares.-I have no recollection of his saying so.
You will not swear that he did not say so to yout7-I should not like to say that.
Did you not hold up your hands and exclaim with astonishment, " Is it possible that you can conceive anything so bada'-No; it was very unlike me to do so.
Did you or did you not ?-I should say not.
Will you swear it ?-I think I may swear it.
I tell you againyou were not alone. Will you swear it? -I might have held up my hand ; but it is impossible for me to answer these minute things that had happened in a private conversation in this way.
Then, you will not swear it 7-No.
Did not Mr. Goddard tell you that he could not suppose things were so bad when he heard what you told him and looked at your last half-yearly report.7-I do not recollect that observation.
Will you swear he did not say so l-No, I will not. I will not swear that.
Did you advise him to buy shares7-I might have advised him to buy shares in that particular way.
Which ?-By offering to lend him money. Well, did you9.-Did we lend him money!9
Did ou dvis hi tobuy hars, oux offering to lend him money to do ao-I Ithinky aht trhe,time did.I think I suggested that he would serve the hank by doing so.
Serve the hank by doing so, and ruiu hn s-I do not say Was it in this way,-"Do not buy as cheap as you can, but as dear as you can. You are interested in keeping up the bank; youL are a, shareholder; you willby d(oing so support the market. Do not be under any misapprehen. aion; it wil be a source of profit to you ?'-That was my
beief at the time, of course.
Did you say so 9-I might have said so. Did you'.-I da,re .say I didA__
st ave you any doubt about it ? -No.
See how many questions you make me put for an answer. -Mygeneral asNver to all that is this :-Up to that time we had never speculated as a corporation in our own shares. Listen to what I say, Mr. Linklater.
.Ifpray you not to repeat it.-My observation do-es not apply to the taking upof shares presented to us under pecnliar circumstances. We did not speculate in the -pe
marketup to that time with the shares of the henk, but up to that timo it rgwas ou ggted to us out of doors that if the market c supported in a legitimate way at that particular time it would be of signal advantage to us in checking the depreciation which 'was then beginining. That was the MOtive for my saying what I did toMrf. Goddard, and I believe he is the only personi to whom I did say so. s - I cannot expect you to put
down your own money, but if you have no objection to take p sThares, is our confidence in Your respectability that
wail avace yot a certaitn sum of money to enable you to do A)." That I eleveI maygsay.
Upo.n the subject of the BankE dealing with shares I shall have much to say hereafter to you.-I only want to show you the motive of the transaction with M1r. Goddard. If yon intend to infer that I intentionally believed that T was
p maig Mr 'otadinx a position by which he woulcl be damnifieal distincely deny it.
After this convem%tion with Mr. Goddard had finished, did you call Mr. CaLesrOin into the room-the general manager s -Imight have.
He was then in debt to t hebhak in a -m of 25,000o, Was he not.5 -Upon all the accoun'ts, yes.
Do you remember MEr. Camt -on layinghiS hand upon your shoulder and saying, "M y dear Sir, Mr. GoeAard is a re-
petable man and can cmmai'14 i,02. i0 gA when he
lkes T'-He might bavhe so.
Was that after you had told. Mr. Camaeron yon had promised to lend }r. Goddard 1,001. ?-I do not know.
You do not know?-No. I suppose it was, or there wou'd have been no proper relation to the question.
Mr. Crawford ws the accountant of tho bank, was he not ?-Yes. What date are you speaking of?
July, 1856.-Mr. Ca6neron must have left us then.
am speaing of the bank in July.-He was then in tbe bank.
Was Mr. Crawford the accountant at tob time 7-Yes.
Do you remember Mr. Crawford coming into the zoom9No; I cannot say that I do, but verv likely he did.
Just try and recoLlect whether Mr. Crawford did not come into the room, and say that he also had the pleasure of knowing Mr. Goddard very wvelL-Very likely he did; I do not recollect it.
YouL do not recollect it ?-No.
I belfeve Mr. Goddard apologized for occnpying so much of your time, and you begged he would not mention it ?- I do not recoLect it.
And that you would be happy to tee him at all times?I might have said so, as I should have done to any other customer of the bank.
Or any intended purchaser of shares'.-To anybody with whom we had buaiuess.
We have had your report presented to the half-yearly meeting in the month of August. Do yotL know Mr. Louis Marcus 7-Yes.
He was a shareholder, was he not ?-Yes, and a depositor, I believe.
And one of the gentlemen who presented a petition to wind you up ?-I believe so.
Do you remember, after the 1st of Auguist, asking Mr. Marcus to go into the market to buy shares ?-In the same way as MIr. Goddard?
I do not know about the same way. Did you 7-Yes, I might have done so.
You sent for Mr. Marcus, a sharcholder, and you asked him to go into the market and buy shares in the bank, did you offer to lend hina money to buy them 7-I believe we did to a certain amount.
Do you remember any amount being mentioned?-No, I do not. We looked upon Mr. Miarcus as a substantial man.
Of thousands7.-I should think not.
Mr. Marcus would not do it7.-I said just now that I believed Mr. Goddard was the only person to whom I made that proposition. I remember now that 3Mr. Marcus was another. There were only one or two.
But do I understand you to say positively that they were all?-I think so.
Will you swear it9.-I think so. I have no Tecollection of any others.
You will not swear positively that there were not more? -I should not like to do so.
I may trouble you with somebody another day. Do you remember Mr. Cameron, the general manager, being in the north of England hunting up shareholders about the end of June, 1856 7-No.
I speak advisedly.-Not at all.
You did not know he was there for any such purposo about that time.-Not at alL
Try, Mr. Eadaile.-In the north of England?
In the north of England orin Scotland.-I know he visited Scotland.
Not among his Scotch friends 7-No; I did not know that he went to Scotland with any business object at all.
Did you not write to hin there "to hunt up the game?' -I do not know. I should think not. I do not think so.
Was be not trying to get SirJames Mattheson as a director as well as a trustee ?-At that time he was.
I have mislaid that letter of yours. It is rather an odd expression Do you not recollect writing to him something aboutthe 'game" that he was to bring down ?-I do not know. If I did he was then gone upon a shooting excarsion.
And had he not gone to Sir James Matheson 7-I think it is very unfair, Mr. Linl;later, to apply an ordinary remark of this kind, one gentleman writing to another confidentially, by distorting it to another object.
You may call it a " distortion" if you like, but I wll call it " hunting up shareholders l"-You did not say " huntirgup shareholders-you said " hunting up game." My impression is that the use of that term had no reference at all to any business object of his visit to Scotland.
Do you recollect the term.7-I do not; it is a term I should very likely use.
I will go into the aubject of the shares at anotber time. You told as in your last examination that until you opened that " green pocket lodger," called " the house ledger," after Mr. Cameron left in February, 1855, you did not know Mr. Humphrey Brown was a debtor to the bank 7-Until that time.
Yes.-I believe so.
You did not know it. Do you remember at the general meeting of proprietors?-" Did not know he was a debtor to the bank?"
Yes.-I think not. I think I mnst have said I did not know that he had advanced upon shipping securities up to that time. I did say that I did not know he was a debtor.
I will refer you to your last examination.-If I did it was a wirong term.
I thought it was singular at the time.-I maeant to say that I did not knowt that he had made any advance apon shipping securities, and I think I stated so in my examina-
You attended the general meeting of shareholders on the 20th of September, 1856?-Yes.
Did you tell them at that time that you did not know that Mx. Hamphery Brown was a debtor to the bank until you assumed the chair in February, 1855 ?-I do not know, I am sure. If it is properly recorded, I submit to it.
I understand you'now to say that before February, 185, you did know that Mr. Humphrey Brown was a debior to the bank ?-I think I must have upon the lth of January.
I ask you whether you did not tell the proprietors at the meeting of the 20th of September, 1856, that until you assmed the chair at the request of your brother directors in 1855 you did not know that Mir. Humphrey Brown was in debt to the bank at all?-I might have said so.
You may have said so. Have you any doubt that you did?-I do not know whether I worded my communication to that effect.
Was it intended to convey that meaning7-It was intended to convey the meaning that I did not know that he was indebted upon securities which we regarded as of an unsafe character.
And that is what yon intended to convey in words ?-I should say so.
That you did not know that Mr. Humphrey Brown was In debt to the bank at all-do give me an answer 7-I can hardly conceive that I should be justified in saying that.
You think you were not justified in saying what yoa did to the shareholders?-Not now that it is brought home to my recollection; he mnst have had transactions on the 12th of January.
Now, did you hear Mr. Owen state at that meeting of the 20th of September, 1856, that it was not until after Mr. Cameron went, and you assumed the chair, that the directors were aware that Mr. Brown was indebted to tho bark, and they found that he owed the bank 70,0001. Do you remember Mr. Owen making that statement?No, I do not.
It is rather an important one. I wiU just see if I can recaU your memory to the fact. Did not he eay that until after Mr Cameron left in February, 1855, you and he never knew of a private book which had been kept by Cameron, and that not a single director knew of its existence before Mr. Cameron left? Do not you recollect his saying so ?- He might have said so.
It was not true, was it ?-As to the 70,0001. ?
No; as to any director having seen that green ledger before Cameron left in February 7-I will not say that it was not true.
Was it true9.-You know what I have said with regard to my own knowledge of transactions that took place in February, 1855.
You did not contradict Mr. Owen at the meeting, I believe ?-I presume not.
You did not ?-No.
Did he not then sav that it was then, for the first time that the directors ascertained that MIr. Humphrey Brown was indebted to the bank to the amount of 70,0001. ?-He might have said so.
And you did not contradict him 7-That was not until some little time afterwards, after I found that there were certain securities of Mr. Brown when I assumed the chrir.
That is what I want to know. I believe when you assumed the chair Mr. Humphrey Brown was indebted to the amount of 23,0001. to the bank-7-Perhaps he might have been.
And when the hank closed its doors he owed the bank, without regard to securities, 75,0001. ?-Without regard to securities?
Yes; 75,0001., against which the bank would hold certain securities; that was so7-Yes.
You told us on the last occasion that you objected to the nature of the securities which had been taken with reference to Mr. Walton's debt ?-Yes.
How could it be the same kind of securities? You allowed Mr. Brown's debt to be increased from 23, 0001. to 75,0001..7-They were the same advances,but transferred from MIr. Walton's account to Mr. Brown's account.
Do you mean to say that after you became governor the bank adopted Mr. Brown as their debtor, and let ont Mr. Walton, thegovernor?--Yes, it was necessaryto do so, in order to obtain the ships themselves-the ship property. For all these facts I may refer to Mr. Paddison, as they are completely in his recollection as to the mortgagee we then received. 9
Nowv, perhaps you will tell me when you first became aware that Mr. HIumphrey Brown owved thebakayhn'
-I *m not prepared to say that it w as before Itook the chair in 1855, altaough the circumstances which induced us to look into Mr. Walton's account must necessarily have brought to light the connexion of Mr. Brown's name with the bills. I don't know. I am not clear upon that point.
Now, I observe, by Mr. Brown's pass-took, that in February, 1855, hig overdrawn account was somewhere about 10,0001. or 12,0001. ?-I think 13,0001.
But duringyour management as governor of the bank I think that account had increased so as to leave a balancoe overdrawvn 3,8001 ?-That admits of great explanation. In order to obtain those securities, which we could not get into our hands, upon the ships themselves and their freights we were obliged to release Mr. Walton from his co-obligation upon the bis and to transfer at the same timethebiUsto Mr. Humphrey Brown's account, upon the further condition that we should relieve Mr. Walton from that co-obligation that he had with Mr. Brown before he would consent to make those transfers. And it was the taking up of those co-obligations of Mr. Walton's and Mr. Brown's,pn the strength of the shipping securities, about 60,0001., that accounts for the apparent snerease of the drawing account.
But had you not transferred to a convertible security's account of Mr. Brown's sums amounting to 40,0001. ?-Very likely the account was so treated.
But the drawing account ?-Mr. Crawford will give you th6 best answer to that.
Now, MIr. Humphrey Brown was largely indebted to the bank in February, 1855; did you not talke any trouble to lookat his pus-book ;ccont?-j had theao tconstantly before me.
And you sawvit contluacingto inerease ?-Yes; but not in the way in which you would lead rr. Holroyd 'to infer. They were incresasng .in a way that we eotld -not avoid.

ships that were afloat, Charges upon ships conang home andegingf Out had to be paid, and that nweessaily swelled the debit of that account That hAt0 relieve63fr. Walton from his obligation, no doubt, with the light we have upon the value of the securities so far as they have been realized, nor ought that stipulation to have been mnade by Mr. Walton, as he ws a co-obligant upon those bills.
I have now the letter to which &rnelfeurred a short time back which I had rislaid forthe moment. I am now going back as to Mr. Cameron. I ask you whether at the end of 1855 Mr. Cameron was not in the north looking up shareholders ?-I do nut know that ho was in the north looking up shareholders. He was on a visit to Sir Jame, Matheson.
Did you in September, 1855, know that Mr. Cameron was in the north for the purpose of getting an accension to the names of shareholders osf tho bank -I cannot say that I know that. I know he was upona visit to LordMacdonald, and it was lkely when he wasin Scotland he would see Sir James !datheson, and he would speak to him about the strength of our direction.
Canyon say you did notknow thathe vas there for that purpose'.-I c2annot say that; it might have been very probable that he would have taken the advantage of anoc casion to do soo
Is that your letter (handing a letter to the witness) ?- Yes. You will understand, Mr. Linklater, that this is a strictly private letter. I think private letters ought not to be paraded before the public.
I amafraid when a bank or any other person becomes bankrupt it is our duty to expose all that may throw a light upon any conspiracy-" Any conspiracy l"
Yes; that may throw a ight upon any conspiracy; that tsthe utyof thelaw, You ianto the oSservatton.-It is a strong term to use.
It is not un justiied. This is a letter, dated the 17th of September, 1855, from Mr. EdaiCo to Mr. Cameron -

YoTu k-now there were large transactions between them? -Yes.
And I understand yon to say that Mr. Hlumphrey Brown was a debtor to Mr. Walton in a very contsiderable sum, for which he held first mortgages upon certain ships 2-Yes.
Then the bank desired to get bold of the first mortgages, and made arrangements with Mr. Walton for paying off his claims and retiring all sums for which Mr. Humphrey Brown was liable2 Thatris-what raunders fmnd.-Yes.
And by that means the bank assumed that they had got into their possession securities sufficient to cover all that amount and the raorgt-es as wellie-Yes.

Now, tS Z r h get,y oveg those hie ships, they
did not register their security at the Cnstom-house 7t-No not the Glocester ships.
What became of the ships?-They were all out on tseif voyages, and some of them ha bee reaized bymr.Browi I believe, without-
I want to know whbt became of those five ships?-I MM tell you. Some of them ha been rdaisea yMIFJ HIumphrey Bro7an unknownu to the directors, on accoullt of their not having been registered at Glocester. Re had the. control of tho ships, but which ot them had boereredi;tea do not know.
Do I understand yon to say although Mr. Brown h%4 pledged these ships with the bank that he had afterd* disposed of them without the xaction of the bank?-I11
was so.
Do you know which vessels they were ?-I may state thEwhole reason. You may say it was an injudicious thing t,act in conformity with his request, but he did wish us toabstLin from transferring the ships into the name of an offl
cer of the ban], at Gloceater, because he did not wish hiSlocal position to be interfered with or his credit either, upon the undertaking that when they reached a British portI he would see that they were duly transferred into out names.
Instead of seeing that they were duly registered in youe name, what became of the Glooester ships --Some of thenm, have been since realized.
When did that fact first come to the knowledge of *1* directors 7-I cannot speakas to the exact date.
When did the fact first come to the knowledge of theF directors ?-It must have been, I suppose, in the spring og
The fact that they had been improperly dealt with ?-On@' or two ef them.
Do you recollect which vessels they were? I think yosE are under a misapprehension, and ? am anxious that yoi
should not make a mistake.-The fact is, at all events, thaf. Eome of the ships were realized unknown to the bank, an4 therefore the bank has not had the benefit of them.
Did not that fact become known to the bank before Au+ gust .-Before August, 1856 ?
Yes.-It must have been.
But you aTe stating it from your own recollection; ther* is no doubt of the fact7-Yes.
But it is contrary to my information.-One ship, at al} ev7nts, must have been reported to us as having been.
Do you recollect which that was ?-I do not rem4inbe the name. I think you have got the names of th.,thipl upon the paper?
Yes.-One vessel's name was afterwards altered, I believej I think it was the Madonna. There is the word " old'' against it in pencil, but what the date of that sale was E Cannot discern.
If Mr. Humpbrey Brown sold the ship which he hal pledged to the bank, 1 suppose he paid the money to the bank?-Ini one instance he did.
Which was that 7-I am afraid I can say in only one in; stance, but I think that will appear in the books; but' however, my imDression is that one of the ships was realize,
and accounted for, but no, such of the others as had beer. Fold.
You mean one out of the five only 1-Yes, one out of thofive.
Has the bank had only the benefit of one out of the fivd ship 5-_A t present.
Why do you say " at present?'X Where are the othet four?7-I think the Bride is stilD afloat unsold.
Yes, hut mortgaged for 3,0001.7-We knew nothing about that. I think it is Mr. Harding that we heard itP
Was the Bride mortgaged, do you know, for 3,0uOl, t- lIr. Hartland on the 10th of August, 18559-Not to us,' We did not know the fact. That did not transpire until after. 55 ni
You were not a CoDsenting party ?-Certainly not.
The bank did not consent to that mortgage?-Certainly not. My impression is that the fact of the 3,u0o. mortage. at first transpired from Mr. Hlarding since the closing of 1hebank.
I see the Wasp was mortgaged for 1,0001. to Mr. Kendal on the 5ith of June by lr. umphrey Brown.-That wer know nothing about.
Was not that done with the sanction of the bank7.-4 No.
Are you quite sure ?-Most decidedly.
The Madonna was sold ?-Yes we were very much alarmed'; because it was a niortgage of great personal trustbetween ua* and Mr. Humphrey Brown, that we should be obliged todefer the transfer of the property into our names till they should have completed their voyages. I am now talking ot the five Glocester ships.
Do you rememberan interviewthat tookplace in the montli of August, 1856, in the court, when the subject of theRoyal Brown was mentinned, the sale of her ?-I do not recoUect. It was the Mary White at first, her name was changed after. wards; it was the same ship.
Do yous remember Mr. Crawford sending down a tele. graphuc message to Glocester to ascertain if the vessel was clear in August, 1854 ?-I don't knowr.
Do you not recollect Mr. Brown being there ?-I believe rtwvas so; I think you are right.
It is your own aatementl-I think Mr. Crawford was present when that statement was made.
Perhaps this will call it to your recollection. I observe you have stated that the answer from Glocester was thab the ship was mortgaged, and that Mr. Crawford handed tho letter to you at the board. Do you recoDect that now ?-F think so.
Do you recollect asking Mr. Brown ?-I am not quite sure whether the telegraphic message was not in itse pu before me.
Do you recollect asking Mr. HumEphrey Brown whether the vetsel was clear?-That was not in 1854.
In August, 1856 ?-Yes. I distinctly recollect it.
Did you ask Mr. Brown whether the vessel was clear?Yes.
What did he say ?-He replied in the afrirmative.
Though you had a telegraphic message to say that the vessel was jmortgaged 7-Yes.
Did it turn out that it was mortgaged9?-Yes.
Then the only benefit the bank has derived from these five vessels is, as I understand you to say, from the saleof one 7-Oh, no, there are the other ships.
But as to the five Glocester ships ?-I believe only one -the Madonna.
Mr. Ls?ataTv-Sir, I am sorry to say I have not physical strength to continue tho examination to-day. E ought not to have been here. I ought to have been in bed; instead of being here. I am obliged to ask your Honour to indulge me by breaking off at this moment. I should not have been here exceptfor the importance of the occasion, knowing how many persons were likely to be present. i should certainly, under no circumstances, have been here
but I endeavoared to do what I could rather than have noexamination at all. Perhaps your Honour will adjourn it to this day week ?
The Co rtrssio.\M-Under those circumstances it must stand over to Wednesday.
Mr. LI2-KLAThR.-At 11 o'clock.
Mr. ELLIS.-Sir, I appear on behalf of Mr. Walton's family, and I understand I shall have an opportunity at tha next meeting of giving any explanation with reference to some of those matters which have been spoken to with respect to Air. Walton's connexion with the bank. Weshal explrin everything to the entire satisfaction of the Court and everybody.
The ComNuqISSboN;.-Tbere is no objection to that.
Mr. LrXiRLATERL-f certainly have no objection to that; indeed, I shalU be most happy.
Mrr. ELLIS.-I should have been glad to have the opportunity now of going into it, as it would be more con. venient. We can explain it with reference to MIr. Waltors if your Honour will give us the opportunity of doing so on the next occasion, so that there should be no misrepresentation or misunderstanding.
Mr. LiNqKLATER.-Mr. EUls will understand I am anxious not to do anything unkind or unfair to anybody. Perhaps it would be better that the explanation should be given at the moment; then the explanation would go with the charge, if there be any; but I have made none.
Mir. ELLIS.-Generally speaking, Mir. Esdaile esplainel the circumstarces which I w ished to get at, hut there havebeen some statements made about the letter which I have not seen. As far as I have learnt, Mr. Walton was suffering from a very serious ilness and was confined to his bed. There are matters which I cannot explain, but I have no doubt we. shall set aU this right as to any matter writtem or done, and I may say now, if Mr. Linldater will give me leave to say, the five mortgages about which there has beea inquiry were none of them of ships received from Mr. Walton.
Mr. Lw1KLATE?.-.No, none of them.
Mr. ELLrs.-It was stated that they were registered, w& had nothing to do with that. The securities that passedi from Mr. Walton were aU registered as good securities.
Mr. LiniLmtmrg-The ships were of great value 9
Mr. ELLIs.-Yes, of very much larger value than theamount paid to us. There is a representation among the papers from Mtr. H. Brown, but which I think is. in the handwvriting of MEr. Walton, stating that the ships are of the gross value with their freights of 60,0001., the tota! liabilities beimg 33,0001. and 12,000l.,-5,OOOl. together in
Mr. Paddison.-Allow me to ask whether I a;n no*correct in my impression that you have it in evidence thati the non-registration of the Glocester ships was the result or an rrangement between the directors and Mr. H. Brown himself?
Mlr. IIXKLATX5s-Yes. It is a transaction in whicht Mr. Paddison was in no way culpable. I think I should state that possibly it was an act with which the solicitor o- secretary had nothing to do.
hir. Paddison.-Juat so.
The COMasISSIONxx.-That undertaldng from Mr. Browi was not communicated to you at all to get the ships registered ?
lr. Paddison.-That was an agreement which I was instructed by the directors to prepare between themselves. and Mr. Brown.
The Coussio.sxL-I wonder you did not adviseupon it.
Mr. Paddison.-The directors kneow perfectly well the risk they would run. That was explained to them bS mayself.
The Co,nassgoxXR.-It was resolved on by the direc. tors, but prepared by you?
Mr. Paddison.-Preclsely so. The instructions weregiven by them to me.

TO THE EDITOR OF THIE TIMES.t
Sir,-In your edition of the 9th Inst. "C. P. M.* on tb6 abovo subject states that by a balloon being brought near to the fire an "explosion took place which destroyed a pane of lass and filUed the reom ith soot." As this state aent might somewhat damage the sale of them, we shal
feel obliged if you will insert this in contradiction,as wo bet to state tht they are perfectly haess, and it would b impossible for any damage to ensue -at any rate to the extent mentioned; and, should.any person have doubts of out sttement wre shall feel pleased at any time for im tG visit our factory and have ocular demonsrtion.
We are. 8ir. vour obedient nerans
