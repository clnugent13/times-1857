The Law Of Divorce*.
T:Et LAW OF DIVORCE,.
"Prisoner," said Mr. Justice Maule, addressing a, convicted culprit, who stood trembling in the dock before him-
" Prisoner, yoa have been convicted upon clear evidence. You have intermarried with another woman, your lawful wife being stiUl alive. You have committed the crime of bigamy. Yon teU me, and indeed the evidence has shown, tbat your first wife left your home and her young children to live in adultery with another msn. Youa say this prosecution is an instrument of extortion on the part of the adulterer. Be it so. I am bound to teUl you that these are circumstances which the law does not in your case take note of. You had no right to take the law into your own hands. Every BEglishman is bound to know that when a wrong is done the law, or perhaps I should rather say the constitution, affords a remedy. Now, listen to me, and I will tell you what you ounht to have done. Immediately you heard of your wife's adiatery you should have gone to an attorney and directed him to bring an action against the seducer of your wife. You should have prepared your evidence, instracted counsel, and proved the case ia court; and recollect that it was imperative that You should recover, I do not mean actually obtain, substantial damages. Having proceeded thus far, you should have employed a proctor and instituted a suit in the Ecclesiastical Courts for a divorce a mensd et thoro. Your case is a very clear one, and I doubt not you would have obtained your divorce. After this stop your course was quite plain. You had only to obtaina private act of Parliament todissolveyour marriage. This you would get, as a matter of course, uon payment of the proper fees and proof of the facts. You might then have lawfully married again. I perceive, prisoner, that you appear scarcely to understand what I am saying to you, but let me assure you these steps are constantly taken bypersons who are desirous to dissolve at unhappy marriage. It is true, for the wise man has said it, that ' a hated woman, when she is married, is a thing that the earth cannot bear,' and that ' a bad wife is to herhlsband as rottenness to his bones.' You, howvever, must bear this great evil, or must adopt the remedy prescribed by the constitution of your country. I see you would tell me that these proceedigs would cost you 1,0001., and that al your smal stock in trade is not v;orth 1001. Perhaps it may so be. The lawv has vnothing to say to that If you had taken these proceedingsyou would havebeen free from your present wife, and the womau whom you havesecondly married would have been a respectable matron. As you have not done so, you stand there a convicted culprit, and it is my duty to pa sentence upon you. You wil be imprisoned for one day."
This judgment was much commented upon by th bar of the Oxford Cirouit at the time it was delivered, and we have, perhaps, given but an imperfect version of it. It was years ago. Some little tender, verdant, half-harmles8 abuses would have withered up and flown off in chaff before that fierce sarcasm; but not so this sturdy old stump, this true specimen of an English solecism, this lahv of divorce.
There is a stubborn tenacity of life in every old English nuisance, whether physical or moral. This indissolubility of marriage by the ordinary forms of law is worthy of its class and of its soil. It grew up among us no one knows how, in times when there was no ascertained Christian creed upon the subject. It was found also in other countries. In those other lands, wsherever the Reformation came, the weed died. Here in England Archbishop Cranmer and nine other divines plucked it up by the roots and cast it aside; 289 and 302 years ago the Ecclesiastical Courts could dissolve the bond of marriage. Butt the stanch old nuisance, although uprooted, would not die. Many years afterwards Archbishop Bancroft found it with its buds still R~reen. He planted it in the congenial soil of the btar-chaniber, watered it with the tears of the laity, and quickly it shot down its tap root strong as ever. It has fourished and borue its bitter fruits even down to our day. For many years past it has had a host of enemies, and no other friends than those learned but sparse ecclesiastics who feel uncomfortable about a certaia canon of the Council of Trent, which in 1563, while our Ecclesiastical Courta were dissolving the bond of marriage, first authoritatively announced to the Rtoman Catholic world that marriage was indissoluble, and ended, in words terrible to non-Protestant ears, " S; qlis di.rerit ecdesiam errare anathema sit." All others-jurists, statesmen, philosophers, historians, Prostestant dirines-have been its enemies. Grotius, Erasmus, Calvin, and Martin Bucer give early testimony against it: in our age Brougham attacks it, Lord Campbell denounces it, Lord St. Leonard's abandons it as hopeless at this time of day, Lord Lyndhurst ex3nilnes it with the passionless serenity of a mellowred intellect andauthoritatively condemns it, aud Lord Cranworth promises to destroy it.
What need, then, of further onslaught? Why does the press bear more pamphlets?' For this good reason :-The brains have been out these 3(0 years, but the thing wiU not die. "Ictint.s er-deis is the only motto for those who would destroy a "domestic institution" such as this. In England we never destroy until we are quite agreed as to how we shall replace. If Gog and MEa,og nwere alive and happy sitting upon the steps of the Royal Exchange and dividing between them a score of civic babies at every morning meal, -we should not shoot or expel Gog and M3agog until we had thoroughly agreed as to what should be done with their larder of live babies, what dreeses they should wear, in what religion they should be educated, and upon what diet they should be brought up. Two or three Royal commissions, and three or four abortive legislative propositions emanating therefrom, would be obviously necessary to this end; and if meanwhile Gog and Magog should moderate their appetites, or consent to feed only upon foundlings, perhaps the excitement would go to sleep, until the giants relapsed into old habits and the nation was awakened again by some shrill mother's cry.
Wisely therefore did Mrs. Norton some time since publish her eloquent appeal to the Queen against the wrongs which her sex suffer, and still more wisely does she now follow up that appeal by a pamphlet which, although evidently not from her pen, is, we presume, much indebted to her active concurrence. Mrs. Norton's letter had all the excellences, in strength and weakness, of woman's nature. The reader might sometimes smile at its inconsequential reasoning; oftentimes he might be offended with its tempestuous tone; but, as he tracked the sad story of her private wrongs, he must have felt that she was mainly right. Lord Cranworth, in an unfortuate phrase, for which he afterwards apologized, had intimated that it was " a little proffigate" in a husband to commit adultery; and Lord Campbell had said that in most cases adultery in the husband might be condoned. With what fiery scorn does the indignant 'woman invest these two unfortunate lawyers I With whatquiet contempt does shedi8i3theshallowandpedantic nobleman who objected to dissolution of marriages altogether. What a crowd of memories of injured women does she invoke; how grand she is when, in little episodes of passion, she clutehes at random large handsfull of facts and phrases as they pass over her excited memory, and casts them pellmell at the tyrant man. Many have said that this vehemence is unwomanly. We think it is eminently otherwise. The earnest, passioniate, unreasoning impulses, the generous instincts of woman are all here. In another cause-if they had been exercised to help an heroic husband on his path of glory, or to sustain and cheer him in captivity or exile-those who condemn her most would have applauded her the loudest,
Strange to say, Mrs. Norton is strong only in language. She is generally reasonable in what she proposes. Although sheholds insueh scorn those ucldess lawyers who refused to allow a woman to divorce her husband for adultery, she is not extreme in her demands that the opposite doctrine should universally obtain. She says-
"A man may yield to the temptation of passion who yet at heart loves and rets his wife, and faeis, after his delusen is over, a real shame and repentance. Nor is want of chastity the only sin in the world; a woman who is a chaste
wife may fll her husband's das with unendurable bitterness, ana aman who has lapse d in his observance of the marrage vow may neverthele68 be a kindly htuband and father, with whom reconcilement would be a safe and blessed generosity.
"But in unusual case,-in cases, not of simplc inconstancy, but of the dreary, stormy, deserted life,-where pro-
fligacy, personal violence, insult, and oppression fill uP the
measureof tha rong whnichipardon canoreach, why is there to be no rescue for the woman'? Why is sutch a man to be sheltered under the Lord Chancellor's term o of 'ol a
little profligate,'and 'condonation' be sunppsdteol proper notice of his conduct'?" psdteol
If Mr.s. Norton means by this that habitual and continuing profligacy in a husband should be a ground for divoroe at the suit of the wife, we think she is right, and that the public opinion of England will go with her. If she asks for more than this she wll be heard and disregarded.
Mms. Norton's maseuline ally, although of the stronger sex, is a weaker spirit. He is so gallant a
man that (ignorant or forgetfful of poor John M iltoa and his solitary home) he a ot coneive the posibity of a. wife deserting her husband, unles under pressure of the Mormton maa. IHe putEs forth 20
propositions and a postscript on the subject of what the law should be, but he so little knows what tha law is, that he tells us that-
" A wife divorced from her husband by the Ecclesiastical Court, or deserted by, or separated from him, has no rightg or remedeies at law or in eqRity, except such in relation to her husband as have been described.
" If she be robbed she cannot prosecute.
"If she be libelled, or 6slndered, she cannot prosecute.",
This is not so. The criminal courts are as open to married women as they are to spinsters, and they afford the best and cheapest remedy for robbery and defamation. It is true, indeed, that thewife cannot bring an action in our courts without joining her husband's name, but there is no good object to be obtained by overstating a case.
We have read these 20 propositions with eare, and can assure Mrs. :Norton that she would not be vweU advised in adopting them, and that they are not calculated to assist the object of a rational reform in the present law of husband and wife. Many of them hack only at details, some of them are weakly directed at the circumstances of Mrs. Norton's own case, where, as she asserts in her pamphlet, the technical error of a non-interposition of trustees defeated the intention of an agreement; others, again, such as the 19th proposition, " that the maritaO right of a husband shall be restrieted," are vague and unmeaning; there are some which unnecessarily jntroduce topics of strife, as that which would make adultery an indictable offence, and more than one are sheer nonsense. There is much zeal and no ability. It is very well for Mirs. Norton, who avows a personal interest in the question, to take a strong line. The same license is not to be allowed to a mere volunteer.
There is ample room for a temperate and philosophical review of the whole law of husband and wife. It is quite true that it is very imperfect; but it is not true that its imperfections are all in favour of the husband. If a man marry a woman in debt he becomes liable for the whole of her debts; if after marriage she sue hinr in the ecclesiastical courts upon some foolish quarrel in which there have been bickerings on both sides, the husband wiU have to pay not only his own costs, but also the bills of the proctors and lawyers who have perhaps stirred up the strife-perhaps he may have to be grateful to the memory of those ecclesiastical judges who have created precedents to the effect that " it would be too much to declare it cruelty that the husband lay in a separate bed" (" D'Aguilar v. D'Aguilar,' 1 Hag. Eccl. R., 775), or that if a wife should say to her husband, " Ihavemarried abeggar, andraised him to a coach," it is not cruelty to retort, "I'll send you to bedlam" (" Osborne v. Osborne"), or that it is not cruelty to deny a wife a carriage ("Evans v. Evans," 1 Hag. Cons. R, 38). Let him remember, however, that " where the facts are not numerous, nor without intermixture of affection on the part of the husband, and not without some provocation on the part of the wife," cruelty will yet be found and a divorce granted ("Holder v. Holder," 1 Hat. E3ccl. R., 44i8). We find no fault with this rule; it is a wholesome and a Just rule, so long as the divorce to he so obtained amounts only to a separation; but if an absolute divorce and a capacity to remarry followed, the interests of society and of the offspring of the first marriage would reouire that this now salutary rule should be modified.
Another point on which the tyrants have not the law entirely on their side is that of " ante-nuptial incontinence."X Any one who will turn to the first volume of Addams' Reports will find there the case of " Perrin v. Perrin." In that case a man after marrying a reputed virgin became suddenly conscious of the fact that she had already provided herself with an interesting family of three children, each the offspring of a different father. Fortunately for the husband, the lady's offences did not end here; but when a suit was instituted the judge rejected all notice of the ante-nuptial incontinence, and ordered the statement to be erased from the proceedings as "extraneons matter inijurious to the defence."
What does all this prove? Not that the law should not be altered, but that we should approach the subject in a temperate and impartial spirit; that we should come to the task not with a claptrap cry about woman's rights, but with an earnest desire to remove injustice wherever injustice is occasioned by the law.
Putting the dogmatists aside there are still three parties who must be heard upon this divorce question. The first of these classes is the most important, the most numerous, and the most difficult to convince.
In England the great mass of marriages are, so to speak, happy marriages. Perhaps they do not quite realize the sweet dream ofthat vinous bachelor poet, James Thomson. There may not be an entire "sympathy of soul," and "will" may not always " prevent will " in the sense of t' e poet; yet upon the whole they are generally very content, and ofttunes very happyeven to the occasional cita. tion of those household lines-
"Oh, speak the joy! Ye whom the sudden tear
Surprises often, while you look around
"And nothing strikes the eye but sights of bliss."
Depend upon it, this numerous class, the bulk and mass of the households of England, hate the very name of divorce. They love the indisoluble doctrine of our law as fallow deer love their park-wall. Each thinks-or entertains, without the trouble of thinking, a settled conviction of the mindthat the son of Erebus and Nox only knows what ideas of freedom might have occurred to his or her gentle partner, but that the constant view of that high fence has suppressed every wild notion m its bud, and engendered a habit of contentment. These people look upon the law of divorce as country squires look upon their title deeds. The law of real property may be very expensive and very absurd, but if they change it they have a superstitious fear that somebody may come and run away with their estates. Our happy couples may be selfish in their happiness and unreasonably suspicious as to changes which are for the happinessof their lessf ortunate neicghbours-granted. But they have a right to be heard, and they have power to make themselves heard. We must satisfy them before we can succeed.
Then we have the John Milton class. The MUtonians, under that name, have, we believe, long since died out; but they survived the occasion of their birth. Long after their founder had taken back his wife, and had left off writing about the doctrine and discipline of divorce, his converts repeated his bewailings. "Where you hate, " divorce" was John Miton's doctrine at this time of his life. But John Milton was mistaken -he did not hate. The first return of fondness overcame, as Bayle maliciously remarks, not only the jealous husband, but the comniitted author. These Miltonians groan in bitterness in the bondage of an ill-assorted union-they lie " in the uttermost and bottomless gulf of chaos deeper from holy bliss than the world's diameter multiplied." There they must lie, for no English statesman has yet ventured to attempt to help them out. Society would be unhinged, and the next generation would be strangely educated if mere incompatibility of temper were a ground for divorce. In Paris during one year while such a license existed the divorces were nearly one-half as numerous as the marriages.
The third class are also
"Linked and wedlock-bound "To a fel adversary
but they are those -who, without faalt themselves, are united to partners with whom it would be infamous or unsafe to live. These persons ask little more than the Government bill of last session offered. They ask that all divorce cases shall be tried before an ordinary tribunal; that a man shall obtain a divorce for adultery in his wife, and a woman for habitual adultery in her husband; that this court may award, for cruelty or desertion (shall we add for concealed ante-nuptial incontinence in the woman ),
a separation which shall restore both parties to their former civil rights, making such apportionment of property as the circumstances of the case may justify.
Surely these are rational demands. If granted, they wilI leave much to be asked before the law shall be made to exactly suit the case of a bad husband or a bad wife. But in these cases how little can we effect by legislation I How much m ust we leave untouched! How shall we prevent a man from gambling or drinking the money which should
maintRin his family? How she follov w th e Saturday night's earnings and see them safe into the prudent housewife's pocket? The relation of man and wife is an instance wherein one of Dr. Johnson's trite moralities is, although generally fal]e, pai;ticularly true,-
"Of al the ills which human hearts endure
Howf small the part which laws can cause or curp."

andL alimony; it will not be difficult to extend and regulate this jurisdiction.
It is now quite time that some moderate measure of reform were carried. Mrs. Norton shrewdly remarks that no lawyer ever yet introduced a good bill into the House of Commons but all his brotber lawyers set to work industriously to pick holes in it. If this practice do not disappear the constituencies will themselves abate it. AIready there is a cry against returning lawyers to Parliament. As yet it is ridiculous, for it is only brought to bear against men who wear the gown as a mere badge of a nominal profession. Of such are half the men of letters and country gentlemen in England. But if a few expectant Attorneys and Solicitors General and Lord Chancellors were told that law reforms are not considered a legitimate subject for party battles and delicate manceuvres in the game of patronage-and if they were told this at the poll booths-there would be hope for this and for other as important biUs in the coming session.

"A Legal Accident."
" A LEGAL ACCIDENT."
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES
Sir,-In reply to the letter of " Vera&e in The 1inma of to-day, I beg to observe that when I first addressed you on the subject of the "legal accident" which befel my late friend Mr. Temple, and plunged his family from happiness into the most deplorable reverse of fortune, I did not do so with a view to obtain subscriptions for his widow. The object I wished to accomplish was to aid the future administration of justice, by showinghow signally it had failed in my friend's case-an object of much greater importance than the distress of any particular individual, no matter how severe or undeserved. I did not then know that one of his children had, through the charitable interposition of the Messra. Coter and Co., of Aldermanbury, been provided for in the Warehousemen's and Clerkl' Schools; and had I known it, I should havo most certainly mentioned the eircumstance If lrs. Temple had had no children at all she would have had a faU title to the commiseration of all right-minded persons. It did not appear to me necessary to stateo Mr Temple's religion, as your corre spondent " Vera' has generously taken the pains to do, accompanying his explanation by an appeal to prejudices wholly out of place in a question that ought to stand sololy on that broad basis of charity which should be common to every form of Christian profession. But the letter of " Verax" is not only unamiable in spirit,-it is at variance with his signature. It is not true that the younger child was withdrawn at the desire of Cardinal Wiseman. His Eminence never interfered, and, in fact, knew nothing whatever of MLr. or M1r Temple till he was urgently appealed to by persons acquainted with MrI Temple's distressed condition.
I must also observe that " Verax" would have deserved his name better had he been candid enough to commence his communication thus :-" As a large amount of subscrip. tions will be coilected for the widow of the late Mr. T-, I am anxious to see if I carnot stop the flow of public benevolence by inserting into it the spirit of controversy." He should also, as he professes to know the wishes of the husband's 1 " relationt" with regard to the religious education of the children, have given some account of what the relatives have done for their brother's widow. He ought to have added that, whatever their views might be with regard to the religious teaching of the children, they were not shared by their late brother, who permitted his children to be baptized and educated ir the faith of the Catholic Church.
" Verax" is anxious for the truth; I can satisfy him by letters written in prison by the late Mr. Temple that the conduct pursued towards him by his relatives irm the hour of distress and calamity was not of that nature to justify their claim to the remotest authority over the education of the orphans I w1il show " Verax" these letters, and I will then leave it to him to say whether it was charitable to pretend to a religious difference between a husband and wife where none existed, for no other purpose than to in. dulge an unhappy leaning towards the odium t7woWicun.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TTMES.
Sir,-ly attention has been attracted to a letter which appered in your columns to-day, in which lMr. J. Brady has thought fit to connet, in a manner wvhich requires some explanation, my name with what he calls a 'legal acci-
Your impression of the 19th inst. contained an account from the pen of Mr. Brady of the arrest, trial, and conviction of a friend of his not named, for stealing a carpetbag in the early rb of 1853,1at some railway station not named, ano where trial took place at a place not named, before a judge not named. This account failed to brin to my recollection that I had been engaged as counsel in the case; and, even had I recognized it, I should have been whooUy unable to believe that my assistance was expectedor required in a matter with every detail of which it was his obvious desire to impress upon the public that he was in full possession so far as his "frienda could afford them, and to show that be had attempted, but in vain, to exhaust every other means of inqry, but that he had been tLwarted in his endeavours to btaizn that full information which would establish the innocence of his " friend."
Upon this appeared in your impression of yesterday a letter sgned "A Barrister," who somewhat naively SUQgests to Mr. Brady to scertain the names of the counsel who had been engaged in the case, and to apply to them for information; and the " Barrister " does but common justice to the profession in assuring him that he would be certain to meet with most ready asistance.
3Mr. Brady replies in another letter in 27c Times to-da
pubhingthe names of the learned judge,who tried the case, of myselfn as counsel for the railway company which instituted the prosecution, and of my friend Mr. O'Brien, who conducted the defence. It may well be that neither the learned judge nor the counsel for the prisoner could afford anyF assistance in tho investiption which has occupied MxI. Brady for nearly four years, but it is apparent that much might reasona be expected from those who conducted the prosecution, and that the publication of my name 'Was intended to give weight to his assertion of his friend's innocence, as that of a person who had either in. vestizated, believed it, and could prove it, or of one who belied the" Barrister's" estimate of the duty of a member of the bar- and ought to be therefore held up to public repro-
Sir, if no interests had been at stake but my own, I should have been content to bave passed over- Mr. Brady's letter in silence, But whether a respectable person has not been improperly coxvicted of a disgraceful crime, ad whether, after conviction, proof of his innocence has not been withheld by those concerned in the administration of ustice, are questions with which the public have to do It is but right, therefore, that it should be known that from the moment of Mr. T-'s conviction to the present time I have neverreceived the slightest communication on the subject from Mr. Brady, who has been carsing on an inquiry for years nor from anyone else. I never heard of any inquiry, and even since the discussion which Mt. Brady has originated in your columns he has never addressed himself to me; and it was not until after reading his last letter to-day that I had any recollection of having been engaged in the case. I have now, byreference to my boooks, ascertained the simple fact of my having boen. as he alleges, counsel for the prosecution in the case of " The Queen, on the prosecution of the London and North-Western Railway Company, v. Temple." Having done so, I wiUl not be deterred by lr. Brady's want of courtesy, or want of judgment, whichever it may be, in not commuicating vith me before bringimy namo before the publi, from aquaint. ing hinsthat if he wi write to me to signify bswant of the inormation I shall be happy to furnsh him with the name and address of the solicitor by whom I was instructed. That gentleman will require no request from me to induce him to supply him with my brief, containing a copy of the dep0astions tak-en upon the prisoner's examination. my notes of the trial, and ever other information which it is possible to obtain; and i Mr. Brady can succced in rescuing his friend's memory from the stain that has been cast upon it. and in rendeing tardy justice to his unhappy widow and children, no one will be more rejoiced than I shall be.
It is certainly true that occasionally " leal accidents" occur. The admson amounts to no more than this, that aU human institutions are imperfect, and that judges, jries, and counsel are but men. But my experience has led me to believe that there is none in the world so adapted to the investigation of tnrth and to the administration of crminal justice as trial by jury, and the more especially when conducted under the direction of the judges of the superior courts. The case of Mr. T- may possibly be one of those errors from which no human wisdom is free. If it be so, it is the more to be lamented that it never should have occurred to the mind of the unfortunate victim's friend to apply to the magistrate who conducted the preliminary inqulry, or to the professional gentlemen engaged in the t or infor mation, or to the Secretary of State for an official investi.
on. It is now too late to remedy the injustice, if any
done to the accused. But the public is informed that he has left an innocent and nearly destitute widow and children, and I should be sorry that their cause should be intrusted merely to Mr. Brady. I shall therefore at once put myself into communication with the attorney by whom wa s instructed, and with others who have the means and the willingness to sift the matter to the utmost, and who will, Iasm cert.ain, do ererything in their powv to do jus. tico to all pe.rties concerned,
I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your very obedient uervant.

Sir,-Scarcely a day passes that wr, do not find in one or other of the morna- journab a letter under the above or some similar heasng. acknowledging in most instnces the contributions of a benevolent pablic towards the maintenance of persons who have become the unfortunate victims of legal ccidents. While it is lamentable to think that such ccidents must nd will hppen from time to time in our law courts,where criminal jurisprudence is administered with the uitmost impartir.l1ty, and where the scale of justice alvays preponderates on thie side of mercy, it does occur to us that the British public, who pay so ungrudginIy for the support and reformation of their criminal populaion,
weu;ld nvpt be iniisp9§d to make prvi4on £mr ^^ nnoz.rI
tuinato (and happily) few of those vwho aro illegally convicted.
Many years ago, when the late Sir Robert Peel was Secretary of State for the Home Department, it happened that three men were placed in the dock of the Old Bailey on trial for burglary, with violence, in the ontsLirts of London. The witnesses for the prosecution-and there were many of thenm-swore positively to the identity of the prisoners, who -were foanl guilty, and on belng as ked respectively wlhat they had to say in their defence sfore sentene was passed31 they all thre stated that "1tbey were at Astleys", at the time of the alleged burdlory. Sentence of death was passed ons thetaninLthe umsu,orte and they were left for execution. In those days the time allowed to criminals between serntence and execution was much less than it is now, and in this case it had nearly expired when the Home Secretary ordered a respite in consequence of a statement forwarted to him from the Ordinary of Newpbte, who showed ground for believing that one of the prisoners was innocent. The judge's notes wer referred to, the evidenco re-examined, and, no sufricient cause appearing. in siti'ation of sentence, another day was fixed or carrying out th lawn. The zealous Ordinary was unremitting in his attention to the condemned, and was stilr so fully convinced, in his own minro of the innocence of one of them that he ventuared to forward an expre he to Sir Ro;bert Peel, -who had retired for relaxation to the Isle of Wight, eraying for a further resrite bThat high-minde eian, whose fine sense of jcstet, awas p rinent among his mnany noble qualities, came at once to London, the condemned felon was again examined, and stil gav the same answer as when he was in the dock, "I was at Astleybs" After much difficulty, for he was a very ignorant mnan, the facat was extracted from him that his wife and children retumred from the play in a. hackney coach while he had sat on the box, and e further recolected that his conversation with the coachman was about a battle that had been fought that nmorning between two great pe 4hterav if my memory is correct, between crb a n Molneu After veryg grat difficulties the drivertofythe cac, who was unknown to

The Price Of Gold.
THE PRICE OF GOLD.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-In the letter which you. inserted on the 13th of January I mentioned that, as you had already published three replies to the queries of " Dunce" I should confine myself to a few general observations; but as " Dance" in his second letter of the 21st of January still appears anxions for further information, I beg to offer the following portion of the explanations I had previously prepared on the subject of the premium of gold in Paris.
If the actual quantities of pure gold in the English sovereign and the French napoleon are compared with each other there will resalt the "intrinsic or Mint par" between the two countrles. Authorities may slightly differ as to the exact comparative value, but 25f. 22c. per pound sterling appears to be the ususay received par of exchange. A difference of a centime more or less is, however, of little importance, since this mintage par has no connexion whatever with the purchase and sale of bullion in Prais, the practice of which is based on entirely distinct principles
The standard for both gold and silver in France is 900 milliemes fine-that is 9-lOths of pure gold in the total weight; and one kilogramme of gold of this fineness is coined into 155 napoleons of the nominal value of 20f. each-that is, into 3,1Of. The " retenue," or the amount kept back for the expenses of coinage, is fixed by law at 6f. per Idlogramme, so that the Mint would return to the owner of bullion 3,094f. for every kilogramme of gold 9-lOths fine which he had delivered to them.
It is the castom in France that gold bullion should be bought and sold according to the above amonnt of coin returned by the Mint-that is, the T tariff rate" for gold 9-l0thsfineis3,094f.perldogramme, and from this price the tariff rates of all other qualities of gold are calculated according to their degree of fineness; pure gold being put down at l,434f. 34c.; and English standard gold, which is estimated to correspond in their scale to 916 or 917 thou. sanths fine, is generally calnulated at about 3,151f. 30c, per kilogramme. These tariff rates are called the par values of gold bullion according to its fineness; and the premium or discount per miie is added or subtracted from this par value of the bulion.
The basis of the French currency being silver, the coined gold was allowed to circulate for whatever price it could command, and the premium on 20f.-pieces was for rmny years very considerable, 17 and 20 per miUle not being uncommon. Owing to the greater proportionate valne of silver which has recently prevailed this high premium has gradually diminished, and the premium on coined gold is now very smal. The result of this mode of dealing in gold bullion is that a seller at par obtains precisely the amount of silver francs which he would have received had he sent his gold to be coined, and the premium on the bullion, if he obtains it, would equally have been received on the 20f.-pieces after he had got them back from the Mint and changed them for silver coin.
By the usual chain rule (of which your readers have probably by this time bad quantum suff.) the actual " bullion par" of 2Sf. 17c. per pound sterling can easily be ob. tned, to which the current premium per mile is to be added. It is quite useless to insist, as it has been sometimes attempted, that as the Mint par is 2Sf. 22c. this is the rate at which gold should be estimated, as it is impossible to sell gold in Paris except according to the established usages of the place, and the premium generally more than compensates for the difference between the two pars. A nominal par, founded on custom, and corrected by a premium, is not confined to dealings in bullion at Paris; a similar assumed basis exists in the exchange with the United States. At some remote period of commercial antiquity the silver dollar was worth 4s. 6d. English sterling, and from that time downwards to our days this has been caUed the exchange " par " between England and America The American dollar being however worth considerably less than the above amount (the extreme variations may be put down at 4s. and 4s. 2d.) the method has been adopted of quoting the exchange at so much per cent. premium on the sterling, the present rate being about 8 per cent,, and giving nearly 4s. ldL as the value of the dollar. In this case the premium on the sterling equalizes the over-estimate in the value of the dollar at par, and, in the instance of the French bullion calculations, the premium compensates for the tariff rate being below the intrinsic value of the gold; and both are subject to the variations incidental to a flnctuating supply and demand of biUs and bullion.
I will conclude with a few words in reference to the letter of " W. H. B.," in your paper of the 19th inst, who appears to be wrong in his second objection, viz., that the difference found between the product of the gold and the price of a short bill on London should be divided by 25f. 17c., the bulion par, in order to obtain the per oentage profit or lees. Surely, when gold yields in Paris 25f. 90c. for every pound sterling disbursed in London, and this gives a loss of 60c.,as compared with 26f. 50c., the price of Ea short bil on London, the per centage loss must depend on one of these terms (the representative of the amount laid out), and not on an arbitrary and invariable amount of 25f. 17c., which he would appear to wish to be used on all occasions. He has omitted also to observe that the writer of the work from which "R. (G." haa taken his extract is peculiarly unfortunate in having selected for his illustration an exceptional case in March, 1848, during the last French revolution, wvhen all exchanges and money matters were in utter confusion, as a diffierence of 2 per cent. inthe price of gold between London and Paris, although true at the time quoted, is not a fair example of the usual variations of the two markets.

TSE IRIS AGBRCULTUIAL lN'TREST.
The following stateament of the condition antI propects of the agricultural interest, with a reference, supported by figures, to Irish progress generaUly, is condensed from the Farmers' Gazette, a cautious and competent authority upon suc' matters:-
",Daring the past two or three years the I azricultsral interest' has enjoyed a state of prosperity which i any oneu had possessed enough of foreknowledge or hardihood to gredict but a short time before, his views would have been scouted as utterly preposterous, and in the highest degree improbable. It is, however, an undeniable fact that the agriculturists of the united kingdom have oE late years been placed-it may have been by a combination of unforeseen cLrcsumsances-in a position which even the most sanguine could scarcely have imagined, that every pretence for the exercise of the hereditary privilege of grumbling has been taken away, and that the tune to which tarmers have of late been most accustomed has been thati known as 'Money in both pockets.' Nor has this state of things been confined to any one portinn of the agricultural world. The grain farmer, the grazier, and the dairy. man have all shared alike, and no class has had reason to be jealous of or to envy the other. If we turn t3e the market reports which reach us weekly from all parts of the kingdom, we find that everywhere, instead of being pressed to meetj current engagements, and therefore forced to sell, 'whatever the price may be, farmers are now able, if the terms offered do not suit their views, to tie up their sacks or sample bags, and take them home again until such time as their demxnds are complied with. It is scarcely neoessay to say that the prosperity of the agricuAturat classes s, to us, a subject of much gratifica. tion. Specially devoted as our laboura are to the advanoement of those interests, a feeling of satisfaction naturally arises in our minds when we look back on the events of tbe past few years. Gloomy despoondency has given gm to a more buoyant state of feeling, and those who cbn2 only read ruin in the futusre have had reason to know how narrow and shortsighted all our views must be when we attempt to unveil what is wisely hidden from our sight, or to limit; to the standard of our puny notions the doings of Him whoe is, indeed, 'wonderful in working.' Although we meet OIL every hand with substantial and convincing proofs of the rapid strides which this countryismakingin social progreer, it will be interesting to direct our attention to certain corroborative testimony which tends still further to strengthen our position. The follow;ing statemnents, taken from the, condensed reports in Thom's Almanasc, showr us the numsber of paupers relieved in Ireland in each year during thc, last ten years, and the annual expenditure:

If the auxiliary workhouses were abolished, not being now required, the annul expenditure would be stil furtherreduced, as inthe 'annual expenditure,' specified in the foregoing table, all salaries ataa other expenses are included, besides the maintenance of the pauper We observe that in several parts of the country there is a strong feeling expre8sed for the abolition of the ausxiliary workhouse and their respective staffs of officials. Thisis urgently required, and we hope that the agitation oE the question will be everywhere successful.
" But there is another equally important change in our social condition to which we must allude-namely, the diminution of crime. The following statement shows the pro. portion of convictions to population which tok place irona 846 to 1855 inclusive-the convictions comprehending not only those at assizes *naquarter sessions, but alosummary convictions before magistrates for petty offences and' drunkenness, together with the number of capital sentenursa and executions in each year:-

COMMUICATION WITH NEVFOUNDLA2D.
The Cork Reporter announces that Mr. John Shea, J.P., has been appointed agent in Ireland on behalf of the Government of Newfoundland to negotiate with some of the principal shipowners a system of direct steam communication monthly between Great; Britain and that colony. In the course of sumeremarks upon the subject the Repodter says .-
" This would insure for them the carriage of the mails, instead of having them sent to Halifax, as they at present; an? a route b which a journey of 1,000 miles is unnecessarily wastd in the despatch of letters, &c., to Newfoundland. The colonial Government will, we are informed, for the purpose of encouraging such shipowners as may embark In the undertaking, make a very liberal allowance to them yearly, so as to render the project as feasible and productive as possible. Now, it occurs to usthat, as the authorized agent for transacting this negotiation is on the spot, and as we have plenty of ment of capital and shipowners among us to carry the matter into execution, without abandoning it to the hands of other speculators, if our local men of business would act with a, httle spirit we might establish the required line of vessels ourselves, and by keeping a control over their management make Cork also a port of ealL Thuw e should be obtaining a double advantage, and at the same time show that we are not so deficient in enterprise as to allow every means of advancement and profitto pass by us, to enrich others more capable of maidng a well-considered venture."

The Affair At Canton.
THE AFFAIR AT CANTON.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIES.
Sir,-Since writing the letter on the subject of the Arrovr case which you did me the favour to insert in your journVa of the 21st inst., I have obtained a copy of the Hongkon [ordinance regulating the registration of vessels, under which
the Arrow obtained her register, and find that it affords further and still more conclusive evidence than that ahLeady advanced by me in justification of the course pursued by ouf authorities in demanding reparation for the insult offered by Yeh and his satellites.
It appears from clause 4 of the ordinance that the English name of the vessel must have been conspicuously painted omk her stern, in letters at least 4 inches long, in both Romana and Chinese characters. Hence there is no ground for the statement that the Chinese authorities did not know she was a foreign vesseL
Clause 7 provides that the master shall be British, or, at any rate, conversant with our language. This condition wa, strictly complied with, the master of the Arrow being Mr. Kennedy, of Belfast.
By clause 10 the annual license is renewable on its expiration by simple endorsement, accompanied by the payment; of afee of 10 dollars. To obtain this eudorsement thet register must be deposited in the office at Hongk-ong for oneweek before the expiration of the year; or, if the vessel be at sea at the time, then on her return. Supposing it to turm out hereafter, as I before contended to be probable, that the Arrow had not been at Hongkong since her license expired. it is perfectly clear that the lapse of the few days about which so much has boen said and written did not work v forfeiture of the British rights of the vessel ; but that at the moment of the outrage she remained a British ship im every sense of the word. By Yeh's own argument she had borne her Brtish character from the very date of her launching,
Lastly, byclauselL anyinfringementof theprovisionsof the, ordinance " renders the register ipso facto void, and render3 the ship sailing under such register forfeit to the Crown." If,, therefore, tho Arrow had disobeyed those provisions, which the clearlyhad if she had made an improper use of the British flag (as is contended by those who find fault with our pro. ceedings), it may be true enough that she had voided her British register; but it seems to me that at the same time ahe had clearly become forfeit to, and the property of, Her Majesty; consequently, the offence of the Chinese officiaL& appers gaver than ever, the insult being directed, not merely against a British ship, but against a ship belonging to Her Majesty.

At Vienna the market has remained for some time without variation, but it is likely to be strengthened by a statement just put forth, that the general amnesty granted in the Italian provinces will be followed by a reduction of 70,000 men in the Austrian army.
The Paris advices state that various influential parties are competing for new banking privileges. One poposition, wvhich is said to be well supported
side, and to be generally regarded with favour, is for the formation of a large international bank for the introduction of the English system.
A further sum of 100,0001. in gold was taken from the Bank to-day for exportation to the continent in payment for silver.
The specie by the Niagara from New York is 51,600l., probably all on French account.
The Indian exchanges to-day reported by telegraph present no alteration beyond a slight increase of firnness, which will tend further to encourage shipments of silver from this side. The quotations ,ere 2s. 21d. to id. at Bombay, and 2s. 2gd. to 7-16d. at Calcutta. From China the additional particulars received, 'iqa Trieste, and dated Hongkong, December 16, show the exports of tea to date to have been 3S5,000,0001b., against 48,500,0001b. at the corresponding period of the previous year. ,Of silk there were 48,000 bales, against 22,600 in 1855. The settlements of silk were 60,000 bales, and prices were $20 higher. Trade at Shanghai and Foochow was going on without interruption.
The full confirmation of the recent news from China imparted additional firmness to the teaimarket this morning, and several thousand chests 'were disposed of at is. lid. and Is. 1id., at which latter quotation there were ultimately sellers. A good inquiry prevailed for other descriptions, and higher prices were offered, but holders were indisposed to realize.
The trade reports for the past week show a further increase of activity, except at Manchester, where business opened heavily, a decline in prices being arrested only by the firmness of the Liverpool cotton-market. At Birmingham there is an advancing tendency in iron, owing to the American and also the continental demand. l the general trades of the place there has been no particular alteration, but in some cases employment is checked by the uninterrupted advance in the prices of raw material. The Chamber of Commerce have resolved to aid the movement for procuring a reform of the bankruptcy laws. The Kidderminster Bank, wvhich stopped on the 13th ult., shows debts amounting to 45,8721. against assets estimated at 34,7001., and a dividend of 12s. 6d. is expected. At Nlottingham there has been general activity, and, notwithstanding the advance in prices, the stocks of hosiery are lower than ever. In the woollen districts there is full employment, and the Irish linen-markets are without change.
The Hamburg letters mention that the rate of discount has receded to 5i per cent., and that the exchange has a favourable appearance.
At a special meeting of the Bank of London, held to-day, Sir J. V. Snelley, M.P., in the chair, a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum, free of income-tax, was declared, and the report and accounts were unanimously adopted. It was stated that business has made steady progress, and that a fair amount of profit has been realized, although the directors have considered it necessary to exercise caution in extending their transactions. The pressure in October and November, when the Bank of England adopted measures of increased restriction, occasioned a loss of 6,5001. through the sale of securities; but in other respects there has been no drawback. Some searching questions were put with regard to advances to directors, the preparation of the accounts, and the lending of money on or trafficking in the shares of the bank; all of wvhich were answered to the satisfaction of the meeting. It was also announced that immediately upon the failure of the Royal British Bank the auditors of the Bank of London waited upon the directors, and informed themselves of the mode of management, and that they have again instituted a full in-quiry, testing in every shape the accuracy of the accounts and the validity of the securities. A statement was presented of liabilities and assets, but somue of the shareholders complained of the absence of a profit and loss account. It was explained, however, that the present wras only a special meeting, with the view of affording the proprietors the opportunity of communicating with the directors, and that the profit and loss account will be furnished on the 30th of June next, the end of the first year. Meanwhile it was mentioned the profits exhibit an ample balance to pay the dividend and to provide for other charges. In answer to further questions it w^as stated that no bills have been rediscounted, and that the capital is wholly employed in convertible securities, the extreme period in any case being nine months. A suggestion to forward to the ptoprietors a copy of the monthly statement published in the Lowndo
(Garettc is to receive the consideration of the Board, -who volunteer to give every available information. Before the close a protracted discussion ensued respecting the alleged connexion of the Bank of London with the Bank of London and National Provincial Assurance Company, some of the shareholders stating it to be injurious to the bank, while others took a different view. In answer, the chairman repeated that the sole connexion between the two establishments is the relation of landlord and tenant, the assurance company renting a portion of the bank premises and having introduced good business. Nevertheless, as objection has been taken to the similarity of names, the directors of the Assurance Company in applying to Parliament for an act during the present session for some other purpose contemplate the introduction of a clause empowering them to alter their title. The auditors having personally borne testimony to the SyiStemlof management, votes of
thanks were passed to the directors and officers Annexed is an abstract of the report:-
" The deed of settlement contemplates one ordinary general meeting annully, which the proprietors have already determined shall be held after the lose of the finau. ¢isl period, ending on the 30th of June* but the directors onsdering recent cirumstanes, have thought it desirable to call the proprietors together on the present occasion of the declaration of a divdend, believing that opportunities for intercourse betwveen directors and shareholders should be encouraged, as conducivo to mutual confidence. The accunt of liabilities and assets, as vouched by the audito
shows a balance standing to credit of 'profit and loss' on the
31st of December last of 16,9041., after ayment of th sum of 20,28. to customers for interest on teir balanes, The directors, havlng ly considered the prov onto be made for bad and douhtf*I debts and other contingenes, have decided to declare a dividend for the haf-year at the rate of
615. per cent. per annum (free of Incometax), reserving a complete settlement of profit and ioes =mi after the th ,of June next, aa origmlly determined. I will be seen that
the profits for the past half-year have not been proportionate to the busineu acquired, and it should be stated in ex-
plAnation that dnring that period the directcrs, an admi. misterisg the affairs o a banl so recetly edablihed, hae i'elt it their dtto mae sacriice to security at the expese of temuporary profit, by keeping in hand ample avail-
able funds, and by the reallzatlon of secrities at a deprecla-
hion, acting under the onviction that durlntv a penod of anosietry peur-e and gteneral mistrust tbaey by such a &ourse best onsulted the mteresh of gu , proprieor, and
laid the sure3t basis for future prosperity. Not;withstandin, the operation of exceptional circumstances upon immediate profir, the bank has since the date of the last report ad. vanced steadily, and without intermission, in the acquisition of business. Current accounts, in particular, which are the chief source of profit, have increased 3.3 per cent. in niumber and 29 per cent. in amount of balances; ind the directors are fully justified in asserting that the progress of the undertaking has been suh7tantial, and that its prospects are satisfactory. The building expenses bave been slighitly augmented by the purchase of the leawe and adaptation of the premises adjoining the Charing-cross branch,-a step rendered necessary by the rapidly increasing business of that establishment. On the other hand, the directors have the satisfaction to report that they have made arrangements with respect to that portion of the premises in the city not required for business purposes upon advantageous terms. The bank was admitted to the facilities of the Clearing-house on the 1st of October last.

It is stated that the proposed Mons Collieries Company will not be proceeded with in the form originally announced, and that the deposits wil be returned. The capital fixed appeared from the first to be unnecessarily large, and a new organization is contemplated, likely to prove more consistent with the present state of the various European moneymarkets.
The fact that Mr. Paul, the clerk charged by the City of London Union with frauds to the extent of more than 17,0001., had been twice bankrupt at the time vhen he was selected by the guardians for the post in which he was allowed the uncontrolled diabursement of the Union funds should receive particular notice. His first difficulties are stated to have occurred in 1827, when he was a miller in the Isle of Wight. Whether his creditors ever recovered anything on that occasion seems not to have been ascertained; but 10 years later, when he again failed, as a flour factor, in Mincing-lane, his estate, it is said, did not pay a single farthing. Would any of the guardians who thought this man the most eligible to be selected for a position of public confidence have placed him to manage, under similar circumstances, their own private funds ? If the answer be in the negative, they must plead guilty to a breach of trust which is not the less culpable from its being one of which the law takes no cognizance. It would be a hard doctrine that a person who has become insolvent or bankrupt is to be excluded for the future froni public employment, but it is essential in all such cases that they should be required to prove their course to have been unimpeachable. In the instance of Paul, like that of many others, the second stoppage seems to have been arrived at merely when he could no longer live upon his creditors' money. There can therefore be little palliation for the conduct of those who placed and sustained him in his appointment without supervision. The matter calls for public reprobation, because there is a common tendency thus to provide for persons who have made friends and acquired a position by squandering the means of others. A not inconsiderable proportion of those who are most active in getting up public companies, and who are encouraged by their friends and connexions in the task, are persons who have wholly failed to manage their own affairs.
The departures from the port of London for the Australian colonies during the past week have comprised five vessels-two to Port Phillip, one to Adelaide, one to Swan River, and one to Launceston-with an aggregate capacity of 2,565 tons. The rates of freight exhibit scarcely any alteration.
In the general business of the port of London duringthe past week there hasbeenlittle'ehange. The number of ships reported inward was 154, being 17 less than in the previous week. These included io vwith cargoes of sugar, 30 with cargoes of corn, flour, rice, dc,, and 4 with cargoes of tea, amounting in all to 33,105 packages, 35,511 chests of which were brought by the American ship King Fisher. The number of vessels cleared outward was 85, including 10 in ballast, showing a decrease of 1 -

With reaara to the general state of the trade Messrs Colcbesters and Woolner remark-" The tallow-market was flat in the early part of the week, and considerable sales were made at GIs. for delivery in the next two months, but towards the close it became firmer, and on Saturday 62s. was paid on the spot and for February and March; for Later delivery but little has been done, these periods being more neglected. The accounts from St. Petersburg quote higher prices, 158 roubles having been paid for delivery in August with hand money. To-day the market is firm, 62s. being offered for immediate delivery, o6s. for April to June.

CiN-T,aMos.--The quarterly series of public sales, bringing forward 3,250 bales, 133 boxes, and 43 parcels Ceylon cinnamon, took place this afternoon. The result is not satisfactory, not more than one-half of the above quantity being sold, and that consisting chiefly of second and lower sosts, at a decline of ld. to 2d. per lb., while for the first qualities the competition was very limited, and the bids were generally 3d. to 4d. per lb. under the previous sales' currency. There were 1,116 bales of first, ranging from is. 6d. to 2s. per lb. for the portion sold; 1,276 bales of seconds, from ls. 3d. to is. 7d.; 611 bales thirds, from Is. to Is. 4d. ; 205 bales fourths, from 9d. to lid, per lb. ; and 43 bales unassorted.

The railway-market presented a rather dull appearance, and sales later in the day caused a decline of from 5o. to 10s. per share. There was little alteration in foreign or Indian shares, and prices on the average were fairly supported. Joint stock bank and miscella-neous securities showed steadiness, the operations having been limited. A new feature in the official list is the quotation of the several slhes in the principal British mines, and business will now be regularly transacted in these securities on the Stock Exchange.

The arrivals last week were liboeral excepting oats. The exports were-1,500 quarters of whest, 1,73r quarters of barley, 61 quarters of oats, and 1,813 sacks of flour. The foreign supply of wheat was 14,951 quarters; the English, 7,046 quarters. The quantity from Rent and Rssex w-s .moderate, and condition generally bad, but even the best samnples could not be quitted at 3s. to 4s. less money, inferior being wholly neglected. To sell foreign nearly a similar reduction was necessary.
The receipts of English flour were 17,457 sacks, tho foreign being 400 sacks 28,142 barrels. Trade was exces. sively dull, liorfolks being offered at 2s. less per sack, and American was fully 2s. eheaper per barrel.
Of barley there were 2,852 quarters English, and 14,07,9 quarters foreign. The best malting was 2s. lower, and other sorts neglected at this reduction,
Oats were short-viz., only 13,514 quarters in all, of which 5,404 were Irish, 2,765 English, and remainder foreign. Business wvas slack in all qualities, and prices 6d. reduced.
Of beans there were 5,287 quarters foreign and 1,36S quarters English; of peas 935 quarters foreign and 548 quarters home grown. Both these pulse were fully Is. lower for new descriptions.
With 3,845 quarters linseed arrived, and 300 quarters exported, the price was Is. higher. Cakes also advanced lOs. per ton.

The weather has been open and showels. The wbeat trado has again ruled dull, and prices bave undergone a further reduction without leading to more thani a retail demand.
At to-day's market tlere was a liberal supply of wheat, the best samples of vwhich receded It. per quarter below the rates of last week; other sort wvere scarcely Faleable, although a considerablo reduction would have been submitted to. South country and foreign sorts wer, equally difficult to quit at the fuU abatement quoted. Ship flolur in good supply, and Is. per sack lower. Barley heavy, witb a tendeucy to decline in value. Otber kinds of grain imehanged.

The wheat trade in this locality has again been very inactive. At to-day'8 market there was a fair supply of wheat, which was taken off pretty freely ata reduction of about 6d. per windle.

At this market there was a large delivery of grain, but the trade was languid, and sales could only be made at a further reduction of about 2s per quarter. Barley, oats, and beans as before. Prices to-day -
Wheat, 16s. 6W. to22s. per load of three Imperial bushels; oats, lfs, to 40s. per quarter.
The cattle trade here to-day was dull, owing to the proximity of tho annual fair. Beasts were a shads lower in price; good mDch cows were bought up at high rates, Pigs also brisk, and higher in value.
GRANTHA3U, JAN. 24.
We still have to report very mfavourable weatber for the condition of grain, which, added to little demand, causes the price of wheat to recede considerably.

The report of tho directors. of this company seatez that the total receipts cn the raUwvay for the year 1836 amouated to 235,01t.. and for 1855 to 205,S512t., showing an increas) of 29,179t., includinv 6.13U. for passengers, 22,5821. tr goods, minerals, and live sto-k, and 4GW51. for rents. The total receipt on the comnpany's canal for the year 1556 aniounted to 14;)85iW, and for I18F to 118,8011., shoi%iigg an increase of 27,079., including 19,776G. tonnage dues. 6.3971. for carrying trade, 6051. for limestone sales, and 300?. for sndries, The director. ;stte that the increase is mainly to be attributed to the locak trade, the throu1h traffic for pas%sengers and goods being still ss etemnatically withhold and impeded, antd that thte steady progress of revenue from the independent resouLrees of the comn pany.mora than bears out the caiculations upon which tbe deiion of Mr. Steplhenson was founded in settling the traffic arrangement between the London and North-Western and the North Staffordshire companies. The arreare due on this arrangement are stilt in litigation; the difficulties and delay in the prosecution of the claims of the company have beer
equal to the anticipations of the directors when they entered on the contest, but these have been met, etch as it arose, with patience and determination, Lud there is every hopo that the special case granted on the trial wiU be settled, either with or without asking for the interference of the Lord Chief Justice, within the next few weeks, so that it may be fairly heard and decided before the next half-yearly meeting. In the meantime the directors have not thought it proper to divide any bnt the net receipts actnaUy realized, which amount to the sum of 52,1761., which enables them to recommend a dividend at the rate of 3i per cent. per annum, leaving a balance to be carried forward of 2,7141. The bill for the lease of the Bddge water Navigation has been deposited in Parliament, and a most searching examination by the directors of the details of this arrangement has in every way tended to confirm their view, that, irrespective of the positive advantage secured by the possession of the property at a rental calculated on the average net profits of three years, with a deduction ol 18 per cent. in their favour, the economy which can be effected in the combined working of the two systems, and the increased facilities afforded to the public, it will be remunerative to the shareholders, while it cannot faU to be advantageous to the locality. The directors hope that in the ensuing spring they wi be enabled to commence the works of the Biddulph branch, for the construction of which the borrowing powers of the company are alone to be made available. The directors have entered into an agreement to work the Cannock line at 50 per cent. of the gross receipts, and to transmit traffic by that route equal to 4j per cent. upon a capital not exceeding 116 O,OL., but which mav be increased according to present estimates to 280,0001., should they succeed in the application to Parliament for the extension to Wolverhampton, which they have made in accordance with the arrangement with this company. The canital account shows that 1,170,0001L was authorized to be raised for the canal and 4,650,0007, forthe raUway, making the total 5,820,0001. The loan account shows that 1,191,126f. was the amount of the borrowed money on the 31st of December last. The capital raised for the railway amounted to 4,022,5861., and the expenditure to 3,981,3361., leaving a balance of 41,2601. The revenue on the railway amounted for the half-year ending the 31st of December to 121,776L, and tho expenses to 60,743M, leaving a balance of 61,0321. The revenue on the canal for the saine period amounted to 72,9281., and the expenses to 29,12., leaving a balance of 43,8041. These balances, added to 7,1731. London and North-Western account, make 112,0101., from which is deducted 60,5231, for preference and other charges, leaving a balance of 51,4871., of which the proposed dividend, at 31> per cent., will absorb 49,4611, The balance due by the London and North-Western C
pany is stated to be 67,94 under the 4 per cent, agreement.
RAILWAY BILLS IN PARLIAMIENT.
Yesterday the session for inquiring into the numerous bills in Parliament commenced in the Committee-rooms of the House of Commons before Mr. Smith, the senior examiniig barrister, and Mr. Frere, who has been appointed to fill the place recently vacated by Mr. May. There was the usual attendance of Parliamentary agents, 3o0icitors,hand. the general public interested in the progress of the various measures, the results of which were as follows
EAST KYOT.-To extend the line from Strood to St. AIary's Cray, with branch to Chatham Dockyard, for ranning powers and facilities over certain railways in Kent aud Surrey. Mr. Joseph Cnbitt estimated the expense of the extension line from Strood to join the Mfid-Kent Railway, with aUl necessary works, land, and contingencies, at 270,0001., and the expense of the branch to Chatham Dockyard at 14,0001. The standing orders were declared not complied with, on the ground of certain informalities,
FOiMARTLN1E AND BuCnAN.-To make a railway from the Great North of Scotland to Petorhead and Fraserburgh, at a cost of 370,0001.-Standing orders not complied with,
INVEnNSs ASD NAIRN.-For Dower to create a preference stock, and raise 25,0001.-St~anding orders complied with,
EXETEB. A-N-D EXmOuTvs.-To extend the time for the purchase of land and completion of works.-Standing orders complied with.
COhItvALL.-To securo the completion of the line between Plymouth and Truro, and to enable the Great Western, Bristol and Exeter, and South Devon ltailways to aid in doing so.-Standing orders compuled with.
ELY TWAL ILUtMOUR AND RAILWAY.-For a railway from the Ely Railway to the western side of the river Ely, improvement of the river, and construction of docks, at a cost of 192,0001.-Standing orders comlilied with,
READINGJUNCTIoX.-For powerto the Staines,Woklingham, and Woking Railway Company to make a railway to unite the Reading, Guildford, and RPeigate Railway with the Great Western Railway, and for facilitating transmission of traffic over Great Wostern Railway.-Standing orders complied with.
NLnp-y AND ENXNIsiLLEN.-To construct the line as far as Armagh.-Adjourned.
LLAINELLY AND LLANDILO.
In the account of the opening of this line for traffic which appeared in Tre lTimes of yesterday it was stated that the line bad been completed within the engineer's estimate of 8,0001. per mile. Mr. J. Samuel, the engineer, states that the cost of the line including land, works, stations, permanent way, sidings, law, engineering, and Parliamentary expenses, the electric telegraph, and, in fact, every item from its commencement to its opening for traffic, has not exceeded 6,8001. per mile, Considering that the liae, which is seven miles in length, embraces1S0,000 cubic yards of excavations, two over and four under road bridges, two parish road bridges, nine river bridges, one of which, over the river Towy, is of 150 feet clear span, and that all the bridges are either of wrought iron, cast iron, or masonry, and that the permanent way is laid in a substantial manner, with rails of 701b. to the yard, he thinks it must be admitted to be one of the cheapest lines ever made in this country. With regard to the Vale of Towy line, which will connect Llandilo with Llandovery, and form the first link in the main line from Manchester to Milford, he states that the works on it are now in an advanced state, and will be completed for less than 5,5001 per mile.

Distress Of Building Operatives.-A corre-
DrsrTsys oF BUiLDiLG O?ERATIVES.-A correspondent of the Bulidei writes :-" There are two great causes of the present want of employment for the building mechanic-the employment of capital in more profitable investments, and the conduct of the operatives themselves. Persons can now realize from fSve to six per cent. very readily upon loans, or merel by dposit at joint-stock banks, and therefore are not willing to be satisfied with four or five from buildws, encumbered with the business of mortgages or other securities; and unless interest is as low as that building operations cannot allow the builder any profit. And why is this 9 Materials are cbeaper than they used to be, and honses are no less in request; but the labour is so costly that it keeps sp the prico of production above the market value. Some years ago a first-rate carpenter, bricklayer, or mason would have been satisfied with his 4s., 4s. 6d., or at most 5s. a-day, but the artisan finding that building prospered, that there was a great demand for labour, immediately increased his
.laim for wages 3d. a-day, and then advanced again and again until at length the wages came to 5s. Gd. But, not content with the increase, they have claimed their Saturday bolyday. So that builders, if they yield to these large wages, can make no profit for their heavy outlay on labour, and can only realize something for themselves out of the materials. But this is not all, for the trade unions have been productive of immense injury. They prevent the builder from paying his worknen according to their respective merits, as they claim all to be paid by one standard -that is, the highest. They refuse to work with non. unionists; thus driving aU men, whether willing or not, to become unionists. In fact, the regalations of the unions are most oppressive tyranny to workmen and their employers, and have completely disorganized the relations wvhich once existed between the operatives and the emptoyera. These are, perhaps, hard truths; but they are traths, and well meant, and proceed from one whose interests are the same as theirs, and wvho has for them the kindest feelings of a fellowr-wrorkman in the buildinz trade."
h- AGED HEBRO IN D1STBESS.-HIOw ti-ty has it. been said that one half the world don't know how the other half live I In the Kirkgate of Alloa there resides a nan' named Malcolm Douglaq, who has attained the great age of 95 years. DouglWs father was a native of Blair-. gowrie, and was a sergeant in the 42d Highlanders. The subject of the present brief notice was bern in Gibraltar, and in early life served in the Royal Artillery, in E under the command of Colonel Douglas, And was It
not only when General Sir lalp. Abercromby died but was one of the moiurners at the funeral of that galant soldier. Douglas war in active service during the whole of the Peninsular var, and was engaged in the battlo of Waterloo. He attained the raRk of a sergeant, and was discharged in the year 1815. From some unexplained cause Douglu has no pension, and for a number of years he has resided in Abloa, earning a subsistence by collecting bones and rags. He is one of many in our town vho have lately been attacked with typhus fever, but he iR now out of danger, so far a that epidemic is conoerned. We are aware that Dr. Syme bas received one or two mall contributions from benevolent inhabitants on behalf of the poor man, and any trialing addition to these, intrusted either to Dr. Syme or to ourselves, may tend to increse the comfort if the closing days of the old soldier.-.Aloa Alds'erf.

LONDON, TUESDAY, JANUARY27, 1857.
An amnesty in the Lombardo-Venetian territory, a full pardon to all political prisoners, and a raising of the sequestration on the estates of fugitives, are events which will be variously estimated in this country. The common opinion no doubt is that, do what he may, an Emperor of ATsrnIA can never conciliate the Italian people. "We are " sorry for it," say one party, of Conservative instincts; "'we should be glad to see a strong "Austria, capable of holding its ground in "Central Europe; but to attempt to retain " Italy is to weaken the empire." The partisans of Italian independence come to the same conclusion, and announce it in tones of expectant triumph. Italy never can, never will be conciliated, and the Power that has domineered over it will one day yield either to force or to the necessities of the situation. Both parties, however, agree that the German and Italian cannot mix-cannot be fused into a whole, cannot even remain in their present state of hostile and distrustful contact. The lessons of history, the events of the present time, and the theories of race, are called as evidence against it. But, without entering into the question of the future destinies of Italy and the Austrian empire, we may at least express satisfaction at anything like an approach to moderation and good government. What is to be, what governments are or are not possible for different nations, are, after all, questions on which men argue pretty much from the actual aspect of things. The Italians are no doubt, as a body, disaffected to Austrian rule, but for the most part their discontent does not proceed from any innate antipathy or any patriotic desire for a united Italy, but from real and tangible grievances. The taxes are heavy, the military rule is severe, the restrictions on personal liberty galling. The Mlilanese of the present day are far more disloyal than their ancestors, simply because in the progress of the great system of military centralization the liberties of the province have been abridged, its burdens increased, and its old social dignities brought down to a common level of subserviency to a military and bureaucratic system. Partly through their owni weakness, partly from the arrogant and unconciiating spirit of Austrian rule, the Italians have become a discontented, disloyal people; severity has produced disaffection, and disaffection, in turn, has been the cause or pretext of new severity. We have before us the spectacle of a people undergoing the indignities which aw.ait the conquered when viewled with suspicion by their masters; taxed for the support of troops which occupy their country, and hampered in their dealings 'with one another and the world about them by the jealous spirit of an Imperial police. These are surely practical evils, and are sufficient to account for the notorious ill-will of the Italians,
without recourse to any theories about the natural antipathy of the Latin and Teutonic races, or the impossibility of Milan and Venice being contented so long as they are politically sundered from Florence, P3ome, and Naples.
The Emperor FB&CIS JOSEPH has taken a good resolution. Whatever may be the result, it is impossible to deny the credit due to the act which has just been accomplished. The number of political prisoners in the Lombardo-Venetian territory is stated at 115. Of these 7'0 are liberated; the others, it is said, are persons of obscure station and criminal lives, who, though condemned for the political offence of insurrection, were known to have taken part in the tumult for the purpose of plunder. It may be said, therefore, that the amnesty has been universal. The sequestration has been taken off the properties of all the refugees who have quitted the empire since the first troubles of 1848. Prosecutions for high treason and similar offences are discontinued, and the Special Court of Mantua is dissolved. Marshal RADETZIY has received orders to allow the return of all fugitives who will promise to live in tranquillity, and in the case of those who have become subjects of foreign States the Austrian Legations will interest themselves to procure their denaturalization, should it be desired. We learn by telegraphic despatch that the publication of the amnesty had produced great effect at Milan, that the city was spontaneously illuminated, and that the ERIPEROR and EnrpRss were received at the Scala with enthusiasm, which this time was not factitious.
We think that those moderate politicians who have at heart the sober happiness of mankind will join with us in satisfaction that the first great step has been taken for a more liberal and gentle administration of the Italian provinces. True, it would be better if Italy were independent and united, but, unhappily, this is not the case, nor, as far as we can see, is it likely to be the case, within our own time at least. WVe must therefore be satisfied for the present with the next best thing-the removal of practical gLievances, and the establishment of tl.:at security and personal well-being which are the first objects of government. It is certainly no small thing to end the dreary monotony of military repression. It will be a great achievement if, in v. few years, an English traveller cAul visit Those noble cities, and learn, from hi. porsonsl . 9S -ati-: that the people, though still jealous, tL £ . :
disinclined to welcome Austriant C ove. 4.. or associate freely with Austrian officers, are yet forced to own that things are ! t so bad as they were. We caino. expect any very rapid growth of sympathy; but certainly, when we consider the state of Europe generally, it will be something to
uarn that in Milan and Venice the army has been u, minished because people are no longer inclined for a revolt, that taxes are lessened because a sensible man has been put at the head of the finance, that passport regulations have become less stringent since the pedantry of the officials has been discouraged, and that society has been less gloomy and embittered since the insolence of the military class has been suppressed by the orders and example of its chiefs. These are benefits which it seems to us the inauguration of a better system may confer on Austrian Italy. They may not be the highest, but they are great and substantial, and the advance on the present state of things would be vast indeed.
,How far the Emperor of AuSTPrA intends to carry his reforms is, of course, unknown to the world; but if he has, either by his own judgment or through the advice of sound counsellors, resolved on a more conciliatory government in Italy, he certainly deserves the applause and encouragement of a free people. There can be no doubt that during his reign the Austrian empire has been centralized and strengthened, but it has been at the cost of many provincial liberties to which the people were attached. The disasters of 1848 made Austrian statesmen believe, perhaps justly, that the only hope of the empire was in the absolute supremacy of the central authority resting on a large and thoroughly disciplined army. To carry out this everything has been sacrificed-popularity, paternal goverunient, local constitutions, religious freedom. The end has been attained, and Austria is now a Power of greater European importance than at any former period. But it is bad policy to sacrifice for government the objects for which government is instituted, and Austria is now sufficiently secure to turn her attention to the amelioration and contentment of the populations subject to her sway. If it prove that the present amnesty has been the first step towards a better rule in the most civilized and interesting of her provinces, the visit of the EsrPr:Rot to Milan wiU not have been in vain.

There is a consistency in Mr. ROEBUCK's denun-
There is a consistency in Mr. ROEBUCK's denunciations which is suicidal. If you put on a pair of spectacles and saw a blue man you might think at first you had seen a very morbid subject; but when you found that everybody else was blue,-the houses blue, the fields blue, and the clouds blue,you would discover that the blue was in the spectacles. The attack defeats itself, because we are al driven to make a common cause against it, and nobody has so much reason to delight in this broadcast abuse as they who most deserve it. In fact, there is no place of society, no part of human nature, no condition left intact, to be the basis for a reasonable estimation of the rest or leaven for their improvement. There is no place for the hopeful reformer to set the sole of his foot upon; it's aU mud and slough, bog and quick-sand, filth and sludge. Where shall we begin ? What shaU be our starting-point when we wish to regenerate the rotten mass ? It is very true that MIr. ROEBuCK runs through the proper number of changes, and adapts his philippics to the class. Even through a pair of blue spectacles a brick house is a reddish blue, and a field a greenish blue; but in Mr. ROEBUCK'S eye the blue element of corruption pervades the whole group of British society, and we are al either principal actors, or accomplices, or instruments in a common knavery. The logical result of this partnership is rather serious, for it implicates everybody in the crimes of everybody else, though apparently and circumstantiaUy different from his own. The taxgatherer is always a rich man; the gold sticks to his fingers -that is, he either takes bribes from the taxpayer to wink at an imperfect return, or he actually embezzles some of the money passing through his hands, of course with the connivance of auditors, commissioners, and other functionaries over his head. Again, all contractors are rogues, and consequently so are all the highly responsible officials whose duty it is to check them. In aU these cases the responsibility of fraudulent practice mounts higher and higher, to the men who appoint and audit tlhe Commissioners of Taxes, and the clerks, superintendents, inspectors, surveyors, examiners, and other functionaries. When, with this converging evidence and necessary proof of corruption, we come at last to the picture of the Minister, whether surrounded by his satellites in public or in high domestic council, and find him sacrificing everything, even HEE
MAJSTY''s presence, to the purchase of votes, it is scarcely possible to extricate even the high-minded British statesman from complicity in the basest form of corruption. The man who appoints a relative or a friend to an office where he grows mysteriously rich, and can only do so by taking douceurs from contractors and taxpayers,
shares the guilt of his nominee, unless he cheeks and punishes it. According to Mr. ROanBuCi, there is no actual check; on the contrary, there is so little to choose between classes, that most probably there is a substantial community in the profits of corruption.
Now, we are very well satisfied that the whole class of British statesmen is far above such imputations. Were it put to Mr. RoE:ucX himself he would probably say as much. It is all the more unpardonable, then, to scatter general charges which may seem ridiculous to well-informed Englishmen, but which may be easily understood by the less informed, and by all foreigners, as charges of actual pecuniary corruption. No doubt, our statesmen have their share of human motives. They may be vain, or ambitious o, power, or overanxious to carry out favourite ideas, or bigots, or partisans; but for many generations there has not been even the suspicion of those crimes which tainted, for instance, the falling monarchy of Loeis PRiLiPPE. An English Premier or statesman of the first class always quits office even poorer than he entered it. He distributes bishoprics and other prizes that make the fortune of many a poor self-seeking soul, but he must himself be above money, office, titles, orders, and everything prized by ordinary men. His biographer would blush for him if he had to admit the least share of human infirmity in regard to these matters. If a Minister accepts even the priceless " K.G.," it is only because it is impolitic, and, in a word, " won't " do," to betray a slight of the highest rewards at the disposal of the Cnow,2. No onenot even Mr. RoEBucK-would suspect a Minister of vulgar cupidity; but, what is more, the class in this country has not that ambition for personal aggrandizement, for luxury and magnificence, that has almost uniformly characterized the statesmnen of France and other countries. It is fair, then, that they should have their due, and that a broad line should be drawn between them and the vulgar crowd. Mr. ROEBUCK is the more bound to guard his language from calumnious inferences, inasmuch as he lays down the universal rule that gold will stick to the fingers, and thousands will infer, and do infer, that it sticks to the fingers of those statesmei, who have most control over the public expencli'. ::e. It is not every palm that is invested with this mercurial property. How much of the public money stuck to the fingers of the two PITTS, of Fox, of PERCEVAL, of LIVERPOOL, of CANNING, of GREY, of MELBOVURYE, of RUSSELL, of PEEL, or of PAL?IERSTON ? We might add a score names of others who gained not one sixpence by office, and who diffused wealth on all sides only to fall back on their own diminished fortunes.
But, even with regard to the vast remainder, the class below class, the nobility and gentry, professions and trades, the general charge of corruption is worse than untrue--it defeats its own purpose. It damages the very people whom Mr. RO1EBUCK professes to patronize, and plays into the hands of the very persons whom he pretends to despise. It is true there are people with a very ill opinion of British political morality. There are people who never mention the public, or the constituency, or the raw Englishman, without an insinuation that he is a very base animal, only accessible to the lowest influences, and only to be operated on successfully that way. These people talk of the governing classes, the few highminded, high-bred, high-toned, high-disciplined families, as alone possessing the virtual secret of power. In the words of a certain sect, they pronounce " the people accursed." The British public, in their eyes, is a strong, unwieldy, restiff beast, with some good qualities, but occasionally playing tricks, kicking, running away, or coming to a standstill. In the end, however, macnge prevails, and the beast does its work. The only people who have that art of mswxge are the few of more celestial spihit or of purer clay. This is the theory of old Tory Ministers, and even of some l'hig statesmen. It is the theory of gouty old earls and bejewelled dowagers. It is also, to all appearance, Mr. ROEBUCX'S theory. He makes contractors, provincial functionaries, princely merchants, and generally the representatives of the people, mercenary, grovelling, and utterly wanting in self-respect. He tells us generally that it is our nature to " fall down on our bellies," to crawl in the dust, before stripling lords. He tells us that they are our natural masters, and that none other can have effectual dominion over us. He tells us that there is no virtue in the British soul, even in that of the " merchant prince," that wiUl not melt into the common element of the aristocracy. He taunts all lower classes with the truth of the insults lavished on them by the higher. lWhich side is he taking here ? In effect he takes the side which he proclaims naturally the most powerful, the most independent, the most attractive, the most certain to survive and win the day in all collisions with other classes. If testimony is now wanted by those who disparage the " people" of England, in the more popular sense of that word, it is supplied by
Mr. ROEEUCK.
But, while exaggeration is not the way to establish any truth, depreciation is not the way to raise any class to a higher level. The way to win a race is to look at those who are before, not to calculate the probability of this or that competitor being distanced. By the time we have arrived at the comfortable conclusion that aU our neighbours are as bad as can be we shaU trust to maintain our own comparative superiority by continuing what we are. A low estimate is a low standard, and the worst thing that can happen to us is to live in a vulgar sphere, even if the vulgarity be only in our own imagination. No doubt, there is always ground enough for thinking ill of everybody about us. No doubt, Mr. A. is a moneygetting man of business; Mr. B. is a man of pleasure; Mr. C. is a coxcomb; Mr. D. is a fool; Mr. E. is il-tempered; Mr. F. is moody and dull ; Mr. G. is a crazy fanatic; Mfr. H. is a sour Puritan; Mr. J. is vulgar; Mr. K. is a tufthunter; Mr. L. is queer; and so on through the alphabet, or half-adozen alphabets; and, according to our tone of minds, it may be quite possible to hate or despise any or all of these memn But when we have done
so who is the greatest loser? Of course, we are, who find ourselves in a world, though a world of our own, that elicits from us no feelings of love or respect; that kindles no glow of sympathy or admiration; that provokes no generous rivalry; that 'presents no model, and provides not even an audience or spectators for virtue. Mr. RoEBucK may, for aught we know, be that which the ancient Stoics felt,-thealtrtm sibi, and lhe may find in his inner sense and secret consciousness stimulus enough for the most heroic and most constant exertions. But the majority of mankind lose nearly all their aids to commnon goodness when they have ceased to respect, and therefore to love, their feUow-countrymen and their species. That is the too usual penalty of satire, whether in its lighter or in its graver forms. No; let us al, if not for others, at least for ourselves, for our own common nature, endeavour to think as well as we can of one another. Let us admire the honest industry of Mr. A., and the lively humour of Mfr. B. Let us honour Mr. C.'5 attempts to make the best of himself, and Mr. D.'s simple and affectionate nature. We shall find in them all something to admire, and, even to
imitate. " If we imagine no worse of them than " they of themselves, they may pass for excellent " men." We must indeed be very unfortunately placed if we cannot make up one decent model out of a whole company ; but, be they ever so bad, they have far more claims to our pity than to our contempt.

The case of "DAVISON v. DUNCAN," which
The case of " DA,isoN v. DuxcAu," which occurs in our law report of last Saturday, resuscitates a question which we had hoped had long since been at its final rest.
It appears that there exists at Hartlepool a smaU local parliament, having large powers over that busy borough. We have not read the statute under which they act, but, judging from their title, " The West Hartlepool Im" provemen' Commissioners" can probably pull down anybody's house, or pull up anybody's sewer, or stop up anybody's road. That they can imposetaxesuponallthe propertyin Hartlepool appears upon the face of the proceedings; and, even if this were the sole amount of their power, it might appear to justify some curiosity in the inhabitants of this town as to what the Commissioners were saying, and what they were likely to do. To satisfy this very natural curiosity on the part of the people of Hartlepool, the local newspapers published reports of the meetings of the Hartlepool Commissioners; and so it happened that no man's house was puUed downi in Hartlepool, and no man's sewer was puUed up, and no man's rates were doubled, without those coming events duly casting their shadows before. This happy state of things continued for some time, but these Improvement Commissioners, quite naturally,-for it is the nature of Commissioners so to do,-got into a squabble with a neighbouring power. Collectively they passed some strong resolutions, and individuaUy they used fierce wordswords unpleasant to the ear of an absent gentleman. The absent gentleman was indignant that such harsh things should be said of him, and he looked about for somebody to punish. Rapidly singling out his victim, he brought his action, not against Mr. Commissioner A. or M1r. Commissioner B., but against the local newspaper which had reported what they said. This proceeding was very much the same as if a man should see by the aid of a looking-glass that some one was shalking his fist and making other insulting gestures at him behind his back, but should straightway, irstead of turning round and knocking down his adversary, raise his walking-stick and demolislh the looking-glass. However, the action was brought, and the defendant pleaded that the report was a fair report of the proceedings at a public meeting, and that the report was without malice. To this plea the plaintiff demurred; that is to say, he admitted (for the purpose of the action) that the facts were true, but denied that they amounted to a defence. The Court of Queen's Bench, without hearing argument,-for the running conversation between the defendanfs counsel and the Court cannot be called an argument,-and without taking any time to consider the point, decided that the plaintiff's demurrer was good, or, in other words, that there is no protection for a fair report of the proceedings of a public body.
Now, we very respectfully represent to the Court of Queen's Bench that this case of " DAvisoN v. DuNcANx" deserved a little more time and attention than it received at their hands. The principle involved in it is certainly not less important than the principle involved in that great commercial case wherein the Courts have just confessedly miscarried. The judgment in " DA" viSso- v. DuNqc,' should not have been given without grave deliberation upon patiently heard argument. We venture to predict that whenever some case similar to this shall be fuly argued and wel considered this judgment will be thought to be but doubtful law. We wil give our reasons for this opinion, and they shall be strictly such as lawyers should listen to.
At the end of the last century the press was an outlaw. A newspaper was a thing held in equal hatred and terror by the Bench. It was an established principle of law that it had no privileges, and judges authoritatively ruled that " it was no " part of the duty of the editor of a newspaper to " report judicial proceedings; he was a volunteer, " and did so at his own risk." We slould not carry the attention of the reader with us if we were to deduce through the various cases the gradual changes in the spirit of judicial decisions upon this important point. Gradualy, and step by step, the exigencies of the public won from the Courts a reluctant assent to the proposition that a fair and bo7 fide report of judicial proceedings was as much protected as the character of a servant, or an answer to an inquiry made by one man of business of another. At present the law, so far as it respects judicial proceedings, is indisputable. WlTe will refer to some of the later cases. Lord CA.%tPBaLL, in " ANxDRws v. CHAP" airx," reported in the third volume of Carri?vgton and Kirwan's Reports, told the jury that "by the "law of England a fair account of what takes "place in a court of justice may be published," and that the privilege of publishing reports of proceedings in courts of justice is " a valuable pri" vilege for the public." Mr. Justice COLERIDGE, in the case of " SAIITH V. S.IITI," reported in the second volume of Ga7rinrton and Kirican's Reports, directed the jury thus :-"If this libel is a cor" rect account of proceedings in a court of justice, " you ought to find a verdict for the defendant." In the case of " EOARE v. SILVERLOOK," reported in the ninth volume of the Common. Bench Reparts, Chief-Justice WILDE and aU the Puisne Judges of that court solemnly decided that a report of proceedings in a court of justice was a protected publication. " I think it impossible," said Mr. Justice MAULS, "at this day to say that a " fair account of proceedings in a court of justice, " not being ex p)arte, but in the hearing of both "sides, is not, generally speaking, a justifiable "publication."
Now, we presume that these decisions and those which preceded theem to the same effect depend upon some principle. A decision which has no principle to authorize it is valueless. Lord CAMDEN has told us, in stronger language than we should care to use upon our own unaided authority, that the discretion of Judges, unguided by principle, is no better than caprice. We find a principle active in all these cases, and recognized in several of them. In " FLrA;T v. PncE," reported in the fourth volume of Barnwall and Cresswell's Reports, it is thus enounceda:-"Tbe publication shonld "be for the purpose of giving the public information "which it is fit and proper for them to receive." In Sir JoHN CAM1PBELL'T elaborate argument in the
case of " STOCKDALE 'V. IIANSASD a host of authorities are cited by that very learned and careful Attorney-General to prove his proposition that
"publications for the good of the community have "been held privileged; " and in Lord CAUrPBELL'S own Libel Act the same principle is recognized in that it is made part of the averment of the plea given by that statute "that it was for the public "benefit that the said matters charged should be "published.".
Now, if this be the principle upon which reports of judicial proceedings are protected, we ask confidently, what public advantage can srise from a report of judicial proceedings which does not equally arise from a report of the proceedings of public hodies which have the power of taxation in their hands ? What interest have the public in knortiig the isaue in the vase of " No= v,
"I SrYS"X which they have not in knowing whether their houses are to be pulled down or whether their taxes are to be trebled? The immunity as to judicial proceedings cannot be an isolated exception; for it must then have depended upon some statute. It must proceed from some general principle, and that general principle is the public good. Wherever that principle leads the decision of the Courts, in common. sense and in sound law (which we are told is the perfection of common-sense), ought to follow. There is as much difference between tle old case in the "M Aodern Reports," wherein it was held that to print a writ of prohibition was a libel, and the decision in " HOABE V. SxLvErLocy," which we have mentioned, as there is between the decision in the case of I "DAvisoN V. DmNc,AN`7 and that which the convenience of modern society demands.
In truth, a newspaper report is but an expansion of the area through which a voice can travel. The reporter does no more than give to the absent to read what those present have heard. If there is guilt in the speech- adest qzi fecit, to punish the reporter is as insensate as it would be to punish the audience. We ask no impunity for malice, no protection for partiality, no amnesty for gross negligence occasioning private wrong; but we think we are entitled to demand that important public duties, the discharge of which is absolutely necessary to the qe+r-day business of society, should not expose \te Press to constant persecution and wanton annoyance. It is said that " hard cases make bad law." Perhaps there may have been nomething in the facts of this case which may have led the Court to some inference adverse to the defendant. If so, it was the plaintiffs fault that he placed his case in such a form before the Court that the malice or bonafides of the report could not be tried. This little considered judgment, however, affects all alike-it is burning down a forest to destroy one bad tree.

tA sUSnary of the following, received by electric tele4raph, appeared in our second edition of yesterday :--
LIVERPOOI, JAN. 26.
'The Royal mail steamship Niagara, Wyckmana Colmmander, arrived this morning from Boston, vi1 Halifax, with dates from that port to the 14th, New York to the 13th, and by telegraph s,i Halifax to the 15th inst.; 90 passengers, and $255,986 in specie on freight.
The Royal mail steamship Asia, hence, arrived at -Wew York on the 12th, and the United States' mail steamship Ericsson on the 13th inst.
The screw steamship Anglo-Saxon, hence, had arrived at Portland,
In the House of Representatives Mr. Kelsey *called attention to charges of corruption that have been publicly made against the integrity of some of its members by the New Yorkl Times, and moved a resolution caUing for an investigation. This was met, at the outset, by the usual attempt to zneer the whole thing out of countenance, by stig. matizing it as only a " newspaper assertion." Aneother member, however,-Mr. Paine-asserted that lie knew the charge to be substantiaUy true ; that -a distinct proposition was mnade to him by a member of the House of Representatives, for a vote in favour of the Minnesota Land Bill, and that 11,600 were prornised for such a vote. He 'furthermore declared his readiness, if caUed *upon, to give his testimony upon that subject. Investigation was resolved upon. A biUl for reducing 'the duty on imports and for other purposes had been introduced by Mr. Campbell, of Ohio, who *sas in general terms that the committee contemplate bringingdowvn the high schedules, and either abolishing or raising the low ones. lMr. Florence gave notice of an amendment, namely, that aU goods or articles of manufacture unfinished, and generaly denominated or known as goods in the gray grease, of which the tissues are combed wool, and of -which the chain and fillina are wool,such asmerinoes, snousselines, delaines, cashineres, and satins ; and also, those the tissues of which and the chain are of silk and the filling of wool, such as barbaes and -satins, be hereafter admitted on paying a duty of 10 per cent. ail valorem. Mr. Slorrill also offered an amendment-that any wool or hair of the alpaca, the goat, and other like animals, which shall be changed in its character for the purpose of evading the auty, or which shall be cleaned or purified or assorted so as to raise its value at the port of importation to 50 cents Der pound or over, or which shall be reduced in vlue by the admixture of dirt or any foreign substance, to 15 cents per lb., or less, shall be subject to pay a duty of 30 per cent.
The New York Board of Councillors had resolved to give an oflicial welcome to the oflicers of Her Majesty's ship Retribution in the event of their .arriving there. One red-hot Republican councillor opposed the motion on the ground that he did not like the idea of paying honour to Queen Victoria. 'The offlicers of the Brooklyn navy yard are preparing to give the Britishers a warm reception. The press, too, is unanimous in expressing friendly sentiments towards this country for its reception of Captain Hartatein.
The satisfaction expressed by a large number of -the Americani press at the erroneously rumoured -appointment of the Hon. C. P. Villiers as British Minister to Washington had elicited from theNe7c York Timeos some sarcastic remarks. TJnder the *heading "Slightly Snobbish" it says-
W We fear that the congratulatory remarks which have been made by mnany of our cotenmporaries in relation to the new British Minister to this counltry vill cause us to be iaughed at by Mrs. Grundy on the other side of the Atlantic. it seems to he regarded as a special subject of rejoicing that the new Minister is a man of rank and connected by blood with the peerage. The fact of Mr. Villiers being the -brother of Lord Clarendon appears to give him peculiar claims to di.tinction, and it is taken for granted that he is a statesman of the highest order of intellect. The Philadelphia Ledger says .-
" ' The appointment of Mr. ViUiers is of a higher grade 'and order of intellect than has heretofore been usuaUy sent -to represent Great Britain at Washington. This shows likewise that our national importance begins to assume its proper estimate in the eyes of Europe. The skill and address with which our recent negotiations were conducted with England have convinced the Mlinistry of the necessity to be represented here by men distinguished by social, political, and intellectual qualifications.'
The facts of the matter do not bear out these assumptions. Except in the case of Mr. Crampton, England has been as ably represented at Washingioii as in a.ny Co'rt of Europe, and her American Ambassadors have been as well connected as Mr. Villiers. The niost able of living English -diplomatista, Lord Stratford de l.edcliffe, was many years blinister at Washington; Lord Ashburton was sent as a special Ambassador. Mr. Fox was a relative of Lord Holland and of the celebrated Charles James Fox, and Sir Henry Bulwer belongs to as good a family as that of Mr. Villiers besides being a relative by marriage of the Duke of WeUington and distinguished both in literature and polities. We have no intention of disparaging the claims of the new Minister to our favourable consideration either on the score of his own personal character, or that of his family connexions; but we do not see that there is anything about his appointment that particularly calls for felicitations; and least of aU is it becoming in us to pay any special deference to himn because he happens to be the relative of a Lord."
On the same subject the New York Jouutsl of Commerce remarks:-
"Cordial and abundant as have been the manifestations of good andl generous feeling on the part of Great Britain towards this country on the occasion of the restoration of the Resolute to H-er Majesty, and acceptable as this warmhearted appreciation of Amenrcan courtesy and good-will maust prove to the American people, the recent official announcement made to our Government of the formal renewal of diplomatic relations between the two countries by the appointment of Mr. Villiers, as British Ambassador at Washington, must enhance the :satisfaction, obliterating as it does every vestige of unpleasantness which our late uinternational differences may have occasioned.
"This wolcoume to the men who conveyed the derelict vessel bask to those who had despatched her on a mission of philxathropy and scienti6c research; the graoeEal courtesy of the worthy and amiable lady who occupies the most exalted station min theocountry; the assiduous and fliattering attentions of the Government officials; the private hospitality, and the honiest cheers with which the British people greeted our hravo sailors, will be remembered long after the ' Central Ammerican Difficulty,' the ' Enlistment Qaestion,' the 'Dissmiisal of Mr. Crampton,' aud the quarrels of diplomatists shaUl have been forgotten. If it were possible ta suggest any additional mark of friendship in the acknow edgment of what an Emiglish journal styled the 'Message of Peace,' which we sent to our kindred across the Atlantic, it has been shown us in the most acceptable fori,i by the British Government, in availing themsisolves of this occasion to renew our partially suspended diplomatic intercourse, and restore the relations of the two countries to tbat footing of cordiality so congenial to their generous feelings and so eEsential to their mutual prosperity.
" The newly appeinted Minister to Washington has had considerable experience, possesses a high order of talents, and a framik, kindly disposition, is courteous and affable in mannes, and was honourably distinguished in Parliament as one of thoss who brought about the great coeminercial reforms of 1846. Never did a Minister enter upon the duties of his office under more auspicious circumstances. All niatters of difference and dispute have been happily and satisfactorily adjusted, and the best anid most amicable feeling subsists between the Governments and people of the two countries. His duties, therefore, wil be as grateful as the welcome he wiUl receive will be hearty, from all classes of our com3nunity. It may he that he wiU conie in the war-steamer appointed by the British Adniiralty to bring back Captain Hartstein and his men; but whether this be so or not, we hope that occasion will be taken to reciprocate to the officers of the Iletribution, when they reach our shores, the many courtesies show to the olBfcers of the Resolute, and that nothing will be left undone to make their stay in this eountry agreeable aud worthy of their comnplimnentary mission."
At New York a movement was on foot to establish a hospital for inebriates.
The Governor of Pennsylvania says that the financial condition of the Comnionwealth is highly satisfactory, and that for the fiscal year ending November 3U, 180t;, the receipts of the Treasury have been $ih3,621,'937 64c.; the total expenditures for the salme peiiod, ,377,142 22c., leaving a balance
in the ' re; snry, Decem ber 1, $8t 1,244,795 42c 'Tlhe Governor adds, that the interest on the funded debt, whichl fell due in February and August last,
was then paid, and that which becomes duo in
February next will be paid with equal promptness, -out of available means now in the Treasury. The punctuality Nwith which the interest on the public -debt has been paid, and the ability of the Treasury to meet all legitimate demands upon it, have inspired public confidence in the State securities, and contributed largely to establish and sustain the -credit of the commonwealth.
The Gorernor of Ohio in his message states that the receipts of the Statefor the year were$3,538,353, aPs,i the expenditures $3,189,600, being less by
-$380,665 than for the year preceding, and leaving a balance in the Treasury of $579,353. The Reciprocity Treaty with Canada has enlarged the field and stimulated the activity of mercantile enterprise, especially in the northern part of the State. The report of the Comminssoners of the Sinking Fund, not yet completed, will, he says, "give full information in relation kO their proceedings under the act of April 8, 1856. authorizing a new loan for the payment of the debt of $2,423,359 79c., pay.
able atthe pleasure of the State afterthe15thinrt ''To guard against a necessity for new loans the Governor suggests the expediency of providing, by seasonable
and suitable leoislation, for the debt of $6,413,325, which will be payable after 1860. In view of the condition of the Sinking Fund he recommends the levy of a suflicient rate upon the grand list to restore to the Sinking Fund the sums which have been transferred from it or in any other way devoted to other uses, and to increase it to the fuU extent of the constitutional requirement; also such legislation as wUl insure the future reservation of the entire fund from every use, exceptthat of paying the interest and principal of the public debt, and the safe investment of that part speedily applicable to the reduction of the principal until wanted for that purpose.
The Governor of the State of Massachusetts in his annual message to the Legislature states that the expenditures of 1856 were about $1,400,000, showing a surplus of receipts of about $117,000. The estimated floating debt of the State at the end of 1S57 is placed at about $700,000. He urgaes economy in every department. He is forcibly American in commenting upon foreign born voters. " Still, so far as the decision of the Presidential election is final," he says,-
" So far as the action of the present is inevitably developed in imumeasurable and incomprehensible consequences and influences on the future, sud so far as a step has been taken which it may require a generation to efface, our citizens have the bitter assurance of knowing that that decision, that action was fixed and that step taken by the casting votes of aliens born, aliens unnaturaized and aliens entirely ignorant of our institutions and grossly callous to the vast interest involved in this stupendous issue. While this herd of foreign-born votes has thus strickendown anoble cause, which appealed to the moral sentiment and enlightened patriotism of our country, it only affords another confirmation of a fact which otr whole history establishes, that the foreign vote, with hardly an exception, always has been, and in the nature of things will and must be, attracted to that party which, under the hibh-soundin- generalities on the abstract right of man, always practically co-operates with slavery at the South, and banishes from Its platform the moral questions and nobler instincts and more enlightened sextiments of the ago."
The message of the Governor of Indiana slhows the expenses of the State Government for 1853 to have been $147, 42 G1c.; and for 1856, $59,522 63c. lle recommends the passage of a law for the reappraisement of the landed property for taxable purposes. The entire amount of the funded debt of the State outstanding of the Five per Cent. stock is $5,156,560 ; and of the Twoand-a-Half per Cent. stock, $1,812,517.
The New York Times complains that one of the fashionable eccentricities of the day which have sprung from the rapid intercourse that has been established between EuroDe and the United States is eating English mutton. No dinner is now considered perfect without a saddle or a leg of English mutton, brought by the last steamer. English mutton is not only served at all the restaurants and public hotels, but at the tables of private houses.
An association to promote emigration to the Pacific had been formed at New York.
The Slackeille (Miss.) Adrocate gives the particulars of a very cold-blooded and determined murder. Burns, the proprietor of an hotel, had quarrelled with a Dr. Stovall and blows were exchanged. Soon afterwards Ltovall was driving past Burns' stable, and, seeing him engaged harnessing a horse, pulled up and walked towards Burns. He beckoned to a negro who was standing near to get out of the wvay, at the same moment raising the gun and firing. At the instant of his firing, Burns, looked around and received the contents of the gun full in his face. He raised his hands to his eyes and sunk to the earth, exclaiming, "My God !" Upon this Stovall advanced within ten paces and fired the second time, the whole charge takdng effect in h:s back; and Burns then cried out, "I am a dead man !" Still not satisfied, Stovall coolly approached him, and drawing a pistol, put it close to his head and fired again, bursting his eyeball from its socket; then putting the pistol to his breast, he fired a fourth time into the body of the already dead man Mrs. Burns and her children rushed from the house screaming, while StovaU coolly walked away, got into his buggy, and drove off.
According to the Quebec C1ironicle, the Five Great Lakes of North America have recently been surveyed, and it is found that they cover an area of 90,000 square miles. The total length of the five lakes is 1,534 miles. Lake Superior, at its greatest length, is 356 miles; its greatest breadth is 160 miles; mean depth, 988 feet; elevation above the sea, 627 feet; area, 32,000 square miles. Lake Michigan is 360 miles long; its greatest breadth is 108 miles; its mean depth is 900 feet; elevation, 687 feet; area, 20,000 square miles. Lake Huron, in its greatest length, is 200 miles; its greatest breadth is 1 60 miles; mean depth, 300 feet; elevation, 574 feet; area, 20,000 square miles. Lake Erie is 250 miles long; greatest breadth, 80 miles; mean depth, 200 feet; elevation, 555 feet; area, 6,000 square miles. Lake Ontario has a length of 180 miles, and its mean breadth is 65 miles; mean depth, 500 feet; elevation above the ocean, 262 feet; area, 6,006 square miles.
The accounts from Kansas continue to report dissension. Seven of the members of the Free State Legislature had been arrested, and more arrests were expected to take place. Governor Robinson had resigned.
The steamship George Law had arrived at New York from nspinwall with the Californian mails of the 20th December and $1,250,000 on freight. According to these advices the steamer Sierra Nevada had left San Juan with a large number of recruits for *Valker; previously to her departure an attempt was made to sink her.
The mining news from California is favourable. There had been large arrivals of merchandise at San Francisco, and the markets were overstocked and dull. The Supreme Court had recommended the repudiation of the State debt, all but $300,000, onthe ground that it was unconstitutional. They advise the adoption of the debt by the Legislature, "the question of repudiation tobe submittedto thepeople." No transfer of stock had been made since the decision. The people, however, were " opposed to repudiation, and meetings had been held in various parts of tbe State to give expression to the public opinion." At a meeting held in San Francisco resolutions were, it is reported, passed, pledging the redemption of the debt, which is $3,000,000 m amount. The Court had also decided that "' a million and a- half scrip, issued by the old corporation was illegal" It had also " decided a suit brought by a purchaser of city slip property for the recovery of money paid to the city, the sale having since been declared illegal." The amount in dispute was $1,200,000. Another decision of the Court was, "that the city is not liable for the $375,000 for a lot purchased by country biddings."
Mexican advices report that Alvarez had declared his intention of supportingComonfort'sGovernment. The Government and revolutionary forces had been engaged at Orizaba ; the defeat of the latter and the loss of their artillery, &-c., was the result.
The advices from Nicaragua are brief. Canas, the commauder of the Costa Rican forces, was reported to be near or in Rivas with 600 men. WValker had 400 men at St. George, a mile or two from Rivas. Canas had intimated his intention of immediately attacking the Filibusters if they did not take the initiative. The allied force numbered 2,000 men; reinforcements were expected, Large contributions of money, horses, mules, clothing, and provisions for the use of the allies had been made by the natives. WYalker's forces did not, it is said, exceed 800 men.
From Oregon we learn that hostilities had occurred at Puget Sound between the United States' steamer Massachusetts and the Tndians. After 27 Indians
had been killed and 21 wounded they gave in. The steamer lost only one man.
The New York commercial adcvices report an improvement in monetary matters, but while money was easier there was a somewhat increased demand.
There was but little difliculty in finding money for stock loans if the security is satisfactory. Paper, however, shows no improvement, and the supplywas rather pressing. The rates were 7 per cent. on call, and 9 to 10 per cent. for short first-class paper. The bank statement showed a more enlarged line of discounts than at any period since August last. The stock-market, favourably influenced by the increased supply of money and by the recent intelligence from Europe, was firm, with a moderate business for the leading fancies at improving prices. At the second board there was also an upward tendency in prices and a firm market. Foreign exchanges were rather unsettled, the large dealers being anxious both to buy and sell, and keep their quoted rates as low as possible. Bills on
London were quoted at 1081 to 108a; on Paris 5 231 to 5 20 ; and on Hamburg, 361 to 36g. The cotton-market was heavy and dull, but there was no alteration of moment in quotations. The opinions on the subject of the new crop remain unchanged. Flour had advanced from IOc. to 15c. per barrel, with a goo demnand. Wheat was held with great flrmnesst and. Indian coas had an upward tendency.
Pork ~ firm and acY , as was also beef. There was liiiti doing in. usalv stores, owing to holderd

Emigration.
EMIGRATION.
TO TIlE EDITOR OF THrE TIMES.
Sir, -Your witty leader of Wednesday last on the Smithfield meetings, and your article of to-day on paupers and poorhouses, acknowledge that emigration is the remedy for the evil under which our working masses desperately labour, and which every right-thinking man, however great his wealth or high his station, mnst anxiously long to see at once mitigated and, as speediy as possible, completely removed.
On Monday last I made my way into the Smithfield crowd, and, while Messrs. Pierce and Macheath were urging their hearers to demand certain so-called political rights, with allotments of heath and bog, and to march in close column, led of conrse by Brigadiers Macheath and Pierce, on the parish bread stores, I was telling that portion of the meeting within reach of my voice, that men of their stamp were at a high premium in Australia and New Zealand; that by going out to those colonies they would secure high wages and abundance of the necessaries of life; that their enterprise and industry productively employed would greatly improve the position of their working brethren in this country, and achieve for themselves and their children comparative independence. I told them that the command of two good mreals of meat a-day was of more importance to them and their families than universal suffrage ; that members of the middle and upper classes were to be found in all parts of the habitable globe-emigrants from necessity or the manly love of enterprise; that I had two young brothers working their way in Australia, had myself been in the West Indies, and contemplated settling in Canada or at the antipodes.
Well, I must allow that, with the exception of one long. haired youngDemocratwho olamouredforwasteland athome, but was unable to inform me of what use to him would be a section of Dartmoor, my hearers were disposed to think a free passage to Melbourne or Nelson better worth agitating for than the privilege of voting for the most brilliant member of the Administrative Reform Association; and I am sare that had Mr. Secretary Labouchere been with me he would have wept with vexation as he reflected that the narrow policy and miserable restrictions of our Government emigration system prevented his offering a free passage (for it is but mockery to ask such men to contribute towards the expense) to the hundreds of the idle yet able, and, let me add, cheerful and well-disposed young and middle-aged men I saw around me.
There are thousands of men and women, not in this metropolis alone, but throughout our manufacturing and agricultural districts, half-fed examples of how thoroughly the great unalterable principles of political economy are understood and acted upon by their thrifty employers, whose arrival in the great colonies I have mentioned would be joyfuRly hailed; who by their natural right, as wel as by their patient toil and noble endurance, claim to be conveyed at the expense of the Stateto those distant yet fertile provinces of the empire where they can really live by the sweat of the brow, where they may rejoice and not weep over the children born to them, and where they wil become a source of strength and honour, instead of weakness and danger to the mother country-branches not exhausting, but nourishing the stately old tree.
Strongly as justice demands a fuU and free measure of emigration, not the less logicaUy does policy recommend it. The farmer, the manufacturer, the builder are apt to attach too much importance to a low rate of wages.
What enables the employer in Australia and New Zealand to pay easily and happily double and treble the price for labour the best hands receive in this country ? Why, the circumstance that, as a settler in a new, lightl- taxed country, where land-the great source of wealth-is marvelously cheap, he has great compensating advantages. So, compensating advantages will enable the employer in this country to pay easily and cheerfuUy much higher wages when a proper system of emigration has done its good work. Poor-rates will sink to zero ; the charges for police and prisons wiiU be diminished in a corresponding ratio; for, are not want and crime, in a great degree, convertible terms 9
Every colonist wiU be a profitable customer to the British manufacturer, emigration will stimulate and sustain the trade of our commercial towns, and great wiU be the demand for beef, bread, and beer to be supplied by our prosperous farmers, who wil find that the cheapest labour they can have is the well-fed, honest, happy peasant to whom through the beneficial influence of a wise anI liberal system of emigration, they, will I trust, be ere long compelled to pay a mintimum rate of 3s. a-day.
I remain, Sir, your most obedient servant.

France And Russia.
FRANCO AND BUSSIA.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Russian agents fly over France at this moraent to show and convince political men that the alliance with England is against the nature of French policy, and that only the Russian alliance is its right stages. The geatleman who, last Monday, published his letter in that sense in your newspaper must be one of them; then his arguments are indeed very wrong, and against the political things in France. He says that no Orleanist or Napoleonist likes England, and wishes the alliance with Russia. That is just the contrary. We detest Russia, and all classes of the French people are convinced that an alliance with Russia must be the decadence of Franee. Then, Russian political principles and French political ideas are as different as the day to the night, as right to falsehood, iustice to injustice, liberty to slavery, independence to despotism.
Russia and its party like, of course, the allianoc with France, because they hope to do one day with France what they have done with Poland. Austria and Prussia give their hands to that plan, and they hope, with the Russian oppression in France, by an alliance to tear the country. That is the only result which we can have from such political combination. Then to profit by an international free relation, so aS by navigation and the commerce, &c., with Russia, we have no hope for It. The Russian Government will not change its system of oppression in favour of France or any other country. The high Russian duties on merchandise and vessels of foreign countries in Russia-the non-liberty of trade and of travelling-the bad justice, and the corrupted national institutions in that country-all these things wil not be changed in favour of France if it enters into an alliance with Russia.
Russia will gain, but not give; it will impose its system on other peoples and come to a universal reign by destroy - lng the other nations; and therefore the Rusian diplomacy must act under all false remedies to come to the bottom.
We like openly the alliance with England because England gives us a guarantee just the contrary of a Russian friendship; and while gogland, profiting on the other side by the liberal French national institution, being in a fast friendship with France, can do weU to eiviliza. tion by the destruction of the diplomatical plans nourished by Russian corruption against a loyal, humane, and just government of the nations, Russia cannot suffer such a government in her country, and therefore she will prevent liberty and justice in the governments of other countries, or put down tho other nations.
These, Sir, are realy the general political sentiments of the French population, excepting, perhaps, the partisans of Henry V. But these Frenchmen are not French by their national feeling; they are Russian, because they hope that one day Russia will come to Franee and help them in their plans and bring Henry V. to the throne. It is a shame for civilization to hope anything from Russia; but there are French, as well as English, Germans, &a., who are blnded by Russian gold, and wish to give to Russia a role of mediation in their country. This treachery must be overwatched if we would not come into a decadence and under the Russan foot.
I beg the insertion of this letter in your newspaper in answer to the letter which was produced last Monday, and I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your moat obedient servant.

(FROX OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.)
NEW YORK, JAN(. 12.
The Legislative business at Washington has been varied and enlivened this week by a collision between the press and the House of Representatives. For some time the growing influence of what is called the " lobby" has been a prominent subject of disCusion in the New York journals, and the exposure of the different forms of seduction brought to bear on the members on behalf of pending bills has been rather edifying to the public than pleasant to those concerned. The chief objects for which that undefined power, the " lobby," exerts itself are the Pacific Railroad BiUs, renewals of the terms of valuable patents, the proprietors of which can afford a liberal outlay of money among those who reaUy have influence or can induce the belief that they possess it, and bils alienating large grants of public lands in different States and territories to encourage the construction of railroads. There are many minor schemes in which individuals are more interested than the public or any section of it, as every claim on the Treasury, if settled, must pass the Legislature in the shape of a bill. That such bills should be made the subjects of a pretty active canvass among the members is natural, and, from the nature of things, unavoidable; and this canvass for support and votes is what has aroused suspicion and criticism. The arguments by which the members are influenced in some cases are said to be too direct, too solid-in fact that they consist of bribes. Ai long as the discussion was confined tothe ground of abstract morality, dealt in general assertions only, and produced some rather highly coloured descriptions of society in Washington as illustrations, no notice was taken of the matter. But in referring to the prospects of the Minnesota Land BiU, conveying to certain parties grants of land in that territory a3 the basis for running a railroad through it, ihe Net York Times was more than usually specific in its attack on the system, and an hon. member handed in the article to the clerk of the House of Representatives, and moved that it be read and made the subject of an investigation as a question of privilege. The article aUleged that gross corruption had been practised to obtain votes in support of the Minnesota Land Bill, and that it would not be difficult to prove it by conclusive evidence. The motion naturaly excited a storm; there was a perfect burst of virtuous indignation on aU sides, and the whole institution of the press was abused in that lofty style of contempt that has sometimes been heard elsewhere. The House was advised not to invest the newspapers with the kind of respectability that would be given them by any notice of the charge, with much angry speech of the same kind. But here too, as elsewhere, the denunciations of the " ribald press" received an unexpected confirmation that changed the whole state of the case, and put the indignants on their self-defence. Mr* Paine, of Nortb Carolina, declared from his own experience that, so far from the charges being false and calumnious, he had very good reason to believe they were quite true; that there had been negotiations of the kind to insure the passing of the Minnesota Land Bill, for he had himself been offered $1,500 for his vote in favour of it. This direct asserti on, backed by the offer to prove it in evidence before a comnuittee of inquiry, had an immediate effect on the discussion. The charge coming from a member of the House could be entertained without loss of dignity, though scouted with contemptuous denial when it was confined to "lampblack and rags," as one member happily observed. So the motion for an inquiry was carried, and a conmmittee of five appointed to conduct it, with power to send for persons and papers, and with instructions to report the result to the House. That result will probably be nil, though the process, by drawing attention to a growing evil, will do good. The irregular agents and practitioners who form the Washington "Lobby" unless common report much belies them, are not in the habit of doing business so clunisily as to leave any legal evidence of their activity. There are a thousand modes of managing such transactions without compromising the principals. But it cannot be denied that out of doors there is a very general belief that members are extensively interes tedin certain kinds of bills, even if they do not exactly contaminate their fingers with base bribes. The inquiry may prevent a good deal of mischief in the present session, and cause some or most of the measures granting enormous quantities of public lands to be left over to the next session, the new House, and the incoming Administration. On the whole, the " Lobby" does not seem to have been particularly successful in its schemes this year. It is understood that the promoters of one great patent renewal bill have been obliged to abandon it as a hopeless case, though the proprietors of the patent could have spent $100,000 to push it through with profit. This shows at least that there is some check to the money power. The prospects of the Pacific Railroad Bills are also said to be precarious, though the lavish grants of public land they would authorize hold out a strong temptation to the adventurers in politics. This inquiry wiU probably "'kill" the Minnesota Land Bill by compelling a elo.e examination of its clauses. The " Lobby" has no doubt a great influence on the Legislature, but it is not yet all-powerful.
The rapid increase of this outside influence is not a thing to be surprised at; it is quite natural-in sonle degree inevitable, and in the course of time the irregular body itself will have to be both recognized and organized. Its action at present perplexes and alarms the public, as its fulldevelop. ment is comparatively of recent date. But it is one of the exerescences certain to gather round great national wealth. The astounding increase in the resources the Federal Legislature has under its control has increased the importance of every single vote in proportion to the amount of the fund. The value of a member of Congress, measured by his share of the function of expending the resources of the State, is now more than twice that of a member of the House of Comnuons. Deducting the interest lof our national debt, which is beyond the caprice or the economy of Parliament, the expenditure it has to vote annually does not much exceed in money that of the United States. The revenue of the Federal Government is in round numbers about 20,000,0001. sterling a-year, without the burden of a heavy national debt; it is almost
SU clearly at the disposal of Congress for public pur poses. Add to this the value of the public lands, the area of present territories and future States, which it may grant to sDeculators, to whom-as they may sell it-it has a positive money value, and it will be seen that the resources the Legislature of the American Republic can dispose of exceed those controlled by the E1nglish Parliament in time Of peace. The public bills now before Congress involving grants of land would, if passed, alienate from the State 133,000,000 of acres; in the hands of railroad companies they would be worth at least 200,000,000$, or about 50,000,0001. sterling. There is the ordinary expenditure to be voted, besides this mass of property, both together representing about 70,000,0001. sterling. Taldng both land and money as forming one fund of national wealth, it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that the Federal Congress at Washington has a disposing Power over twice the amount of national property slabject to the votes of the Parliament at Westminster. Aud in addition it should be observed, the American House of Representatives only contaias 230 members, and that both bran9hes of the
Legislature together number less than 300. Under such a state of things the importance o£ every vote is greatly increased; the money power rspresented by each member of Congress has expanded within the last 10 years to something the founders of the Republic never dreamed of. Of course, it renders the members liable to a severe pressure from without; the hordes of speculators this national wealth creates may be imagined; they come in all shapes and take many names, but their cry is continually the same, "IGive, give !" On every side the expenditure is increasing; the compatition for office and pay is not greater in any of the bureaucratic governed nations of Europe than in America, where it might be supposed the freer field for enterprise would draw men off from such a piursuit. The system of changing the functionaries according to the fluctuations of party increases the chances of employment and the eagerness for it, and the number of employe& grows with every addition of territory. The two directions in which the tendency to increased expenditure runs most decidedly at present are public works and the acquisition of a powerful navy. The formner are dispersed over the several States, and make no prominent or imposing show except in the magnificent constructions rising at Washington; but additions are annually being made to the navy of which Europe has occasionally the opportunity of judging. The army is comparatively neglected; it is smal in number, hardly sufficient to keep the peace on the frontiers, and its commissioned officers are so underpaid that the number of resignations among them begins to excite apprehension, for the educated staff of officers of the regular army is the only body from which efficient leaders of any volunteer or militia force could be at once drawn. Their pay will soon be brought up, like that of other departments of the public service, to the scale of the present day. In every direction, then, there is a pressure on the Treasury and the Legislature, that alone can authorize it to expend. That a comparatively small number of men, having under their control such immense amounts of money and money's worth, should be keenly canvassed for their votes on many measures that are not directly political, is not a matter of surprise. As the Congress is only elected for two years, a member scarcely begins to be acquainted with his duties and the forms of procedure when he quits his seat, and frequent re-election is not the rule; there are too many competitors for the place to allow a long possession. The bulk of the members, therefore, in every Congress come up inexperienced, and, it is scarcely uncharitable to suppose, incliRed to make the most of their tenure. On the other hand, the "Lobby" not being elected, is permanent ; many of their body are old ex-members, who tumn their acquired experience and the privilege of admission to the floor of the house, which is rather too loosely allowed them, to good account. They become "the guides, philosophers, and friends" of the new comers, whose votes are so valuable, and whose tenure is so slight that it is scarcely worth their while to make any mental exertion or moral sacrifice to retain it.j The actual work of the Legislature is done ir the committees, wlhch answer to the bureaux of continental assemblies. They shape the bills, and report them for acceptance, and, when business is driven up in a corner-as it always is at the end of a session-measures are frequently passed with the slightest possible knowledge of their provisions by the House at large. Under such circumstances the growth of the "Lobby," the permanent canvassing and managing body, is very natural. It is a creation of the national wealth, and a means of dispersing it; with an ebbing treasury it would disappear, and a reduction of the revenue, by remitting import duties, is actually contemplated to some degree as a measure of defence against its importunate perseverance. In the meantime it has one redeeming point,-it infuses a good deal of life into society at Washington.
The subject of the revision of the tariff will be brought on this week if the more exciting privilege question will permit. There are several projects before the House, and they all exhibit the feeling above intimated, that the Treasury is embarrassingly rich-that there is a plethora of revenue. There is the bill recommended by the majority of the Committee of WVays and Means, another proposed by the minority of that body, and two bils brought forward by individual members; they aU effect reductions in the present scale of duties, and none of them propose any increase. The bill of the majority of the Committee of Ways and Means will reduce the revenue by six milions of doUars immediately, and four milions more ultimately ; under it the duty on high and low priced wools will be entirely remitted. The bill of the minority of the committee makes a stiU larger inroad on the revenue, which it would reduce to about $45,000,000. It is objected to it that it retains some small duties, which would cost more than they produce to colect. No proposal has yet been made for reducing the duty on railroad iron, though it mightjustlybe considered as araw material. The arguments of the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Guthrie, in favour of the free importation of wvool apply with nearly as much force to iron. It is stated that any remission of the tariff, if made this sessioD, wil be founded less on national considerations than on the principles of political economy.
The alarm of the recent agitation among the slave population of several of the Southern States has not yet subsided; but the accounts, even of good authorities on the subject, are very contradictory. Some of the Southern papers make light of the whole affair, and say the rumours were absurdly exaggerated. others show plainly that there has been a terror excited, whether weU founded or not. The Committee of Safety appointed in Tennessee, where the most decided maovement appears to have taken place, have made a report, which, without stating anything in the way of evidence, decidedly recommends a series of precautionary measures which are generaUy restrictive of the indulgences hitherto allowed the slaves. The whites are advised to suppress aU assemblages of the negroes under whatever pretence, at frolics, balls, benevolent societies, or public worship, where the preachers are black men. Masters are not to allow their slaves to hire carriages on any occasion, as the practice of driving about in buggies destroys the proper sense of their subordinate position. The
report also reproves the masters for the "gross folly" they committed during the late Presidential contest of alowing the negroes to attendpublic political meetings at which speakers of both parties discussed the delicate subject of slavery. The slaves at such meetings derived from the denunciations of Abolitionists the knowledge that there was some great movement going on in the North on their behalf, which, working on their ignorance, produced the movement that has been so promptly repressed. It appears very singular that, while prohibiting the circulation of all printed matter relating to abolition, which the slaves cannot read, the masters should not have seen the mischief of allowing the negroes to attend meetings where they could hear these arguments repeated, even though they were refuted. The negroes could believe their ears, at least, especially when the speeches had the authority of their masters. Freedom of speech is dangerous in such a state of things, even for the whites; and in the violent defence of their political power they have themselves endangered their property, which was not assailed. The report recommends several stringent measurea of police throughout the Sta&W
which will probably be adopted as long as the alarm continue The only effect of the movement has been to render the condition of the negro, for a time at least, worse than it was before. It is calcutlated that 40 slaves have been hanged during the
crisis.
A bill has been introduced in the Senate by Mr. Seward, authorizing the United StateW' Government to enter into a contract with the Submarine Telegraph Company for the transmission of its mossages across the Atlantic. The Secretary of State had previously communicated to the Senate the propositions of the company. The bill wiU empower the Federal Govermment to lend actual aid by the employment of its ships of war in laying down the cable; and authorize it to settle the conditions on which it is to have a joint use of the line when completed. The conditions are that the Government of Great Britain shaU at the same time enter into a similar contract with the company upon terms of equality with those stipulated by the United States; the tariff of charges for the use of the line is to be fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States and the Government of Great Britain or its agent; the United States' Federal authorities are to be secured the use of the telegraphic line for the period of 50 years on precisely the same terms that may be lixed for its use on the part of the English Government. The bil is referred to thePost-offices Committee of the Senate. Some misgivings have been expressed as to the advantage of the line to the United States in case of a war, as the termini of the line are on British territory; but Lieutenant Maury, the scientific adviser of the Government on this subject, has published a letter showing that no apprehensions as to a possible interruption of the working of the line should be made an obstacle to, laying it down. The two points selected are the best that could be chosen, and any line direct to New York or any point farther south on the American coast than the one chosen, would have toencounter greater difficulties, while nothing would be gained by it, as, in any case, the European terminus would always be out of the con. trol of the authorities on this side of the ocean.. Lieutenant Maury believes that, even in case of a war, neither Govermnent would venture to resort to such an act of barbarism as cutting the wire, but that the communication would be kept up, as during the recent war, the telegraphic line between St. Petersburg, Paris, and London was in constant operation notwithstanding the hostilities between Russia, France, and England. It is reported at Washington that an offer will shortly be made to Congressby parties prepared to lay down a telegraphic cable from the easterm coast of Maine to the coast of Ireland for the same sum demanded of the United States' Government by the present company, without requiring any assistance from the Govermnent of Great Britain.
There is another Washington rumour circulating, that the Library Committee of Congress intend to invite Horace Vernet to paint a battle-piece for the new portion of the Capitol. It is added, that M. Vernet may be expected in the United States ia the spring.
The manner in which the gift of the Resolute has been received in England has been all that could be desired on this side the Atlantic, and the Americans are much pleased with the attentions paid to the officers in charge of the vessel. The officers of the Retribution will no doubt have the same honourable reception when she arrives with the American equipage; they will be invited to Washington and receive the hospitality of the President and members of the Government. Some demonstration is proposed at New York, but the plan has not yet taken any definite shape. The city council proposes to vote $2,500 for the expenses of some public reception.
A petition was some time since presented to Congress from the inhabitants of Carson-valley, a portion of the territory of Utah, praying that the district be annexed to the State of California. The inhabitants of the valley-not a happy vaUey it would seenx -c0nplain of the manifold wrongs and oppressions perpetrated by the MIormons. The Committee on Territories has refused the prayer on the ground that California is too large already, and would be made more unwieldy by such an extension of its boundaries. It adds that the remedy required is of a different kind, and recommends the enactment of a law for preventing and punishing bigamy, which is the root of the evils. Polygamy has already been declared a violation of the law by the Federal Judge of the territory of Utah; the difficulty is to enforce the common law among the disciples and subjects of Brigham Young. But the indications of a colision between his self-constituted authority and that of the United States are increasing, and wiU rapidlyincrease with the growth of the " Gentile" population; there is every probability that Deseret will share the fate of Nauvoo.
By way of New Orleans intelligence has been received from Punta Arenas and Costa Rica to the, 3d of December. It is stated that Walker had been beaten and compelled to evacuate Granada, and. take refuge in the Island of Ometepe. The mode in which Walker dealt with the property of the Transit Company has created him powerful enemies here-among others the extensive steamboat proprietor, Mr. Vanderbilt. Costa Rica has obtained a loan of $500,000, and a war-steamer is fitting out here, which will probably recover for the company one end of the transit route; the aid it is understood the Costa-Ricans are now receiving from New York will be likely to overbalance the recruits that have recently left to join the army of Walker.
The weather has been rather severe for some days, but now shows signs of relenting. The harbour has been filled by the drift ice that comes down the Hiudson, and the ferryboats have had some difficulty in keeping up the communication regularly with the suburbs of the city, but they have never been totally cut off. There is good sleihing in the country, but in the city snow degenerates so quickly into mud it has only been attempted for a day or two, and then very imperfectly. As a compensation the ice has caked beautifuUy on the side walks, where it is polished into extra smoothness by the feet of passengers, and Young New York gleefully seizes the pavements for skating ground.

THE BULLION ROBBERY.-Yesterday morning, at
THE BumLON ROBBRY.-Yesterday morning, at 10 o'clock, was appointed by Mr. Baron Martin for the further hearing of the parties claiming to be entitled to the Turkish Bonds aud other securities that were found in the possession of Pierce, one of the prisoners convicted of the bullion robbery. It will be remnembered that the learned judge, at the conclusion of the trial of the three prisoners,
?ierce, Burgess, and Tester, expressed an opinion that these securities ought to be given to Fanny Kay for the benefit of herself and the child of Agar, but, although an application was made to him for an order to that effect, he declined to make such an order, and it appears very doubtful whether he has the power to do so. Smce then the Sheriffs of London and Middlesex have claimed the property, as being found in the possession of a felon, on behalf of the Crown, and a host of other claimants have also put forward what they conceive to be their rights in reference to the propertr in question, and a unumber of afidavits has been laid before the learned judge setting forth the grounds upon which their claims are founded. The matter was partly entered into last Wednesday, wben Mr. Baron Martinadjournedthe inquiry until yesterday in his private room in the Court of Exchequer, and at the appointed hour several of the parties were in attendance, but, after waiting for some time, an intimation was given tbat the learned judge bad not had sufficient time to consider the matter, and that all tha parties must be again at the court on the following day, when he would give his decision, and the lnatter aceordingly stands over to this day; but the general impression appears to be that the learned judge will decline to make any order in reference to the property, but will leave all the claimants to their legal remedy. It is said, upon good iuthority, that it is the intention of the Government to grant Agr, the approver, a pardon, upon the condition that he shal leave this country, and it wi be void if ha returns to-England. This proseiding it is understood, is not taken on account of his hab given ovsdence to convict his companions inl the bulliosiTrobberJ; but it is owing .to *. behief, from inquiries that have been made, and a. variety of facts which have come to the knowledge of th authorities, that be really was not guilty ot the forgery 5oe which he wvas convicted anda entenced to transportation Ios life, and that the traneation was a "P3ant" uequ hbe tb purpose of getting himn gut of tW Val

rA portion of the following appeared in our second edition of Yesterday:-1
PARS, SuNDAY, JA. 25, 6 P.X.
The Persian Ambassador, so long expected and so much talked about in political circles, has at last presented his credentials, and this magnificent personage has taken his station among the fimed stars of our diplomacy. He promises to be the admired of all admirers, and to completely efface the traces left in our memories by the majestic proportions of Count Orloff and the brillianey of his diamoncs. In personal advantages Feruk Ehan may fairl bear a comparison with the other foreign diplomatists. He appears to be a man about 40 years of age, or a little more. He wears a beard, black and rich, such as few diplomatic chins could grow,and which excites the envy and despair of the uniledged atacs of the older missions, who gaze on him with admiration. His eyes are black and piercing, and his figure gracefuL Among those who accompany him are said to be two cousins of the Sovereign of Persia; and they wear a white scarf over their rich uniforms, no doubt as a sign of their being " born in the purple chamber." The Ambassador was, doubtless, ignorant of the simple grandeur of the Imperial Court, and the indifference for show and splendour which characterizes our courtiers, otherwise he would not have come laden, as he is said to be, with many and rich gifts. He has brought,it seems,a whole cargoof Cashmere shawls and other such articles for presents, so that among an influential portion of the Parisian population his beaaz yetz are not the only charms which will insure him a welcome. Among his attaches are one or two literary gentlemen. It would be curious to hear their opinions of men and things in this capital of European civilization, and we, may yet be gratified with another series of "Persian letters," surpassing in interest the genuine correspondence which bears the name of Montesquieu. We have an Tlsbeck and a Ricon on the spot, and they must have left many a Roustan and an Ibben in Teheran, to whom they can confide their thoug,hts.
The Montiteqn- has the followring:
"HEis Excellenoy Feruk K;han, Ambassador from Persia, received a public audience yesterday from the Emperor, in the Throne-room at the Tnileries, and presented the letters aowediting him to His Imperial Majesty. His Excellency vas received at the same time by the Empress
"Their Majesties were attended by the great officers of the Crown, the Grand Mistress of the Empress's Household, the Lady of Honour of Her Majesty, and the Ladies of the Palace.
"The Minister for Foreign Aif;irs Attended at the audience.
" His Excellency the Persian Ambassador addressed the following speech to the Emperor:-
"'Sire,-The friendly relations which so long existed between France and Persia having been again consolidated by a recent circumstance, I have been chaiged by the verypowerfulShah-in-Shah of Iran, myaugust Sovereign and benefactor, to bear to your Imperial Majesty the compli. ments and congratulations of my Sovereign.
" ' It is a happiness for me that my mission has occurred at a period when France is loaded with so many blessings Irom Heaven-first, the glorious accession of your Imperial family to the throne of France; next, Sire, the birth of his Imperial Highness, the heir of your crown-an event which is a guarantee for the duration of your Majesty's dynasty, and a subject of joy for all Frenchmen and for al the friends of France; next, the conclusion of peace between the powerful alies and Russia in this same capital of France. In fine, Sire, I come to France after the conclusion of a treaty between Persia and the powerful empire of France-a fact which had ever been the object of the hopes and wishes of the two States, an object to which the efforts of the Governors and the Sovereigns of the tvo States tended, and which is now accomplished, 'With the assistance of God, conformably to the intimate desire of the august Sovereigns of France and Iran.'
" To the speech of the Ambassador the Emperor made the following reply:-
"'Monsieur l'Ambassadear,-I am happy that your Sovereign has charged you to bring me his congratulations. When the war broke out in the East I sought with pleasure to renew our former relations with Persia, and her neutrality was not useless to us. I nowc ongratulate myself upon the treaty of commerce concluded between our two countries, as commercial relations firmly established always cement the friendship of nations.
II ' It is with regret that I heard of the war which has broken out between you and ono of my most intimate allies, but I entertain the most ardent wishes that your mission to this portion of the glohe may hasten the return of a lasting peace.
I" I thank yoa for the flattering things you have said to me of France and the Prince Imperial, and I beg you to believe in my fuU sentimenta of good will towards you.'
*- Feruk Khan, after having presented to their Majesties the persons attached to his suite, handed to the Ecaperor, in the name and on the part of his Sovereign, the Royal Ordesf Persia and presents for the Empress and the Imperial Prilice.
"' His Excellency the Persian Ambassador and his attendants were conveyed to the Palace of the Tuileries in Court carriages and re-conveyed after the audience to the hotel of the Persian Embassy with the same ceremony."
The Gonstitbuti,-ynnl announces that General Count de Paar, who commands the Austrian troops in Moldavia, has made known to the troops under his command, by an order of the day dated Jassy, the measures adopted by his Government for the evacuation of the Principalities.
Ihe necessary preparations were commenced on the 12th January for transporting the hospitals and military stores into the Buckovina.
The evacuation of Greece by the French troops is said to be decided upon. It will probably take place in the spring.
It is stated that at the instance of his advocate, M. ?logent St. Laurens, a medical commission will be named with a view to ascertain the grounds on which Verger is supposed to have been insane when he assassinated the Archbishop of Paris.

The following is from the DDebats:
"The Powers which signed the protocol of London are doubtless of the same opinion on the real merits of the Nene chfltel question. There may exist certain difliculties of ninor Importance, which wlll be removed either by diplomacy before the meeting of the Conference, or by that very Con-
fertnce. SOMe jounal have alluded to certain of these difficulties. Prussia desires, it is said, to ace her flag hoisted

1Bcc itst'Urn Crispn I IA Veron de~t for the departent of the Seiuse, em etrn that it sall nt be Isis fault ifliisorteny the public. 'He has just pubihe olm i 0
pages, entitled Quathe Ans de RMgne; oio en sommes I nous? It is partly historical, and partly literary, but it is doing no injustice to the writer to presume that it is a feeler thrown out with a view to the approaching elections. If the electors are ungrateful or stupid enough not to appreciate the merits of such a man, and refuse to return him to the new Chamber, they are to be pitied,-so much the worse f or them. M. Veron has done his duty in proving his own consummate fitness for legislation and in recording his own incomparable merits. It is now a question among his friends whether, in cae of failure as a candidate to represent his fellow " bourgeois de Paris," he will still persevere, or will retireto the desert, and spend the remainder of his existence in weeping over the folly and shortsightedness of his generation. I doubt this latter conclusion. He is not a man to conceal his light under a bushel. He has already occupied too large a space in the political world of Paris to give up the contest so soon. The "Pdte PectoraZ de Renault," the French opera, the Constitutioniel, the Chiarivari, to the wit of which he so long ministered, the Memoires d'un Bourgeois de Paris, the Cinq (lent miUe Francs de Rente, and his present publication, have acquired for him so much notoriety that he cannot, while yet in the full blow of his fame, withdraw himself from notice and descend to private life, like a sinple mortal. lo artist willingly abandons a stage where he has been for years accustomed to inhale the intoxicating fumes of applause. MI. Veron's appetite for renown of some kind or other is so intense that his intimate friends declare he wquld, rather than not attract public curiosity, take his stand for any given time on the Column of the Place Vend6me, or take the place of the winged Fame that stretches its limbs to the clouds from the sumnmit of the Pillar of July.
The Quatre Asm de RBgne, though limited in size, is encyclopiedic in its subject. It touches on a variety of topics-the marriage of the Emperor, the Universal Exhibition, the army of the Crimea, the Paris Congress, the birth of the Imperial Prince, the high price of bread, and, by an easy transition, the war in the East, the social and political statistics of the Senators, ditto of the Deputies, opinions of M. Thiers, the labours of the Legislative Corps, the Government projets de lois, the " orators" of the Chambers, the Salle des Conferences, the Council of State, with a particular ;ulogy on M. Baroche, the President of that independent and disinterested body, the Institute, the newspapers, and the laws and decrees which affect the press, &c., all these matters M. Veron handles with a freedom of touch which betrays the practised artist, and the decision of a man who has no doubt whatever of the rectitude of his judgment. M. Veron has nothinw but eulogy, sometimes a little excessive, for th-e Emperor; but, if he was not known to be merely a jovial and harmless personage, his colleagues of the, legislative corps might feel hurt at some of his remarks on them. He approves the present system of government, but thinks the " windows of the Legislative Chamber" might be opened with advantage-meaning, either that more freedom should be given to the debates, or that the public should not continue to lose the benefit of his own peculiar oratory. This, however, is one of the few points in which those who regret the restrictions which still k-eep down freedom in this countrv will agree with him, and it is onlya pitythat some more serious personage than M. Veron is not its advocate. M.Veron's book has one merit which it would not be fair to pass over in silence. It contains a list, arranged in alphabetical order, of the Senators, Deputies, Council of State, and the household of the Emperor, and a short summary of the laws that have been voted, and of the reports which have been presented on themthe whole accompanied with expressions of praise which will not fail to be gratifying to the reporters. It is a pity he has not added the addresses of the gentlemen who compose these bodies; the Qutatre 2Ss de R+gsce might then be advantageously consulted as a political directory.

The draught of the firman for the convocation of the Moldavian and Wallachian divans ad hoc was completed on Tuesday, the 13th inst. The internal independence of the two principalities is guaranteed. According to a report received from the Circassian coast, Sefer Pasha has defeated the Russians. Accounts of victories obtained by the inhabitants of the Caucasus over the Russians must be received with extreme reserve, but a person who must be tolerably weeU informed of what is passing on the east coast of the Black Sea yesterday acknowledgeed that since the spring of 185 the Russians had obtained no advantage " worth mentioning" over the mountaineers. If I rightly understood my informant, such great changes are being made in the Russian military system that no operations on a large scale will at present be undertaken against the inhabitants of the Caucasus. Positive information has reached me that the Ruvssians are just now extremely busy "on both sides" of the Caspian, and that very many transports have been built within the last few months.
It is not known here why their Majesties have resolved on shortening their stay at Milan. The tbree Ministers, Count Buol and Barons Bach and Bruck, will probably be back in Vienna in a few days. It is credibly stated that the Archduke Perdinand Max has already been appointed GovernorGeneral of the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom. General Count Gyulai will take the command of the second army, and have his head-quarters at Verona. General Count Degenfeldt is to be Military Commander of Milan.
It is to be expected that the European Commission, now assembled at Galatz, will soon communicate to the different Governments the results of its labours. The Austrian representative is said to have laid before his colleagues somo plans and reports, the result of observations made during a long series of years. The reports contain very valuable information respecting the three mouths of the Danube. The Austrian Commisary gives the preference to the Kilia mouth of the river, as it is more protected from the wind, and consequently less filled with sand than the others. The representatives of the other Powers are said to incline to the St. George's or most southerly mouth of the Danube. The fall in the Kilia arm is from 8 to 10 inches in 1,000 feet, and the rapidity of the current 10 feet in a second. When the water is at the lowest point the depth of the Kilia arm is, on an average, 10 feet.
No further news has been received from Trieste repcting the Asia, which went down on the Albanian coat during the night of the 12th.

BE}LIN, SAN. 24.
L telegraphic extract from an article in the Afoifer o yetedaytels ts tutthe Paris offlidl Journal speaks of the intentions of the King of Prussia as being conciliatory, and that he has given
notice of his willingness to enter into negotiations about the Neuchatel sovereignty; and this is, I believe, the sum total that anybody here can report to you, if he confines himself to what is positive and actual. In the announcement that Prussia lately made of her willingness to treat about the cession of the sovereignty there was no proposal made as to how, when, or where these negotiations shall be commenced and carried on. The initiative iv thewe points is left to the four great Powers who, in 1852, undertookto bring the matter to a settlement, on the condition that Prussia should in the meantine refrain from military measures. The present situation, now that the prisoners are released, is nearly the same as then. The great Powers have still the oblgation to use due diligence in settling the matter, and Prussia reserves to herself the right, as long as it remains unsettled, to choose her own opportunity and means of vindicating the King's claims. As Switzerland is the Power most interested in bringing the matter to an issue, it is most probable that she wiU lose but little time in moving the European Powers to constitute their Areopaggs, and allow the matter to come on for hearing. Before this result can be attained, however, there are two preliminary questions to be settled by the five Power among themselves-first, where the conferences shal be held; and, secondly, whether a representative of Switzerland shall be admitted to them. As regards the first, London Iseems to be the most likely place for a nuamber of reasons already mentioned in former letters. The second question of the presence lof a Swiss repre. sentative at the conferences will, doubtles, be lecided in the affirmative, at any rate at the concluding sittings, if not altogether. If the arrange. ment is to be of the nature of a mutual agreeme'nt andtreaty, of course Switzerland must be a party to all the debates; if, on the contrary, the settlement is to be an award made by the great Powers in the Neuchatel matter, Switzerland would only have to be called in at the last to be informed what the umpires have decided. As regards this second point, of the admission of a representative of Switzerland to the conferences, I am assured that no objections wiMl be made to it here. There is also another affair to be settled simultaneously, though not as an indispensable preliminary to the opening of the conferences,-viz., the resumption of diplomatic relations between Prussia and Switzerland. This, in all probability, the French Government will shortly bring about; it is the representative of France in Bmrne who at present takes cognizance of Prussian interests in Switzerland in the absence of the Prussian Leation there. It is evident, therefore, that some e time must necessarily elapse before the conferences can commence, during which period the five great Powers, assmming that Switzerland has once got them to move in the matter, wi correspond with each other forthepurpose of settlng the prelimiaries. For 'the present, therefore, while this preliminary diplomatic correspondence is going on, we can afford to take leave of the matter.
As regards the conditions the King will stipulate for as the consideration for ceding his sovereignty, whenever the conferences do come together, I will venture to affirm that there is nobody here who can state at all what they will be, inasmuch as no decision has as yet been arrived at on the subject, and the views of those entitled to speak on the occasion are very various. What I sitated in my last letter as to the stipulations for indemnity for the revenue sacrificed and for judicial security of the Conservative party against oppression in NeuchMtel when the sovereiggnty is given up are, as it appears, only 'Alinisterial notions; the idea of pecuniary indemnity, I am assured, has not only not proceeded from the King, but has not even been mentioned before him, from the certainty that, far from being acceptable, it would only provoke disgust; and certainly, when looked at more closely, it would be rather a sordid affair to take an indemnity for the loss of a property which never brought anything in, the Neuchttel revenues having notoriously always been spent in the principality. All that has been sa:d about the private property of the King being retained there is very indistinct; the Swiss Federal Coancil has denied officially that he is possessed of any there, and I have never heard as yet that he ever possessed anything more than a revenue secured upon certain State domains; but this by no means excludes thepossibility thata more intimate acquaintancewith the details of His Majesty's private fortune might teach me better. There are notwanting very influential and highly respected voices at Court to advocate the total and entire cession of every particle of property, title, and claim of every sort in Neuchatel, with little more than a nominal indemnification, if any; and certainly this course, which would admit of being painted and decorated in diplomatic phrase as an act of kingly magnanimity and generosity, is at the same time the wisest, for no one who is acquainted with the spirit pervading the Radical faction in the Republic of Switzerland will deny the almost certainty that as long as the King has any status there at all, whether as private proprietor, or as patron of charitable institutions, or as protector of any party or political tendency in the canton, he would be constantly exposed to insults and annoyances, which would only embroil him with Switzerland and the rest of Europe if he resented them, and which there can* be no corresponding advantages to induce him to put up with quietly. It is to be hoped that this more elevated and enlightened view will eventually be adopted, and, vexatious as the affair has been in its early stages, the King wil then have had the satisfaction of getting his right acknowledged by all Europe, and of acting an apparently magnanimous part for the improvement of the chances of peace in future.
The only solitary passenger who perished with the crew of the Violet in the early part of this month, on the passage from Ostend to Dover, is ascertained to have been a Herr von Ising, captain in the 15th Regiment of Prussian Infantry. He left Minden, where he was stationed with his regiment, on the 4th inst., for the purpose of visiting London on family business, taking letters of introduction and bills of exchange with him; as the letters were not heard of as being delivered, nor the biUs of exchange presented, and his leave of absence had expired without his wife and friends hearing anything from him, his portrait was forwarded to Ostend and there recognized as that of the only one landsman who would not be deterred from crossing to Dover by the terrors of the storm. The agonies of suspense which his wife has been enduring for many weeks past were thus remaoved only to make way for the crushing certainty of bereavement. The wife, thus suddenly made a widow, is a sister of the Fraullein CruweU, who, as the much admaired Signorina CruveUi, has for some years been known to most of your readers.

A letter from Neuchatel of the 20th inst. gives some details relativetotheliberation of thel41Royalist prisoners. On the 16th the decision of the Federal Chambers was announced to them, and the articles of the Penal Code were read to them, which punishes persons returning to the country after expulsion, and they promised that they would not return until after the conclusion of an arrangement between the King of Prussia and the Swiss Confederation. At midnight of the Uth three carriages, previously prepared by the postmaster, were in waiting to receive them not far from the prison. They were conveyed
with greatspeedtoVerrires, and theuceto Pontarher, where they arrived without accident at 5 in the morning of the 18th, with passports suppliedby the authorities. The other prisoners, to the number of 42, who had been liberated on bail, have been allowed a few days to prepare for their departure. Ev4ry precaution had been adopted to disappoint public curiosity, and great crowds were assembled at the port of Neuchatel on the mornin' of the 18th expecting to see theprisoners leaveby the lake. The prisoners speak in high terms of Major Perret for his care and attention dulring their journey to the frontier. M. de Pourtales-Saladin, brother of M. de Pourtales-Steiger, chief-of the insurrection, but to whose politica views he is opposed, has subscribedl,OO0 francs for the support of the families of the less wealthy soldiers who have been called out to serve in defence of their country.

LIVERPOOL, Jm. 26.
The steamer Prince Arthur, J. X'Gowan, brings dates of the 17th inst. from Lisbon, 'where she had put into the previous day for coals on her way from Alexandria to this port. The steamer Ignez de Castro had arrived on the 16th from Glasgow ; and from Malta Her Majesty's ship Prin. cess Royal, Captain G. Giffard, which bad grounded as she was anchoring, but got off with the evening flow tide. TEis vessel, with the French steamer Ph6nix, anchored at iAsbon, and the ship Austerlit4 in Passo d'Arcos Bay, were the only foreign vessels of war in the Tagus.
Rear-Admiral Sir R. C. Dndas's squadron had left on the 16th for a fortnight's cruise.
Further advices received at Lisbon stated that the steamer Queen, Captain D. Mecklereid, bound from Lisbon for London, which ran ashore on the 12th near Viana, was a total wreck, and was to be sold on the 24th inst. The crew, spece, and greater part of the cargo had been landed, and hopes were entertained of saving the rest.
On the 16th the English bark Sir Charles Napier, Captain W. Balsellie, from Leith to Trinidad, had put in for repairs.
On the 16th the French war steamer Flambeau, from 9oree-and Madeira to Brest, put in for coals; and a Bremenese bark, from Bremen to New York, with emigrants, leaky.
Our Lisbon correspondent does not report by this steamer any political news of importanee. The House of Deputies was stl engaged in preliminary proceedings; and, though many of the elections had been held valid, it was probable that the electoral process for Beija, under debate when our correspondent closed his letter, would bo annulled.

Ieamington was nominally at 100 to 7, but no transaction about him came under our notice. Schiedam wasin good demand. In the city during the morning he had been hacked for some money' early in the afternoon 40 to 1 was laid; but at the close oi business he was advanced to 1,000 to 30.
Two THousA2'D.-Schiedam was in request for this event also, and was made first favourite. At first 600 to 100 was taken about him, but ultimately a good sum was invested in his favour at 5 to L 600 to 100 each against Schiedam and Vedette was laid in one bet. 11 to 2 was wanted about Loyola. 750 to 100 was the last bet booked about Sydney.

"The deed of settlement of the bank oontemplates one ordtnary General Mfeeting annuaUy, which the Proprietors have already determi,ed shall be held after the lose of the financial period ending on the 3eth of June in each Year but your directors, oonsidering recent dir umstances, have thought it desirable to call the Proprietors together o n the present occasion ot the declaration of a dividend, beloving that opportunitiesfor intercoursebetweendirector sand shareholders hould be encouraged as conducive to mutual confidenoe.
' Toe account of liablihties and assets, as vourhod by the auditors, showvs a balance standing to credit of I profit and loss' ou the 31st of December last of £X15904 9s. lid., after payment of the sum ot Le0,233 12s. to customers for interest on their balanoes. The directors, having fully considered the provision to be made for bad and doubtful debts and other contingencies, have decided to declare a difidend for the half-year at the rate ef £5 per cont. perannum (free of income-tax). reserving a complete settlement of profit and loss unti after the 30th of Juue next, as origtULly detenninea.
I It -ill be seen that the profits for the past half-year have not been proportionate to the business aciuired, and it should be stated in explaiation, that during that period the diroctors, as adrninistering the alfairs of a bank so recenty establishod, have felt it their duty to maka Facrifices tosecurity at the expenseof temporary profit, by keeping in hanid ample available fends, sud by the reaUzation of securities at a deprecistion, acting under the conviction that during a period of monetary pressure and general mistrust they by such a course best consulted the interests of the proprietors, and iaid the surest basis for future pro.perity.
" Notwithstanding the operation of exoeptounal circumstances upon immediate profit, the bank has, sines the data of tbe last report, adva-ced steaslly ana withoutinterminlosin the acqsalsition of business. Current accounts, in particular, which we the chief source ot profit have increased 33 per cent. in number and 29 per cent. in amount of balances; and the directors are fully justified in asserting that the pr,erees of tio undertaking has been substantial, and that it prospects are highly satisfactory.
" The buiiding expenses have been sUghtly augmented by the purchase of the lease and adaptation of the premises adjoining the Charing-cross Branch, a step rendered necessary by the rapidly increasuig business of tihe establishment. On the other hand, the diro.tors have the eatisfa¢tion to report that they have made arrangementstwith respect to that portion of the premises in the city not required for busines purposes, upon advantageous terms.
The bankc was admitted to the facilities of the Clearing-house on the lht of October last.
' Your directors again acknowvledge with satisfaction the support they have received from the shareholders in the introduction of hurtness, and they rely with confidence on their continued co-operationx to mnaintain and imProve the imprortant position which the bank nowt oocupies.

CARTER V. CROPLRY.
This appwea wasa rgedbefore this Court on thelv3h inst., and was at that time fully reported in t,pe almes, as the case had been when it w previously bef ore Vice-Chatnellor Kinderiley. The shortn anuetion, it wil be recoleid t as whether by the words "uties powersand privileges"lmentioned in the acts of Parliament 18th and 19th of Victoria, cap. 12, and the 19th and 20thi of Victoria, cap. 112, respectavely i issed for the "better Iocal roanagement of the metropolis" and for the "amen dment" of the former act, the right to elect a perpetual curate had become vested inthe vestry of the parish, and, consequently, whether that curate, so elcted, could be properly presented to the bishop. The Vice-Chanoellor had decided in the affirmative, and dismised the plaintifo biU with costs. Messrs. Carter and Dudley, who had filed the bill oha behlf of themselves and all tho other parishioners ant inthbitants of St. James's Clerkenwell, dissatisfied with that jt(dgmnent, appealed, their counse insisting that, by the deed of 1656, the presentation waspanrightoofapriathe properti oestedrin trustees for the
beneft wofl taht thewod" parishioners and inhabitat,adddntps bythe wors,eadnerwa intend ded byatn the Legislaiturei
Hri.TEckRELL and Lr. SETld E supported the plainti i (the APpelats') case.
&Mr.HRDY (who was counsel with Mr. Baily) argued, for the defendants, that the judgment of the Vice-Chsncelor was correct.
Their Lordships, after the close of the argumett deferred their decision, and the case stood in the paper of thai morn9Zr Justice IKN,IGHT BRtUCE sald that it was unnecessary to sy, nor, indeed, was he snre, what the inclination ok hig opinion would have been as to the validity or invaldity of the trust created by the deed of 165, en which the anestion depended, or as to the meaning or constraction whach the Coturt would attach to the words "parishioners And inhabitans used in the deed creatinig the trust, it being imps Ible at this date, after A lapse of 200 years, Ant
a8te the 1 decisions of such eminent judges as Lord Hardwicke and Lord Eldon, to treat the trust as not valid or to depart from their unitd authority. The question how far beth or either of the statues referred to i the argnumentaffectedth vassewasvery difer rint. The Vice-Chancellor disposed of the case on an interlecutory ap picti only-it was before this Court onn the hearing as wsrtetl; a
after giving the best consderation to the reasons of that excellent and Able jodge in his judgment, and after a careful attention to it and to the arguments of the leared counse, and looking with the greatest car at the two statutes altogether, and oreo particularly the 1nt, 2d, 6th, 8th, 90th, 91st, 92d, ind 140th sections of the earlier statute, and the 3d and lastsmetions of the later one, his Lordship felt himself under the necessity of acknowlodging that he was not satisfied that the title to the equitable advowson was afrected in derogation of the rsght of the vilaintiffs, on whom the -burden of proof did not lie, the burdea being on those who asserted the title in the vestry to show, if they could, that the Legislature had done that which they charged it with doing. Judging of the intent of the Leature from the contents of the acto its pearedto his Lordship that neither was intended to htae (re-nor did they or either of them interfere-with rights such as those which the plaintifu, since the decisions of Lords Hardlwicke and Eldon, mnust be taken to have had, and (on the assumption of the immateriality of the two cts) must be taken to have still. His Lordship had carefuay consideredt the several sections referred to, and though not perhaps satisfied that the letter of the aot
was not with the plaintiffs,yet he was certainly satisfied that their spicitwas notagainstthem,andhad notmade anychange in the rightin question. Neither statute persuaeaium that, whatever might have been desired or proposed out of Parliament, the destruction of such a title as the present was intended within the walls of Parlament.het was, however, msfficient to say that if any such intention did exist it ought to ha-ve beenx clearly expressed. There was roomn for reasonable doubt, and, as a doubt existed, those who would have been entitled exept for the intervention of the Legislature must have the benefit of that doubt. Perhaps in te absenc oftans Authori( on the subject his Lordshipse cinion might lavebee ordismpsg the bll, either on

Lord Justice TU-oi\ER said that the case came before the Court raising a question whether the trustees of a dead, dated in 1Ia, had the right of presentation to the perpetual curacy of the parish of St. James, Clerkenwell The plaintiffs sued on behalf of themselves and all other the inhabitants and parishioners, and they said that the trustees of the deed were beund to present such person as they, the plaintiffs, should elect, and not such person as should be elected by the vestry. Upon the facts of the case the Corth must assme the correctness of the dfecion of the Court of Exchequer in 1769, by which it was held that the rxight of election was veded in such as paid "tithes and rates and asessments to twhechurch and poor ;I andthe question was whether that right so vested had been interfered with by the acts of Parliamert passed for the better local govern. ment of the metropolse-whether the inhabitants and
parshoners had lost their right which had by those acts =en traoerred to the vestry n other words," whether a right of prolerty (given by the deed of 1656 to the inhabitants and parishioners) had been taken away, and whether, upon a fair view of the whole of those acts, the Legislature intend a that they should have that effect? What was the purpose of the first act was explained by the recital, which spon e of ianagement as connected with the words "paving, lighting," and so on, so that the act coldd not have been inte,nde to have any such effect as that which was contended for by the defendants, and of that his Lordship was quite satisfied. The 90th section of the first act had been very much referred to, and it was important to consider that section with a view to the Amcendment Act, That section had two branches, one relating to "duties, wers, and authorities" relating to paving, lighting, and so forth, and the second relating to o Tduties, powers, and authorities" relating to the regulation, government, or concerns of the parish. With regard to the first branch, it was plain that the act did not affect the title in question. What was meant in thepseond branch byl regulation and govenment" it was easy to understand; butastoconcerns," thatwasmortedifficulttobe apprehended, although it must, his Lordship supposed, be held to refer to the business conceems of the pariah. In that it -was impossible reasonably to include tho duty orpower of presenting a clerk to the curacy ; and he was of opinion, therefore, that the words of the first act could not be held to include any such rgt That being so, in his L-ordship's opinion the case ofth defendants must rest upon the Amendment Act the 12th section of which enactea is na the two should betonxitred togetser as one act. The first section was not very intelligble, although it was to be collectedl that it related to church-rates, and as such it was to he inxferred that it was not intended to refer to the presenLtation, If it had, the presentation would have been mentioned. Then it was necessary to refer to the third setion, which had been relied upon. There the words "duties, powers3, and privileges?' occurred as they did in the former act - and, as the L-egislature had said the two acts were to be constred toehras one act, and as the 90th section of the frtatclearly did not apply to the presentation, it followed that the words "1duties, powers, and privileges" in the second act were "duties, powers, and privileges" cju-sdiem gesesris with those in the 90th secion, and therefore not inclusive of the presentation. Then, with egard to the words, "including sach as relate to the affairs
Lof the church," mentioned in the parenthesis in the 3d. sec-
tion, it was clear they must be interPreted with the
same qualification as appliod to the simlar words in the 90th section, and could not be held to apply to the right of presentation vested in the inhabitants and parishioners, Upon the vacancy the trustees of the deed of 1656 were bound to present a clerk elected by tho inhabitants and
prishionerg, and apresentation by them of a clerk electod
by the vestry would have been a violstion of their duty. Although his Lordship always mistrusted his own opinion
when opposed to that of Vice-Chancellor Eindersley, he felt bound to hold that his deision could not stand, and that the election of the Rev. Mr. Maguire was void, and that the dnty of the Court was to grant a perpetual injunction against his presentation, and to direct that aUl the costs, both hero
and before the Vioe-Chancellor, should be paid by the defendants, the vestry. -

land to reverse an order of Mlaster Tinney, datedin XMy last, peremptorily ordering Mr. Ilaitland to pay to the official manager of the above company the sum of 18,298L, alleged to be due from Mr. MAitland under the further charge fled against him in February, 1r, by the offioial manager. Mr. Maitland was one of the manaing committee of the company, and signed checkstotheamount before named for the purpose, as alleged by him, of defraying the surveying, engineering, and other expenses of the comnpany. Mr. kaitland, on the one hand, said that the Master refused to allow him to discharge himself from the amount charged against him by the official manager, but the official manager, on the other hand, said that Mr Maitland declined to go into his dischargo before the Master. It was, however, admitted on behalf of the offlicial manager that Mr. Maitland had been charged with a larger amount than he was bound to pay.
Air. Wigram and Mr. EAsch appeared for Mr. Maitland and Mr. Malins and Mr. Hetherington for the official manager.
The VICZ-CLNACELLOR discharged Master Tinney's order of May last, and ordered that the Master should inquire and state to the Court whether any and what of the sum of 18,2981. was due fromn Mr. Maitland alone, or jointly and Eeverally with other persons, and ought to be paid to the official manager.
THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL V. THO2PSOX.
Mr. TERRELL applied for an order directing the payment out of the funds recovered from the defendants in the above cause of the costs of the Attorney-General in a suit instituted by him against the same defendants before the present information was fied. In 1846 the Attorney-General. acting on the certificate of the Charity Commissioners, filed an information against Mr. Alderman Thompson and others, who were the lessees of a eoal mine belonging to a charity, for the yurpose of obtaining an account of the wrorkein of the mninec, and for payment of what might be found ue to the charity from the lessees. That information was tWiCe amended, and the defendants put in answers to the original and amended informations. The Attorney-General wished to amend the information a third time, but tho timo for doing so had esoired, nd the defendants also objected to his doing it. FinMing th q ;it would be impossible to proceed with the information lits then state, and that its object would he defeatd the Attorney-General applied for and obtained an order for its dismissal. The present informa. tion was then fied, inl which documents produced in the course of the proceedings in the former sort were made use of. Ultimately the second suit was settled, the defend. ants, the lessees, submitting to pay their own costs, and to pay into court, for the benefit of the charity, 2,5001., out of whic, however, the costs of the trustees of the charity and
made for the costs of theeAtettorney-G^enera Nin tvheformers Spayment ithereof out of the susm otf Zp,5001 recoeredinth
Mr. COLLINS, on behalf of the trustees, resisted the application.
The VICE-CHANCELLOR said, It was admitted that the original suit could by amendment have been put into such a shape as would have insured muocess. The charity also had ha the benefit of the information derived in the progress of the first sult. It would be against every principle, therefore, to refuse this application.
(Before VitC-Chancelor Sir W. P. WOOD.)
REZD V. BARTON.
Mr. W. H. TERXELL moved to take the answer of the defendant in this case off the file, as being evasive and delusive. The suit was a common redemption suit, the biU setting out a lease which was the common title of the plain. tiff and defendant, the mortgage to the defendant, a tender of themortgage money withinterest, and arefusal of itby the defendants. The time for answering having expired on the 17th of September last, an application for time was made and one month granted. On the 17th of October and on the Ist and 14th of November applications were again made for further time, which on each occasion was granted, with the consent of the plaintiff, to the extent of a fortnight. On the 29th of November, upon a summons which had been taken out, five days' further time was granted, and on the 5th of December the defendant's solicitor wrote asking for further time, saying that, if not consented to, he must take out a summons, and if not granted he should be obliged to put in a mere formal answer, to which exceptions would have to be taken. On the 13th of December another summons for further time was taken out, returnable on the 18th, and on the 19th the plaintiff wrote insisting on the Answer being filed within one week. On the 26th the defendant's solicitor wrote saying he had filed the answer. This was the answer which it was now sought to take off the file. It purported to be merely an auswer to the first interrogatory, which was whether or not the lease mentioned in the bill was not of the date and to the purport, &c., mentioned in the bill. On the 27th of Decenber the defendant's solicitor wrote to the plaintiff's solicitor, to the effectthat he was mostunwiUing to file the answers, as that would complicate the title and make the case more difflcult to arrange. On the 31st of December the plaintiff's solicitor wrote, askingtoseethedraughtanswers whicb it was proposed to file, but this was not acceded to. It vas contended for the plaintiff that the facts would have warranted a motion to commit the defendant in contempt, but that course had not been adopted, the only object being to et a propr answer. The cases of " Lynch v. Lecesne" (1 flare) au " Brooks v. Purton" (1 Younge and Colyer's NcIo Ciancery CCscs) were relied on.
Mr. WILLIAMI MORRIS, for the defendant, did not contend that the answer was sufficient, but the proper course was to except, and the real question was whether the old and regular practice was to be abandoned, and the sufriciency or insufficency of the answer in every case be tested bv a motion to take the answer off the file. This case was distinguishable from those cited, for there the document which purported to be an answer was no answer at all, but in this case the answer was sufficient as far as it went. The reason why the answer had not been filed was explained in the letter to the plaintiff's solicitor, and then, instead of an answer saying it must be filed, he asks to see the proposed draught answer, wishing to find out what was the defendant's case.
The VICE-CHANCELLOR, without calling for a reply, said be might do as Lord Justice Knight Bruce had done in one of the cases referred to, and state that he confined his observations to the present individual case before him. He thought it as clear a case as ever came before the Court, and as gross a breach of the privileges given to defendants by the rules of the Court as he had ever witnessed. The time allowed for answering in the first place was short, the object being, where any difficulty existed, to enable parties to bring their cases to a hearing without delay; Dut wherever any reason could be alleged time was always granted, almost as a matter of course. Here the time was enlarged, first, for a month; then, by consent, for a fortnight, on three successive applications; and then a summons was taken out and an afidavit made thatbthe answer would be ready in a few days. That, of course, meant a real effective answer, and on that affidavit further time was given. Then a letter was written, saying that a day or two more was wanted. Another summons was taken out, butwhat was done on it did not appear. A letter, however, was written, saving that if time was not given the defendant mus ffile a short answer for the purpoea of having it excepted to, and thus get more time. He (the Vice-Chancellor) must beg to dissent from tbe propsition that when further time could not be got in the regular way it might be got by putting in an evasive answer. The only thing that bad ever created a question in his mind was that the plaintiff's solicitor, when be knew that this evasive answer had been filed, asked to look at the proposed answer; but it did not appear to him that he had waived his position by having made a proposal which was not acceded to. He would not go into an examination to ascertain whether or not the "thing" which was called an answer really did admit what was not disputed in the suit, but what was the common title to both parties. Assuming that it did sufficiently answer the first inferrogatory, it was manifest that it was not such an answer as the Court intended when it gave all that time to file it. He would say to solicitors-and, ho might venture to add, to counsel also-that whereetime had been given, and there appeared no reason for samy further indulgence, parties could not get indirectly, by such means as had been here attempted, that which they were not entitled to get directly. Hie had no hesitation in saying that this document must be taken off the file, ad defendant must pay the costs of the motion and aU costs which the plaintiff had been put to by its having been filed.

L TIM O1Xr: V. THET AY AH AM A-.--
(Sittings n Banco, beforc Lord CAiBrxrL and Justices
COLIXRIDO} and WIOHTDUXN.)
In this case a rule had been granted calling upon tho mayor and assessors of Rochester to show cause why a mandlamus should not issue commanding them to hold a court to revise the list of burgesses for that borough. There were several other rvles in a similar form, in some of which the defendants were also required to expunge, and also to insert certain names in the burgess list. The questions intended to be raised were as to whether there had been a good pblication of the burgess list, and also whether there
ad beenngood notices of objection, &c.
Sir F. TaESismcx (with whom were MIr. Petersdorff and Mr. F. J. Smith) now showed cause against the rule, and entered into a lengthened statement of the factb, with a view to show that the defendants had acted bondfide. The learned counsel took the objection that a mnamu would not lie in this case, inasmuch as the court had been held, and the mayor and assesors were functi officw.
Mr. Serjeant sicoLAXc; mentioned the case of the Queen v. the Mayor of Warwick" (21, L. J., Q. B., 193.), in which the writ had been granted in this form.
Sir F. TmxsxGim said that in that case the objection had not been taken.
Lord CaPB.XLL said tho Court would not decide the question in its present stae. An there was that decision the prosecutors were entitled to take the opinion of a
of Error. EHis Lordship, without oxiesnio an o a ur
then directed that the rales should be made atso in order that the qenestion might be argued on the record.
Mr. Serjeant 'GLAKs wished to abandon one of his rules, which was accordingly discharged w.ith costs
Mr. Edwin Jaines, Q.C., and Mr. Huddleston appeared for the new mayor.
Rules accordingly.
xX PARTE suLLP..
Mr. L CjLu4RS, Q.Cd, moved for a rule to show cause why a mandamunsu should not issue to the Bishop of LAnooin to hear and decide upon the appeal of the Rev. L. Buller
fromn a decision of the Provost and Fellows of King's 6C#
lege, Cambridge1 whereby the said M1r. BaIler had been: deprived of his feliowshl..} It appeared from the statement mnade by the learned counsel thaist in the yea 1821 Mlr. Buller was elected a aeholar of King'sCollege and in t'he year 1823 he, was chosea fellow. This eoutinuec downL to the Iear 1849, when eharg"e of fraucd and perjutry were made against him, Thepeajry3wUewastll&eeltoha, it~
in an answer to a b)l In Chanc t. TheP1rovost and Psilows of Kinb'c College 1ummone7 r.Boler, and, having~

lege. The bishop eventually decided that he had been properly removed, and confirmed the decision of the Provost and Fellows. The learned counsel now contended that the bishop had in sabstance declined jurisdliction, and had refeaed to hear the whole of the evidence. The bishop's letter, in which he had signified his decision, said: -! I thought it right to receive AMr. Biller's appeal So far as to inquire vhether the Provost and Fellows of King's CoUege, in declaring that the said Rev. L. Buller had incurred the forfeiture of his fellowship on the ground of manifest perjury, had evidence of the fact." Mr. Boler thought that the bishop had a more extensive jurisdiction, and wished him to hear an explanation of the circumstances under which he had sworn the answer in Chancery. On reference to the affidavit on which the learned counsel moved it appeared that subsequently to the bishop's decisiontbeapplicanthad applied to him to reconsider the case and adjudicate thereon, at the same time forwarding some farther evidence, and that the bishop replied that he saw nothing to justify him in reopening the case. The learned counsel cited the words of L,ord Kenyon in" H. v. the Bishop of Ely" (5, T. R., 475).
L2ord CASIPBELI.-T1is Couri would grant a mandamus for a new trial on an affidavit that evidence had been tendered and refused; but here the evidence was subsequently discovered. His Lordship, after some further discussion, said he thought there was no ground for the application. The case cited did not support the learned counsel's argument. It only decided that the Court would grant a rule ni,i if there was any reasonable ground for believing it would be made absolute. But there was no possibility of that here, for the Bishop of Lincoln, who was the visitor, had determined the appeal, and his decision was final. If the bishop had not heard the appeal, or had decided itwithout hearing, or that important evidence had not been heard, the Court wvould have interposed, for in that case the bishop would not have exercised his jurisdiction. But it now apTeared that the bishop had neither refused to hear nor to reeive evidence. He had heard all the evidence given before the Provost and Fellows, and that was a thatgwas tendered, and having done so the bishop's decision was final.
The other judges concurred. Rule refused.

The action was brought to recover the balance of a surveyor's bilL At the trial, which took place before Mr. Justice Cromspton, at Guildhall, it was agreed that the cause should be referred to a lay arbitrator, one of the jurymen. The arbitrator, having retired to a private room adjoining the court, said he should not swear any of the :itnesses, but he should go on with the case as if he were in his office. He said he had only taken the case to get away from the jury, and in a few minutes, without examnng any witnesses, he found for the plaintiff for the full amount.

This was an action by the drawer of a bill of excbange against the acceptor. An order having been made by a learned judge giving the defendant leave to appear to the action
Mr. HxRV JA,S now moved to rescind the order, on the ground that the defendant's affidavit did niot show any
fficient legal or equitable defence. The defendant on the 3d of June last was adjudged a bankrupt, and the bill in question, which was given to the plaintiff, an accountant, for making up the defendant's accounts, was accepted by thedefendant onthe 30th of June. The defendant said the plaintiff ought to have proved the debt in bankruptcy. He also relied on the 160th section of the Bankru pt Law Consolidation Act (12th and 13th Victoria, cap. 106), which authorized the Court of Bankruptcy to make allowances out of the estate for the preparation of the balance-sheet and accounts, in any case in which the Court should be satisfied that the bankrupt required such assistance. The learned counsel said the bankrupt did not say that there were any assets, nor that he had applied, or intended to apply, to the Court under the 160th section.

WOODLAND V. FEAR.
This was a rule to set aside a nonsiit. The action was brought by Stuckey's Banking Company to recover a sum of money from the defendant, under the count for money had and received to the plaintiff's use. It appeared at the trial, which took place at the last assizes for the county of Somerset, that the plaintiffs company carried on business under the style of " Stuckey's Banking Company," and had two offices, at Glastonbsry and Bridgwater, which were 14 miles apart. A customer of the bank, named HoeUer, drewr a check on the bank (Glastonbury branch) for the sum of 391. lls. The defendant presented the check at the Bridgwater Bank, and it was paid, but it was subsequently discovered that Helier had onl the sum of 211. in the bank, and was insolvent. The bank then called upon the defendant to refund, and on his refusal they brought the present action. At the trial Mr. Serjeant Channel thought the action could not be sustained, and nonsuited the plaintiff, but subsequently . rule was granted to set aside the nonsait.
Mr. hL SESve, Q.Q., and Mr. EDWARDS now showed cause against the rule, and, admitting that the bank might have refused to pay the check, contended that as they had poaid they could not recover it backc.

This was an action for fouling a -stream which pasged through the plaintiffs fields, so that his cattle would not

The plaintiff never assigned that the defendant fouled the said water beyond the prescriptive right claimed by him. The action was tried before Nr. Justice Coleridge at Ipswich, when it appeared that the defendant's tanning business had greatly increased within the last few years, ana that he had m consequence fouled the water much more than formerly. The judges held the plea to he proved, and directed averdict for the defedant. The Lntiffi having moved for and obtained a rule for a ne v , on the grount of misdirection, rae ntegon

The CotnIr were of opinion that the rule must be made absolute. The learned Judge appeared to have construed the new assignment as referring to something ultra the tannmn business. The plea might mean that the defendant Iaua right to as much water as he needed for his trade of a tanner on hsis premises, or only that he had a right to as much water as he had used on his premises for tanning purposes 20 years ago. The limited rsght would have entitled the plaintiff to a general verdict, but if the larger right was claimed by the plea, and not admitted, the ques. tion ought to nave gone to the jury; and if the larger right was established then the defendant would be entitled to the general verdict. There was nothing in the plea presenting an impediment to this question being left to the jury, and there must therefore be a new trial.

SPECIAL PAE.-MORGAIN V. THE MAYOR, &-C., OF
RTP'HVmTAU
(Sitings in Banco.)
This was a special case, framed by an arbitrator, to raise, for the opinion of this Court, the question whether the
laintiff, who is town-clerk of the borough of Birmingham,
h a right to make any demand upon the town-council for certain professional services rendered, or whether his claim was to be limited to the amount of the salary, which was 6xed at 8001. per annum on his appointment. The question thus raised seemed to turn upon the wording of the resolutions adopted by the town-council and of the reports of former committees, on which such resolution was founded, the language of the resolution being that in respect of such salary te plaintiff should "discharge all the duties routine and appurtenant to the said office." The services in respect of which the plaintiff made the claim in question appeared to consist of attendances on the town-council, correspondence, and journeys to london in respect of certain local bils, at the time before Parliament, introduced by or affecting the interest of the borough.
Mr. Bovill appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Serjeant Byles and Mr. Field appeared for the defendants.
At the couclusion of the arguments, which were stated on both sides to turn on points of law,
The COURT gave judgment in favour of the defendants. The right of the plaintiff to claim remuneration for extra services was rather a question of fact depending upon the precise nature of the bargain with the defendants than one of law, and, judging from the nature of the services rendered, it appeared that they fell within the ordinary duties and routine of the office of town clerk, but whether that were so or no, it was clearly the duty of the plaintiff to make out his claim to the satisfaction of the Court, by showing that the services did not fall within that routine, and that, if not, there had been an express contract that he should reoeive extra remuneration for them when and before he undertook them. The plaintiff had failed to make out this point, and the result was that there must be judgment for the defendants.
Judgment accordingly.

LARA V. TEGENERAL APOTHECARIES' COMPANY.
Mr. Doyle appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Overend for the defendants.
This was an action brought by the plaintiff against the defendants for an alleged breach of contract. The defenddants pleaded that they did not make the contract, as alleged
It appeared from the statement of the plaintiff's counsel that the defendants' company had been established for the purpose of supplying the public with pure drugs, &c., and in Neptember last they issued a notice stating that they would shortly publish 18,000 copies of a circular, and call. ing the attention of advertisers to the advantage of circulating their rivertisements bv its means. The plaintiff, Dr. Lara, being about to publisfi a medical work, offered the defendants 5-. for inserting an advertisement respecting it. They thereupon wrote a letter requesting him to send his advertisement as soon as possible, and he accordingly forwarded it to them, but for some unexplained reason another gentleman's book upon the some subject was advertised, and the plaintiff's work was not mentioned. He had consequently brought this aetion for the breach of the contract.
Before any witnesses were called on the part of the plaintiff,
Mr. OQEREitm submitted that the plaintiff must be nonsuited upon his own showing. It was evident that there was no contract at all between the parties. The plaintiff proposed to insert his advertisement in the defendans circulars, and they requested-him to send it for their inspection. He (Mr. Overend) apprehended that no newspaper or otber advertising medium could be compelled to insert any advertisement which might interfere with the circulation of the paper or have any immoral tendency. It was therefore evident that the insertion of advertisements was optional, unless the money was actually patid and the advertisement approved and accepted. The defendants had exercised their option and had not accepted the plaintiff's advertisement.
His LoRDshiiP said, in his opinion, there was no contract entered into on the part of the defendants to insert the plaintfs advertisement, and therefore the plaintiff must be nonsuited, or else there would be a verdict for the defendants.
A verdict was accordingly entered for the defendants.

M1r. Serjeant Thomas and Mir. J. O. Griffits appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Serjeant Ballantine for the defendant.
This was an action of trover, brought by the plaintiff, for. merly an unholaterer, but now a photographic artist, against the defendant, an electric instrument manufacturer, to recover a state chair. The defendant pleaded that the value of the chair was 51., which sum he paid into court,
It appeared that the plaintiff had been ordered in 1840 to make a state chair for the Duchess of Sutherland of the value of M6. For some reason the article, when finished, was not purchased by her Grace, and the chair havimg ot out of the plaintiff's hands, he had repurchased it in 1844 for 201. He then expended a sum of 61. in regilding it, and he subsequently sold it for 251. He appeared to have a great fancy for the chair, for in 1853 he again purchased it for 271. Having become a photographic artist, he used the chair as a throne on which to placethe persons whose lkenesses he was taking. At the end o 1853 the chair was sent to the defendant's premises to be taken care of, but when the plaintiff applied for it to be returned to him he was told that it had been sold to a Jew. He had thereupon brought this action.
The defence was that the chair had been brought to the defendant's house by the plaintiff's son, together with some other lumber. The plaintifs son owed him some money, and going away without paying it he had sold the things at an auction, where the state chair had fetched 41. 4s. It was therefore contended that the 51. paid into court was a sufli. cient compensation to the plaintiff for the loss of hischair.
Mr. Baron BRAMvznLhaving summed up'
The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for 51. beyond the sum paid into cou3rt.

This was,, suit promoted by the schooner jacht Viking of the burden of 110 tons, against the bark Ja.nes Holmes, of the burdea of 304 tons, to recover the loss arising from a colhiion between them at 8 p.lU. on the 22d of August last, off Beachy Head. The schooner was proceeding from Dover to Cowes, close hauled, as she stated, on thestar. board tack. After passing Beachy Head she descried the bark distant about four mAles, rather onx the port bow. When the barkhad arrived within three mUes, seeing she did not alter her course, the schooner exhibited alight, and luffed as close to the viud as she would lay to be in comnmand. When the vessels had approached within about 200 yards from each other the schooner hailed the bark to port, but no change vhatever was made in her course, and she ran stem on mbo the schooner, cutting her down to the water's edge. The bark was bound from Barbadoes to London, with a cargo of sugar, ruin, Ac., and 14 passeners, and, as she stated, at the time in question she was kept close in shore, with the view of running her ashore in the event of the quantity of water which she was making increaentg and rendering it expedient so to do. She was clos hauled on the port tack, and observed the light 6f the schooner distant about half a mile three.and-a.half points on the starboard bow. A bright signal light was umne. diately shown, but, as there was no riskc ofta collison had the vesels t their respective courses, they kept them until vti yrds, 'when the schooner suddenly ported her helm in ordaer to cross the hawse of the bark.

TEI ADMIAL BOOXER-COLISION.
The Silloth, screw steamship, of the burden of 198 tons, proceeding from Liverpool to Port Carlisle, in Cumberland, shortly after passing the Crosby lightship. at the entrance of the rive:r er1irsely' at 1 a.m., on the 30h of September last, descried the Adrairal Boxer and immnediately put her helm to port, and then h a-prt, whereby her course was altered from N.W. by W. toN, by E. The Admiral Boxer when first seen was, as represented by the steamer, distant about three miles and it was said that had she ported her helm, as it was ter duty to have done, she would have passed clear of the steamer, but instead of so doing she put her helm a-starboard, whereby, or from other mismanagement, in five minutes from the time she was first seen, she ran into the steamer, doing her considerable damage. The Admiral Boxer, an American vessel of the burden of 1,116 tons, was bound from Quebec to london with a cargo of timber. On arriving off Point Lvnas she took on board a duly licensed Liverpool pilot of the first class. When near the Crosby lightvessel, in abott midchannel, she observed the steamer distant a mile, a little on her port bow. The steamer in a short time, as stated by the Admiral Boxer, shut in her red light. whereupon the pilot ordered the helm of the Admiral Boxer to be starboarded by which, if both vessels had continued their respective courses, they would have gone clear of each other, hut jast as the Admiral Boxer was beginning to answerherstarboard helm the steamer suddenly opened out her red light, when the pilot ordered the Admiral Boxers helm bard a-port, but there was then no time to avoid a collision. Cross actons were brought by the respective parties. On.the part oi the Admiral Boxer it was contended that if she was to blame the fault rested solely with the pilot, who gave all the orders, and whose orders were strictly obeyed.
The Admiralty Advocate and Dr. Jenner were heard for the steamer; Dr. ;Bayfordand Dr. Twiss for the Admiral
The learned JUDG, after consmlting with the Elder Brethren, said they were of opinion that the Admiral Boxer was to blame forthe consequenoes of thecollision, having improperly starboarded her belm, and that no blame whatever
ttacd to the steamer, The erroneous order to starboard the helm was given, not by the master, but by the pilot, and consequently the pilot was to. blame for the colision. , UYnder those circumstances the suit must be dismissed, but

COURT OF BANKRUPTCY, Basinghall-street, Jan. 26.
COURT OF BANKRUPTCY, Binghastfrcv, Jan. 26.
vt l v csoar
(Before Mr. Comm2jsioner GOULBUBN.)
The bankrupt was the landlord of the Queen's Arms, Norwood.
A point was now raised of some importance to assignees and rties engaged in the beer trade. Messrs Truman. ran tury, and Co. held as security a deposit of the lease of the premises. The law also gives them a right over the fixtares. There was due at the time of the bankruptcy one quarter's rent; a few days after the bankruptcy another quaes rent accrued; and a third quarter accrued before the sale.
Mr. HiNDERSoN, for the assignees, contended that as the equitable mortgagees obtained a much greater benefit from the sale of the property than the assignees, the former *ought to pay the arrears of rent, or, at all events, that such arrears should be paid out of the whole proceeds of the property, paripassit.
Mr. BAGLEY, for the equitable mnortgagees& contended that the assignees should pay the whole arrears of rent, on the ground that the property they were entitled towas liable to have been distrained.
Bis HONOUR decided that, as to the first two quarters, they should be paid by the equitable mortgagees, as they were the vendors of the property, and the conditions of sale provided that the vendors should clear up all outgoins. As to the other quarter, he held that it should be paid by the assignees, as they had derived some benefit by the carrying on the business subsequently to the bankruptcy.
111 RE HURST.
The bankrupt was a manure manufacturer and chymist, of Rotberhithe and Newman's-court. This was the certificate meeting.
Mr. Cox appeared for the pssignees Mr. Chidley for creditors; and Mr. Lawrance for the banirupt.
It appeared that in June last the bankrupt petitioned the Court for private arrangement. The prayer of the petition was granted. An offer of 8s. in te pound was made to the creditors. That offer the bankrupt wasunable to carry into effect. It was now urged that the bankrupt had acted improperly and wasted his estate by incuring costs under the petition for arrangement.
Mr. iNKLA.TXB,. stated that, while acting for the bankrupt during the period referred to, a sum of 20C. had been received from the bankrupt's estate. The whole of that amount, minfu a small sum for pressing and unavoidable disbursements consequent upon carrying ou the business, had been handed to the official assignee immediately upon bankruptcy ensuing. He (Mr. Linlklater) had not retained a single shillin on account of his costs as the bankrupt's solicitor; nothing, in short, had been retained beyond the amount of cash actually paid and out of pocket, as already stated. He always felt that the filing of a petition for arrangement ought to be regarded as a dividing point, and was particularly careful that all funds should be properly nd equitably administered.
The bankrupt, on being exAmined, confirmed the accuracy of Mr. Linklater's statement.
Mr. CHDLEY said, he called for a suspension of the bank. rapt's certificate on the ground of most reckless trading. His accounts commenced in January, 1852, with a deficiency of llOb Being thus without capital, be had gone on trading il a most recless and improvident manner. His debts were tow 17,0001., and the estate, they had just been informed, would only pay about Is. in the pound. The amount paid for interest and discount only had been nearly 3,0001., and had exceeded the entire amount of the profits. The losses, on the contrary, had been continuous and enormou, includ, ing 9971. on share transactions, and one of considerable mag nitude on coal contracts. The bankrupt ought not, inJune las, to have deluded his creditors in respect to their beir paid 8s. in the pound, and kep thema ar length
month of October. Notwithstanding warning after warn, ing-either the interest or the trade expenses exceeding the profits-he had gone on recklessly making bad worse, until they now found that the deficiency was about 14,0001.
Mr. LAMRAINCE said, his friend Mr.Chidley had made use of that strong and powerful term " reckless,' but he did not consider it to apply to the present case. The utmost that could be said was that the bankrupt had carried on a large trade unsuccessfUlly. Beyond the payment of a sum to the accountants for preparing his accounts during the period intervening between the arrangement and the bankruptcy, not a single shilling had been disbursed which would not have been paid by the official assignee.
Eis HONOJUR said, that in petitioning the Court for arrangement, the bankrupt had only done that which the law permitted, but he thought he had not acted fairly. Only a portion of the creditors knew of the arrangement, and it was open to grave objection that a trader, by means of filing such a petition for arrangement, should be permitted to retain possession of and control over hispropertv Creditors might not even know of this arngement. No advertisement was necessary, and creditors were without protection. The act had been some time in operation, and it did not operate beneficially. Not one in ten of the petitions for arrangement ended in anything but bankruptcy, and the petitions generally resulted in disappointment and annoy. ance to the debtor as well as dissatisfaction to the creditor. Among the evils consequent upon these petitions was thisthe costs were very much larger than when the trader came at once to bankruptcy. Without stopPinz to inquire at this stage whether the bankrnpt's conducf had otherwise been.faulty, he might observe that he had been guilty of a gross and deliberate inaccuracy of statement in respect to circumstances attendant upon that arrngement. It was shown that what he had stated was untrue. To come to the other part of the case he could not agree with Mr. lawrance that the term " rechless" was not applicable to the conduct of the bankrpt. Being without capital, and having only profits to the amount of 2,0471., the bankrapt's trade expenses had been 2,7461., his ersonI expenses 1,341. ; the amount paid for interest and dsount was 2,2731., and the losses had been between 6,000Z. and 7,0001. The losses included " jobbing in shares. What right had the bankrupt to thus *'job 'in shares? By the course pursued there was an expenditure, in cluding losses, to the extent of 11,001. orl2 001. against 2,0001. of profits. The bankrupt's conduct had en reless and improvident in the extreme, and there would be asusension of his certificate one year from the date of his petition for arrangemendt (Jtune last. bInconsideration of -his unexceptionable condct sncethe anlrupty te cetifcate would then be of the second and not of ed class. Thebankrupt would receive protection during the suspension.

mitted for trial, and a witness nained Bacon was ordered to find hail in 5O., and to enter into his own recognizances in 1001., to appear and give evidence at the trial.
Bow-rTxnr.-A young woman with a child at her breast, who gave the name of 'ranciska Wesneiska, and said she was a native of Warsaw, was charged with atealin a purse, containing some sUver and a "c ommuniontoken,
during the service at Dr. Camming's chapel on Sunday norning.
From the statement of the cornplainant, a married lAdy named Cole, it apteared that the prisoner entered the pew in which she wa sitting, and took a seat close by her ade. Somne time afterwards, on feeling in her pocket for her turpe, In order to take out the token (which resembled a
onn someahat in appearance, and was usually given to communicants), complainant discovered that it had been stolen. She at once suspected the prisoner, and caused her to be detained until a constable could be procured, upon which she was given into custody. The token and money were found in the possctsion of the prisoner, who threw the purse into one of the adjoinieg pewe, where it was aftewards picked up. She had evidently supposed the "thken toh e acoi of the realm.
The prisoner affected to know nothing of Englisb, although the officer had heard her speak the languae Eventually an intrpreter was obtained, and, through him, she denied the charge, declaring that the token was given to her by a young man who made an aDpointmen' witE her ,at 3icoffeehose.
Mr. HAuL committed her for trial.
A donation of 55. was received from " C. 1L 1" for the poor-box.
V&wzoRouGEisTREnr.John Pumpbrey, cab-driver, Wsassnmoned by the Roal Soc;ety for the Frevertion of Cruelty to Aimals for illusing a horse.
Heffer, one of the society's constables, id he was on duty in Flentstreet about 5 dclock in the morning, when Le saw the defendant driving a horse which appeared to be in a very miserable condition. He stopped the defendnt andl asked if the animal had anything the matter with its ba The defendant replied in the negative, but on witIess looking at the back he found a large wound, whichx was di6chrging. He next examined the animal's mnees, and fonind one had a deep wound irn it, wh:ehi had been plugecl u D with some stuff and blacked over Having his Itern
Pwth him he examined the anima4, and feund it bad been
cruelly whipped in the vwy termed by drivers ' foul "-that is, the lash had been directed against the stomach of the anim2l so as to draw blood and cause great tortuLre. He examined the defendant's whip, and found four knots tied in the lash.
Akother constable corroborated this evidence, and added that one of the knots on the lash was what c;bmen term
Ta blood kot," as blood was msre to follow the blow.
The driver said a better horse to work could not be. It was true that one of the knees was badly cut, but that was owing to the fact of the animal having slipped down. There was no wound on the back when he brought out the cab, and as to the knots in the whip, they must have tied themselves as he flourished the whip about.
The constables said the wounds 'were old ones, and the horse was a wretched half-staxved pony, quite unfit for cab work.
Mr. Wemyss, who attended for the society, said it was the practice of cabmasters to send out horses in a disgraceful condition to do nightwork.
Mr. BESAIOm said the case was a very had one, and he should inflict. a fmo of 20a., or one month's imprisonment.
Mr. BxAnON has received 56 from " G. EL C.," and I. from " L U. S C.," for the poor-box.

Mr. P&yynn,on lookdng at the police charge-sheet, remarked ta prisoner had given neither her occupaton

Mr PAYNTxn.-It strikes me you have not. You ppear to be a well-educated person, and I should think you mould not have been brought to the condition you describe with. out some imprudence of your own.
Prisoner.-I have been wel brought up, but no matterI will notexplain what I have been. I have told you wh&i I-an, but I tell you honestly *nd truthfully I would take the coat off your own hack if I could, sooner than I 'would starve about unfriended, unpitied, as I have done of late.
- Mr. P&.y B remanded the prisoner for a week, and desired the police to use their best endeavours to learn something about her.
Julius Kirc'hberg, a poor Prassan, solicited the magistrate'sassistance underthefollowg c mstances
He stated that on -the 14th of November, 1855, he was enlisted for the lend Transort Corps, and duly attested on the 16th. On his going to the office of Qaartermaster Stevens he was told that his services would be disensed with on account of his being a Prussan, but on the 29th of the following September he wU arrested and charged with being a deserter. On the 1st of October he was brought to this court and committed, umtil claimed by the authorities of the War-office. He was imprisoned at the House of Detention until the 16th, when he was conveyed to Horfield Barracks, near Bristol, where he was under restraint until the 14th of November, when, without undergoing any trial by court -martial, he was tarned out penniless with a discharge stating that he had been rejected as unfit for service.
Mr. PAYNTEJ suggested that he should make an application to the Secretary of War.
Applicant said that he had done so, but could obtain no redress for the injustice and inmury he had received. If he was deemed a pnvate in the Land Transport Corps, after being told that his services were not required, surely he was entitled to the pa up to the period of his discharge. He had Sota solicitor to write three letters to the War-office, but they were unheeded. He thought he had been very cruelly treated, and had been told that the magstrate by 'whom he had been committed (Mr. Paynter) would givehi
Mr. PAvmTEB assured him that he had beenmsinformed. It having been sworn before him (the magistrate) that he was a deserter, he had no othercourse but to commit him.
Applicant observed that he had been informed his Minister could not ,nterfere in a matter of this description, so he had been denied the suecour he had looked for in that quarter.
hlr. PAm'sma said he had no powver to assist him, and applicant withdrewr.
WonsnsrR-sz.--James WaUlby, alas Phillips, alias "ITbe Countryman," and rgeorg Cole were charged before hIr. EYEyNCoUxT with the folowing daring robbery.
Mrs.HamnahWagstaffe, wife of a jeweller in Brown's-lane, SpitaBields, stated that 'while sitting in her shop-parlour at fl o'lock on the preceding niht she heard a sudden smash of glass, and on rn g ito the shop she saw one of her shop panes broken and a man's hand through the orifice; before she could cry out br do anything the hand next smashed the glass of a jewel-case in the window, and stole two watches, both of which she could now swear to, though damaged, and ahe could also swear to the hand being that of the prisoner Waliby, whom she distinctly aw at the time tdandirg in the street.
John Moule said he was pasiDng the shop, when he heard a cry of " Stop thief !" and the prisoner WaUby ran past him, flinging something awfay, which struck the witnesrs leg, and on picking it up it turned out to be a gold watch, the case of which was open sad the glass was out
George Baker, a wheelwright, also heard the cry of "Stop thief!1" followedl by "a i clamour of feet," and the prisoner passed him in full flight. Witness turned and pursued him into Spital-street where he caught him in his arms. Prisoner saidl "It's al right; it's only a lark," and tried to get away, but witness replied, "Yes, it's all right now," and, in spite ef his determined attempts to escape, held him untl a constable came up and secured him.
Williamson, of the H divsion, deposed to receiving the prisoner Wallby and the two watches, the second picked up bya boy namedJames and that on examining his hands he found one of them much cut.
Mr. IYEvKcouRT ordered his hands to be exxmined again, and three of his fingers were found to be much cut, evidently with broken glass, though the prisoner protested they were but scratches.
The other man, Cole, was proved to have been watching about the neighbourhood of the prosecutor's house while the robbery was being committed, and to have taken rapidly to his heels on its detection. He was stopped bya butcher, who let him go, but was afterwards securea by the police,
Watts, of the N division, identified the prisoner Wallby as a character well known to him, whose right name was Philps, and said in that name he was sent from this court for aformer watch robbery, convicted, and sentenced to two yearse imprisonment.
This that prisoner denied, maintaining that his name was Wallby; but
bIr. bu'tcouRT remanded them both, with the intimation that be should send the case for trial
CRxmvEi. , -Yesterday afternoon an immense multitude of persons, consisting of mechanics, labourers, and others, assembled in the front of this office to seek the advice and assistance of Mr. CoRRr, in consequence of having been refused relief by the parish authorities of ILington.
The complaining parties,it appeared, had formed part of a large meeting yesterday in Smithfield of unemployed arUtsans; after which they proceeded in strong bodies to the parishes of Clerkenwell and Ilington to seek relief when their formidable numbers caused some sensation and alarm; and Mr. Martin, superintendent of the G division, had previously communicated that such a visit might be anticipate at the court, and that officer was in attendance.
George Bent, a man of respectable appearance, said he snd a Mr. Kendall were there, in the absence of Mr. Macheath, to represent the aggrieved unemployed. He gBent) redded in George-street, Bagnigge-we3s-road, St.
Mr. COBRAx directed that those who wished to complain hould be admitted into the court, when a rush was made and it was instantly crowded to excess by an anxious motley group,
Bent said they had applied to , lington parish and were refused relief, but some were relieved at ClerkenwelL They applied to his worship for advice to get rehef and assistance in aI PI nd pabeale way.
Mr%a'. 'edXl, decoray. painter, said he was em Floyed four or five days a-week. He had a wife and three chldren, who were starving. They applied with others to
lington parish, and were told that they could not be relieved, except from 9 to 12 o'clock in the forenoon.
'Hugh Fieroe, ajoiner, of 12, Caledonian-road, Islington, said he was notin actual distress, but he didanot know how soon he might be. He came ss the representative of those who were unemployed, because if such things continued they would lead to a revolution in the country.
'Henry Hunt, a painter and glazier of Rosoman-streetNorth, sad he was out of work, with a wife and tbree children. He had not a morsel of food at home nor money to procure it, or he would not apply there or to the parish. He aTppled to the parish of Is1ington and was refused relief, and si somethingf were not done he did not know what 'would become of them.
Mr. CORRIE.-Yours is a case that I can practically ded with. Are there any other cases here?
A Voice.-Yes, Sir, 6OO here, and as many more outside the court.
Other statements of an equally painful and distressi,g nature were made.
Mr. CoRmix ordered an officer to go instantly in. a cabriblet ad to request the immediate attendance at the court of one of the pash officers of Islington.
fr Hicks, a relving efficer, attended just before the clong of the court with r, Bayli, the chief usher.
Mr. CoIt eplainedj matters, and suggested that the applcants night oe propeily attended to and relieved according o their ecitonecessities,
nrghntwiks i hwould attend instantly to the most
e paties then left the court to go to the workhouse.

Lights In The China Sea.
LIGHTS IN THE CHIrVA SEA.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMS.
Sir,-In a former letter, which you were god enough to publish in 2%c Itime of the 30th of December last, Iven. turea to point out to all concerned the absolute necessity of estabishing as soon as posaible a light on the Pratas, for the
roteotion of life And property in that portion of the China Ka; and the sppalling losses that take place annually on these reefs, whic are in the direct track of the trade, ought to be suficient to satisfy the most indifferent that its establishment i imperatively called for. Will you allow me now to refer to the following passage. in that letter :-viz. "It has been doubtless, in trying to keep clear of Ocacn that so many vessels have bcen wrecked on the Pescadoreg and Formosa; and to theperils of shipwreck on theso inhospitable shores has been superadded in almost every case, the unmi ated hostility of the inhabitants. 1any vessels must have been castaway here of which no account has ever been readered."
Now, Sir, it is not a little singular that the last mail from Crina should have brought us information that owin to a rinn having ben offerodfor sale at Canton, a clue habeen diseovered to the fate of tho crew and passengers of the clipper Kelpie, supposed to be lost with aU hands in io96, and that the survivors are at thig moment in captivity, working at some sulphur mines in the I;land of Formosa. The distress occasioned by this intelligence to the relatives of these unhappy people may be imagined, and their immediate release wil dounles be undertaken byoour Governmeat; but the circumstance is one I would fain take advantage of to urge forward-the construction of lighthouses in the Formom Channel, as well as on the Pratbs, and shall conclude with an extract bearing upon the subject from the same journal which I qoted from bfore-
"July 14, 160.-This morning we were off Dauburg Iland and the Nob Rock, but drifted slowly down with the declining breezo towards the Brothers, the bluff point of Tonsang, the Old Thunder Head of Horsburg, in siFht. I had here an illustration of the danger attending this navigation. The next night ws clear overhead, but thehoriron misty ssuui;the wind forced meto steer for the passage inside the Lamock group. At 3 am. on the 15th I was informed they were in dght, ani it was some time before I dicovered that the islands reported were the Brothers, whch we had cleared before dark, but which a strong current'hadsetusdownupon. Haditbeen thick weather we should have been in a serpe, for tho xoundings were not of the slightest use in denoting the ship's position. This is not the first time that I have experienced the difi culty of navigating clear of these islands, and it appears to
me that a light on the outer LTAnock is almost as necessary' at this end of the Formosa Channel as one on Ooseu or Turnabout for the security of the other. Would that those nost interested could be induced to stir in this matter. The epse would be compartively triffing. In the Nastic Jegazrine for 1846, p. 172, there is a proposl by Mr. AleyAnder Gordon, C.B, to deliver at the site of the Hlormburg lighthouse, now building in the Straits of Sin
pore, a. wrought-iron tower, 100 feet high, 18 feet in diameter At the base, and 10 at the top, to be previously fixed and tried in Englaud, for3,000h Now, two such lighthouses, with the expense of erecting them, and including the in. cressed freight for the additional distance, would not exoced between 9,000. and 10,0001., a sum small indeed compared with the loss of one of the many valuaile ships that now have to run the gauntlet of these dangers "
Within four years after the above lines were penned the Larrston, a beautiful screw steamer, was lost on the island of Turnabout, and the value of ship and freight would have built more thsn 10 such lighthouses as the one proposed by Mr. AKlexander Gordon.
I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your obedient servant.

His Rloyal Hlighness the General Commauding.in-Chief Will hold a lov6e at 1 o'clock on Friday next.
A return has been forwarded to the War Department from the coummanding officers of corps at Chatbnam garrison, specifying the number of men in their respective regiments -who will complete their period of 10 years' service in the present year, and also in 1858. Similar returns have also beenprepared of the number of non-commissioned officers and men who will have completed 21 years' service in the same years.
It is the intention of the authorities to discharge those men belonging to the corps of Royal Engineers at Cbatham who are of bad character, and with this view a return has been ordered of the names of all those men belonging to that corps whose charaoter is of such a description, in order that they may receive their discharge forthwith.
The Government having decided on the erection of a large prison at Norfolk Island for the reception of convicts under sentence of transportation, an order has been forwarded from the War-office to Colonel H. Sandham, director of the Royal Engineers' establishment, at Brompton Barracks, Chatham, directing him to hold in readiness onecompany of that corps, with a proportion of officers and non-commissioned officers, to embark forthwith for Norfolk Island, for the purpose of assisting in the erection of the convict establishment at that station.
A course of lectures has been arranged to be delivered to the troops at Chatbam garrison during the remaining -winter season by several officers and gentlemen of the neighbourhood. The first lecture of the course was delivered on Friday evening last, and the experiment of pro. viding this kind of entertainment for the soldiers of the garrison was attended with complete success, the lecture being well attended not only by the troop;, but also by many of the officers. The slubject of the next lecture is " Great Battles and Great Victories," which will be delivered on Friday evening next by the Rev. J. Davis, of Rochester, to be followed by one on the steam-engine, by Lieutenant Walker, RE.
The Industry steam storeship arrived at Portsmouth on Sunday from the Thames, with machinery for the Diadem, &c.
The Buffalo steam-vessel arrived at Spithead on Sunday from the westward, and sailed in the evening for the Thames.
A very unpleasant occurrence took place yesterday at Portsmouth. A man who has only been 195 days in the Royal Marine Artillery corps, and been confined several times for bad conduct, incurred a debt of 8s. for slops he bad " taken up"; this sum the captain of his company said should be put against his account on the books of the corps, whereupon the man used an insulting expression, and said he would do no mole soldiering uatil he was paid; this led to a court-ruartial last Friday, which adjudged him to receive 50 lashes yesterday. On his being taken towards the place of punishment under escort he broke away from his guards and rushed upon Colonel Parke (the commandant of the corps) as he was stooping to pick up a paper he had dropped, and gave him a tremendous blow in the face, knocking him to the ground and cutting him in the face very severely. The man was speedily overpowered and led to the halberds, where the 50 lashes were inflicted. He will now be tried for striking the Colonel, which will be rather a more serious affair than the flogging.
The paddlewheel steamvesscl Sprightly, tender to the Victory, in charge of Master-Conimander Allen, arrived at Woolwich from Portsmouth on Saturday, bringing a number of supernumerary seamen, who were yesterday morning distributed on board the gunboats Hinter, Handy, Garnet, and Fenella for conveyance to Portsmouth. The Hunter is commanded by Second-Master Sallenger, the Handy by Second-Master Witts, the Garnet by Second. M-aster Follett, and the Fenella by Second-Master Moore. They are manned with a crew of 28 men each.
The steam troop-ship Dee (on particular service) sailed from Woolwich yesterday, at 3 o'clock pus., laden with boilers and machinery for the 91 screw steamship Algiers, and will convoy the gunboats to their destination.
The iron paddlewheel steamvessel Princess Alice (tender to the St. Jean d'Acre) left Woolwich yesterday morning in charge of Captain Smithett and a crew of the Royal Mailpacket Company's service men for Dover, having been gratuitously placed at the disposal of the company for service between Dover and Calais.
The removal of the new Seamen's Hospital Caledonia having been necessarily delayed on account of the tides, she was yesterday miorning taken in tow by the steamers Monkey and Widgeon, and, having been removed to her moorings at Greenwich, was lashed alongside the Dreadnought to be eventuaUy secured there. The Dread. nought is ordered to be conveyed to Woolwiell at the ensuing spring tide-about 14 days hence-to be broken up. The Caledonia (to be named henceforth Dreadnought) is completed, with the exception of the scrten-work to form the chapel and a few slight arrangements connected therewith. Mr. AMacdonald, master-attendant at Woolwich Dockyard, and Mr. Mugford, commander of the Commodore's ship Fisgard, are charged with the removal and installation of tlse Caledonia, and pr oeceeded to Greenwich with a party of riggers yesterday morning for the purpose of laying down the necessary moorings.
The freight-ship Priscila, laden with Ordnance stores and ammunition from Woolwich Arsenal, sailed on Saturday from Gravesend for Cape Coast Castle.
The freight-ship Challenge, with a cargo of army clothing and ausnunition from Woolvich for Gibraltar, sailed on Sunday from Deal.
The freight-ship Julindur, having embarked three tons of ball cartridge, sailed ydstcrday from Woolwich for Sierra Leone.
The freight-slip Baneside, laden with Ordnance stores and ammunition fromi: Woolwich for Melbourne, hove anchor on Sunday from 0iavesend.
The freight-ship Vesta, having shipped 25.1 tons of ammunition, rockets, gun cartridges, live shells, rocket tubes, and powder, sailed yesterday from Woolwicls for Rio Janeiro.
A number of Russian and other guns, loaded for action in the Crimea, and brought home in that state, have been ordered to be discharged. These guns, amounting to about 300, and varying in calibre, are being fired at the proof butt in Woolwich Arsenal, averaging from 10 to 12 daily.
A new kind of pumping and fire engine, made under the directiol of Messrs. Rennie and Son, having been ordered by the Lords of the Admiralty for the use of the dockyard Woolwich, was yesterday subjected to a first trial under the inspection of Mr. Atherton, superintending engineer of the yard, assisted by Mr. Taplin and other members of the department. The principal object for which the new engine is about to be purchased is for draining the caissons at the miouth of the basins, as well as to use in case of fire. The peculiarity of the engine is its very small dimension. The system is that of the disc, and the engine drives a pump at the average rate of about 300 revolutions per minute. The diameter of the engine itself is only 13 inches; its height, togetlser with the framework and carriage, is Gft., and 6ft. in length, the whole of which, together with the boiler. weighs only two tons. The pump was driven at the rate of from 300 to 400 strokes per mninute, and answered the expectations formed as to its capabilities admirably. The facility of trausporting the engine while under the action of performing its ordinary revolutions renders it available in any spot required without stopping the machinery. It was estimated that the column of water projected during the tral to the heighat of from 120 to 130 feet was at the rate of 30 tons per hour. The power of the engine has been tested with a friction break, and proved to be that of about six horses.
In The Times of the 19th inst. it was stated, on the authority of letters from Rio Janeiro, that the steam sloop Cruiser, Commander Charles FeUowes, had been in coilision with the Swedish bark Therese, which tore away one of the guns of the sloop and did other damage. It was added that the officer in charge was a midshipman, and that the court of inquiry held on board the Cruiser had, in
-their comnsunication with the Lords of the Admiralty, censured the captain for giving this duty to a juinior officer on such an important occasion as that of nearing so frequented a port as tio Janeiro. A relative of Captain Feilowes requests us to insert the following account of the occurrenco from the Plymotzth Mail. That paper, after denying the assertion that Captain Fellowes had received the condeunation of the court of inquiry for leaving his ship in charge of a midshipman, says:-
"NPAs soon as the accident was reported to Rear-Admiral HoDe Johnstone, Commander-in-Chief on the South American station, a court of inquiry was ordered to assemble to inquite into the circumstances. The Court comprised the following officers :--Captain Hope (Indefatigable), Captain Otway (Siren), and Commander W. G. Luard (Indefatigable). The evidence adduced before this Court completely exculpated Commander Fellowes. Not only were there lights in the steamer, but they had been visited and reported on by a midshipman only 10 minutes before the collision. The officer in charge of the deck at the time was ltrd Kilcoursie, a midshipman, who it was proved had odone everything under the circumstances the oldest and most esperienced seaman could have done. The master of the Ouiser was in bed, and the first lieutenant on the sick list, wich accounts for an officer of the rank of midshipman beiog in cli&o at the time of the collision. Immediately

Ori the nt reoi'ng, the Swedish captain came to the ganvway ana exclain'ed in English, 'My God, we were all asleep.' 'The force of the collision may be imagined front' the fact that the bulwarks of the Cruiser were completely smaehed, her shronds and iibboom carried away, and her foremast gus knocked over. The Swede had her foretopmast carried Away, and was otherwise so severely damaged as to be asbliged to zeturn to jio. blhe was 4eeply laden with

To The Editor Of The Times.
TO TIlE BDITOR OF THE TIMBS.
Sir,-The letter of your correspondent " Vulcan!' in support of monster cannon, and more particularly in praise of the Liverpool gun, will not provoke the authorities of Woolwich to break the official silence which, in common with other departments of the State, it is their custom to observe under external censure. They no doubtconsider themselves precluded from discussing questions of the kind with civilians; yet it is not improbable that they may have strong facts and sound reasons founded on the laws of mechanical science for treating pieces of ordnance weighing more than 20 tons with the disfavour which "Vulcan" ascribes to them. It by no means follows that because by a tour de force a long-range gun, throwing an immense projectile, has been manufactured of wroughtiron at the Mersey NWorks the Axtillery arm of the service should be reconstituted on that modeL If greater, or even equal results can be obtained from less unwieldy and less expensive implements, common sense indicates that they should be preferred. In fact, the fundamental rule which determines a selection in this as in everything else is the muvimumn of performance from the minimum of expenditure. No one who knows anything about mechanics can look at a great gun, or see it worked, without feeling that the true direction for artillery science to take is to get ont of lighter and more portable ordnance at least as great, if not a larger amount of effectiveness than is obtained by the enormous calibres now used. As the London drayhorse was at one time brought to such a size that he broke down under his own weight, and as the marine engine for ocean steamers was formerly constructed of parts so ponderous that sound workmanship was unattainable, so in gunnery does the course of experiment indicate that we have been straining in a direction to which rhe natture of the materials used has affixed limits which cannot in the present state of our knowledge regarding them be safely or advantageously passed. Take the case of this very Liverpool gun. It is a splendid piece of forging undoubtedly, but a large flaw exists at the bottom of the bore, to remedy which a piece of the metal about eight inches in diameter has been lapped out and plugged up with a screw. I do not say that it is much the worse for this, but the same defect might have occurred in any other part, and clearly indicates the exceptional character of the work. Again, the makers have objected to a higher charge than 501b. of powder, being about 1-6th of the weight of shot, whereas with iron gunsgenerallythe proportion is 1-3d. Of 10 shots fired with it at 18° of elevation the mean range was 5,000 yards, with an average deviation of 98 yards. Now, the French marine gun throws a shell of 601b. with 711b. of powder a mean range of 5,500 yards at 156 of elevation. The Americans have shell guns of still greater calibre, and our own with llb. of powder has a range of 7,500 yards, with a deviation of not more than 20 yards. There can be no doubt that one ortwo of the latter would "sew up" the monster cannon in half an hour. The experiments which Mr. Whitworth has for some tirme past been engaged upon with reference to rifled guns, and the results which he has obtained, indicate the only right conclusion of this mach vexed question; and the letter of " Vulcan" is only calculated to mislead the public by raising its expectations in the wrong direction. What is wanted is a cannon light enough to be easily handled, and throwing with increased precision and increased penetrating power a projectile as heavy, or even heavier, than those now in use. Guns rifled polygona]ly and firing a polygonal belt, the leng,th of which is only lfimited by the pitch of the rifling, promise all these results, and give us at length some assurance of a stride in artillery science which the nation has long watched for impatiently. Besides Whitworth, Armstrong of Newcastle, a most distiDguished mechanic, has been, as a recent letter of his shows, assiduously and successfully engaged in solving the great difficulty of rifled cannon. If these and other eminent men similarly occupied should fail in accomplishing what is desired there still remains good reason for believing that malleable iron can be cast into guns with enormous tenacity, at a cost somewhat more within compass than the 6,000. whichthe Liverpool monster is said to have been manufactured for. To show that this is no idle conjecture, I may mention that the Americans have already got a cast gun which throws a sheU containing 301b. of powder as far as the "monster" can range. If one of these missiles were to burst " betwecn decks" it is not difficult to imnagine what a sensation it would create.
" Vulcan" has got hold of " the wrong end of the stick," for I cannot suppose that his object has merely been, under cover of an attack on the Ordnance committee, to puff the Mersey Iron Company for their gift to the nation. Had he directed public attention to the enormous development of manufacturing establishments at Woolwich Arsenal and at Enfield, and to the danger of permitting Government departments to run a-muck of competition, backed by the State purse, against the private trade of the country, he would have been more usefully employed and done better service to the military art. Notvwithstanding the great ablilty which the officers charged with the formation of these vast establishments have displayed, and the magnitude and even splendour of the arrangements, I feel confident that the experiment of the Government manufacturing its own armament will break down, and that with the progress of invention we shaU be every day less inclined to lean for our weapons of defence upon any source of supply less certain and abundant under reasonably good management than the industry and ingenuity of the people at large. I am assured that we are all quite mistaken about the innocaous effect of 6S-pounder sbot on wrought-iron plates, and that the armour of the floating batteries would not protect them from sinking under a vigorous cannonade; but I quite agree with " Vulcan" that so important a matter should be thoroughly tested, and that the War Department would be much more usefully employed in experimenting upon such points, and in developing with regard to them the mechanical resources of the country, than in the vain attempt to produce its own war wtd6ricl. But peace has returned, and with it many of the questions which the recent European convulsion has raised wil probably be allowed to go to sleep once more. The olud leaven stil remains largely present both in the military and scientiticbranches of the army, and, if history had not already sufficiently demonstrated the fact, recent events only too clearly prove that England can never inscribe upon her shield the motto, " Semper parata." Let us, however, at least ascertain what arethe verybest imDlements for fighting purposes, and, as far as a smalU army goes, how to use them to the greatest advantage. WVith these precautions we need not feel uncomfortable, though no more monster guns should be manufactured or monster ships to carry them in harmless grandeur over tha sea.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

WONDERFUL, IF TRUE.-A small Paris journal
NVONDItFUIL, iF TRuE.-A small Paris journal called Lcs Contemporains, has just published a most strange account, signed " He iPage," of an aerostatic excursion which the article declares has solved the long-canvassed problem of directing balloons. The persons who are stated to have made the excursion are the Count de Pleuvier, M. Gavarn M. Mligeon, Mr. Falconer, an English aeronaut, and aM. Henri Page, the writer. The apparatus used is stated to have cost not less than 300,000f., the greater portion of which was furnished by Count de Pleuvier. The machine is represented as consisting of two balloons united together, of a spherical form, able to contain each 100 cubes of pure hydrogen gas. The directing power is a miodified screw communicating with the car, and a rudder, made prncipally of whalebone, to change the direction when required M. Gavarni, the inventor, it is declared, ean obtain the upward movement of the balloon without throwing out ballast, which system soon exhausts the resources of the very best constructed balloon, and becomes an invincible obstale to long excursions in the air. The loss of hydrogen is instantaneously repaired by a chymical proceeding of which M. Migeon is stated to possess the secret, and by a little apparatus of communication, also invtnted by M. Gavarni. The descent is effeoted, as hitherto, by letting the gas escape. The departure of the aeronauts on the occasion referred to took place on the 15th of January, at 10 in the morning, from the park of Ferridres, in the Sologne; and the next morning, at 5, the aerial travellers effected a safe descent within half a mile of Algiers. ' We received," says the account, " the mlost touching hospitality. The inhabitants wanted to carry us in triumph, but we declined the honour; and as soon as we could, went to take some repose, leaving our aerostatic apparatus under the guardianship of a Sfle of Zonaves.. Marshal Pandon deigned to congratulate us, and pressed the hand of M. Gavarni with the utmost waramth. We remained on the African soil only 30 hours, ind left at noon the day after our arrival, in sight of an imnmense multitude who had assembled to see us ascend from the Mole. Our returu was effected without the slightest incident, but with muich greater rapidity. At half-past 4 the next morning we alighted at the spot from whic we started, in the park of Count de Pleuvier."

E Double Murder In Walworth.
E DOUBLE MURDBR IN WALWORTH.
Yesterday Mr Bacon made a fuller confession of the guilt of her husband, but it does not differ widely from that which she made on Wednesday last at Lambeth police. court, and the reading of which caused so extraordinary a sensation. If, however, the addition which she now supplies is true-and there is no reason at present to disbelieve it-the vilainy of her husband seems to be of a deeper dye than the dreadful offence of cutting the throats of his poor infant children in cold blood had made it. Mrs. Bacon now says, that it was afterdestroying the life of the younger child that her husband attacked her; and not only attempted to cut ber throat but inflicted several scars on it. She repeats that she got hold of him by the wrist of the right hand, in which he held the knife, with both her hands and thus prevented him from reaching her throat. She further states that, as soon as her husband could release himself from her hold, he drew a rope from his pocket andtthrew it roundher neck, endeavouring to preven; her making a noise, and forcing her on the bed rushed oat of the room. In confirmation of her assertion on this point it is a positive fact that, when taken to Horemonger-lane Gaol on the Tue sday evening (the following day) the matron of that prison distinctly noticed a livid mark round th3 neck such as would be produced by a rope or some hard liga. ture tied tightly round it, and it struck her to be of so singular a character as to induce her to call the attention of the prison surgeon to it. The first day of his confinemen . in Horsemonger-lane Gaol Bacon appeared in so frantic and dejected a state of mind that his feUow-prisoners wer: under the strong impression that he intended to make a confession, but the next day he became more composed and has since gained much confidence. He takes much pains to impress on all those about him that he is innocent of the charge alleged against him by his wife, and expresses a strong hope and expectation that at the next examination he will be set at liberty. The wish expressed by Mr. Elliott, at the last examination of the prisoners, of having the body of Mrs. Bacon, sen., exhumed, that it might be submitted to a thorough medical and surgical examination, was forwarded to the authorities at Stamford, but a difficulty appeared to present itself in carrying out the magistraWs wishes in the matter. Mrs. Bacon appears to have been interred in the parish church of Great Casterton, Rutlandshire, and therefore beyond the jurisdiction of the authorities at Stamford. No positive information had yesterday reached Inspector Young or the magistrate, Mr. Elliott, on the subject, but should any seriousdifficulty present itself it is intended at once to apply to the Secretary of State for the HIome Department for an order for the immediate exhumation and examination of the body. In a paragraph which appeared on this subject in this paper on Friday last, it was stated thatk five days before the illness of his mother, and which illness terminated in her death in Seven days, Bacon had purchased an ounce of arsenic at the shop of Mr. Patterson, a druggist in the town of Stamford. In the Starford Alercury of last Friday's date will be found the following confirmation of that fact:-
i' It has been clearly ascertained that. a few days before his mother's death, Bacon purchased half an ounce of arsenic at the shop of Mr. Patterson, druggist, of Red Lionsquare. Ho had previously made attempts to procure arsenic on pretence that he wanted it in his trade, but was unable to do so. When he applied to Mr. Patterson he was told that poison could not be sold without a witness. He then went out, and as Mr. William ulifton, plumber, was passing, he called him in. The arsenic was therefore delivered to him, and an entry of the fact was made in Mr. Patterson's book, which was signed by Bacon and attested by Mr. Clifton. That was on the 8th of May, 1855. On Sunday, the 13th, Bacon'amotherdinedithhim. Onherreturnhome she was taken ill, and on the Tuesday following she died. Nto suspicion as to the real cause of her death was entertamed at the time, but it is said that subsequently Bacon's wife, during her insanity, let fall observations which gave rise to the accusation."

OPPOSITION TO THE INCOME-TAX.
A .0nT
On Friday a publie meeting was held in the Town-hall
Arundel, for the purpose of oon3idering the best modo of procuring a revision or total repeal of the Income-tax.
The mayor, MEr. W. R. Bull, who presided, read a comi-municationreceived from Lord Edward Howard, member for the borough, in which he said, after e.xplaining his inability to attend:-
"Any one would express my sentiments by saying that, while I should regard taxation as a subject not to be dealt with by excitementor haste, se' that I wish much to zee the abolition, if possible, or at least a very great diminution of the Income tax.
" That if we are to have further wars an Income-tax Is necessary
but I trust not to have further war, and I do sincerely hope that we are not going hastily to spend British blood and treasure on Persian soil, which I would fain hope is the only present reason wvhereby the Income-tax shoald be continued at ansthing like its present rate.
" That I :.m not able to say whether the Income-tax iteelf can be immediately or very soon removed a3 a tax, but that the lower It is the better I shall be pleased. That I sympathize much with persens of small incomes, whose comforts and necessities must be so seriously damaged by it. and would do my best to alleviate their sufferiugas soon as is practicable."
The first resolution, moved by Mr. MARSHALL, and seconded by Mr. GAItWooD, and which was carried unanimously, was as follows:-
" That as the Inoome-tax was increased to meet the exigencies of the war, with a di.tinct undesrtauding that it would be abated 12 months after the peace was restored, this meetigs i Of opinion that in good faitb, the additional war tax of Md in the J; ought to oeaw from and after April next"
Other resolutions were agreed to, urging in immediate revision of the tax, and expressing a hope that it might cease in 1860, in conformity with the letter and spirit of the act. The meeting also resolved that Lord Edward Howard should be requested to present a petition to the House of Commons fotnded upon the resolutions.

TO THE BDITOR OF THE TIMEBS.
Sir,-Whatever hesitaticn may have been deferentially entertained by the obscure inmate of Clayhole Manor in offering a warning voice against the threatening extravagancies of dress, there must be none on the part of British ladies to acknowledge their obligation. Putting aside the aUeged synonym of virtue and husbands, or the abuse of the wealthy purse, which in the case alluded to by the "Elderly Gentleman" is, we trust, an exceptional one, it is melancholy to see ladies belying in their attire those virtues and graces which have been ascribed to them alike by the sober pen of the scholar and by the song of the poet, and which receive their attestation and crown in the proverbial happiness of the English home.
There are many points in which we may borrow a lesson from our allies across the Channel, and since proficiency in any art can only be attained at the expense of labour and time, we are generally safe in yielding our allegiance to our more successful rival dressers, and with leniency regard those " lively and graceful follies" which traditionaUy adhere to the Parisian character. But when fashion implies flippancy, and by its extravagance of ornament necessitates immoderate expenditure, we must disown her authority rather than part with our prescriptive character. In every other department of science art receives its highest praise where it aids and perfects nature. Why, then, in the important charge of symbolizing female character is she to reject her supremacy and violate her laws? There is a medium between the apparel wherein
One single pin at night let loose
"The robes which veiled her beauty"
and that of the modern cap -pie beUe. "The globose form stretched inlto longitude" of the modern-hooped petticoat never can approve itself to the delicate eye of good taste. It might be pretty spinning aloft or revolving in airy circles, but in no other medimun; neither can one admire the modern practice of overlaying good material with spangles and meretricious ornaments, bedecking: and bedewing laces and lappets, blondes and ruches, and powdering the head with golddust, as if, to adopt the metaphoric language of barbaric empires, gold really were " tears wept from the sun."
The only occasion in which some excuse may be pleaded for the hooped petticoat is one equally offensive with the hoop itself, and if by your powerful voice it could be banished from our ball-rooms, the reputation of ladies would be benefited-I mean that panse in the third dance of the Lancers in which ladies may often be seen on the verge of a fall, did not either the hoop or the hand of their partner come to their rescue.
Happily for England and the cause of pure classic taste, and all upon which it rests, profuse extravagance and frivolous excess in dress find no shelter in the example of Royalty, as was the case in the age of Louis XV. Amid the necessary transitions of style and various modes of dress, simplicity and propriety of taste are cherished in the circle of British Royalty. They are perfectly compatible with the costliness of array which befits the exalted wearer of Sovereignty, and with the discharge of her pecnliar obligations, and they allow a liberal response to the many cries for employment which ascend from the thousand mills and needy hands of this realm.
I remain, Sir, your obedient servant.

Extraordinary Identification.-On the night
E.XTRAORDINARY IDENIFICATION.-On the night of Saturday, or early on the morning of Sunday last, the house of Major Smith, at Wooderoft, near Partick, was attempted to be broken into by burglars. The thieves contrived to gain access to the house by smashing , pane of glass in one of the room windows, and then removing the snib. A bel attached to the shutter, however, gave the alarm, and the gallant major, hearing the noise, at once sprang from his couch, procured firearms, and soon put the burglars to flight. On examining the window on the following morning the point of a claspknife was found stickingin the wood, which hadbeen broken off in endeavouring to unscrew the snib. The police obtained the broken piece, and carefully preserved it till an owner would cast up. Yesterday Constable 63, of the central division, saw two fellows prowling about his heat, and, not liking their a
pearsace, he marched them off to the office. They gave their names as James MWCabe and Charles Williams, and on searching them a knife was found on M'Cabe with a broken blade, to which the small piece found in the major's window fitted to a nicety. It is needless to say the prisoners were locked up. M'Cabe is a well-knownl housebreaker,-Nortj Britlih Daily AMail,

The Falkland Islands.
THE FALELAND zSzA2iW.D.
TO THEI EDITOR OF TEIE TIMES.
Sir,-I find myself placed in the singular position of an advocate for the Falkhnd Islands, in opposition to the opinion of a former Governor, who, from his long connexion with them, mnst be supposed to take an interest in their welfare.
I cannot dispute the facts with which Governor Rennie has furnished us, but I have the misfortune to differ from him in drawing from some of these facts conclusions the very opposite of those to which they have led him. And I stiUl hold to the belief that the Falklands offer the most eligible site that we possess for a penal colony,-a belief in which I am confirmed by information which Captain Sulivan has kindly proffered me.
Captain Sulivan is the officer to whom we are indebted for the admirable survey of the coasts and harbours of those islands, and a residence there of three years with his family renders him a most compatent witness; his; testimony is very favourable, and I could only wish that he would be induced publicly to advocate this cause himself. The point in Mr. Rennie's letter to which I wish particularly to caU attention is the enormous price of labour at the Falklands. He says,-" Notwithstanding the high w ges procurable by artisans and labourers, the former, if shipwrights, earning sometimes four or five dollars per diem, the latter from 4s. to 6s., few of them remain permanently, and the smaU population is kept up chiefly by fresh arrivals." Now, this is the very measure of the need and of the value of a convict population. A com. mon labourer is worth there from 4s. to 6s. per diem, and a skilled labourer from 16s. to 20s.; let it be granted that corn must be imported to support the convicts, that therefore their maintenance would be somewhat more expensive than in this country, yet how vastly greater wcoud be the value of their earnings ! Nor is this all. If the Falklands, in spite of these high wages, are so unattractive as not to be able to detain and fix their free population, and are depen. dent on constant fresh arrivals, is it not to be seriously apprehended that under the present concurrent circumstances of a slacker emigration, and tho diversion of such as exists to more inviting regions, the supply of labour there wril positively decline, and that in the face of a constantly increasing demand for it? If the maintenance of a refitting yard at the Falklands is of paramount importance, as seems to be on all hands admitted, it surely is the duty of Government not to leave its existence dependent on the fortuitous arrival of emigrants, but to provide systematically for its support. If this were done, it would soon bscome known throughout the British empire that every facility for refitting and revictuaUing might be depended on, whereas I confidently assert that when I was at Melbourne last year this fact was not generally known there. Mr. Rennie thinks that the presence of convicts would deter ships from touching, "except under circumstances of real distress, as the freedom and healthy recreation of the crews and passengers would be seriously interfered with for the necessary security of the convicts." I have visited several penal colonies, and have never known such restrictions to exist, nor are they required, free inter. course of ships with the shore being found to be perfectly compatible with the safe custody of convicts. Mr. Rennie says that engagement in the fisheries " is an employment unsuited to prisoners." In mentioning these fisheries I, of course, only contemplated them as a resource for the emancipated class; if this class chose to leave the islands, as undoubtedly many of them w,ould, it would be to scatter tbemselves over the world, some, of course, to return to England. This we cannot avoid, send them where we may; but the same miasma which when concentrated, as it now is in England, is in the highest degree pestilential and reproductive, dispersed and ventilated becomes innoxious. But MrRennie writes as if the resources of the Falklands were already developed to the utmost; why, Sir, one half of the territory, and that the most productive, is wholly unocCUpied, untenanted by man or beast. The West Falkland, with its islands, is still covered with large patches of the tussock grass, so valuable for winter feed, which has almost disappeared from the east island, having been destroyed by the cattle from want of due protection. A large part of this island is described as a fine valey, weU watered by a river which is navigable for eight miles. It is eapable, as Captain Sulivan informs me, of running 100,000 head of eatta.
Here is a magnificent expanse for cattle stations; let them be offered to squatters on easy terms, saddled with the condition of receiving a large proportion of assigned servants, who would be useful in fencing in the patches of tussock grass for winter feed. I find that in my former letter I have greatly underrated the area of the group, which CaDtain Sulivan estimates at 2,500,000 acres, at least 2,000, 000 acres being fit for grazing purposes. But in the Gazcxtr of the World I find it given at 6,000 square miles, which makes 3,840,000 acres, and this large territory is at present occupied by merely a few hundred artisans and labourers. Captain Sulivan is so sanguine as to believe it eapable of supporting at least6O0,000 persons. Nor is it only in understating their extent that I have done injustice to them; I failed to mention one most important product-coalis found there, as well asstone andslate, fit for building purposes. If poultry cannot be profitably raised, geese, swans, and ducks, abound-no bad substitutes for the supply of shipping. The flock of Cheviots belonging to the FaLkland Islands Company are found to do well; and one great advantage of sheep is this, that they rapidly improve a barren soil, and if, as is said, turnips can be grown, this improvement will be so much the more rapid.
I cannot help thinking that persevering as were Mr. Renrie's endeavours to wring produce from a stubborn soil they must necessarily have been confined to one limited district. The neighbourhood of the settlement and the site of the settlement being undoubtedly fixed on for its maritime advantages, itby no means follows that is the best for agricultural purposes; how else are we to account for the fact that the settlers during the last five years of Mr. Rennie's administration " were enabled to supply ships with 'vegetables,' as weU as occasionally fish, and provisions of every sort?" Vegetables, then, they do raise for their own consumption and to spare. There is one great source of manure which I have not seen mentioned, more valuable for a peaty soil than " guano," or even "blood ;" it is the kelp with which the coast abounds. Any one who knows the Channel Islands must acknowledge the astonishing effect produced in Guernsey on land reclaimed from the sea by the dried "vraic" or "sea wrack." Lime, where it ean be procured, or a vegetable alkali, such as the ashes of this weed afford, are the proper correctives of the sour principle in peat, while such strong stimulants as "guano and blood," when introduced into a soil with which they cannot amalgamate destroy the seed. Fish, too, are "occasionally supplied." Fish of a large size absolutely swarm around the coasts. Captain Sulivan caught five tons the first time he sent out the nets. Now, when we consider that South America is fiUed with a Roman Catholic population, among whom restriction to a fish diet during Lent is one of the most rigidly observed rules of life, can we avoid the conclusion that these fisheries are a most important interest?
Xt Louis Vernet, a 13 years resident on the islands, one of many writers who since my letter appeared have volunteered to give me all the information in their power, assures me that he sent several cargoes thence to Rio, which sold at a great profit. Have then, I ask, the resources of these islands been as yet fairly explored, or are they only in slow process of developement ? They have been hitherto occupied only by a mere handful of pensioners and a few free settlers, who find such profitable employment about the settlement that they have but little inducement to work the land. Can there be a more signal instance of the want of energygof military pensioners than the faet mentioned by Mr. Rennie, thab the party sent to the Falklands could not be induced to put a spade into the ground " until they saw, some months afterwards, a crop of very tolerable potatoes dug in the governor's garden 7" That is, they lost one entire season, because no assurances would persuade them that potatoes would grow.
I yield to Mr. Rennie's opinion that " a population would not succeed in maintaining itself by agriculture p bu'
whnre do you find a population supported by agriculture alone? I have mentioned the Channel Islands; I wil again refer to them as offering a close and curious analogy, There you have a population of about 1,500 tothe square mile, living in great comfort, on what? Clearly not on the land alone, but on that in conjunction with the various resources of fishing, of ship-building, and the production of articles of domestic manufacture, Guernseys and Jerseys, which they barter for fish on the banks of Newfoundland.
Are not precisely similar resources open to the Falklanders ?
But were the advantages presented by these islands less than I believe them to be, were there no prospect of the
absorption of convicts there after their emancipation, I should stil advocate the sending thither of a sufficient number for the erection of such works as would give additional facilties to shipping and for insuring an adequate supply of labour. That region has become of late years,. in consequence of the disovery of Californian
and Australian gold, one of the great highways of commerce; it is girt for many hundred leagues by barren and inhospitable coasts, and is so wiad and stormy that no mariner approaches it without misgiving. In this region we possess the most secure harbours of refuge that can be wished for; surely, then, both our owu interests and the just expectations of other nations should induce us to form there an establishment adequate to all emergencies.
That such an establishment does not exist at present, whatever may have been the case in Mr. Rennie's tme,
I take for granted, from the tenour of Mr. Snowrs letter (of the 23d) and from the impossibility under the present
=A,g=vnlta .f axCurng 4 sssficivn# supply £f labour,
That it can be formed with great advantage to ourselves, as 'well as to the general interests of commerce, I think ig also clear. And, lastly, it seems we are invited to this disposal of our prison labouLr by the unanimous wishes of the colonists, of the prent Governor, of the Falkland Island Company, and of persons interested in commerce. Is there any other part of the world that offers so many and such weighty inducemoents?
I am, Sir, your obedient servant.
C. W. EDDY,

Regworth, Jan. 24. Uxford, Eadeliffe Traveling FeUow.
TO THE EDlIOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I have with considerable interest read Mr. Eddy's letter in The Times of the 21st inst., respecting the Falkland Islands as a proposed penal settlement, and I am glad to find that you give the weight of your influence to the consideration of a scheme which promises wel for both England and her small dependency, which hitherto has been but a useless medium for the expenditure of some 4,K000. or 5,0004 per annum.
The Falkland Islandg are essentiaUy a colony the pros. perity of which depends for the full developement of its resources upon labour, and this, it would seem to me, makes it particularly suitable as a settlement for convicts, whose subsstence and comfort would in a great measure depend upon their own exertions. We surely are not called upon to keep our criminals in luxurious idleness. The climate admirable seconds this necessity for labour, by being such as renders a brgoge amount of exertion rather exhilarating than exhaustirg.
The natural productions are few, the artificial may be many, and of that class which would most contribute to render such a colony self-supporting.
The position of these islands in a commercial point of view cannot be too highly rated. Placed by nature in the great highway from Australia, and to and from the west coast of America, they require hut the impetus and importance that would be given to them by a Government undertaking of the proposed nature to be placed at once upon their proper footing. At present, notwithstanding the excellent Admiralty charts published, the magnificent and safe harbounrs with which the islands abound, and the facilities for obtaining refreshment and repairs which, even in its present infant state, the colonyaffords, sailors approach with fear and trembling, often ignorant of the existence of a settlement, oftener of its situation. Many vessels, battered off Cape Horn, bear up for the River Plate or Rio Janeiro, ignorant of or doubtful about the desired haven lying close under their lee.
I will now take a eursory glance at the natural capabilities of the FalUdands as a means for giving profitable employment to a labouring population. My opinions are founded upon the experiences of a residence of nearly four years, during which time I was actively engaged in business which made me intimately acquainted with the whole of the East Falldand, especiallv as regards pastoral pursuits. The climate, as is well known, is remarkably healthy, and suited to the English constitution; exposure to all weathers seems to be borne without a retributive rheumatism.
The winters are about as cold as those in England, the summer cooler than ours aud very boisterous. The constant wind, combined with want of heat, would be an obstacle, except in a few favoured spots, to the growing and ripening of grain crops. Vegetables and roots, especially turnips, even in the present rude state of agriculture and the exceedingly unfavourable situation of the settlement as regards quality of land, do very welL
But the great riches of the islands would be reaped from a combined pastoral and agricultural system of farming. Cattle are abundant, and by a judicious system of management, which in the present scarcity and dearness of labour is not practicable, might be made a source of large profit. Sheep have been introduced, and the climate and pasture are well adapted for them-I may mention the Cheviot breed as particularly suitable, those imported a few years ago having increased rapidly, and the quality rather improving than deteriorating. The complete absence of burr, or any substance injurious to the fleece, is an important fact in a wool-growing country, which this wiU eventually become. Here, again, cheap labour is indispensable, and might be advantageously employed in fencing, draining, raising winter food, &c.; for neither country ror climate, be it remembered, is suited to the primitive and unlaborious methods of stock-farming practised in Australia and the River Plate. Disease is scareely known among any description of stock. Horses thrive well.
Stone for fencing and building purposeS is obtainable with little labour ablost everywhere, and is of excellent quality. There is no clearing required, as the land is free from wood, and lies wholly in pasture.
The facilities for making large enclosures for farming purposes are great, as the island in cut up into various sized peninsulas by the numerous inlets. Among minor comforts I may mention the complete absence of aU noxious insects and reptiles.
The tussock grass (indigenous, I believe, to these islands) is an important production. Its fattening qualities for all sorts of stock are very great. It is perennial, green and growing in winter as weU as summer. It flourishes wel in any situation, on any soil; it may be cut, after about eight inches growth, certainly twice, perhaps thrice a-year, and it improves with cutting. Enclosed plantations of tussock might easily be made, as the ground would not require any preparation; they would require a few years to arrive at a state of perfection, but would then prove an inexhaustible and invaluable resource.
Mr. Eddy mentions the whale and seal fisheries. At certain seasons immense quantities of large muUet may be caught in the tidal creeks. These fish salt and dry well, and always find a ready market in Brazil, whence rnight be imported timber and provisions, as sugar, coffee, &c.
The construction of a patent slip, dry dock, roads, and the various Government and dockyard works, would give constant employment to a number of convicts who might require to be kept under particular surveiUance.
West Falkland, which I believe to be the finer of the two principal islands, is uninsabited; and these natural divisions of land may be made available for the complete subdivision and classification of convicts, if required.
In addition to the mere fresh food supplied to shipping, a preserved meat trade might be carried on, probably for export as weU as local supply. The climate is very favourable for salting, and there is no reason why mess beef and pork (under the farming system I mention) should not make a valuable article of commerce. Hides and wool have always a certain and ready market in England.
For detailed information on all subjects connected with the Falklands I would direct your attention to Captain Fitzroy's surveying voyages and to a pamphlet published in 1843 by the Land and Emigration Commissioners, on information furnished to them by the then Governor Moody.
I have omitted to mention peat, which is excellent and plentiful and might become an article of commerce.
Mr. Eddy mentions peculiar privileges having been granted to the Patagonian Mission; surely this is an error; the FaLkland Island Company must be meant.
It is hardly fair of hr. Elliot to cite the example of a few nearly worn-out military pensioners as a specimen of what mayor can be done in agriculture. The settlement of Stanley is most unfavourably placed, except as regards the barbour, the land about it being principaly peat bog, and, as Mfr. Eddy observes, old soldiers are not likely to make enterprising farmers.
In conclnsion, let me express a hope that the time will soon come when the Falklands wil serve some better purpose than that of furnishing a bone of contention to economicaUy minded M.P.'s, who annuaLUy complain of wasteful expenditure in keepingup a useless colony.
I am, ir, your obedient servant.

SHIPWRBEKS.
TO TEiE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-As it has been well said The Times is everywhere, you will no doubt be acquainted with the operations of this society on the coast, and as you are forward, Sir, to promote objects of general and national importance, I venture to call your attention to an appeal of this society, in your advertising columns, for help to meet the distress arising from the late awful gales on our shores, and especially on the east coast. It is melancholy to observe the loss of life that is there represented by the number of widows and orphans relieved, yet it may well be supposed that this represents but a small proportion of those who actually suffered, as doubtless the geater number drowned would be unmarried. But it is still more melancholy, Sir, to reflect that the greater part of the loss of life and property might have been preserved had there been harbours of refuge existing for which vessels could run in times of need.
This subject surely is one of urent nsional importance 6,185 persons were last year relieved by this institution, among whom were 2,542 widows and orphans, at least; in all human probability, the half of the sufferers might have been spared had they had a safe port to run for. As it is there isno place but the Humber betwceen Great Yarmouth and the Firth of Forth; and our unfortunate seamen caught in the gale on the shore have no choice between foundering at sea or giving themselves a bare chance for their lives by beachingtheir vessels.
Your powerful pen might avail much towards providing a remedy for this great evil, or at least in stirring up tho dormant energies of those who may have the matter in hand, and estpecially the cornmissioners for forming a harbour of refnee at Hartlepool, for which there has been an act of Parhiament passed since 185S. Apologizing for the length of this, hut hoping for your excuse from the importance of the subject,

OMNIBUSES V. RAILWAYS.-The Manchester City
OM1NIBUSSS V. RAILWAYS.- The Manchester City OmnibusCompany started a line of eighto ainibusesbetween that city and Stockport yesterday, to run daily in competition with the London and North-Western Railway. The speculation has been under consideration before; but the immediate cause of the present undertaking is an attempt made thisyear by the raUiway co pany to compel the holders of contract tickets to gea into and leave the carriages only at the termini specified in their contracts. litherto a contractor, paying thO whole distance between the two towns, held himself at libertv to get up or down at any intermediate stopping station. The omnibuses are handsome, spacious, and comfortable, the inside being equal to most first-class railway accommodation, while the fare is only twothirds,the omnibus fare insido being 6d.forthe six miles, while the charge by railway, first-class, is 9d. The second-class railway is 6d., and third-class 4d., while the onmibus outside fare is 4d. The railway transit is much mora rapid, but, as the stations in both towns are some distance from the centres of business, the omnibuses have an advantage by running to those points which gives them nearly an equality in point of time. The omnibusses are drawn by three horses abreast, but it is probable that if the loads are heavy four horres will be used, as in the old coaches,
FALL OF A RAILwAY BBiDGE.-The traffic of the line of railway between Coventry and Nuneaton (a branch of the London and North-Western) was yesterday morning about 9 o'clook for a time completely stopped by the falling_ in of a viaduct at Cowden, a short distance from Coventry. The line from the latter city communicates direct from Leamington with Tamworth, Derby, and the north. The bridge which is of several arches, Is of stone, and carries over tne rails a very important old turnpike road of the district; but, fortunately, at the time the accident occurred, owing to the absence of traffic, not the slightest injury befell either the road or railway travellers. A. train had passed under the bridge only a short time before, bat, beside the damage sustained by the railway company and the detention of trains, no injury was sustainied by any individuals. Pas-
engers to the NTorth from Coventry were conveyed beyonc the dilapidated bridge by omnribuses, and considerable pergonal inconvefiences weroe thoOnlY un.pleasant results comVained of. The engineers of the 'London and North~Vestemn Company were speedily on the spt n teln
was as speedilPy as po,eieplery °On pthe ot, and the line
wasas peeilyas osible cleared of the ddu.is. The cause
of the accident has not been clearly ascertained.
TalE DERBYSniUR RURAL PoLcIE.-The new ruraT. police force for Derbyshire is to be thus constituted :-A chief constable (Mr. Fox), with a salary of 4001, a-year, and 1001. a-year travelling expenses; 1 fist-class superinten-
dent, at 1401. a-year; 3 superintendents at 1201t a-yeareach; 4 superintendents at 1001. a-year each, with an allowance of 401. a-year each for travelling expenses; 5 first-class aergeants, at 23s. per week; 9 second-class sergeants, at 20s. per week; 60 first-clss' constables, at 19s. per week; 73 second-class constable, At 17s.,;r week {the constables to have sn aUlowance for clothin y;&ls0 a clerk and storekeeper, with a salary of 90g. r annum.
