I]R JOHN PAKINGTON's BILL.-At a MEET. I. N fteWesley an Committee of Education, held at the COo. tes = -hll.Lodon, on Friday, Feb. 27, 1057, the Rev. ROBERT TOILNG, President of the Conference, In ths chair, to conisider the vrovitleus of " A Bill to promote Education In CorPcrate Cities anid
Borw,*h in. EsglarLd aL.d Wales," brouglht into the Houeo of Comrmons by Sir Johni Pakinigton, and to he read a second time on Wednesdlay next:
Afrer lengthened deliberation, the Comamittee resolved as follows
1. Th'at this Protestantb nation, professing so it does to bars Its religion uoen the Bible, and its legislation and jurisprodence upon Christianity, end professing also to deriv-e its morals as wrell as itin religio,n from that source, has hitherto, in conoistenry with this flast
princp!e of civil polity ona religion, made the daily reading of the Hlol' Scriptures, in Protestant echeols, an siodispeDnoble condition of reeo ving aid from the pulri: funds, hot this committee finds, writh doorp reeret, that in the bili nowe before Parliamenjt this Princigle is aban~doned,rio teaching of religion or morals isr iie;ado 0
whicir are to supply a complete education to lbsechildren of the poor, and on this grouLd are in he maintained by a tos, on all classes 01 the con,muLity. may leav,e thom is litter ignorance of that Divine RBore lation which AlmightY God bar given to enlighten menx's minds, purify
their affeactions, and reguatle t sir coniduct, and by wWollu He wdli
judgr, all mnen at the lost day.
2. h' hiei a ever been the fixed role in WealoYan schools, duMrbie tieleau'hoinof the Catechism, to perrmit the absence of any child whose parersts should object to his being taught such formvulary, and to lease ott children free to attend, on the Sabbath, whatever Suindry School and VI co of worship their parents miay prefer, this Commuites believes that the Weeleyall communit,y wilt never coirlutn that the teaching of relirion lteelf ink their schools ehbll be subj'eot to reatrIction. Their experience choirs that, besides the Sort ptore lesson with xvivich their reaoots daily opn, and in which It is sooght to make Divine troth inteliigible in chirlden of all calaitaeise, an able Christian toacber will fi,d throughaoutthe doy'. when teavhbinggec.grapby history,
b)Ialnd moral science, sod the knowl.dge of commonthings, Frqet"aion to illustrate and enforce the truths of religion' anid that religious teaching moay be made to impart life and spirit tor the who!e premos 01 education.
S. Teat, though It Is provided by this Bil that "no Inspector shall inqietre into or relore upon any religious JInstroction, Which shall he give n in sany school vrhich he maay inspect." yet, considering the c3na. premife which thegroposerof this measure professes to have made with a ponty which ha itberto strenuously conitended fee the exclusion of all religious leaching from puhirc schools, this Committee cannot but apprehend, that the clause rcquirinjg the appointment of sooEt time for the teaching of " any distinctive reli"ions formulairy" wvill, in manymease, be construed to mean, that t')e doctrines s-et forth In such forrul'amy shall in no formn whatever he taught but at these set timnes;and even a conscicentious teacher may rot vrsreasonably questionl Whc.rher it WaS Lot initended, by such compromise, to in restrict the teathirveof religioni.
4. That thIs Commnittee, therefore, strongly urge upon Parliament, that if, so proposed, the explenwoof educatjing the children of the poorer classes must be thrown upon the poor-rate, and munmicipal romemitteve must determaine the aid which each school shall receive, the law which Onscts this aroaigement should explicity in'e-ryret what In reoat by religious for mulsry; and should tur-her declare, that the mianagers of schbools, with the execDtion Of such formolary 'are as free to teach religion, at any timie and in any manner which they deem best,Iin their schools, as any other branch of k-nowledge.
5. That this C-ommittee, however, beoeby exPresres its earnesat wish that this hilt may uot pusoltito a law, as, in its opinion, it would not advance but injure the campe of popular eduication. It makes nO provision; for new schcols In poor a-nd neceesitaus diatricts, and thus leaves the metat want which all edmit, to"al unrelieved. Besides the objection stated in the first of there resolutions, and which this Committee hot es the0 Logiolature will hold to be decisive, wherever the maeasure is adopted, it weill Isopemede voluntar contributionis for the support of schcol,, and deprive themn in the end of the vluntary management for which nio adequnte ol,h3titutacar, be found; anId, in the judgment of this Comnmittee, the present system of assisting the poor but industziotis classes to educuste their childxen, byI the opontantotus sympathy anid liberality of their more affluent neighbours, most have an incomparabrlF superior mnorsl and sEOcal influenCe UPOn the minds both of the 'parents and children so assisted, than can over arise when that assistance has been pauperized, by deriving It fromn the parish poorrate.

PARLIAMENTARY INTELLIGENCE.
HOUSE OF LORDS, TUTSDAY, MARCH 3.
Their lordships met at 5 o'clock.
TheEarlof HARD WICKE presented a petition fTom Mr. Dillon, who drove an American smuggler, the Peru, into the harbour of Kinsale in the year 1822, whereby she was captured. The petition stated that the value of the vessel
was 60,00l., but that he had received no remuneration for 1 her capture, and praying that he might be de,lared entitled to a share of the prize money.
Lord PA?TMURE said the claim of Mr. Dillon had very often been discussed in the other House, but always with the same result.
Petitions wvere presentedby the Earl of SirsrTsmusuy, against the opium traffic, from the FreeParish Church in kotbesay;* from the Free Clmrch Wesleyan congregation at AshEord; also from Mtr. Gillespie, praying thaG uo measure be pased to strip the schoolmaster of his Christian character.
TESTAMlENTARY JURISDICTIOiN BILL.
The LORD CHANCELLOR said that he should move on Thursday that this Bill be commnitted pro foarrl, in order that it might be printed, with some valuable suggestions made by his noble and learned friend (Lord St. Leonard's, as we understood).
DIVORCE AND IMTRMI1ION[AL CAUSES
BILL.
The LORD CHANCELLOR.-I rise to ask your lord. ships to agree to the second reading of the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Bill. My lords, with two variations, this BiU is substantially the same as the Bill which was introduced into this House last session. Your lordships vill recollect that some years ago a Royal commission was issued directing the Lord Chief Justice, Mr. Walpole, my noble and learned friend near me (Lord Redesdale), and one or two other commissioners to inquire into the existing law of divorce, with a view of seeing whether any suggestions coald be made enabling the Legislature to get rid of the anomaly of those private Acts of :Parliament which during the last century or century and a half in casesF,+here adultery had been committed were conceded as matters of course to persons who asked for them at your lordships' bar. The matter having been referred to the commissioners, they recommended that the practice of passing Acts of Parliament granting divorce a vinculo matrimcnii should be abolished, and that in lieu thereof a court should be constituted having the power, where the cir. cumstances were proved which were essential for obtaining a divorce before your lordships' House, to grant a divorce * vinculo matrimonii. In pursuance of that recommenda. tion I had the honour to introduce a Bill into your lordships' House which, after reading a second time, your lordships were pleased to refer to a select committee. We availed ourselves of the assistance of more than one right rev. prelate and several of your lordships who took deep interest in the subject. I believe all the law lords were members of the coinmittee, though, in truth, the question was no more a question for lawyers than for laymen, being an important alteration in the social habits of the people, and not strictly coming under the head of law reform. My noble and learned friend (Lord Lyndhurst) made in the committee a motion for extending the provisions of the bill so as to give relief to married persons who were not separated by divorce a vinculo matrimon4i, but were separated by;divorce a mensd ei thoro. Accordingly, clauses were introduced enabling married women separated by decree of the ecclesiastical courts, but not a vinculo maatri-monii, to gain the privileges of single persons as to property, so as to prevent the possibility of their husbands returning and depriving them of the fruits of their industry. Those clauses were discussed, eventually adopted by the committee, recommended to the Eou.e, and adopted by the House on their recommendation. By the bill thus adopted a court was constituted consisting of the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chiei Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench, the Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, and the judge of the Court of Probate. The judge of the Probate Court for all purposes except the important one of a divorce a vinculo matrisnonit had full power without the concurrence of the other judges, but for the purpose of granting a divorce a vinculo manri-monii tbh concurrence of three of the judges was necessary, one of the three being the ecclesiastical judge. The course of proceedings was to be by the examination of witnesses wt2d roce, with power of sending issues, if thought necessary, to be tried by a court of law. That was the outline of the Bill then, and with the exception of substituting the Dean of the Arches for the judge of the Probate Court, that is the outline of the Bil now. The BiUs are substantiaUy the same, with two trifling exceptions. After the Bill came from the select committee the Bishop of Oxford moved the insertion of a proviso that in the case of a divorce a tinculo mtatrimon ii, although the parties would be at liberty to marry again, the adulterer should notbeable to marry the adulteress. Your lordships carried that proviso, I was going to say by acclamation. I protested against it, but, with that objectionable proviso, the Bill passed to the House of Commons. As I am responsible for introducing the change of the law in the best mode, have thought proper to omit that proviso, leaving it to your lordships to re-insert it, if I do sot convince you that it is most objectionable. I say it is most objectionable, because it inflicts a most cruel punishment on the woman, and in nine cases out of 10 is a great gain to the adulterer. I believe that in the ordinary case of divorce foUowing adultery the man, if ho be possessed of any sentiment of honour, feels bound to make aU the reparation inhis power by marrying the woman whom he has excluded from society. I am afraid men will be no less inclined to commit adultery when they feel themselves relieved from that great embarrassment by the law actually preventing them making the reparation. Your lordships are aware that in the Acts privately dissolving marriage it has been the practice to in'troduce such a proviso, knowing that, as a matter of course, it will be struck out by the other House, and such Bills never couie back without the proviso being struck out. What reason, then, have you for supposing that a different course will be adopted -with regard to a general than is always adopted with regard to a particlular Divorce Bill ? And if that be so, I do not see the use of attempting to introduce a clause which is sure not to meet with approval in another placo, unless you are prepared to make its insertion a condition to the passing of any measure upon the subject. The other change in the BiM I have introduced, hoping that your lordshi'es will think it founded on good sense. It is a clause by which separation deeds are legalized by positive onactment. It is too late to speculate whether it is desirable for married persons to separate, and as far as they can to remove the obligations and restraints of marriage. These separation deeds have been prevalent for more than half a century, and their validity has ultimately come to be established in courts of law and equity. Even in a case in your lordsliips' House, when Lord Cottenham was Chancellor, your lordships supported an injunction restraining parties to such a deed fromu taking any proceedings in the ecclesiastical courts. I ain aware that would not be affirmed in the case of a simple deed in which the parties declare they intend to separate, but is not that a matter of form? I know the Lord Chief Justice said it was now done through the instrumentality of friends and trustees, but if husband and wife wish to separate is there any difficulty in getting persons to act as trustres? It is substantiaily an agreementbetween husband and wife, though it is effected by somne person on behalf of the wife covenanting not to molest the husband, and to bear him harmless against her debts, and by some person on behalf of the husband covenanting to protect the wife against any interference on his part. What I propose is that without this complicated machinery it shall be lawful for per. sons to make such a deed, to register it in the court, and to give it all the effect which the courts of law now give to it. Of course, it will be for your lordships to say whether you will adopt that view or not; but it appears to me that, according to the old proverb, if you cannot get people to conform to the law you had better make the law conform to usage. Courts of law and ciluity have recognized the binding validity of these deeds, and that being so I cannot see the objection to get rid of all complication about them. These are the only two alterations which I have introduced into the bill which passed your lordships' Eouse last session and, having stated shortly wh.t those alterations are, I shall content myself by moving your lordsliips to give a second reading to the BilL
Lord LYNDIIHURST.-I should not have thought it right to ,ddress your lordships at this stage, but in consequence of the part which I took in the progress of the Bill that was lost from being sent down too late to the Houso of Commons last session, I have received so many communications from persons for whose opinions I entertain great respectEo many communications of objections to the Bill, as violating the principles of morality and religion, that I think I ought not to give altogether a silent vote. I am surprised at what I consider this change of opinion, for I am per suaded it is a change of opinion since the Bill passed this House in the last session of Parliament. I am at a loss to account for tllis, except by attributing it to what fell from a right rev. prolate (the Bishop of Oxford) upon the last occasion of this subject being discussed That right rev. prelate dealt with the question with all the eloquence and ability which he brings to bear upon evely
matter, but at the same time he stated a circumstaneo which I am afraid has had considerable effect upon persons whose attention has been directed to this subject. The right rev. prelate stated that one of the most eminent fathers of the church, St. Augustine, after considering the question during tho greater :tt of his life and upon repeated occasions, had been unable to rmake up his mind as to the pro. priety of allowing divorces. In consequenoe of that statemeni I have felt it my duty to look into the voluminous writings of St. Augustine, and I confess I have been struck with the singular subtlety displayed and the talent for drawing nice distinctions, although it appears to me that that distinguished divine was niore skldful in creating difficulties than in discovering methods of removing them. In his commes ts upon the passage in St. Matthew in the sermon on tht Mount, in which our Saviour alludes to the subject of Adultery, he says great discussions have arisen as tb the meaning of that passage-whether it is to be taken in the enlarged sense sometimes used in Scripture as meauing any unlawful desires or worldly views, or in a more limited sense. At least, however, ho comes to a conclusion which is directly in support of the present measure, The passage to wbich I refer is this,-
" -But that it is lawful to de.9misg a wife for that which in xtups-ie committitur does not admit of a doubt."
He repeats this over and over again in the course of
his work. In one case he says that this is the sole esceotion which our Lord makes when speaking of the dismissal of a wife, and heleavesit to be understood that the same rule applies to the husband, since not only, he aays, has the woman no power over her person but the husband, 'but also the husband has no power over his person but the wife. And in ilustration of what I have stated as to the character of this learned divine, I wil refer you to a short anecdote which he mentions in commenting upon the word, I bave just quoted :-A man was tbrown into npson in Autioch for not paying his taxes, and was threatened with death unless those taxes were paid by a certain time. This eireumstance became known throughout the city, and a certain wealthy man proposed to the prisoner's wife (who happened to he an exceedingly handsome woman) that if she would pass one night with him he would pay the amount for her husband. The woman hesitated for some time, and then consulted her husband, who advised her to accept the offer. She performed her part of the contract
and the wealthy man performed in a certain manner his part of the contract. The question then arises, says the learned divine, was this adultery or not-referring to the passage that the woman has no power over her person but her husband, nor the husband any power over his person but the wife" He asks whether,the husband having given license to the wife, she had committed adultery, andto show the refinement of that learned divinehe, after much consideration, says he gives no opinion upon the matter. In the anecdote I have mentioned the wealthy man behaved in a scandalous manner, for, instead of givnmg the wife the money he had promised, he gave her a charge upon his land, which had it not been for tho interposition of the governor would not have been paid. The learned divine then treats of the other question, as to the right of persons divorced to marry again. He says adultery is a ground of divorce according to the passage I have quoted; but upon the subject of remarriage he entertains great doubt. It was to this, I presume, the right rev. prelate alluded when he said that that eminent divine, after spending many years in considering the question, had not come to any certain conclusion, foron lookiing through his voluminous writings I can find no decisive opinion. So much for St. Augustine. But, supposing he was entitled to more authority than ho has actually a right to claim, the authorities on the other side are overwhelming. I do not pretend to have consulted them myself, but they were all stated by a learned divine in this House about 150 years ago in the case of Lord Rosso's BilL That prelate, the Bishop of Durham, in the statement which he made, and which is in print, observes that opposite conclusions to those of St. Augustine have been arrived at by numerous councils, by most eminent fathers of the church, by most learned Catholics, such as Erasmus and others; by the most eminent Protestants, Grotius, Solden, and others ; by all the Greek church, and by that distinguished body of persons, clergy and laity, who were appointed to revise the canon law in the reign of Edward VI. ; and the only supprt of the Roman Catholic view was the Council of Trent. We all know that council was held with a view to increase the power of the church at the expense of the Catholic religion, and it has never been regarded by us as any authority. If the right rev. prelate opposite (the Bishop of Exeter) should take any part in this discussion, I would remind him that for 150 years biUs of divorce have been continually granted, and in only one or two instances had there been any oppostion raised by any member upon the right rev. bench. I am satisfied that no effective opposition can be raised to the principle of this measure. There is, however, another class of objections which I have heard raised. Noble and learned lords have told us they think it would be better to adhere to our present praotice, and continue the present exceptional course. I should much like to hear the arguments which are supposed to support such a view. Practically, divorces have been granted during the last 150 years. It is quite certain that any person introducing a biU complaining of his wife's adultery, and showing that he has conducted himself with propriety, will succeed in his application. It may be said, if that is the effect of the present practico why should any change be made? My lords, the answer is obvious. The present practice is an injustice, because its benefits are connmed to a limited class. (Hear, bear.) No person of moderate income can bear the expenses of an application to Parliament for a divorce, and therefore it is a real injustice to deny to one clas that which is conceded to persons of
more ample means. Then, again, it is asked, what will you I do with the poorer classes? It does not follow, because my noble and learned friend proposes to establish a tribunal of this kind, composed of persons in a high station, that the expenses attending it should be exceedingly great, and I have no doubt that such a tribunal would make regulations to enable all classes to have recourse to it. I have heard it said that this would be prodductive of immorality; but I come to a contrary oonelusion. If you give no remedy in such cases to the humbler orders of the commuinity what does it lead to? sWhy, to acts of brutal violence and indifference. What can be more fatal to the morality of a district than the allowed continuation of adultery without any means of redress? The remedy in Scotland extends to the lower orders, and it has produced no ill effects in that country. Why thould we think that it would produce a disregard of principle and morality in this part or the kingdomn When the former Bill was before a committee I took occasion to say that, as in Scotland the law was equallyapplicable to thehusband and wife, I thought there was no reason why a similar rule should not be adopted in this country. I was fortified in that opinion by a reference to the Reformatio Zegum, in which adultery by the 'wife and the husband is put precisely on the same ground. But the committee was averse to my position, and therefore I abandoned the point for a time. But there is another alteration to this Billwhich I am most anxious to see introduced. I think there are four cases of adulterv by the husband in which a divorce can be obtained. I wish to add a filfth. I think where a husband after a certain number of years abandons his wife and goes to a distant eountry with the view to desert her, that is a case in which a divorce should lie. Reflect, my lords, for a moment on the objects of marriage. Look at the marriane ceremony of our church. Three objects are there statedfirst, the procreation of children and their nurture in the fear of God; secondly, the prevention of sin; and, thirdly, the love, comfort, and protection, in sickness and in health, between the husband and the wife. What is the vow taken by the husband in the ceremony of marriage ? Nothing can be more stringent. He vows he will love, comfort, keep, and protect his wife, in sickness and in health, and, forsaking ml other women, keep only to her until death do them part. That is as strong an obligation as can be incurred under the circumstances, and one which must affect in the most powerful manner ainy man with the least degree of feeling. But, in spite of this obligation, we find men, disregarding all the duties which it imposes on them -all these three objects of marriage-abandoning their wives and going to distant countries with the view of putting an end to all communication with them. Can we say, under such circumstances, that the wife should be tied to a man who has so cruelly deserted her and her children ? Is there any justice in such a system? Since this matter was brought underthe consideration of your lordships' House I have received letters from many unfortunate women in this situation, and I cannot describe to you how the painful recitals they have given of their utter wretchedness hiave wrung my heart. -My lords, the first object with a woman in early life is a miatrimonial union, on which she builds all her prospects of future happiness. When she selects the object of her affection she gives up to him her person, her property, anid all her hopes of future good. Itoften bappeus after this that she wakes up as if it were from a drearn, and finds herself abandoned and deserted by the faithless object of her love. She sees nothing before her but a long, dreary lIfe, without any object on which she can repose her affections-
"Where no hope comes that comes to all."
Possessed, on the other hand, of a warm heart, a generous spirit, and a confiding temper, she meets with some cowardly seducer, sinks into sin, and ends her life in misery and wretchedness. I most earnestly implore your lordships to consider this state of the law. 'We are here not to protect our own sex alone, but we are stil more called on to protect those who bave no means of protecting themselves. Why, I repeat, should the law in this respect be so different between the two parts of the united kingdoni 9 Why should Scotland be just and generous, and England remain barbarous ? I make these observations, my lords, in the present stage of this Bill in order to give your lordships an opportunity of reflecting on the justice of this claim, and t e more you reflect upon it I am sure you will be the more disposed to grant the necessary relief. There is a novelty in the Bill to which I desire to call your lordships' attention. It enables parties to do that by a short course which they can now do by an expensive and circuitous proceeding. I doubt very much whether it is desirable to acopt such a course. My lords, let me remind you when my noble and learned friend is introducing a clause into this Bil for the purpose of facilitating the voluntary separation of husband and wife that that is contrary to the law of England. Lord Hardwicke, I may state, expressed his opinion in the strongest ternms against the legality of voluntary separations,
htIshall not go so far back as that. I must, however, reter your lordships to the opinions of other eminent judges uponthesubject. Lord Stowell laid down the rule which prevailed in his time in Doctors' Comnons on the subject in these words:
This Court considers a private separation as an illegal contract, implying a dereliction of stipulated duties, which the parties are not at liberty to desert *" and, after enlarging
o nspoint, he concludes by saying that the ecclesiasticail courts "to which the law has appropriated the right of adjudicating upon the matrimonial contract, have uniformly rejected such covenants as insignlificant in a plea of bar."
again, Lord El!don said he considered deeds of separation contrary to the policy of the law. If, then, it has 'not been held by the ecelesiastical courts or by the Court of Chancery to be wise and prudent to encourage such private separations, and if they have been regarded as contrary to the policy of the law, why should we new adopt a
measure for the purpose of facilitating the practiee 9 I mlst explain that in cases where parties have separated, and the Court of Chancery is called upon to intervene with respect to agreements founded on the articles of separation, all the learned judges of the court have protested against interfering, and have considered it oontrary -Id
ublic lito do so. They have considered themselves ound ryprevious deisions, but the tenour of their laa. age 'was that, if it depended on them, they should never adopt such a principle, Spzeaing of covenants arising out
of such separations, Lord Ihdon observed that Lord StoweUl
doubted wlether cvenanNts arising out of pnvah sepafations were legal conrat, and oughtt to be the foundation of an action for spec5fie performance> and added, "Tnat doubt has long since had place in my mind." Again hie says,
'That if this point were re-consadered be would not have permitted sucha ceovenant to be the foundation of aetion at law or a suit in Chancery." Sir William Grant is equally precise on the subject. He says
" It is now settled that courts of equity will not ca
into execution articles of separation between husband and wife. They recognize no power in themto vary the rights and duties gowing out of the marriage, or to effect, at their own pleasure, a partial dissolution of it. It does ieem strange "(he is referring now to the agreementsfounded on
articles of separation) "that the auxiliary agreement should be enfored, 'while the principal agreement is held to be ontrary to the spirit and policy of the law."
I hope Ihave not tired your lordshipe with these passages.
(Heor, hear.) They are of the utmost importance, because
they come to this-that the Countt consider the agreements ef aepaatoig cor.t y -to- iublicpobcy an nonnisient with the eontract of marriage. SomethingElis been grafted upon this, hoilever, which has led to a different conr dusion as to the auxiliary part, but in giving effect to the auxiliarypart, though the judges have been compelled to abide by previous dicta, they have all protested against the original seption. It is on these grounds, then, that Ls3y
your lorda hps should do nothing to facilitate a sep amtion., which all mnen who have considered the subject believe to be inconsistent with the law of marriage and at var4nce with public policy. But my noble and learned friend goes much urtherthan the present law. As that law stands, I believe -though it is true I have not been in courts of justice lately -that a contract is not binding upon the wife. She may at any time sue for a restitution of conjupaI rights in the ecclesiastical courts, and I believe there is no case in wvhich a court of equity has ever enjoined the wife against taking such a proceeding. Therefore my noble and learned fziend is not merely facilitating an action under the present law, but he is going one step further. At present, although a man may have entered into a covenant such as I have described, it by no means follows that, if he sues in an ecclesiastical court for the restitution of marital rights, the Court of Chancery will enjoin him against such a proceeding. In the case of " Wilson v. Wilson," which came before the House on appeal in 1854, there was a covenant not to proceed in the ecclesiastical court. What didmy noble and learned friend-then alsoholding the Great Sealsay upon that point? He said it was true there was a covenant, but he must leave the parties to their natural
rights, he would not interfere with the jurisdiction of the - ecclesiastical court. I say, then, that my noble and learned
friend is not mnintaining, but is altering the law by this, Bill; and if he does that which is, as I believe, contrary to what all the judges have considered as consistent with public policy, contrary to the law of marriage, and the contracts arinmg out of it, then, my lords, unless my noble and leazned frien makes a great alteration in his Bill, I think be will not succeed in passing it through both Houses of Parliarnent. In the same case of " Wilson v. Wilson," my noble and learned friend (Lord St, Leonard's) expressed the following opinon:-
"For it does not at all follow, because the court of equity compels the appellant in this case to enter into a covena,
that he will not, by the force of ecclesiastical censures, connpel restitation of his conjugal rights, that the Court would enjoin him from breaking that covenant which he has entered into; the Court', I apprebend, would leave hiur to answer any action that might be brought for damages un
the covenant. What amount would be recovered would b'e another question."
So that you will see, when a party enters into a covenant, in consequence of an agreement of separation, that he wil not sue for the restitution of conjugal righ s inthe ecclesiastical
court, it does not follow that the Court of Chancery. will. enjoin him from such a proceeding, because the other partj has another proceeding open-namely, the recoTery ofdamages by an action for a breach of covenant. I hope, therefore, my lords, that my noble and learned friend will so alter the clause I refer to that when we go into committee *the objections I have urged against it maybe in some mea sure obviated. I trust I shall be pardoned for the observa tions with which I have touble our ordships, but the deep interest I feel upon this question must be my excuse. (Hear, hear.)
The Bishop of EXETER (who was very indistinctly heard) rose to move the postponement of the second reading of this Bill for three months, in order to give the rnob'e and learned lord on the woolsack time to amend it. By the present Bill, it was enacted that the proposed noe
court should sit at Westminster. Now, that might be very well for the people of Surrey and Middlesex, but what advantage could it be to the people of Cumberland or Yorkshire ? It was, no doubt, true that by certain provisions of the Bill evidence could be taken in the country by commission, but surely it would do away with aU the advantage which the Bill proposed to confer on the poor man if he were put to the expense of an inquiry by a commission. Their lordships must remember that they were legislating, not for the benefit of the opulent, but on a question which was essentially a people's question, aid which affected not only their domestic happiness but also their religion, and to put a poor man to the expense of an inquiry by commission would be a perfect mockery, for if the court itself were not carried into the country neither would justice be so. He trusted therefore that their lordships would not sanction a measure which in reality infringed upon the relief which the people had aright to expect. As to the proposed cou,t at Westminster, its form of procedure would be that of the' Ecclesiastical Court, and yet the Deanof the Arches would be the only one of the judges conversant with that method of procedure. It was necessary that their lordships shouldlook at this case in a somewhat larger view than they had hitherto done, and that they should regard it as connected with those great statutes of reformation which were passed in the times of Henry VIII., Edward .VL, Elizabeth, and Charles IL They must make up their minds to give their whole thoughts to the subject, and they must not fancy that they had a light labour to undergo, for they might depend upon it that the web which had been woven by the Church ofItome was not to be easily broken through. It was not by a few smart sayings that they could get rid of a system which had been inaugurated by the wisest but most corrupt of churches - nd he must say that in his opinion the question had down to this time been most partially and superficially dealt with. If they meant to carry out the matter satisfactorily they ought (as we understood) to appointa commission which should have the power of examining learned divines as to the doctrines of the church on the subject. The commissioners who had previously reported upon it had exhibited a marvellous urfitness for the mnuiry, and it was evident that they wanted some one to te em what was the law of Go and how the law had been carried out, not in Rome, but in a purer state of the church. The doctrine of matrimony and divorce had been taken up by a very wise Sovereign, Constantine, who undertook it about the year 331 with the advice of the bishops of those days, and, having learned from them what the divine law of the question was, he applied also the wisdom of human laws, and propounded a scheme which was incomparably better than anything which had been propos. d since; and their lordships would remember that Constantine gave to injured husbands a divorce in the event of adultery and one or two other matters on the part of the wife, but that he refused to give it to the wife, in the event of adul. tery on the part of the husband, unless there were certain other ingredients in the case. With regard to the doctrine of divorce a mend d thoro, he thought that it was wholly inapplicable tothe nature of the offence and to the circumstances of the law. It was unknown by the Church of Christ at any period, except under the dominion of Rome; but they were now asked permanently to inffict that corrupt system upon the church and nation of England, He regretted to find that thero was no clause in the bill similar to that which had been proposed by the noble and learned lord opposite in the committee for extingishing for ever that foul reproach to the English people and the English law, the right of action for crinminal conversation. (Hear, hear.) He should be perfectly satisfied if he were told that there was to be a separate measure immediately introduced for the purpose of abolishing that action but he thought that there were some considerationswhich would render such a provision particularly applicable to the present Bill. In the committee it was also proposed that the adulterous parties should be liable to the punishment of misdemeanour. Whetherthat was the right mode of dealing with the subject he would'not stop to inquire, but upon this portion of the case he observed that under the most favourable circumstances of jnstice being brought home, as it were, to every man's door, there would always be a considera le expense incurred in connexion with these proceedings, and he suggested, therefore, that a clause should be introduced compelhng the individual who inflicted the injury to bear aUlthe expenses of the process. He apprehended that there would be no difficulty in inserting a clause to that effect. He thought that, in the present state of the Bill, it was not one that ought to pass. Such a measure ought to receive the consideration of men of different professions, especially of the clei ; and persons well acquainted with the divine law and with the practice of different Christian countries ought to be examined before the commission. It would not do to found such a Bill on the opinions of lawyers alone, however eminent. He had not asked a single individual to support him, but, if he stood alone, he would ask their lordsinps to read this Bill a second time that day three months.
Lord ST. LEONARD'S said that the present Bill left the law on the subject of divorce exactly as it found it. The Bill only proposed to give to another court that great pre. rogative hitbherto exercised by Parliament. Complaints had been made that Parliament withheld from the poor what it gave to the rich, but the opening of the new Court of Divorce, which would give a remedy both to rich and poor, would remove thatreproach. He should thereforebe disposed to give his assent to this Bill if it assumed the shape that h3 thought it ought to have. He was not disposed to alter the law, but he would give to the proposed court the power which at the present time was only exercised by Parliament. To suppose, s some did, that it would be easy to
obtain a divorce, and at a light expense, was, he feared,
somewhat chimericaL A rev. prelate had objected to a centralized court, but was it possible in cases of this kind to have a roving comnission, or even to have stationary courtg in various parts of the conntry? He desired as far as possible to put the poor man on a level with the rich, but he did not desire to give such means of divorce as would lead men and women inconsiderately into these
courts, as if they were going to demand the payment of A common account. At present there was less inequality than Wk.s generally supposed, because a poor man who came into court and swore that ho was not possessed of more than a cettain sum might sue in fornmd pauperis. In many cases divorces had thus been granted to poor men without expense, and it was mot true, therefore, to say that a poor man could not prosecute his rights and obtain justice. There were but few cases compratively in which this remedy had been afforded 'to the rich, and many cases in which thete had been denials of divorces to those who were rich. He ,should be_sorry to see a clause introduced into the Bil pro-
hibitng the mariage of the adulterer vith the woman he had dehche. Theoretically, be had never believed that the law ought to prevent the man who had committed the wrong from remeying the wrong to the woman whose prospects he had destroyed. Practically, he believed that in many cases there could not be a more sure punishment upon the man than the necessity of marring the woman whom he had ruined. (Hear, hear.) The moment the marriage tie was broken and dissolved the woman was at liberty to marry again, and a man was bound in point of honour, and could scarcely evadetheclaim, howeverdegraded, to marry the woman. No doubt a man would be glad in many cases to shield himself when caUed upon to repair the wrong he had done, under the pretence that he was prohibited from marrying the wooman, but to give him the lberty to marry her would be a salutary check rather than an en-
couragement to adultery. }e trusied thWa actions to recover dimages-for adultery would be nbolished, for if therv*aa anything more disgraceful than - another in our legal procedure it was this action for damages. He should like to know what a man was to d6&with the money so recovered? Was he to mix it with his common funds? Would he touch it any more than hS w'oula touch scorpions? It as utterly impossible for a man to touch money paid under such circunstances, but the man who was guilty ought not to escape, and what he would suggest was to abolish that form of action which disgraced us in the eyes of foreign nations - to make the injury a misdemeanour, wbich e husbana alone should have the right of prosecuting; and to punish, on conviction, by a fine to the Crown. He wonid not have it imperm tive that the husband should have taken proceedings against the seduicer before suing for a divorpe a vincuto, becanse the husband might be a poor man; but he would bring before the Court of Divorce the unhappy lady and the seducer. They should both bc eard, and the Court shonld have the power to impose a fine upon the one, snd to pronounce a dissolution of the bonds of marriage as to the other. If a wife were deserted for two years he would give her alimony, but not a divorce a mcwd et thoro, as was proposed in this Bill, though not in the Bill last year, and not authorized by any recommendation of the committee. It was difficult to remedy the injustice of the husband, who had left his wife, suddenly coming down upon her and sweepaing off all the property she had realized by her exe ions smince his desertion, but he would try to overcome thxt difficulty by taking away that right of the husband after his desertion had continued a certain time. He entirely objected to the important alteration of the law of England by the provision enablng married couples to separate byprivate arrangement betwveenthemselves, and making suchsepArationdeodsabartotbe restittitionof conjugal rights. According to the present state of the law, a man and his wife coul not separate. Their mutual tie could not be evered except under Tea7 peculiar circumstances, and it was the object of. the Legislature not to create facilities for the severance of that tie. The provision in the Bill relating to volnntary separations was open to grave objections. At present, if a woman desired toseparate from her husband she
Pa to procure a friend who entered into covenautswith the husband to hold him harmless from all debts contracted by the, fw4e, and other stipulations of an onerous cbaracter. Thus no person would wilingly assume such a responsibility, and the conseqaence was that when the wife applied to her friends they in the first instance asked whether it was necessary to separate, and inculcated ,3nutual forgiveness ad forbearance-advice which in many cases avoided the necessity for any separation between the parties Under the bill there would be no such wholesome interference; npon the slightest difference of opinion recourse would be had to the provision in the Bill, and the extreme step of separation would be taken. (Hear.) And then, again, in the event of there being children, no consideration of their interests was to be fonnd in the BilL With respect to the composition of the new court tobe established, he did not approve the scheme proposed. In the debate upon the Testamentary Jurisdiction Bill he had suggested that the judge of the Prerogative Court should be the judge of the new court to be created under that Bill
and so in this instance he thought the Dean of Arches should still have the administration of matrimonial business. He thought the best course would be to take this Bill and the Testamentary Jurisdiction Bill together, and to vest the supreme authority in both courts in the same judge.
The Bishop of OXFORD, without beimg able to acquiesce in all the argnmentsof his right rev. brotLer, would feel himself bound to vote for the amendment if it were pressed to a division. He assumed that in all legislation upon this subject the first obvious principle to be observed was to surround marriage with every new fence and every guard that could be devised. After a careful perusal of the Bill before heoHouse, he had arrived at the conclusion that it had been framed upon a totally different principle. No one could desire to be freed from the tie of marriage without the existence of sin on one if not on both sides. In granting sny relaxations of the present law the first consideration ought to be whether, by granting that relaxation to a few persons whom sin had brought into difficulties, injury was not done to numerous innocent persons who were maintaining the sanctity of marriage. (Hear.) Hereded the provision relating to voluntary separations as affording an indication of the principles upon which the Bill had been constructed. It was the introduction of a totally new principle-that upon the occasion of any slight difference or misunderstanding between a married couple they could proceed to destroy the most solemn religious compact of marriage. That provision marked the animus with which the Bill had been framed. At present persons separated were in an anomalous and not creditable position, because the law bad not sanctioned their separation. He thought the Bill was undoubtedly in its chief provisiona a delusion, because it professed to be an attempt to do away with the superior advantages, as they were called, whichthe rich possessed over the poor in this matter, but, practicaly, did not advance a sngle step towArds that end. He contended that the more their lordships brought down those actions to the lower ranks of society the more danger there would be of collusion. (Hear, hear.) The Bill did not, he repeated, do away with the difference between the several ranks of society in this particular point. But there was another ground on which it was objectionable, and it was this,-if they dealt with this question at all he thought, for one, they were bound to o away with that foul reproach on our law, the action for criminal conversation. =e was not prepared to read any Bill a second time that did not face the difficulties which beset that question. Of all others, a Government Bill oupht to have presented some mode of meeting those diffilculties. The House ought to have the wholo scheme before them in its completeness l efore they were asked to deal with it. (Ifear, hear.) Those were great fundamental principles with which they ought to deal in the Bill under consideration before it was read a second time. When they had a measure so scanty in many of the most essential requirements he thought if they proceeded further with it in its present shape they would involve themselves in the most inextricable confusion hereafterin dealing with this subject. The voluntaryseparation clause was, perhaps, the most remarkable thing about the Bill. He thought he remembered to have heard it said by a noble and learned lord in a former debate that the principle of voluntary separations was part of the law of France, and was found to work welL He (the Bisbop of Oxford) contended that there was no such principle in the law of France, even in the laxest of all codes on marriage-that of 1792. Besides, in most, if not all, of the other countries on the continent the system of voluntary separation had been repudiated. The French law laid down this principle, that " marriage does not subsist for spouses alone, but for the children, and for society; it is in its essence permanent, and we cannot fix a term to it." (Hear.) lie tberefore on these grounds would strongly beg their lordships to adopt the motion which had been made by his right rev. friend (the Bishop of Exeter). He repeated they ought to have a nobler basis on which to legislate on this most important subject. He might be suffered to remind their*lordships that, even with all the evils of the existing system, they could hardly calculate the mischiefs they might do by F.eddling with it, and that, in dealing with the subject, the deeper they descended into the lower strata cf society the greater would be the distnrbing influences they would have to encounter. (Hear, hear.) The presentsystem might require change; but, in God's name, let alterations, iZ any such were made, be most maturely weighed. Let them be alterations which would suggest to every mind the idea that they were final ; that they were not the begmining of a set of changes with regard to this holy law; that they were, as far as the Legislature could make them, final-final because they were the embodiment of the conviction of the great minds of En2land that these laws had been made to accord with the law of God. (Hear, hear.) Such changes should not be introduced as an expedient to get rid of present difficulties, as if in dealing with the law of marriage Parliament was dealing with some of the trifling rules affecting the transfer of property, but as though it was dealing with a great institution of God, upon which the purity and the happiness of this Christian land, more than upon any one other matter, did indeed depend. (Cheers.) It was because he believed that this Bill could lay no claim in its principles to be the embodiment of such an idea-because he believed it would shake everything and settle nothing-because he believed it would tend greatly to unhinge men's minds as to the sanctity of maarrage, and would lead to no permanent and purifying result, that he ventured to entreat their lordships not to give it a second reading. (Cheers.)
Lord WENSLEYDALE could not concur in the pro. posal to defer the second reading of this Bill for three months, and believed it was imperative upon his noble and learned friend on the woolsack to introduce the measure in the present session. The BiUl had its origin in the recommendation of a committee consis'ing of very learned and eminent persons, among whom were the Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Qneen's Bench, Dr. Lushington, and other high authorities, who recommended the establishment of a court differing in construction from that existing before, which should take cognizance in all cases matrimonial, and possess the additional power of dissolving marriage. Now, it was abundantly clear that, from the time of the Reformation to the present day, the law of England was that a legal marriage should not be dissolved except by Parliament, and he must own that upon this part of the Bill he had some
misgivings. Generally speahing, it was not a fit thing to confide to a court of law, which was established for the settlement of disputes between man and man, that relief which Parliament ought alone to give. Last session his noble and learned friend brought in a Bil enabling the Court of Chancery to grant certain powers to tenants for life, which powers before that time could only be conferred by Parliament. No doubt such a measure, saving the publc,
as it did, the time and expense involved in passing private Bills through larliament, was a wise and beneficial one, When, however, the question was as to the propriety of givingto a law tribunal the power of deciaing wbetheror not divorces should be granted, he confessed that upon that point
he entertained some doubt. (Hear, hear.) The ro6eedin.s in Parliament were exceptional proceedings. Parliament, too, laid downcertain rnles beyond which they had not beenecaDed upon to go-as, for example, that a divorce shonld be grazted on the ground of the wife's adultery, or incestuous adultery on the part of the hnsband. Were thzey to intrast such riasdaction as this to in ordinary cout ? (Hear.) It was aid thatthis would be givio g to each party a heabermodeof obtaining the redress to which he or she was entited. His fear was, however, that if such a jurisdiction
as that contemplated in this BiU were created nO antwer could be given to any future demand for an extendon of the power of deciding these questions - and no one could then
say why it houli not be brought otme to the door of every
poor man, and why the County Court should not have au-
thority to dissolve the mnarriage tie, (HIear.) That, in his ,opinion, woufld be a vary serious evil, and he thought It extremelylikely to introduce into the lowreroiders a degree of profligacy and a corruption of manners which could
hardlja contemplated vwithont dismay. It was argued t At t isnt bo-a fIseahrm, becausein Sotland, where I differenlatateo of the law prevailed with regard to divorces frnm thakt row existing in this country, no such evils enncd. The Scotcl, however, besides being a moral Ieo le
lad rong been accustomed to this law, and he did no thInkj such an alteration- in the English system as the present rLeasure seemed to involve would have the same harmless effect upon the people of this country. This, however, was only a presumption of his own, and inasmuch as the question had already been discusoed, and the principle to -which he bad 2eferred had been decided on by a large majority, be felt it impossible on this ground to refuse to go into committee, where, perhaps, the provisions of the Bill might receive satisfactory alteration. He would say the same respecting tho points of detail referred to by his noble and learned friend (Lord Lyndhurst) and by the right rev. prelate who had just addressed their lordships. His noble and lcarned friend had stated that deeds of separation of husband and wife were contrary to publi policy. The legality of these deeds had certainly been questioned more tkan once by Lord Eldon and other authorities, but there was not the least doubt that they were as rfectly legal as an;r other contract, and night he enfo in every court of tuatice. [Lord Lyndhurst.-,y injunction ? (Hear, hear.) X o, certainly not, because he was aware of the case of " Wn and Wilson;" but if his noble and learned friend maintained that an action arising out of these contracts would not lie, and that such oontracts were ilegal and void, this would be a doctrine which no otner man in the professon would hold. It might be that a court of equity ould not take cognizance of such contracts, but that these oontracts would be held valid in any court of law he apprehended there was not a momenVs doubt. This being so, it would be for their lordships to consider in committee whether the law on all these points of detail should remain as it was, or hould undergo revision. He saw no reason why they should not consider the different clauses of the Bill in committee, and for that reason he should certainly give his vote against the postponement. (Hear.)
The Earl of DERBY.-Icame down, mylords,with the intention of votingin favourof the second readingof this Bill, because I thought that the advantage which might be produced by it would preponderate over the disadvantage; but I have never in the course of my experience heard a speech which has caused me to feel so mnuch hesitation as to what vote I shal give as that of the noble and learned lord who has just sat down. (Hear, hear.) In the first place, I should naturally approach with great reluctance and doubt a subject involving such important considerations as a Bill must do which affects marriage and divorce, and when I find that the principle of this BilU is condemned in a most able manner and with great eloquence by the only two members of the right rev. bench who are present on this occasion, those feelings of doubt and reluctance must naturallybe much increased. (Hear, hear.) I should have tbought, my lords, that if there were one question to which the heads of the church in their legislative capacity were bound to give their utmost attention and consideration, and to advise your lordships as to what is the law of the church, what, in their opinion, is the law of God, and what the effect upon the moral and social condition of the people under the present system, t&at question would be the question of marriage and divorce. (Hear, hear.) It is to me a matter of deep regret that, on a recent occasion, when the subject under your lordships' consideration was almost entirely of a secular character no less than 23 right rev, prelates give their votes, and that on the present occasion, when it would well becomne the right rev. bench to enlighten your lordbhips on this mabject, there are only two right rev, prelates present. (Hear, hear.) When again, I turn to the legal authorities, and, without any disrespect to the noble and learned lord who spoke last, I may say the highest legal authoritles, my doubts are increased. The noble and learned lord himself, although ho has stated his willingness to go into committee on this Bill, has expressed grave doubts as to the expediency of substituting a court of law to supersede the exceptional jurisdiction of your lordship' House. lTow, my lords, thAt appears to me to be the very.essence of the Bil. The whole principle of the Bill is to do away with the present exceptional course of proceeding and to bring every case before a judicial tribunal, and I don't, therefore, understand howr the noble and learned lord can be prepared to go into committee upon a Bill about the principle of which he entertains grave doubts. (Hear, hear.) I cannot go so far as the ripht rev. prelate has done in believing that by the lawv of God marriage is indissoluble.
The Bishop of EXETER had not intended to convey that impression, for he admitted its dissolubility in certain c3ses.
The Earl of DERBY.-Then, as I understand the right rev. prelate, marriage is dissoluble according to the law of God in certain caes. (" Hear, hear," from the Bishop of Exeter.) I do not, then, my lords, object to the principle of the BiU which lays down the doctrine of the dissolubility of marriage in cases of proved adultery, nor do I object to the principle which declares that those cases shall be dealt with by a Judicial tribunal accordin& to established judicial rnles of proceedin;, instead of being dealt with as exceptional cases. Adopting, therefore, tbeso two principles, I am prepared to go intio committe upon this Bill. (Hear, hear). I agree with the right rev. prelat (the Bishop of Oxford) that a more workmanlike measure might have been brought forwabrd by the Government-a measure which would have dealt with the other matters to which reference had been made. Still agreeing with the right rev. prelate, I go further and say that this Bill ought to be a final measure, and r think that it would be a great misfortune if it went out of your lordships' Honse without dealing with those other important subjects which have been touched upon in the course of this discussion. I quite concur with my noble and learned friend (Lord St. Leonard's) that this Bil shonld not pass through your lordships' House without some provision being added to it repealing the scandalous action for damages in cases of criminal conversaBtion. (fHear, hear.) I know not - for I had not the honour of being a member of it-upon what groumd the committee of last year thought it necessary to repudiate theoproposal to consider these two questions together, and to do away with that odious action, at the same time imposing a penalty upon the adulterer. There is in law no difficulty in imposing a penalty upon a man who has robbed the person who has trustedhim of a trifling sum of money, and it is open to the judge and jury, more especially to the judge, to take into consideration whether there has been any undue neglnce on the part of the prosecutor, or anyundue exposure of his property. Yet
in the case in which the highest injury is inflicted which man can inflict on man, in which a man is robbed by the man whom he has trusted ef that which is dearer to him than anything upon the face of the earth, when his social position and the reputation and success in life of his children are affected by the wrong done to him by his friend, the law says thatthat minjury shaU not be visited with any penal consequences, buttbat the person injured may obtain in the shape of a sum of money a paltry reparation for an irreparable wrong. (Hear, hear.) I admit, my lords, that nothing can be more absurd than to attempt to make men moral or virtuous by Act of Parliament, but the question is whether we may not employ the criminal law advantageonsly to check an outrage upon society. I cannot understand upon what principle any hesitation can be felt in accepting the principle of doing away with the present disgraceful achon for damages, and imoosing upon the adulterer a crhinmal penalty. (HElar, 'hear.) I do not understand why the discretion .should not be allowed in each case of visiting the offenco with fine or imprisonment as in ether misdemeanours. If you visit it with fine a1one you place the rich man in a better position than the poor; and if you say that in the event of the fine not being paid imprisonment shaU follow the rich adulterer will have comparative impunity, while the poor man may have to undergo a long term of imprisonment. We are, my lords, severe enough, and properly so, upon the crimes of violence, robbery and attacks upon property or life, in which the lower classes are subject to greater temptation than we are; and it is our duty to take good care that there shall be no feeling on the part of the country that those temptations to which the rich are at least as much exposed as the poor should be deemed less criminal and treated with less severity. (Hear, hear.) litrast, therefore, that this session will not pass over and that this Bill will not leave your lordships' House without there being some such measure passed or engrafted upon this Bill as was proposed by my noble and learned friend, and that A e shall do away at once and for ever with that opprobrium on our law, the action for damages for criminal conversation. (Hear, hear.) There are two or three other clauses which have already been adverted to which appear to me to be verv objectionable. The 17th clause, for exmple, it is impossible ever to agree to. Everything which tends to give additional facilities to the hasty separatioa of married persons, without affording time for the passions to cool, or for the intervention of the advice, assistance, and counsel of friend, should, in my opinion, be carefully guarded against; for it is not the policy of the Legislature to encourage those eptarations hastily, without due consideration, and without
those ebeks which the lawv at preseut imposes. (Hear, hear.) I agree with my noble and learned friend aso in his ojection to the 15th clause of the bill, which, contrary to thereconmuendation of the committee, permits the granting of a divorce a medC taoro to the wife upon the
ond of adultery. I think, with m nobIs and learned friend, that that is carying the principlo further than is desired. I agree that there otight to be a provision by wrhich the wrife may be secured and protected in the event of long-continued desertion by her bushand; but when my noble and learned friend said that
there was no provision for securing to the wife any property obtained by her own exertions after her desertion, I think that he overlooked the ISth cluse, which would givo
her entire protection in the case of a divorce n mei ci thoro. On the whole, I look upon this as being very far from a perfect measure. oe have a choice of evils and of difficulties In this matter; but the state of the la
at present is such that we caunot adhere to it as it stands, and the question is whether we shall absolutely prohibit all dissolution of the marrisge tie, or whether we shalLadopt some such provisions as the present Bill contains, which shall make the law positve ad conlusive, instead of being aS now optional anduncertain. Under these circumstanm I shall vote for the secend readingof the bill, trusting that it will receive the fullest consideration before it puses through commlttee. (Hear, hear.)
The Marquis of LANSDOWNE.-An opposition has been raised to the seoeandading of this Bil which I must say I hardly anticipated, tiAuse it is only carrying oUt that which hasbeentbhemanifest Intention of Parliament for years pas. I utterly deny that the Bil which has been laid upon your lordships' table is calculated to facilitate divorces or to render the law of marriago more lax. Its object has been to recrd tho principle that the present mode of effecting divorces is liable to great and serious objections,
and to substitute for that which has been found to be attended with so many evils a more safe, i more just, and, let me add, a more decent method of dealing withi s4ch cases, (Elear.) It is intended to csy out suggestiqna which were discussed in a committeo of your lordshipis' House, and to give effect to that which has already the o6n. current approbation of almost all aides of the House and almost al classes of the country. But the BiU effects tfiat partly by moans and machinery which were suggested last year, and partly by some additions which havo been muadO with tho view of obtaining for it. a more universal oonsent. It isunneces6ary for mo to enulag u,pon the subject of actions for criminal conversation, because I endeavonred to impress upon your lordships last year what were my views with respect to it; and because my noble and learned friend on the woolsack wvell knows that my constant opinion has been that neither this Bill hor rny BiU of this nature ought to pass if it were not aocompanied, or immediately followed, by a Bill removing that Ereat stigma upon the legislation, the manners, tho habits, and the customs of this country-the trial for what is called " criminal conversation," which exists in no other courntry in the world, and which, existing here, is represeated ir all other countries in the world as an indication of, I will ziot say the "degraded," bat of the loose, selfish. and sordid principles which prevail in this oountry. (Hear, hear.
When I am told that the Bil as it now stands, does nothing to remedy that practice, your lordships must bear in mind that most of thoso actions have been instituted with a view to obtain that which could be obtained in no other way, the divorce not being procurable until such an action bad been brought. (Hear, hear.) I agree with your lordships in opinion that this Bil ought to bo for the poor as well as for the rich- but I apprehend, so far as the Bill goes, that greater facilities will be afforded by it to persons who approach the trbunals of justice than exist na.w. . At present many actions are necessary, and the expenses are great; and even if the attendant expenses should stil be h yt all events all the legal poison, so to spek, will be concentrated in one place, .and all the fees paia and all tho extortion incurred-if there be any-wiU bo nader one roof and in one proceeding. (Elear, bear.) I think it Is mnOst important that this Bil shouldpass. Itis-not improbable, as the right rev. prelate has foretold, that tyou may have a greater number of divorces under the operation of this Bill, but they will only be permitted where they are required. And, my lords, judging from my observation, and speaking as a member of society, I believe that the evils arising froma the want of the' power of divorce are as great among the lower orders of this country as among the higher classes-nay, I believe them to be greater. I believe that the vice and misery of every kind that ensue from the want of this power of separation, are much greater among the lower orders of this country than-among the upper classes. Among the poorer classes this want notponly leads to actual vice that is tolerated by the absence of divorce-the wife hving in a state of adultery and incontinency; but to that other vice which is the greatest bane of the lower orders of this country-the vice of drunkenness. I have found in my own neighbourbood, and I dare say the testimony of every noble lord who hears me as to the itanners of his neighbourhood wil be to the same effect, that many drunken persons have been led to that habitual state Of drunkenness from having a debauched wife, with whom they could not live in peace at home, whom they'could not respect, and whose iU conduct leads them to go abroad and in ulge in those habits of drankenness. (Hear, hear.). So that, while the wife lives in a state of vice, and has inter. course with another man, the husband is led, from the, impossibility of obtaining a separation from her, to indulqe in habits of drunkeeness. (Hear.) It is possible that, if the House will go into the inquiry, some means may be found of extending the tribunal having cognizance of these cases to every part of the country. The experiment hving been once trsed and succeeded, it may be possible to extend the power, at least of obtaining evidence, to every part of the country, and then we may attain that which must be the object of all your lordships
and extend the power of obtaining a divorce to ali classes equaUy. Before I sit dowvn let me add one word on the lth clause, which gives married persons the pbwer to separate by arrangement. I think that you should require a certain interval between the signifcation by the parties of an intention to separate and the time when-that declaration acquires a legal force and effect. We have a precedent for this in the French code. By that cede a divorce for a sAparation edc corps is not given at ence, The parties have to signify their intention, which is formally notified through the myors of the communes, and has no effect until after the lapse of a year or two, according to circumstances, If at the end of that time the parties manifest their intention to persevere, the notice then ac sires the forei and subttance of a law. I have understood; on the beet authority, that the result of that interval of delay is that a very large proportion of the parties who have signified an intention to separate come forward at the end of the year, aDd declare themselves changed and reconcied to each other by the mere operation of the law, which thus interposes a valuable test by compelling the parties deliberately to review their intentions. If your lordships adopt some modification of the law in this respect it may be very desirable; but in principle the law of France is sound, because I am satisfied that there exists in England in the higher classes of society as well as in the lower a practical separationon the part of those who desire to separate more forrmally, and to come before a tribunal which cau give validity to those arrangements which ought to be madc, but which at present these parties are not able to enforce, For the want of such a tribunal these parties live in a state of conflict, which is the occasion of incessant disputes and torment, and is productive of nothing but mischief to the family. And, my lords, when I am told that it is the interest of the children that these separations should not take place, I say that the interests of the children will be better providod for under a separation regularly entered into, and where the tribunal wHi give validity to the contracts made between the parties, than where the children are left to witness disputes between parties who wish to separate, but who live together-for the purposes of hatred, because they are not able to give legal orm and solemnity to their separation. It might be true that these separations did not exist in France during the iniquitous period of 1792. The revolutionists encouraged divorce rather than separation, but upon the first occasion on which the question of divorce was reconsidered the French immediately had recourse to a s6paration de corps, which is now the law in France, and which exists under the modificalions I have described. (Hear, hear,) I do not pretend to say that I think this Bill perfect, or that it ought to go forth in its present shape without amendment. But the subject has been long considered. We have had the report of acommission and of a committee of both Houses of Parliament, and there is no reason for interposing any further delay. Your lordships may rely upon it that this question of divorce wil remam a constant subject of discussion until you reform the existing state of things. I trust that your lordships will not oppose the second reading of the Bil, and that -you will agrf e to it for the purpose of making the Bill perfect in committee. (Cheers.
Earl GREY said that if he voted for the amendment of the right rev. prelate, he should not do so because he was an advocate for the existing state of things. No man was more strongly of opinion than himself that the present state of the law was disgraceful and ought not to be allowed to continue; but it must be admitted that the right rev. prelate had been successful in showing that the Bill was extremely imperfect, and his noble friend who had just sat down had given additional reasons for this belief. The very foundation of the Bill was the constitution of the court which would have to decide questions of divorce. The noble marquis siid that it was more necessary that facilities for divorce should be extended to the very lowest class of society than to any other, but if that werethe object of the Bill, and if it were a Bill for the poor, was it not a mockery to constitute a court of which the Dean of Arches was one member, the Lord ChauceHor another, and the three chiefs of the Common Law Courts the remaining members? How would such a court deal with the number of cases that cams before them? It was matter of extreme difficulty and doubt how far they ought to afford facilities for divorce, but his opinion was that Parliament ought to provide some means by which aU ranks of society sbould be relieved from wives who had conimitted adultery. The measure was shown by its supporters to be altogether inadequate to accomplish the object which they had in view. He was perfectly persuaded, from experience inbothHouses of Parliament, that to read an inmiature and ill-digested measure a second time was not the way to expedite reform, and, being thoroughly convinced that this Bill was so essentially defective it was impossible it could ever be made a perfect piece of legislation, he should vote for the amendment or the right rev. prelate. Let the Government take this Bill back, revise it carefuly, get the best assistance they could, and lay upon the table such a measure as their lordships might pass with a fair expectation of obtaining for it the sanction of the other House of Parliament, and of its working, when brought into operation, in a manner satisfactorytothecountry. (Hear,hear.)
Lord REDESDALE was confirmed in the opinion which, as a member of the commission, he had expressed, that it was impolitio to introduce any law by vwhich divorces a Vinculo could be obtained. The objections taken arainst
this meaure were objections against any measure oa the kind. (Hear, hear,l )What their lordships ought to dowa
steadfastly to uphold the law, and refuac to grant exceptional Acts for the eisohon of marriage. From the earliest peried no such remedy had ever been open to the nation at large andthe consequence wasthat inno country in the world was there mere domestic happiness or greater regard forthe marriage tie thanin England. (tear, hear.) It wa3s absurd to suppose that the principle of divorce,
if oneo admitted, would not be carried further, and ultimately divorces be granted for comparativelv light reasons. Belecving that this alteration was not demanded by
the people generaly, and that, if mde, it would causo grEater rnischiefs. than it would cure, relieving a few cases of hardship, but introducng misery into many families,
he sould certainly vote ainst the BilL. (Hear, hear.)
The LORD CHANCELLOR expressed surprise at the amount of opposition which had been offered to a Bill differing so littlo from that which recived theirlord. ships' sanction only in the last session. The right rev. prelate moved the postponement if the second reading, because on so important a question it was not proper to legislate withont much greater previous consideration. The subject had been referred to a select committee 10 or 12 years ago, and subsequently to a commission, whose elaborate report recommnended a measure substantially the same as the present. A Bill founded on that report was introduced in the la tession, and referred to a select committee, who for five long days gve to it the mnost anxious consideration ever given to any measure by any committee. They could not say that the question required more consideration. They might Fay that it was so tceet by difficulties no consideration conld ever produce a
satifactory colution, but that they could tver bope to give
U futher or better consideration was hoping against hope,
aud pretending to hopo that which no one over expected to t sealize. Then it was said, " this was a siiam," that they, were constituting a tribunal just as inaccessible to the great
bulk of Her Majesty's subjects as the present system of re- I lef; bat he denied that dit toto. He did not nmean to say that l the poor m^a would have the same facilities in applying to this Court as the rich man, but where was there any court in which thast was the emse? (Cheers.) 'ihat was one of the Advantages of ea'th vich could not be prevented. But the BllR would relieve the poor man from the necessity of applying to three expensive courts for 'redress. With regard to the constitution of the tribanal =proposed by the Bill, he would only remark that it had been approved by the commnission, by their lordships last -session, and bY the select committee to which the subject 'was referred. At the same time, he was quite willing to -consider any suggested improvement which any of their lordships ruight think fit to propose. There were some 'variatons from the Bil of last session which he had introduced, as he oonsidered them to be improvements upon *the mIeasuxe The select committee recommended that a 'womau deserted by her husband for two Tears without reasonable course should be entitled to claim alimony, to continue so long as the Court should order. He, however, bad changed thxt, and instead of granting her alimony had aiven her the power of asking for a divorce. lith respect to the 17th clause, relating to voluntary separations, about 'which so rmuch had been said, his object had been to facilitate the operation of the law, and not to facilitate separation. He admitted that the discussion had shown that some additional precautions were required, such as the lapse of a certain time, or the concurrence of certain friends; but those amendments could be made in com3attee. Many observations had been made respecting actions for crininal conversation which every one must vie- with disgust, but the committee found great diffi-culty in deahng with that subject, as it was a rule of that House not to grant a divorce unless an action had been brought. If that necessity was got rid of he believed that class of actions would speedily die a natural death. As to making adultery a nnisdemeanour there was also great difficulty, for how far was the offence to extend ? Was the woman also to be indicted? If so it would introduce quite a novel principle into our law. The real punishlment for the offence, he believed, would 'oe found in the Bil now before them, omitting the clause which prohibited the marxiage of the parties committing adulterv, -a prohibition unaeceseary and, he thought, impohtic. -Having made those few remarks, he hoped the House would assent to the second reading of the Bill.
The House then divided, when the numbers were
Contents... ... ... ... ... 25 Non-contents ... ... ... .. 10
Majority for the second reading... - 15 The Bill was, therefore, read a second time.
CHIEF CONSTABLES BILL.
On the motion of the LORD PRESIDENT, the House 'went into committee on the Chief Constables Bin.
The Earl of SANDWICH moved an addition to clause 11'that no person should be eligible to a new or additional ,office of Chief Constable whose age exceeded 50 years.
Earl GRANVILLE opposed the amendment, on the ground that it would introduce exceptional cases, with
hich it would be inconvenient and difflcult to deal in the face of an inflexible rule.
The Marquis of SALISBURY supported the amend'Anent.
The Earl of HARDWICKE thought, considering that the constitutions of men differed so much, it would be better to leave the question of age in this matter to the magistrates -or the Crown, to be decided according to circumstances.
The amendment was then put, and negatived.
Viscount DUNGANNON moved, "That no person shall be eligible to fil the office of chief constable who has been a bankrmpt, or who has passed througlh the Insolvent Court, uless such bankruptcy or insolvency shall be proved to the satisfaction of Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Home Department to have arisen from unforeseen or unfortunate circumstances, and not to have been the result of fraud or reckless extravagance."
Earl GRANVILLE thought the addition proposed was unnecessary. In the regulations made compulsory upon the magistrates they were bound to state to the Secretary of State any special fact respecting the chief constable which -came to their knowledge, and when such a fact as the insolvency or bankruptcy of this officer was represented to the SecretarY of State he would certainly insthtute an inquiry into the circumstances. This, therefore, would answer the -bject which the noble viscount had in view.
After a few words from the Earl of Po wis,
The committee divided, when the numbers were, -

The remaining clauses were then agreed to, and the louse resumed.

AMERICA.
LIVERPOOL4 TUESDAY.
The Liverpool and Philadelphia Company's screw steamship City of Baltimore, Captain Robert Leitch, arrived in the Mersey this afternoon after a rapid passage, with advicex from New York to the 19th nit. She brings no specie.
The House of Representatives had passed the Submarine Telegraph Bill,with the following amendmentg-
",That citizens of the United States shall have the right to the use of the line for all time instead of 50 years; that the lUnited States and the citizens thereof shall enjoy the use of the said submarine telegraph communication for all time on the same terms and conditions which shall be stipulated in favour of the Government of Great Britain and the subjects thereof, recognizing the equality of sights among the citizens of the United States in the use of the
ad submarine communication, and the lines of telegraph which may at any time connect with the same at its terxninus on the coast of Newfounaland and the United States, iu any contract so to be entered into by such persons or association with that Government."
An ineffectual effort was made to table the Bill, which was passed, amended as above, by a vote of 112 against 81. The amendments require the concurrence of the Senate.
In committee on the Tariff Bill, Mr. Campbell (Ohio) presented a Bill, and explained that it was that reported by a majority of the Committee of Ways and Means last session, and modified by adding various articles to the free list, and leaving the item of wool with a proviso that all wool of the value of 16c. or less and 50c. and over per lb. at the port of importation shall be duty free, and leaving the intermediate kinds with the present duty of 30 per cent. Lead, hemp, iron, and sugar remain as they are. This Bill would rednce the revenue $6,000,000 directly, and probably $4,000,000 to $6,000,000 indirectly, by the facilities it would give the manufacturing interests of the country. This, after a debate and the offering of other propositions, was agreed to as a substitute for Mr. Millson's bilL which contemplated a reduction on all the present schedules. The former was still open to amendment.
The Washington correspondent of the New Yorkl Courier and Euirer, remarking on the postponement of the Central American Treaty, says -
"The postponement of the treaty by a close vote, as yesterday ordered by the Senate, is a proof that it is not intended ultimately to reject it. Senators are fully awake to the importance of improving the present favourable opportunity for settling the existing difficulties with Great Britain. The strong vote against any delay conclusively shows their anxiety on this head. There are many reasons which, in the aggregate, are irresistible for referring the arrangement for final acceptance or rejection to Mr. Buchanan's Administration. The first of these is. that when he was himse:i a principal negotiator he did not think proper to propose an adjustment of this kind. Another is, that no British Minister is now here to receive propositions of modification, and certainly will not arnve untl after the 4th of March. The pressure of business in Congress is also too great to admit of that grave deliberation which such a subject requires. The next executive session will be of the highest importance. The whole subject of our relations with Great Bntain will come under review, and the raost profound abilities of the country wll be brought to the duty of settling them upon a foundation that will prevent the recurrence of these disputes. I have no doubt whatever that the principles of the treaty negotiated by Mr. Daalas will be confirmed, and that henceforth the kingdom of Great Britain and the republic of the United States will be firmly bound together in the ties of a common and harmonious national policy. The antagonism which demagogues imagine to exist between them is forbidden alikeby their interests andthose immortal principles of public liberty which are the basis of both Governments.'
In the Nova Scotia Legislature, on the 18th ult., the Hon. hMr. Johnson moved a resolution declaring a want of confidence in the Government. The House divided on it, and the Government were defeated by a majority of six.
The New York banks had decided upon a slight curtailment in their loans; this decision was occasioned by the reduced amount of specie in their vaults. The rate for bills on London was i to I per cent. discount. The stock-market was extremely weak - the depression extended to the best stocks. State Bonds were 5 to 17 per cent. discount for Sixes -viz.,Virginia.91 J; Missouri, 83i ; Tennessee, 89k ; Ihi aois Central shares were sold at 131 j. There were large sales of Michigan Southern Railroad shares at 74 at the first Board,but they left off at 73S. Reading Railroad shares had fallen to 784 cash; buyers, 79, at 60 days. There was a fresh movement in New York Central shares, principally at 87i to 87t for the opening. In Erie shares the only sale for cash was at 57j.; buyers at 60 days were willing to give 58 to B81. Between Boards there was a large sale of insurance scrip at 32 to 72 per cent., showing the extreme depression in this species of investment. Cotton was steady. For breadstuffs the quotations were lower. Corn was firmer. Freights were unchanged.
At New Orleans on the 17th cotton advanced Id. The sales of the day' were 9,000 bales ; middling, 121 to 12#. The receipts for the three days were 28,500 bales. Freights were dull and easier.
The War In China.
THB WAR IN CHIYA.
The following extract from a private letter dated H Hongkong, January 14," shows that apprehension existed lest the British should be overpowered by the Chinese
"Matters here are growing worse and worse, and will, I fear, continue to do so until we have a force to give the Chinamen such a thrashing as they have never yet had. I fear we must do something that will sadly shock the propriety of people at home before we can bring them to reason. Yon will judge from my Singapore letter that I am opposed to any harsh measure so long as there is a chance of gaining our point in any other way; but I fear it is now too plain that nothing else bhu the most extreme of harsh measures will bring Yeh to reason. The position at present is this-he, and he alone of all the great GovernorsGeneral in the empire, has effectually put down the rehleUion in his provinces. He and many of the people look on us in a similar light to what they do the rebels; he has exterminated one, and he has said he will exterminate the other, and thus far, if you put aside the taking of the forts, which were moatly undefended, he has gained the advantage in every instance, and at the present moment our forces are utterly paralyzed and acting only on the defensive, while the Chinese take the offensive, and that with some considerable success, in the light in which they view such affairs. They have burnt down the factories, and driven us to within 50 feet of the river. They are makingWbhampoa so unsafe that theAdmiral is abandoning it. They have taken one river steamer (the Thistle), murdered all the foreigners on board, and burnt her. They have attacked another, and nearly taken her. They came down in force on one of their forts held by us, and attacked at the same time Her Majesty's ships Comus and Hornet, stationed at the barriers, some two miles below the fort, and were with great difficulty and some loss of life driven back. They nearly took a large river steamer, the Fie Ma, she escaping only by her speed. They have taken an American cutter on her way to Hongkong, and while I am now writing fears are entertained for the safety of three river steamers that left this place five days ago for Whampoa, one of them with 40 Yankee marines on board, to tow down a lot of chops (or hulks), and have not yet arrived here. If they are safe they are at Whampoa, and dare not attempt to move till they get the convoy of some men-of-war. This is a pretty state of things for foreigners, and no wonder the Chinese think they are gaining the advantage over us. I do trust the Admiral will be able to hold his own at Canton. He has two large steamers off the town, a steamer and a brig and sloop at the Barrier, and two frigates at the Bogue. There is no fear of any regular attack proving successful, but what we have to apprehend is the Chinese burning the ships, and also-and this is the great one-blocking up the river, and thus preventing us sending provisions or ammunition. It will be an awful calamity if they do this, and they are making the attempt. Wlen the gunboats arrive I hope 'we may be able to take the offensive, and chase and destroy every junk we find inthe river.
"I am very sorry this affair was begun, but now that we have begun we must go through with it. We have no choice. We must either thrash the Cbineseso severely that they will never forget the lesson, and teach them to respect treaties and to behave to Western nations in a civil way, or make up our minds to abandon the entire empire, and with it lose a good customer of Manchester and a trade that brings into the Exchequers of Eingland and India altogether an amount but little short of 10,000,000L sterling. So I fear you havo to choose between a war and the loss of lO,000,OOOI. per annum. So long as we hold our own at Canton I don't tbink there is a chance of the troubles extending to the northern ports: but, rely on it, if we are driven away from Caiton, or attempt to conciliate them (I say attempt, for it is certain if we try to do that it will make them ten times as insolent), we shall have to wage a waragainst extermina. tion, as I am satisfied that, under such circuintansee they will drive us away from the entire empire. Remember, I don't apprehend this-not in the least,-but I am anxious you shold understand that we have no choice. We have either to conquer them entirely and dictate our own terms, or be drivon away. Therv camot be any hali-way bousew

From Jamaica we have advices to the 11th inst. Highly satisfactory accounts were received from the Wheal Jamaica Mines, showing an increase of rich ore ready for shipment, and a most encouraging and practical development of ore over the average percentage. The subject that had absorbed most attention since the sailing of the last packet was the glaring infraction of treaties for the suppression of slaveryg under the sanction of the authorities at Cuba, and encouragement given by citizens of the UTnited States. The first of a series of meetings wras held in Jamaica on Friday, the 6th inst., when the whole matter, embracing a variety of revolting details, was entered upon. Re^olutions were adopted upon which petitions are to be founded, and when signed will be forwarded for presentation to both Rouses of Parliament.
Exchanges.-On London.-Jamaica and Colonial Banks.-90 days, i per cent. pm.; 60 days, 1 per cent. pm.; 30 days, 1t per cent. pm. ; private bills at par. On New York.-Merchants' bills, 11 per cent. pm.
From Demerara we learn that since the departure of the last mail the cholera had continued its ravages throughout the colony generally, but without any increase in virulence, in Georgetown the total number of deaths reported from the 24th of January to the 7th of February amounted to 144. In the rural districts the mortality had, in some of the villages, been greater in comparison with the population than in towns, but this was attributed in a great measure to the absence of medical aid. The 11th of February had been appointed as a day of general humiliation throughout the colony n account of the epidemic. The shipping in the port continued healthy. Business was not very brisk among the merchants.
The weather at Barbadoes had been exceedingly dry during the fortnight. Mill points had been generally raised, and crop operations were active. Some sugar had been made, and one or two vessels were loading. The Corporation Bill was defunct. The United States' frigate Merrimac left Carlislebay for St. Thomas's on the 5th of Februarv, after a brilliant interchange of hospitalities with the inhabitants.
From Grenada we learn that the Lieutenant-Governor his Excellency C. H. Kortright had arrived and been duly installed in office. He was expected to meet the Legislature on the 17th. Bishop Parry had paid a pastoral visitation to this portion of his diocess, his Lordship's sojourn in the colony extend-
ing over ten days. The weather still favoured the| work of the estates.
A great deal of rain had fallen thronghout the West India Tslands generally, and in some islands had checked the sugar-grinding, especially in Trinidad; nevertheless, rain had been wanted, and the growing crops were much benefited. An average crop of sugar was expected to be realized, with the exception of the French islands Martinique and Guadaloupe, where the crop would be under the average.
Yellow fever has again broken out at Martinique, principally among the shipping.
St. Thomas's was healthy.
The latest news from the city of Mexico announces the termination of the revolution of San Luis. The President Comonfort has received the resignation of Lerdo, the Minister of Finance, and has taken upon himself the duties of that department. The Minister of Justice, Montes, is appointed Secretary of Foreign Relations, and is succeeded by Don Jose Iglesias, a Moderado, and well known to his countrymen as a writer of note. Don Jose MIaria Lafragua, late Minister of the Interior, is en rotte to the Court of Madrid, as Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary. Don Ignacio de la l]ave, Governor of Vera Cruz, and one of the supporters of the revolution of Ayutla, succeeds Lafragua. The Congress, although still hostile to Comonfort, has terminated its sittings on the new constitution with the understanding that he remains in office with the same powers until the 16th of September next. The new constitution will, it is believed, have an unwelcome reception not only from the Conservatives, but also from the Liberals, owing to the ultra-Democratic ideas of the Partido puro who framed it. The clergy are firm in their opposition to the law on church property, and maintain a factious spirit against the Government, and resort to any means to throw the Comonfort Administration into discredit with the people. A reprt had been spread by them that a treaty had been concluded with the United States ceding to them Tehuantepec or Lower California for the sum of $25,000,000. This allegation is unequivocally denied by the Government. A treaty, however, of commerce and a loan of $13,000,000 are in course of negotiation, about one-half of which loan is to be appropriated towards the liquidation of the British bondholders claims against the Mexican Government, the remaining portion to be paid into the Exchequer. One-fifth part of the duties levied on American shipping is to be hypothecated in repayment of this loan.

SOUTHAMPTON, TuESDAY EVERnm.
By the West India mail steamer Orinoco we have Panamn papers to the 8th of February.
The Pacific Steam Navigation Company's ship Bogota, Captain Wyld, arrived at Panama on the 6th, with dates from Valparaiso to the 16th of January, and Callao to the 26th, 21 passengers, and $267,000 in specie.
At Chili commerce still felt the effects of the paralyzation mentioned in the last review. There was promise of an abundant harvest. The termination of the railroad as far as Limache had shown how profitable the undertaking was to the shareholders; in March or April it will run as far as QuiUota. The floatingdock had been launched, and other public projects were in progress. The Copiapo Mines pro. mised better for the year 1857. The last advices received this year from the province were satisfactory.
In Peru the revolution was progressing, although the Vrivanco party had mnade little or no further progress to. wards gaining possession of Callao and Lima, the only two ]oints now in the hands of Castillo.
AustraHan dates zi4 Panama are to the 21st of Novemter, but have been anticipated by arrivals direct of sailing clippers.

"Gentlemen,-I have the honour to acquaint you that Her Majesty's Government have decided to mark the services rendered by yoe in the discharge of your duties in the Crimea by tendering to each of you the sum of L,fOOI.
"This s intended, not as a mere pecuniary eqnivaen'for the results of your inquiries, but to convey likewise, in the manner which appears to them most proper the recognition by Her Majesty's Government of the zeal and ablity with which those inquiries were conductod, to which LordPalmerston, in his place in Parliament, has already borne testimony.
1 have reason to believe that you have felt hurt by the omission made on my part of the usual official acknowledgment of so important a document as the report laid by you before tbe Government, I at once admit the ground of this complaint, and express my personal regret that it should have existed, but the fact was that, having accepted the report from the hands of one of the Commissioners at a personal interview, without, so far as I can trace, any formal letter accompanying it, and my mind being much occupied by important affairs at the time, I omitted that formal acknowedgment of your services which courtesy and my oown opinion of their value required.

y" Granton-house, Edinburgh, Feb. 2L
My Lord,-This evening I had the honour to receive your Lordship's letter of the 20th inst., and I beg leave to assure you that it affords me great satisfaction to be put in possession of a document containing an official acknowedgment of the services of that commission which I condcted to the Crmea two years ago. It is a source of stiU greater gratification to me to receive at the same time the thanks of Her Majesty's Government and of yonr Lordship for the manner in which those services were conducted.
" I can readily conceive how the circumstances alluded to by your Lords hip may have accidentally led to the omission of the usua official acknowledgment of the report of the Commissioners, at least until the 18th of April, when official intimation was conveyed by your directions to Colonel Tulloch, for the information of the Board at Chelsea, that there was no document at the War Department approving the report
"Your Lordship informs me that Her Majesty's Governmient have been pleased to grant me 1,0001, and you add, 'this grat is intended, not as a mere pe3nniary equivalent for the results of your inquiries, but to convey likewise, in the manner which appears to them most proper, the recogition by Her Majesty's Government of the zeal and ability with which those inquiries were conducted, to which Lord Palmerston in his place in Parliament has already borne testimony.'
" If I rightly understand this statement of tFe grounds on which the grant is tendered to mc, it means that the sum of l,000. is intended to be considered not merely as a recognition by Her Majesty's Government of the manner in Ehich the duty was performed, but likewise as the pecuniary equivalent of the results of the inquiry-that is, the money value of the advantages which the country has derived from those results.
"This estimete alone is sufficient to lead me, without further consideration, at once to decline a proposal which as explained by your Lordship, appears to me to involve the aa0on that the results of my labours have been so insignificant as to be almost without appreciable value to the public. Tho thanks which ycur Lordship has done me the honour to convey to me would have been far more acceptable if they had been unconnected with such an estimate.
"H ad it been considered expedient to adopt the course which Lord Palmerston seems to have believed was actuaUy in progress, I might perhaps have been spared the pain of formally declining what your Lordship has propased, bht tbe letter which 1Tam now answering is the first communication which I havo received upon the subject.
" Your Lordship is wel aware that I have never sought to obtain for myself any reward or remuneration. Her Najesty's Government have, till now, apparently considered my services in the commission as gratuitons, and I am quite ready as I have always been, so to consider them; I shall b amply rewarde by theconsciousness of having freely given them ata time of difficult and anxiety to the Go-ernment and to the public, but r am not prepared to forego that reward for any consideration the acceptance of which wOouald be disparaging, or forfeit the good opinion of the

' Genlemen,-It has afforded me the highest satisfaction to receive through yonr representative, Mr. Townley Parker, the address from the Mayor and nragistrates of Preston which you have done me the honour of forwarding through that channel, and I beg to assure you that this mark of your attention at a time when it is so appropriate will ever be remembered by me with the deepest gratitude.
"I regret that I cannot inform you that tho services on vhich you have placed so high an estimate, and to which such ample testimony has been borne by thePremier in Parliament, have led to those reweards to which you refer. The only proposed roecognition on the pert of HIer Majesty's Government has been in a form which I could not accept, but the highest of all rewards has been attained in the con sciousness of baving done my duty honestly and foarlessly, and that my conduct h;s met with the approbation of my countrymen.

at the Greyhound Inn, Ashover. The prisoner, who is stgl;) very lame, was seated during the examination. He was. very pert, and during the examination he askedtheConrt to. allow him to got his dinner.
)Mis Heeley, the young lady who was injured by the falli through the window, is progresedng very farourably, though not at present convalescent.

He ws just out of bed. got intohisbed to the boy whowasslepin thre.Thedoo wa focedopen, a persont entered, and Mr. iNodder fired at him. I next heard a ndroi siand craah at the windowr fronn the iroction of tho-
The pritsoner declined to ask rs. Nodder any quesThe Rev. J. Nodder.-I live at Marsh-green, and went to hed at a quarter to 12 o'clock on the night of the 20th of February. I looked round the house to see all was fe. The windows on each side the front door were closd, with bells attbched to them, The shutters to the upper.roorn windows were not closed. I was disturbed about 1 o'clock in the night by cries of "P , papa '-thieves I" I heard the cry of a man or men, "Here they are; here they are I" and a running about on the landing. I got up, and Mr&s. Nodder met me. It was dark. Sihe said, "There are thieves in the house, and I have locked thk4door." I said, "Get into bed, be calm." I reached my pistols, which wero loaded with powder and shot. I proceeded to the door in the dark, and stood close by it, hoping [ should have. a shot beforo they entered. They went on crashing until the door was forced open. I drew back to the foot of the bed and that moment the hideous figure ofa man presented itself, slided against the wall, with a candle in the left hand,
and apparently nothing in the right. I could not maywhether the face of the man was blackened, or wearing a, mask. I observed the shapo of the man's face, which had
peculiar contour; it was broad at the top and narrow at the bottom, with a cap on. I said, with a pistol in each hand
My man, 'll shootyou I" Ry wife said, " Don't shoot,"' but I shot directly at his body. The candle went out and I saw the figure swrerve to the left, and out of the door towards the landing. I head& the crash of glass, and ran to the alarm belL I went out of doors, and said, "Now we'll have you." Lihts were got, and we went to search for Miss Heeley. The window of the drawing-room was simashed, glass and framework as well, and any person might have passed into the yard. The glass in the window in Airs. Nodders room was broken, and the sash wide open. The left hand window in the entrance-halU vas open. There was a ladder outside, against Mrs. Nodder's window, against the stackyard, which was too heavy for one man to carry. Miss Eeeley gave an alarm in the village. I took my gun and pistol, and, believing the disabled man would be ao ut the premises, I went in search of him. No shot was found in the room where I fired, but some was picked up on the landing. We traced footsteps to the cart-hovel, and some stones had been put in the cart which corresponded with stones found in the yard close to the house. On Monday morning about 10 o'clock I took three men and we made a search for footsteps, and on getting into a wheatfield about 300 yards from my house I observed the footsteps of a man, and in the direction of the Chesterfield and Matlock road, and along the turnpike to a gate, there were the same footmarks I had seen in the wheatfield. I pickod up two pieces of a Birmingham newspaper and a piece of black glazed calico saturated with blood. Marriott, one of the men with me, showed me a life-preserver. Afterwards we retraced our steps to Marsh.green backwards, and traced clearly that they were the wounded footsteps of a lame person, from the impressions of one foot being much deeper then the other. We came to the point where the man had clambered up the hank, and there -we sawv pLainly the marks of feet and hands.
Thomas Ogden, butcher, Wirkswvorth.-The prisoner is the rnan I took up on the road in my cart aout half a mile from the White Horse.
The prisoner was asked to stand up.
Witness.-Oh, I know him as well stting as standing. He is the same man, and is lame of a leg.
Prisoner.-Perhaws you go by that. Witness.-I Sb V is hat.
Prisoner.-Did you seo that (pointing to his cap)? Witness.-Yes, I did.
Prisoner.-You said I had a hat on-learn to speak tho truth.
lVitness.-Tho prisoner came through a gate very lame, and put his hands on the shafts. He said, " Where are you going to ; have you been carting in the lanee' I said, "No ; we are butchers going to Chesterfield market." Prisoner said, "I wish you would tke me; IU give you 2g. 6d. if you will. I asked him for the money and he gave it me and I got him into the cart. When we got to the Slate Pit Dale Tolibar I said to the wroman, "Here is 6d. for you.' Prisoner said, "I'll pay instead of you," and he paid her. On the road I asked him what he had been doing sleeping inder the walL Prisoner said, " I have been there snce half-past II o'clock last night." Didn't you? (to prisoner.)
Prisoner.-You talk to these gentlemen; I'll ta to you another day.
Witness -I asked him what business he was. He said he was a cork hawker and had been robbed of 64 by five men and a woman, who had thrown him over the walL I said, "What quantity of corks had you ?" He said, " 80 gross."1 I said, " Why, my man, 80 gross would fill a woolsack; you could not carry them on your back." I said, " It was very 'lungus' of them to throw you over the wall after they had robbed you." I asked him where he was bound for. He said, " Sheffield." We drove him to the White Horse, at Chesterfield, where we left him.
John Hickton, a youth about 14 years of age, who was travelling to Chesterfield with Mr. Ogden, his master, in the same cart, identified the prisoner, and corroborated the last witness.
Joseph MIarriott, employed by Miss Nodder, proved accompanyin Mr. Nodder, and finding two pieces of black glazed calico stained with blood, the footmarks, and two stones near the wall where the prisoner was picked up. There were many footmarks about it, and underneath one of the stones he found a life-preserver. and a piece of a newspaper with blood upon it; also a pieoe of black glazed calico, saturated with blood.
Eliza Hole, a domnestic servant of Mr. Nodder's proved findinp a crowbar or " jemmy" on the pavement umlerneath the window which had been smashed by the burglar.
Other witnesses deposed to circumstances ten(g to ceonnect the prisoner witl the burglary. He did not make any statement or defence, and was committed for trial at the Derby assizes.
Mr. Nodder wishes to express his thanks for the numerous letters of sympathy and condolence which he has received from all parts of the country.

DESrITUTION AT COLCIESTER. In answer to Sir J. TYRELIL,
Mr. PEEL said there was no objection to lay upon the *table the report of General Gascoigne with respect to the distress among soldiers' wives at Colchester.
PERSIA.
Mr. GLADSTONE asked the Presidenit of the Board of Control whether "the financial year" in his letter of the 9th day of December last had the camne meaning as "the ensuing finanicial year" in Sir C. Trevelyan's letter of the 2d day of Deceniber last; and, if not, by whose authority the change was made; whether any estiamate of the charge of the Persian war for the ensuing financial year had been presonted by the East India Company to Hler Majesty's Government; and, if so, at what date it was thtus presented, and when it would be laid on the table of the House; and whether any supplies or mumitions of war, the property of HIer Majesty, had been despatched from this country or from any British possession in aid of the expedition against Persia?
Mr. V. SNITH said, "the financial year" in his letter meant exactly the same as "the ensuing financial year" in the letter of Sir C. Trevelyan, and it was through a mere inadvertence that any difference was made in the expres. sion. An estimate of the cbarge of the Persian war for the ensuing financial year was presented by the East India Company to the Board of Control on the 7th of February, which .estimate was submitted to Her Maiesti's Treasury on the 9th. It had not been acknowlr-dged, examined, or assented to by the Treasury, and it was z,ot his intention at present to lay it before the House, becausse he thought it would be iu'xpedient to do so. It was based upon a calculation which he heartily hoped wou'd prove to be erroneous, because it proceeded upon the assumption that -the Persian war would last till Decem,iber, 18-57. bud, independently of that which he thoi'ght was an erroneous assumption, the estimate made mention of matters which it was not advisable to lay before the House. He trusted, therefore, that the House, in the exercise of its usual discretion, would not enforce its productiojn. The last question of the right hon. gentleman was to himn (Mr. V. Smith) utterly lsiintelligible and he could only answer it by a simple negative. The right hon. gentleman iwas aware that all these expenses were first defrayed 'y the East India Company, and that they then becamie matters of account between theCompany and Her MIajesty's-Treasury. No muni-ions of war, the property of Her lajesty, had been despatched from this country in aid of the expedition against Persia. AU munitions of war in such cases were purchased by the East India Company, and whatever exp'-nse might be in-eurred by the company became matter of account between
it and the Treasury.
ARMY REGUL&TIONS-LAND TRANSPORT CORPS.
Mr. T. DUNCOMBE asked the Un-der-Secretary for War 'When the revised copy of the army regulations and orders would be ready for distribution or sale; also, what was the date of the order or authority, and to whomn it was sent and addressed, upon which the disbandment of the Land Transport Corps took place, as stated by him on Friday last ; and whether there was any objection to lay upon the table a copy of such order or authority ?
Mr. PEEL, said that the revision of the army regulations was nearly completed, and they would shortly be published. The order respecting the disbandment of the Land Trans. port Corps was dated April or May, 18.56, and the disbandment of that corps accordingly took place in August last,
IRISH WEIGHTS AND MEASURES. In answer to Sir W. VERNER,
hIr. HOPSMAN said, the Bill which he had promised to bring in for the assimilation of the weights and measures of ireland wouild be laid upon the table of the House as soon as the state of public business wouldi permit.
IRISa COURT OF EXCHEQUEP. CHAMBER.
Xr. P. 0 BitIEN asked the Attorney-General for Ireland vhether his attention had been directed to the present constitution of the Court of Exchequer Chamber in Ireland as regarded the delays aud difficulties experience,I by suitors in that court, and whether it was the ineuition of the Government to apply any remedy?
Mr. J. D. FITZGERALD said his attention had beeu directed to the subject, and he would probably ask for leave in a short tinle to introduce a Bill to assimilate the practice in the Irish Court of Exchequer Chamber to that which prevailed in England.
SIP, J. AtNE.LL AND COLONEL TULLOCH.
Mr. LAYABD asked the Under-Secretary for IVar whether there was any objection to lay on the table of the House a copy of the correspondence wvhich had passed between the Government and Sir J. R'Neill and Colonel Tulloch with reference to the offer of 1,0001. which was made to tho-se gentlemen?
Mr. PEEL-There is no objection to produce the correspondence.
POSTPONEIENT OF ORDERS AND NOTICES.
On the in ,tion of Mr. HORS.nAN, the orders of the day were postpouned in order to permit the resumption of the debate on the hostilities against China.
Lord PALMIERSTON moved, with the same object, that the notices of mziotions should b3 postponed.
Mr. DUNCOMBE said he hoped th&t before the motion "was agreed t- the Under-Secretary forWar would give him a moro explicit answer to the questions which he had already asked with regard to the army regulations and the Land Transport Cops. The orders and regulations were at present in abeyance, and officers of the army could not obtaintheben. Ee was anxious the order disbanding the Land Transport Corps should be laid upon the table, because he believed that it was altogether illegal.
Sir J. FEIIGUSSON said that a great many very deserving "flicers of the Land Transport Corps had suffered what they b-lieved to be great injustice, and he hoped that the hon. geptleman the Under Secretary for WVar would give more definite answers to these questions.
hr. F. PEEL said that it was intended in future to apply the Queen'3 regulations to the artillery aud engineer corps as well as to other branches of the service. The revision and adaptation of the order to this purpose were a work which required great care. It had, however, been completed, except as to that portion which related to the einbarcation of troops. As soon as that was finished the publication would take ulace. With regerd to tbe Land Transport Corps, as thehon. member forFinsbury (3r. T. Dauncombe) h a motiou upon the paper, it was needless for him to enter into the circumstances of the reduction. He would only say thst it took place in accordance with instructions from the War Department, and not under the order in -Council.
The motion was then agreed to.
THE WAR IN CHINA.
THE ADJOURNED DEBATE.
The order of the day for the resumption of the adjourned debate on the subject of the hostilities in China having been read,
Mr. ROUNDELL PALMER said that his hon. friend tne mnember for the West Riding had taken a wise and judi-Ceoas course in not calling upon the Hlouse to express any topinion as to whether the Chinese had now or at any former time been guilty of any defaults in the performance of their -treaties witth this country which would have justified theadop. -tion of other meaus of redress, or the making of other complaints than those which had beeni adopted and made in this
instance. If it was proved to demonstration that in the -affair of the Arrow the Chinese Governument was more or less wrong, aud that there vwas matter for remonstrance and complaint, that would be far from justifying the kind and -tone of the reinonstrances which were made, and the perseverance in th-7so complaints, with the addition of new desmands, after a redress whica_he trusted the House would think was adequate to the occaLi.,n bad been offered. <Hear, hear.) On the other hand, however, it was absolutely niecessary to the case of the Government that they should. clearly make out that the Chinese had been guilty of a deliberate violation of their treaty with Great Britain. (Hear, hear.) His right hon. friend the Home-iscretary bad, towards the conclusion of his able and -cloque;t speech-in which, however, ha entirely gave the go-by to the substantial merits of the question (hear, hear)said that he declined to enter upon the technicalities of the legal question. According to his (MIr. Palmer's) view of t,he matter, it was absolutely necessary for the Government to prove themselves right as to the question of law, in order to establish the least justification for the course which they had sanctioned and approved. How stood t,he matter according to the showing of the Government themselves ? His hon. and learned friend the Attorney-General had discarde I the arguments which had been founded upon the coloni 1 ordinance, and upon the Acts of the Imperial Parliament, and ad said-and he (Ur. Palmer) concurred in that amer.
tion-that the treeaty must determine between China andGreat Britain whether there was any cause for the reprisals which had been made by the latter Power. HIn hon. and. leanedl friend said that if it were not for this treaty the Arrow, or any other merchant ship at Canton, was liable to be visited by the Chinese auxthorities. in saying this he only repeated what was said by Lord Wensleydale, as high a legal authority as anty, in another place. The words of that noble lord -were these -.
"If it was then in the port of Canton, withini the territorial bounds of China, the Chinese had undoubted authority to seize criminals breaking their laws on board the ship i
this port, as weoll as on their own territory, and we had no right to treat the seizure, as a wrong dione to us, unless the Chinese had by treaty 3greed to give us the right."
Then, what became of the declaniation about the British flag,
Lunless it couldl be made out that by the terms of this treaty the Chinese had agreed to take the British flag, when hoisted by any vessel, as conclusive evidence of the nationality of the vessel hoisting it? (Hear, hear.) It was admitted byv the Attorney- Ge.eral and by the highest legal authorities elsewhere thatithe Britishi flag by itsel.f was wholly irrelevanit to the question, and that the hoarding of a vessel bearing such a flag for the purpose for which the Arrow was boarded was no violation of the law of nations, tunless the Emperor of Chinia had by this treaty conitracted himself out of the right to exercise what would otherwise he his undoubted privilege. The Governmnent, then. maust make out that the Arrow was an English ruerchant ship, within Ihie terms of this treat.v If they failed to do thatt, there was no justification for ;;ny part of the hostilities in which we were engaged. Some hon. gentlemen had said-hut to do him justice this aTguxment wyas not repeated by the AttorneyG-ent-ral---that the Chinese had nothing to do hut to lookat this ship to see that she was a British vessel;, she was a loreha, all lorchas were English, therefore this lorcha was an English vessel, anid therefore the Chinese in boardin
alorchia must have kniown that she was an English vesse. Were the-re no Portuguese and no Danish lorebas No lorchas belonging to Chiniese insurgent-s or pirates? Why, the papers showed that this very lorcha, at one timne in her history att least, belonged to Chinese pirates, anid thierefore an argument miore preposterous than that because this vessel was a lorcha, crge it mnust bave been British in the sense of the treaty probably never entered thle mind of mnan. That, however, 'was niot the argumient of the Attorlney-General. That honi. anid learned gentleman said that the sailing letter or register clearly miade the Arrow a Brithis ~hip-that the 1-th article of the treaty required ev ery British schoonier, lorchia, cutter, &c., to hiave a sailing le ttr or register in Engli.,h and Chinese, under the seal and s,ignature of the Chief Superintendent of Trade. This was very true ; buit the hon. *,nd learned gentleman contended that ever lorcha receiving such a sailing letter or registe.r was by the very letter and conditions of that treaty coaiverted into a British lorcha, and entitled otothe character and psrivileges of a British vessel. The bon. ard learned gentleman had earned miany distinctions while at the University of Oxford, and did he forget that a hook called Aid7rihe's Xorjic was used at that seat of learning ? If the hon. and learned gentlemian, when at the sob nola of Oxford, had proposed as an example of sound logic that because every Britishi lorcha miust have a British sailing letter or register, therefore every lorcha havinz a sailing letter or register must be British, he could haidly have carried off the highi bonours which he had won there. He (Mr. Palmier) woud venture to put the proposition in a shape that coul scarely be mnists -en :--"Every member ofte Ho,sse of CommTons must take the oaths of allegiance and suprenmacy ; therefore everybody who too], the oaths of allegiance and supremacy was a member of the House of Commons." (Laughter ;nd cheers.) No doubt, a British lorchia w~ithout a sailing leiter or register was not entitled to protection, and he should inquire by and by whether this lordha had one in the mneaning of the treaty. The Attorney-General, however, had relied upon another argumnent, which deserved greater weight. He had endeavouared to snake out that this ship must have been British because the person to whomi it belonged was a Chinamau residing at Hongkong. In this partof the subject he had been anticipated by the hon. and learned genitleman the memnber for Stan,ford (Sir F. Thesiger); yet he would examine it briefly in the light of the treaty itself ; because there could be no greater fallacy than to apply mnere abstract pr'Incpe of construction to the interpretation of such a aocument. The first and governing words of the 17th article, to whiclh the Attorney-General advex ted, were " varioiis small vessels bele-sging to the English nation." Here there was nothing ab, ut British subjects, to introduce nice technical argun,ents as to how many kinds of British subjects there were, neither w,as there anything about British citszens. The nationiality of thevessels was pointed out, and not the temporary subjer,tship of the persons owning them, who mnight not sb,are in that nationality. The nationality of a ship could he Fniglisa in one of two ways only-either her ownershiip wvould malke her so, or the chiaracter of the ship itself must be English. The Attorney-General held that the ownership of a person residing at Hougliong, being a Chinese, and OuinR allegiance to tlaeEn,perorof China, miade her British. If ti,at argumnent was true, of courae the principle of it would apply throughout the treaty; and they miust adopt thje same rule of interpretationi to-the other p arts of the treaty. Well, would a vessel belonging to an EInglishman, se!tltld for the purposes of trade at Canton or at Shanghai, he a Chinese vessel within the meaning of the treaty ? If the c woer's residence at Honglkong made the vessel of a Chinamani an Englishi vessel; so the residence of an English o-ntr at Cant-on or Shanghai would make hsis vesse a Chinese one. Everybody saw how monstrous it was tosa
that ships belonging to Engli-shmen, resident he cared not how mtany years at Canton or at any other Chinese port, wveme not in the sense of the treaty English ships, and as such entitled to English prtection. Moreover, if Chinese shipowners living' at Woongkong were British subjects entitled to the protection of the treaty, then all the obligations and duties imposed by the treaty on the same class of persons applied reciprocally to such shipowners and such ships. According to this principle of initerpretation, under the fourth article of the treaty these Chinese shipowners residenit at Hongkong would no-t be allowed to trade at any Chinese ports, except FooLIhow, Any,igp, and Shanghai, neither shoul.a they repair to any te ot or places, nor wouldthe Chinese people at any yothe oportsbe emte otaewt hm h
infringemnent of these restrictions rendered the vessels and cargoes liable to confiscation by the Chinese authorities. 'Would it, then, he gravely maintained that because a Chinese owner, owing allegiance to his own Government, lived at HoIngkong hiis jnehis lorcha (for the two clawses of vessels were all one to the sense of the treaty) would not he permitted to go to any Chinese port except the four albove-named, and that we should be guilty of a breach of the treaty if we did not endeavour to preveiit it? The sixth article of the treaty precluded English merchants and others residinig at, or resorting to, the five ports from going into the surrouniding couintry beyondl certain short distances, to be named by the local authorities, in concert with the British Consul ; and it also decla-red that persons fid.ringing this artiele should be seized andl handed over to our consul for suitable puniishment. Shouild we, then. be guilty of a violation of the treaty if we allowed such Chinamien as tise crew of the Arrow to go intbo their own country? it waeclear that this article pointed to English nationality, properly so called; and was wlsolly repugnant to the notion ti at by residence at Hoiiglkong subjects of the Emiperor of (hbina could be converted into Englishmnen. If -we attemnptedI to do this we should manifestly bring these persons under the disabilities as well as confer on them the privileges of theo treaty-a thing which we could have no power to do, and whichl we never meant to undertake. The blue-books showe,l that tse Chinese residents at Hongkong were a turbulenlt race, nearly allied to the insurgents and the secret societies in feeling ; and if we were to be made responsible for their note when they were not actually at Hongkong it was mnost essentia that we should lock narrowly at the obligations we undertook in regard to thbrn. The first treaty was muade in 1842, for the cession of Honkong. The supplementary trea ty was concluded in 1845, and before the settlement of llougkong was effeceWd. The third article of the first treaty declared that Hongkong was ceded to us by China, becanse we required a port in which our shipping could careen and refit. That being so, would it not he a fraud towards the Chinese under this treaty to create a depO3t at the place thus ceded to uis in whichi Chinese subjects maight, ad libituma, be turned into Englishmen, and in which you should invent in favour of an indefinite class of Chinse shipo privileges that were intended for English shipsonly? The 17th article of the sup-
tleentrytretyshowed that the uae which existed efr ogkong was ceded, and while the whole of the British trade was necessarily carried on in sliips belonging to the British nation, was contemplated by the stipulations bearing on this question. Suppose that when we ratified the independence of the
Unte States, and entered into a commercial treaty with them, we bad ceded to them, in order to give their vessels greater facilities for careening, refitting, and taking in stores, sonic small islanid off our coast-say the island of Arran, near Glasgow-and hadl agreed that no English offender should be taken off Asnerican vessels entering the harbour of Glnsow without counniunicati on with their consul, would aniy judge of any court in this country hiold that small ves-sels belonging to Glasgow anoen who had gone to theislWe of Arran to make imoney by dealing with the Americans there were American ships, and were entitled to the privi1' ges granted to vessels entering the port of Glasgow belonging to the Amierican nation? (Hear.) Would it niot be asked wvhat it wvas whzich muade these vessels Amierican ships ? Would it be held for a momenit that the owners by simpnly
goig-t toe isle- 0-1 Ara,adsaig hr o vi
going to the Isle of Arran, and staying there for ever so short a time, became immediately invested with American nationality? How ridiculous and absurd such a proposition would be ! (Hear, hear.) How could the ships of such persons be American ships unless they were recognized by the superior Imperial authority of the United States as being possessed of general American nationality ? (Hear, hear.) This brought him to the consideration of the argments derived by the Attorney General from the decision whicls had been given in the cases arising under the American treaty. H-e had not understood his hon. and learned friendl the othr evening as speaking -with any disrespect of what had fallen from Lord Lyidbhurstin another place (hear), but quite the reverse. Neither had he understood his hon. and learned friend to speak of the omi-eson of any reference by Lord Lyndhurst to the case of "MIarsiott s. Wilson," in the language which had been represented as falling from him by the hon, and learned memberdfor Stamford. The Attorney-Gcneral, he thought, said on Friday night that Lord Lyndhurst had in sorLe way heich he could not explain omitted to advert to that decision.
The ATTOlhNEY-GLXERAL-~What I said did not refer particularly to Lord Lyndhurst, but was meant generall. I expresaed my surprise ththathat partiular case had been overlooked altogether in the debate.
Mr. PALMEn .-That was quito consistent with the remark htich he had to make on thisuc parentomission. The reason thy the noble and thatred lords whoo took so prominent a part in the debata ~iL the otber House-the T,ord Chancellor andi Lord Weasleydale on One aide, and Lo>rd Lyadhurs-t and Lord Sk~ ).eonard's on the other-had not mentioned this case, with which they were, of course, p>erfectly familiar, probabib waa thlat they were of opinioa that it had nothing whMiesrm to do with the question 'laughter), and, fortitia hiuas..f with such high sauthorit
he wras obliged, to .ssz b~ that opoiniorn ws sie ai
weary the House b, quoting the words of Consl Parkes en that subject. here is no 'doubt about their meanin. They have been cited over and over again in this debate
He undoubtedly confesses in these documents that the case of the Arrow is satisfied; and you are now, in point of fact, engaged, as I wil show, in bombarding and burning a city n order that your envoy may enter within it. My right lon. friend the Secretary of State for the Colonies made a complaint on the part of Her Majesty's Government that gentlomen were irreverently in the habit of speaking of the war in China. He said there is no war in China. I agree with him; there is not war in China.
Mr. LABOUCHERE.-With China.
Mr. GLA.DSTONB.-I thank my right hon. friend foe at correction. There is not war with China. No, Sir, there is not war with China, but what is there? There is hostility. There is bloodshed. There is a trampling down o the weak by the strong. There is the terrible and abominable retaliation of the weak upon the strong. (Hear, hear. ) Yen are now voccupied in this Rouse by revolting and
harrowng details about a Chinese baker who poisoned bread, by proclamations for the capture of British heads, and the waylaying Of a postal steamer. And these things you think strengthen your case. Why, they deppen your guilt. (Loud cheers.) War taken at the best is a frightful scourge to the human race, but because it is so the wisdom of ages has surrounded it with strict laws and usages, and has required formnalities to be observed which shall act as a curb upon the wild passions of man, to prevent that scourge from being iev loose unless under circumstances of full deliberation and from absolute necessity. (Hear, hear.) You have dispensed with all these precautions. (Cheers.) You have turned a consul into a diplomatist, and that metamorphosed consul is forsooth to be at liberty to direct the whole might of England against the head of a defenceless people. (Cheers.) While war is a scourge and curse to man it is yet attended with certain compensations. It is attended with acts of heroic self-sacrifice and of unbounded daring. It is ennobled by a consciousness that you are nieeting equals in the field, and that vhile you chaUenge the issue of life or death you at least enter into a fair encounter. ( Hear, hear.) Bnt you go to China and make war npon those who stand before you as women or children. (Cheers.) They try to resist you; they call together their troops; they load their guns; they kill one and wound another in action, but while they are doing so you perha s slay thousands. They are unable to 'meet you in the field. You have no equality of ground on which to meet them. You can ear no glory in such warfare. (Loud cheers.) Andit is those who put the British flag to such uses that I stain it. (Cheers.) It is not from them that we are
to hear rhetorical exaggerations on the subject of the allegiance that we owe it. Such is the case of the war in China. And what do these people who are as mere women and children do when you make war with them ? They resort to those miserable and detestable contrivances which their weakness teaches them. (Hear, hear.) It is not the first time in the history of the world. Have you never read of those rebellions of the slaves which have risen to the dignity of being caled wars, and which stand recorded in history as the servile wars? And is it not notorious that among all the wars upon record those have been the most terrible, ferocious, and destructive? And why? Because those who have been trampled upon adopt in their turn the practices of their oppressors. And that is the character of the war which we are prosecuting in China. Every account that we shaU read in the journals or hear recited in this House wil tell of calamity heaped upon calamity, and of cruelty heaped upon cruelty.. The hon. member for Cornwal eulogized the humane manner in which our forces threw cannon bals into Canton at moderate intervals. (Laughter.) I have received a letter, dated the 14th of January, which has not been published in the journals, and therefore I trust the House will attend to it
as it is written by one of our officers and shows the real character of our operations against China. He says*-
" On Monday morning, at daylight, fire parties were told off from the Encounter, Barracouta, Niger, the 59th, and, last not least, the Dutch Foly. The orders were to advance as near as possible to the city wall, and all the suburbs from Shamen Fort down to the Dutch Folly were to be burnt. This was well accomplished, and by 9 o'clock there was a tremendous conflagration, having been fired in so n,any places. The naval, I am glad to say, had no casualties. Not so the 59th; they had what I consider a severe loss-two kiled, 11 seriously and two slightly wounded; - had a narrow escape, as also one of our fire party. They were suprised and nearly cut off by a hundred and more men, but the revolvers and cutlasess told wel, and they rushed clear. We then commenced 'carcasses' and ,irebaUs from the Folly into the city, and got up a tremendous fire, which was much aided by a very strongbreeze, which blew aU day, and they only got the fire under in the city about noon on Tuesday. It must have done great damage. The entire suburbs from Shameen Fort to 400 yards beyond this fort in the French Folly direction is now a mass of ruins."
Sir, that is the state of things that existed on the 14th of January. That is the state of things to which, as early as circumstances permit, but, unhappily, I fear, too late, the wisdom aud firmness of Parliament have been called upon to apply a remtdy; and, now, when this matter has been discussed, when the cause has been sustained by learning, eloquence, zeal, and feeling, worthy as relates to the other House of Parliament, and worthy as relates to some portion of the debate in this House, of the best das of Parliamentary history, that which caUs itself worldly wisdom steps in and warns us against the exercise of the authority of Parliament in putting a check upon these pro. eeedings. We are told to take care what we are about. We are told to support our representatives; but we have swept away the rubbish which has been talked with respect to Sir J. Bowring. We have gob so far in the consideration of this question that we are not dealing judicially with Sir J. Bowring. As far as we are dealing with persons at aU, it is with the Government by whom these proceedings have been approved that we are now dealing ; but we are dealing much more with the vast interests of humanity which are at stake, and with respect to which we are told that they, and they alone, ought to guide us. Bat we are told to beware of an adverse vote of the House of Commons. We are told to consider the effect of such a vote upon the Chinese. We are told to consider the ruinous consequences to our trade. We are asked if we wish to extend the ruinous conflagration which has broken out, and to injare those interestsof humanity'whicb,itis ourduty toassert. That is the argument, and I will make this concession to those who use it. Our last acoceunts from China arc up to the middle of January, and we are now in the 3d of March. No human wisdom can tell, and J, for one, am not bold enough to conjecture, what mayhappen within the three months that have elapsed from the date of the last advices, and before the decision of Parliament can reach China. But, Sir, I must say that if I look to the continuation of the influences that have been at work there can be niothing darker than the prospect beforeus(chee:s) and r, foroee, shouldhavenutthesmaUest hope. You amu ed us with the story that the population of
anton were rising again t the authorities. On the contrary, we are now assured by contrary a-counts that the populace are arming to a man to do their best, I will not say to fight; hut to expose themselves and to die in the quarrel into which they have been forced. But of all the cases in which warlike operations were ever begun I do not know of any in which -the political problem to he solved was so SimpIe What do we want from the Chinese? (Hear, hear.) They are not naking war on us. I when the vote of this Parlia. iment goes to Cbina they should be making war on us that would be a very different matter. But there is nothing so improbable as that they should make war on us. They have never shown any skill or daring in the nature of aggressive op,erations. We are making warnupon them, and for what are we making'war? (Hear.) Whatareweaskingfromthe Chinese? Sir J. Bowring has proposed our entrance into Canton, but the Government have never told us that this is an adequate cause for the war. (Hear.) They have never told us even that they consider our entrance into Canton desirable. (Hear, hear.) It is impossible for me to say whether it is desirable, but I own I lean to the opinion of Yeh, the Chinese Commissioner, and that I am incined to believe that our entrance into Canton, if it were conceded, would be more mischievous than beneficiaL I, for one, therefore. see no reason why we should make war for the purpoEe of obtainng a thing which, so far from being desirable, is likely to be mischievous. Sir, there never was a case in which the solution of the political problem was so simnple, for the actual state of war has never been constituted. This is a happy thing. I might almost s %y it is,a providential circumstance, if we consider it in regard to the solution of the difficulty. The state of war has not been regularly and legaUy constituted, and that freedom which we now possess for correcting te proposals of our agents would have been lost if war had been' regularly and formally declared. But, Sir, I am not content with that miode of dealing with such an argument. I find an appeal has been made to this House which appears to me to be a false and ilegitimate appeal. It is an appeal to fear (cheers), which is seldom a rightful and noble sentiment, and it is to that fear which is the basis of the worst kind of fear-the fear of being thought afraid. (IIear.) The Government are afraid of the mischievous impression that will be produced upon the Chinese if the acts of our officials are disavowed. Sir, let us consider fairly, impartially, and at large the moral impressions that must be produced. Let us weigh the evil upon one side and the other, and I have no fear of the result. Hereafter we shall be told by the noble lord of the wise caution that we ought to display, of the solemn predicament in which we are placed, of the political mischief which may ensue. Shadowy pictures will be drawn of the dangers, the confusion, the weakness, and the paralysis of British power iu theEast. Bu,t

whnat is the foundation of the promise to bepermanaeat and useful of that Britieh power? It is not now a question as if the Chinese are alone concerned, for the debate has been prolonged night after night, and your words hayb gone through out the whole earth. The confessions and avowals of the supporters of the Government have heef, it appears to me, perfectly fatal either to the continuance of that
olicy or else to the character and fame of England. Lou ches)Talk of the consequences, and talk of inJUstice, and then say that we must go on with that injustice. (Cheers.) When you spieak of the necessity of applying the law of force to the Chineso, and that it is by
force that your inluence must spread, I am bound to admit, and I do admit, that you have not power to prevent the language of this debate from being read. The opponents of the resolution of my hen, friend have not generally ascended to that height of boldness. Few have justified the proceeding3 that havetaken place. I heard the speech of the lion. and learned member for Hertford, but I did not understand that he approved them. (Hear.) I hsard the speech of my hon. and learned friend the Attorney-General, but I thought he eschewed that portion of the case. (Hear, hear.) I doubt whether my right hon. friend the Secretary of State for the Home Dopartment justified the proceedinzs. (#ear, hear.) Many of those who intend to support the movernment have openly condemned the proceedings that have talcen place. The hon. gentleman the member for Cornwall condemns them. The hon. member for Norfolk condemns them, Members. more than I could name have condemned the proceedings. Iwillaic what the effect will be throughout the world if it goes forth that in the debates held in the two Houses of Parliament the majority of speakcers condemned the proceedin, and that even among those who sustained the Government with their vote there wss a large number vho condemned those ptoeeedinga.~ 'Why, Sir, the opinion will be that England S a Power which, whle it is ier and moie darming in its
pretensions to Christianity than any other Power on tho face of the globe, yet that in a case where her own interests were concerned, and where she was acting in the remote and distant East, when fairly put to it and asked whether she would do right or wrong, she was ready to adopt for fear of political incon *emience the princplc-" I wilnmake the law of wrong the law of my Eastern policy, and will lay the foundation of that empire which is my proudest boast in nothing more norless than gross injustice." (Cheers.) Sir, this is not my opinion. I will not believe that ilngland wiUl ay the foundations of its Eastern empire on such miserable ground as this. I Felieve, on the contrary, that if you have the courage to assert your prerogative as the British House of Commons, you will pursue a course which is more consistent with sound policy as well as the eternal principles of justice. (Cheers.) Sir, how stands the case at present? I have just nor suprosed that the House are going to affirm that resolution which will be the seal of our disgrace. But let me reverse the picture and suppose that the House wiU adopt the resolution, and then what will the House do, and what will be the history oF this case ? Its history wil read well for England and for the 19th century. (Cheers.) Its history will, then, be this,-The subordinate officers of England, in a remote quarter of the globe, misconstrued the intentions of their country; they acted in violation of the principle of right; the Executive Government failed to check them. The appeal was next made to the House of Lords, anid made as guoh an appeal ought to be made, for the House was worthy of the eloquence and the eloquence was worthy of the cause. It was made to nobles and it was made to bishops, and it failed. (Loud cheers.) But it does not rest with subordinate functionaries abroad, it does not rest with the Execative Government, it does not rest with the House of Lords, finaly, and in the last resort, to say what shall be the policy of England and to what purpose shaU her power be directed. (Cheers.) S' r, that function lies within these walls. Every memberof the House of Commons is proudly conscious that he belongs to an assembly which in itg collective capacity is the paramount power of the State. (Hear, hear.) But if it is the par-, mount power of the State it can never separate from that paramoont power a similar and paramount responsibility. The vote of the House of Lords will not acquit us ; the sentence of the Government will not acguit us. It is with us that it lies to detersaine whether this wrong shaU remain unchecked and uncorrected, and in a time when Eentiments are so much divided, every man I trust, will give his vote with the recollection and the consciousness that it may depend upon his single vote whether the miseries, the crimes, the atrocities that I fear are now proceeding in China are to be discountenanced or not. (Hear, hear.) We have now come to the crisis of the case. England is not yet committed. But if an adverse division rejectthemotion of my hon. friend to.morrow morning England wll have boeen committed. (HWear, hear.) With every one of usit rests to showthat this House, which is the first, the most ancient, and the noblest temple of freedom in the world, is also the temple of that everlasting justice without which freedom itself would be only a name or only a curse to mankind. And, Sir, I cherish the trust and belief that when you rise in your place to-night to declare the numbers of the division from the chair which you adorn the words which you speak will go forth from the walls of the House of Commons s a message of mercy and peace, but also as a message of prudence and true wis dom, tothe farthest cornersof the vorld. Therighthon.gentleman resumed his seat amid loud cheering, which was continued for several minutes.
Mr. BENTINTK.-I rise to explain. (Cries of "ISpoke !") I will not detain the House one moment. The right hon. gentleman who has just addressed the House, in adverting to some remarks which I made at an early stage of this debate, stated that I had preferred a charge &aFanst him of doing allthatwas avileand base. ("No, no I') I sounder. stood the right hon. gentleman. What I did say was this. I stated that the right hon. gentleman and his friends had been for some years past associated with all the anti-Pro. testant.-(Loud cries of " Question.") The House wiU permit me to state that what I did say was this-that the right hon. gentleman and his friends had for some years past been associated with all anti-Protestant-(The loud cries of "Question" which were repeated drowned the remainder of the sentence.)
Lord PALMIERSTON was cheered on rising. He said,I confess, Mr. Speaker, that from a gentleman possessing the talents and experience of the hon. member for the West Riding of Yorkshire-from a gentleman whose private and personal character stands so high in the estimation of those who know him-I should not have expected such a motion as he has made, or such a speech as that with which he has Introduced it. The motion has been explained by my right hon. friend the Secretary of State for the Colonies as a motion contradictory in itself; as a motion fatling short of the object-for it is no use to conceal a fact sowell understood-to which it is directed; as a motion caling upon the House to abstain from inqu iring into the grounds on which the Chinese have afforded cause of complaint, and yet foUowing it up with a resolution that condemns the measures taken to redressthe wrongs of which theyhavebeen guilty. The hon. gentleman talked of the logic of the Chinese before the days of Aristotle. If he had studied either the logic of the Chinese or the days of Aristotle, I think he would have formed la better opinion. (A. laugh.) He has also commented on the morals of the Chinese. I think it would have been better for his morals if he had abstained from those comments. ( " Oh !") The question was beltween Sir J. Bowring on the one hand, and Yeh on the other. Now, Sir J. Bowvring he stated was an intimate friend of his of 20 years' standing. We know Sir J. Bowring was the associate of the hon. gentleman in that career of public usefulness forwhich the name of the hon. gentleman wil go down to posterity, and in which he laboured to introduce improvements into our commercial system. What has happened since the hon. gentleman and Sir 3. Bowring parted that the hon. gentleman should disclaim any vindictive feeling against Sir J. Bowring? What injury has Sir J. Bowring done to the hon. gentleman that he should forget the ties which formerly bound them? My notion of a friend of 20 years' standing Is to view his faults with indulgence, to make excuse, if excuse can be made, for any error that he has committed, and not for the purpose of correcting a first fault to come down with all that bitterness of attack which only a private enemy can be supposed to feel. (Hear, hear.) Who is Sir J. Bowring, and how came he in the situation which he holds? Does ho owe his situation to aristocratic influence, which we are told is so often the cause of promotion in the public service? Was;he a member of that aristocracy which some people wish to banish from public employment ? Sir J. Bowring was essentially a man of the people. He has raised himself to the situation which he holds by his talents, by his attainments, by his industry, by his public service. He was selected for the first appointment which he received as consul at Canton when I was Secretary of State for the Foreign Department. I was led to make that choice because i had watched Sir J. Bowring in his former career. He had been employed in commercial negotiations in Paris. He had distiguished himself by his eminent knowledge of commercial matters. He was a man of great talents, of varied attainments, and euilnently fitted for the situation. Then ame a vacancy in the office of plenipotentiary and superintendent of trade at Hongkong. My noble friend Lord Clarendon promoted him from the office of consul at Canton to that appointment simply on his own authority. My noble friend, undoubtedly, consulted me, as having more knowledge of Sir J. Bowring, although he had been associated with my noble friend in commercial negotiations at Paris, and he had had experience of his talonts. But he did consult, also, the head of the Government; and, although the right hon. gentleman who gpoke last may endeavour to throw off f om Lord Aberdeen any responsibility, if any there be in that selection, yet I hold in my hand a letter, which I am authorized to read, which shows that Lord Aberdeen as,ented to and approved Sir 3. Bowrnngs appointment. This Is the letter. It is dated September:-
" I am not very weU acquainted with Dr. Bowring and I think I have never had anything to do with him officially. (Derisive cheers from the Opposition.) Bat he is evidently a clever man, and has acquired such a knowledge of China as must give him great advantages, so that you cannot probably find a better man."
Then I say that it is in vain for the right hon. gentleman the member for the University of Oxford, aad for his right hon. friend the member for Carlisle, to say that the Government of which they were members had no share in the responsibility of the appointment of Sir J. Bowring. I do not say that that appointment requires defence. I
tbink that Sir J. Bowring was a fit person for this situation, and that Lord Aberdeen and Lord Clarendon showed both their discrimination and their sense of justice in transferrlng
him to a post which his previous experience at Canton had I cculiarly fitted him to hold. What is this other man who bas been made tho subject of panegyric, and whose productions have been praised at the expense of those of our own c fficers ? What is the character of this Yeh ? He is one cf the most savage barbarians that ever disgraced a nation. He has been guilty of every crime which can degrade and debase human nature. In the contest between these two men, it is somewhat extraordinary that partiality should turn rather towards thisbarbarian than towards the British representative. We have heard much of the meddling spirit of Sir J. Bowning, which, it has been said, has made him reckless of the consequences of his actions. Why, Sir
3. Bowring was, as we inow, a member of the Peace Society. (" Hear," and cheers.) He was distinguished for his amiable qualities and for the mildnems of his disposition; and I should say that if there be one man less likely than an-
otherto engage the country which he represents in hostilities. that man is Sir 3. Bowring. I know that I have on former occasions said that no men are so pugnacious as the members of the Peace Society, and, no doubt, if some other members of that society had been in Sir J. Bowring's place they would soon have im olved us in serious difficulties. (Laughter.) I noticed with great padn the tenour and tone
oFihe speech of the hon. momber for the West Riding, because there pervaded the whole of it an anti-English feeling (cheers), an abnegation of all those ties thlch bind men to their ountry and to their fellow-countrymen, whicA I should hardly have expected to have found in a apeech of the bon. member. Everything that was English wa3
own. (Hear ) In the first place, that decioson turned not upon the abstract and general question, but on the meaning Cf the particular words, "vessels beloDging to citizens of the United States of America," in the 13th article of the treaty of commerce. It was the case of a man who had been living for 20 years in the United States of Anerica, who was settled there with his family, who had been natnrali7-ed and admitted as a citizen according to the lawof the United States, who had taken the oath of allegiance, and wlo in America had every right of citizenship. He was also a natural born subject of this country, and the Court said, "If we by treaty and by Act of Parliament have given to vessels belonging to citizens of the United States certain rights and privifeges, and if it is as clear as daylght that this man is a citizen of the United States, and w,e have not said in the treaty that cilizens of the UJnited States who are also natural bom subjects of the British Crown shall lose those rights, why should lie not possess them 7" The argument appeared perfectly clear, nor was there much doubt about it at the time. There was another point incidentally touched upon, but not decided, bearing on the interpretation of the word " subject" on which Lord Eldon, Lord Stowell, and Lord Redesdale expressed a different opinion, and had held that a person similarly circumstanced was not to be regarded as an American sulject when he came to this country. That opinion was not overrnled, but considerable doubt was cast upon it bythedecisionin thecase. Bnt "citizens" or " subjects" had nothing to do with this question. (Hear, hear.) The point to be decided was, did the ship belong to the English nation ? It was clearly not a public vessel, nor was it the property of any nerson belonging to the EDglish nation. Its owner had not been naturalized. It was not seriously contended that he had been domiciled, and lie had done nothing whatever to clothe himself with the rights of British citizenship. (Hear.) Going back to the case which he had put of the Isle of Arran, what wiould the judge say if, because certain rights had been ceded to .'on. fdc American citizens residing on the mainland of the United States, any Scotchman who bad been to the Isle of Arras for a short time and traded with the persons residing there, who was in reality no more an American citizen than any member of that House, were to claim the right of taking a vessel from Arran, and of trading within thelimits (f the j'irisdictionof theEastlndiaCompany? The cases were exactly parallel. Tbere was no pretence whatever for the assertion that the accidental residence of a Chinese subject within the limits of Hongkong gave him a right to protection on the score of British ownership. (l:Iear.) If it was not on the score of ownership, on what other ground could this vessel claim the rights of British nationality ? To give a ship a national character the national authority mnust be impressed upon it, and it was clear that that had not been done in this case, unless by the colonial ordinance; and even assuniing the ordinance ta be valid, it seemed plain that in this case it did not confer any rights at al. If the ordinance bad any force to make a Chinese vessel a British vessel it could only be while it was operative, but the moment it failed, il the ship was not a British ship without it, there was an end of the nationality The 17th article of the supplementary treaty laid down
" 1. That every British schooner, catter, lorcha, &c., shall have a sailing letter or register in Chinese and English, under the seal and signature of the chief superintendent of trade, describing her appearance, burden, &c.
"2. That every schooner, lorcha, and such vessel shall report herself, as large vessels are required to do, at the Bocca Tigris, and when she carries cargo she shall also repost herself at Whampoa, and shall on reaching Canton deliver up her sailing letter or register to the Britirh Consul, who will obtain permission from the hoppo for her to dischare her cargo
".Wben the inward cargo is discnarged and an outward one, if intended, on board, and the duties on both arranged and paid, the consul will restore the sailing letter or register and allow the vessel to depart."
It was a remarkable fact that throughout these papers there was no ixtimation that the Arrow ever had discharged her cargo or that her sailing letters had ever been con municated to the Chinese authorities, or that their permission had ever been obtained for the unloading of her cargo. He would venture to say that none of these things, which ought to have been done had she been a vessel entitled to British protection, had been done; and for two reasons. If she had paid the duty it would have been stated in the papers, because it would have fixed the Chinese with a conclusive knowledge of her nationality; and if her sailng letters had been shown to the Chinese they would have known that she was not a British ship, and that the only register nuder w,hich she sailed had expired on the 27th of September. It was said, however, that the registry was stil in force, because the ordinance provided for cases in which registers expired wbile vessels were at sea. But how did the case stand ? Where was this ship on the 27th of September? Mr. Parkes, in a letter of the 12th of October, 1856, told them that on the 1st of September the Arrow sailed from Hongkong for Canton, and proceeded thence to Macao, where she lay a fortnight, painting and refitting; that sbe then loaded again outside Macao, re-entered that port, discharged a portion of her cargo there, and brought the remainder, consisting of rice, on to Canton, where she arrived on the 3d of October, five days after the register expired. According to that statement, then, the Arrow, when her register expired, was at Maeao, within three or four hoa' sail of Hongkong,-so that nothirg could have been more easy than for the master to proceed thither and to obtain a proper renewal of his license, which would have entitled him to trade at Canton. (ERear, hear.) It was clear that the Arrow was not at sea in any sense of the words. (Cheers.) Although close to the port of registry she did not choose to go there, but sailed on to Canton with an expired register, which, he asumed, was delivered to Ccns'i Parkes, who knew on receiving it-and must have told the captain-that it was mere waste Taper. (Cheers.) Whatever might be the anthority of the co onial ordinance it did not apply in this case; but they were gravely told that the register entitled the Arrow to British protection. Upon this point thore could be no mistake. (Lhear, hear.) Dr. Bowing tBust have understood the matter, and they could not accept the exouse made elsewhere that he did not understand hts owen ctse. l hisletter to Consul Parkes of the 11th of October Dr. aowritg said,-
It appears on examination that the Arow had no right to hoist the British flag; the license to do so expired on the 2e7th of September, from which period she has not been
ntitled to protection."| (Cheers.) Dr. Bowring admitted that, not only had the I register ex)u ed, hut that altar that pecried the Arrow was not entitled to p-otection. On the 12th of October Consl Parkes wrote a Iltter in which he faintly and falteringly suggested the possibility of getting out of the difficulty by saying that the Arrow might be supposed to have been at Pea when her license expired. II Mhen this document," said Consul Parkes, was depcsited with me on the 3dinst., the year for wlhichi it was granted had expired five days previously; but, if the statement of the master is to be believed, it was because the lorcha was then at sea, and has not been in the waters of the colony since the 1st of Sep,einber last, that timely application had not been made for i's renewal." Then followed a passage to which he (Mr. Palmer) had before referred, which showed that the Arrow bad been at Macao, a place much nearer to Hongkong than to Canton, and there was therefore no possible excuse for i.eglecting to renew the register. What was the decision of Sir J. Bowring under these circumstances? On the 13th of October he wrote to Consul Parkes, " I will consider the rezranting the regiser ofthe Arrow if applied for ; butthere can be no doubt that after the expiry of the license protecti. n could not be legally granted." (Cheers.) These were hearly the same expressions which Sir J. Bowring afterwards us d in writing to the Chinese Commissioner-" there could be r.o dQubt that the Arrow was entitled to protection," (Renewed cheers.) He would now advert to the argument of the Attorney-General with reference to the eharacter of a British shlip as defined by the navigation laws. He (Mr. Palmer) had shown that the Arrow did not become a Brtish vessel from the character of her colonial ownership, but she might possibly have become a British vessel by the authority of the Imperial Government. The AttorneyGeneral had quoted from the well-known work of Lord Ten. terden on Shipping, a passage describing the state of the law as it existed in formuer times. It must be remembered that at that period the navigation laws, which had now been abandoned with sueb general advantage to the country, prohibited the carrying of certain descriptions of goods, within definite liniits, in any but British bottoms, the right of carrying such goods being denied to foreign vessels. The ground taken by his hon. and learned friend the Attorney. General was, however, entirely cut away by the Merchant Shipping Act passed in May, 1855, previously to the grant of the license to the Arrow. It was perfectly clear under that Act that so far from the national authorities be-" allowed to sanction a claim to the protection of the British Slag on the part of any foreign vessel at Canton or elsewhere, they were absolately prohibited from doingso. It mas provded that the second portion of the Act, which de. fined British ships, their ownership, measurement, and registry, should apply to the whole of Her Majestys dominions. The Act, tlerefore, applied to Hongkong as well as to any other place which was not specialy except-d from its operation. With regard to ownership the Act provided that no ship should be deemed a Bdtish vessel unless she belonged wholly to a natural-born subject of the British Crown, with certaiu exceptions, to persons who had received letters of denizahton, or to persons naturalized by an act or ordinance of proper legislative authority. Now, it was not pretended that the owner of the Arrow answered any of these descriptions. The 19th section provided that every
BsitUs ship' imight be registerea in*prsibdmne except vessels not exceeding 30 tons, employed wholly in fishing or trading coastwise on the shores of Newfound-
land, Canada, Nova Scotia, &c. These vessels were of
much smaller burden than the Arrow, and were employed in a somewhat similar trade; but it would be observed that there was no exception with regard to Hongkong, and it was evident that but for the exception these small vessels must have come under the operation of the Act which provided that no ship thereby required to be registered should, unless registered, be recognized as a British ship. He contende , therefore, that the British authorities in China had violated the Act of Parliament by recogniziog the Arrow as a British Yessel. He found it provided by another section of the Act that, wbenever it was declared by, the Act that a ship beloniging to any person or body corporato qualified to be owners of Britibh ships should not he recognized as a British ship, such ahip should nut be entitled to any benefits,privileges, advantages, or protection usually enjoyed by Britis shipsaor touse theBritish flag. The British authorities at Canton had, then, been doing the very thing which this law prohibited-namely, encouraging a
vessel, which was not qualified to do so under the provisions of the Act, to carry the British lag and to assume the character of a British vessel, and, as if that flag and that character were legally assumed, they bad taken upon them. selves tc involve the whole empire of China in a war, the end of, hich no one could foretell. (Hear, hear.) With regard to the general question, he thought the aruments advanced by some hon. gentlemen-the stories of crimes
committed by the Chinese, of the vices of the Governmen' of the weakness of the people, and of the vexations to which British saubjects had been exposed-if they wero at all pertinent to the matter were erainly not in favour of the course taken by 4er Majesty'sGovern-

Mr. GLA.DSTONE.-I rise to answer the appeal made to me by the hon. and learned member for Hertford with regard to the appointment of Sir Jobn Bowring. That appeal, so far as I am concerned, was very naturally made because he was nmisled by the higherauthority of the speech of the right hon. gentleman the Secretary of State for the Home Department I complain of that speech in respect, not of sinicerity only, but of justice, in so far as the appointment of Sir J. Bowring is concerned; and I presumo to complain on behalf of the noble lord the member for the city of London; for to make him responsible for the ap pointment of Sir J. Bowring to high political and diplomatic position it was requisite to show more than the mere factthat hehadconsidered him fit from his commercial knowledge and his undoubted zeal and ability to discharge the sibordinate duties of the consulate. (Hear.) Bat I complain, also, on behalf of my right bon. friends near me and my. self, that a misapprehension has been created by the Secretary of State, who, if he did not know better, might have known better, and ought to have known better. (Hear.) The simple fact is that neither my right hon. friends near me nor myself were in any manner parties to the appoint. ment of Sir J. Bowring, and that we learned it, like the rest of the world, through the ordinary channels of information. (Hear, hear.) There is no doubt a sort of resposibility so far as we aro concerned, of which I am sure the candour of the hon, and learned member for Hertford will lead him to see the just extent. That appointment was made, I am far from saying blamneably, without the knowledgo or consent of tho Cabinet. It is not the usage or custom to require the consent of the Cabinet in such cases. It was mado known to the head of the Govermment, and it was by the head of the Government allowed to pass with a declaration that the consular services of Sir J. Bowring would have given him a knowledge of China which might be useful-that he (Lord Aberdeen) was not intimate with Dr. Bowringnorconversant with hiscareer-but that he know Lord Clarendontoboboth, and therefore heconsented. (Hear.) Now, Sir, as the name of Sir John Bowring must unfortunately recur from time to time through the whole courso of these discussions, let me state that, as far as I am concerned, I entirely disclaim and repudiate the description which has been given by the hon. and learned member of the issue we we are now trying. He says that it is a judieial issue, that the case we are now trying is the individual case of Sir J. Bowring, and that if a single doubt hangs upon that case it is our duty to acquit our re. presentative in China. I protest, Sir, against thus making Sir J. Bowring a stalking-horse to divert our atten. tion from the real matters that are in issue. (Cheers.) No doubt, the conduct of Sir J. Bowring is involved in these discussions, but we are not trying Sir'J Bowring judidaUy It is our duty to be fair, just, and esuitable towards him but our prime and paramount duty Ii to consider the in. tereAts of humanity and the honour of England (Cheers.) I regret that from motives which I do not doubt were nothing more than an excess of zeal for the public service Sir J. lowring has been led into proceedings in themselves unwarrantable; but I am bound to expss my candid conviction that the policy which Sir J. lswring has clumsily chosen his opportunity for carrying inoeffect vasa policy not unknown to Her Majesty's Government, nor by them disapproved. (Cheers.) I found myself in that statement upon matter palpable to us all. I found myself upon what was quoted by my right hon. Sriend the member for Carlisle-a letter from Lord Clarendon-from wkich it appeared to me to be distinctly established that that which had in former years been expressly prohibited by successive Secretaries of State has now come in principle to be permitted, and that it was understood between Sir J. Bowring and his official inferior that, although he was bound to use the best of his judgmcnt in making choice of his occasion, yet he was to regard himself at liberty to prosecute his design of obtaining entry into Canton, and that in case of need the force of tho British fleet 'was to be available for supporting him in thst design (lear, hear.) Therefore, Sir, it is not the case oE Sir J. Bowring that we are here trying, and far less is it the case of Sir Michael Seymour. (Cheers.) I am sorry to say that this is not a pleasant part of the question, and therefore I shalU not dwell upon It; but I must remind the House that there has been no answer to the statement made last night by my right hon, friend the member for South Wilts, who gave Tou a letter from Sir 3 Bowrlug to Sir Michael Seymour, n which undoubtedly the instructions of Ministers at home were commuincted to Sir Micha el Seymour but-althonuh I do not saythey were intentionally garbled, because ' have no right or disDosition to believe it-they were made known to Sir Michal Seymour in such a form and in a manner so incompleto that they mnst have misled his judgment and have communicated to him an erroneous impression as to the views and intentions of the British Government. (Hear, hear.) Sir, my right hon. friend the Secretary of State for the Rome Department said it was sad to see upon these occasions-and it is sad to see-tbat the memory of long and confidential official intercourse and of arduous labours conjointli' performed in the public service is not sufficient to restram men from acrimonious and personal attacks. I am
quite sure that the wvords wvhio I am now going to quote fell unintentionally from my right hon. friend, but at the same time, as those words have been spoken, they ought to be noticed. Imace no general charge of personalities against the Secretary of State for the Home Department. I do not hesitate to state my conviction that the words in question were used hurriedly and in the heat of debate, hut my right hen. friend did say when referring to the noble lord the member for the city oY London-
a II give him credit for that honesty of purposo and that depth of conviction which I know influence every action of his life. I 'wish that I could say as iiiuch-and I Would gladly if I could-for the right hon. gentleman the member for Carlisle."
Sir, I submit to the Government, if it be necessary for me to submit it, that these were words 'which could hardly have represented the true feelings of the Secretary of State, but if they did represent his true feelings they were words incompatible with the relations that ought to subsist be. tween ono member of this House and another. (Checrs.) But I Tpss, Sir, from these points to express the satisfacion witb which I heard, towards the close of the speech of
my right hon. friend, hismanly declaration that this was a question in which every man was bound to give his vote iTrcepective of party or political considerations. (Hear, hear.) My right hon. fziend spoke out those words with wannth aid sincerity, and I thin], it the duty of every one 'who folows him in debate to resmpnd to hi; appeal. Sir, Ibave hxa the means of knowing the mind of many members of this House with respect to the question bafore it, and I can tmuly say thatthere is notone of thom at lesat within my knowledge, who is about to support the motion of the hon. member for the WestRliding through the influenoe of ptrty or political motives. (Clheets ) was the more creditable, Sir, on the part of ay rigbt hon. friend to call upon us to apply this criterion, because,
not-preesming to Judge the secret notives of met, iint lookimg solely at their overt acts and plain declarations Ido not hesitato to say that the negative of tho resolution willot stAnd the application of thatte sovell. W6*hatD heard the remarks of the hon. members for West Xorfolk' and Cornwall (bear hear); and hero let me say tbat with regard to the cbarfes of anti-P otestntism and. D3
of starring. rmies, and of everything bate and vilo which it seems to be the pleasre of the hon. membor for Norfolk to hurl for4h, I am far too sensible of the vast importanoe of the issues that are before us to claim the right which perhaps tho indulgenoe of the House mht concedo of defending myself against those most dishonouring imputations. (Cheers.) Al these Ippus by in silence; but on tho rote,s of the hon. members for West Norfolk and Cornwall I must comment as a member of Parliament. The know what is doing in China. They know that no inconsiderable portion of Canton has boen in flames. They know that the troops which had been posted to defend the country against the rebcls have, throug stern necessity, been concentrated in that great capital. They knowr-for, without doabi, as Was their duty, they have read the papers-that,-
" The remoN al of a military presence, such as it was, from the districts overrun lst year by the Hak-ka men has exred these to a repetition of a calamity in more aggravated orm, anD a very consderable tract of onntry is believed to
behsewet clesesby thek k-oas O ed the rict ctyaems bee
West Norfolk and Cornwall, and ther think that they dischargo their duty as members of tbo ritish Hous of Commons when they frankly avow that the votes they are to give upon this great quettion of humanity and justice are to be influenced mot even by a desire to keop a Government in office-for that I could understandbut by a fear lest three insignificant gentlemen who sit on this bench should, through somo fancied combination, find theirway into power. (Loud cheers.) Sir, I have the consolation of reflecting that, though the votes which the hon members thus tender cAnnot indeed be rejztd by the Secretary of State for the HomeDeparmenttoj itisnoi
his power to refuse them-yet the high nature of my right hon. friend has preventodhimnfromixamiing himself, even in a critical moment, of those votes without laying down a principle that utterly condemns them. (Renewed cheering.) Now, Sir, there are some points that have been raised in these discussions which I pray the Houso to take note haVe been siubstantially abandoned or dispose of. it is yez well to talk of the opinions of British mnerchants; but it as never been tho practice of Parliament, when it has been dealing with qtestions in which a particular part of the community bad a particular and personal interest, even though that in. terest should be accompanied with the advantago of superior knowledgeo, to abdicate its own functions and to register its Judgments according to the opinions of thwat ulss.Ieertainly ,ike the Secretary of State for the Colonies, am one of the last men in this House who either ought to feel [or eould by posdbility feel a disposition to throw discredit
upon the cl as from which I am vprung; but I oblect entiely to this claim of authority, and say it isnotaccordin to the practice of Parliament. If it had been the practice ol
Parliament to govern its proceedings in cases where particular clases were greatl7 interested by the opinions of those classes, its deliberations would have taken a very different colour from that which they now wear. We certainly, when we were considering the Factory Bills, did not take as our parainout authority the opinions of the manufacturers. (Bear, hear.) When we were considering the Corn Laws we did not take as our paramount authority the opinion of the landed gentlemen. When wo were considering the abolition of the slave trade we did not take as our paramount authority the voices of the members for Liverpool (cheers)and if in 1833 tho sentiments of the West In,dia planters, with what they called their knowledge of the negro character, had been predominant, would emancipation have been given to the black population? Sir, the judgment of the merchants is an element in the case, but it does not dis. charge us of our responsibility to become ourselves the judges of that judgment, and to give seDtence accordingly. (Hear, hear.) There is another charge which is sometimes made against these unfortunate Chinese, and which seems to exist in the minds of some persons-that they have a practice, when there is a competition for official situations of preferring those who are supposed to be unfavourable to foreigners, and of dismissing others becauso they suspect them of an excess of friendly feeling towards foreigners. But China is not the only country in which I have heard of circumstances which appear to mo very correctly to answer tbat.description. I find it stated that Muhchangah, Wang, aud a number of other high Ministers had been dismissed because they were favourable to foreigners, while others whowere distinguished for their violence and dislike to foreigners had been promoted to posts of dignity and honour. Well, about two years ago a Prime Minister in this country, not very unlike this )Iuhcbangah, was dismisEed, because he was deemed too favourable to foreigners, and another mandarin, who undoubtedly has always reaped his principal credit with the people of England on account of his determined antipathy to the barbarian element, was appointed in his place. (Cheers and laughter.) Then, don't letus visit this so severely on the Chinese * tE -ause I really do not be. lievethatthere is much room for discnssion founded upon that cabalistio phrase "Insults in China." The Secretary of State for the Home Department cleared up a misapprehension on this subject, and showei us that the title of that book, which undoubtedly is delusive, had naturally its origin in the nature of things, aIthough the book does not consist of a string of insults inflicted upon the British by the Chinese. 17 years ago, when we frequently disocssed Chineso matters, there was frequently mentioned the name of Mr. Jardine, vwho was so well known in China that tho natives used to describe him under a sort of name the English interpretation of which certainly conveyed a compliment to his Scotch eagacity, being that of the "iron-headed old rat." (A laugh.) Now Mr. Jardine took the opportunity of a meetin of his countrymen connected with China to record, as an old resident in that country, his strong conviction that, although the Chinese were an unsocial-in fact, an anti-social, a pecuhar, and an exclusive people-yet that the general rule of their treatment of the English community was one of kindness and justice - and I believe that that is the impression which this bfne-book will leave upon the minds of those who have pernsed it. (Cheers.) How stands the case ? I believe that in the last seven years of the period to which this record refers you have but six cases of insult, either from Chinamen to British, or from Englishmen to Chinese; and I ask whether that is a state of things which, measuring it only by the number, would at all tend to support the proposition that you had festering wv ongs of old standing in China whick only waited the moment to break forth, and that though this lorcha business was not the cause of the war, yet that there were legitimate causes already in existence; or whether it does not show that yon have made by the good judgment of successive Ministers considerable progress in conciliating the Chinese, in establishing a footing in that country, and in reducing almost to nothing those petty quarrels which of course must occasionally occur ? (Hear, bear.) I won't go into the nature of those six cases which I admit to exist; but in two of them, if I remember rightly, the aggressors were Eng ishmen. In all the others the Chinese authorities exerted themselves to the full satisfaction of the British authorities in order to punish the offenders; and now let us look at the lastcase. (Hear,hear.) On the 6th of October-two days before the affair of the lorcha ihey brought to an end a case in which a British missionary as]it appers to mo in a most culpable manner, wilfully and deliberately violated the treaty and gave the Chinese authorities the right to demand that he should be pmnished. They demanded, however, no such thing. The native merchants became pecuniary security for him to a considerable amount, and M[r. Parkesj writing to Sir J. Bowring on the 0th of October, states that the Imperial Commissioner in managing the matter had shown a commendable mnoderation in not calling on him to take more stringent notice of that infraction of the treaty. (Cheers.) Then, the hon. n ember for the West Riding is comp,lained of for techni. calities, and yet not always for technicalities; sometimes for tbat, sometimes for generalities. If you show that there is uo ground for these proceedings you are accused of entangling yourself in technicalities; and if you speak of the general rules of amity and peace which sbould bind nations yon are accused of flying off into generalities; and so, alternating between technicalities and generalities, the defence of whatisindefensibleiscarriedon. (Cheers.) Letthe House remember how this case of the technicalities stands. If you fail in your proof of the technicalities you fail altogether; if you succeed in your proof of the techmealities you do not succeed in the main issue, but you only lay the first atop of a long process which you must demonstrate. If you are about to hang a man, and, alth&ugh you find a technical flr in the proceedings, yet persist in hanging him, is that a technical o*ence only, or is it not also an offence against the first principles of justice, tending to undermine the essential s:sfcguards of society? (Hear, hear.) It is just so here. You have got together with most elaborate skill a parcel of picas to impart a British character to that hich was Chinese, and if you fail in your argument you have not an inch of ground to stand upon. But if you succeed in your argument, what follows ? Not that you were justified in going to war, or m commencing hostilities without war; for
you must not only show that there has been some deniil of a right which you are entitled to claim, but you must show clearly upon evidence that the magnitude of the injury inflicted was sufficient to justify a recourse to arms -and unless you prove theso things and establish the substantial justice as well as the dry technicality of your demands, you might as wel never have be un your process of reasoning. That is the case of the techmcalities. But we are approaching the closo of the debate, and it is as well to register some of the results. Let me remind the House, therefore, that no notice has been taken of the argument of the learned civilian the member for Tavistock, who states, upon the authority of your own Qneen's Advocate, and of your own Foreigneoffioo, that, if there were a wrong here committed, the proper remedy was distinctly pointed out by the prnciple of the law of nations, and that it was to be sought in reprisals, and nothing beyond that. Let it be remembered that that challenge has not been anwered. (Cheers.) Mv hon, and learned friend the Attorney-General did indeeid answer a good many challenges. 1 takc it that this caso is arguable on three grounds-as a matter of municipal law, as a matter of international lA, or you may argue it, and far strongest of all, as a question of natural justice, What was the process of the Attorney.Oener.dI 1 never beard a gentlcman, learned or unlearned, do so much exec"ion in the course of a single sentence as wa-s dono bv my hoyL h ad
lhamned friend. In endeavouring to quote that sentence I am sur that labxll spoil it, so far as the beauty of the language goes, but Ishall give the substance of it, He sAid, "Don't expcet me to answer specificaly that wisich has been advanced in this House. What I Will do is to answer that which has been advanced elsewhete, and yOn 4t fina tbat in doing
that I shIal answer everything tbat has been said in this House . By that statement it appears
to mue that may learned friend did great execution;
for he contrived thereby-I wron't say to aifrent-but certails t to chasti se the vanity ot the whole House of '4ontn,oes and of oiie-half of tbeous of Lords. ("-Bear," ant
a laugh.) It is good for isato have our vanity chastis'est, and, as far as I am concerncd, I tender my thanks to im;
justice, of humanity, of the Christian religion, Isay that euch an appeal isa profanation when those sacred principles are invoktd in defence of flagitious falsehood, of base perfidy, cf cruel inhumanity, and atrocious crime, (Loud chesi .) I say, Fir, I heard, with great regret, appeals like t lose which have been made by hon. and right hon. gentle. men, i ecause I feel confident that the eloquence with which Provienoe has invested them was designed for nobler and I etter objects, whereas they have employed it to br(ak down a& the moral principles of truth, to jastify cnrme, and induco us to tolerate it. (Cheers.) What, th' n, iR the object of this motion? The hon. member who moved it appears to aim in a gieat degree at bis old and bstm friend, Sir John Bowring. Now,Ihave always understood that the way in vhich friends ought to deal v.ith each other is that indicated by the poet,-
" Be to their faults a little blind, " Be to their virtues very kind,
" And fix a padlock on tho mind."
(" Hear," and lauRhter.) Bat whether the hon. member for the West Riding has acted upon these principles with regard to his dear, his bosom, his ancient friend Sir John Bowring, I leave to the House to determine. (" Hear," an i a laugh.) At all events, I venture to say that there is no man whose heart will be more grieved at the enmity an I bitterne5s, undeserved and unexpected, of an old friend, than Sir Jobn Bowhnn will be when he reads these debates. (Cheers.) But, Sir, vwat is it, then, that we are wanted to
. Aye we to send out to China and say, "Tell Yth that he is right. (Cheers.) Tell him that subtle lawyers have discovered by a great variety of legal technicahties that the lorcha Arrow was really not a British ship according to the imperial law, that therefore he was right in what he did, and that he may do tho same again with any vessel under British colours which he may think, with what he calls reason, is liable to the same insult." (Cheers.) What would be the consequences of that ? Our trade at Honglon and Canton would be as insecure as if pirates had gained possession of the latter city as well as of other ports. There would be no security for any British property at Canton or upon the river. (Hear, hear.) But would that be all? Why, Yeh, raising a song of triumph, would say, " These cowardly Englishmen are afraid of mo. I have driven away all the barbarians that were here. They tell me that England is a great Power and has a great navy and army, but Englishmen are afraid of me. I, Commissioner Yeh, will do what I like vith them in future, and whether itpleases me to adorn the palisades v,ith Englishrather than with Chinese heads, I will do what I please; and their property shall be plundered by whoever chooses to do so." (Chees.) Would that state of things be confined to Canton? We have great and extensive interests at other ports as well as there. Shanghai, for example, is almost a European community. (Hear, hear.) What man will answer for the security of our people at Shanghai one fortnight after the news of the adoption of such a motion as this? (Hear, hear.) It would be a virtual casting-off of your British communities ; it would be committing them to the mercy of these barbarians; it would be a public manifestation to the whole world that you are not prepared to defend by your power those whom you you had induced to place themselves and their property in a foreign land. (Loud cheers.) Such a Proceeding would, I say, be disgraceful to the country as well as dangerous to those whom we are bound to defeDd. (Cheers.) The right hon. gentleman at the cononsion of his speech described in very e!oquent terms the opinion whicb, in his view, foreign nations take of the possible decision of this House. Sir, I am afraid that their view will be far different from that of the right hon. gentleman. (Hear, hear.) They wril say, " Here is a Power that has been formerly great in arms, whose armies have gained victories in remote regions, whose fleets have floated triumphantly over every ocean; the people of this country are governed by a deliberate assembly-powerful, as the right hon. gentleman says, and responsible for its acts. At last a change has come over the spirit of their dream. This mighty, and hitherto undaunted nation, vho have deemed it their duty to protect their fellow-subjects wherever they were authorized by their laws to go-this proud and hitherto mighty people have now laid aside their hold front and have shrunk from encountering Commissioner Yeh. (Cheers and laughter.) They who have braved the armies of Russia; they who maintained a long and not unsuccessful conflict with one of the greatest nations in the world,"-with whom, I trust, we are destined never again to come int conflict except, as our Freneh neighbours say, in a conflict of generusty (hear, hear),-" this people are now overcome by the love of gain. (Cheers.) They fear the expenses and the efforts which may be necessary to protect their countrymen, and they abandon a large community of British subjects at the extreme end of the globe to a set of barbarians-a set of kidnapping, mur. denng, poisoning barbarians." (Cheers.) I say foreign nations would feel that England has descended from that high station which hitherto she has occupied, at the beck of some of the basest, the meanest, and the most degraded beings in the civilized world. (Cheers.) They would say, "What has brought about this change ?" Those who look below the surface, those who look not merely to results, but investigate causes, would say, "Do not believe that the British nation is aparty to these proceedings. (Loud cheers). 1No," they woela say," tace care of yourselves; do not imawine that so bold, so brave, so generous a people are consenting parties to this cowardly arrargemnent, or that you may safely trust to meet withsimilarconduct for the future. (Hear, hear.) Itis an oco.sional event. (" Hear" and laughter.) It depends upon an accidental condition of things iu the great courcil of the British nation. There have been combinations recently entered into (loud cheers) among men who had for a long course of time been kept apart by the strongest difference of opinion, and by recollections of resentment even not now entirely forgotten." They would say, " This combination, not daring to put forward their acts in the face of day-having concluded a secret treaty (" cheers," and laughter), not guaranteeing their present state of possession (that being the last thing they wish to do), but guaranteeing to each other the state of possession which they hope to obtain-have cautiously abstained in the reFolutions they have proposed from using words which would fully in the face of day have explained and clearly develored unto all the nations the object which they have in view. (Cheers.) They have shrunk from moving an address to the Queen to remove Ministers whose places they want to occupy. (Cheers and laughter.) They knew that that Government, not so much perhaps for its own maerits as for the demerits of those who might be its rivals slaughter), did possess the approval of the country, and that, if the question were fairly put, 'Aye or No, wil you have that Government or the Coalition Government which we are prepared to offer you?' they knew perfectly well what the answer of the country would be. (Loud cheers.) Knowing tbat, and tberefore sheltering themselves under the mysterious veil of unintelligible phrases, and imposing upon the conscientius feelings of honourable and respectable men who, in supporting the resolution, do not stop to inquire whether the wvar in just or necessary, or what the wrongs are which have produced it, but are prepared upon every occasion to assert that no recourse to force is ever leitimate or allowable"-foreiga nations will say that this coalition, practising upon the good feelings of these persons, and uniting themselves with those from whomi they have been hitherto long and widely separated have-if the result should beso-succeededin(Iwilluse no uncivil term) e±tracting from the House a vote the effect of which is different from that which it would have been had they manfully and boldly stated their object. (Cheers.) Foreign nations will say, " Don't trust the English Governiment. Look at the result of this debate and division. There are some members of the Legislature who raise the nicest legal quibbles, who endeavour to excuse the most attrocious crimes (cheers), who take part with any foreigner against an Englishman, and who-like the hon. member for the West Riding-almo4t repudiate their country, This result may have arisen from a combination of acci. dental circumstances, but beware how you imagine that you can venture to deal with the British Government upon the assumption that they represent the feelings and intententions of the nation." I don't intend to follow the exanple of the right hon. baronet the member for Carlisle Sm . Graham), who went so far as to say that every member of this House would be accountable for the vote e may give not only to his own conscience, not only to his constituents, not only to his couutrymen, but-if I did not misunderstand him-at that last day when all human actions will be scanned. 1 don't go so far as that (oheers and laughter), but I do say that this House has now in its keeping not only the interests, the property, and the lives of many of our fellow. country men (cheers), but that it has also in its keeping the honour (cheers), the welfare, the reputation (renewed cheers,)-expressions which my noble friend the memberfor theoityyof London justlypreferred to the foreign term "prestige"- of this great empire. (Cheers.) That is a sacred and a holy trust, and hon. gentlemen should conscientiously consider iU what manner they propose to discharge it. They may think they re only expressing their disapprobation of the destruction of certain fortresses or of particular public buildngs n Crnon,-hey my th nktey are only recording an opinion that less severe measures would have been sufficient to meet the case,-that the additional demand made was one that might have been foregone,--,r that if they had been in the situation of Sir J. Bowring they would have acted somewhat differently. These are highly honourable considerations, and it is quite proper that they should have their due weight, but there are greater interests at stake in the vote to be given to-night. (Cheers.) This House has now to determine a question of vast importance to British interests that now exist, and that my hereafter accrue. Not merely the pro. perty, but I will venture to say the lives of many of your-contryme depend upon your vote. Thosewho are
most averse to the law s which indlict upon tbe greatest male' factors the penalty of death may weU pause before thoy
come to a decision by which they may, it is to be feared, ipass sentence of death upon many of their fellow-subjects
abroad . (HEear.) I kave trespassed longer than I had in-
tended to do upon the attention of the House, but I do trust that hon. gentlemen will not allow themselves to be carried away by the eloquent flourishes which we have heard in the course of the debate. I trust they will view this subjeet in
its true light, as bearing upon the real interests of the country; and I am satisfied that impartial men, who are not wedded to party, who are not members of any coalition that has been formed (cheers)-and there are, and I h-spe siways wll be, in this House many men vwho act most independently and who' exercise their OwnD judgment upon the questions brought before them-will give their votes in such aL manner as to maintain the honour, the dignity, and the interests of the country. (Loud and continued cheering.)
Mr. GLADSTON.--I rise just to say one word in explanation. I understand that during my temporary absence from the House the noble lord at the head of the Governxment stated that I had defended the acts of retaliation which have taken place in China. Now, in answer to that *statement, I need onZ refer to some of the ex-
,resisons which I used. I remember twvo of them. I4seci ibed those acts of ret-aliation as detestable acts, and I
jpol,~f them as an abominable system of warfare, (Hear,
ord PALMERSTON.-WThat I said was that the right ;opJ gentleman had done his best to characterize what had taken place asa wanthn attack by the strong upon the weak. ('Hear hear.}
' . DISRAELL-I wisb, Sir, very briefly to recall
tbo ab,leution of the Honse to the real issue which we are about to decide. (Hear, hear.) The noble lord
has entered into the subject with a grt deal of dtail (cries of " Divide," and cheers from the Opposition), which I should have hoped after the discussion which has taken place had become obsolete. ("Divide!" and "Heir.") The noble lord has cast imputations upon the right hon. gentleman the member for the University of Oxford, and has intruded into the debate observations which must have originated from a speech made many years ago. The noble lord has also found fault with the resolution upon which we are now about to decide, and has character. ized it as being indefinite, aud he has attributed to me the expression of an opinion that it is a vote of censure upon the Government. Now, I beg to inform the noble lord that to Ime the resolution appears both definite and moderate, and the implication that it is a vote of censure on the Government did not originate with me, but with the learned Lord-Advocate. (Hear, hear.) In fact, on the motion for the adjournment of the debate I stated that as the Government considered the motion to be a vote of censure I should not be wilting to press it prematurely to a division. I am, however, unwilling to quarrel with the name the noble lord has accepted, and I also accept this as vote of censure upon the Governnment. (Hear.) I think it more for the honour of the House of Commons that it sheuld be so considered than that it should be regarded as a mere censure upon absent officials. (Hear.)I can assure the House that I am not gming to enter into any of the legal arguments which have been adduced, and I must admit my surprise that the debate has been so lengthened by the introduction of the legal element into the argument, because it appears to me that the observations dispose of the whole of that part of the subject. (Hear, hear.) In the first place, if the Arrow had been a British ship, built at Blackwall, owned by an Englishmau, and manned by British seamen, I do not think that the Government would havebeen authorized to take the course which they bave adopted (hear, hear) and in the second place the representatives of England in China were unable to take their stand upon the case which they originally stated, and were driven to placing the whole matter on a very different issue, and therefore I think that the legal part of the question as regards the error is not very material. The question has all along been one not of law, but of policy, and it is to the question of policy that I shall briefly address myself, for that aS the quertion upon which we are called upon to decide, and I hope that the House will not be diverted from the real issue which is involved by the tone wlich the noble lord so singularly4dopted towards the close of his speech. (Hear.) The noble lord made use of a regular tu quo q argument. (Hear.) Some gentlemen have found fault with what they have described as a disregard for truth on the part of Sir J. Bowring ; to that the noble lord replies that Yeh is a liar. (" Hear, hear," and a laugh.) Some gentlemen have spoken with more freedom than perhaps I should have allowed myself to use of the conduct of British merchants abroad ; to that the noble lord replies that we who are going to vote for this resolution are influenced by a lust for gold. ("No, no," and " Hear.") Let us come to this question of policy. It appears to me that Sir J. Bowring has been unjustly treated by the majority, indeed I may say by all the speakers who have addressed the House, because his conduct has been ratified, sanctioned, and approved by the Government. an( is, la n.y opinion, not to be too strictly reviewed _ -e House of Commons. But t he case is much s-ronger than that; I have only knownDr. Bowring as a public man, baving sat with him in this House, as many of us have done; but I remember that three or four years ago he returned from bis consulate, having revisited England in order to receive bis instructions before he appeared in his new and superior station at Hongkong. Sir J. Bowring then called on several of the leading members of beth Houses of Parliament, and, among others, he did me the honour to call on me, though I had no social acquaintance -with him. He talked very franl;ly of his ideas with respect to the position of China and the policy to be pursued there, and I am bound to say that the poliy then recommended by Sir J. Bowring was the policy which he has recently put in practice, and which is before us in the papers on the table. I have a right to assume that he spoke as frankly to Her Majesty's Ministers as he did to those members of Parliament on whom he called, and I have furtber a right to assume that they entirely shared his views and approved his policy after he entered upon the government of Hongkong, (Hear, hear.) Now, if this be the case, I think that under aul the circumstances the conduct of Sir J. Bowring is notopen toseverecriticism, but that it is thepolicyof the Government we are called on to discuss. (Hear, hear.) It would in such circumstances be most ungenerous on our part and most unjust to make this an issug on the personal character and conduct of an absent man. (Hear, hear.) Let us, however, look at this policy. It is an attempt by force to increase our commercial relations with the East. (Hear, hear.) I agree with my hon. friend the member for Liverpool and my hon. friend the member for Hastings that it is most desirable to have our commercial relations with China increased; and I should look forward with great interest to the new treaty for that object to wbich the noble lord has referred; but I cannot rEconcile such a policy with the course that has recently been pursused by the Government. (Hear, hear.) There is one idea too prevalent with regard to China,-viz.,
that all England has to do is to act with energy in order to produco the same results as in India. (Hear.) Fifty years ago Lord Hastings offered to conquer China if he were only allowed o0,000 men. So great a captain as the Marquis of Hastings might have conquered that empire, but since the time when our Clives and Hastings founded our great Indian empire the position of affairs in the East has greatly changed. Great Powers have been brought into contact with us in the East. We have the Russian Empire and the American Republic there. and a political compromise developing itself like the balance of power in Europe; and, if you are not cautious and careful in your conduct now in dealing 'with Cbina, you will fina that you are likely not to establish commerce, but to excite the jealousy of powerful States, and to involve yourselves in hostiaties with nations not inferior to yourselves. (Hear, hear.) Look at the peosi tion in which you have placed yourselves within these. two months With the two countries of Persia and China (Hear, hear.) I hope we may have peace with Persia, and that in a few days that peace will be announced, having probably accepted the very terms we some months aqo refused. (Hear, hear.) But if you have peace with Persla you wiUl probably have succeeded in establishing Russtan ascendancy in that country by your vieoent conduct (hear, hear), while in, China where also you may soon have peace, you will have established the ascendancy of the United States. (Hear, hear.) If that is the true state of affairs, this country must dismiss from its mind the idea of dealing as it has done with barbarous States with which Powers civilizedlike ourselves have great sympathies, and wemust habituate ourselves to the idea of extendingto countrieslikeChina thesame piplomatic intercourse that we have with other nations. (Hear.) You cannot do that in a moment; but I maintain that we have made great advances in our relations with China already, and that the policy which the Government has adopted is one which will deprive my hon. friends the members for Liverpool and Hastings. of those very results which they desire to obtain. (Hear, hear.) You are dealing with a country of immense antiquity. You have been reminded in this debate that China enjoys a civilization of 2i centuries. Why, Sir, the civilization of Europe is nothing to that. But the result of those ancient habits and customs is the existence of great cereruony and etiquette. and you expect that a country of that kind should not be outraged by the frank and sormetimes the brutal freedom of European manners. With the policy which has been indicated by the noble lord-the policy of combination with other powerful European States in attempting to influence the conduct of the Chinese by negotiations and treaties-it ii my firm hope and belief that ultimately, slowly but surely, we may attain our end; but it is because the actual policy of the Government-the policy approved and vidicated by the noble lord-seems to me inconsistent with the policy of combination wiith other European States, that I think the time has arrived for the House of Commons to express an opinion upon events so startlng and upon behaviour so inconsiderate. How has the Honse been caUed upon to express its opinion? We have been told to-night of factious combinations and concerted movements. Lot us see whether the facts justify such broad accusations on the part of the noble lord. Why, Sir, one thing is quite clear. Here is a motion of 'which notice was given by a gentle. man who acts certainly in no poltical connexion with hon. members on this side of the House, and with not many on the other side. (A laugh ) It is evident that the motion conld not have boen seen before it was placed in your hands, Sir, by any great number of members, because-the objection was, I admit, almost a technical oneit was drawn up in such a manner, with what we call the annexo of a proposed committee, that many hon. gentlemen on this side of the House at once declared that they could not support it in that form. (Hear, hear.) We have been told, Sir, of party moves. I really think the time has come when hoth sides of the House should cease indulging in these platitudes. (Cheers and laughter.) Why, Sir, everything is a party mnove in a House which ought to be ruled by party, and ahich, if knot ruled by party, would soon lose all its significance. What is a party but a body of men who who have a policy which they recommend, and who do not shrink from the responsibility of putting that poliucy into practice? But I maintain that there has been no party move on the present occasion. -A resolution has been
brought forwara by the hon. m-ember frteWs i
On this side of the House it has received considerable, but not unanimous support. I have the nmisfortune to differ on thisoccasionfromrmanygentlemenwith whom lact inpolitical * life, and among whom are some of mymost intimate friends. in private life. If I look to the benches opposite I find there the noble lord the member for the city. (Cheers.) He is
also a part to this unprincipled combination. I really think that the First Minister should settle his courteous description with his late much-cheribhed and honoured colleague, and not with me. (A laugh.) There are also gentlemen opposite who once did act in very intimate connexion with the Conservative party, and the apprehension that that intimacy should be reneweed has conjured up before the First Minister a combination at once the most horrible' and the most heterogeneous. (Cheers and laughter.) The First Minister is oEf all men the man who cannot bear a coalition. (Laughter.) Why, Sir, he is the archetype of political combinations without avowed principles: (Greatcheering and laughter.) See how his Government is formed. It was only last year that every member of his Cabinet in this House supported a BiU introduced, I think, by a late colleague. It ('was opposed in the other- House by a member of the Government, 'who, to excuse his apparent inconsistency, boldly declared that 'when he took ofice the First Minister required no pledgo from him on any subject whatever. (Laug ter.) Yet the noble lord is alarmea and shoeked at this unprincipled combination! The noble lord cannot boar coalitions! The noble lord has acted only with those among whom he was born and bred in politic'. (Cheers and laughlter.) That infant Hercules (exclimed the
mghthon getlean,pointing to Lord Palmerston)'a

te last hall century, duricik 'which he has professed
voked, were not retrained within the limits imposed by civilization and Christianity-ought to Xare xendered the British authorities mnore cautious Ina dealing with such a people. They ought to hive set an example or justice, humanity, and moderation in dealing with the Chinese. Although they should have maintained anu altitude of firmnes, they should have been firm only when they knew they were right ; and instead of insisting upon 'hat as a violation of a treaty which tbey knew not to he so-instead of inaisting, after they had received reasonable reparation for an alleged though douibtful injury, upon new and further dewand.&-their first object in dealing with such a people shiould have been to show howr superior the light of civilization and the knowledge of Christianity had rendered the Britisha people to the inhabitants of China. Our trade and commerce were no doubt instruments of good to them as well as to ourselves-instruments of good to them if we endea6voured to extend them in a spirit of prudence, of wisdom, and of goodwill. The expansion of our trade and comnmerce would be of signal advantage to nmsnkind ; and the pceful extension of our means of in-
tscourse with the bines would be to that people and to us in the highest degree beneficial; but if we sought to force it from themn-if we endeavouired to excite therm, to exasperate their sense of dignity-to inivolve them in a struggle of this cruel kind, and to expose them to these dreadful calamities, under'circrnmstances which no maan could lay his hand on his heart and justify, then that appeared to him to be the last course calcuilated either to increase our commerce or our infitience, or to conciliate the fusiendship or goodwill of the people of China. (Cheers.)
Colonel HERBERT had listened with the deepest attention to the speeclh of the Home Secretary on the previous evening, and was at first inclined to draw from that speech t'he most cheering prospects as to the support that public officers emiployed at a distance mnight expect at the hanids of Her Majesty's Government; but when he remembered the case of the late Lord Raglan, andl the very small support that was measured ouxt to hiim when he was at the head of the British army, under circumsntances of unparalleled difficulty; whent he remnembered that the Government, conscious of those difficulties, failed to extend to him a fair share of support, while they Fshrank froma the responsibility of calling himn home, he felt that there was not miuch confidence to be placed in the fine sentiments of the right hon. gentleman. (Hear.) When the right hon. gentleman spke of Supporting public servants at a distance he couldonot help thlinking that a little of the virtuous indignation to which he gave expression might have helped to cheer and solace the last hours of that nioble-hearted man in the crimea, and he could niot but feel indignant that the Government should have reserved all their sympathies for a -worthless case like the present, and that all the legal ingenuitv anid subtlety of the Attorney-General should have bees~ employed to mystify the House regarding it. (Hear.) That mystification hadl been cleared away by hen, members who followed him; and he would only add that the eawe they were discussing was that of an irdividual who had been described by the noble lord the memaber for the city of London-and he appealed to every memiber whiether, with the papers before him, he didl not think he was justified in that description- as a troublesome and worthless official. (Hear, hear.)
M1r. KENDALL could not support the resolution of the hon. memiber for the West Riding, and must say that he was grieved and alarmed to find that so mnany gentlemen on that (the Opposition) aide of the House were prepared to condemn on such grounds an absent public servant. He had thought carefully on the subject., and the conclusion he arrived at was that it was most unjust, ungenerous, and even dangerous too hastily to condemn a public servant. (Hear, hear.) Ile did not so much refer to an individual as to public men in generaL Let a public servant bave as rauch moral courage as he could have, and let himn have ever so much confidence in himself, if he found the House of Commons prone to condemn him he would be more than mortal if his usefulness was not to a certain extent affectedI by it. (Hear, hear.) Hle did net meau to say that he approved altogether of what Sir John Biowring hadl done, but ho asked whiether, taking common sense as their guide, it would he fair or just to condlemn him. (Hear, he-ar.) They had heard much of humanity, and he gave those gentlemen who emplyed that aiument faul credit for their sincerity ; but he claimed equal credit for himiself, and his conscientious belief was that it this resolution Passed it would be the cause of much bloodshed. (Bear.) If the Chinese were very strong they would put forth their strength, and no Englishman's life in that part of the world would be worth a day's purchas9e; if they were not strong, but thought that they were sympathized with in this country, then we would be coaxing them on to destruction. They would be induced to bg o ut large forces which would be cut to pieces in hundreds3 by oar broadsides. Instead of such a course as that a musket-shot dropped now and then was a merciful thing. (" Oh, oh!1") It was a merciful thing to kill a few to save thousands. (Elear, haear.) He was certainly astonished to hear British merchants run dlown as if they were the sconm of the earth (hear, hear)to hear the Chinese talkedl of as if they were gentlemen ard we the revers, as if they were the Christians and we the barbarians. (Hear, hear.) Hadany change taken place -within the last few months? If three monthLs ago he had given to the Chinese the char4cter which was now given to them people would have maid that man is a fool (laughiter) -he ought to be sent to alunatic asylum. (Elear.l On thes grounds he would be very cautions indeed in giving his support to the resolution. But he had other groundrs for naot soupporting it. The right hon. gentleman the memiber for Carlple '-aid they might be justified in suspecting absent persons. If that was so le was surely justified insuspecting
theose that were present, andl he must say, therefore, thaLt
he thought this lorcha question was urged wvith a view to ultero coseuncs (Hear, hear.) A man must be blind indeed 'who dI'd not see that there were certain comnbinstios s at work. (Hear, hear.) There mnight not have been communications between individuals, but there was not rmuch necessity for that.' If, however, this combination should succeed, what would be the consequence ? (Hear.) He wouldl not say one word that was unparliamentary. He kuew very well that he could not make a speech-he always spoke right, as in the best way he could, but he hoped he would say nothing out of p lace. If the pTresent Ministry went out he presumed that recourse woali be hadl to certain gentlemen on the other side of the House- -say to the noble ior tdhe member for London, the right hon. gentleman the member for Carfisle, the right hon. gentleman the member for the University of Oxford, and the right hen,. gentleman the mnember for South Wiltshire. These gentlemen would probably form part of the new Ministry. Now, he couldnot forget whodrifted us into the late war. (Hear, hear.) He could not forget who they were that so badly managed it, and brought upon us all our disasters. (Rear, hear.) Nor could he forget who brought us out of our difficulties. (Hear, hear.) Hle believed that nine-tenths of the English people attributed oar disasters to the gentlemen oppo'Site, and that they had not forgottenx that to the noble lord at the head of the Government was due the honoutr of having. brought us out of the war. (Rear, hear.) We were now at war with Chiina. Who was the most likely man in th at House to get us out of our difficulties? (Hear, hear.) He wished now to say aword to his own side of the House He admired the abilities of the hon, member for the West Riding, but did net like his politics, and was astonished at the chLeers with which his speech was received by the Opposition. (Hear, 'hear.) Whenl the hen, member uttered his prophecies with respect to France and Russia who attempted to sneer him dossnl The Opposition-and yet the Conservatives were the very parcties who cheered his speech upon China. There was another point whichbhedesrire d to notice. The right hon. baronet the member f .r Carlisle had had the boldness-for he was abhold m%
(a laugh)-to speak of our conduct at Odessa as an example to our Authorities at Canton. He had a right to sly so ; but what right had the Opposition to cheer him, or, if they were entitled to cheer hima now, what right ha tef to blame him with respect to Odeaa? (Hlear, hear.) It was not that t e noble lordl the member for King's Lynn (Lord pStanl(ey) should cheer the speeches on the other sids, for he was fast coming round to the hon, member for thu West Riding; but wh'y the Conservative party should joiAtin the cheering itwasgimpossible to imagine. ("Hear, hear," and a laugh.) The right hon. baronet the mrember fur Carlisle had somnewhat misrepresented his hon. friend the mnember for West Norfolk (Arx. Bentinck). His hon. friend did not say th at the noble lordI at the head of the Governmnent was an anti-Catholic and anti-democratic Minister, but. that he would naever by any vote of his be accessory to bringing into power, especially in combination with a Conservative Government, any of these right hon, gentlement who for the last two years had been identified with all the anti-Psotes. taut and democratic measures which had been breught
before Parliament. (Hear, hear.) For his own part, he didI not agree with his hon. friend upon all points. He was not a, Dissenter or a Low Churchman; he mnight not be a ma6n
of good judgment, and certainly be was an erring mortal (aI laughi); butthis he knew,that therew'as astrong and growing party in the country-he meant the extreme High Church party, whose doctrines and proceedings wrere calculated to
lestroy the Church. ("1Hear, hear," anid laughter.) He -was grateful-the whole country was grateful-to the noble lord a,title head of the Government for his episcopal appointn ents. (Cries of "Question !") He we.s speaking to the question, for he was afraid that if the resolution of the hen, member for the WVest Riding were carried a party would get into power wrho would not evince the same Protestant feeling as the noble lord. (Cheers and laughter.) Strong Conservative as he was, he would rather sacrifice his
pDolitiCalprnilstaaiinbignabusuhac-
Mr. M. GIBSiON would not presume to go into the Church controversies which had been introduced, he knew not wvy, by the last speaker. (Cheers.) He rose on Thursday last to second the motion of the hon. member for the West Riding, of which he did not then think it necessary to make any observations, after the very able and comprehensive speech of his hon. friend. He felt, however, that he should not bo discharging his duty if he did not ask the House to hear a few remarks before the debate closed. The hon. member who spoke last, like many other gentlemen Rho had addressed the louse, seemed not quite to comprehend the position in which they were placed. Why was it necessary that Parliament should pronounce an opinion upon the proceedings in China ? In the speech from tho Throne Her Majesty annonnced that hostilities had commenced with Chine, and the Government laid on the tables of both Honses papers conveying fun] information as to the grounds ef these hostilities The object undoubtedly was to invite theopinion of Parliament, for there must be an answer when papers were laid on the table by command of Heet Majesty. If those papers had been received in silence, the acquiescence of Parliament would have been immediately assumed. (Hear, hear.) Therefore when it Wa said that it would be wrong to exprems any opinion by vote upon the question of the war with China while heIx
tilities were going on, it was at least equally wrong for the Goveiment to lay the information blrore the House, wlhich was untamount to ayingi "'iou, t%b House o
the most munificent testimonial ever presented to a mem.ber of Parliament, he did not shrink from branding them with Eelfishness, or from accusing them of wishing to get 'up a war in order to raise the price of their own com. mcdities. The hon. member for Liverpol (Mr. HorsfaU), who spke with great ractical knowledge of the quesion, gave the best reasons for the course adoptod by the Government, while the member for Hastings (hlr. Robertson), in a speech which did him honour, because it showed that the force of bis convictions compelled him to separate himself from his usual poltical fnends, declared, from his own experience as a resident for many years at Canton that the charges prefen ed by the two hon. members of dte Manchester school are not founded on fact. Any hon. gentleman free fro,n those party motives which it is unparliamentary to ascribe to anybody, but which we nevertheless all have (laughter), could not hesitate, after hearing the practical witnesses who bave come forward on this occasion, to pronounce a judmnent in favour of the noble lord. That would be the Cecision of any impartial man who sat on a jury in this case; and certainly, with so many legal gentlemen addressing us, this is more like a trial before a jury than a Parliamentary debate. There is one argument which will weigh at least with the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Supposng you pass Ihis vote of censure, and recall Sir J. Bowring in disgrace, I understand you will have a Bill brought into this House for damages on behalf of British, American, and other mertbants, to the amount of 5 Q°°0°°01. sterling. This may seem a mere trifle to these wiio are bent on what they call * justice to China," but it will be no trifle to tho people of England if they bave to pay it. But this will not be the only evil consequence. lt may suit the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Gibson) to throw ridicule on this point, but I say that if you disavow Sir J. Bowring neither the Property nor the lives of Euroes at Canton will be safe. The name of Dr. Lushington has been alluded to in this debate. This reminds me that the bon. and learned member for Stamford
Sir F. Thesiger) last night referred to the bombardment of Coenhagen, at which he appears to have been Present as a midshipman. I much regret that the hon. andlearned gentleman ever left the navy. (A laugh.) If he had remained in that service I feel sure that he would have achieved as great distinction in it as he has won in the legal profession. Bat, then, I am convinced that if he had been in Admiral Seymour's place he would have acted preisey as that gallant officer has done. Will the House allow me to quote the sentiments expressed in this House in 1808, in the debate on the bombardment of Copenbagen by a Mr. Lushirgton, whose language would have done honour to the present bearer of that eminent name ? I would draw the particular attention of the representatives of the Manchester school to this passage. Mr. Lushington said:-
" The sentimental system of hon. gentlemen would embrace all nations but their own. These ingenious disquisitions may be wellcalculated for the amusementof the schools, but they are not fitted for the events of real life, or a state of ferocious war." (" Oh, oh !") Can anything vorse be conceived than the present stato of things in China (Opposition cheers), wben rewards are offered for the heads of our countrymen ? Is the bon. gentleman who intenupts me so thoroughly Tartarized in histastes that he wshes for sometbing more? (Laughter.) Mr. Lushington continued :--" Sir, the first law of nature, the foundation of the law of nations, is the preservation of man. It is on the knowledge of bis nature that the science of his duty must be founded. When the feelings point out to him a mighty danger, ar d his reason suggests the means of avoiding it, he must despise the sophistical trifler who tells him it is a moral duty he owes to others to wait til the danger break upon his foolish head lest he should hurt the meditated instrument of his destruction."
(Hear, hear.) This debate seems to me to have been a medley of questions of law and abuse of Sir J. Bowring. I think " the plaintiff's attorney" was never so well abused as on the present occasion. What are the antecedents of Sir J. Bo-ring? ('Hear, hear," and a laugh.) He was first introduced to me when I entered Parliament by the righthon.member for Manchester. Atthattimetheright hon. gentleman sat on the Conservative side (laughter); and no man is better able to give an opinion on the different states of feeling on both sides of this House than the right hon. gentleman, who has vacillated so often. Well, the right hon. gentleman introduced Dr. Bowring to me as a man of great abilities, although not a lively speaker (a laugh) ; but, said he, "He has only one crotcbet, and that is about peace." (Laughter.) I believe be was then the Secretary of the Peace Society - and I must say I think it unfortunate that this circumstance was not taken into consideration by the noble lord who gave Sir J. Bowring his appointment. But in the course of this debate ho has been htnted down he has been called a liar, a plunderer-in fact, everything but a thief (" Hear," and a laugh); he has been accused of every larceny but petty larceny. I have no doubt, notwithstanding the usual unwillingness of hon. gentlemen on the benches below to throw out imnputations (a laugh), that he wiUl be accused of that before the night is out. But what has been done in China? I believe, owing to his peculiar fidgetiness of disposition, of which there is no doubt, he is net afavourite with the merchantsat Canton. They do not like him, and one reason for thatis, thatsoon after his arrival he undertook to settle a question which had been pending for six years about certain duties, and having taken the Chinese side of the question he made the British merchants pay up. The merchants, however, petitioned that he should, have fuller powers, and he was made Superin. tendant of Trade by Lord Aberdeen's Government. In con. cluding the treaty with Siam he showed the greatest ability. But, after all, is it Sir John Bowring's character which is at stake? (EIear, hear.) No man can be deceived on that point. Itisnot the superintendeut at Hongkong who is struck at, bat the Minister in Downing-street. (Cheers and counter cheers.) You care little about Sir John Bowring
it answers your purposeto blacken his character-an amiable amusement forsooth-but your real object is to displace the noble lord. (Cheer) You objeot altogether to the foreign policy of the noble lord. (Cheers. ) Whio that has listened to this debate can have failed to ciall to mind the great debate of 1810 ? (Hear) Changing Greece for China, and substituting Bowring for Pacifico, we maight imagine that we were listening to the same speeches and going through the same debate. But of what faults do you accuse the noble lord ? He remained at his post in times of difficulty when the war waxed hot, and success was doubtful. He was deserted by a body of gentlemen, for whom individually I entertain the greatest personal respect, but whose public eourse, I think, has been neither prudent nor patriotic-but he weathered the storm, he brought the 'vessel of the State into smooth water, and now you seek to throw hima overboard (hear)-tbe man who never forgot a friend, and who has no enemies but those of his country and his counitr'is lhonour. (Laud cheers.) Is this a proper courseIs hs the gratitude wbieh the country owes to the noble lord? I differ from the noble lord on many points-I differ from the course which he took the other evening. I did not vote on that occasion because I had not given the noble lord warning; but however I may differ from him I wiil not stab hibu in the back. (II Hear, hear," and laughter ) But, supposing you do upset the noble lord, in what lorcha are you going to embark? I think that hon. gentlemen opposite must acknowledge that the crew is rather mixed. (Lgughter.) They have taken for their compradore the
hon. menmber for the West Riding, in whom they have I always had such strict confidence, the master is in anotber place, and the registered owners, I grieve to say, arc the well-known firm of Russell and Co. (Laud laughter.) I hiave nothing to say with respect to the great name which heads this firm. I honourthatr noble lord, and not awordshall fall from my lips to cause him pain or 3yefrge u
am afraid that the noble 10 r giving way to a chivalrous feelinlg for the Chinese niation, has allowed himself on this occasion to be made the catspaw of others. (Laughter.) I am sure that the noble lord's motives are good, nor do I impugn the motives of other right hon. gentlemen; but they have always been consistent, and from the year 1840, from that Chinese debate which I had the pleasure of reading this morning, they have been, I may say, the hereditary enemies of the noble lord's policy. A high authority in this House has laid it down that "Enigland distrusts coalitions." I differed from my right hon. friend at the time because a coalition was then in full bloom, but I do not think now, from circumstances which have recently occurred, that coalitions will be very successful or popular in this House; but, however great their popularity or success here may be, sure I am that the public out of this House will never listenior give their assent to a conspiracy to displace the noble lord from power. (Cheers.)
Mr. HENLEY thought the House could not fail to bi greatly aniused by the speech which they had just heard. but he questioned whether they would derive any great in. formation from it (hear), for hardly one of the points on which he had touohed had any real bearing on the question at issue. (Hear, hear.) The hon. gentleman complained that Sir John Bowring had been called " a liar " but it was most surprising, considering the line which the ion. gentleman took, that ho had not gone so far as to state that this was not his opinion. (Hear, hear.) Not one single member all through the debate who had complained of this ep~ithettbeing applied to Sir John Bowring had ventured to deny the fact. In considering this question he had endeavoured to lay aside all party considerstlons. He ,asnot a memberof the peace party. Hewas not particularly fond of the oom member for the West Riding, nor had he ever had any political relations with him ; so that he could not be accused of any private bias in favour of the resolution. He was quite ready to admit that the House ought to decide upon the question as a jury, and he would even go somewhat further, and say that if there was any reasonable doubt the benef t of it ought to be given to the accused. (Hear, hear.) On the other hand, if the evidence laid before them should be so clear that a verusciox uneycoud no beavodeitwshirdy
die' Of guilty could not be avoided it-- wvst-heir- daut'y to give it without hesitation, however painful that duty might be. The hon. gentleman who had Just sat down had not adverted to the evidence at all. The witnesses whom he had called were all counsel in the case (hear), but the issue which the House had to decide must be decided on the papers laid on the table. This issue was exoeedingly clear and simple. On the one side they were asked by the motion to declare that the papers did not fullyestabhshasatisfaotory ground for the violent measures which had been used, and, on the other hand, the Government, by the despatches of Lord Clareundop, had cominitted themselves to an approval of thete meaores " for the judgment, firmnes, anhd moderation displayed, and for the respect shown to the lives and p tremtes of the Chinese." He cocnsidet cthatc at =h n id Aout the character of the Caineton. altogether fore to the subject, for he did net suppms that any one would contend that because te (CheI sigb vl and cruel we were on

The hon. member for Middlesex had ebAraterhoed the Chinese as ferecious because they had out ofl.some men's headsanid attempted to ?aoison the whole community of Hongkong but he might ave added ihat this ferocity commenced with the bemtardment of the ct
of CanftoD~. ("No, no!" from Mr. Osborne.) The hon. gentleman must give him (Mr. Henley) leave to rsy "Yes,

It had boon truly stasted tlit the. question turned uapon the cou-truoction *f the treaty. The Chines seized the crew of a vesse which Consul Parkes pretended was protected jinder the 9th"atcle of the treaty. Some corresipondence took place between Commissioner Yeh and Constul Parkes,
and then Sir 3. Bowring informed consui rarkes that t'ie vessel bAd no right to the British flag and was riot entitled to be regaded as a British veaseL. Some days Aftrward.?, Consul farkes, although acquainted with the fast that Sir J. Bowring did not consider the Arrow entitled to pr,.- tretion, claimed redress undler the 9th article of the treatyr, on account of the conduct p?ursued by the Chinese towarils the crew of that vessel. 'The correspondence continued until the 2&l or 24th of October, when the British authorities commenced re risals by eizing a Chinese junk, and they afterwar took'S and destroyed some three or four forts, mounting about 200 xuns, which were destroyed. NYow, he (Mr. Henley)ake whether the seizure and destruction of those forts was not a sufficient reprisal for the injury commaitted in the cms of the Arrow? (Hear, bear.) It had been said that the French and Aimerican authorities at Canton approved the course pursued bythe British represntatives. No member of the Government had, however, ventured to assert that the American or French authorities in China bad aprvd that course knowing that Sir T. Born a elrd the Arrow v7as not entitled to Brts rtcin(ear, hear); and unless it could be show tathaprvlwas given with A knowledge of the hlee i a fno accouint. (Hear, bear.) No,teAericana had been fellow-sufferers with us, adw tcorehad they pursued? They received at eater and a more direct insult than had been offered to te British flag. The boat of an American mnan.of -war, having the Axaerican flag iflying, was actually fired upon with round shot from a Chiniese fort. What was the course which the American Authorities deemed ityproper to adopt under such circumstances? They determlined to require and enforce reparation-lat, for the outrage comnmitted by the firing on their flag by t'he Barrer Forts; and, 2dly, for the firing on thle Unit-ed States' flag by the fortress at Heang-shan. They determined, if they fatled in obtaining redress for these grievances, to inflict becoming punshment on the Chinese, and to "1reserve the consideration of future measures." He must say ho thought that was a very spirited and prudent course. He considered that the destruction of the forts by the British forces was a sufficient punishment for the insult offered to the English flag, hut the question was complicated by further demands en the part of the British authorities. Sir.T. Bowring, it aperd iected Conisul P'arkes to raise what was called te v=of quycstio with respect to the entranceof foreigners into Canton under the treaty. The matter was placed in the hands of the British Admiral, but for some reason or otherhe did not see fit toraise the question. He (Sir Md. Seymour) did, however, raise another question closely connece with it, by demanding the admission into Canton, not of the whole English or foreign ublic, but of official personages, for the purpose of officl intercourse with the Chinese Government. He (Mr. Henley) must say it was by no means clea to him that that was a treaty right. That right of entry did not of itself contain the right of carrying' on official personal intercourse with the Chiniese authorities; but it did not stand alone, because in the treaty in which the right was givenx there was an article relating to the mode in -which correpondence was to take place. That was a proof that if there was to be personal intercourse it was not put into the treaty. (Hear.) Bat it was a right which the admiiral wished to enforce, and he proceeded to do so by battering down first one part, then another of the town, so that the loss of life was very great. There was nothing in the p p era that led himi to conclude e-ither that he Acted justly in emanding that right, or that he was justified in attempting to obtain it by such means. (Hear.)- Much had been said in the course of the debate of the distinction that had been drawn between the different officers now in China. He would not havre made any distinction with the mere view of casting more obloquyon one rrson than another; but when the papers showed on the ac of them that two of the perns concerned had stated what they knew to beuntrue he felt that It was an act of justic to the third party (Sir Id. Seymour) to say that there 'was not a word in the papers that gave A shadlow of belief that he was aware of those shameful untruths. (Hear hear.) If it was clear as the sun atnGonday that Sir J. Bowring and Consul Parkes had asserted in a formal docuraent to the Chinese a thing to be lawful that they had in another document said was not lawful; that they had said a certan vessel was entitled to protection, while under their own hand in another place they had said' it was niot entitled to protection ; And when he saw that the gallant officer (Admiral Seymour) had no knowledge of the falsehood, surely he was entitled to hold him entirely so-
qutted. (Hear, hear.) He rejoiced that no member of the O v.1ernment had attempted to deny that fuisehood - it was one of the reedeming features of this debate that tiley had not ventutred to do so. (Hear, hear.) Much had been said as to the effect of passing a reslution of the kind before the Rouse on officials on the other side of the water. He was entitled to say that the members on that (the Opposition)] side of the House had always shown a desire to support the Government in their dealings with foreiga States, but this desire they held with the onaiiainta they shouldI [not be asked to giveateirficoation thacts and circumstances that nothing could justify, and to things done under circumstances which ought never to have arisen. (Hear.) He hold that deliberate, wilful untruths could only be properly designated by the name of falsehood, and never could and never ought to be justified. (Hear, hear.) He said also that bringing the horrors of war without proved necesit upon non-comnbatant, defeuceeless women and children was a circumstance that it was scarcely possible to justify. (Hear, hear.) If he were in the jury-box, on his oath, he could come to no other conclusion than he had done with regard to these papers After the most strict and accurate reading of them in his power, he declared that he was una'ble to find in tbem any justification of what had taken place in China. (Hear, hear.) Nothing could possibly justify falsehood. If such a thing had been done by any gentleman, a memnber of that House, he could not again have shown his face among them, (Hear.) There was another circumstance that proved to him that the admiral was not very closely Informed of what was doing by the other
Artie. Sir J. Bowring, after thle more active hostilties Ead begun, sent a despatch to Consul Parkes, in which he stated that if Commissioner Yeh should make any proposition about referring the question as to the right of entry into the city to the Emperor he was to refuse compliance. He confessed he did not think it very creditable that such a reffrence to the Emperor on a question that had been in abeyace since 1849 should have been opposed if made, but, whether it was right or wrong, the orders to Consul Parkes on thepoint were positmve. Now, what was the condluct of Admiral Seymour? After this letter to Consul Parkes had been sent, the admiral poeddt aLttack a second time the forts, whichthCinsha
strongly fortified ; butbeoedigshewteote Chinese commander of tefrst a hti hygv them up to him without fgtn ewudhl hmI h same condition in which te eewtotdsryn~te -till when? Till the mate coudb eerd~ h Emperor. (Hear, hear.) This was a. ovnigpofta the gallant admiral was not aware thatCoslPreba
received instructions that even if the Commisioer wished to send to the Emperor he was not to be attended to. (Hear.) To his mind the most grievous part of these transactions stas the falsehood which they involvedl. When hesaw men in the most solemn acts which they could perform deliberately asserting what they kne-w to be untrue, he could place no reliance upon their statements. No attempt was mad .in any portioni of the correspondence to explain away the falsehood. It was repeated more than once, qualified, it was true, by the statemient that the Chinese were not aware of the real facts of the case; but that only made the offence ten thousanid times worse, (Hear, hear.) I1 have looked through these papers (c,ontinued the right hon. gentleman') with every disposation to find something that would relieve me from the necessity of voting with the hon. member for the West Riding.I see all the inconvenience that may result from the adoption of his resolution, though I think that inconvenience has been somewhat exagra'ted. Every account which Arrives now shows us that allth evils which could possibly ensue in China from a knowledge of what is taking placehere have already happened. We have drawn the sword withouLt any of those warnings which civilized nations ordinarily give. We have murdered untold numbers of persons, and, according to the list Accounts, the Chinese have begun to murder us, We complain that they ha-ve resorted to assassination and poisoning; have they no right to complain, on the other hand, that we have thrown shells amoing non-combatant, unoffending people? We have no information yet about what they are doing at the other four ports. I think it Is the duty of the Government to tell us what protection there is for British property and interests at those places. It is quite clear tbat the Chinese have taken what we have done as a declaration of war. It is as clear as the sun at noon-day that thepy would be fully
jstified in seizing our pro , burning our ships, and ki in ou eol..eh veunIed their war junks, taken their forts, destroyed their guns, and shelled their unoffend. ing people, and they in retaliation have fired our factories. I see no reason why they should naot seize our property and kill our people at the other four ports. After the treatmentthey have receivedat our hands they will inevitably do it, and I think, therefore, we ought to bear from the Giovernment whether, having had a fore. krowledge of what was likely to happen-for every line of the correspondence, the presence of a large naval force in those seas, and the fact that gboats are expeted cut
t~ebeyond the shadow of a doubt t'hat the Government Isew before hand that hostilities -were about to break, out in China-.tbev have provided adequate prtection for British - life and property at Nigp
Shangai, Wampoa andFoo-chow. It is stated Iin one of the papers that Britirsh interests aLppear to be safe at those places, and one of the Governors is reported to have used the expression, "1every mnan mnay sweep his own floor." But, though a subordinaste gvrnor,,,, -. ' fo .th.1
bie en ma holder thatmlaguage, it is very Possible that
he ma receive resfo the central authority not only to lokafter his own floor, butto take cabrge of those of his
neighbours; and, if so, British interegsrsaaYuffer verumate. rially in those quarters. I think also with the noble lord the member for the city, that we ought to hear from sonme member of the Government vwhat their futuro intentions pre with respect to China. We cannot, of course, exuact them to tell us what are the p recise terms whicb they mean to exact, but I think the House bas a right to be informed, as the matter is one of great gravity, and not likely to pass away like a sunmmer cloud, what is the probable course which events will take. (Hear, hear.) I cannot sit dowii without referring to the great pain which it has given me to be obliged to exprfss an opinion adverse to men who are servirg their country in a distant part of the earth. Nothing could have induced me to do so but circumstances so strong as those which I have stated to the House. I felt that no choice was left to me, for the Government having, bv the
probation they have given to the acts of our authorities in Chins, identified themselves with everything that has taken place there, it was impossible that we could consider the
tness and propriety of that approbation without discussing the acts to wbich it was extended. No man could be more fully aware than I am of the consequences which may come from the adoption of the resolution. I think, however, that those consequences are the less to be apprehended, because all the evils which could possibly happen have already taken place, while I can never consnt to share the responsibility of downright falsehood, or the unnecessary shedding of the innocent blood of non-comstants, (Cheers.)
lMr. tE. EGERTO.l, in annOunDCing hisi intention to vote against the resolution, sai4 it was with great pain he had
arveda h e oncusin tha twolehiuyto 1sea
i timacy. He was bound to state, at fte same time, that L.e did not concur in any one of the reasons wrhich the hon. member for Cornwall (Mfr. Kendall) had assigned for his ncte. (Bear, bear.) It was nothis intentionto g to the legal merits of the case before the House. The questirn he had aslked his own mind was-what would be the practical effect of the resolution if adopted? Tne House beard last night from a gentleman vho had been long in China that the state of things was dangerous in tbe *xtreme, and if that House were to convey to the people or China and to the British admiral, and other authoritisi vho were employed in checking the hostile proceedings o' the Chinese, tea idea that it sympathized with the actE o' the Chinese, he believed that te awords used by the Home Secretar, to the effect that British property and British life would be unsafe would prove no exaggerated expres. sion. (Hear, hear.J It was that consideration and that alone vhich made him give his vote most unhestatingiyt
the Government. (Hear, bear.) There were at stake large m>rcantile interests, which were every day developing into greater importance between this country and China- and he had hoped to hear from the noble lord at the heai of the Administration that it was the intention of the Government to satisfy public opinion by recalling Sir J. oawring, and sending out some plenipotentiary whose general character and weight might bring this ques tion to a fair settlement. Such a settlement this country must have sooner or later. (Hear, hear.) The country was now involved in a war which was likely to prove a disastrous war for some time, and, however averse he niight be to the horrors of war, Le believed that severity in the first instance would be mercy in the end. (Hear, hear.) If they stayed their hands now he was sure that the trada of the country would suffer to an extent almost dreadful to contemplate. The whole course of the conduct of the Chinese smce 1840 had been marked by bad faith and duplicity towards this country, and it was in the full belief that the present motion, if carried, would fetter the hands of those in a distant country who had a difficult and dangerous task to perform, that he must express his decidel opposition to it. (Rear, hear.)
Mr. J. PHILLTIDORE regretted the vote he was about to give, but it could not be attributed to any other motives than such as must influence a person who endeavoured to the best of his ability to come to a just dechion on the papers laid before Parliament. The vote he was about to give vould not be given in pursuance of party bias or poltical feeling. He could not forbear to comment on the very singular and, as he must call it, the most audacious speech of the hon. member for Middlesex. That hon. member said that the House might almost consider itself ajury, and thehon. member proceeded to address the House as if it was a jury of the most ordinary description, for not one single syllable did he utter on the yrave and serious part of the question under consideratio,. okes, about the good taste of which there must be considerable difference of opinion, misstatements of themost obvious facts, and allusions to the character of the Chinese, constituted the whole of the argument by which the hon. member endeavoured to divert the House from the consideration of topics which allimust be anxious properly to understand. lTobody enjoyed more than he (Mr. J. Phillimorel the di:play and the coruscations of wit on proper occasions, bat be regretted that wit bordering very closely on buffoonery should have been introduced on an occasion of this kind to bias the deliberations of the House. He would not dwell on the legal question, but should conteut himself with stating his conviction that in point of law the Chinese were completely right. The license was mere waste paper from first to last, and even if it had been valid frem first to last it could not make the ship a British ship. If the ship had been thouaht entitled to the privileges of a British ship, where was the necessity of its having a nominal owner? The Attorney-General, in the course of a most able speech asked whether the House would punish Sir J. Bowring for not knowing a point of law on which Lord Weusleydale and Lord Lyndhurst were at variance ? But the fact was that Sir J. Bowring declared that he knew the law, though he acted in defiance of it. (Rear, hear.) He should not give his vote in favour of the motionifhe thought a simple error only had been committes
and that there was no deliberate intention on the part of Sir J. Bowring to provoke a quarrel with the Chinese. (Hear, hear.) From the beginning to the end of the papers there was evidence of a ludicrous anxiety on the part of Sir J. Bowring to procure admission for himself into Canton. What were they at war for, and why was Canton bombarded? Simply and solely because the offended dignity of Sir J. Bowring was not sufliciently appeased by the manner in which his request for the return or the men was complied with. Was it posdble to vindicate a war based on such frivolous grounds ? (Hear, hear.) One of the arguments of the Lord-Advocate struck him as being very singular. It was this,-that as the injnry which had been done to us by the Chinese authorities was very triflinge that was precisely the reason why we should punish them severely, for that was the only way to deal with Orientals. That argument reminded him (Mr. J. Phillimore) of the words which were put into the mouth of a courtier in the time of Charles IL,-
"My wound is great because it is so small,
"And would be greater if it were not at alL"
The House had been warned that the passing a vote of censure uPon the Government would lead to results in China exceedigly prejudicial to British interests there- but would the adoption of the motion prevent the noble ford at the head of the Government from doing what was requisite for the protection of those intrests? Was it likely that the terrible destruction of Chinese lives and property would tend to increase the affection of the Chinese for us, or to enlarge our commercial intercourse with them? Was it likely that not only trade, but, as Eome would have it. Christianity herself would force a way amid the clash of bayonets and the thunder of artillery? Why, since the days of Pharaoh, whose understanding became darkened is his foolish heart hardened, there was no such instance of infatuation as that of those who looked for the extension of commerce and the spread of Christianity to bloodshed and havoc. TheVice-President of the Board of Tradehad asked the House whether they would be insensible to a dishonouring of the British flag. But by whom had it been dishonoured. (Cheers.) That flag was dishonoured when it was made a shelter for banditti and pirates, when it carried terror to the defenceless and destruction to the innocent, It was because he (Mr. J. Phillimore) would not be an accomplice to that dishonour, and would not countenance the volent proceedings of an upstart and arrogant Minister, that he intended to vote for the motion of the hon. member for the West Riding.
Mr. B. COCHRANE said, the speech of the right hon.
Secretary of State for the Home Department would almost. lead the House to believe that we had declared war in the name of civilization and had bombarded cities in the nam, of humanity. The right hon. gentleman assured the House that no damage had been done to the city of Canton by Her Majesty's forces. lNow, he lMr. B. Cochrane) happened to have received such information from those who had isited that city as would show that that was a mis-statement. Canton contained about 1,500,000 people, who were crowded together in a quarter of the space occupied by the same number of people in London. The streets of Canton were so narrow that two people could scarcely pass in them. The books which had been laid before the House showed that Canton had been bombarded at intervals for a period of six weeks. The destruction, therefore, of life and
roperty in Canton occasioned by our hostilities must have eoen horrible.The hon..member for Middlesex had attem ted to cast ridicnle upon a quotation made by the right hon gentleman the member for Wiltshire from a bio_ranhr of Sir Charles Napier; but therewas another passage in that work to which he (MIr. B. Cochrane) might take the liberty of referring,and which was to the effect that war could not be carried on with rose-water any more than revolutions and that we ought, therefore, to be sure that we were right before we enteredupon a war. "It is a terrible thinE" (said Sir C. Napier) '"to carry on an uniust war. We have taken Beyrout. It is sad work or nus. It is a cruel thing to batter down a town full of maen and women, of bed-ridden, old, and sick people." In that opinion every hon. member must concur. It had been argued that the Chinese were not to be treated as a civilized nation. That, although a terrible argument, wa4 the only one by which our proceedings in this case could be justified; but we were prevented from alleging it in our justification because we had by making treaties with them dealt with the Chinese as a civilized nation. Hle had known Sir J. Bowring while he was a member of that House and after reading tese papers he had been deeply impreseed'with thefeeling of vanity bylwhichhe was actuated. This, however, was not a question of the personal character of the actors in these transactions. The question was, whether our plicy tow=ards the Chinese had been a truthful, an honees
and a natinal policy. His answer to the question was, that ovr policy was consistent neither with truth nor humanity, and he should, therefore, support the motion.
Mr. T. CHAMBERS wished to explain the grounds on which be meant to vote against the motion before the House. He denied that the operations of our fleet would be fairly characterized as anmidiscrimtnate bombardment of an innocent and defenceless city, and referred to despatcbes in the blue-books to prove that care was taken to confine the work of destruction mainlyto the Chinese public buildimgs, and other places where the least harm would be done to the population of Canton. The House was now called on to perform a judicial act, and the motion must be construed as a vote of censure both on the home Govern. ment, which had done none of the things complained of, and on our representatives abroad, who had done those things. They were called upon to declare that Sir J. Bowring had, without a shadow of justification,
and as the result of his own personal errors, been guilty of the greatest atrocities known to modern times To judge fairly on so grave a cbarge, they were bound to place tlemselves, as far as possible, in the, position of the person against whom it was brought. While our own agents and merchants were stigmatized as the abett,rs and perpetrators of every enormity, aud the Chinese irn general, and Governor Yeh in particular, were held up is models of simDle purity and innocence, they started wrong in wbat oughf to be a judicial investigation and must ba landed in a wrong issue. The terms of the motion were mon,stroudy unjust. They asked the House, without expTessing any opinion how far the Chinese had given cause o f complaint by their non-falfilment of the treaty of 1842 to declare that the papers did not furniah satisfactory grounds for the measures taken in the case of the Arrow.
What was this but requiring them carefully to exclude froni their consideration every material fact which ought to
govern their decision? There could be no other interpretation of the maliciousmoderation of themotion than that. The hen, baronet the member for Hertfordshire (Sir B. Lytton) said that commerce should approach a nation comparatively simple and barbarous not oniy with justice, but with justioe arrayed in her mildest attributes. That was no doubt ^ beautiful sentiment, beAutifully expressed; bet ho could furnisll its author wit], a much better lay figure on which to bang his rhetorical drapery. It was forgotten that the treaty of 1842 gave us an undoubted right to enter Canton, ard that, although from that time to this we had always been strong enough to insist on the fulfilment of this atip. lation, yet for 15 years we had been content to knocl in vain at the gates of that city for admission. Surely
that fact afforded one of- the most signal ex&smple,
ever witnesied of mildness and forbearance on the Dart o' British traders. From a careful attention to the whole of the legal argument in this case he had'come to the concit-
osio that the Arrow was entitled to British protectiont But, of what consequence aas it whether we were right r not in the law of the questiop ? (Derisive cries of "Heau
wrong, and everthing tbat wss hostile to England was right. (Cheerm) The hon. gentlemen said that British merchant; were a set of haughty, overbearing, unraly, selfish, grasping, money-getting men, who, for their own selfish objects wera YPcrpetually engaging this country in disputes In the places in which they resided. Where has the hon. member acquired this knowledge of English merchauts! Was it in the ecurse of that continental tour which he made that he learned that English merchants were men so unworthy of their country? The hon. gentleman has said that he should not like to wrote over his counting-house the motto " Civis BRomanus umm;" if he wite up instead, "Iam a British lubject," that inscription would be held by those who knew bim to be untrue in spirit and at heart. (Cheers,) The bon, gentlema said that the Government of England a re bulies to the weak and cowards to the strong; and that was said at the close of a war with Russia, one of the greatest Powers of the cvilized world (cheers),-a war under. *aken in obedience to every principle of justice and right, and carried on, in spite of all difficulties, with an energy and a courage which woould have done honour to any nation on the face of the earth, (Cheers.) But the hon. gentleman pointed the object of his remark. He said,
'Would you have done this to the United States 2" EHe meant that we were cowards towards the United States And this was a member of the Peace Society (cheers), who taunts us with having made a friendly arrangement with a kIndred People, an arrangement which was honourable to us and was aecepted with cordiality by them. The hon. member, forsooth, taunts us for not having made the events to which he alluded the canse of a breach and of a war with thoUnited StatesE He says that you are cowards becausa you maintain friendly relations with the people of the United States, with whom, as men of spirit and men of courage, you ought to have gone to war. (Renewed cheering.) So much for the reasoning of this member of the Peace Society. (A. laugh.) The illustration which he used was asingularlyunfortunate one for his argument. He said, how different was your conduct towards the United States upon a question which might have led to a difference between you from that which yau have pursued in China. There was a law passed in South Carolina according to which your coloured subjects were, if they came into the port of Charleston, put into prison and kept there until the vessel in which they hai arrived was ready to depart. This, said the hon. gentleman, was a gross outrage which would naturally hurt the susceptibilities of the English nation; and what did you do? Your consul at Charleston made an application to your Minister at Washington; your Ministr went tothe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and the matter was arranged. Redress eonld n6t be given, but reasons were assigned why it was not in the power of the Federal Government to give such redress, and the matter was settled without an *ppeal to arms. Why, Sir, if we had had a linister at Pekin who could have addressed himself to the servants of the Emperor, no doubt a similar result would have followed, and this and other local difficulties would have been surmounted and accommodated without difficulty (hear, hear); and that shows the value of the demand which has been made by the Admiral for personal intercourse, at least, with the authori. ties of Canton. (Hear, hear.) It is manifest that if 3omr officials had the right of communicating directly with the local authorities-still more if there was diplomatic communication with the central Government, the difficulties which otherwise swell into quarrels would soon be arranged, and mutual interests would bring about a mutual and amicable aceommodation. Let us inquire what was the event which has given rise to these unfortunate occurrences. I will not go into the legal question. I think that much of the legal argument as to whether the lorcha was or was nota aritish vessel would have been very proper if this case had been before the Court of Admiralty or the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council upon a question whether this ship, having been captured by an enemy of England or of China, was or was not a legal prize and liable to be condemned; but I hold that that dissertation, however interesting it may have been,and howevervaluable andimportaut may be the legal knowledge which has been brought to bear upon this question in both Houses of Parliament, does not touch the bottom of this matter. (Hear.) We have a treaty with China, and that treaty says that British vessels shaUl not be boarded and men taken out of them without a previous application to the British Consul. The whole question is, what did the Chinese know and believe this vessel to be ? (Hear, hear.) Did they or did they not consider her to be a British vessel? I say that they did. (Hear, hear.) The whole question turns upon that, and when it is said that it was a falsehood on the part of Sir John Bw3ring when he said that the Chinese Government did not know that the license had expired, I say that that was really the gist of the whole case, and tha%, instead of this being a flagitious attempt at imposition, it was a statement of the principle upon which the question between the British and Chinese authorities was to be adjusted. If the Chinese, knowing and believin-vwhether rightly or wrongly believing-that this was a British vessel, nevertheless in violation of the treaty boarded her, carried off her crew, and hauled down her colours, I say that it is immaterial to the question whether by the technicalities of the law you can show that at that moment she had not a right to be proteocted. The animus of an insult, the aniTaus of violation of the treaty was in the Chinese (cheers). and you had a right to demand not only an apology for the wrong that was done, but an assurance that it shonld not be repeated. But I think it has been shown that in point of fact this vessel was to all intents and purposes entit ed to the protection of the British flag. Although the license had expired five days, yet the register was good until the return of the lorcha to her port. Why, Sir, I never before heard such a quibble as that by which it is maintained that the lorcha was not at tea because she was in the river at Canton. (Cheers) Sir, I was ashamed, in a serious argument in this 'House, to see a distinction of that kind taken. The provision that the register should continue good while the vessel was at eea means of course that it should be in force as long as the voyage in which she was engaged kept her out of ber port and the miserable distinction between per being ht sea anr
bein ina river I certainly did not expect to hear taken in this Ho.se (Hear, hear.) What, then, is the history of the Arrow? Why, that she had a valid register- that she went to Macao, where she took in a cargo -nd that she conveyed part of that cargo to Canton. Wat does she there, and what must she have done according to established regulation? She must have deDosited, and did deposit, her register with the Brifish consul, who thereupon communicated with the hoppo, to obtain permission for the landing of her cargo. That permission was given, and the cargo was landed. Iteconsisted of rice, There was tO pretence that it _as contraband; and it must have been landed with the cognizance of the Cnstomhouse officers of Canton. The vressel lay five or six days opposite that town; and I saythat theChinese authorities must have known that she was a British vessel engaged in a legal trade-that she had not violated any Chinese law, and was therefore entitled to the protOetion which the 9th article of the treaty afforded her. Nevertheless, theychoose, in contravention ofEthat treaty, at the moment whenshei was about to sail, to board her and carry off her crew. The question has been raised whether the British ensign was tying. We have the evidenoe of Kennedy, the master of the Arrow, and also of Leach, the master of the Dart, who being both within 50 yards of the lorcha at the time, state that they saw the flag hauled down from ihe mizen-peak by a mandarin soldier, andalikewise-an important point that has not been sufficiently dwelt uponthat they saw the blue-peter hauled down. (Hear, hear.) I say this is important, because it is an answer to one of tne main arguments of Yeh, who states that the loreha could not have had the Bntish ensign flying, inasmuch as no vessel is allowed to hoist British colours from the moment she casts anchor until the moment she is about to get under way. Why, she ws about to get under way. Everybody knows that the blue-peter is a sign of immediate departure. The master was preparing to go on board, and the Arrow would probably have been under way within a few minutes afterwards had not the Chinese officers come and boarded her. Then another excuso is that there was no foreigner on board, and therefore they did uot believe she was a British vessel, but concluded that she must be Chinese. True, there was no forcigner on board at the time when the Chinese officials entered ier, butthen the master went on board with two other British subjects before they left the ship, and he was actually on board while they were stillalongside. Could there havebeen any doubt in their minds that he was on board ? Why, Kennedy, knowing enough Chinese to communicate with them in their own janguage, represented to them the injury they would do himn if they took away the whole crew; and he asked them to leave him two of the men, and they did leave him two, in consequence of his own special application. I say, then, away with the excuse-the fIlsehood-tbe "flagitions falsehood" (hear hear)-that there was no British ensign flying and no foreigner on board the lorcha at the time when the men were taken away. Well, wfhat was the plea urged in defence of the course they werer pursuing It was qnite different from the aUe etion subsequently put forwardby Yeh when he had got evidenco bettersuited forhis purpose. The excuse given by the officer conmanding the party was, that there was on board

(Laughter.) As for the red turban, I dont know whether that is a distinguishing mark sfffieient to enable one to say whenever he meets a person wearing it that he is a pirate, and ought to ha seized. The tale, however, is that while sailing up the Canton river the accuser paed the lorcha, the Arrow, and identified on board of her the very man whom he could otherwe only know by oberig that he bad loot a front tooth. They say that eyesight is keener andquickerinwa-rm climates than In these colder regions; but I think the sean who oonld distinguish in rspidly passing another 'vessel in & river whether one man o' the crew had or had not lost a front tooth is a man whom I should hke to sea
I: lsxt every principle, an4 connected himself with almost every party, tho noble lord has raised X wrarning voice to.maght against coalitions, because bie fears tbat a majority oE the Hlouse of Commons, ranking in its numbers some of ihe most eminent membersof the Hlouse-men who have been colleagues of die noble lord-mAY not approve a policy with respect to China which has beguu in outrage, and wbich, if pursued, will end in ruin. (Loud cheers.) Tbat, Sir, is the position of the noble lord. And what defence of that policy have we had from the noble lord ? Has he lai E down a idngle principle on which our relations with China ought to depend ? Has he enunciated a solitary political maxim which should guide us in this moment of peril and perplexity ? On the contrary, he has covered a weak and shambling cse by saying-what ? -tbat he is the victim of a conspiracy. (Cheers and laughter.) It's the old story. Bow often does a prisoner at the bar, when he is in the unfortunate position of having no defence, declare that the whole thing is a conspiracy? (Cheers.) The noble lord was singularly inconsistent in the language wbich he addressed to the House. He carefully enumerated the various influential sections which are combined against him. He alluded to the different distinguished staWesmen who, disagreeing on other subjects, agreed in their opinion of his policy. He did not enter into any manly or statesman"ike defence of his conduct. He reproduced petty observations made in the course of the debate which I thought reaUy had become exhausted and obsolete, and then he turned round and said that the whole was a conspiracy! (Cheers.) Accustomedto majorities which have been obtained without the assertion of a single prnciple, w-hich have, indeed, been the consequence of an occasional position, and which have, in fact, originated in the noble lord's sitting on that bench without the necessity of expressing an opinion upon any subject, foreign or domestic, that can interest the heart of the country or influencethe opinion of the nation, the noble lord will at 1lst find that the time has come when, if he be a statesman, he must have a policy (cbeers); and that it will no' do, the instant that the blundering of his Cabinet is detected, and every man accustomed to influence the opinion of the House unites in condemning it, to coraplain to the country that he is the victim of a conspiray. (Cheers.) Lot the noble lord not only complain to the country, but let hins appeal to the country. (Chieers.) I hope that my constituents. will return me again; if they do not, I shall be most happy to meet him on the hustings at Tiverton. (Renewed cheers.) I should like to see the programme of the proud leader of the Liberal party-IINo reform, new taxes, Canton blazing, Persia invaded." That would be the programme of the statesman who appealstoagreat nation as tbe worthy lewderof tbe cause of progress and civilization. (Cheers.) I hope that the House will notfora moment be influencedby thelanguidrocnace of the noble lord. Ihoye thathon. memberswili feei tonight that they have a dnty to performi whicb will hc remembered long after this Parliament shsZ ave ceasee to exist; and that, not frightenedlytlse menac- .n X li in. r
they will dare to vindicate the cause of ;u, ; i u

Mr. COB DEN.-Aa I h-ave beei. personally referred to during tbef our nights of the debate by many spealkers, and as much has been erroneously attributed to me, I trust that I may claim the indulgence of the House for a few minutes wrhile I replly to them. I have been accused of ungenerous language towards Sir John Bowring. Now, I stated that I had 20 years' acquaintance with Sir J. Bowring, and that I would rather not refer revengefully or harshly to him, and the only epithet which I applied to his unfortunate deSpatches was that in which I described one of them as the most flagitious publc document which had been ever published. I repeat those words, and I am sorry that a sense of dutv compels me to do so. (Cheers.) The noble lord at the head of the Goveriment remarked upon my conduct to foreigners and to my own countrymen, and characterized it as anti-English. (Cries of " Hear, hear," from behind the Treasury benches.) Will that very small knot of gentlemen up in that quarter (pointing to the rear of the Treasury benches) cease to proclaim the nakeLias of the land by interrupting me? because, though I know there will be a very large vote for the Government upon the occasion, those feeble cheers show that there is not very much heart In the business. (Cheers.) If the House wiUl give me its attention I promise to be very brief. (Hear.) The noble lord characterized my conduct as anti-English. He describced me as being very prone to take the part of foieigners; and in the same breath the noble lord said that posterity would regard me with some degree of consider. ation for having rendered some service to my country. I thought there was some inconsistency in that statement, and I do not understand how posterity could regard with favour one who abandoned his own countrymen and sided with foreigners. (Hear, hear.) There are some people who suppose that the noble lord's motives of action are not always the best, and part of the press believe him to be actuated by aimost treason in his public conduct. (A laugh.) The noble lord therefore should be himself dissnclined to fix on men false motives and unworthy objects. My only motive of conduct in this House is to promote the just interests of my country, be]ieving them to be in h%rmony with the interests of the whole world. (Cheers.) The noble lord has referred again to my remarks with respect to British merchants, and with that dexterity he knows so well how to employ has attributed to me all sorts of aspersions on the character of British merchants. Now, I made no disparaging reference to British merchants as a body. (Cries of "Oh! ") I spoke of certain morchants at Liverpool, represented by Mr. Cbarles Turner, chairman, who, in tne name of the East India and China Association, sent a memorial to Government recommending the Government to insist on the opening to foreign trade of any port on the coast of China or on any navigable river, and on placing consuls at them, and, moreover, desired that our ships of war should have free navigation and access to aU ports and rivers in China. SHear, hear.) I say that such a document applied to an mdependent and great em pire was never before published to the world. (Cheers.) With respect to the language I used, it was applied, not to the merchants of Liverpool generaly, but to the persons who exDressed such sentiments; and Isny such language isworthy of reprobation. (Hear, bear.) The noble lora has stated that but for theseunfortunate events at Canton the Government had mnade represesentations to the Government of France, and was about to make them to America, with a prospect of success, for a joint representation to Pekin in ravonr of greater commercial facilities with China. That is an important disclosure, and tends immensely to aggravate the misconduct which has led to those unfortunate events. (Hear, hear.) Is there now a prospect of such an arrangement being made ? I speak advisedly when I say I believe that America will not be a party to any combined action with the Government of this country on the basis now taken up in China. Wbat does the noble lord want with another treaty with China? He tells us that he believes the reason why so few of our manufactures enter China is that there are internal duties and obstacles which prevent their circulation inland, Vell, this may be true; but I think that he is mistaken. I think that a country which shows such an almost unparalleled ifreedom at her ports, that puts no restriction on shipping, that gives such facilites for the carrying on or business, is not very likely to put obstacles in the way for the purpose of preventing the circulation of manufactured goods in her interior. But if that is the reason why we send no more goods to China now than before the war of 1840-viz., to the extent of only 1,250,0001. per annum, does the noble lord think that the bomb,ardment of Canton will tend to remove those ob. structions in the interior of China of which he complains? The great grievance in this affair is that you are carrying on hostliti.es now without any definite object, and no possible good can arise from them. The noble lord has told us, with the view of alarming us, that if a vote adverse to the Government should be given to-night the results will be most disastrous all over the world, and particularly in China, where British lives may be destroyed out of revenge by the Chinese. But we have no resid nts at Canton, and by the latest information which I have received on this subject all the English residents in the south of China have taken refuge at Hongkong, and the danger is that as In that place scarcely anything is grown they wiU be st2rved for want of provisions. I presume, however, that there is no danger of their bemg massacred by the Chinese, as you must bave sent out reinforcements sufficient to protectthem. Those reinforcements wiiU be able to protect the British residents in the north as weU as in the south of China. It seems to me that all the mischief that could be done has been already done, for have they not burned down the factories and all the mercantile residences at Canton? 8,C00 or 10.000 houses have been destroyedthat iS to say, the residences of about 30,000 or 40,(G0 inha-
ants. All this mischief is done, and a vote of this House cannot make the matter worse. The noble lord predicts that terrible dangers would result from a chance of Ministry; but we all remember that in the midst oi the last Cbinese war, in 1840, Sir Robert Peel was carried into power, -and yet we do not find that British interests in China suffere by that change of Ministry, for the war was in fact, carried on more fiercely than before. The noblo lord has found fault with the terms of my motion, which ho says were dictated by a combination of parties; but I beg to state distinctly that no one in this House, with the exception of my right hon. friend the member for Hanchester (Mr. lf. Ghsou), was consultedby me with rerdt
the terms of ny moticn. Neither directly nor indirectly, w3sany intimation givenof my motion toanyhon. gentleman epFosite, or in any other part of the House, with the exception of my right hon. friend. I challenge contradiction of that assertion from any and every quarter. (Cheers.) How then, can the noble lordoharge me with entering into a con. spiracy todrivehiu from office? Hehas talked about party combinations, hut why has he not had the boldness to tell the House that I caLnnot hope to gain anything by a change of binisry ? I sball not take offle in consequenc of an change of Ministry, nor do I hope or expect tat the d y sion onm notion wil lead to that cha-nge of Ministry
ofwhch the noble lord has so much dread. But even if that should be the result of my mnotion I do not think that a change of Minitry would be any great calamity, (Laughter.) DurinV he 17 orn1 years that I have had asmat in this ~ouse I know that, wlhenever a change of Ministry is ex.pected these wh o are interested in supporting the existing Ministr
are all on the qui vive-they tell us that Heavent and ear7t
will come together if the draaded change should happen. And I never knew a change of Government where the people did not gain something by it. (Laughter and cheers.) And
I will tell the Elouse what will be the resut of a chaup of Ministers. I take it for grpnted that either the right bof
gentlemanoPPosite (Mr. Disraeli) or my ri%ht hor. friend near me (Mtr. Gladstone) will be Chanoe orof theEx chequer. Now what will be the effect? They wi take that budxet and reconsider it, and we shall hive a reduction of 2,000,000g. in the expenditure. Now, the noble lord (Pal.
merston) sometimes dealt somrehard blowts at me, but there ias m uch polish in his thrusts that it is impossible for ma to be angry with him. (Cheers.) No person iu this Rouse baa fewer eriemies and I am. iot among themn. (Hear.) Yet I wi tell the noble lord esodidly that T ahoulsi
snakea rnost e lieUet bargaih for the cotrntz if I disposed
Common's cam give A conscientious opinon u4on the pro-' ceedings Of YOutr Executive Government without az%Y injulry tc? the publio inittrests."1 (EHear, hear.) What w'.e4 the resir4utiots of the bon. member for the West Itiding? Ithadi been arroneously called an abstr-Act resolution. There wasr otothing abstract about it; on the contrary, it was a practical reply to the inTitation of the Government for an expression of their opinion. His hon. friend said that, having heard the case whiclh the Government had laid before the House, he was of opin-ion that the papers failed to establish sulficient grounds for the violent measures adopted at Canton in the afiar of the Arrowv. Could the Government be saidl lo have proved, either by their speeches or their papers,. thaLt the bombardment of Canton was an act of positive necessity ? If they entertaineda doulbt whether these acts of violence which had taken place were necessry, they ouight to vote w%ith the hon. miember for the West Riding; for, by negativing his motion the House would volunteer to share in the responsibility, now rolely res$ing on the Governmnent, of all the proceedingsi in China. (Hear, hear.) The right lien, gentleman, the Home Secretary, had stated that if the House earrned the resolution the most disastrous consequences would happen in China, and that every English resident would feel that his life was unsafe from day to day after the news arrived there. Surely it was not meant that urotection fur British life and property would he withdrawvn if the resolution passed, or that if it were negatived, the Chinese would not do all in their
p eragainst British life and property a-fter the boTnbment of Canton ? He imagined that t-hat staten-ent of the Home Secretary was inconsiderate-that it fell from him, perhaps, in the excitement of the delivery of w~hat had the character of a purely party spjeech. The House had been told that the merchants were in favour of
the course which had been pursued, and they mnust k-now
what was right. But was it intended to be maintained that the mercantile body of England was in favour of the policy pursued in China ? The British merchants at Canton were wome hundreds in number, and their opinions coulid not be takIen as an indication of the views of the great mercanatile bodly of the united kingdom. He had the honour to represent a most important city of manufacturers and consumers, and he had received no conmmunication from his constituents in favour of the policy pursued in China. The only intimationx which had reached him was one proceeding fromi a publicrmeeting of the inhabitants of Manc'hester, and he
ha presente the memorial agreed to at that mneeting to the Homeg Secretary in order thaLt he might lay it beore Her Majesty. Through the medlium of that mnemorial, the inhabitants ofManichester, in public uleeting a&sembled, conveyed to Her Majesty the feelings of shame and indignatioia with which they had learned the news of tho destbruction by the British forces of innocenit life at Canton, and their belief, founded an the published evidence, that the hostile Acts committed by Admiral Seysnour,with the concurrence of Sir J. Bowring and Mlr. Park-es, could not be justified on the plea of necessity, and were worthy of the heaviest censure. They observed that Her Majesty's prero-
gaieto declare war had been usurped by the beforemnen. tindservants of the Crown, and they imp,lorecl that they might be recalled, int or-der that a searching inquiry should be mnade inito their conduct. It therefore appeared to him that it was not correct to identify theo opinion efta small limnited body of genitlemen connected with the opines and tea trade in China with the opinion of the general mercantile community of England. (Hear, hear.) Iet the Rouse not forget that there might be arch a thing as immiediate interests biasing opinion. It was said that the stor-kof tea wa-s never so large as at present, and he could easily conceive that the individuals connected with the tea trade maight imagine that their immediate interest would be served by anythinig which wouldl have the temporary effect of giig increased value to their stocks. Who complained, during the recent war, that the blockade of the ports of the
atic was not sufficiently rigorous? They were decla-red to be owners of large stocks of Baltic produce, who wanted to keep out competition. (Rlear, hear.) Therefore, without charging against this body of gentlemen, who had been referred to aLs a p rovng the proceedings in China, that they were al cutd by interested motives, yet, as a mani of comnmonL sense, he was bound to take into consideration, circumstances affecting their interest. And had not those who consumed tea a claim to ho considered in this matter? (Hear, hear.) The impression amnong those with whom he had conversed was, thaLt the onily way to extend the Englishi trade -with China was by increasingthe consumption of ten in this country, and that could
Qybe done by lowering the duties oni tea, andl not by raising them as proposed by the Chancoellor of the Exchequr (Hear, hzear.) Increasing the consuinption of tea Nvoulderdo more to extend the trade with Chins than would ever be accomplished by the bomtbardimeat of a comnmercial town or by any measures of hostility. (Cheers.) It was urged that it might be very well to support the member for the West Riding fronti the conviction that he was right, but tha-t the state of parties miust helook-ed to. Now, hevwould miake what might sea-m a peculiar reinark, but nothing gave him so much confidence that it was right to support the present mnotion as the fact that the gre..t body of the Conservative party were about to support it. Why did hesay that! Because the Conservative party as rule supported the Crown during- wars anda hostilities. This
was ot aque-ionwhich involved distinctive principles beteentheLibralparty, as it %s-as called, andI the Conservative party. Tishis was a question which had been throwrn among all the members of that House, and upon which every memiber, without any reference to his political opinions, was enxtitled to pronounce a deliberate opinion. The Conservative party generall supported the Governmacnt of the daiy in foreign conmplficaions, and especially when actual hostilities had commenced. The case must then he strong indeed when gentlemen on the Opposition sieo h ouse (who, he believed, had considered it as fully and as free from party ties as any other gentleinen in the House) were willing to pass a disapproving vote as to the policy of the Government writh reference to the hostilities at Canton. Instead.then, of t,he suipport which the Conservative party had givei t-o the motion being an a.g utnent against it, he believed that it wa% rather a proof of its pro-
prety anid justice. When the noble lord aLt the head of the L5overnment was in any difriculty he made no scruple of accepting the vot-s of the Conservative against the Liberal party. (Hear, hear.)i When it was necessary to put down the hen, member for the Tower Hamlets on his question of church-rates, or the hen, member for Bristol on the ballot, or the hion, member for Surrey on the extension of the franchise -all of whichi Z,uestious lay at the ver-y foundation of the principles of the irlpat-the noble lord at theo head of the Go vernmnent was not squeamish about accepting the support of the Conservative party. (Cheers.) Well ten. when the hen. miember for thieWest Riding brought forward a motion consistent with all the views which he had entertained and professed in his pu'blic life, was he to be deterred froim asking the support of his friend.; because memibers of the ConserZa tive party forsooth would support it ? He (MNr. 11. Gibson) had been told that there was a mneeting of theo Liberal pai~y lately at the residence of the noble lord. lie read the report in the public newspapers-for it seemed now to he the fashion to pu'ilish in the journals reports of these private polit~ica meetings. (Hear, hear.) That mneeting was rc
wakbemore for the absence of certaini distinlguished menu than for the presence of those who attended it. lie read over the naines, and he must say that it was t-he first time he ever recollected a meeting of the Liberal party .being held -without the name of Lo)rd J. nussel apern am g those who attended it. (Hear, hear. ) There were other distinguished namnes which were not to he found in the list of those present at that meeting. He should like to know what the noble lord at the head of the Government said to his hon. friends who attended the meeting? (U%ugliter.~ What pledges were given, what inducemuents were held out
'When sufficient inducements were held out oni such occasions many a member, for the puirpose of saving a Ministry in danger, gave a vote that was no~ exactly according to his
convictions. (ERear, hear.) He rend in the newspaprs
that one thing stated at the meeting was that the noble lor at the head of the Government was a man of extra3rdinary luck (lauphter), andl that it would be well for those present to give ham their support. Well, now, he (M1r. 11. Gibson) sbould think that the Canton and the P'ersian difficulties were no proof that good fortune bad attended the career of the noble lord. He believed that the can-se of these foreign complications was to be traced to what the hon. and learned mnember for Sheffield called the mischievoni actirity of the unotile lord, who interfered in all parts of the known world. (Hear.) What were they to inscribe upon their banner if they were to goto a general election, as had been threatened intime event of this motion being,carried? They must h&.ve a political banner of some kind wi,trhnwhich to go to the country. They were told that the name of Lordl'alinerston was a tower of strength. He (Mr. Gibson) doubted that. (Hear, hear.) Could they pu. on their political banner the old motto, "Peace, Retrenchment, Reorrna ? (Laughter.) W"ould they be able to stand upon the bombardnment of (i anton and no reforin? (Laughter.) He concurred writh his lbon. friend the mnember for the West Riding its thinking that if they were to ask the country to give the LibeRal party increased ~pwer, in order to enable them to carry on the administration of public affairs, they would be obliged to pick uap some new principles for that party, and to inscrebe on their banner something more thaci was indicated at the polltieal mneeting that was held at the residence of the noble lord. He (Mr. Gibson) felt at liberty to make thes statements, for he could assure the House that the premanre-the disagreeable pressre-that wasput upon hon.
gentlemen to seduco them to change their votes upon this iniportant question (loud cries of "hear, hear") was of a cbaracter that could only he equalled by the pressure put upon voters at a smaU provincial contested election in order to compel them to vote in this or that direction. (Cbeers.) Now, hon. gentlemen were at liberty, vith a due re gard to the public interests, and w ithout being in the least afraid of the deluge coming upon them if the Government should experience some difflculty on this occasion, to pronounce their conscientious opinion upon tho motion of the hon. meisther for the West Riding. They had been told that the hostilities at Canton were necessary, hut why had no attempt been made at the commencement of the dispute to refer the question of tho lorcha to the Emperor of China? (A langh.) That laugh no doubt meant that such a reference was impowible. Why, then, did Sir J. Bowring threaten Commissioner Yeh with a complaint of his conduct to tho Emperorof China if he did not alter his conduct? (Laugh. ter). That threat assmed that Sir J. Bowring had the power of crrying it into effect, and nothing appeared to be more natural. There were no men to be rescued, and no property to be got out of the hands of tho Chinese. The onlr question that remained to be settled was about a doubtful construetion of a particular treaty. But the commnenoement of hostilities rendered it most difficult for the Emperor of Chiaa, whatever might be his wishes, to interfere pacifically in the matter. What, tben, were we to fight for nowt I e hoped that before this debate closed Her Majesty's Govermnent would state to the HOUFewhat were tho precise objects for which vse were nowr to fimt, and what were the terms which they considered to be suflieleit to satisfy our wounded honour? He saw tbat reinforcementa were to be seat out. He hoped, therefore, that the noble lord at the bead of the Govern-ment wculd gaTe the House somne idea of the expenditure that this war with China would ntaLU. (Hear, bear.) WitcGut hbat iDformation the tase would b*e very incomplete. A letter had been put iDto his (tr. IL Oibsoaa's) hauml which botr
upotr VhAt waa calleA thb 1;v of this question, TIsat Ws & sibie'A Opon Wh I it id not rtsrgut to Fits k ogra
but the letter referred to a legal authority, which ntfirply confirmed tho opimion of Lord Lyndhurst as to theillegaity of any attempt to nationalize vessels as against the rights of other Contries. The opihion which ihe -as about to read was that of a practica an, now adininiserin in our c urIs of justce the partico]ar lasss bearing upon t questont-h alUnded to Dr. Lushington. (Rlear, hear.) Nowr, Dr. Lushsngton, in the Admiralty Court, In the case of " Tbe Soglasie, " gave tire follo WiDg judgment:-
"It is siot sompetent to any State by its own particular regulatiozeat ence to c%engp a national charzater to the detriment of other States. It may give local rights and piivilegeP, it man confer al those benefith which are within its own jrmisdistiors, but I a* of ovinion that it cannot alter the rights of others."
Therefore it was 2X6 quite trathat noble )ords and hon. gentlemen connected with tbe lexal profession gave opinions tinply in accordance wvith their ?olitical opinions, for here was a judge who laid dewn. arule so entireaccordance with the views of those who, supported thiLs nuotior. He (Mr. G(ibson) would not go over ground which had been so. often traveUed over by other hon. members, but lie wold tell tbe Governmenit that the feeling which he had heard expressed, and which was to be fonud in most of the provincial newspapers, and in all the London ones, with one- or two. except ons, was that Her Majesty's Government-and he said Ber Majesty's Government, because he declined to. give any opinion as to the conduAt of Sir Ji. Dvwr.ng and Mi. Consul Parkes, seeixg that the Government had most loyaUy and most properly Adopted the conduct of thote gentlemen. (Mlinisterial cbeering. He,
eliheved they were all vrong together, but he shoiald have thought it extremely shabby, he shouia have thought it a. meanness of which no one would be capable, if, having approved and encouragod the conduct of Sir John Bowring, the Governuient had at the last moment. ssade a scapegoat of him and thrown him over in order to save themselves. (Hear, hear.) The feeling generaUy expressed both by tha provincial and the London press, anid by those with whom he had conversed upon this subject, was that in this matter Her DIajesty's Government had showci a too zealous sensitiveness, and had seen insults on tho part of the Chinese when no one else had perceived them; that they had eahibited indifference to the blood which had been shed, and had treated this difficulty as if upon every offence from a. foreign country we were at once to fly to arms and raise the cry for blood. This was the feeling of those witht 'whom he had communicated upon this subject. It was not that they did not wish to see British interests proteeted and the British honour vindicated, but they believed.
Ibat the Government had from the commencement of these, ostiities exhibited an indiderence which was not becoming those who administered the affairs of an enlightened anda Christian country. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. B. OSBORNE.-I was not surprised by tho two. speeches which have proceeded from the other side of the House, for, although at first sight it appears very extraordinary that Lord Raglan and the Crimean campaign, and still more extraordinary that the noble lord's appointments to the bench of bishops, should be introduced into a Ch inese discussion, still, when I consider how this debate has been mystified, hovr it has been obfuscated by the opinions and speeches of the numerous lawyers who have worried this subject (a laugh), and who have plunged it into a morass fronm which it is very difficult for a plain man to extricate it, I do not wonder that the two honourablo gentlemen opposite should not have been very well aware what is the subject under discussion. For my own part, I would entreat the House, in the language used by my right hon. friend the member for Carlisle (Sir J_ Graham) on a former occasion, to have done with nisi prius, at least for to night, and to discuss this question upon broader grounds. (Hear, hear.) In my humble opinion, this matter resolves itself into two questions:-Were Sir John Bawring, Mr. Consul Parkes, and Admiral Sir Uichael Seymour justified in taking the course which they have adopted, after delberate consideration of what had taken place, they being upon the spot? and are Her Majesty's Ministers deserving of censure for their support and approval of their officers ? I was much surprised to find that a right hon. gentleman, lately Secretary for War (Mr. S. Herbert), in his s,pcech last night, endeavoured to draw a distinction between Sir MUichael Seymour and Sir John Bowring. Although lic said that he had no acquaintance with that gallant officer, he gave him credit for a humanity which I know belongs to him, and for a bravery in which he has not an equaL. Bt why did the right hon. gentleman thus praise the gallant admiral ? In order that he might blacken the character of Sir John Bowvring (hear, hear) ; not that he had any great love for the gallant admiral, but because lie had so strong a wish to decry Sir John Powsring that he determined to draw a contrast between them. IHe went further. He accused Sir John Bowring of having by this deception forced him into the linep which he took. The right hon. gentleman is labourinz under a complete misapprehension of the facts. Sir Michact Seymour was in coniplete possession of Sir John Bowring's intentions; and, although I have a great objection to read anything from a blue-book, and am sure that the House mnst be ready to faint at the sight of this one, I will quota the letter of Sir John Bowrinig, in which he says he is glad to find that I 'there is a perfect conocrrence of opinion as to, the course of action between the admiral and myself." It is very wel for the right hon. gentleman to say that he
has found other things in tho appendix; but I tell him that' this is the fact, that the gallant admiral entertained exactly the same views as Sir John Bowring, and acted concurrentlywith him upon those views. But, says the right hon. gentleman, he bombarded the city; and really from the speeches vwhich we have heard to night and on other occasions it would seem as if Canton had been laid in ashes. (Hear, hear.) Ho v stands the fact? The city has not beem bombarded. Those sh-lls which the right hon. gentleman described so graphically as being pitched in every five minutes were confiued to a certain portion of the city (Opposition cheers and laughter.) I repeat the assertion, founded both upon private letters and upon public doeuments, that the,se shells were thrown into a certain part of the city, when the Chinese attempted to burn down the factories, in order, if iossible, to save the buildings and prevent their being plandered. The right hon. gentleman even IoOk exception to the attack upon the high commissioner's house, and quoted a passage, I think, from Sir C. N apier's biography with regard to an attack by a picket upon Marshal Xey and his suite. I was surprised at this, because I could perceive no analogy between 31arshal Ney and the high commissioner, between the French marshal and the Tartar chief, except that both their names aro monosyllabic, which, I suppose, suggested the comparizon to the right hon. gentleman. (A, laugh.) Whhat similarity is there between the French marshal who hi 1810 conducted the war accord. ing to the principles of civilized nations and this high commissioner Yeh, who is now the profcs6 of the right hon. gentleman? Did Marshal Ney offer rewards for assassination? (Htear, hear.) Did he issue proclamations recommending the poisoniug of his opponents? We have seen what effect these rewards have had in the case of the unfortunate ship, tl:e Thistle, the crew of which were rnurdered, and have vnitnessed the resutlt of the incentives to poisoning in the attempt made to poison the inhabitants of Hlongkong. .Many hon. gentlemen will regret to learn that a gentleman who was for some time a member of this House, the present Attoniey-General for Hongkong, is suffering from the effects of Commissioner Yeh's ptoclimations, and it is doubtful whether he will recover. Thebrieht hon. gentleman alsoDfavoured the Houso with a Chinessetnecdote, which, as I then suspected and have since discovered, was derived from a French novel. If the right hon. gentleman will allow me, I will read to him a real State paper belonging to there people, who he says are so refined-these Tartars. This is a literal translation of a Chinese edict with which I have been favoured by the kindness of a. friend:-
",To tbose who will verily put the English barbarians to death.-No matter whether literary, or military officers, soldiers, or common poople, whosoever will capture a large English 80-gun ship, a reoard shall bo given in cash to. mnmount of 20,0)0. For the mrurder of a barbarian officer, genuine evidences of the fact being shown, a reward varying, according to rank, from Z Ou v uto W.0. For murder of common men, 51,00.
Nobody cares for the mischievous rat, if he does fall into a disagreeable vessel 1"
After this vill the rigbt hon. gentleman or his right hon. friends get up in this House to excuse the Chinese, and tell us that they aTe a people of refined moti^ns and elegant tastes. A,nlybody who comes to this question with an onbiassed mind will agree-and I am sure people out of doors will agree-tbat it is impossible to discuss it from an Enghsh ora European point of view. Talk of applying the pedantic rules of international law towArds the Chinese ! Why, they neither regard your morals nor look at justice in your light. Their treatment of foreigners is now what it always has been, and what it was in 1847, when six unfor.
tunate Englishmen were murdered as they were coming from church. eo hear nothing of that; and, tbough theirblood cries for reparation, no reparation has been given. Tbe right lion member for Manchester, with the quiet a reasm that lurks in everything he says, talks of referrng this matter to the Emperor of China, as if such a thing could, under any CirCUmstances, be done hy any Government. The right hon. gentleman, following in the track of thc hon. member for the West Riding, sought to detract from the character of British merchantss, and sIso undertook to say that the comm ommunity of this country dissent from the course adopted bythe Government. Is the right ion gentlemn so sore of that ? Is he so sure that when her
turns to those bustings for which he is so eminently qualifled (a laugh) his commercial constituency will accordv witk what he has stated to-night? He has made insinuations which I am surprised that the hon. member for Ashburtan (Mr. Moffatt) could hear and sit in bil seat. (A latU,) Ie insinuates that for thesake of filthy lucre the merc&nta of this country are urging the noble lord to involve as in. a war with China. Does the right lon. gentlemnaxa-appos
that the hon. gentleman, wbo may be regarded as iW head of this great interest, would advocate these hositw because le bas a large stock of tea on hand? The rigtAb or. gentle, mans affected to have a great respect for the eo'ition of ta 13ritishresidentsatCan,ton; but he alt9ptberlpassed. y their judgiment on this question.

If a gross outrage coatli only be justifed by such an absurd story as that, it onLly shows howr hardlly put to it Commnissioner Yeh must have been to invent a ground for its commja'ion. But it having been committed, what was our demand? An apology and an assurnne that such a violation of thetreaty should not be repeated. And it was not uLntil forbearance hd been shown by our commander for some days, and s, refusal on the part of the Chinese to grant anv satisfaction, that measured hostiities were resorted to, firs in the shape of reprisals by the seizur of a junk, and afterwards by in attack on some of their forts. The hon. member for the West Rding is Tery fond of referring ur. to the United §tate,% as a mnodel to be imi tated ini all respects, both in our institutions and our conduct. W%hat, then was the conduct of the Amnerican Conimnodore wvhenan outrae wasofferodaboutthesametlmeto his fia"? An American boat lying along the river, after the dispU4t with us had beguni, was fired into by a fort. She hoisted the American flag, and that was fired upon. That was an insult which undoubtedly required reparation. At the same time, it was not an outrage of the same kind as the deliberate violation of a treaty It might have been caused by aLn accidentaLl mistakeof OYthe persons in the fort, or the use of the American flag xmight 7have been deemed the stratagem of an English boart wishing to tass by in security by pro. tEnding to belong to the Umted IStates. The United Statese commander, however, very properly thought that it required atonemient; and what was the course heour
sued. Some peo~lo are fond of a word and a bolow.:
The United States- commander preferred a blow and a word. (A laugh.) He judged that it was bettor to punish first and ask for explanations afterwards-that it was better in the first place to knock down the ofrending fort, and after
that to demand from Yeh an apology and a gaursantoe
for the futurem His demand, when mnade, was precisely the same as ours, only his attack went first, and the demand followed after it. But was that all? He destroyed the fort-he demandedI reparation from the Chinese; and 24 hours were given them to make their apology. Before that interval had elapsed the Amnerican captain, witha shrewd eye, saw that something was goinig on in the port near which he lay that indicated that at the end of the 24 hours, if the answer was unfavourable, his position might not be so good as it was at the beginnig of that time,andrenewed his hostile operations without waiting for the expiration of the period allowed to the Chinese to deliberate whether they would g ivea explanation and make an apology. The hon. miembr for the West Riding mutst admit, then, that our proceedings evinced extreme forbearance compared with the proceedings of those whom he would have us to copy. (Hear, hear.) Well, Sir, we demanded reparation. Was that a matter of little consequence? You may say, what did it signify if a few men were taken out of a small vessel? Vou might have overlooked it andl have said, if i't happens again we will makeo it a serious matter. It was- one or man as of deliberate violation of our treaty rights. We baa by, the treaty of Nanklin a right for all British subjects to enter and reside in, without molestation, certain parts of Canton. We hadl a right by the treaty to a certain quantity of landI to be gvn ihri the city or immediately adjoining the cit, fr te prpoesof commercial business, and it was disintlysttedtht,as the wants of the British communit cold ot e dfined beforehand, so no particular limit shold e pace asto the quantity of land to be devoted to thei use. Th fufilment of that stipulation has been detrmiatly efuedto us. We have had a small area of groud aloted n ichall foreign merchants are confined, and, asI know from officia negotiation, our applications to the Chinese autbhorities for the warehouse room accorded us by the treaty have never been attended to, and now the greter portionx of our merchandise in Canton is deposited in Chinese warehouses, instead of being under the custody of the British merehants. (Hear.) Thzere was a systematic determination on the part of the Canton authorities to refuse to us all our treaty rights as far as it was possible to deny themn. Well, what were the grounds of that refusal!? It was that the people of Canton were so barbarous so unxruly, so savage, so hostile to foreigners, that it would not be safe for British or any foreign subjects9 to attempt to enter the city. But the lion, member for the West Riding gave us a complete refutation of ta excuse of Yehi and his pro. decessrs. He road us a statement showing that Bditish officers and suxbjects3 hadl walked through the suburbs of Canton and had bee treatedl with the utmost civility and 'kindness-that there was curiosity to ascertain the quality of the clothes worn by the foreign visitors, but there was not the slightest indication of insult or molestation during the course of a long promenade. Well, Sir, does the wall of Canton marksa division between bakrbarism and civilization ? between brutality end good humour?7 Then, as to the Chinese populations in the other towns, of Canton was the only city with which we had commercial relations, we might credit Yeh's assertion-we might believe he knew his own countrymen better than we did. But Shanghai is fxuly as import-ant to us as Canton-it is growing every day in Importance, and there we find no dlifriculty in procuring admissionx for British subjects into soial intercourse with the population. There everyhing is onL the footing of tho most complete humanty and good humour, and when the last accounts left Shanghai, notwithstanding affairs at Canton, there had not bieen tho least intorruption of the friendly relations between the foreigners andi the native population, nor had their been at ony other port. (Hlear, hear.) I say, thien, it is a falsehood, afIlagitious Chinese falsehood, of which Yeh and his pro. decessors have been gulUty in order to excuse the flagrat violation of the treaty. I say that this violation o u treaty rights in the ease of the lorcha was not the first or only one that has occurrd, but was a part of a deliberate system to strip us stop by step of our treaty rights (hear, hear),Xt set the population of the city against us for purposes of thr own, and to give an undue advantage to others against 1British subjects. The most important right was violated-a right of the utmost imgortance to us. How could any commerce between Gate an Hongkong be carried on in British vessels under British license if these vessels are to be liable to all the caprices ofCines polic or Chinese authorities, and to have thei whl crews care off At the moment of sailing This loreha did not happen to have any cargo on beard; hut it might have happened that she had a valuable' cargo, and thus she would have been stripped of all hands and left exposedl to All the risks of damage from want of a proper crevw, to say nothing of the ls which All merchants know to aLrise from the detenttion of a vessel which is ready to sail. (Hear.) Then I say the right which was violated was mort important to the whole British commerce between Hongkonz and Canton-a commerce which is continually growing, and which is carried on almost entirely by veosel
of this description. It is said this vessel had been a pirate, but at the particular time she was certainly engaged in lawful commerce, and had there been any doubt about her character application ought to have been made to the consul, instead of rushing on board to seize an oldl man who was not Lacsosd of beng conoernod in any crime, but was a relation of a mnan whto was suspectedl. Was the Chinese governor of Canton a man of that mildness of cha-- racter, of that justice and forbearance, that we miht oxpoect a friendly remonstrance would satisfy him? Why all the equivocations of Yeh in replying to our communications show that in his mind there was a reservation that he would comamit the same offence when the opportunity again occurred. (IHear, hear.) His aniswer was, no Chinese vessel in future shall take men out of ainy British lorchL without a reaLson. Well, who is to judge of thaLt reason? (Hear, hear.) Why, the Chines themaselves. (Hear, hear.) The very object of the treaty was to prevnst the Chines
from setting up their owrn reasns for interfering with the
just rights aLnd privilees of British vessls. Again, he says
it was a Chinese vesse, and we sought to arrest a Chinese criminal ; but that is entirely setting aside the right which we by treaty have acquired for our consul to Intervene, and is an arrogation to the Chines authorities of privileges which by the treaty do not belong to them. I do not think, throughu the course of this doehato, however extreme may havegbeenttheoionofhn gentlemen, that any one has ventured to defen thisbinhmn ostr
(Hear, hear.) I do not think any one has asserte that thesexnen were legally seized because they were Chinese subjects. The hon. member for the West Riding has asked what would haDppn if a British vessel went into a Spanish port and Spaniish criminals were taken out of that ship. He also asks, do you net in your owa ports subject foreigners to your municipal laws and local regulations! Undoubtedly, Sir, we do. (Hear, hear.) But those who thux. argue have omitted the circumstance of a treaty which overrideg all international ob4xgtions. (Hear, haear.) It is well known that in all our treaties with nationis Iss civiio ha hs in Europe engagements of this sort amnecodrithy entered into. In Turk-ey, for instance, British subjects are not to he taken without the permisson of the British consul; in Persia the same; and in China the stipulation is still more necesar. Why, if the Canton authorities bad really
bee the ild, the gentle, the humane, the forbearing pepl which they have been so assiduously repro-
estdtobe one mnight have trusted to themn, and have said, "We believe in future you will have recourse to the British consul or other British authorities." But look at the atrocious systemt which has prveviled in Canton. We have been told that in the course of a few months 7O,OO9heads.--hinese heads-have been struckoffrby the axe of the executione-r of the barbarous Yeh. (Hear.) 'What nmust we think of the barbarity of a Government under which such executions can take place? I was told not long ago, and I believed it to be a joke until it was confirmed byr more than one gentleman upersonally acquainte
with Chinese affairs, that a mrnan doomed to death migkht get a AubtittAe for b out 20-t ereen Im at th uceo
executnon. (ugbter.) Teysaytoaman, "Yourli(eisvery precanous, you have no oertainty that you may not bo beheaded in a few months by tha caprice of some official without getting anything for It. H ow much better, therofore, is it that you should take what wil enable you to maintain yourself in lunxy for a fortnight, and to loave something behind for your family." What a picture does thabt give of the .ateoof. society among these much bep raised andbe-lauded people 1 (Hear, hear.) These barbrities are committed by the ruling authoritieg, and it is by them that are stimulated all those cruelties to Europeans of which we have recoently read. The first act of Yeh upon the breaking out of the disputo was to issue a reward for thg heads of Englishmen, and he next put out a proclamation declaring that he had taken socret meJns of extirpating that hated race. Wbhavoseonbythelatestaccounts from Hongkonghowthese ecret methods are earried into effect-by tle atrocious murder of 11 Europuans in the Thistle and by the poisoning of the food of the Europeans. (Hear, hear.) I am utterly astonished that the right hon. gentleman the member for the University of Oxford, instead of displaying tx.t generous zeal and those honourable sentiments which he has So muich at Command on subjects much less deserving of the, should havo repeated, though not in tho same words yet inthe same spirit, the justification which ho put forth in the discussion on Chinese affairs some 15 years ago. It w&as alleged then that the Chinese hadpoisoned their wolls -"of course they poisoned their wells'c"; thoright bon entleman., Now, the right hon. seteaid the righ

He says it is tht natural and necesary recourse of the weak against,flio xtrng and if, therefoe a liation should be too weak to resist itnemies in open fight, that, according to the right lion, gentlemanes view, is a sufficient justification for the perpetrgtion of the

stimlate among its popl feelings of hatredt ail antipathy which wonld ave endangered the lives and property of our residents. (Hlear, hoar.) t1m. gentlemen toll us that we pught to h-ave beguxn b7 re-
prisals. So we didl. The admiraL commenced by aeiztng aL
Jlunk. The result was that Yeh said, " We are perfectly easy abouLt that ; yen think you. have got an Imperial jtLnk. but itis only amerchantman-much goodamay itdiOL
Was the admiral to remain content with that? Obviously not. (Rear.) It beeame necessry to bave recourse to fdrthtr measuares. But thenxit is said,"It is trueothat yot woat st ip by step, you destroyed fort atfter fort, allowing between exch an Interval for reflectionL; buxt when yen hadadone that yo-s ha got all the reparation necessary, and you ought to havva dlacontinuodyour operations." (Hear.) Suppose we had d me so, in what condition woulId ouLr affairs at C anton have beenL? We should have destroyed a few forts and spiked a fe w guns, but Yeh would have xaid, "1These barbarians dlemanded from me an apology for what has been done and an assurace for the future that such thng should not occur again. I have given neither the apology nor the assurance for the fututtre. Let the fort go ; it was erected by the inhabitanta of Canton; they shall Pay for its reconstrution. I have gained a, political 'victory over these barbarians. I am satisfied, and if they Are, so much the worse for them." (Rear.) It was said that all these maeasues were attended with great slaughter. But have hoa. gentlemen read the account given by a naLval officer of thi capture of the strongest of these forts? There was buLt a feeble resistance, which caused somne little losste our men, but when they got into the fort they found that the Mlandarins had Nrovi ad beats for their own escape, and the garrison, when deserted by their commanders, ruLshed into the water to escape after them. Did our people laave themi to drown or fire on them in the water? No, they rescued them from the risk of drowning, and sent them to their own friends in their boats. (Hear.) Was that a. measure of cruelty-was that a measuire in which there was no principle masnifested of humanity and forbearance ? The mneasures of coercion were adoptedl by AdmirAl Seymour in concert, no doubt with Sir 3. Bowring, hut it is sufficient to re2d these papers' to see thaat, Sir J. Bowring being at Hongkong and Admiral Seymour at Canton, the detailed exoecution of them rested principally writh the admiral, and if theo admira had said, "I dislike ning any further; we have done enoug'h; we ought to if sa"tisid," of course sir 3. Bowring woeuld have -owe to his decision, as he had no power to compel htm to act. These papers show, I think, that, instead of arrogance, insult, and presumption b3ing onx the side of our people, and maoderation and praiseworthy concession on the side of the Chinese, the maoderation and geatlemanlike feeling was all on our side, and that the proceedings of the Chinese were marked with evasion, equivocation, and false statement. (e aLr, hear.) When our admiral found that the Chinese Commissioner was determined to push matters to extremities, andt would not make either reparation or apology, he assented to the suggestion of the plenipotentiary, and said he must now insist upon the concession of personal official oommunication with the Commis-sioner. That is the natural course of all1 operations. If demands which are in themselves moderate are refused in the first instanco, and no accommodation is arrived at, further arid increased demands arepu forward as hostilities go on. Well, then, it ispsaid the demands were en~tirely at variance with the letters which I wrote and with the iustrun. tions which my succeasors at thie Foreign-office gave to the superintendents and plenipotentiaries at Hongkong. I1 confess I am astonished that maen of clear intellects, havinig a regard to truth, and who profess a desire to act judicially in this matter, shouald confound thig soetirely distinct. (EHear, hear.) The demand wich. I osaild ought not to be presse to hostilities was a demand for the fLul enjoyraent of conditions and privileges according to treaty (hear, hear) -a demand for the general and unesrane simon of all British subjects int) the city of Canton to live there, to have their houses of business there, anda there to co`mmunicate generally with thet Chinese people. 'Was that the demand which was maade by Sir NT. Seymour? Quite the contrary. EHis demaLnd was: onec of a much more limited character. It was simply and first of all for personalcommunication between the commissioner and himself, and no doubt by implication for eventually a more permanent and official acces for British subjects to the city of Canton. Is that a demand which was unreasonable or inexpedient to make, or which it would nust he advantageous to obtain? (Hear, hear.) Even onL the arguments used b7 the hon. mnember for the West Rsdin I call on him to support mne in saying that tha nwul,b a valuable concession-valuable not only for the purpose of our promoting our own interest, but for the purpose of avoiding causes ol future disturbance and collision, (Cheers.) Therefore I say they were right inp ress ing the demands which had been'previously made. No0 Pr, it is said we are at war with China. I contend that we are not at war with China. Up to the last.accouutit
theo quarrel was purely local (hear, hoar), and arising simply from the barbarous character of a man unfortunately placed ini high atuthority at Canton. (Hear, hear.) The last accounts we had from the other poarts showed no probability of any disturbance in the friendly relations - of the
owl o h two countries. WVe are ask-ed whiat our ru= po1cy is to be with regard to China. That, of cors, w Il depend very much on the turn which ouxr present relations with the Chinesemmy take. Our first duty must be to care for the protection of thoseBritish subjects there who have gone out on the faith of treaties (cheers), who have accumulated aL large amount of property ; and also to care for the interests of those enterpIring merchants in this country who ha.ve exeniv ropet stuae locally in Chinta, and liable to a the accidnt which aL state of hostilities ma tend to produce. (Hear, hear.) I say our ardent wish i that thes disputes should speedily, and satisfactorily terminate. It is pretended that danger may arise from an attempt to extend our comnmercial intercourao with China. BuLt I would ask, are the Braziis in any danger because British subjoects have free intercourse writh the Brazilians, or the free States of America because ouar industrious countrymen are carrying, on an extensive commerce withi them? I contend, there ore, that those who say that the Chinese have any right to keep us out for fear of the inroxas And encroachments which we might makea upon them are persons who are misapplying the facts and circumstances of th anies t would be, on the contrary, to the great and taietadvantage of the people of China if i larger commercial intercouxrse were established with them. And if these unfortunsto events had not happened we sheuld have been in communication with the Goverament of Prance-and I think the Unite#itates would join us-with the view of sending A friendly diplomatic misson to Pekia for the purpose of making fresh arrangements with tho Chinese for securing more extended commercial relations with them, or for placing our existing relations on a smore satisfactory footing. (Chieers) What may, now be done in that direction mnust depend on the courase
which present events may take. But wrhen first the Parts
of China were opened ini consequence of the trety of Nankin the expectations of British manufacturers and merchants may be said to have been unbounded at the prospect
afupi trade with so large a population as a third oftowoehuman race.'We have been greatly disa nt:nd.Wbyr? Because~,bytheointernalregulations of
CM ad bytheobstacles they have always opponod toBritish commerce in general, I believe the suLpply of BritiBh maanufactures has been limiited to a narrow strip of land not extending very widely from the coast. Our maanufactures have not expanded under the treatiea ina any quantities, and if, acting in conjunction with France and the United Stats, there were a good revision of thos treaties,by which a larger across to the p epic of Chinawere a~red to Europeans, I am sure there would be an immense augmentation of European cornmrem with China (hear, hear)-aci extension whichi would. be equally advantageous beth to the European producer and the Chinese consumer. (Rear, hear.) The very limited extent of our dealings writh the Chinese hitherto has tended to stimulate theo trade in opuiun -a fact to which the right hon. gentleman the member for South W-ilts (Mlr. S. Herbert) so dexterously alluded last night for the purpDos of catchin soeineStray votes. (A. laugh.) At present the nature of our commerce with the Chinese is such that we can only pay. for our
geods in opium and in silver. The small qusntity of Englsh manufactures is not equivalent to the Chinese produce. From 1842 to the present time ourimports in. the article of tea alone have risen from 42.000,00 lb. to 80,000,00 odd lb.; tho increase in the imports in silk have been still larger, and we cannot have the slightest d ubt if by zamicble relations vith China the Governments of England, France, and the United Stateg were to succeed in obtaining a rg er opening for their comnmerce, that the benefits to those three countries would be immense, and that the advantages to the Chinese themsevcs would bc almost incalculable. (Chers.) Well, then. the question is what are vo to do in this state of things. The hon. gntlenman the member for the West Riding not choosing to allow things to dovelope themselves, rushes to a conclusion and calls on the House to affirm a resolution which I defy the in enuity of man to determinio whether it is a centure on the BrtlsM officers in China or on the members of Her Majest's Government (Hear, hear.) The right hon. gentleman the member for Buckinghamshire stated distinctly the other night that he considered it a oensure on Her Majesty's Government. Much of the argument used in the debate points to that conclusion. (Hear, hear.) We are told that the conduct of out officiAls in China has been cruel and imprudent, and therefore that we ought at once to have censured them, and not having done that, but baving, on tbh contrary, supportod them, and approved their conduct, beliving, as we did, that they did their best to tho utmost of their ability, the resPonsibility, as tbe right hon. entleman the memnber for the Univenity of Oxford ays, f als, of couse, upon us, and thereforo it is to ns that the vote of this evening appliCs. There ,re some things that Iown have atruel me very Vinfliy in the course of this debate. Nothing can be more respectable or ONs? more excite the sympathies of men than appeals to hidh considerations when they a re ado on ad toou -ron;
3 annot say the same of the prodles of am Ch stamend )fr.Burkewvhich wehaveheardduringth7iedbatoe (Cheers.) Wben an appel Is riadoto the great prineiples of truth, of
hear "' It was perfectly plain that Commissioner Yeh did inot know that the lrcha was not entitled to Britisl IrotectiOlt. (Renewed derisive cboers.) He undertkd those sneers; but did hon. gentlemen say that no argument was to be founded on that circumstance ? It WaD not the sactual thing done which constituted tbe offence so much as the modo and manner in which it wras done-not the mere taking away of the men from the lorcha, as the open and cstentatious manner in which they were taken, coupled with the refusal to return them in the same open and public manner. But this lorcha was not the cause of the hostilities which had taken place. (Cheers and counter cheers.) There was nodoubt tbatit wasbuttbe occasion of thebreaking out of &storm which had been collocting sinoe the year 1812. From that time up to thi present moment a determined hostility has been manifested by the Chinese Government-not by the people-towards the British. [Mt. Cobden.-Mention cases.] He had promised not to quote from the blue-books, and he would not break his promise; bu' he arpealed to those who had read the papers whether they did not bear out his assertion that it bad been the policy of the Chinesa authorities to stir up the fanaticism of the people agoanst the British. (Hear, hear.) The testimony of all the English residents, and of all those who had at any time lhad dealings at Canton, were to this effect and these Persons unanimously approvod all that had been done by our officials in this affair, although a state of war was the worst thing which could happen for the interests of their tr-ade. The hon. member for the West Riding had argued this matter on much too narrow a basis, but the people looked at it on broader grounds, and they were, by an overwhelming majority, against the motion. If the hon. member were right in making this motion he could not be right in the terms of it. If he thought there wero other grounds beyond those set forth in the papers to justify our proceedings in China then the course which he hd htken was mostdisingenuous; butif that were not his opinion then the terms of this motion were miserably inadeqnate to the occasion. For a vote of censure nothing could be weaker than thismotion. The hon. member was himself opposed to war and ought therefora to be put out of the consideration of this question just as much as a man who was known to be opposed to the punishment of death ought to be excluded from the jury on a trial of murder.
Mr. COBDEN.-The hon. member is maklng assertions as to my views which are totally unfounded in truth. I beieve I hold precisely the same opinions as the hon. and learned gentleman himself professes to hold with regard to theEe questions.
Mr. CHAMBERS was glad to be contradicted on this point by the hon. gentleman, but it did not diminish his objection to the terms of the motion. This motion was sapported by an extraordinar union of parties, and Sir J. Bowring had been censured is the strongest terms by men who were responsible for his appointment. (Hear, hear.) He did not think the motion was broad enough or hard enough to hammer a new coalition together upon (a laugh), but there seemed a disposition to employ it for that purpose. (" Hear," and a laugh.) In his opinion, the discussion of this subject ought to be approached in a judicial spirit, but he thought that in many quarters very strong prejudice had been manifested. He would givehis vote against the motion, believing that Sir J. Bowring had, under very painful and difficult circumstanoesI cted in a rmanner which became the representative of this country.
Mr. ROEBUCK.-At this period of the debate and at this time of the night I assure the House that I am neither going to trouble them with a long speech nor with any remarks upon the legal aspect of the case. We have been told that we onght to approach this subject in a judicial Ettte of mind. (" Hear," and a laugh.) we have just had, Sir, a specimen of the judicial spirit in which it is discussed by a judge himself. (Laughter and chee) It appears to me that this motion is realy one of censure, and in that light I at once accept it. I mean by my vote boldly to express that censure (cheers), and not simply to censure the persons who have been acting at Canton, but the noble lord and his colleagues who sit upon the Ministerial bench. (Renewed cheers.) I will tell the House why I do so. The blue-books that have been laid upon the table detail the acts committed at Canton. We have been told in this House that the responsibility of all those acts is ac. cepted by Her Majesty's Government, and that they mean to defend them. I say ,then, that we are now called upon to pass over the subordinates in the case, and to fix the responsibility where it ought to rest-namely, upon the shoulders of the Administration. (Cheers.) It has been said that there is a wonderful coalition, and those who take the course I intend to pursue are accused of party motives. I thought, Sir, that my conduct through life would have freed me from the imputation of supporting any party. (Loud laughter, and cheers.) I have, unfortunately as I thought, been compelled to oppose all parties (laughter), and I never formed a coalition with anybody. (Renewed laughter.) On this occasion, therefore, I hope I may be considered to act according to my wont, and that it will be believed Iam now coming forward to blame thenoble lord (Palmerston)andhis colleagues because I think them deserving of censure. (Cheers.)lt istome amatterofutterinsignificance whetherthe noble lord sits on the opposite benches or on those which he and his supporters now occupy. (" Hear, hear," and laughter.) I have only to inquire whether the acts of theGovern. ment redound to the honour of England, and upon that issue I am determined to vote. (Loud cheers.) Now, Sir, Eng. land holds a very peculiar position among the nations. In Europe We are the only great people who have what is called constitutional Government, and every act of ours that is condemned bv mankind is brought forward s an evidence against liberal institutions. (Hear, hear.) Thus are we judged in Europe, but in Asia the case is different. We are the only great people in the western world who possess large Eastern dominions. All our acts in those dominions are judged by a standard, and if they are found fault with it is said, "This is signficant of western civilization and of Christianity.' (kiear, hear.) Our acts in Euro.po are cited against libera institutions, and our acts is the East against western civilization and Christianity. (Hear, hear.) I say, then, that it behoves us as Englshmen seriously to consider what we do. We are acting not merely before one part of the world, but before the whole world. There is this additional circumstance to be considered :-If we were under a despotism it might be said, " Theneople are not to blame; the fault is with their governors ; bhut the liberal institutions of England enable us to blame our governors, and therefore if we do not blame them we take upon ourselves the responsibility of their acts. (Hear, hear.) In such a case the dishonour-if there be dishonour-of their acts reverts from the noble lord and his colleagues upon the people of England, and it is in their name that I raise my voice against the transactions in China. (Cheers.) I wll not treat this question upon the narrow ground on which it has been placed. I listened to the observations of the AttorneyGeneral, and it struck me that he did indeed speak as a lawyer. ("Hear, hear," and a laugh.) He spoke as if he had a retaining fee and a brief. He holds a hrief for the defendants in a "- running down" case. (Loud laughter and eeers.) Thatisnotthewayin whichthis question ought tobe treated. (Renewed cheers.) It ought to be treated upon the great principles of humanity, and susposing everything urged in support of these trans ctions to&be true -supposing the law to be as it has been stated-I ask, are the people of England prepared to take upon themselves the responsibility of these actsof revenge?(Loudchees.)The issue is a simple one. I at once acknowledge that the police force at Canton were wrong in boarding a vessel bearing the English flag; but it should be borne in mind that if they were wrong great luminaries of the law in this country were wrong also (hear, hear); and will you punish the unfortunate people of Canton for an action which has been considered right by somse of the greatest lawyers in England? (Cheers.) I wish hon. gentlemen would suppose that these transactions took place in the city of Liverpool and the Mersey, for I have found that European and western people generaily have one rule of morality for the west and another forthe east. (Hear, hear.) Indeed, that principle has been put boldly forward in this House, but in my opinion the rule of morality extends over the globe (cheers), and what is just and unjust in the Mersey is equally just or nnjust in the river before Canton. (Renewed chees.) The Attorney-General has acknowledged that by the law of civilized nations, if a merchant vesseI appear in 'the watss of a foreign country, and it is supposed that a crime has taken place on board that vessel, the police of the State in whose waters she may be have a right, previous to any treaty, to board such vesselandto make inquiries. But the AttorneyCeneral said, "The Chinese h ve divested themselves of that right by a treaty with us, and therefore they cannot board ships upon which the British flagis flying. Suppose the scene of action to bo Liverpool, and not Can. ton, and the foreign nathon to be France, A vessel is lying off Liverpool manned by Englishmen t0o of whom are known to be pirtes. In the present state of the law the Police of Liverpool could and wrould board that vessel; but we will suppose that the fortune of war bad gone against us, nd that we had entered ixito a treaty with France which prevented the police from hoarding a Frerch vesseL The police, eeing the flag of France flying, would say, "The mere hoistig of te flag does not give a character to the vessel. We believe she has no right to hoist the flag." They board te vessel
they ask for the captain ; he is not there. Who
are tle creew All Englishmen. The pole ak, "Where are your papers?P The reply is, "We bave none." Isay the police would be justified in
boarding that vessel. (Cheers.) That is a clear and simple statement, and I should like to hear it answered. But in a rase as to which lawyers differ-in which you have Lynd. burt on one side and Wenaleydsle on the other-you bring to bear upoii a nillion and a-half of peoole cooped up in a smnall tows the whole power of the civilized English nation' (Cheers.) Now, let me say a word or two about the maligned Chinese. They have been called barbarians,
but it must not be forgotten that they call us barbarians. (A laugh.) They are civilized, but their civilization is of a peculiar kind. (Laughter and cheers.) I understand 'he shallow minds who laugh at that. (Hear. hear.) It is a peculiar civilization, and Lt is peculiar mn this respect and no other, that they have not applied their intelligence to the aTt of war. (Hear, bear.) Europe has dcne so; and if we were to judge of civilization by a know. ledge of the art of war Russia would stand very high
among civilized nations. (Hear, bear.) I say China i5 a Mivilized nation after a peculiar fashion. It is not ours;
but they are a civilized people; and I would ask any man who doubts it to judge of them by the papers in that bluebook. (Hear, bear.) Compare the truculent manner in which the English papers are written with the papers of ths Chinese. Mark the courtesy and intelligence that distinguish tbh latter, and let any impartial person, if such is to
oe found on the face of the earth say which is the civilized man and which the barbarian. (Cheers.) I
would go still further, and say which is the man that pro-
feses the most humnane and generous doctrines. iier, be&r.) We call ourselves aciviized eople. We profess to
be Chbistians and to be the frienu,s of pow, and we sent out to China the Secretary of the Peace eoadety. The sesult i on have before you. (Cheers and laughter.) I hope that ihsfs is noindication of what we may expect from the
tem.tl. inen who advocate pace inrthe abstract. -(A laugh.) That muan has bcen sent to represent the people of this
!ep rned frIsLd. There can he no queston that be chastised the House of Commons, because he said, "After two aiights' debate, until I the Attomney-General rose it isrldicuIons to suppoge that anything could have been said in this Eouse which was not said in the other House." Bat, now, lcok at the bearing of this upon half the Houze of Lords.
3'Xthe House of Lords argued in favour of a motioa ralogus to that of the hon. member for the West Riding;
tIZte af nldn hsonlglcif h Lord Chancellr, rgud agins it Myhon.andleanedfriend said
f or when the Lord Chancellor and otheshdwihnfit
3.slour, constructed their little bulwarks aud fotfcations :-beut them as they best could, from materials such as the3 atatute law and the colonial ordinance afforded, he swept them nil away into the sea, as we are told in the story of the siege of Troy that Neptune swept away the bulwarks of the Greeks-he made comnp!etely clear deecks, and began upon his own account, stating everything% upon his own single argument, and declaring that all that hadi been -advanced
bor,drawn from the statute law anid the oriace, was either worthless or immaterial. (Cheers.) That is not, so far as I am concerned, either anx unimportait < r unsatisfactory result of the debate to record. (Hear. Lear.) We now start fresh and clear with the hon. and learned gentleman the Attorney-GeneraL We have nothing to do with those I ani almost afraid to namie, hut who wIIl he Well understood; we have nothing to do with thwelir argument; but have only to look to the argument as presented by lthe Attorney-General. ("1 Hears'1 and a laugh.) Well, the Attorney.lleneral declined altogethler to deal ,with any argument or title which we could derive froml imunicipal law Imperial, or colonial law. The hon, and learnedt7gentlesnan said that. the only document to look to is the trcaty; and it is under that treaty, if at all, we must miak-e good our case. Now, I do not know whether I shiall be unduly taxing the patience of the House, if I observ-e, sn passing, how curiously, as occasion serves and interest prompts, nations and Governments can accept in one year, or contrive in one year, arguments which in the month of adverse D~wers they have repellcd the year before. (Hear, heaLr.) lAst year we had ageunestion with America about recruiting. America char~ us with having broken the rules of international law. We declined to admit th-3 appeal to that tribunal, and never would consent to ha tined on any other issue hut whether we had broken the municipal law of America. So we said ineffect,that where a country has dealt by its municipal law with part of the matter of international law, that country is hound by the definitions of its miunicipal law, and is not entitled in the face of aniother country to go beyond those definitions 'ilat was the argnament last year when it servedI its tu;n, Pr.d now we have a different arg,ument. (Hear, he~ar.) We are now in the condition of America, with limitEd conditions establishedl by municipal law. My hon. and learned friend the Attorne7-General, reecing that the Zierehant Shipping Act 2s faital to his argument, now says, exactly reversing the whole doctrine of the controversy wit-h America l9as year, we have nothing to do with the narrow definitions of our municipal law, but we mnust resort to the plain common-sense view of the treaty. (Hear, hear.) But my learned friend 'was curiously inconsistent, not only with the argument of last year, hut with his own argumient on the present occason, for he said the treaty is the only decumnent in the case, and the municip il law~ has riebnoh to do with it, the queston is altogethiar one of international law. And how did he make good his argu. mnent? It turned on the meaning of " British subject -1" and did the hon. and learned gentleman derive his authoril' from the International law ? No; he resorted to a dictum of amunicipal tribunal dealing with a civil question athone, and, after denying that the municipal law could supply materials to assist us in coming to a right view of the case, he fetched out a judgment of that triibunal and presented it as an instrument which was anthori. lat'ively to decide the question. (Hear, hear.) But the last an greatest wonder of all is that this instrument which he made use of was, as has been shown by the hion, and learned member for Tavistock, by the hon. and learned gentleman opposite, and lastlyand mostclearly by the hon. and learned member for Plymouth, uitterly worthless for his purpose, and had nothing whatever to do with the ca-se. (Hear, hear.) What the lon. and learned Attorney-General showed was this, that there was a judgment or, perhaps, judgments of 'British courts, under which the claima of a natural-born English subject, who had become an Amnerican subject, had been domiciled, registered, had planted all the roots of his social life in America, to the rights and privileges of an American subject, under a particular treaty describing himas anAmerican subject, was conceded. What is the use of stating such a case and applying it to the case of the Chinese, who do not claim under the definitions of a I articular treaty, who had never been domiciled in any legal *ense in British dominions, who had never been naturalized at all, who had tak-en no oath of allegiance, who had not ePve n, cording to my learnedl friend's argument, leased a handful of land at Hongkong, but were mere residents there for a short or long time? (Hear, hear.) The whole question, accordinig to the Attorney-General's argument, turns on the construction of the 17th article of the treaty
and what by the term " Britisli subject" is meant at Hongkong ? It incluides every Chinese resident withiin the British alleiance according to the AttorneyGeneral, whether he hd resided there a long time, or only, for a6 auGmrent, when he took out hisu rgse. Ihtwr
really the law, it would be timne to call law to the tribunal ouf common sense and justice; because then, instead of being the guardian of the instituitions of the State and the regulator of the relations between man and man, it would ho a mass of cabalistic art, got up by sophistical minds, not to assist the infirm reason of mankind, hut to prevent that reason, through its infirmity, ever coming to a right conclusion. (Cheers.). Having adverted to the, arguments, founded on the municipal and international law, I now ask how does this question stand on the higher ground of natural justice ? (Cheers.) I say higher ground, because it is the highest ground of all. My righit hon. friend was forbidden to appeal to the principles ~of Christianity. I grant that it is painful to have them brought into discussions of this kind ; but at the same time any man, feeling t'he obligations of the position in which lhe is placed, miulht find it difficult under the circumstances altogether to avoid reference to such a topic. However, as it seenis to give offence, I will mnake no appeal to these principles; but I will appeal to that which is older than Christianity, because it was in the world before Christianity-to that which is broader than Christianity, tecasse it extends in t~e world beyond Christlanity,-and to that which uinderlays Christianity, for Christianity itse'f aPpeals to it,-l appeal to that justice which binds man to alan. (Hear, hear.) I ask the House to take with me a short survey of the position in which we stand inx China. We have spoken of the treaty obligations of China towards ourselves ; hut let not our treaty obligations to China be for. gotteni. For what purpose did we acquire Hongkoiig ? Have y-ou looked to the terms of the treaty on that point ? it is there stated that the Emperor of China cedes Hongkoing, the reason being that it is obviously necessary 4and desirable that British subjects should have some port where they may careen and refit their ships. If you meant to act accordisg to the spirit of the treaty, that 'was the ].Urpse to which the port of Hongkong should have been applioed. I hiave heard the Vice-President of the Board of TI'rade with astonishment on thia,questioa. Ho rose from hiis seat and said that he would introduce tomething not mnentioned before. It certainly had not been mentioned before, wad it has not been mentioned since. (" HTear, hear," and lauighter.) The lion. 'entleman said that the Chinese Population at Hongkong was not to be consider,d a.s ordinary population of Chinese, as it was handed -over to the Queen of England by the Emperor of China. Why, there are 60,000 Chine-se at Hongkong, and at the time Hongkong was conceded I believe the number of Chinese thiere was about fi00. The mnaking Hongkong a port for careening and refitting ships is not your onily treaty obligation to China. There is another. It is the 12th article of the supplementary treaty :-
" A fair and regular tariff of duties and other dues having now been established, it is to ho hoped that the system of amu-glin- which has heretofore been carried onk between Engish ind Chinese maerchants-in maany cases with the open connivance and collusion of the Chinese Customi-house -offeers--will entirely coeas; and the most peremptory proiclamation to all English merchants has been aireadly issued on this suLbject by the British plenipotenitiary, who wil also instruct the different consuls to strictly wateh over and carefullY scrutinize the conduct of all persons being British subjects trading under his superintendence."
B3y that article you have contracted, under the moat solemn obligations, to puit down smuggling'to the very best of youxr Power. (Hear, hear.) Is there anything peculiar in your smugglingon the coast of China? It is the worst, the most pernicients, demoralizing, and destrucotive of all the contra. band trades that are carried on upon the surface of the globe. (Cheers.) It is partly a trade in salt. That, of cGourse, can be open to no objection beyond the fact that it is countraband. But it is also partly a trade in opiumn. Have you struggled to put down that trade? (Cheers.) I ask the nloble visonunt who will addres the Hlouse to-night have the British Covornuient struggled to put down that trade? (Cheei' They maay say that they did struggle to put it down, hut they found that it was too strong for them. Then, I ask whether they have done anything to encourage that trade? (Hear, hear.) Yes, Sir, theyhtave done the very thinig that is now in issue. They have created this fleet of lorchas. (Hear, hear.) 'What has been its purpo-se? What has been its effect? I refer yo)u to the very words of T'our own authority, page 7 of the correspondence, where it its said that the grantingr of the register to thes colnia
paSsage was quoted by tbe Lord-Advocate. Ue is a gentleman of so much intelligence that, as he appeared not to have gathered the sense of it, I infer that he cannot have read tlese papers. It was beneficial to the colony? And why was it beneficial? Because it increased this coasting trade. Did it increase a coasting trade in the goods and manufactures of Great Britain or in the produce of India, such as cotton, opiunim &c. It is quite plam that this coasting trade mainly has reference to smuggling purposes. Thera can be no doubt about it. Unfortanately, the quantity of British goods which you send to China is still extremely small. Your greatest and most valuable trade with Cains is this trade in opium. It is a smuggling trade. You pro. mnised to put it down, Yon received Hongkongfor the parpose of careening and refitting your vessels, and instead of that you have located those 60,000 Chinese within it, and from them you find the means of sustainiDg and organiziny a fLeet,of coasters whose business it is to enlarge, who have enlarg4a. and who are enlarging, that smuggling traffic that you are bqund by treaty to put down. (Cheers.) So stands the case so far as the treaty is conoerned. And, now, having taken Hongkong for purposes that you have not fulfilled, having apphed it to differQet purposes, havin;z failed titrely, or rather not having bondfilje endeavoured toUt down this smuggling trade, which on tho contrary has grown largely amco the treaty, having organized thi
coasting trade for purpores which included an enlargement of that smuggling trade, you accumulate all these ats of injustice by trumping up a claim built upon technicalities to cover this coasting fleet with the British 'ag (hear, hear); and when we are told that such proceedings ought not to be endured then you reproach us with indifference to the honour of the ensign of our country. (Cheers.) Wa, there ever such a,seris of mockericsi Butayohave contessed that the case of the Arrow is satisfied. I wont
cf him for that 2,000,0001. of reduction. (Mach lauhter, in which Lord Palmerston heartily joineL) I have only one more remark to make, and it is aboot the hon. ud learned member for Hertford. I must confes his speech & little surprised me. (Hear, hear.) He took me to task for the character I had given of British merchants enaged in the China trade, and he argued in favour of caling tfioseBritish merchants to give evidence in favour of the Government. Now, if any one happens to recollect, there was a littla while ago ameeting at the Freemasons' Tavern at vhich Lord Sbaftesbury ought to have presided, but being obliged to rig up a jury-mast (a laugh) and improvise a presidenk, they caUed upon the hon. and learned mnember for Hertford to tal-o the chair. What was that mneeting for? Why, every speaker denounced the British merchants in China for carrying on the oplum trade. (EHear, hear.) It was from those speeches, which I carefully read, and from which, as is my wont, I cut out certain passages, that I got so much information with regard to these Chinese merchants. (Cheers and lau4bter.) I can never be angry with the hon. member for Liverpool, who has certainly a feminine way of scolding, but if I had introduced a tithe of the facts which have been forced upon my notice as to the doings of this exceptional body of British merchants, the hon. member, instead of scolding me, would have been obliged to find arguments to defend his friends. The hon. member for Hertford (Mr. T. Chambers) took us to t3ak for not acting in a judicial way. He was the prcsident of a meeting where the speakers excommunicated and outlawed the British merchants, yet he c!lUed upon these outlawed representatives of the British merchants as evidence to the character of the Government. (Cheers and laughter.) I am obliged to the House for having heard me. In all sincerity I wish this motion to be talcen without reference to its consequences, and with the sole desire to do justice to the ments of the case. (Cheers.) I think it Oad that any hon. gentleman should be debarred from givig an honest vote on a question of this importance. I
ill admI.t that Parliamentary government must be carried on by parties. If parties were more advanced and came up to my standard, I might join them ; but as it is I am isolated, and am content to be a pioneer. But there are great occasions upon which all parties ought to give an honest and conscientious vo't. We all of us have mnoments when we look back upon such a vote as this with more satisfaction than any vote given in the mere scramble of parties. (Hear. ) I tell my hon. friends near me (on the Ministerial
nches), many of whom, I fear, are giving their votes with heavy hearts, that I wish they would look at this question free from party bias, and give that vote which will be most for their own peace and happiness of mind. (" Hear," and
li-. KINAIRD was unable to obtain a hearing for Fo m" moments in consequence of loud cries of T' Divide." h'.ence was restored, upon his promise not to detain the House, and he then said he was present at the meeting referred to by the hon. memberfor the West Riding, ad he did not shrink from owning it. The right hon. member for Wiltshire asked him how he could reconcile the vote he was about to give in favour of the Government 'with his objections to the opium traffic, and the right hon. baronet the member for Carlisle went so far as to say he washed his hands of the bloodgniltiness in the slughter at Canton. For the hundreds of lives lost by recent proceedings at Canton hundreds of thousands of lives were lost in consequence ofthe opium trade.
The House then divided, and the numbers Were--
For the motion ... ... ... 263 Against it ... ... ... ... 247
Mlajority against the Government -16
As soon as the clerk at the table handed to Mr. Cobden the paper containing the statement of the numbers, and it was seen that the Government was defeated, there was a loud cheer, which was suspended while the numbers were announced; but after their announcement it was repeated, aad continued for some minutes.
THE WINE DUTIES.
Mr. OLIVEIR had upon the paper a notice of motion for the appointment of a select committee upon the wine duties; but, at the suggestion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, he consented to postpone it for a fortnight.
The Honse adjonrned at 25 minutes after 2 o'clock.

ln the House of Lords last night,
The LORD CHAKCELLoR moved the second reading oftheDivorce and Matrimonial Bill, which, he said, was substantially the same as the measure which was passed by their Lordships last session, anc ;which was based on the reconmmendation of the Commissioners appointed to inquire into the sub. ject, who agreed that a Court should be constituted with the power of granting divorces a vincldo ,at7rimenii n s well as a inensd et t1oro. The Bill of last session proposed the creation oE such a tribunal to be composed of the Lord Chancellor, the tord Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench, the Lord Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, and the lidge' of the Court of Probate; to these high dign&aries the present Bill proposed to ndd the Dean of the Ar¢hes, and, with one or two trifling exceptions, that was the only addition that had been made to the Billof last session. That Bill, after having been referred to a select committee, in which a proviso was iaserted that the adulterer should not be *1loved to marry the adultress, was sent down to the Lower House, and ultimately withdrawn. HIe now reintrosduced the Bill, omaittingr the proviso referred to, and inserting & clause by wh-ich separation deeds were legized bv positive enactmnent, Having. I thus g3vu an Qutiline of the Bill, rnd specified~thQ
;articulars in which it differed from that brought forward last session, he begged to move that it be read a second time.
Lord LYNDHURST was induced to take part in the debate at this stage of the Bill because hethought, from the numerous communications he had received, that a change had come over the public mrid as tothe matter of divorce, chiefly, he believed,
in consequence of the observations which had been. made by the Bishop of OXFORD last year. The right rev. prelate had quoted ST. AucGusTiNe as a great authority, who, he said, had never been able to mnake up his mind as to the propriety of permitting divorces. Now, he had looked into the voluminous writings of ST, AUGUSTINE, and, although he could not but admire his subtlety, he must say he was more skilful in raising difficulties than in finding methods to remove them. Still, there was no doubt that, so far from being unable to make up his mind as to the propriety of divorces, he made statements directly in support of the measure, and repeated them over and over again, to the effect that it was lawful to dismiss a wife for adultery. Remarriage was the point on which he declared that he could not make up his mind; to that alone, and not to the question of divorce in general, he supposed tkhe Bishop of OxFORD referred. So much for ST. AUGusTmNE. There were other persons who objected to the relief afforded by the present measure, and wished to retain the old system, but they seemed to forget that under the present system divorce was limited to a small class, for few were able to bear the expense of the process which was to afford them relief. Passing on to the Bil itself, he wished to add a fifth cause for divorce to the four which it contained; this was, for wilful desertion of a wife by a husband. Finally, he objected to the new clause which ivas to give to voluntary separations the force and power of law. Against such separations the highest judicial authorities had invariably set their faces. They were opposed to the principle of law, and the LORD CHAINCELLon, in introducing this clause. was not maintaining, but altering and violating the law, to the great peril of public policy.
The Bishop of EXETER moved the postponement of the Bill for three months, in order to give the LORD C11ANCELLOR time to amend it. As it now stood, with its centralization and expense, and the remarkable omission that it contained no clause to abolish the disgraceful action for criminal conversation, it was a mockery of legislation.
Lord Sr. LEONARD's declared that the Bill left the law of divorce exactly where it found it. It only proposed to give to a Court the great power at present possessed by Parliament. He should give his assent to the Bill if it ultimately assumed the shape he wished it to take.
The Bishop of OXFORD felt himself bound to vote for the Bishop of ExETEs's amendment. In his opinion the object of aU legislation on these points ought to be to fence marriage with as many safeguards as possible, but this BiU proceeded on a diametrically opposite principle, when it allowed man and wife to dissolve the marriage tie altogether on the occurrence of any slight disagreement.
Lord WENSLEYDALE thought the measure ougbt
not to be postponed, and declared his intention ofI voting for the second reading.
The Earl of DERBY had come down to the House with the intention of voting for the second reading, because he thought its advantages exceeded its disadvantages; but the arg,uments he had heard both for and sgainst the BillUhadbeen such as to convince him that it contained in its present shape many most objectionable features, and, though he should adhere to his intention of voting for the second reading, he should only do so on the understanding that it was to receive the maturest reconsideration m the committee.
The Marquiis of L,1NSDOWNE and Lord REDESDALE lhaving also addressed the House,
The LonD CHANCELLoR replied.
Their Lordships then divided, when the numbers were,-
For the second reading .. 25 Against it ... .. ... .. 10
Majority .. ... ... -15 The Bill was accordingly read a second time.
Some other business was then despatched, after which their Lordships adjourned.
In the House of Commons the adjourned debate on China wae once more resumed.
Mr. BOUNDELL PALMER said, it being by no means difficult to justify a vote in support of the resolution proposed by Mr. COBDEN, that the Chinese had given us no ground of complaint, it was indispensable that the Government should justify the beginning of hostilities by showing that the Chinese had been guilty of a violation of their duty towards Great Britain. It had been admitted that the British flag by itself was wholy irrelevant to the question as to the nationality of the Arrow; it must be showtn that by the treaty she was an English merchant vessel, and if this were not done there was no justification whatever for the hostilities. A British lorcha without a British register was not a British vessel ; for he denied the position of the ATTORNEY-GENERAL, that the vessel was British because the owner was resident at Hongkong. If this were true, by a parity of reasoning, an Englishman residing at Canton or Shanghai might impart a Chinese character to his ship, a doctrine which, as he argued at some length, would lead to absurd consequences. Then, was there any other ground besides ownership? The British character could be impressed upon the vessel only oy the colonial ordinance, and, assuming that ordinance to be legal, the register granted under it had expired, and he maintained that the expiry of the register was absolutely fatal to the case. There could be no mistake; Sir JoHN BOWRING must have understood the matter; he knew and confessed that the protection under the register was gone. Upon the general question, much, he observed, had been said of the crimes of the Chinese, the vexations suffered by Englishmen in China, and the vices of theChinese Government; but the true bearing of these remarks, in his opinion,was not that we should persevere in the course we had taken, but if we dealt with a people who were misgoverned, imperfectly civilized, and easily provoked to outrage and violence, that we should be more careful to exhibit an example of humanity and moderation in our conduct towards them, instead of asserting our power, and, after obtaining reasonable reparation, insisting upon further demands.
Colonel HERBEKr contrasted the sentiments expressed by the Government respecting public servants employed at a distance with the treatment experenced by the late Lord RA&oLA.
Mr. KENDALLexpressedhis conscientiousbelief that if the resolution passed it would cause more bloodshed. He could not forget, he said, who had driven us into the late war, and who had helped us out of It, and if we were now at war he wanted to know vho were most likely to get us out of it. Mr. KmND3ALL diverged into topics somewhat remote from the question, with the view of showing the evil effects which would, in his opinion, follow the displacement of the present First Minister.
Mr. GIBSON defended the agitation of this question upon constitutional grounds. When the papers were laid upon the table the executive Government invited the opinion of the House upon their conduct, and the resolution affirmed that the papers failed to establish satisfactory grounds forthe violent measures resorted to at Canton. tHG noticed the obJections to the resolution, grounded upon the
effect it wouId exert upon the people of Canton and upon the opinion of the European merchants in China, contending that it was not correct to impute to the general mercantile community of England the opinions of those who were connected with the
opium and tea trades of China, and who might, he said, be swayed by their interests. Nothing more onvinced him of the propriety of the resolution than that the great body of the Conservative party
supported it. Applying himself more directly to the question, he asked why no attempt had been made to refer the matter to the Emperor of CHiwA, who might have reprimanded Commissioner YBn ? Instead of this, hostlities were at once commenced, which made it difficult for the Emperor to do us justice. With regard to the nationality of the lorcha, he cited q (didtm of Dr. LuSHfLNGTON, to the effect that it was n 't competent to any State, by its own regulations, at once to change the national character of a vessel to the detriment of other States, which confirmed, he said, the view taken by Lord LYNDERUST of this question, that this country had no right to convert a Chinese ship into a British sbip.
Mr. OSBORNE, premising that the question had been so obfuscated by the arguments of lawyers that It had got into a morass, invited the IRouse to discuss it upon broader grounds. The real question, he said, resolved itself into two poiats
#>t, wpre Mi JoNi Bwowa;o1 r, V.CoyI
PARS, and Sir M. SEYMOUl justified in the course they had adopted after deliberate consideration they being on the spot; secondly, were Hnn M&JESTY's Ministers worthy of censaure for their support and approval of their officers ? After reading a ferocious proclamation insued by the local Government of Canton, ridiculing the proposal of Mr. GirsoN to refer the dispute to the Emperor of CENA, and censuring his reflection, upon the merchants trading with China, he warned the House that the consequence of passing a vote of censure upon the Government in this matter would be the presentation of a bill for damages by the American and other merchants to the amount of 5,000,0001., besides the loss of life. He complained of the attacks upon Sir JoIIN BowRiNG, who, he said, had been hunted down, called a liar, a blunderer, and everything but a thief. But it was not Sir JoHN BoWRvING at Hongkong who was struck at, but the Minister in Downing-street; the real object was to displace Lord PAkNXERSTON, to throw overboard the man who bad brought us through the war, who never forsook a friend, and had no enemybut those of his coumtry.
Mr. HENLEY remarked upon the desultory character of MIr. OsBosoa's speech, which he proposed to avoid. The House, he said, were caUed upon to say whether the papers did or did not fail to establish satisfactory grounds for the violent measures resorted to at Canton. On the other hand, the Government had approved the judgment, firmness, and moderation of the British officials, and their respect for the lives and property of the Chinese. If there was any reasonable doubt, he admitted that they should have the benefit of it; but he protested agamst any inference in their favour being drawn from the character of the Chinese, which was foreign to the question. In the matter of the lorcha, be the Chinese right or wrong, was not the seizure of the forts a sufficientreprisaL and reparation ? He thought it was. But, after this, the case was complicated by another demand, the right of entry, under the treaty, into Canton; and there was not anything in the papers which led him to the conclusion that it was either a justifiable demand or wise policy to endeavour to obtain its concession in the mode that was adopted. Much had been said of the effects which this resolution might have on the other side of the water; but he must not be asked, he observed, to approve acts which no circumstances in human life could justify-downright, wilful, and deliberate untruth, and the bringing the horrors of war, without proved necessityand without warning, upon non-combatants.
Mr. E. EGEBToN said he should not enter into the legal merits of the question. Whether the Arrow was a British vessel or not; whether Sir JOHN BOWRING had exercised a proper amount of moderation and discretion; whether the reparation was sufficient,-were matters he forbore to inquire into. Ele asked his mind what would be the practical effect of the resolution. He had heard from experienced persons that its effects would be dangerous in the extreme, and he believed that Sir G. GBRy had not exaggerated when he said that British property and British life would be unsafe. These considerations induced him to give his vote against the motion and in favour of the Government.
Mr. J. PniLIMoRZ expressed his solemn and deliberate conviction that in point of law the Chinese were completely in the right, and that the pretence for calling the lorcha a British ship was a manifest absurdity. It was apparent to him, from the perusal of the papers, that these grave disasters resulted from a sense of offended dignity in Sir JoHN BowvRiNG, who had succeeded in getting what he termed " a substantial grievance."
Mr. COcHRAxE, in supporting the motion, described the condition of the city of Canton, which, he insisted, in opposition to Mr. OsBonNE, had been bombarded.
Mr. T. CAxrBms opposed the motion. Ee agreed that the House was called upon to do a judicial act; that the resolution was a vote of censure and condemnation upon the Government at home, who had not done the thing complained of, andupon our representatives in China. If so, the House should place itself in the situation of Sir JoEIN BowRis'c at the time; it should consider the character of the Chinese and the history of our con:nexion with their country; but the whole tenour of the speeches in support of the motion was intentionally to ignore all these essential points. He had arrived at the conclusion that, in point of law, we were right in the matter of the Arrow. But it was almost immaterial whether we were right or not; it was perfectly plain that Commissioner YEE did not know that the vesselwasnot under Britishprotection. Here was a public offence ostentatiously given in the face of a people who would be influenced by the act, and we asked not merely a reparation to the extent of the exact thina done, butwhich touched the moral and political wron`g; and this was refused. The resolution was guardedly worded, but the people of England judged this question upon broader grounds.
Mr. RoEBUCK recognized this as a vote of censure, not simply upon the officials at Canton, but upon Lord PALMaEsToNandhis colleagues. Why? Because they had approved all the acts of those officials; they had assumed the responsibility, and the House ought to fix that responsibility upon them. The ATORNByGENERAI,he said, had argued, as if he had a retaining fee, a question which ought to be argued upon the principesof morality and humanity; and, supposing the law to be as he had put it, were the people of England, he asked, prepared to take upon themselves the responsibility of the proceedings at Canton? if the Chinese were wrong, they erred in common with great luminaries of the law in this country, and why should they be punished, their houses shattered and their relatives butchered ? But we had alleged another plea,-the Chinese, it was said, had broken the treaty. He wanted to know if there had been no breach of the treaty on our part. Their refusal to let us enter the city should be dealt with tenderly. -
MIr. GLADSTONE vindicated himself and Sir J. GRAHA31 from being supposed to be parties to the appointment of Sir JOHN BowvRiz?; but he protested against the making Sir JOHN a stalking-horse to divert the attention of the House from the real matter at issue, which involved the interests of humanity and the honour of England. He adverted with warmth and severity to the remarks made by Sir G. GREY upon Sir J. GRAHAu in relation to that appointment, and to some imputations cast upon him by MIr. BEINTINCK and Mr. KENDALL, and, approaching the subject under discussion, he cleared it of matters which, he considered, had been substantially abandoned or disproved. One of these matters was that expressed in the cabalistic phrase "Insults by Chi-,' the volume recording which did not support, he asserted, the proposition that we had festering wrongs agaist the Chinese. He reminded the House that no answer had been given to the objection that, if a wrong had been committed by the Chinese in the case of the Arrow, the proper remedy was by reprisals. The ATroRiEY-GENERAL had declined to deal with the question of title founded upon our municipal law; the only document, he had alleged, was the treaty, and under that, if at all, the case against the lorcha must be made out. But he (Mr. GLADSTONE) denied that there was any authority forthatposition, which rested upon the doctrine of the ATToRLNLY-GENERAL, that the term " British subjects," in the treaty, meant any Chinese resident at Hongkong. When we talked of treaty obligations by the Chinese, what were ourtreatyobligations towards them? The purpose for which Rongkong
was given to us was that it should be a port im which British ships might careen and refit. Was not our contraband trade in opium a breach of treaty obligations? Had ourGovernmentstruggled to put it down, as bound by treaty? Had they not encouraged it by organizing a fleet of lorchas under the Britiqh flag? They,he said, who put the British flag to the uses to which it was put in China stained that flag. Mr. GLADnoNE dwelt with much energy upon the calamities which the wat had inflicted upon the Cantonese, a state of things, he observed, which the resolution invited the wisdom of Parliament to put an effectual check upon. For what, he asked, were we at war with the Chinese? The Government had not stated what we were asking from them. Were we afraid of the moral effect upon the Chinese if the acts of the Government were disavowed ? But consider, he said, the moral impression which must now be produced, and never could be avoided. If the House had the courage to assert its prerogative, and adopted this resolution, it would pursue a course consistent at once with sound policy and the principles of eternaljustioe.
Iord PAummsroN said, he should not have expected from Mr. CoBDXX such a motion, or such a speech in its support; nor should he have anticipated the bitternes of his attack upon Sir JonE BowwwG, an ancient fjend, a man who had raiged himself by hia Ulento, cittnmmontsb aud plibJi .eryiC. and
whom he (Lord PALUE5isrow) thought a fit person for the sitlation he held. If there was any man less likely than another to get the country into hostilities, it was Sir Jom BOwiu2G, who had been a member of the Peace Society. But what most surprised hin in Mr. COBDPIKS speech was the anti-Eoglish spirit that pervaded it, and an abnegation of the ties which bound men to their country and countrymen, which he hardly expected. With regard to the event which had given rise to this discussion, he should not go into the legal argument as to whether the vessel was English or not; this fact did not lie at the bottom of the question. Wfe had a treaty with the Chinese stipulating that British vessels should not be boarded without a previous application to the British Consul, and the question was, what did the Chinese know or believe as to the nationality of the Arrow t Did they consider her a British vessel? He said theydid, andif they knowingly violated the treaty, it was imnnaterial whether, according to the technicalities of the law, the register had expired. It was the animits of the instult, -the wilful violation of the treaty,-that entitled us to demand reparation for the wrong and an assurance of future security. He, however, thought, for reasons which he stated at some length, that the vemsel was entitled to the protection of the British flag, and that the objections to the register were mere quibbles. He insisted that, after the refusal of reparation,-only one of many violations of treaty rights by the Chinese,-hostilities were amply justified, arid that our proceedings were marked by extreme forbearance compared with the proceedings of the Americans when their flag was insulted. The outrage committed upon the lorcha was, therefore, only part of a deliberate system on the part of the Chinese officials to wrest from us a right essential to our commerce in those waters. The barbarity of the local authorities at Canton, the beheading of 70,000 men in less than a year by the Commissioner, and the deformities of Chinese society, were strongly urged by Lord PAL,m-RsTOw, who complained that there had been in the debate a disposition to excuse or palliate these enormities. It had been said that reprisals should have been first resorted to, and so they were, he said, but without effect. The execution of the ulterior operations rested with Admiral SmnnouB, who, if of opinion that they were excessive, would not have permitted them. We were not at war with China; by the lat accounts the quarrel was still only local. To the question what the future policy of the Government would be, he replied that this must depend in a great measure upon the course of events; their first duty would be to protect British subjects in China. But forthese events diplomatic intercourse m-ight have been opened with Pekin, and an extension of commerce been the result, advantageous equally to China and to Europe. What, he asked was the Government expected to do? To send out a message to Commissioner YE} that he was right, and that he might repeat his outrage upon other British vessels? This would be withdrawing from the British community protection against a merciless barbariain; it would disgrace this country in the eyes of the civilized world, and especially in the estimation of Eastern nations. He concluded, after some pointed strictures upon the combination of parties confederated together upon this question against the Government, by reminding the. House that; it had in its keeping, not only the interests, the property, and the lives of many of our fellow countrymen, but the honour, the reputation, and the character of the country.
Mr. DIsRAELi accepted the construction put upon the motion, that it was a vote of censure upon the Government, not upon the officials in China, and he thought Sir JoHN BoWRINa had been unfairly treatsd in the debate; if his conduct had been ratifled by the Government it should not be impugned by the House. The question, he said, was not one of law, but of policy, the policy of the Government, which was by force, not by diplomatic action, to increase our commercial relations with the East; and the House was called upon to express its opinion upon this dangerous policy. He commented, in a strain of sarcasm upon the alarm at a sipposed combination manifested by Lord PALNuEnSTON, who, he said, was the very archetype of political combination without principle. Let the noble Lord, he continued, who complained that he was the victim of a conspiracy, not only complain to the country, but let him appeal to it.
di. COBDE,x having made a lively reply the House livided, when the numbers were-
For the motion ... ... ... 263 Against it ... ... ... ... 247
Majority against the Government -10
After some further business the House adjourned at 25 minutes past 2 o'clock.
HER MAJESTY'S Ministers have to thank the
HER MjsAJTY's Ministers have to thank the Opposition side, and all the other sides of the lHouse, for many reasonable and timely suggestians as to what they ought to have done, and what the British authorities at Hongkong ought to have done, under the recent emergencies. These suggestions have been offered with that simplicity, that considerate regard for comfort and honour, and, above all, that good sense which uniformly distinguishes the advice of those who prefer " your
' room to your company." The most frequent suggestion throughout the debate has been that as soon as Consul PAxziEs had reported to Sir Jonq BoWRING and Admiral SE,touR the seizure of the crew of the Arrow, and their imminent fate at the hands of the executioner, these gentlemen, after thanking their stars that they had not been on board the lorcha at the time, ought to have looked about for a loophole, and found it in the fact, or alleged fact, of the flag being down, or the captain not being on board at the moment, or the registry not having been renewed, or the owner not having paid up the rent of his house at Hongkong, or the Colonial Ordinance not having been regular, or YEm not having been properly informed, or something or other. On finding the desired loophole, these gentlemen ought to have gone to dinner, drunk to the memory of the decapitated crew of the lorcha, and joined next Sunday with additional fervour in the prayer for peace in their time. A variation upon this advice has been that immediately on this awkward occurrence the whole British community ought to have been mesmerized into an absolute standstill, ,the ships of war and merchantman alike to have remained at anchor, the chests of tea and bales of silk to have been arrested in tran.situ, and hung up for the space of ninety days, till the advice of HER MNJxsTy's Government could have been taken as to the next move. For all that appears, it is intended that even had YEr, emboldened by impunity, seized the crews of aU the lorchas and the persons of aU the Chinese-born subjects domiciled and connected with Hongklong and put them to death, besides confiscating all the lorchas as not being really British vessels, Sir Joim BOWrtING and the worthy Admiral ought to have regarded these unpleasant occurrences in no other light than as a trial to their Christian forbearance. No doubt, the attitude of BR1TANA at Hongkong has long been that of " Patience on a monument," and that makes it all the more easy. The advice tendered directIy to HER MATEsTys M,inisters is, that on the receipt of this intelligence they ought to have superseded all RHp NL4JEAST's servants at Hongkong and at the mouth of the Canton River, sent a humble apology to Yan, and performed whatever ceremonial penance his barbaxic invention might devise. At the same time, they ought to have provided in the Budget for the trifling account which the Americans would be likely to send in. This done, they might employ the remainder of the year in so arranging our intercourse with China as to guard against any interference -with her general liberty of decapitation, and any assumption of undue importance on the part of HEnR It&rJESnS officefs in those regions. This is substantially the advice which has 'been tendered for the best public reasons, on the clearest legal grounds, and on the purest Christian motives, by all who wish Hss MJsWsTY'sGovernment every possible harm. It was repeated last night with some interesting varieties of circumstance and expression. Mr. ROuNDaELL PALME thought that even now we ought not to persevere in the course we had talens We ought1 in bia opiuiop3 to conSider
that the Chinese, poor creatures, are simple, ignorant people, and, like others of that class, rather touchy. So we ought, even now, to spare their feelings, and let them have any number of human heads, or any other playthings, they might take a fancy to. Mr. x G1Bsox's advice was more ingenious. It was that we should have referred the matter in dispute to the Emperor of CHtmA, and respectfully waited for his decision. He might have reprimanded CommiSSiOner YEH, and he might, on the other hand, have demanded the heads of all the British officials, of all the merchants, army, and navy in that part of the world, not to speak of a return of the Chinese ransom paid by him on the score of the last war. Of course, we should have been ready to stand by the reference, and submit to this decision.
The candid Englishmen who tender this advice with so mnch unction and philanthropy are careful not to observe a little fact with an important bearing on the value of their counsels. The intelligence of these transactions arrived about two months after the date, when it was impostible to say what further steps had been taken on either side, or would be taken before orders could get out. It takes, at the least, 90 days for a question to be answered from Canton to London, and vice versA. At this very moment we are wholly ignorant of what has been done, and many events are at least possible which would make a vote of censure most painfully ridiculous. It is quite possible that under the continued defection of our Chinese servants and fellow-subjects, through the peculiar way in which the Mlandarins choose to carry on the war-that is, by poisoning, assassination, and, above all, by putting to death all the relatives of those who hold to the British connexion-our authorities may deem it necessary to strike a blow. There is already in the Chinese waters a greater force than is commonly imagined. Besides four American men-of-war and eight from other civilized States, there are eighteen British men-of-war, including the Calcutta, of 80 guns, the Naniin, of 50 guns, the Pique, of 36, and the Sybille, of 44, the whole force mustering more than 300 guns. Although gunboats of a low draught are much wanted for effectual military operations, still it is said that every one of these vessels could be brought to bear on Canton, and that even the Calcutta could be brought near enough to throw shells into the city. There is no knowing, then, what has been done; and they who are best acquainted with the feelings of the whole European community out there think it very likely that a much more serious blow has been struck than any which we have yet heard. For anything we know, the Chinese may ere this have been brought to reason, and a few days may bring news of a peace with China,-an event not more improbable than the now happily concluded peace with Persia was but the other day. This we mention to show the utter absurdity of pretending to advise, to check, and direct our reDresentatives out there with very great minuteness. As we have said before, we must send out the best men and give them the best instructions. But, with the whole convex world between us and them, it is simply ridiculous to attempt more than very prospective instruction, and very retrospective sanction. We must trust our agents. We must give them a general confidence. If we attempt more the advice we send them arrives four months too late for any purpose, and the only result is to aggravate the failure, or to discredit the success. They are on the spot. They know the people. They know even the law better than our people do generally at home, and decide certainly with less factious bias than is displayed by our lawyers in Parliament. So, unless the case is very decided against them, HER MAjEsrTs Government has no choice but to support them and to strengthen their hands.
The greater the distance too, and the greater the responsibility of our representatives, the less time is there for all the candid and dispassionate criticisms which these gentlemen recommend to HxR MAJESTYS advisers. Seven weeks is the intelligence coming home, seven weeks is the despatch going out-fourteenvweeks altogether to and fro. But were it a fight in our own streets, were YEn and his myrmidons ensconced in a suburb of this metropolis, destroying everybody that fell into his hands, there would hardly be less time for delay. Any Government would be held very culpable that deiberated more than two or three days on the question what was to be done, or that allowed a week' to pass without sending reinforcements to a British Governor and Admiral at that distance in a position to require them. For our own part, we will frankly say that, even if we had felt a misgiving that all had not been done wisely, or that the British Governor and Admiral niight have at least temporized a little more, we should have sent immediate aid and encouragement, at all events, and certhinly not any criticisms of a sort to paralyze the movements of the men fighting our battles afar off. More than this, we feel very sure that in all the ranks of the triple Opposition-among all the men who have delivered such formal accusations or such angry tirades against the conduct of HER MAAESTY'S Government in this affair, there is not one who, in LordPA.&nERssTox's place, would not have done asi he did. We are persuaded there is not one, who, instead of succour and good wishes, wouldSi have sent cold advice, hungry cautions, and bitter' rebukes, instead of men, ships, and munitions ofi war. We should be ashamed to suppose ourselvesl quicker to stand by our countrymen, or warmer to sympathize with their difficulties, than other, Englishmen, and therefore we doubt not that: Lord DERBY, Mr. Gr.DsTo.Z-, and M1r. Corrimx himself, would have done their best to strengthen and even encourage their fellow-countrymen against a crowd of treacherous and brutal barbarians. Three days were about all the time we should have had for the momentous decision, but we should not have wanted three. One day would have been enough, and the decision of that one day we should not have repented of. Certainly, no reason has been given for repenting of it thus far. All the repentance we owe with regard to China is the weakness of having permitted her
so long to cheat us out of the fulfihnent of her
obligations. That we do repent; not the demand of apology for a violent outrage on a vessel under British protection, or the adoption of the only means of redress in our
power. We express these feelings, not as
our own alone, but as those natural to all Englishmen. The result of an appeal to the country will prove that we are not mistaken in this estimate of our national spirit; for even a triple coalition of
party chiefs will not muster a majority of the British constituency round its questionable tricolour.
If a proof were wanting of the necessity of un-
If a proof were wanting of the necessity of unceasing watchfulness wsith regard to our inlitary Vstkni and the promised reforms, it would be found in the unhappy episode of the Crimean Commission and the Chelsea Inquiry. Can any one doubt that Lord PALmSrox, an experienced politician, Lord PAN.mWBE, a shrewd Scotchman, and their colleagues or subordinates, all with ample means of formling a judgment, are and have been perfectly convinced that Sir JoEi MNmNEa and Colonel TvLLOcH wer fully justified in al that they ad-
vanced, that their facts were correct and their deductions sound, and that the report which they sent in ws creditable to themselves anl useful to the country? Yet it is plainly evident, in spite of exculses and faint, longdelayed praise, that Binisters have been anxious to escape from expressing any approval of the Commissioners, and were, in fact, annoyed by the truthfulness and acumen with which they had performed their task. We fully believe that the sympathies of the Ministerial chiefs as well as their convictions were on the side of those who condemned the incapacity displayed in the war; yet, so powerful and united is the band which for so many years administered our military affairs, and still in great part preserves its supremacy, that even a popular Ministry with a whole nation to back it thought it as well not to be too cordial to Sir JoH- 3M!bTnL and his colleague. Even now, when the details of the war are becoming trite, when interest is waning, and the passions of the moment are cooling down to a degree which allows sensible officers and sensible civilians to be of pretty much the same opinion, the Cabinet of Lord PrAr.esTox still would rather not confer any marked honour on such inconvenient truthltellers as the Crimean Commissioners. Certain correspondence has lately passed between Lord PAximny and Sir J. AFNxua,. Those who read it in another column will be able to judge for themselves of the spirit in which any man who condemns, even moderately and incidentally, the doings of the military world must expect to be treated by a 3minister of State.
The recent address of the Liverpool merchants and the remarks made in the House of Commons extorted at length some official approbation for the labours of the Commissioners. Lord PAx-rsmsToN announced some time since that HEB MAJESrY's Government were in communication with the Commissioners respecting the proper acknowledgment and recompense of their services. In answer to a gubsequent question, he owned that a gratuity of 1,0001. to each was the reward which the Government had determined to offer, and that this sum had in both eases been, " not " indignantly, but most courteously, declined." We are now able to lay before our readers the terms in which this delicate acknowledgment of publie services was proffered. To the courtesy and tact of Lord PAmriMRn was committed the task of soothing the wounded feelings of two ill-treated gentlemen by the public offer of 1,0001. apiece. The Secretary for War seems, from his style, to have had no misgiving as to the decency of the offer and no doubt of its acceptance. A thousand pounds must, he thought, touch them nearly. Ris Lordship comes to the point at once. " I have the honour to acquaint you that " Hun M.JEsry's Government have decided to "mark the services rendered by you in the dis"charge of your duties in the Crimea by tendering "to each of you the sum of 1,0001." As this decision was of the latest, Lord PAN.ArurmR feels called upon to add some remarks to his " tender." The next sentence is so completely original in reasoning, taste, and style that we must also give it entire:-
" This grant is intended, not as a mere pecuniary equivalent for the results of your inquiries, but to convey likewise in the manner which appears to them most proper the recognition by Eier Majesty's Government of the zeal and ability with which those inquiries were conducted, to which Lord Palmerston in his plsce in Parliamenxt has already borne testimony."
The first part of this sentence has been taken by Sir Jorsn MlNEILL as a sneer at the national advantages derived from his labours. Lord PANNMRE may certainly be considered to hint that 1,0001. represented the full benefit the country received, and therefore Sir J. M'NRML was presented with the sum; but, as the War Secretary evidently wishes to be polite, we are constrained to think that in talking of an "equivalent for the results" of the Commissioners' inquiries he had no definite meaning, or at least only wished to draw a comparison between their labours and those of persons who were despatched to the Crimea in other capacities. But the assertion that to offer a gratuity of 1,0001. was the "manner which appeared " most proper" to reward the ready, laborious, and skilful services of a veteran old Diplomatist and a Colonel in the army is certainly something new and startling. The higher departments of the public service are, as we are accustomed to pride ourselves, filled by men who do not place pecuniary emoluments foremost among the objects of their life. If a man wants to make a fortune he had much better enter a counting-house than attach himself to a Legation on the continent, or buy a commission in the army. It has always been a part of oursystem to presume that public men are not influenced by a hope of gain, or fitly rewarded by its attainment; and, though we know that Ministers and Anabassadors, soldiers and sailors, must live, it has been customary to confer pecuniary rewards in such a manner as not to gire them undue prominence, to lower the tone of the service, or to hurt the feelings of the rocipients.
What shall we say, then, to such a transaction as the present 1 Sir Jor,x r'NEsrL was formerly Representative of England at the Court of Teheran; he is a Grand Cross of the Bath, and holds a responsible office in Scotland. Colonel TuLLocH is an officer in the army, and acknowledged to be a man of great skill in statistical science. The former was selected by the Government at a time of great embarrassment for an important service. He chose as his colleague the officer whose name is now asociated with his. Both went out charged with the most delicate and invidious of tasks. Theirs was no mere ordinary service, which could be performed by ordinary men, and fitly rewarded by a payment of expenses and a gratuity for trouble taklen; it was a mission requiring judgment, discretion, personal influence, diplomatic skill, observation, knowledge of military affairs, and knowledge of Eastern countries. These are qualities which are fournd only in the higher class of our public servauts, military and civil, among the men whose devotion is not to be bought for money, and who look on honour, reputation, the approval of Government, and the esteem of their countrymen as the higher objects of ambition. Yet, these two men, eminent for their past services, eminent for the skill with which they performed their latest task, it is now
proposed to rbeompense by an order on the Treasury for 1,0001. a-piece.
It need not be said that the inullting offer was at once rejected by both. Sir JOHn MNEILL expresses his gratification at receiving, however late, the thanks of the Government, and declares his wish that his services should continue to be considered gratuitous. Colonel TuLLocH replies in the same style. So far, then, the affair is at an end. The Government say that such duties as were performed by the Commissioners are not worthy of honour or advancement, while the Commissioners decline to have them estimated in money. Sir Joml M'NE and Colonel TuLLoCH
'will have the satisfaction of having served their I country for nothing, and of receiving no reward but that general esteem, which will be more freely extended -to. them now that this last act of discourtesy is made pubEc. But the nation has not done with~ the general question. The Commissioners on one aide, Lords LUCAS and CAnaOAN I with Quartermasters and Commissaries-General on the other, are merely the figures that represent certain principles at work in our aoeialand military system. What concerns us closely is to know whether Euch e6il as have recently become notorious may
not be exposed by official men withlot fear of incurrng odium from their superiors, and perhaps ruining their owvn career. Is the Govemetaut till so far bound to a system and a set of men who have had their trial and their failure that any public servant deputed to inquire into public calamitie5 must perforce conceal, and distort, and expliai
away, and produce a report which shall not be inconvenient to any high-placed delinquent ? The question is a serious one, for we may rest assured that few who may be intrusted with such duties will fail to have before their eyes the fate of the Crimean Commission.

The Frauds On The City Of London Union.
THiE FRAUDS ox TIHE Cm oP LoxNox Uinow. -A statement has been subrtitted to the Poor Law Board by the Guardians of the Poor of the City of London Union Fhowing the circumstances under which the late frauds upon the union were committed by Charles Guerrino Manini, late collector, and by John Paul, lat assistant-clerk to tho union. Appended to the statement is a report from Mr. Morgan, the accountant, fromn which it appears that the deficiencies in the eight parishes for which
idanini was collector amount to 22,407t 8s. 4d. Thesw deficiencies occurred between the years 1843 and 1856. The gnardians ask advice from the Board upon various points.
or i cestano, they desire to know whether the parishes named are liable to pay again the sum of which they were defrauded by Manini; whether the parish officers are liable; and if the ratepayers aro liable again to pay their rates, and if it be the duty of the gaardians to seek to recover them. The Poor Law Board, in their answers to these questions, refer first to the case of Paul, and, after recapitulating the circumstancesS, Ltate that Paul stole a check for 50. and approriated it to his own ue The guardians must there ore draw another check upon their treasurer for the amount, which will necessarily be charged to the common accomunt of the union, as in the case of any other contractor. The case of Manini, however, the Board says, is somewhat more difficult. The statemnent then alludes to the course of business adopted by the board of guardisus, and in conclusion gives an opinion to the ecfct that the parishes in Manini's district arcentitledto indsst upon a statementof the accounts as last rendered, and which have been cloeed and audited. To the extent to which the accounts maxy be incorrect by reason of the embezzlement of Manini the loss must be borne by the common fund of the guardis. The Board defcr their opinion as to the liAbility on the default since then. They state, however, that the payments made by the ratepayers to Manini before his dismissal are perfectly valid in regard to those ratepayers, and they cunot be calUcd upon to repay them. In consequence of a further communication from the board of guardians, a reply has been received from the Poor LAw Board, datod February 23, in wvhich the Board disclaims the idea of givin& umbrage to the guardians, and states that its only anxety is to afford to the guardians its best assistance in tho efforts they are maldng to extricate themselves from the heavy embarrassments in which the negligence and fraud of their officers have planed them.

[A portion of the fo!lowdg a, i in our £eoond editii of yesterday :-] mrai u nodJiii
PARTS, MONDAY, MAIecii 2, 6 P.M.
I omitted to mention yesterday that a telegraphic despat.sh from Vienna announced that on the 23d February the Mtoldavian troops occupied and garrisoned the towns of Bolgrad, Tsmail, and Reni, surrendered by the Russians in pursuance of ~he Treaty of Paris. The same despatch mentions {hat the Russians were expected to take possession of Eomrat and the new territory on the Upper Yalpucksome time between the 20th of February and 1st of March, at which period the boundary would he defined.
The resolution adopted by the directors of the Bank of France at their meeting on Thursday last, to receive for discount commercial bills having 90 days to run, has given great satisfaction, and has created a considerable movement among commercial men in Paris. This measure will not have any effect in affordingaccommodation with regard to commercial transactions already concluded, as payments have been made during the last six months in bills at from 60 to 75 days, but it will have an enormous effect on future dealings, and will, no doubt, produce considerable activity in the spring trade now about to open. Business among the manufacturers and shopkeepers last week was particularly dull. There wrere a few purchases made by country shopkeepers, but they were of insignificant amount and were paid for in cash. One consequence of the construction of railways is, that country dealers avail themselves of the facility of transport, and make purchases in small quantities according as they dispose of their stocks on hand. The great obstacle at present existing to the improvement of trade is the excessive price of the raw materials used in manufactures, which deters purchasers; and the price of those article3, instead of diminishing, is gradually increasing. The trifling rise in the French' cornmarkets at the beginning of last month has not been maintained. Wheat is again offered at a reduction in all the markets. The weather has lately been highly favourable to the growing crops, and a good harvest will bring forth an enormous quantity of grain, which has been held back in anticipation of a scarcity. There was but little business transacted in the Pails corn-market last week. Good wheat from the north was offered at 30f. and 29f. the hectolitre, and second quality at 26f. and 23f. Thle holders of flour endeavoured to maintain prices, but the bakers showed no disposition to make purchases. 79f. the sack of 157 kilogrammes were realized for flour of the first quality at the be,ginning of the week, bat lowver prices were quoted at the last market, and a further fall would have ensued but for a few buyers from Bordeaux and Toulouse, where prices are higher than in Paris. The reserve of flour in the market stores has risen to 9,000 metrical quintals. The high price of buteher's meat in Paris is still kept up. In order, if possible, to counteract this tendency, and to render this essential article of food more accessible to the less wealthy classes, the Government has resolved to establish a central cattle-market for the supply of Paris, but no choice has yet been made among the various companies wvho have proposed to establish one.
The Con.siitutioa0nel devotes an article to the question of " rents," and thus traces the cause of the existing scarcity and dearness of lodgings:
"Renuts, like capital, and like all sorts of merchandise, arm governed by the universal law of demand and supply. They wvere low wvhen the population left Paris in consequence o' the Revolution of 1848; they are high to-day because fresh inhabitants are attracted by the influence of business or by he pleassures of civilization. It has been remarked that when two workmen apply to a master wages fall, but they rise when two masters apply to one workman. The sane may hi said of rents. Workmen and masters, tenants and houseowners, all seek to make the most of their position. A very general opinion appears to prevail that rents have augmente l in consequence of the numbers of houses that have been Tu1led down. This is a great mistake, as thePrefect of the seino has demonstrated in the most complete manner. Thus, the number of houses pulled down in the last five years sanounts to 2,524, while the number of new buildings i; 5,238, or more than double the formner. Inquiries made in the arrondissements of St. Deais and of Sc6aux show that in the suburbs the houses newly constructed exceel sixfold the number pulled down. Thus, we find that in Paris and the suburbs 18,594 houses have been built, in the room of 4,687 houses pulled down. another error, equa'ly prevalent, is contradicted by the Prefcot, namely, that the old houses were more subdivided and contained a grcatcr~ proportion of lodgings than those reocently constructed in their place. It is thus shown that the increase of rents does not proceed either from the diminution of the number of houses or of the number of lodgings. To what, then, are we to attribute this dearness? The cause is clearly stated by the Prefcot; it proceeds from the rapid increase of the population of the capital, from the number of foreigners and persons from the provinces, attracted by the facility of communication. In five years the population of the capital has increased to the extent of 305,000 souls, and we can scarcely experiecne astonishmnent at the supply of accommo. dlation not corresponding with that vast demand. 13ouses cannot be built by enchantment. There is a limit to the capital apphied to building; but, as the money invested in houses gives so excellent an interest, the building movement, far from diminishing, cannot fail to spread. The inceasuat multiplication of lodgings will compel a fall in rents. The latter have been augmented by a momentary cause. It is thc unexpected increase of population that has produced the evil, which will disappear when the number o buildings shall have been placed on an equality with the newv requirements, a resutlt that cannot long be delayed, thanks to the measures of the A dministration."

CONSTANTINOPLE, FEIS. 20.
The religion of the Sultan hass been seriously alarmed within the last few days by an incident which occurred within the precincts of the Old Seraghio, and whEich might have injured the sacred prestige with which he is surrounded in the eyes of his peiople as the successor of the Prophet and the Ehalils. It wvould seem that some jealousy had arisen between the agas, or retired eunuchs, of wvhich there are a great number in the Old Seraglio, and the keeper of the Imperial Treasury, and they accused this functionary of having thrown into a well, and of having otherwnise injured, some of the holy relics wvhich are deposited in the Treasury. The guardianship of these relics, which are very much venerated by the Mahometans, is one of the first duties of the Sultan, and he is bound to hand them down intact to his ""^^^A"A_ - ~ ~ ~ ~ an
successor. The Sultan was filled with horror at the news of the sacrilege; he sent at once for the delinquent and submitted him to a minute examiination; this one confessed that he had dared to touch without permission those sacred objects, but it was only to remove some old coverings with which they had been enveloped for eenturies, and which had rotted, and that it was these that he had thrown into the well. The well was at the same time searched and these old coverings were found in it. A commission has been appointed to judge the treasurer, who will be probably exiled for a time; and, as it became necessary to quiet the
fears of the faithful, who were already gettin g alarmed at the fate of those sacred paUadZia of M ahomedanism, the Council of Ministers assembled yesterday at the Imperial Treasury, in the Old Seraglio, and carefully examined all the sacred relics, and reported them to be all intact.
The statutes 6f the proposed Bank have been translated into French and Turkish, and a commission of two English, two French, and two Austrian
merchants, and of six Turkish ofEicials, has been appointed to examine and report. Mr. Black and Mr.
Xanson are the English, MM. 1J. Alleon andi David (Glavany the French, and hM . s. Flori and
Aristide Baltazzi the Austrians, selected for this mission. To-morrow (Saturday) the commission will hold its first meeting, and probably it will not be very long before it sends in its report; and there is every probability that the commission will agree to the adoption of the statutes, as most of its members have already expressed themselves in their favour.
The struggle for independence which the Circassians have been so long and so perseveringly maintaining against Russia seems likely to be renewed with fresh vigoar In the Spring, and perhaps with improved means of resistance. Finding themselves quite ignored by the Allies in the stipulations for the Peace of Paris, they have not despaired of the success of their cause. They have determined to put themselves under the government of one chief, who is to be elected by the suffrages of the elders of the different tribes; and the candidates for this honour, of which the two principal are old Sefer Pasha and the Naib Mehemed Emin Effendi, have declared that they are ready to obey and assist whoever is chosen. Jn the meantime they are using every effort to get up a regular army and provide themselves with the necessaries of war. An expedition has been equipped here by the friendsof the cause, and sailed a few days ago in an English steamer, the Kangaroo, chartered for the purpose, for Vardan on the coast of Circassia, the seaport of the Ubonkli. It is commanded by a Polish officer of distinction, lately in the Polish Legion, and consists of about 200 men, soldiers and non-commissioned officers of the same force, and about 10 officers. They are fuly equipped and provided with stores and ammunition, and with six pieces of artillery suited for mountain warfare. These men have been got together entirely by private effort and by private expense, and so secretly has the expedition been got up that it only reached the ears of the Russian Ambassador when the steamer was ready to sail; but it was detained by the frightful gale of wind which raged here a few days ago. The Russian Ambassador protested immediately, but the Turkish Government had not heard anything about the matter. I will make you acquainted hereafter with the fate of the expedition.

VIENNA, FEB. 28.
The assertion of a German paper, that the discord which prevails in Germany is mainly to be attributed to the perverseness of the smalUer Federal States, has led to a reply in the Frankfort Joutrnul, which cannot fail to produce a singularly unpleasant impression in Austrian official circles. The German organ of the Bund declares that the polcy of Austria is the principal cause of the disunion complained of by its contemporary, and thus criticizes one of the more recent measures of the Imperial Government:-
"The Conoordat is an insuperable barrier to the unitr of Germany. It has produced a total change in public opinion in respect to Austria, and it inspires the Germans with equal distrust and aversion. What is the cause of th indifference or rather of the dishke of Germany to the grea, plans of Austria ? It is her Ciesarian policy. She hat taken Roman Catholicism and Popery for her allies against German development, German civilization, and Germmn Protestantism. The reports received relative to the wa7 in which the Concordat is being carried out only serva to widen the breach between Catholic Austria ani Protestant Germany. The recent case of the burial of an English Protestant outside the precincts of a churchyard in Moravia is an example of the rigour with which the Catholic hierarchy is resolved to carry out the new ordinances relative to the interment of Protestant Christians. If Protestants in Austria are not permitted to rest in the same cemetery with Catholics, the Protestants of Germany will hardly be inclined to sleep side by side with the Catholics of Austria on the same battle-field. As we wrote on the 23d of April, 1856, we write now :-I The Concordat is an insult offered to German civilization, it is a direct attack on German science, and it is an act of opea hostility against the whole of Protestant Germany."'
This article will produce a disagreeable impression here, but it will excite no surprise, as it is well known to the civil authorities that the Concordat is considered a public calamity by full threefourths of the inhabitants of this empire. It is a notorious fact that the convention with Rome produced the worst possible effect in all the Austrian provinces, exceptlng the Tyrol; but still some of the highest persons in the realm have been led to beheve that no measure ever gave more general satisfaction. The Roman Catholic hierarchy is at present endeavoaring to obtain from the faithful the funds necessary for completing and repairing some of the principal churches on the continent. The cathedral of Vienna is to underg,o a thorough repair; the cathedrals of Mayence,and Worms are to be restored; the churches to the Virgin at Munich and Esslingen are to be refreshed; and the cathedrals of Ulm, Strasburg, and Basle are to receive all the necessary attentions at the hands of the masons. The so-called Dom-Paradies, at Spires, has been rebuilt, and the Emperor Fraacis Joseph has conitributed largely towards the construction of this splendid edifice.
This is the last day of the " Carnevalone" at Milan, and great are the preparations which have been made for the closing masked procession. On Wednesday, the 25th, there was a splendid masked ball at the Scala; on Thursday there was to be a grand corso; on Friday a masked ball at the Scala; and on Saturday another grand corso and another grand ball. The latter, however, must end as the clock strikes 12 (midnight). Their Majesties, who wiU be present at the corso, which is to take place on Sunday, the 1 st March, will probably go to Mantua on the 2d. On the 23d and 24th February the Emperor went to the " ateliers" of the principal artists of Milan, and among othersthoseof the sculptorsMagni, Brutti,and Pullerati were honoured with a visit. From time to time it has been said in my correspondence that the favourable impression produced by the presence of their Majesties in the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom was not likely to be lasting, and persons who are much better able to form a correct opinion on the subject than myself now use the same language. The Milan correspondent of the Trieste Zeitung, who is certainly a loyal Austrian, states that the tradespeople have earned less than usual during the carnival, " because the middle classes of the nobility and the higher classes of citizens have taken no share in the festivities of the season." The passage quoted tends to confirm the private news that has reached me, which is, that some few of the higher nobles and almost all the lower classes are now the partisans of Government. The Minister of Finance reached Vienna last night. It is whispered that the journey to the Lombardo-Venetian [ kingdom (including the remission of taxes) is
ikely to cost the State between 20,000,000f. and 30,000,0001., and, if such should prove to be the case, Government "will have paid too much for its whistle."
We learn from Rome that a Franciscan monk and two priests aided and abetted Catherine Fanelli in the impoBtures for which she was condemned to 12 years' imprisonment by the Inq~uisition. The Franciscan will be confined for life in a mnonastery, and one priest will lose his liberty for 12 years. The other priest will escape with three months' imprisonment.

On 'Change at Hamburg yesterday news was spoken of as having arrived there from Singapore to the effect that the Chinese and Malay population of that place had combined together and taken up a very menacing attitude against the English and Germans engaged there in commercial and other pursuits. The latter had in consequence found it expedient to arm themselves. There were other reports also afloat of Admiral Seymour having fired the town of Canton on all sides, but up to the close of 'Change this seemed to be little more than
report. In the evening, however, the Ham-
srger- Borsenhalle stated positively that it had received advices from Hongkong, which had been forwarded thence on the 15th of January, at 2 o'clock p.m., per steamer Madras, which had subsequently touched at Singapore. According to these advices the British war steamer Barracouta lad
brought to Rongkong from Canton the neitthat the fire produced in the outskirts of Canton ty the Briti8h Admiral's bombardment had eextended itself to the town, and that the latter had becoihe one sheet of flame.
Another commercial letter from Hongkong, of January 12, mentions that the loss on foreign goods incurred in the destruction of the foreign factories in Canton wa8 estimated at $1,000,000. The warehouses on the Honan side of the river, opposite to the foreign factories, are still uninjured, but in danger, and the news of the docks and shipbuilding
yards being destroyed there might be expected every day.
Advices from Singapore of Januay 22d state that two companies of Native Infantry, the 20th ReAiment, of the Madras Presidency, which hither'to were stationed at Penang, had been embarkeed the day before on board the screw steamer Sir James Brooke at Singapore for Hongkong. On the urgent representations of the Governor of Hongkong, the Governor of Singapore had already previously sent a company of Rifles of the 38th Regiment of Infantry to Hongkong, in spite of a protest that had been presented to him signed by numerow Europeans against leaving the colony so bare of military protection at the present time,

A telegraphic despatch from Naples, dated the 28th of February, announces that the Queen of Naples was happily delivered of a Prince on that day at Caserta.
The Cattolico of Genoa publishes a letter from Naples of the 21st, mentioning another explosion which took place three days before in the fort of Vigliena, on the sea-side between Naples and Port.ici, but caused litte damage. The letter adds, that upon examination it was found that both this explosion and that of the Carlo IIL were owing to the spontaneous ignition of a peculiar compound invented for military purposes by one of the officers who perished on board the abovementioned vesseL This compound had been made up into various kinds of projectiles
which were kept in small quantities in various places. Experience now shows that it has the serious defect of igniting spontaneously, which renders it unfit for service.

Tuesday Evening.
The quotation of gold at Paris is about 6 per mille premium, and the short exchange on London is 25.25 per 11. sterling. On comparing these rates with the English Mtint price of 3l. 17s. 10id. per ounce for *tandard gold, it appears that gold is nearly 3-lOths per cent, dearer in Paris than in London.
By advices from Hamburg the price of gold is 424 per mark, and the short exchange on London is 13.5 per 1L sterling. Standard gold at the English Mint price is therefore nearly 5-lOths per cent. dearer in London than in Hamburg.
The course of exchange at New York on London for bilLs at 60 days' sight is 108k per cent., which, when compared with the Mint par between the two countries, shows that the exchange is against Enland; but, after making allowance for charges of transport and difference of interest, the present rate leaves no profit on the transmission of gold either way between England and America.
The English funds opened steadily this morning at the improved quotations of yesterday, and have aain experienced an advance of an eighth. Consols for money were first quoted 93j to , at which they remained without alteration up to the afternoon, when a large purchase for the account on the 6th inst. caused a rise to 93i to 94. For the new aceount on the 8th of April the last transactions wereat94Ztoi. Bank Stock left off at 220 to 222; Reduced, 94 to i; New Three per Cents., 94j to;j; India Stock, 219 to 222; Exchequer-bonds, 988to i; India-bonds, 6s. discount to par; and Exchequer-bills (Jfune) 2s. discount to 2s. premium.
In the Stock-Exchange to-day there was a diminution in the demand for money, the India-house having lent at 5i per cent. a portion of the amount lately paid to them by the Great ILdian Peninsula Railway.
Foreign securities were firm, and a further advance took place in Turkish Six per Cents., the operations being at 98j, 97&, 98a, and 98. An increase was also noticeable in general business. Brazilian Five per Cents., New, were quoted 103: Buenos Atres, 86; Grenada, Deferred, 6a; Mexican, forthe account, 22j, t, and ,; Peruvian, for account, 80 and 79 ; Portuguese Three per Cents., 46k; Russian Four-and-a-Hlf per Cents., Small, 99j and98; SardinianFive per Cents., 91 ; Spanish Three per Cents., 4o0, -1, and i; for the account, 41; the New Deferred, for account, 24-; Spanish Certificates, 6a, i, and i; Venezela, for account, 37 ; and butch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 65.
In the foreign exchanges this afternoon there was no alteration of importance, with the exception of Hamburg, which was a shade higher.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 70f. 90c. for money, and nf. 45c. for the new account at the end of the month, showing a fresh improvement of a half per cent.
About 23,0001. in gold was withdrawn from the Bank to-day for exportation.
The precise amount of specie shipped by the Peninsular and Oriental steamer Indus is 792,1601., of which only 69261 is gold, 469,388l. being silver for Bombay, Midras, Calcutta, Penang, and Singspore, and 3'26,8461, 'for Hongk-ong, Canton, and
The commercial advices from New York this week describe a tendency to heaviness in the stock market consequent upon an increawd demand for money. Erie Railway was quoted 57i; Reading, 78k; N%ew York Central, 88 to i; Panama, 921 ; and Illinois Central, 134. The importations of manufactured goods from Europe were extremely large, their value in the first t^wo weeks of February having been equal to that of the total for the whole corresponding month of last year. This circamstance alone caused a considerable absorption of bullion, the Customs' duties being all paid in specie and deposited in the Government vaults. At the same time the large cotton shipments in progress contribuAted to increase the general activity and to create a drain to NewOrleans. Theratefor the best paper was therefore again as high as 10 per cent, The gold brought by this packet is only 45,0001., and the whole is for Messrs. Rothschild on account of the Bank of France. It was expected, however, that remittances of an ordinary character would recommence in the course of two or three weeks. The New York and New Haven Railway had declared a dividend of 3 per cent., but an injunction against it had been obtained in the Supreme Court. This is the company of which Mr. Robert Schuyler, a year or two back, acting as president with ful power issued fictitious shares, and which, unlike the Royai Swedish Railway, the Crystal Palace, and the Great Northern Railway Companies in London, forthwith repudiated the acts of its own officers. Some attention had been attracted by an alleged discovery by a Dr. Benjamin Harding, of a method for the liquification of quartz rock, by which every particle of gold it may contain is precipitated, the snilceous solution being afterwards capable of solidification in any form for building purposes. His s'atements are backed by certificates of respectable chymists and metallurgists, but experience has abundantly shown, in the case of other equally wonderful processes, the ease with which such persons allow themselves to be deluded. From California the Governor's message to the Legislature had been received. He announces the expenditure of the State to be 70,0001. in excess of its revenue, and complais of general disorder in its financial arrangements. With regard to the repudiated debt a suggestion is made that a sum of 500,0001., paid into the Federal Treasury in the shape of Customs' duties prior to the admission of California to the Union, and which is asserted to be available for the wants of the State, should be applied to its discharge. The Mexican advices of a treaty having been signed for a loan by the American Government of 3,000,0001. to that republic on the security of 15 per cent. of the receipts of the Custom-houses seem improbable, and at all events require confirmation. Nevertheless the statement appears to have been accepted waithout much question by the New York papers. The matter is important to the English bondholders, who find it impossible to obtain fulfilment of their claims on the MIexican revenue.
The weekly reviews from the Amsterdam and Rotterdam produice markets state that business continued moderately active, and that the late advance in prices was fully supported. Sugar, coffee, tea, and indigo attracted the principal attention, and purchases of rice had been made at a slight improvement. The letters from Rouen mention that the operations in the markets for manufactures have not been extensive, although the attendance of buyers has rather increased.
At a half-yearly meeting of the Mexican and South American Company held to-day, Mr. W. H. Schneider presiding, the statement made by the directors was adopted. The vessels arrived from the 1st of January, 1856, to the 3d of March, 1857, have brought 2,945 tons of copper regulus, containing 1,818 tons of copper, and the regulus made from the 1st of January to the 29th of November was 52,778 quintals, or 2,399 tons. Past difficulties havinc, been surmounted and the management abroadreorganize, the directors have liquidated the debt of $630,000 due to the former agents, and placed the company on a better footing. Although the produce recently has not increased, owing to the quality of the ores treated, the quantity smelted shows that the furnace power is capable of augmented returus. As the arrangements for the
supply ot rich ores are progressing and the establishment is in efficient order, it is hoped a resumption of dividends may before long be announced. An
error of 12,0001. to 13,0001. discovered in the ac- I counts since they were made up on a previous occasion has been rectified, and the loss of copper through the amount reniaining in the slags has been greater than was estimated. At the close there was a vote of confidence in the directors.
The advices from Ceylon by the overland mail
yesterday announced that the amended agreements! with the Ceylon Railway Company arrived out on the 10th of December, and received forthwith the sanction of the Legislature.
The tea-market has advanced to-day, and ls. lid. per pound has been paid for about 5,000 chest of common congou.
The shares of the UTnited Mexican Mlining Coinpany to-day experienced an improvement consequent upon advices of which the following is an extract

TQeFd?.y Evening.
The railway-market has been again active, and prices generaly have exhibited much firmness. Inr some cases there has been a further advance of from 5s. to 15s. per share. French were very buoyant, mort de3criptions having been freely operatod in. It is stated that negotiations have been re-opened between the Central and the Orleans Companies for an arrangement. Grand Trunk of Canada and Great Western of Canada were better. Indian shares presented a tendency to improvement. The feature in the market for misemllaneous securities was a rise in United Mexican shares, owing to the receipt of favourable advices. Riga Railway shares closed ]j to j pm.; Punjaub, i to # pm.; and Northern of Bengal, * to i pm. Ottoman Bank were less 1irm, on a statement that the remainder of the capital is about to be caUed up, and that the shares will be required to be sent in for registra. tion.
