Money-Market and City Intelligence.
MON.BY-MARKT and WITYINTELLIGEYC.
Thursday Evening.
The English funds opened this morning at a decline of an eighth, and subsequently experieaced a further fall. The first price of Consols for money was 93i to ;, and, although they remained without alteration to the official close, transactions ultimately took placo at 93 to J for money, and 934 to I for the oth of February. For the March account the latest price was 932 to J. The fact of the Bank of England having abstamed from adopting at their Weekly Court to-day any increased restrictions exercised no material influence, a belief having beconie general yesterday afternoon that, owing to the drain of gold to the continent having been thus far neutralized by the amounts returned from Ireland, the position of the establishment has not yet experienced any adverse change. The chief cause of the general heaviness seems still to consist in the desire of certain operators to realize,while the speculators for an advance, iD the present uncertainty regarding the futuire value of money, have all retired from the market. Bank Stock left off at 216 to 218; Reduced, 93g to i; New Three per Cents., 93i to i; India Stock, 219 to 221; and Indiabonds 3s. discount to par. Exchequer-bills were considerably affected by the demand for money, and left off at 6s. to 2s. discount.
In the Stock Exchange to-day the rate for loans on Government securities ranged from 6 to 6i per cent. In the discount-market the demand was very active, and it is believed that at the Bank of England the applications were extensive both before and after the rising of the Court, evidence being thus afforded that the heavy requirements yesterday were from an actual scarcity, and not from a desire to provide against a possible increase in the rate.
Foreign securities were heavy, and prices generally experienced a decline. Business, however, was limited through the arrangement of the account.

The final quotation of the French Three per Cents. on the Pafis Bourse this evening was {i7f. 50c. for both money and account, showing a recovery of three-eighths per cent.
The tone of the private letters from Paris to-day is rather less desponding. During the week there has been a succession of rumours on the Bourse, which have served to indicate the restlessness of the speculators, but which are all believed to be without definite foundation, At the commencement the most general assertion was that the Bank of France were to inerease their capital so as to be able to make larger advances on stock. Subseqiuently it was said these advances were to be to the Government. The next rumour was that relief was to be obtained in some incomprehensible manner by the formation of an international bank, and that the concession had been already granted for it. Next it was stated that the Government had decided to increase its resources by imposing a heavy tax on railroads, and a consequent depreciation took place in all that class of securities. The latest assertion is that a Government loan for 4,000,0001. sterling is to be raised forthwith. Each of these rumours has had some temporary effect, and if not replaced by others they will all probably continue to circulate until tho pending liquidation is terminated, and the demand for money consequent on the approaching payment of the final instalment of 1,560,0001. on the last loan shaU have subsided.
Th-e accounts from the German money-markets appear nmore favourable than for some time past. Capital is becoming more abundant, and there is a disposition on the part of the public to make investments.
There were no gold withdrawals from the Bank of England to-day, but the exchange at Paris seems to be declinina to a point at which gold will be likely to be sent tiither as a remittance.
It may be hoped that the news of the State debt of California having been declared unconstitutional and void will beget some extra caution on the part of the English public with regard to investments in American securities. It will be said, perhaps, that the condition of California is exceptional, and that no sweeping conclusion is to be drawvn from anything that may happen in that State. But the event which has just occurred is merely a repetition of pist experience. Mississippi, Michigan, Arkansas, and Florida adopted a similar course nearly 20 years ago, and have maintained it ever since. Yet the two former are among the most prosperous States of the Union, and their conduct is rendered the more striking, since, while owing to the one being a Southern and the other a Northern State, they a-re opposed to each other on some of the broadest points of policy, they exhibit perfect unanimity on the question of repudiation. Again, although Illinois and Indiana have hesitated to follow these examples, and have been for some years allowed to class themselves among the respectable and paying States, it must not be forgotten that Illinois merely discharges a portion of her interest, and that Indiana forced her creditors to accept a compromise under tho threat that they must be content with that or nothing. These are matters of history, and it is due to New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and all the other States that properly fulfil their obligations, no less than to those persons on this side who may be disposed to seek American investments, that they should be kept constantly in view. At the same time, in doing justice to the more honest States, it is necessary to point out that, although these States are not to be made responsible for the acts of their neighbours, over -whose domestic administration they have no more control than Englandhas over that of France, therestill are reasons vhy the warning afforded by the lapses that have occurred should be held in some degree to apply to all American securities. The public opinion of the 'whole of the States hias a controlling influence on the appointment of Ministers under the Federal Government, and when it is recollected that for the past four years one of the highest and most powerful offices in the Cabinet at Washington has been filled by the leading advocate of Mississippi repudiation, without a feeling being expressed in any quarter that such views soiaolld operate in the slightest degree as a disqualification, it is impossible not to see that there is no part of the country the financial reputation of wlhich is not weak-ened by the circumstance. Setting aside, however, all arguments of this description there is a paramount reason for the constant exercise of prudence, which should always be kept in mind by investors, but of which nine-tenths of them are wholly ignorant. This consists in the fact that each State has a separate constitution, ancl that many of these constitutions contain conditions in some cases distinct, and in others vague, limiting the borrowving powers,hbothof the executi-e and the legislative authorities. In the principal countries of Europe the idea either of a written or unwvritten constitution being brought forward to effect the evasion of a debt which had received the sanction of all the governing bodies for the time beinog would be considered as too objectionable to be entertained, but in the United States, -where the several constitutions
are so compact as to bring their technical peculiaritie wvithin the knowledge of most persons, a different feelinig has grown up. In the State of New York no loan can be contracted beyond 200,0001. without a special vote of the people. In Iowa the limit is 20,0001., in California it is 60,0001., and in Mfississippi there are certain other definite restrictions. In how many cases do the English people, who are prepared to part with their money upon State bonds at the recommendation of agents, take the trouble to become acquainted with the letter of these constitutions? Perhaps it would be impossible to find a single instance. Even in the borrowing States themselves, when the mania for speculation and for raising money is going on, there is sometimes similar neglect, and Americau purchasers are thus occasionally deluded. In the present California case it was remarked by the judges of the Supreme Court, in rather peculiar
phraseology, that there seemed for a long time " to ve been a general disposition to give the subject of the -existing restrictions the go-by." Moreover, the various constitutions are constantly liable to alteration; and hence an edition printed in one year may be essentially different from that of the next. 'In future, therefore, it will be wel for oUr people to understand the risks of this sort to be encountered. In dealing with a State which is able to borrow money through its executive and legislalative bodies, and then to fall back on the clauses of .a conqtitution, they are in the position of
persons making loans to a corporation who iatrust their common seal to directors, managers, and secretaries, and who, "when these persons have borrowed money for their benefit, can turn round and say that under their deed of settlement they had no right to borrow a shilling, and. that consequently they must decline to pay. There can, in short, be no safety for lenders where anything exists that can override the simple fact of a loan havhig been made in good faith under certaia open andl avowed conditions within the cognizance of the whole community. If even a vote of the people be obtained, how can reliance be felt that it may not be upset by the plea that some of the legal forms for taking it were neglected ? If with a full k-nowle(dge of such risks capitalists choose to part Iwith their money, there can be no objection. All
that is urged is, that they should not be lost sight of. The majority of persons will be disposed to believe that, as regards New York and many other States of the Union, they may alvays rely that the equitable view will prevail overthe legalor technicalone, and it is not necessary to seek to disturb this impression. It cannot, however, be otherwise than beneficial to the solidity and permanence of the financial relations of the two countries that every element of those relations should from time to time, when occasion calls, be temperately reviewed, especially as the laxitv which prevails here with regard to the legal questions affecting State bonds is carried to a much greater extent with respect to those of cities and railway companies.
Tlle commercial letters from India to-day were regarded as favourable, the transactions m imported goods having been large both at Bombay and Calcutta. The delivery of the advices from China caused an increase of firmness in the teamarket, and the quotation for common congou is now is. 1t,d. to is. lid. per lb. There is also a good demand for fine teas at higher rates. With regard to the condition of affairs at Shanghai the following, dated the 5th of December, is from Messrs. Cramptons, Hianbury, and Co.:-
"The great scarcity of current coin noticed in our last still exists, and has produced much confusion throughoua the month, business being impeded by quotations and sales effected in two or three mediums-vlz., Carolus dollars sycee silver, and bankers' orders payable in ten days for both dollars and sycee. Our currency is now so complicated that the proposed establishment of a mint at Hongkong under the auspices of the British Government would, we believe, be generally acceptable both to the English and American merchants. In political matters we have nothing fresh to advise, though rumours are current of combined disagreement among the rebels in Nankin. The state of affairs at Canton and the collision which has occurred between the British, American, and Chinese forces has not interrupted the good understanding existing here-the Chinese authorities characterizing the rupture there as a local affair. News from Pekin, with the Emperor's decision of the matter, is, however, looked forward to with sorae anxiety. The English mail of the 10th of September arrived on the 13th ult."
At a meeting of the Mariquita Mining Company held to-day, Mr J. D. Powles presiding, a dividend of Is. per share for the half-year was declared, and the report on the progress of the mines was agreed to. A lengthened discussion took place on she question of an allowance to the directors at the rate of 5001. per annum from the commencement of the undertaking-a period of four years. After an amendment had beenlbrought forward, condemning the purc}.ase of the Purima property, and suggesting the payment of the arrears of dividends before sanctioning the proposed vote, a ballot was taken, when the numbers declared were 39,694 shares in favour of the allowance, and 2,320 against it.
The Crystal Palace Company have issued a circular to their shareholders, stating the result of the examination conducted by Messrs. Quilter, Ball
and Co. into the frauds of Robson, their late transfer clerk. It appears that they amount to 10,9961. in respect of preference shares, 16,8901. in respect of ordinary shares (taking the shares at their par value), and 9151. in respect of receipts for season tickets. It is also notified that arrangements have been made for converting the shares ef the company into stock, which will be submitted to the next general meeting.
The Bank of England to-day ordered a bonus of 10 per cent. on the salaries of the clerks in that establishment for the past year.
A memorial very numerously signed by the leading houses in the wine trade was presented to the Treasury to-day, requesting that the privilege may be granted of bottling foreign wines in bond.
At a meeting of merchants and traders held this morning, Mr. Cattley in the chair, the following resolution on the subject of the duty upon currants, moved by Mr. Travers, and seconded by MIr. Mavrojani, was adopted:-
"' That the recovery of the currant vines in Greece and the Ionian Islands from the disease which has so long prevailed, and the large consequent inereaeeof production, Justily all parties interested in the commeree of these counties in ex pecting that the duty upon currants shall now be reduced to the same amount as that levied upon raisins-a measure that was confessedly only postponed in 1853 from the peculiar circumstances of the supply, which rendered it at that tinie impossible that the consumer would have been benefited or the revenue in any degree recovered. That the adequacy of the present supply is proved by the fact that, vhereas the crop of 1853 only produced 5,060 tons, and that of 1855 did not amount to 8,000 ton., the crop for 1856 exceeds 27,600 tons. That the reduction to ls. wvould, by increasing consumption, tend to the recovery of our trade wfith Greece, without loss to the revenue, and wvould give a fresh impulse to the producers and be a boon to the wrorking classes, who, especially in the manufacturing districts, are the main consumers of this description of fruit."

BRAILWAY IYTELLIGBNCE.
LONDON AND SOUR.=-WFP1RTP
The direc ors of this company have resolved to recommend to the proprietors at the general meeting on the 12th of February nexxt that the dividend for the hi f-year ending the 31st of December, 1856, be at the rate of 61. 10s. per cent. per annum on the capitol of the company, making, with the previous dividend, 6 per cent. for the year.
LONDON, BRIGHTON, AND SOUTH COAST.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday at the Bridge-house Hotel; Mr. L. Schuster in the a air.
The report, an abstract of which has appeared in 27e Times, was taken as read.
The 11,U1RXAs X, in moving the adoption of the report, said it was so falU that it did not require any lengthened remarks from him. Looking at the report before him, the first subject mentioned was the capital account, and they would see that a very small sum remained at present at the disposal of the directors, butit wastheirduty in an expanding traffic to provide the requisite accommodation for the increased business. A railway was a commercial concern, and they required an extension of premises, additional plant, stations, sidings, and so forth, which he need niot specify, and the time was approaching when the smaU balance of capital in hand would be no longer safficient. It would be their duty on a fature occasion, probably in the course of 12 months, to ask their sanction for an application to Par. liament for an increase of capital for such purposes, or otherwise to consider whether they could devote a portion of the increased revenue to such purposes. WVhen the time arrived for providing additional fends they would meet it. With regard to the interest on their debenturo debt, it averaged 41. 2s. per cent., gad, considering the high rates of interest prevailing, he thought the proprietors had every reason to be satisfied with that state of things (hear, hear), wh'ch was a proof that the directors had not neglected their interests. In respect to the expenditure ho would take it for the whole year, as the end of it was the right time to consider their affairs. The increase in the receipts for traffic, as compared with the preceding year, was 57,0001. ; the increase in the expenditure had been 21,000t, or about 37 per cent. of the increased receipts. The increased expenses did not arise entirely from the increased traffic, but only in part- the rest was caused by the increased price of materials ana wages. In fact, everythinghadrisen exceptrail. w4v fares, which Parliament had fixed at a certain rate. Such was the dear state of the currency during the year and the amount held that, instead of having expectations of its declining in value, he thought it woulcd go on increasing. There would be an increase in the price of every article exchangeable for gold. In that expectation they had attended to their interests, and had maintained the permanent way, stations, tunnels, and other works in a most perfect state. The rolling stock, and especially the locomotive power, was kept up in the highest state of efficiency. That was demonstrated by the regularity with which their traffic was conducted, aud the position in which they stood as a railway company. Another important object for the money thus expended was to secure safety to the public. They had expended 51,0001. during the year for renewals or replacements in keeping up everything in a perfect state of efficiency. There was another item of expenditure to which they were subjected that was very large. He alluded to taxation, consisting of rates, taxes, and Government duty, which together amounted to 4S,0001, or above 1 per cent. of their dividend. This in a great measure arose from the gross injustice of rating railways on their profits. If the same system of taxation were adopted in respect to merchants, bankers, and others, the injustice would be more apparent. In their case ittook away asum more than equivalent to yield 1 per cent. dividend, exclusive of the incometax. Seeing the way in which railway property was taxed, it was no wonder that the capital of the countrv was sent out over the world for a fair return. Capital was, in fact, driven out of the country by unjust legislation. The revenue of the railway had largely increased since 1848; it had gradually increased every year with the exception of 1852. In IM4S the revenue of the company had been 453,0001,, and in 1856. 776,0001, showing an increase of 323.0004 This was satisfactory enough, and showed that attention had been paid to their afflirs, while, at the same time, there had not been much added to their capital, and for what they had added they were remunerated very haudsomely. Although the dividend they recommended was at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum for the half-year, the dividend was at the rate of 6 per cent for the year. He did not look upon it as a subject or congratulation. Re would toll them the result of what they had done during the past 17 years; they had'received on the average 31. 17s. 7d. per cent. interest on their outlay. The Brighton sharehoiders commenced operations in 188, and had received since 1840 a dividend of 60. odd, which had paid them 31. 17s 7d. per cent. per annum. Looking at the result of better management he found that during the past nine years the dividend averaged 44 13s. 4d. per cent. The last year's dividend of 6 per cent. must not be solely attr;bnted to their zealous exertions and that of their very zslous staff, but to the wellbeing of the coantry. They were not to suppose that the 6 per cent. was to continue. If their earnings increased, so would their expenses. They:were not to indulge in delusions respecting the oontinued increase of dividend; that for the past year had arisen solely from the general prosperity of the country. He then alluded to a letter that had appeared fin The Times aboat the manner in which Hastings was served by the railway companiess and that the Brighton trains were to be seen crawling along the line, performing the distance in 39 hours. The statement was hardly deserving notice, as the time bills of the company would show that it was not correct. Their express trains performed the distance between Londor. and Hastings in 2 hours and 10 minutes. The Hastings people hai got two lines in consequence of competition, and thus
about 1,000,0004 of capital had been thrown, as it were. into the sea. and the shareholders found that they had spent 2,000,0004 instead of 1,000,0004, and unless they reduced their expenses would never make it pay the interest even on the latter sum. The evil of that mode of legislation would never he put an end to unless shareholders would exert their influence with members of Parliament to rectify it. The directors, at therequest of the officers of the company, had caref ully examined the six stock ledgers belongmig iO the company, and had found the whole of the 8,000 accounts of the propietors' stock perfectly correct. Every item had bcen checked by the directors, and there was not a single error in any discovered. Somo additional checks had been added. Every transfer of stock was examined by the directors and signed by them, He then alluded to two local lines which the landowners, gentry, farmers, and others of the districts through which they were proposed to pss intended to construct at their own expense. One was a line from Lewes to Uckfield, seven miles in length, through a level country, at a cost of 47,0001 The inhabitants were very respectable and there were elements on it of a remunerative traffic. With the sanction of the proprietors they would lease and work the line so as to pay 4 per cent. per annum. on the oatlay, or about 1,8001. a-year. The other line would form an ex. tension of their Horsham branch to Petworth in the southwestern district. The length of the pro"s line was 14i miles. It was merely a surface line, and would cost 7,000l a-mile. The traffic would well pay them for their proposed guarantee of 4 per cent. on the estimated cost. There were schemes for new lines which it woald be their duty to oppose. One was for a line from Beckenham to East Croydon, which would take passengers three miles round and form a competing line to the West Croydon station. The Brghlon Company ran 22 trains eAch way between London and Croydon, making 44 trains per day. The distaDce was 10.1 miles, and the fare for first-class passergers was Is. 6d. and the return ticket 2s.1Jfor 21 miles, and other tickets in proportion. These fares were not the result of compulsion, but the act and deed of the Brighton Company. Periodical tickets were granted at still lower rates. so the people of Croydon had nothing to rumplain of. There was another scheme for extending the Leatnerhead line to Kingston, which they would watch and strenuously oppose. There was also a South London lineone of Mr. Brunel's precious schemes-which, it was believed, was for the purposes of the Great Western Company, and could not cost less than 1,000,0001. He concluded by moving the adoption of the report.
,Mr. Scorr seconded the motion.
A SniAPznEOLDXR, who was opposed to extension lines, moved an amendment to the effect that the paragraph in the report relating to the guarantee of 6,400l. a-year for extension lines be omitted.
Mr. MKwDnSEy, although opposed to branch lines, woald not second it,
Mr. H. BORRAfDATLE believedthesenseof the meetingwas in favonr of the propositions of the directors for working the proposed two new ines at 4 per cent. on the estimated cost. He lieved that the East Grinstead and Horsharm lines returned much more than 4 per cent. on the outlay. He thought it would be satisfactory if the chairman would state what those lines earned.
"'he CiR 1 rAs said they only leased the East Grinstead line; the Horsham branch was constructed by the company in olden times, when cheap lines were nknown. The East Grinstead line paid more than 4 per cent. the first half-year it was open for traffic. The line bad cost the promoters 60,0004, but the Brighton Company paid rent on only 50,M000 The Horsham line was the best paying branch they had. They would have no reason to regret the extension of it to Petworth.
MIr. HsstAP.vs said he had lately been over the whole of the lines of the company, and he was glad to find that the East Grinstead line paid well, and was wolked and managed in a satisfactory manner. He was surprised at the amount of traffic they had at various stations. He agreed to the principle of local parties making extension lines at their own cost, and the company working the traffic en them at a moderate cost. If they wanted mnore money they might issue their 5 per cent. stock to the shareholders, who would no doubt take it up. The general increase of traffic had been very satisfatory. They had now relaid nearly the whole of their line with new rails and fshjoints, with the exception of 12i miles; he wished to know the cost of it, and how long it was expected to last. He thought if it were substantially done the expense of renewals would soon be much diminished. With regard to the increase of capital, he hoped some plan would be devised which would render that unnecessary. He vwished to know whether the lines they proposed to lease were contractors' lines.
The CIIAInIss,t? said, they would not issue the 5 per cent. stock to the shareholders at less than 25 per cent. prerniam while they could borrow money at 4 per cent. The cost of relaying the line was from 1,0001. to 1,5004. per mile, the sleepers were creosoted at Is each, and the new rails were 751b. to the yard, being 61b. heavier than the old rails. The baUasting was also of a superior description to that originally laid down ; a considerable portion of the outlay was for improvmrnents which on other companies'lines would be chared to capital, but they paid the whole out of reve-
one. He believed that the renewals and sleepers would last 15 years. The propred lines were not contractors' lines; they were promoted byparties locally interested.
MEr. WOOD proposed that 14.6761. should be dedncted from the balance available for dividend, and that the latter
should be reduced from 3U per cent, for the half-year to 3} p n.,per cent. frtebfexW3
lr. BZLL, WaS anXious to see the West-end and Crystal Palace line opened to Sloane-street, and wi4hed to know when that event was to take place. He was eppocsed toworking only a portion of the line. With regard -to the: Oiction. of directors, lie had a great objection to the boardi filling uP vacancies without consulting the sbareholderas and hoped the chairman would give them a pledge thaLt ttue practice sbould he discontinued.
After some observations from Admiral Ielly, Mr._ Mawdsley, cnd Mr. Alston,
The CteArussx\ stated that he bad been assured that the, whole of tbe land for the West-end and Crystal Palace line. up to the Sloane-street station, had been secured, Thepor tion of the line now open had brought a considerable tralffl over that line to London-bridge, and liad paid them weit for working it. They were told that the line wonld be. completed at Midsummer next. With regard to the electiorn of directors, he thought they had better let it remain
Was. It might be very popular to elect directors as saug gested by Mr. Bell, but it mnst be remembered that a rail. way was a commercial undertaking, and it was necessarythat aU the managing partners should work harmoniouslr and assist each other in the various duties they had to. perform. HIe would ask them to look at the present, and ask themselves whether the directors were not more. competent to select a mnanaging partner from the share. holders than such a meeting earing in mind that there w,re, nearly 8,000 proprietors 'b ent and unrepresented? Thek directors did net want a managing partner to bring discorai to the board, as that would only tend to obstraccr the business of the company, anid produce no grod. whatever. He for one would have nothing to do. with a board that was not harmonious. Though the. board did not form itself into several committees, they had committees when re-quired, but they maintained the responsibility of the whole of the diretohrs for the manage.. i ment of the company's affairs. They had the South-Western. Bailway on their left and the South-Eastern Railway on their right, and he thought the proprietors could easily imagine. how essential it was they should have a united board working cordially together. The shareholders had the opportunity of rejecting directors wben they retired by rotation, and that, he thought, was sufficient. . `
The amendment proposed by Mr. Wood was then negatived by a large myaority.
The report was adopted, and a dividend of 31 per cent. for the half-year was declared payable on the bth of Feb. ruary.
TIe retiring directors and auditors were reelecte4
Mr. YOUNG proposed a resolution to the effect that systematic travelling on the Sabbath be discontinued over the. company's lines, which was negatived, Hle then proposed w reoution to the effect that the privileges of Saturday retumn-tickets be greatly enlarged, the timo extended, and faxes reduced; upon which an amenduient was carried leaving the matter in the hands of the directors.
Special meetings were then held, at which the reementsforworking the West-end of IodonandCrystalPalace line and leasing the Wimbledon and Croydon Railway' were sanctioned and confirmed.
On the motion of Mr. MAWIJSLEY the best thanks of themeeting were voted to the chairman and directors, and the, proce ags terminated.
LLA-tELLY.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday at the London Tavern, Mr. J. Biddulph in the chair.
Tho report Etated that the earmings of the half-year ending the 31st of December were nearly 18 per cent. in. advance of those of the corresponding period of the previous year.

The working charges showed an increase of 8701. over those, of the corresponding period of 185S. The main line was. now in thoroughly efficient condition. The Llandilo extension was opened for traffic on the 24th inst. The. capital account showed that 287,9011. had been expended, leaving a balance of 6,3641.

IA portion of the foUowing appearod in our second .bditiou of yesturdav :-1
PARTS, WEDNE;SDAY, JAN. 28, 6 P.M.
ThIe question (if 2euchatel is pretty much in the an,e state as when last I alluded to it. Dr. Kerni,
bho expects to be the Plenipotentiary from the ConIt de: ation, is still here. Neither the place nor the -date of holding the Conference is yet decided. The -hances were for some time in favour of London, but it appears that Lord Palmerston seems willing to 3 ield on this point to the French Government, and the chances are now said to be for Paris. We know nrithing officially of the conditions on which the liirg of Prussia will consent to renounce his claims *cn NeuchateL
Verger's appeal will come before the Court of Cassation to-morrow. It turns, as you are aware, -onl certain alleged informalities in the proceedings. For instance, the witnesses were sworn while the -axrmination of others or of the prisoner was goingr on, the counsel for the defence omitted to take note of the fact, and the clerk of the court drew up the minutes, not according to the proceedings as they were, but as they should be, conducted. These objections are of a purely technical nature, but it ii said some of the members are disposed to admit tbem. On this point, however, the less said the ibetter, as the question comes on to-morrow.
Verger asked to be allowed to attend mass in the prison chapel on Sunday last. As his demeanour ]iad beeq for some days calm and collected, no ob.,ectson v,waS made. During the service, however, his qmanner changed, and he became so violent that he had to be removed.
A deficit is said to be anticipated in the year's 'budget, and in order to obtain an equilibrium great reductions will probably take place in the military .and naval establishments. Reductions are demanded in the Ministerial departments, and, as might be expected, each Minister defends his own, but thinks that his respected colleague might with advantage be pared down to the quick. Then, again, the higher paid functionaries think the 4smaller salaries shonld be made " beautifully less ;" while the little bodies look up at the -oflicial giants, and believe that the reductions sheuld begin, and I suppose end, with them. There is no reason, they allege, why this or that Minister should receive a large salary, of which he spends not one-half: the other half might as well remain in the State coffers. The thought of reduction of salary produces a painful impression generally, but at this moment a perfectfrisson runs alono the whole chain work of officials. All are aware of the deficit, lament it, and admit the necessity of reduction; but each thinks that he himself should he spared, and that it is his friend and neighbour -who should be immolated for the public good. ;Some ingrates think that people should begin with the beginning, and that the Emperor himself ought to set the example. It is rumoured that some -daring persons have proposed in the Council of State that the Imperial Guard should be decimated, I mean, of course, in a financial sense. Others have suggested that one-half of that imposing and expensive corps should be discharged. The Imperial Guard is as yet hardly constituted, but if it were less by a moiety there would, it is affirmed, be a saving of 30,000,000f. I cannot say whether this unbandsome proposition will be acted upon.
The following interesting letter relative to thIe ;Roman Catholic Bishops of Ireland has been received from Rome:-
" The tardiness of the Propaganda in the settlement of Irish ecclesiastical questions of late years has, it seems occasioned some uneasiness and misgivings in Ireland. The 'somimation to bishopriclks, and the sanction and promulga. tion of the acts of the Synod of last June, constitute the late and present grievances. There is not a priest in Ire. land possessing the privilege of recommending candidates for the mitre who does not know that the Propaganda and is new Delegate desire to raise the qualifications of the Irish episcopacy, by introducing into that body men of business habits, young, energetic, willing and ready to co-operate in the reformation of the Irish priesthood and of the seminaries, and in the elevation of the moral and social character of the faithful. These reverend and troublesome electors are desirous of having venerable old gentlemen 'who love the status quo; and they continue to recommend them. This preference causes delay and eusbarrassment. 'The only radical remedy for the inconvenience and for the ,opposition and difficulties attending the changes of dio-ceses or other useful reforms is the establishment of diplomatic relations, and a Concordat like those that already exist between the Iloly See and all the Catholic and most -of the non-Catholic States of Europe. To secure this Concordat a few reasonable concessions may suffice just now,such as the recognition by all of a notorious unquestionable fact, that Ireland has Roman Catholic archbishops, bishops, and parish priests, a clarter for the Catholic University, and the overthrow of the monstrous Irish Church establishment, with a just partition of its wealth in the proportions of one. fonrth to the V oman Catholic clergy and church, one-eighth to all the other religious denominations, and the remaining five-eightlhs between the educational and charitable estaiblishments of the country. It is strange that the British -Government should have no direct influence, or public and
recognized part, in the nomination to positions of immense political inlluence over five or six millions of British subjects. I do not mean to insinuate that the Irish bisbops are -not loyal men and good subjects. Indeed, the rules and -regulations wbich they have endeavoured to give to certain ecclesiastical establishments prove singular respect and love for the British Constitution. But yet it is odd that posi. tions influencing the return of some 60 or S0 members of Parliament should be perfectly independent of the Government. Now- is the timie to do something. Dr. Cullen wil
not live always. His venerated predecessor, in whose stepi he is so worthily treading, did not carry his paramounit inluence with the Propaganda to the grave. Differences be tween the Irish bishops themselves on reUgio-political ques. -tions, and their effects on the people, would facilitate an amicable understanding between Rome and Dublin. Cardinal Wiseman will give no assistanco at present, but he %ill not be an insurmountable obstacle.
" The acts of the Synod of June have been maturely considered and discussed, and they, of course, like all similar productions, leave a great deal to be desired both in what ,they omit and what they contain; and in some important things expediency, it is said, has been overlooked by th-venerable framers. A report of Archbishop Cullen to th: Propaganda regarding the testimony of some Maynooth professors, as recorded in the late reports, has called forth a letter from the Cardinal Prefect, requiring one of these 2everend gentlemen to retract certain views. Dr. Cullen desired that, from respect for the Holy See, that letter and Ihe submission of the professor should be inserted in the minutes of the Synod. Some of the prelates were for taking no notice of the letter, on the ground of its being
surreptitious, and having been obtained on misrepresentations. At all events, a large majority agreed to its insertion in the minutes, adding, however, that it had proceeded from false inforu,iation. The matter might better have bEen omitted altogether than noticed with such an unpleasant comiiment, wvhich will hardly be found on the face of the approved copy.
" It was proposed that all the educational establishments in Ireland should be placed in relation with and subject t
the Catholic University. This excellent resolution was un. happily negatived. It cannot be that the bishops wanted -confidence in the new Pector. Must it, then, be concluded that they are unconvinced of the success of that admirable institution? Dublin itself has this year subscribed over :1,OOot. towards it. Although the faithful might be se nminded that they annually subscribed five times that sum to -the O'Connell Fund, without any cooperation or sanction of
their prelates, yet if even this sum be contributed every year it wiUl be one-fifth oi the entire annual revenue mequired by the Rector. The bishops, too, in their Synodal Jottcr, recommend collections and contributions for this establishment, and yet they do nothing. The bishops desire that there should be two perpetual secretaries of the
University, whose duty would be to correspond with all bishops, priests, and others who may contribute to its support. Some would fain insinuato that a regulation of the kind would give anibrage to the Governmont, but such an objection is inconsistent with the liberties of the constitation.
" The manner in which the rescriptsregarding theQueen's Colleges, the charitable bequests, the political extravagances of the priests are received, and the hostility the majority <.f the prelates are, known to entertain to the views of the Apostolic Delega0srespecting the national seminaries do not tend to expedite 1Iish affairs in this city. It is singular, considering the almost total inattention of the Irish *bishops to Maynooth until Dr. Cullen came among them
t iat they would not give up tho direction of that establist. ment, which is capable ef being made so important, to an active and pious prelate who is ever at hand, and who is, noseover, its immediate ecclesiastical suPerior- This is not all. When the Propaganda offered, in December, 1855, to relieve them from the trouble of directing the Irish collego in Parix, the proposition was hardly listened to by some of them ! It is rumoured here that the French Government lave ieleased the Irish prelates from the obligation they
took uponthemselves, amid the troubles of the Republic with regard to the respectable old College des Irlandais. The College of St. Agatha has seldom been more flourishing than at this noiuent. Now, would it not be much better for the Irish Catholic Church to have all the other seminaties modelled on this, which is working so successfully? It will, no doubt, come to pass in due tiie. The four arch bishops possess a fair share of authority over St. Agatha
there would be no objection to their having the samc over Maynooth; and, after all, what can the Irish bishops want but good, pious, and docile priests?
" You may rest assured that an end will soon be put to someof the cryinzg evils of Ireland. Religion and patriotism oblige certain Irish prelates to push their advocacy of their own crotchets beyond all bounds, to the pain and scandal of every respectable Catholic, and these prelates unfortunately are applauided by the unreflecting and excitable part of the people and by a majority of the thoughtless clergy. If a relation or friend of Dr. Cullen denounce and turn into ridicule these I humbugs' the Apostolic Delegate and poor Cardinal Barnabo in particalar are declared to be the sworn enemies of Ireland ! We are also reminded of the long past aud long forgotten interference of Rome in certaia Irish questions. But these Mentors forget that times, men, and questiois have changed. Let any calm Englishman ask himself whether a prelate who has taken a prominent part in all the political conflicts of Ireland for the last 20 years can bring a cooler head and a more unbiassed judgment to questions involving the beat interests of the Irish Church and people than a man who has been a stranger to that agitation and that excitement, and to the faction struggles which so long and so unhappily distracted Ire. land."
One word as to the rumour about the French Government having withdrawn the Irish College in Paris from the control of the Irish bishops. A rumour to that effect has certainly been ptit into circulation in Paris. I believe it, however, to be completely unfounded. It has in all probability been got up to promote some intrigue.
Recent advices from the Danubian provinces announce that, in pirsuance of orders received from St. Petersburg, the Russiau authorities are to quit Bolgrad the 1st of February next, to occupy Kicheneff, the chief town of the province of Bessarabia. No Russian will remain in the town except the secretary appointed to surrender it oflicially to the Moldavian authorities.
The interesting work of M. talon, clerk at the debtors' prison, has directed the attention of the public to the provisional arrest of foreigners in F'rance. It must be admitted that a law which pormits arrest under such circumstances is inconsistent with the civilization of the age. One can understand the arrest of an individual at the risk and peril of the person who demands his incarceration, but the arrest of a man without the slightest responsibility attaching to the party who effects it, but simply because the arrested is a foreigner, places the respective countries in an unjust inequality, and is a disgrace to that in which it takes place. A case has just occurred, where a respectable foreigner resident in Paris, who bad even distinguished himself in the ranks of the French
rnmy, and is decorated by the Emperor, has been a victim to this vicious system. He had invested money in an industrial undertaking in which he was engaged, but refused to advance any more to the same company because it had not been legally founded. He was summoned before the Tribumal de Commerce, who decided that he should continue his payments. Before the decision of the Court was communicated to him his adversary obtained his provisional arrest, and he was obliged to remain in prison for three weeks before he could get a copy of thejudgment. WVhen he did procure the paper he at once appealed. The Cour lmperial rendered him prompt justice, annulled the judgments of the Tribunal de Commerce, and ordered him to be at once set at liberty, but without giving him any compensation for the wrong he had suffered. Here, then, is a person who, simply because he is a foreigner, has been deprived of his liberty for three weeks, and obtains no reparation for loss of time and liberty. Perhaps it was owing only to accident that during his sojourn at Clichy he also, as well as the unfortunate American who was contined there, was not the victim of the homicide which, it is fair to admit, none regret more than the French Government.
With respect to its internal arrangements, the debtors' prison of Clichy has not, I am assured, participated in the improvements of the age. No distinction is made between those who are definitively confined there and those who are only provisionally detained. As the former are treated with little regard, the condition of the latter is still more humiliating, as they are often lodged within its walls on unjust grountds, and leave it, acquitted, after a detention of six months. The internal organization is described by those who have witnessed it as very had, and for those wlho have the misfortune to fall ill during detention deplorable. It is said there is hardly a prison is France worse cared for in the latter respect. There is, it appears, nothing that ean be called an infirmary, nor, except the medical oflicer, any proper attendants. The establishment is most uucleass ; a few of the cells are rather good, but others are not better than dungeons. On the -whole, both the law of provisional arrest and the organization of the prison itself merit the attention of the Emperor ai.d his Government. The law is one of the legacies left by the Governmient of July, the law of provisional arrest having renmained abolished, I believe, from 1807 to 1ti62. It is clear that a foreigner cannot murmur if lie is placed on an equal footiug -with French citizens, but he has grounds for complaint if the law permits him, for instance, to be imprisoned for]O yeas-s for (,OOOf., vwhile a Frenchman cannot be incarcerated for a longer term than three years for the same a-mount, not to speak of provisional si-rest for so small a sum as 1500£, or 61., and which may result from an erroneous account.
Air. Kelley, the American engineer, whose plan for cutting a ship canal across the Isthmus of I-'anama, without locks, has been already noticed, had an audience yesterday of the Emperor. His MIajesty expressed himself pleased with what had been done towards reducing this great undertaking to what the engineer believes to be a practicable and tangible shape.

VIENNA, JAN. 26.
At half-past 11 o'clock last night the following official intelligence was forwarded to you by electric telegraph MM AN, JAN. 25.
"A general and complete amnesty has been granted for the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom. All persons sentenced for political offences have been liberated. All the political piocesses which were pending have been quashed. The Special CriminalCoCurtat Mantua hasbeen dissolved. General rejoicing."
By the Imperial rescript of the 25th of January a full and unconditional pardon has been granted to two distinct classes of political offenders. The first dls's comprises those persons who, having been tried and condemned for high treason and other political offences, were under punishment, and also the fugitives who were sentenced to death or imprisonment in contumzacians. The second class consists of those persons who, baving been arrested for political offences, had not
been brought to trial. The dissolution of the 8pecial Criminal Court, which held its sittings at
lantua, will not fail to produce au excellent mipression on the inhabitants of the Lombardo-Veneian kingdom. The tribunal in question, which was as odious to the Italians as was the Star Chamber to the subjects of Ris Majesty King Charles I. of England, was not a court-martial in the strict sense of the expression; but military judges, called auditeres, were attached to it, and it rarely or never happened that a person accused of treasonable practices was discharged because his. innocence was proved. If a prisoner was liberated, it was because his guilt was " not proven" (ab instantid). The dissolution of the special court at Mantua is a proof that the Emperor is resolvedtotry whether hisltaliausubjects may not be governed with the sceptre instead of the sword, and it will probably be their own fault if he again has recourse to harsh measures. It is evident that the intentions of the Sovereign and of his official advisers are good, but it is greatly to be feared that the favourable impression which the recent measures have produced will be weakened by the want of tact of the inferior authorities. It would not be advisable to hold the reins of Government loosely, but every measure which could needlessly woundthe pride or give umbrage to the Italians otught to be carefully avoided. The Lombards and Venetians are extremely proud of their mother tongue and of its literature, and this Cabinet will do well to remember that it is extremely dangerous to attempt to force a foreign language on a nation. Had not the Magyais endeavoured to make the Croats and Slavonians speak Hungarian at the Diet the political position of Hungary would be very different from what it is at present. As irascible natures can be excited by things which produce but little impression on persons of a more phlegmatic temperament, it would be good policy also to simplify the police syatem in the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom. A cold-blooded German wrill wait patiently until he can procure a permission to travel 30 or 40 English miles by railroad, buc the fiery italian furnes and frets whenever he is obliged to apply for a piece of paper which will enable him to proceed from his native place to the next town or village. A person of rank, who long served the State in Lombardy, has repeatedly assured me that by far the greater number of the so-called political offences of the Italians were neither more nor less than violent outbreaks of impatience and passion caused by the vexatious measures of the executive authorities. In order that there might be no mistake, inquiry was made in the proper quarter whether the persons who had been condeuned in contumaciam would be molested by the police if they returned to Austria, and the reply received was in the negative.
The following is the letter of the Emperor Francis Joseph to Marshal Radetzky, announcing a general amnesty to all political prisoners in the LombardoVenetian provinces. It is dated Milan, January the 25th:-
" Dear Field marshal Count Radetzky,-I decido by way of favour (trovo in via di graria) to releas all persons belonging to the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom now imprisoned for the crimes of high treason, disturbance of public tranquillity, revolt and insurrection, from the entire punishment to which they have been sentenced, and to command that they shall be immediately set at liberty. At the same time I determine to annul all the proceedings pending in the Lombardo-Venetian k-ingdom for the above-mentioned crimes, oommanding the release from prison of the persons detained for thoso causes. The special court existing at Mantua ceases from this moment, and ifs functions shall be at an end."
It is probable that the conference for settling the future relations between Neuchatel and Prussia will be held at Paris, and it is perhaps quite as well that it should be so. Louis Napoleon took the trouble to prepare the pill for the King of Prussia, and it is bat just that he should adnminister it. At a sitting held by the Bund on Thursday, the 22d, M. von Bismark, the representative of Pnusia, informed the august assembly that, as Switzerland had unconditionally liberated the prisoners, His Majesty the King would negotiate " inthe same spirit ofreconciliation as before." At the same time M. von Bismark thanked the Confederation, and particularly the separate Governments, " for the good federal feeling which they had manifested in the matter of the march of Prussian troops through their territories." The F2-anLfo t Journal has an article " from Southern Germany," in which the writer attempts to prove that Austriawwas wrong when she questioned the right of Baden, Wurtemberg, and Bavaria to permit Prussian troops to march through their territories. Now, the Imperial Government did not deny the "right" of the three German potentates to permit Prussian troops to pass through their States, but it questioned the propriety of their so doing. The violent hostility displayed by the Sardinian press to the Emperor Francis Joseph greatly excites the Austrian Government and the army, and it would perhaps be well if the British Government counseed CountCavournot to push matters too far. The opinion of a newspaper correspondent is naturally of little weight, but it appears to me that it ought to be the policy of the British Government to bring about a reconciliation between Austria and Sardinia, and to establish a better understanding between Austria and Prussia. W17hen, months and years ago, it was said in my correspondence that an alliance mutst eventually be formed between Austria and England the assertion found favour neither here nor at home, but the opinions of the Austrians have recently undergone a great change, and they now, with few exceptions, consider an intimate alliance between England, Germany, ancl Austria absolutely necessary to the welfare and even to the safety of Europe. As you have already been informed, this Government is desirous that the Kilia arm of the Danube should be used instead of the Sulina; but it does not follow as a matter of course that it considers the Kilia preferable to the St. Georae's arm of the river. Long experience has taught Austria that Russia must be watched -without ceasing, and she fears that if the most southerly arm of the Danube were used the Russians would manage to get a footing again in the more northerly part of the Delta. The Danubian (ritcraine) Commission assembled in this city holds two sittings a-week, but the public is in total ignorance of what passes.

To The Editor Of The Times.
TO THE BDITOR OF THE TIIMUS.
Sir,-Seeing in The Times of this day that the artisans mechanics, and labourers bave formed a society for the p)rU pose of facilitating emigration, and that they solicit from your readers communications on the subject, I take the liberty of offering a few suggestions.
Could not these men form clubs for emigration somewhat on the principle of land ¢lubs?
Suppose clubs were formed of 100 shares each.
Let a man with a wife and five children take one share for each adult and half a share for each child.
Let him pay Gd. per week, more or less, as might be con. sidered best, on each shiare; or clubs could be formed at 3d., Gd., and ls.
Say that it would cost 101. to land each emigrant in Canada West. As soon as funds were on hand, let the shareholders ballot to see who should go first.
Let the successful candidate give security for the repavment of the stm loaned, and at least 25 or n0 per cent, advance for the privilege, to be paid at the rate of 10s. per month to an agent in Canada, commencing the payments three months from bis arrival in the country. The overpsyments on the part of those who have gone out will, of course, hasten the departure of those who remain.
There would be much to consider and regulate in such a club, so as to equalize the benefits; I merely suggest this as the principle.
Aid might be solicited for the clubs from the Government einigratioa agents and other sources, and contracts made for cheap passage by a number of clubs combining.
One secretary could manage almost any numbur of clubs, sO that the expense need not be great.
As far as the prospects of emigrants are concerned, I ushla1 be most happy to supply the committee with any information in my powfer; and, having employed a great deal of labour in that country for many years past, I have a good opportunity of speaking from exnerience.

Frightful Tragedy In Her Majesty's 40th
FxIC4HTFuL TRAGEDY D- HER MAJESTY'S 40TEREGInExT.-We have received helbounme papersto the 31st of October, and we regret that on this occasion the prominent topic is not the gold or the advancing prosperity of the colony, but an incident which has occurred in Her Majesty's 40th Regiment. The circumstances of the tragedy are these:-EHs Excexency the Acting Governor held the usual half-yearly inspection of the troops in garrison yesterday at the Prince's-bridge Barracks, when tho 40th Regi. inent was paraded and went through various evolutions The inspection being over, the officers retired to their quarters, and Ensign Pennefather, with others, engaged in familiar and friendly conversation. Shortly afterwards, between 12 and 1 o'clock, Ensign Pennefather rushed out of his room with a six-barrelled revolver in his hand, and meeting, just as he got outside of the house, Ensign Keith, be presented the pistol and fired at him. The ball passed through Ensign Keith's cheek, and came out at the back of the neck. At this time Dr. M'Cauley was seated in an armehair on the grass in front of his quarters reading. In consequence of the accident which he met with a few weeks since by falling from the gallery upon the vestibule of the theatre Royal, the Doctor *vas an invalid, and his crutch lay by his side. After firing at Ensign IKeith, Pennefather ran to where Dr. MI'Cauley was sitting, and, placing the pistol on the Doctor's mouth. he fired, and the hail passed out at the back of his neck. Pennefather then looked round as if anxious to find some one else to shoot, when Ensi n Lucas ran forward to wrest the pistol from him. Oa seeing him approach Pennefather fired, and shot him in in the jaw. With a maniacal "Ha, ha!" the wretched man then placed the pistol to his own head and fired, the ball entering his right temple. Such, as near as we can learn, are the brief but shocking incidents of this distressing affair. Dr. IWCauley is dead. Several persons ran to him immediately after he was shot; he was still sitting in his chair, but life was extinct. Ensign Lucas is severely and Ensign Keith dangerouslv wounded, but bath are expected to recover. Of Ensign Pennefather there is no hope. By making incisions the ball and piece of skull have been =enoved, but the injuries are of too serious a nature to allow of a belief that the unfortunate cause of the tragedy can survive. The commission of so frightful an act can only be attributed to a fit of insanity. For the last three weeks Ensign Pennefather had been on the sick list, and it was generally believed that his mind was affected. Only a few days since Dr. 'Cauley is reported to have said to Pennefather, in a half-joking way, that if he didn't mend he should have to send him to the Yarra Bend. Whether the frenzy was provoked by any temporary cause we have not been able to ascertain, but, in the absence of any snch, the fit was probably owing to the sudden change in the weather and the excitement of the review. As might be anticipated, the wretclied maniac has since died; and an inquest has been held on the bodies of Dr. MI'Cauley and Ensign Pennefather. The evidence was conclusive as to the insanity of the poor young man.
THE COaLLNS A-ND CUijARD SrBAmERs.-The tables published in the Neow York Herald on the 1st inst., exhibiting " the time occupied in mAking the eastern and western passages dnring the past vear of the Collins and Cunard lines of the New York and Liverpool steamships," give the following results:-
sy nen oe U0ollins steamers were first brought into com ne. tition with the Cunardera the latter were comparatively small, being about 1,800 tons burdens, while the former were over 3,000 tons. Experience proves that a greater speed Can be got from a large steamship than from a small one, other thingsbeing equal. Latterly, however, there has been a nearer approach to equality in size, the new ships built for the Cunard line being larger than the old ones. At one time the Collins steamers were run at full speed, 'whereby great loss was sustained by the owners. There was extra consunmption of coal, and consequently less room for freight than there ought to have been, and the wear and tear of the machinerywerefarabove anything like a fair average. The Collins Company, therefore, snade little or no profit, while the Cunard Company, by pur3uing a more business like course, was able to make satisfactory dividends. An Admiralty regulation prescribed the pressure of steam to be allowed in the British vessels hut the American vessels were wholly unrestrained in that particular. The great object of the captains of the Collins steamers was to beat the British, especially on the voyages from Liverpool to New Tork. The national vanity was excited, and Mr. Collins and his associates every now and then appeared before Congrems for an addition to the amount which the Government had agreed to pay him for the carriage of the mails. The princIpal ground for this applcation was that the ships had been buil of a larger size than the British in order to beat them. It was assumed that the national honour was involved in the contest, and as the ships were larger and more costly than they should have been, having regard to mere mercantile considerations, the representatives of the nation were called upon to "foot the hill," which was a pretty large one, the rate of charge being about double that allowed by the British Governmcnt ta the Cunard Company. Congress has paid up for a long time, but is now getting tired of it. The result is, that the artificial stimulus being withdrawn, the Collins steamers are now run with more regard to economy and safety; they are consequently finding their true level, and tbeir actual iafenority to the Brtish can no longer be dQAbted.c-)..

TilE SITE OF THE LATE S351THFIELD-.MARtET.
bMr. Alderman Co'ELA.ND asked the Chairman of tho Markets Improvemnent Committee whether he was in parsession of any communication recently received from the Government with reference to the site of Smithfieldmarket?
Mr. H. L. TAYLOR.-Since we ast metI have learnt that acommunication was then in the hands of the Remembrancer which I was not aware of. A letter has been received from the Lords of the Treasury, disagreeing with the proposition made by the committee as to the appropriation of the site of Smithfield, but asking if the corporation had any other plan to suggest, and expressing their willingness to hear wbat we had to say upon the subject. That letter is about to be, if it has not already been, answered by the Remembrancer. This wil put the committee in further communication with the Lords of the Treasury, and we shall take the earliest opportunity of communicating with the Court as soon as anythingfurther transpires.
Mr. H. W. V.ALLANCE.-I think we ought to understand the effect of the reference to that committee. We may get into a difficulty if that committee is to be empowered to communicate with Government respecting the disposal of sites of land belonginig to the corporation, without informlag the Court of their proceedings.
The LoitD MiYOIt intimated to Mr. Vallance that the Court had been called for a special purpose-namely, the election of a Common Serjeant, and that as a question had been put and answered, any discussion upon the subject to which it related must be reserved for a future occasion.

The LoRiD MAYOIt having formally announced tho result of the election,-
Mr. CILAstIsEgis said-M[y Lord Mayor, Mr. Recorder, and gentlemen, the announcement which you have just made from the chair casts upon me the first duty which I shall discharge in the honoarable position in which your favour has placed me-a duty as peremptory and even uiore pleas. tng than that long series of functions which in the service of the city of London I hope to have the pleasure and the honour of fulflling. In returning to this
Court, through you, my Lord Mayor, my thanks for the I honourable position in which you have placed me by the vote of this morning, I cannot but be sensible that thero is no langnage of mine wlhich can adequately describe the obligation under which I feel myself placed by the frank and cordial kindness of my friends, who have won for me, against the honourable rivalry of eminent men of my own profession, a judicial office of which any meniber of that profession might he proud. (Cheers.) And while I enter upon the discharge of those duties which wvill now devolve on me with a high sense of the honour which has been conferred upon me in assigning that office to me, I shal enter upon the discharge of its duties with a deep sense of the magnitude of the responsibility involved in the trust thus placed in me. (Hear, hear.) I shall succeed in this office many eminent, and some illustrious mei, wvhose examiple in the discharge o f official duties it wiU be my ambition to emulate. I shail disebarge those duties in the presence of a cloud of witnesses to whom I shall onie double allegiance-thie allegiance which every judge owes to every inhahitant of this country, faithfuUy, patiently. intelligently, and impartially to adininisterjustice. and the allegiance under which you have placed me by the vote this morning, and by the kind and zealous exertions in which that votp issued and in wvhich it has found its reward. (Cheers.) I beg leave once again, my Lord Mayor, to offer mny sincerc and humble thanks to tie members of this Court for the distinguished honour which they have conferred upon me, and to express a hope that dedicating such abilities as I possess, and such knowledge of my profession as I possess, arid such health and stlength as God has given me, to the service of the corporation of L^ndon in thrs important post, I shall never in a single instance, in the whole course of my judicial carcer, be guilty of anything which can raise even a momentary blush upon the brow of aniyman who has assisted me in attaiing4this distinguibhed and honourable office. (Cheers.)
Sir . RIDDELL,-My Lord Maycr, Mr. Recorder, and Gentlemen,-I most gladly avail myself of the opportunity of expressing my sincere and heartfelt thanks to this Court for the courtesy I have met from it at all times since I have had the honour of the acquaintance of any of its members. Your Lordship will not expect or desire from a defeated candidate any remnarks at any length upoit an occasion like the present; but I do feel this, that altbough defeated upon the present occasion, and by a most worthy and honourablc
competitor and respected friend of my own, I have no occasmon to feel disgraced. (Hcar, hear.) I was unques-
tionably anxious to cbtain, if it should be the will of thin Court. tle lionourable and independent office of Common ,Serjearnt of the city of London, nnd I was justified in seeking that office, at all events, by the example of tne nunruesru, and learned, and able competitors wvho, upon the present as well as upon the former occasions, have sought it. It has been your pleasure to con. fer it upon another, after a contest perhaps ono of the most furiouly excited tat the annals of clections in this citv have produced-I mean as to the closeness of the numbers which placed my friend Mr. Chambers and myself so frequently upon a level during the election. I have only. now again to repeat my most sincere thanks to you all-to those who havo assisted me in this matter, and who have spared no labour or pains to insure my success. (Cheers,) I feel that words are not eufficient to express my gratitude towards them. I thank them most sincerely, and I thank all the members of the Court for the courtesy and kindness which I have received at their hands during this cointest. (Cheers.) I feel that there are no members here who have voted out of oppositi(n to me,
but they have given a fair and honourahle preference to my comnpetitor. I bid farewell to tho Court with many tbhnks. (Cheers.)
The Court then addourned.

The Future Of Cotton.
THE FUTURE OF COTO2.
(From the New Orleans Delta.)
The future of cottou ! It is impossible to conceive the, full force, and scope, and sweep of these fow words. The mit d ic not so wide as to grasp the actual power, or so far-reaching as to compass tho possibilities of cotton, the deoninion of which sWells grandly into all the lime tD come. It is true, commerce is called "KingJ' but cotton confers the crown and sceptre, and is the power behind the throne greater than tho throne itself. This relation it cOr always maintain if it is true to itself, Its mninisters should be as circumspect as bold, as energetic as prescient. Its great army in the South shouald not be prmitted to diminish, but should bo enlarged pari passu, as now fields of conquest aro opened.
But if the proseat power of cotton is great, and its future possibilities still greater, there are numerous adverse influ ences also that threaten to subvert its empire and make its grandeur a thing that was. These influences are mainly,. if not entirely, political in their origin, and, strange to say, ars not directed against the cotton interest of tho United States from a foreign source alone, but have their root even in the Federal constitution, and are not witbhout nurture even in the South. The Federal influences to which we refer flowmainly from two restrictions-one upon the cotton trade in the guise of the tariff, and the other upon cotton production in the shape of the act of Congress, prohibiting the introduction of black labourers required in cultivAtion 'of cotton according to the law of supply and demand. Wo propose to consider the latter prohibition only in connexion with the futare of cotton, and its commercial and political relations. The unjust exactions of the former are too wdll known by every intelligent Southerner to require argument here. Let us look at facts and figures.
From 1845 to 1855 the average rate of increase as regards the production of cotton was about 9 per eent. per annum (so sound statistical authority informs us), and as regards consumption about 16 per cent. If these ratios continue for the next ten years-that i,from 1855 to 1865, accotdiug to the same authority there wilclbda averagea annial deficir of about 476,000 bales. We oee in ten years that the increasing demand, at the above rates, will call for a total i- crease of 160 per cent. in the production, of which the latter will furnish only 90 per cent. How is this disparity to be overcome-a disparity that will bh attended by the most serious calamities to the commercial and industrial elasses, nnless counteracted by a commensurate increase in the production of cotton, or the subotitution of some equivalent in trade and manufacturo ? We are told that the East India experiment of England in the culture of cotton is a failure, and that the Africau experiment of. France will be equally unsuccessftl. We are told that of the four millions and odd bales of cotton produoed in the world our Southern cotton-growing States furnish over three-fourths and that this ratio they can not only maintain but increase in future. We are told that of 400,000,000 acres of our cotton lands only 28,000,000 are in cultivation ; and tlat of 3,500,000 slaves only about one-sixth are employed in producing cotton. Let us look at facts and figures again.
We have an abundance of land, it is true, but land is nothing without suitable labour. Have 've a ufficiency of such 1abour in the South? We will see.' It is not trm
that but one-sixth of the slaves are employed in the cultivation of cotton. Tho number of slaves in the South actually qualified for field work is not more, probably, than 1,600,000, and more than ono-third ot those are already eilployed in cultivating cotton, SUppose, under the stimulus of hig prices, the diversion of slave labour from other branches of agriculture is sufficient te enable the production to keep pace with the demand-that is, to increase at the rate of 16 per cent. per annum-in 10 years, or 12 at least, allowing the natural incroase of slavery to be 3 per cent, per annum, all the avaiable slave labour in the South would be exhausted. What then? The increaso in production would be arrested, but tho inereasing demand would continue. And what after this ? A great problem would be presented, and on its solution would depend not only the future of cotton but the fate, political and commercial, of the South.
Naturo is bountiful And provident. Her vegetable riches and agricultural resources aro not exhausted, if, indeed, they are exhaustible. Man is ingenious, nocessity makes him inventive. If cotton faUs to supply the wants of comn merce and feed the mUlions who subsist by manufactures, then the earth will be ransacked through all its recesses. Art wiU toUl night and day, science will keep ceaseless watch, untl the deficit of cotton is restored or an equivalent staple is discovered. The project of restraining the production of cotton within a given limit, in order to control thle price at a very high standard, if seriously conceived and attempted, would defeat itself.
* But what would be the political effect of the concentration of the slave labour of the South, or the available portion of it, on cotton, in order to keep pace with the demand for 10 or 12 years? It 'would withdraw the most valuable slaves fromaMaryland, Virginia, Kentucky, fissouri, aaid, finally, Tennessee, and compress the great body of the slave population within a circumscribed area, where cotton could be grown most profitably, and with the easiest access to market. A non-slaveholding population of Northern labourers would come in to take the places of the slaves withdrawn from the States mentioned; tho Black Republicai cancer would eat still further into their borders, penetrate to their centre;, and ultimately spread fronv centre to circumference. Those States would virtually cease to be Southern. The political strength of the South 'would be reduced nearly half. She would have to give up aU hope of securing a balance of power in the Union. Slavery, instead of being diffaued in many hands, would be confined to still fewer than at present, and the cordon of an opposing nonslaveholding element would be constantly narrowing around it. The same causes that would deplete the border Slave States would alsso prevent the expansion of slavery into newterritory. Thefortunesof theinstitutionvrould bestaked on one article of agrculture. The limit of production would be reached at last. The diversion of commerce and manufacture to other sources, or to some equivalent of cotton, would inevitably be made. The dream of a great cotton monopoly, the vision of the autocratic cottoh bale, would pass; the political power of the South would be gono ; hei commercial grandeur would be no more; like the glory of Babylon, all would vanish in the 'wind. The South might at last awake to the rninous policy she had been pursuing, but it 'would then be too late-" too late I" the eternal sentence written down by Fate against fools and slug-
May Heaven forefend such 'a disastrous consummation I But what is to prevent it? We know of notbing that carn avert the final calamity if the policy of limitation and concentration which we sketched be persisted in. The Black Republican cancer on the borders and theunnatural congestion in the contro must at last do their work. Paralysis wiU follow spasm ; the death rattle will soon be heard -and then an end !
But let the principle of free trade apply to the labour system of the South; let its employment, its direction, its growth, be governed by the law of supply and demand. Let it no longer be stigmatized as piracy to maintain slavery by the same means which originated it. Let that opprobrious brand be taken from the brow of the South. Let the sentimental humbhiggery of Albert Pike and such like be scouted into ridicule, and let rationalism and true philanthropy be respected. Let us hear no more of the heinous immorality of importing slaves from Africa, where their lives as well as their labour belong to their masters, and they are decimatedas often as the yani crop fails - nor of the perfect morality and legitimacy of purchasing tLem inVirginia,where theyare highly improved, and comfortable, and protected by humane laws, and transferring them to a condition which is less calculated to improve or to reuder happy. The King of Dahoniey is a cruel and often sanguinary master, and it is an absoluto blessing to his slaves when they are purchased by white owners; hut Governor Wise is a chivalrous gentleman and a lenient master, and we doubt much if one of his black servants could find his position bettered by any transfer.
Let such be the programme for the South to work out in. future, and if wisely and boldly pursued we may feel. assured of her destiny in all its fuluess. Her cornucopia will never fail; her might wiU never pass like the glory of Babylon, She will not sit forsaken amid the ruins of hermagnificence, with none so poor to do her reverence. Defended on both flanks, fortified at every point of attack, the
institution of slavery diffused as a vital element over all her, territory, shc will be politically invincible; she may sit under her owvn fig tree, waith none to make hler afraid; and, the production of cotton keeping pace 'with the deroand, the sepetre'will not pass from the cotton king while there is at Southern soil to be tilled, labour to till it, and inteUligence to direct the labour.

London, Friday, January 30, 1857.
LONDON, FRIDAY. JANUARY 30, 1857.
By the overland mail we have full details of the capture of Bushire. A Bombay Gazette Extraordi nary gives the official despatches of MajorGeneral STALKER and Sir HENRY LEE}E. Our correspondent furnishes from his ov,n information a minute account of the first success of the expedition. The whole forms a very gratifying narrative, and one 'which will confirm the public in their high opinion of Indian military management. We could wish that the commanders themselves gave a miore clear notion of the operations that took place; but Sir HEuNRY LEEKE fought so well that we feel unwilling to criticize his descriptive powers, although in its inconsecutiveness his language sometimes approaches the later Crimean despatches. However, it is possible to gain a sufficient insight into a series of prompt and brilliant movemlents. On November 29 the British fleet appeared off the town of Bushire. The Resident, Captain JoN Es, in reply to a demand for explanation from the GovERNoR, sent fron on board the Amsaye the proclamation of war, and a notification that his mission had ceased. On December 4 the island of Karrack was occupied by two companies of the 2d Beloochees. This small island lies about 30 miles to the north-west of Bushire, and is valuable chiefly for the supply of water which it affords. On the 6th the fleet with the transports dropped dowrn to Halilla-bay, 12 miles to the southeast of Bushire. From this place a gentle ascent leads to the town, and the necessity of surmounting a difficult cliff is avoided. On the morning of the 7th the debarcation commenced. The enemy were discovered in a date grove, ready to oppose the land-ng, but Sir H. LEEKE opened fire with his gunboat', and the irregular Persian levy retired. The General gives no particulars about the landiDg of the troops, and the Admiral does not tell us that they landed at all. We learn, however, that the operation required more than two days, but was effected by the boats of the fleet with success and withouit loss of life,
On the morning of the 9th the force commenced its march against the fort of Reshire, which stands at an angle of the promontory on which the town of Busbire is built. The first brigade, iunder Colonel STOPPOBD, was on the right, or inland; the second, under Colonel HOSN2ER, was on the left, with its own left towards the sea. The steamers moved along the coast to support the advancing army. The Admiral says, " It was supposed, from information we "received, that the enemy, in number fron..
1,500 to 2,000, would receive our troops, and "mal;e a powerful resistance. On my nearing " the fort th:s information was confirmed, and
we saw it perfectly full of Persian soldiers, who were drawn up ready for the attack. At this "moment I was about 1,700 yards from them, "when we commenced firing shell; many dropping "within the trenches and committing much
slaughter compelled the Persian troops to fly, "with the exception of 800, who made a resolute stand, and were driven out by the troops in one of the most brilliant and gallant charges "I ever witnessed." In this assault Brigadier SOPIFORD fell. He was shot through the heart while leading on his own regiment, the 64th, in the rush at the works. The 20th Native Infantry worthily rivalled the deeds of their European comrades. WVe trust, indeed, that the well trained Asiatic troops in the British service need fear no opponents that either Persia or her supposed ally is capable of sending against thera. Colonel MALET was shot by a treacherous enemy whose life he had saved. Lieutenants 1UTTERsox and WnAVERBx, of the 20th, were mortally wounded, one other officer severely, and the loss of the force besides was 6 kiUed and 35 wounded. Thus was the covering fort of Reshire
taken, and its garriion of 17500 to 2,000 men completely disperead.
The next step, of course, was to advance on Bushire itself, some four or five miles distant. Captain Jones was sent with a flag of truce, which was fired upon from the town, although the act was shortly afterwards apologized for. A delay of 24 hours was asked for by the Persians, and refused. The anchorage was buoyed during the night, and on the 10th the attack of the sea front commenced, the steamers moving in much nearer than the enemy expected. The engagement lasted four hours, at the end of which time the Persian batteries had nearly ceased firing. The Admiral, it appears, then determined to make an opening in the waU of the town, by which the army might advance, if necessary, to the assault. This was successfully effected, the fire from the enemy's batteries then slackened, the flagstaff in the town was cut down, and the place surrendered. Thus Bushire proper was really taken by a naval attack. The fleet stood in until it neared the defences, and did not think it necessary to preserve the respectful distances customary in the Baltic annd the Black Sea. The land force was cantoned on the plain, near the wells; the town was proclaimed British territory and a free port. Such is the summary of the first operations in the Persian war.
We have said. that these details will not fail to be satisfactory to the public. Indeed, the whole expedition appears to have been well planned and admirably carried out. Nearly 6,000 men, with everything necessary to their support, and a large force of steamers were collectedand despatched with singular promptness. It is stated that there are 7,000 more ready to follow, and that stiU larger reinforcements wiUl proceed if necessary to the seat of war. Defore Bushire the fleet and army co-operated with perfect success. In the attack on fort Reshire the fire of the steamers drcve two-thirds of the garrison from their guns and allowed the assault to be made with comparatively a small loss. At Bushire the garrison was forced to yield from the fire of the fleet, and the place, which the despatches tell us was much stronger than was expected, surrendered without causing a single casualty to the land or sea forces. The operations exhibit the easy triumph of scientific warfare over semi-barbarous troops. By the skill with which the conunanders made use of their advantages they have gained possession of the principal port of the Persian empire, and established a base for future operations at a less loss than is usually attendant on the pettiest skirmish of a campaign.

Queen MAB has been tickling the brains of
Queen MAB has been tickling the brains of some American A1YASCHAR, and the result is a dream of cotton. " We are fairly beat with "prosperity. All the world is at us for cotton; " 16 per cent. more every year than the " last. Yet we can't grow it fast enough;
only 9 per cent. more each year. If " this goes on, as it is sure to do, that's " 47G,000 bales wanted every year more thaa "we can manage. In ten years, if we flog the "fellows ever so hard, we can't even double "the crop, and the world wil want,-going on to "three tines as much. It is a positive sin to turn " away such a customer from one's door, and send " the whole earth a-begging. Let's see wlhat can " be done. Ies true we can take away the niggers " from Maryland, and Virginia, and Kentucky, " and Missouri, and Tennessee, and by that " means we may double our cotton hands. But "doubling won't aiswer the purpose more than " 10 years, for then it wiU want trebling. Be"sides, by the time we have shut up the tobacco, "and sugar, and coffee, and rice growers, and re"duced all the Southern States but our own "to deserts, we shall find the South look"ing very small, and the Yankees will "be right in among us. That will never do. " NVe can't afford to lose an inch of our ground, " and must not anyhow. So, wlhat's to be "done? Why, to be sure, we must do what others "do. In the North, when they want hands, they "get shoals of them Irish fellows. Why mayn't
we import our labourers as fast as we want " them? What's the difference between buying a "nigger in Africa, just to save him from being "burnt, or buried alive, or starved to death, and "buying one from a happy home in Virginia ? "No difference at all. So we'U stand to our "right, and go to Africa, as we used. The whole " earth then will be at our bidding. The "stupid Old World can do nothing with India or
Algiers, for they'll never know the right way to " go to work. They must all come to us." Thuis far we have ventured to give in our own words the reveries of ALNASCRAH . But at this point he starts on his legs, and, " rapt into future " times, the b_rd begi," a strain whlich defies abridgment:-
"Let such be the programme for the South to work out in future, and, if wisely and boldly pursued, we may feel assured of her destiny in all its fulness. Her cornu copia will never fail. Her might will never pass like the glory of Babylon. She wiU not sit forsaken amid the ruins of her magnificence, with none so poor to do her reverence. Defended on both flanks, fortified at every point of attack, the institution of slavery diffused as a vital element over all her territory, she will be politicaUy invincible; she may sit under her own fig-tree with none to make her afraid; and, the production of cotton keeping pace with the demand, the sceptre wil not pass from the Cotton King while there is a southern soil to be tilled, fit labour to till it, and inteligence to direct the labour."
Not so fast, gentle Southerner. You've alnost kicked over the institution itself with your last flourish. The elements of your calculation are the property of the whole world, and it wil be very hard indeed if the whole world allows you a monoIpoly of cotton. You've got the soil, and we don't deny you the intelligence. Youl have made your niggers do their work, and you are entitled to all the praise of successful enterprise and courage. Thus far we all of us look rather small by your side. In sober truth, the American slaveowner is one of the few consistent personages left on the earth, and should have a foremost niche in the next " Essays on Decision of Character." There is no subterfuge, no " sentimental humbuggery," as it is called in the Areiv Crleans Delta, about him. He does what he likes with his own; he avows his principles, acts up to them, and now openly prophecies a Millennium in which the cotton plant shal be the tree of life, and the ministering angels shall be of the family of HA31. On the contrary, the Abolitionists and Freesoilers, the Northern States and England, are aU playirg the hypocrite. We all live by the cotton tree. It is the British heart of oak. Many a baronial hall, many a church, many a guild, cities, navies, and other noble worls, have beenmade fromcottonwool, and fromthe swcat of the African who watered it and plucked the flozey pod, and cleaned it, and packed it in bales. Itlillions of our countrymen would never have seen the light but for this exotic production and for its cultivators. A failure of the crop is to a large part of our people a virtual faimine. Should the cultiv%tion of the plant find its limits-that is, should it not increase in equal proportion to the multiplication of the human race and its growing wants, we shall find ourselves more hideboind in our means of life than we are by the narrowness of these isles. We know all this. We know that the thread !of our national destiny is cotton. We know
that for all mercantile purposes England is one of the States; and that, in effect, we are paitneis with the Southern planter;
we hoTd a bill of sale over his goods and chattels, his live and dead stock, and take a lion's sbare in the profits of slavery. Yet, as a nation, we are stanch Abolitonists, we ffet M1rs. STOWv, cry over her books, and pray for an anti-slavery President. We thank GOD that no slave can exist on British soil, and only the other day some of our soberest statesmen were denouncing and prohibiting slave-grown sugar. But all this time we are clothing not only ourselves, but all the world besides, with the very cotton picked and cleaned by Uncle Tom and his fellow-sufferers. It is our trade. It is the great staple of British industry. We are MIr. LEGnEE'S agents for the manufacture and sale of his cotton crop. Should anything happen to Mr. LGErEss, and should he be so unfortunate as not to keep up his biack stock, we shall all be ruined, and shall have to take our place in the second rank of nations.
This wiU be thought mere croaking. We are all so accustomed to the ideas of national growth and commercial progress that we take for granted that we shal go on as we have done. Whatever we want, there will be enough of it. Thus it would seeni the American AL.LASCnAR vWas not at all out of the way in his anticipations, for there is no present probability of a cotton supply equal to the wants of our trade, except by some such process as he imagines. To produce more there must be more land brought into the cultivation and more hands to til it. But more hands cannot be procured, except by a revival of the slave trade in some form or other. Something, indeed, is done already by letting other countries supply uss with slave-grown sugar, while America gives more attention to slave-grown cotton. But we cannot have more American cotton without more American slavery. What are we to do, then, with our philanthropy? Some people -will advise us, under the circumstances, to get rid of it altogether; others to keep it for home use. We are of opinion that it may take another form. Instead of always giving the American slaveowner our money and oiur morality so mixed that he despises the one and hates the other, why cannot we ma';e greater efforts than we have done heretofore to extend the cultivation of free-grown cotton? India, of course, must and will give us more cotton now that the railways are at last forcing their -way into the heart of her dense population. Africa, according to Dr. LivINGsToN, is full of peoples and countries suited in all respects to the cultivation of cotton. Everything is ready but that enterprise, and skill, and money, which we only can supply. Why are not these forthconming? WVe hear on aU sides of capitalists who want employment for their money, adventurous minds who want objects worthy of their genius, philanthropists who want to spend life and money for the good of their species. The complaint is that in this old, used-up earth, there are no new fields of enterprise, no avenues of promotion, not even any good to be done. The religion of the age is continually urging people to some high, dreamy martyrdom. These are grand aspirations. Pity 'tis they should all evaporate in talk, in reading novels, or attending religious meetings. Let Briiish philanthropy, science, and capital put their heads together, as they have often done before, and seek a common object in the extension of the cotton cultivation without the aid of slavery. It is a work for missionaries and millionaires. It has just that combination of physical and spiritual objects that is most consistent with the general order of this world. We shall be able to know tl2 good we are doing by the good we receive, and the annual delivery of so many hundred thousand bales of cotton on our wharfs will constitute a more trustworthy report than 500 pages of twaddling correspondence.

Among the contributors to military discussion
Among thc contributors to military discussion we may now reckon no less a person than MajorGeneral WINsDIA-51, who has addressed a letter to the Lord-Lieutenant of Norfolk upon the expediency of improving the organization of the army according to a scheme therein delineated. This expression of his views the gaUant officer prefaces w6ith somue words of apology, as if the proceeding and its circumstances required justification in the eyes of the world. We can assure him that no such deprecation was needed. He has judged most correctly that the present moment is eminently suggestive of such endeavours, and, as his title to enter upon the subject is perfectly unimpeachable, we are glad to give his opinions al the publicity and consideration which he desires.
In a few words, his leading ideas may be thus described:-The great aim of his propositions is to secure the maintenance of a military force in such strength and of such a character as will suffice at any moment for any such occasions as it is reasonable to contemplate. We do not suppose him to desire the permanent establishment of an army upon a scale calculated by all the possible e.xigencies of European war; in fact, he distinctly disclaims any wish to see England swarming with soldiers, like the nations of the Continent. What he argues for is suchI a system as will enable us to take the field uipon emergencies in adequate strength, without the precipitation which, while doubling the cost, brings but imperfect results as the return. This end is to be accomplished by the formation of a reserve force, available at a very short notice, and the supplies of men both for this force and the regular army are to be insured by a better scheme of recruiting, and by continued improvements in the " education, " dress, comfort, and position" of the soldier. Our military establishments are to be so regulated that 40,000 well-trained and well-disciplined men can be added almost in a moment to the regular army without the least derangement of its organization, while the quality and popularity of the service are to be at the same time improved. These are the aims with which General WIrmOHi&'s suggestions are framed; we now subjoin a sketch of the proposals themselves.
The first great feature, and, indeed, the cardinal point of the scheme, is the permanent establishment of the Militia; the next, the creation of a close connesion between this force and the Line. Taking the infantry of the Militia at 80,000 men, General WnI-DHA3 would divide this body into two equal portions, one of which is to be styled " the ' first reserve." The next step in the project affects the Line. Mllost regiments, as our readers are aware, enjoy at least a nominal connexion with certain counties or districts of counties, and it will be recollected, we dare say, that recent regoulations have defined the proportions which the depot, or division of a regiment remaining at home while the main body of it is on service, shall bear to its wvhole strength. The depots of particular regiments, therefore, are to be permanently stationed in the counties from which they are presiumed to be raised, and with each of these dep6ts the first reserve of the county Militia is to serve aud be drilled for three months in every year, the officers of the two corps meeting together, and the w-hole body being under the commanding officer of the depOf. To cement the conuexion more firmly, it is proposed that every candidate for a commission in the Line should enter the Mlilitia first, so that in the end, supposing the Militia regiment to consist of eight companies of 100 each and the dep6t of two such, we should have a tolerably strong battalion under arms in every county for a
quarter of the year. 'When tho first roserve goes off duty its men are to receive a continuation of pay to the extent of 2d. or 3d. a-day in the shape of a retaining fee, for which they are to be bound to join the regular army in a body when occasion may require. The method of junction would be by simply uniting each first. reserve to its county depdt, and then turning over the whole as a second battalion to the regiment which the dep6t represented.
This scheme, of course, involves the maintenance in a slightly varied form of a greater number of soldiers than before, and would increase accordingly the demand for recruits. Of the suggestions towards supplying this demand some have been already expressed in the foregoing proposition, inasmuch as it is reckoned that by this close conhexion of the Line and the Militia a constant crurent of eligible recruits would be kept up from the latter to the former. But General WIsNDILI is not satisfied with this provision. He wishes to elevate the position of the soldier generally, to divest it of the objectionable attributes still attaching to it from the indiscriminate process of recruiting, and to make a place in the ranks of the army as desirable in all respects as any other situation which the applicants would be likely to obtain. For this purpose he would educate the soldier in diligent and prudent habits, and,what is more, he would hold out to him-though this proposition is represented as distinct and separable from the two others-a far more extensive prospect of rewards than exists at present. First, he would fill aU the special corps of the armiy, such as those of Sappers, Miners, Pioneers, Orderlies, Land Transport, &c. (to enjoy a slight increase of pay), with men who have earned such promotion in the ranks of the Line; and, next, he would give non-commissioned officers and soldiers the option of all Government situations adapted to their qualifications in the Excise, Customs, country post-offices, &c. These being the prizes of military service, and a good latitude of selection being provided in the anticipated abundance of reermits, it is concluded that the ranks of the Line would be regarded in the light of a gocl professioR by parents as well as sons.
Having thus placed General WL-DH.UA'S ideas before the public for consideration, we have only to offer a remark or two of our own. The flow of recrnits from the MIilitia to the Line must, of course, exhaust the Militia, which in its turn must depend upon ordinary reeruiting. General Wixxn11AM himself doubts -whether the supply thus required could be provided by voluntary enlistment, and he is in favour of the ballot. But on this assumption we should like to know how the division of a Militia regiment into two equal parts, one being liable to service with the Line, is to be accomplished; for, supposing it could not be done by volunteering, anything like compulsion in forming the first reserve, after the ballot had provided the main body, would resemble a conscription for the regular army. Again, if the dep6t of every Line regiment is to be constantly, and without change, stationed in its p2culiar courty, and if the officers of this regiment are to be taken from the Militia regiment of the shire, while the ranks are recruited from the district in like manner, would not such a course of proceeding, even if the system were not absolutely exclusive, tend to localize battalions somewhat too narrowly? No doubt, under such a plan, "the 52d would really become the Oxfordshire "Light Infantry," but would it be any the better regiment, or would it be the old 52d still ? Anld would not the access to the profession be rather hampered when an aspirant's chance of a commisbion was con6ned for the most part to a particular regiment, to be reached through a corresponding corps of Militia? It seems to us that such would be the case, unless, indeed, it is proposed to throw open the Militia while contracting the field of the Line.
Again, with regard to the rewards to be attached to military service through the civil offices specified, if General W1TNDHAAM would give soldiers a monopoly of these things,-if these plates were " onily to be " obtained by entering the anny,"-would not such an arrangement excite discontent, as savouring too much of a military constitution ? That many soMi'rs become adniirably adapted for certain places at home is undeniable, but it is a long step in advance to make service in the army the necers-ry passport to them all. Of course, as the author of the suggestions himself observes, the system proposed wouhl break up that of dep6t battalions, and interfere in some degree with that of the permanent encampments illustrated at Aldershott; but to these objections the gaUant General attaches no great weight, as he is " not sure that the present system of dep6t " battalions is tbe best," aid " has his doubts" as to the permanent encampments. These, however, are his views, combined, as might be expecte. with excellent remarks upon the management of soldiers generally; nor do we doubt that they will receive a careful attention oG the part of his countrymen.

(By ZI.tsIO 1ThLSGRAPJI.)
IAst night the anntual meeting of Free tn,ders titd friends of political progress at HaDchesteSr was held at the Fr4a Trade-hall, and was numerously attended. Mr. Wilson presided, and there were preeont Mr. Gib3on, M.P., M3z Hadfield, )LP., Mfr. Cheetham, M,P., and Mr. Heywood; ILP.
The CHAIR3SA2x, in opening the meeting, dwelt upon the great services rendered by Mr. Bright, and read the follow. ing letter:-
Rcchedalo, iSor. S. 15i56.
"3y dear Wilson,-I mentioned to you a few days ago that I wa about to leave England for a con.iderabl tirme, probably for several moouths. My health, as you know, is greatly improved during the pat six months, so mucx so a to afford strong reason for the beliet that a further period of relaxation, and change of objects and Snterests, wi
so far --store me sa to enable me again to attend to public business. I haTe consulted, physicians of extensive practice and emineut in the profession, and their oplnions all concar in this,-that a complete rest. from Public labour for a longer period Is necesay; and that tbis, it may be hoped and believed, will give me renewed bealth and streugth. Acting upon this advice, which my own judgment entirety approves, I Am about to leave home for some months, and I shill, therefore, in Alt probability, not be able to attend the Houso of Commaons during the next ses-ion of Parliament.
"I think it my duty, under these ciecuratances to write to you in JOur capacity ot chairman of the comumittee which undertook the management of my election in 1852. I am very sensible of the kindness shown to me by my constituents, Inasmuch as 1 believe they freely consented to my absence from Parliament during the psa: selou In absenting .myt for another smion, however, I feel that I am bound to enter into a more public aud definto exp'anztiou with
"Incapablo, as I am at presoeit, of performing any of the duties of their representative it would eem to be my duty to resignmy seat iu Parlament, and to give them the opp ortuuSty of electing miyeuccessor. I feel, however, that the wishes and convenience of the constituency ought to be consn ted before I decide. If we were at the beginning instead of being, as we are, vcry near the e nd of a rarliameut, the interests of all concemed would probably be begt pr;rziod by my Immediate resignmtions; but, as a general election is ilsely to take Dlace during the Iear 1857. it may not be thought desirable to have two elections for Manchester during the same year. This is a point which I am Anxious to refer to my frienda in SIanchester before I do anytising which would make an Immediate election unavoldable.
"You will greatly oblige me, therefore, if you wilU take such steps as aPpear to you beat to acertain the wiahes of my coostituents an to the course I sh3uld take. I shall be guided by their decisiou, either to vacate my seat in Parliameat on the opening of the coming ses. Rion. or to retain it tU the dislutiorn of the PArliament, which may come in the spring, and is albmost certain to come in the autumn oC
" I hope I rm not too sanguine in believing that a fewr months more of rest-rest of the facuties wvhihch have had almost no rest during the Dast 15 yeara-will restore to me the power, as I still have the w1, to labour in that field in which so much or my Ufe hbs been spentIf I am permitted to recover my former strength before the occurrence of a general election, I sbaUl then bope for a continuance of the confidence which the electors of Man chester have so long placed in me; It renewed health be not granted to me, I shall then withdraw from public life, rmembering, as long as I live, bow much I owve to the kindness and forbearanise of those in whose name and on whose belsalf I have acted for nine years pas, in the nouse of Commons.
MEleve me. very sincerely yoursa
" JOHN BRIGHT." He then moved the following resolution:-
That this meeting, in expresing its profound regret at the circumstances which unhappily necessitate the absence of its esteemed rePresentative, John Bright, Esq., MaP.. desires to record ita unabated conviction of the signal ability and high moral courage, und. verWsaly acknowledged, with which he has hitherto represented this great metropolis of industry in Parliamnct; that it hereby bege respect, fuly to express its admiration of the undeviating consstency, and nDbinbAing firmness, ith vwhich he has adhered tothose great principle on lwhich ho was elected, as wel as its warmest gratitnde for the eminent services which he has rendered to the nation; that, while deeply sympathizing with him under the serious indirposition which has compeUed him to retire, for a seasen, f rom public duties, it derives the sincerest satisfaction from the prospeC t that he wil be able, ere long, to re-enterulponsthem; andlthat, while cheerful.y conceding to him the interval of repose which may be necessary for the compItte restoration of his health, it requests him to allow the continuance Of his Parliamentary conuexion with this city, In the earneet bope that the cause of popular rights, of social progress, and of interational concord may soon regain the assistance of hbs disinterested and distinguished advoacy in the House of Commouns "
Mr. BAZLEY seconded the resolution, and it was adopted unanimously.
Air. T. MI. Ginsox, LI.P., adverting to the late war, said, opinions were divided as to whether the results were glorious or disgraceful to this country; but he knew with certainty that one result was greatly increased expenditure, and consequently we lhad increased taxes. He trasted now that we should return to a peace expenditure. He objected to a large standing army, and as there could be no great reduction in the civil expenditure, ve must look mainly to economy in the army, navy, and ordnance. It was said that we must not be unprepared for war, as before, bat he denied that the disasters in the Crimea resulted from want of means, but took place because the people of this country could not supply those who had the management of it with brains. (Cheers.) lie did not join in the cry against the incometax. The indirect taxes were nearly 42,0UO,OOOl. levied upon the great mars of consumers, or 9-1Oths of the people, and as these taxes were paid before the articles reached consumers 10,000,0001. more might be added as cost of collection, and upon profits and interest upon capital He did not deny there was injustice in the mode of levying the income-tax, but it was the only means of fairly reachiung the fundhoIder and landholder, and ought not to he wholly abandoned. He moved,-
That, is the opinion of this meeting, the rc-establishuentof peace renders it the imperative duty of the Government to diminish at once the existing load of taxation, which, by inijuriously affecting the industrial interesis of the country, is seriously detrimental to the material wellbeing and social happinres of all classes of the community : and that, whilo Pledging itself to relax none of its exertions to procure a wise, etfigdent, aLd eoonomical expenditure of the national resonrces, it looks to a Just and comprehensive measure of Parliamentary reforma as the only adequate mears by which the acts of tbe Legislature may be brought Into permanent harmony with the convictions and interests ot the people."
Mfr. CHESTIAN, M.P., seconded the niotion, which was carsied.
Ar. HADFI'IILD, .P., and others afterwards addressed the meeting.

Election Of A Proctor In Convocation.-There
ELECTION OF A PROCTOR IN- CONVOcmTION.-There was a meeting of beneficed clergymen of the diocess of Oxford at St. Mary's Church, Oxford, yesterday, to elect a Proctor in the Lower House of Convocation in the place of the late Professor Hussey. The Bishop of Oxford presided, and there was a large attendance of clergy. When tho Bishop took the cbair the Rev. Thomas Curme, vicar of Sandford, objected to the constitution of the Synod, and only desisted from his objection at an intimation from the chairman that he would send for a policeman to take the rev. gentleman into custody, if he interrupted the proceedirngs. After some fosmal acts Mr. Curmc again interposed, and said he wished to hand in a respectful protest against the whole proceedings. The Bishop said, Mr. Curme could not protest at that stage. The Rev. Charles Barter, I.A., rector of Sarsden and Cornwell, then nominated the ltev. Charles Lloyd, rector of G;eat Hlampden, which was seconded by the Rev. E. Bobhouse, vicar of St. Peter's-in-the-East, Oxford. The Rev. A. lsham, rural dean and rector of Weston Turville, Bucks, nominatcd the Rev. W. R. Freinantle, rector of Claydon, Bucks, and remonstrated against the nomination of Mfr. Lloyd, as he was one of the Bishop's chaplains. The Rev. J. Browne, rector of Kiddington, Oxon, seconded the nominetion. The Bishop then took a show of hands, wben there were-for Mtr. Lloyd, 88; for Mr. Fremantle, 31.
DRURY-LA%N; THEATRE.-The annual meetingf of the proprietors and renters of this theatre was held yeaterday afternoon in tbe saloon; Mr. B. B. Cabbell, M.P., presided. The chairman opened the proceedings by congratulating the proprietors on the favourable position of their affairs since the house had been let to Mr. Smith. The secretary read the report, which stated,-" The committee have placed before the proprietors the statement of accounts for the pst year. The committee feel that it cannot be necessary for them to remind the proprietors of the sensation which was caused vithin those waUs by the destruetion of Covent-garden Theatre. Suggestions and comniunications were continuaUly being add-'essed to the committee, wbo had already decided to consult the best practical authority as to the adequacy of the means h:therto used in the house for its protection in case of fire. Mr. Braidwood had insDected the theatre, and certain sug. ges had bcen masde by that gentlemau, and nadd by the committee. ''There were now several firemen constantly in the theatre, vho were under the control of the polce, under the sanction of the Chief Commissioner. The cash account for the past year showed that the entire receipts amounted to 51921. 12s., iLcluding a balance in hand at last audit of 107i. 14s. The entire paymentsfor the same period had amounted to 4.8911. Os. 3d., ieaving a balance in hand of 3011, 2s. 9d. The aniount received from the lessee (5Mr. Smith) was 4,0001., together with 6451. for extra performances. Four quarters' rent had bet n paid to the Dake of Bedford during the year, leavin
seven quarters in arrear. The trustees of the renters hag received G001., and all the tradesmuen's bills had been regularly paid." The report was, on the inotion of the chairmllan unanimously adopted. The reportof the architect was then read; it spoke in favourable terms of the present state of the edifice. The retiring membess of the coinntittee were reelected. A vote of thanks was then awarded to Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith returned thanks.

The Persian War.
THE PERSIAN WAR.
THE CAPTURE OF BUSHIRE.
[A portion of the following appeared ia our second edi.ion of yesterday :-1
The following is the letter of our Bombay corre-1spondent:
"BOIB.AY, JAN. 2.
"The members of the Bombay Government and the public generally were beainning to look with -some anxiety for news of the Persian expedition, 'vhen, on Christmas-eve, arrived the steam frigate Semiramis, with despatches announcing the capture -of Bushire, and the occupation of the Island of Karrack.
" When I closed my last letter a slow native -craft had just brought us letters from the Admiral -and the head-quarters division of the fleet, dated 3luscat, November 19. By the 24th, as we now learn, the whole force had reached the appointed -place of rendezvous, the port of Bunder Abbas. 'Thence they made sail for Bushire on the 26th in ,three divisions. On the 29th the steam frigate Feroze, towing two transports, and the corvette
'alkland hove in sight of the town, affording to the garrison and inhabitants the first certain informa,tion of the approach of an armed British force. The Governor immediately addressed Captain Jones, the Resident, officially, inquiring as XU the destination of the vessels, and their -errand in Persian waters. The Resident's a'eply was despatched on the 3d of December from -he flagship Assaye, whither he had repaired for -conference with General Stalker and Sir Henry iLeake. It announced that the functions of the vriter in counexion with Persia had ceased by order -of the British Government, and that it lay with the " Sirdar General Sahib' to answer the Governor's queries. This the General did by sending, together with Captain Jones'sletter, a copy of the proclamation of war put forth by the Governor-General of India. No answer was received to these comanunications, and on the day following, the 4th, Karrack was taken possession of as a military depot, -and occupied by two companies of the 2d Beloschees. Wo opposition was offered-indeed, our people found -only a handful of ill-fed and unpaid mercenaries, to whom their advent was rather a boon than other-ise. The Island of Karrack, once the seat of a B)utch factory expelled from Bussora, was, it will ~be remembered, held by a British force during the greater part of 1839 and the two following yeara. It is about 4@ miles long, and lies to the north-west of Bushire, distant about 30 miles. On the 6th most of the transports, which had been somewhat 'scattered by head wsinds, having rejoined, the fleet dropped down to Halilla-bay, 12 miles to the south-east of Bushire. This was the spot recommended for the landing of the troops by Captain Ethersey, -of the Indian Navy, Commander of the Gtulf 'squadron, and a better (writes the Resident) could not have been selected. On the morning of the bth, with most favourable weather, and the sea as smooth as a mirror, the landing commenced. Eight ,gunboats, armed with 24-pounder howitzers, were sent in advance, and by a few well-directed shots -cleared a date grove near the beach of a party of the enemy, who retired with the loss, as was afterwards discovered, of a leader of some note. The dis-ambarcation then proceeded without molestation, -and continued for two days. No beasts of burden 'being procurable, tents and baggage of all kinds were left in the ships, and the men landed with three days' rations in their havresacks. At this time -of year there is frequently heavy rain in the Gulf; but now, fortunately, the weather was fine and -clear, and tho men were comparatively slightly inconvenienced. On the morning of Sunday, -the 9th, the force commenced its advance upon Bushire, distant, as I have said, about 12 miles. I should mention, by the way, as it may occur -to you to wonder that a nearer point was not -selected for the disembarcation, that the coast from Bushire to Halilla Bay presents an unbroken line of -cliff, of no great height indeed, yet quite insurmountable for artillery, while in the bight of the bay the land slopes gently upwards from a fine broad beach. The first brigade, commanded by -Colonel Stopford, was on the right; the second, itnder Colonel Honner, on the left. The steam frigates moved on the left flank of the army in support. Gradually drawing ahead, Sir Henry Leeke, in the Assaye, found himself about noon -abreast of the old Porttuguese (in the despatches -called Dutch) Fort of Rushire, four and a half miles below Bushire. This and the neighbouring ruins he observed to be occupied in force by the enemy. The position is described as a strong one, the fort -having the cliff on one side, and a vall and ditcb, deep though dry, on the others. The Assaye, at 1,700 yards distance, immediately opened fire with shot and shell from her eight-inch guns. 'The effects were shortly seen in the precipitate Fight from the fort of a large portion of its garrison, of which the whole force is estimated at from 1,500 to 2,000 men. Some 800, as it is supposed, remained, however, to stand the attack of the army, which was now rapidly approaching in linc. As the troops came up with the enemy the Assaye necessarily ceased firing, and General Stalker finding the enemy's shot dropping among his men gave the word for the assault. Brigadier Stopford had dismounted to lead his brigade in the rush at the works. With a wave of his sword he -was just calling to the men of his own regiment, the 64th, to come on, when a matehlock baU struck him in the breast, and he dropped dead upon the spot, shot through the heart. Furious at the fall -of their colonel, his corps dashed at the enemy's position, and in honourable rivalry with the Europeans was the other regiment of the brigade, the 20th Native Infantry, through whose ranks went the cry that the corps had never been in action before, and that now was the time to show what it could do. The 2d Europeans and the rest of the second brigade were also well up. For a while the fighting was sharp, and the bayonet bloodily at work as the assailants forced the enemy back from the ruined houses and garden walls, and closed upon the fort. That entered, the survivors among its 'defenders broke out and endeavoured to effect their -escape. Many slipped down the low cliff, and were makiing off unperceived, when the 4th Rifles, who were ou the extreme left of the advance, resting -upon the sea, cauglht sight of them, and brought 'their tire to bear upon them with fatal effect. -Others got out upon the plain and were then charged by the Poonah Horse and a squadron of the 3d -Cavalry. In command of the latter was Colonel 3Ialet. This officer in the nnfIc saved the life of a
man wnom a trooper was about to cut down. The Colonel turmed away, and the scoundrel, catching up his matchlock, which he had dropped on imploring quarter, shot his benefactor dead. Two other officers fell in the affair, both Lieutenants in the -20th, Utterson and Warren, and yet-most strange disproportion-one only was returned as wounded. Among the native and non-commisioned -officers and men the loss amounted to six killed and 36 wounded. Our opponents in this smart skiomish were not regular Persian troops, but Arab mencenaries belonging to two of the most powerful among the sea-coast tribes- the Dashti and the Tungestooni-and lost, it is believed, three chiefs of note, besides great numbers of lower degree.
"M Meaiiwbile Captain Jones, the Resident, had proceeded to Bushire in a small steamer, bearing a summons to the Governor to surrender, and offering most favourable conditions both to soldiers and to non-combatants. But his flag of truce was fired upon from the town, and he returned to the Ad-
miral. An apology from the Governor followed, disclaiming the discourteous act, which he attributed to the ignorance of an artilleryman, and begging for 24 hours' delay, which the General and Admiral promptly refused. The anchorage was buoyed during the night by the boats of the fleet, and at 8 in the morning of the 10th the steamers anchored off the defences of the town with springs upon their cables, while the army approachcd upon the land side. A redoubt commanding t' v works on the plain, from which Bushire derives its supply of water, was shelled in the morning by some of the lighter vessels, and its garrison forced to retire into the town. The engagement then commenced between the ships and the defences, and continued for four hours, when the enemy finally ceased firing, and lowered the Persian colours. Their firing is said to have been steady and Nvell sustained, yet, strange to say, not a sinlgle man in the fleet was touched. The Semiramis was hulled once, and she and the Feroze and others suffered a little in their masts and rigging, but that was all. It is true that the principal strength of the defences was on the land side, where the enemy expected to be attacked, and were ready, so far as regards the number of guns, to give us a very warm reception indeed. Still there were many guns on the sea face also ; and, moreover, at the southern angle of the town were tho troublesome erections in the nature of stockades, formed of date trees, stronglyfaced with an earthen embankment. These it took some time and good gunnery to silence. It was noon when the Persian flag fell and the ships ceased firing. The army was then drawn up in line opposite the land face of the tow n; and their imposing attitude, and the recollection of the sk;irmish the day before, no doubt had their share in indncing the Persian Commandant to surrender. After some little delay, and not without threats of an assault, the gate opened, and the Governor and the Commander of the Forces came out and surrendered themselves prisoners of war. Another notable personage was taken, who had, I believe, been sent down from Teheran to raise the tribes against as, and whose Persian title is translated 'Minister of Foreign Affairs.' The remainder of the garrison who marched (-ut gave up their arms, and, being too numerous to be retained in the present state of the commissariat, were escorted some distance into the interior by the Poonah Horse, and there set free. At half-past 4 the British flag was hoisted by Lieutenant Clarkson, First of the Assaye, on the Residency flagataff, the Shah's. staff having been felled ~by the garrison in their burry to lower the flag.
" Thus easily has Bushire fallen; not more easily, perhaps, than was expected; but far more easily (I suppose) than the state of its defences, improved to a degree previously unsuspected, deserved. The captive Governor frankly says he was not prepared for the ships coming in so close. "CYou always used to lie two or three miles out," he says. "I thought you did not know the anchorage, and I took care to get hold of all the pilots. If your troops had assaulted the gate on the land side they would have seen what I had got ready for them,"-and an assault wouldno doubt havebeen attended with great loss, for the gunners in the place were of the regular Persian artillery, and are said to be very good, though their practice against the ships must be confessed to have been indifferent. But the capitulation found at first but little favour with the army, and in the ranks of the 64th especially there were growls of " No, no !" " Assault; assault !" and vengeful clutchings of firelocks. And afterwards in the town i fear that things were done which were not good to do, and are not good to telL But when the Semiramis left all was orderly again. The main body of the force was cantoned near the wells upons the plain, a portion garrisoning the town, which had been proclaimed British territory and a free port. The bazaars were reopened, the people adapting themselves readily to the change of masters.
"Three days after the fall of the placir Henry Leeke left in the Assaye, bringing with him the three principal prisoners, the captured flag, and various specimens of Persian arms and accoutrements. (The flag is to be sent home, I believe, and probably some of the accoutrements, which will be found to be very European in character). While running down the coast on his way to Bassadore the Admiral was boarded by an Arab chief. The object of his visit was, it appeared, to proffer the services of his tribe in our war with the Persians. All the tribes of the coast, he said, would prefer our rule to that of the Shah. In the course of the interview a valuable piece of information was obtained zom him. Near a town on the coast, caUed LinSar, a well-equipped Persian force of 3,000 men was assembled, with the intention of crossing to the Idand of Kishm and attacking our depot sta. tion of Bassadore. Dismissing the sheikh with fair words, Sir Henry steamed on, and, soon coming abreast of the Persian camp, opened upon it with his heavy guns. His fire was instantly returned, but only from nine-pounder field guns, of which the balls failed to reach the ship, while the eight-inch shot and shell crashed through the camp, knocking over men, horses, and camels, and flinging the tent-canvass to the winds. As a matter of course, the enemy had to retire, but they did it coolly and well. They may abandon their views upon Bassadore; but, even if they do not, the Plnjab, sister ship to the A.ssaye, is lying there now, and a considerable force of Marines is intrenched n shore.
" The question remains, will the Shah succuimb <n learning the fall of Bushire? That he will do so n ust make one among the many conjectures respecting the future of the war; but that he will not appears at present more probable. The late Governor, or Durga Beg (Lord of the Sea), strongly affirms that his master is prepared to resist to the uttermost, and copies of the Teheran Gazette have been brought down from Bushire, which not only contain general orders, after the European fashion, complimenting and rewarding the officers and men who were en. gaged at Herat, but also announce the impending invasion by the infidels, and call upon the country to rise in arms and expel them from the territory of the faithful. It is, of course, possible that the ardour of the Governnment of Teheran may evaporate at hearing-if, indeed, they truly hear-of the broadsides of the fleet and the bayonets and guns of
the army. But the Government of India is prepared to follow up forcibly the blow that has been struck. Seven thousand additional troops are to be sent up forthwith, all, or nearly all, from the Bombay Presidency, and rumours even swell the full amount of the second force to 25,000 men. At any rate, the 14th Light Dragoons and 78th Highlanders are under orders, and one of the two regiments of Scinde Horse, their Commandant, Colonel Jacob, being designated for the command of the whole cavalry division. There will doubtless be one or more native regiments, and a light battalion is to be formed of flank companies from 10 different regiments. General Outram is here, and goes up with the supreme command, either in the Semiramis or the Assaye. A field battery from Sholapore and a troop of Horse Artilery from Kurrachee wiU also form part of the contingent. For Sappers and Miners it is probable that the Madras Presidency will be drawn upon. Irregular Cavalry regiments
are to be raised from the friendly or mercenary Arab tribes on the coasts.

Head-quarters, Field Force, Bushire, Dec. 12, 1856.
Sir,-I have the honour to report, for the information of his Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, the complete success which, under the protection of Almighty God, has attended our arms. The British flag waves over the walls of Bushire. The place, infinitelystrongerthanI hadany reason to believe fromtheinformation Ihadreceived, surrendered on the appearance of our troops before it on the 10th inst. The previous day we had a smart affair in dislodging the enemy from a strong position they occupied in the old Dutch fort of Rushire. The casualties on this occasion, though numerically smiall, were principally among the officers, and, I regret to say, included Brigadier Stopford and LieutenantColonel Malet, 3d Light Cavalry, killed; Captain Wood, Lieutenants Utterson and Warren, 20th Regiment, wounded, the two latter since dead (Captain Wood, thongh severely wounded, is doing well). The lesson the enemy received on this occasion, together with the bombarding of the works, the imposing appearance of the troops in line, and of the fle. t, was doubtless the cause of their waant of spirit irn surrendering the strongly fortified town of Bushire, in which we have found 59 guns,* with large quantities of ammunition and warlike stores. The governor of the place and tho commander of the troops came out and gave up their swords. They, and one of the principal officials, are now in my camp, and wil be sent to Bombay. The garrison, to the number of 1,500 or 2,000 men (a large number having previously effected their escape, and very many others having been drowned in attemupting to do so), grounded their arms in front of our line, and were next morning escorted by the cavalry some distance in to the country and set free. Every assistance and co-operation have been rendered by the fleet, a heavy fire was opened in the early morning and kept up spiritedly for some hours, till the place surren. dered. At Rushire also, the previous day, all the co-opera. tion possible was rerdered by the fleet. And my very best thanks are due to Sir Henry Leeke, the officers, andseamen, for their unwearied exertions in landing troops, which, owing to the absence of any other boats than those of the fleet, was a work of snuch labour, occupying the greater part of three days and two nights. The force landed at Halilla Bay, about 12 or 13 miles south of Bushire, without any serious opposition, a body of 300 or 400 men who ap. p ared being scattered by the fire of the gunboats. There being no carriage cattle, the troops were landed without tents or baggage of any description, three days' rations being carried in the havresacks. The hardships which the men have been called upon to undergo bave been endured most cheerfaUy, and I cannot say too much in their praise. Being still without our baggage, I have been unable as yet to obtain the reports caled for from the several officers command. ing brigades, regiments, and detachments, but I shall do m% self the honour to enclose them for the information of his Excellency the Commander-in-Chief.
I ought to have mentioned that on approaching Bushire the enemy were observed to occupy in some force an intrnnched position, with a strong redoubt, about a mile and a half from the waUs, and commanding the weUs from which the main supply of water for the town is derived. This position was precipitately abandoned on my line being formed, It also had sastained a bombardment from the fleet.
I would beg especially to mention the unwearied exertions and valuable aid rend ered to me, from the landing at Halila Bay to the taking of Bushire, by my AssistantAdjutant-General Lieutenant-Colonel Younghusband; Captain Wray, the Assistant Qaartermaster-General; Major Hil, commanding Engineers; Captain Dansterville, Assistant-Commissary-G eneral; and Dr. Mackenzie, the Superintending Surgeon.
Brigadier Stopford and Lieutenant-Colonel Malet died leading on their men In the most gallant style. Brigadior Honner, commanding the 2d Infantry Brigade; Lieutenant. Colonel Shepheard, who succeeded to the command of the 1st Infantry Brigade; Lieutenant-Colonel Trevelyan, commanding the Artillery Brigade; and Lieutenant-Colonel Tapp, commanding the Cavalry Brigade, have earned my warmest thanks for the manner in which their arduous duties have been carried, as also Captain Pottinger, Brigade-Major of Arillery, whose exe rtions were conspicuous; and my best thanks are equally due to Major Sterling, commanding Her Majesty's 64th Regiment; to Captain M'Leod, who succeeded to the command of the 20th Regiment; to Lieutenant- Colonel Ramsay, commanding the 2d European Light Infantry; to Major Manson, commanding the 4th Rifles; to Captain Hough, commanding the 2d Belooch battalion; to Captain Forbes, who sacceeded to the command of the 3d Light Cavalry; to Major Blake commanding the 4th troop of Horse ArtiUery; to Captain Hatch, commanding iNo. 3 light field battery; to Captain Gibbard, commanding No. 5 light field battery; and to Captain Dickinson, commanding the Sappers and Miners.
I have also derived every possible assistance from my aide-de-camp, Captain Hunter; Major Ballard, head of the Intelligence Department; Major Boye, the Deputy JudgeAdvocate-General; Captain Rigby, who has acted as my Persian interpreter; Captain Firnimore, Commhissary of Ordnance; Captain Collier, Deputy Assistant-AdjutantGeneral; Captain Shewell; and Lieutenant Holand, Deputy Assistant-Quartermaster-General; Major Barr, Paymaster; and Lieutenant WiUoughby, Sub-Assistant Commissary-General.
Lord DunkeUin, of the Coldstream Guards; Major Taylor, of the Persian Embassy; and Mr. Johnstone, of the Indian navy, also rendered most efficient service (having attached themselves to my personal staff ); and to Mr. John. stone's knowledge of the country and its inhabitants ith the unwearied 7zeal he has exhibited, I am much indebted.
In fine, nothing could have surpassed the admirable spirit exhibited by the officers and men of all ranks, and the utmost praise is due for their zeal, devotion, and gaUantry.
I have the honour to be, &c.,

From Rear-Admiral Sir Henry J. Leeks, K.H., R.N.,
Commanding Naval Force, Persian Gulf Expedition, to the Right Hon. Lord Elphinstone, G.C.H., Governor of Bombay:-
Hon. Company's steam-frigate Assays, at anchor off
Bushire, Dec. 10, 1856.
My Lord,- It becomes my pleasing duty to report to your Lordship in Council that, after a bombardment which
commenced this morning at 8 o'clock between the Persian batteries and the men-of-war of the Indian navy, and lasted on both sides until nearly an hour after noon, the town of Bushire has been taken, and the flag of our Sovereign is now flying on the citadel.
It was determined that the disembarcation of the troops should take place in Halilla Bay, about 10 miles south of the town. All was ready en the morning of the 7th inst., and the gun-boats in advance to cover the landing, when a number of the enemy were discovered in a date-grove about 200 yards to the left of the beach. The boats opened fire, and after the exchange of a few shots the enemy retired. Here the famous chief, the son of Baucher Rhan, was klled by a sheU from one of the advanced boats, which, I trust, gave a check to, and prevented the approach of, a large number of Persian troops who would have very much harassed the army while landing.
On the following day I paid a vlsit to General Stalker at the camp, and on parting I promised him that I would keep close to the shore in this ship and support the left of the army on its approach to the fort of Rushire (about four miles from this place), where it was supposed, from the information we had received, the enemy, in number from 1,500 to 2,000, would receive our troops and make a powerful zesistawee. On'my nearing the fort this information was confirmed, and we saw it perfectly full of Persian soldiers, who were drawn up ready for the attack. At this moment I was about 1,700 yards from them, when we commenced firing shell-many dropping within the trenches and committing much slaughter, obliging the Persian troops to fly, with the exception of about 500, who made a resolute
stand, alid were driven out by the troops in one of the most brilliant and gallaut charges I ever witnessed. Here the roops halted for the night.
I then pushed on for this roadstead, and at daylight this morning, seeing the Persian army drawn up near the wels (their centre supported by a high fortified tower and redoubt), it was my duty to dislodge them; and for this service I ordered the Falkland sloop, Ajdaha steam-frigate, Berenice, and Victoria steam-6loop, under the command of Lieutenants Transon, Worsley, Chitty, and Giles, and eight heavy-armed gunboats, under Lieutenant Stradling, to place their ships in position to attack it. This was done in a most gallant way, and in the course of an hour I had the satisfaction to see the whole of the Persian troops in full retreat to the town, but in perfect order and with great coolness, supported by their artillery. A boat, with a white flag, was now seen approaching the ship, and on one of the chiefs arriving on board a request was made by the Governor of the town for a delay of operations for 24 hours, to offer terms. This I instantly refused, in consequence of his having fired on one of our sinal steamers, bearing a flag of truce, the day before. Half an hour was given him to get out of the way of our shot; and the ships having been placed in line of battle, my flag-ship in the centre, the action commenced, and continued on both sides for two hours, when, observing two batteries outside the town, one a kind of miniature Malakhoff, harassing the Semiramis and Feroze, I directed our fire towards them, and in three hours they were perfectly silenced and the gans dismounted. A tower on the north-west angle of thf fort and a masked battery below the Residency Flagstaff, outside the wals, kept up a constant and steady fire upon the Semiramis and Feroze. It was necessary to slence them also; and, seeing that both ships were much damaged by their steady aim, the foremost guns of this ship were ordered to be directed towards them, and in the course of an hourboth batteries ceased firing.
I was now anxious to make an opening inthe wall of the town, that the troops might have nothing in their way, if General Stalker, on his arrival, determined upon carrying the place by assault. Our fire was therefore directed to the S.W. angle, and the breach commenced by knocking down a part of the tower and the embrasure, in which a gun was mounted, as weU as the lower part of the wall. The fire from the batteries at this time gradually slackened, and at this moment the flagstaff in the town was hauled down in token of submission, and the place surrendered.
The army was by this time close to the town, and it was a source of the greatest pleasure to me to feel that we had cleared away every obstacle that presented itself on their onward march, the more so as they had lost so many gallant fellows the day before when storming the Fort of Rushire.
The ships of the fleet have suffered considerably in their hulls, masts, and rigging from the fire of the enemy's guns; the Semiramis and the Feroze have some shot through them, but nothing to prevent all being ready for sea in a day or two. I am most happy to add that no person has been touched, nor has any casualty occurred during the four hours and a-half we were under fire. How this has happened is miraculous, for the grape shop which fell at every instantaround and abreast the gunboats and the round shot over and about our ships were very severe, and proved thar our enemy were more formidable [than they were supposed to be even by those who had known the town years before, there being 59 guns mounted on the batteries.
It now becomes a pleasing part of my duty to bring to the notice of your Lordship in Council the very great assistance I have received from Commodore Ethersey (who met me off the Island of l;ishm, and from his knowledge of this place gave me much valuable information), Captains Jenkins and Young, Commanders Macdonald (in charge of all the transports) and Rennie, and Acting Commanders Foulerton and Adams, the latter the captain of this ship, the officers, petty officers, and seamen of the fleet under my command; nor can I ever forget their gallant conduct in this day's battle, or their cheerfulness and activity in carrying out my orders and in moving their ships into position abreast of the batteries, and I am sure the Government will think with me that this was no easy task to perform, ior most of the vessels drew from 15 to 16 feet water, and we had to take them (at high water) some way through soft mud to get near enough to the forts, and this under a heavy fire.
Where all have so ably and gallantly performed their duty, it is difficult to particularize individuals, but I desire to express my warm thauks to Captain Griffith Jenkins, the first captain of this ship, for the very great assistance he has afforded me thoroughout the whole of the operations, and particularly during the action. He was the first offlcer, assisted by Major Hill, of the Engineers, and Lieutenant Clarkson, the first lieutenant of my flagship, to enter the town and hoist the British flag.
I trust, my Lord, it will not be taking too much upon myself to express my admiration of the galant conduot of General Stalker andjhis brave army, the more so as I have had the honour of being associated with them for many weeks, and have been an eye-witness of all their proceedings from the day of landing, as well as on their advance to the town. In doing so I offer the humble tribute of a British admiral to the brave general, his .fficers, and soldiers, whose dashing conduct on the day of storming the Fort of Rushire can never be forgotten.
I cannot deny myself the satisfaction of bringing to the notice of your Lordship in Council the excellent manner in which the commanders, officers, and crews of the Peninsular and Oriental (ompany's ships Precursor, Pottinger, Chusan, and Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy have conducted their ships during the time they have been with the fleet. They are at all times ready for any hard work, and have rendered me very essential service, and I beg to express my sincere thanks to them, coUectively and individually.
To the masters commanding the merchant ships Result, AbduUah, Alabama, Madge Wildfire, Dakotah, Fairlie, Hydree, Mirzapore, Melbourne, Merse. Maria Grey, Arthur the Great, Rajah of Cochin, Clifton, Thames City, Wansfield, Scindian, Bombay, Rhoderic Dhu, Philo, and SibeUa, aud their officers and crews, especiaUy to tbe Commander of the Result, Captain Cow, wlhose kind and considerate.conduct in bringing off the wounded did him honour, I tender my best thanks for their active exertions. Al did their duty, and vied with each other, day and night, which ship should do the most in landing the troops, horses, and stores.
In conclusion, may I again request your Lordship's notice of the gallant officers who have given me so much assistance and support during the time I have been fitting out the Persian Gulf Expedition. By their exertions nearly 10,000 persons, with all their camp equipage, p rovisions, guns, and stores, and 1,10 horses, have been landed on the sbores of Persia, without the slightest accident, and, with the exception of five horses, without a casualty of any sort; and by to-morrow evening the- troops wil have their tents pitched, cooking things ready, and every arrangement to give them comfortand shelterfromthecoldweatherandrainsofthe winter. The Indian navy being a service of seniority precludes promotion, and, unlike their brethren of the army, they can gain nothing of advancement to a higher rank, but if in bringing to the notice of your Lordsbip in Council their meritorious conduct upon this as well as every otber occasion I have the good fortune to render a service to those who have so thoroughly done their duty, it will be a source of the greatest gratification to me.
I have the honour to be, my Lord, your Lordship's humble and obedient servant,
HENRY J. LEEKE,
Rear-Admiral, 1RN., Commander-in-Chief, I.N.,
and Commanding the Naval Force Persian Gulf Expedition.
From Commander Felix Jones, LN., Political Agent with
the Forces, and Resident in the Persian Gulf, to H L. Anderson, Esq., Secretary to Government of B,ombay:Residency in the Persian Gulf, Busbire, Dec. 13, 1856.
Sir,-My last despatoh made known my retirement from Bushire. I now continue the report of my proceedings to the present date in connexion with the expeditionary force in this Gulf.
2, On the 29th of November a detachment of the fleet (Feroze steam-frigate, towing two merchant ships, and corvette Falkland) first hove in sight of Bushire, and dis. pelled the prevaihng idea that the force would not quit the shores of India. This illusion I had been able to maintain perfect to the last moment, though the object I had contemplated of an immediate descent on the coast failed, from the fleet being scattered in various parts of the Gulf. It w-aF
not, indeed, until the 6th inst. that they were sufficiently cellected to admit of direct operations being commenced;
but in the meantime the Island of Karrack was occupied and formed into a military depot, as reported in my despatch to Major-General Stalker, under date of the 4th inst.
3. The day subsequent to the arrival of the first ships the Governor of Bushire wrote to me officiaUy on the subject of the display before the town; but, as I was then about proceeding to meet the General some miles offat sea, an answer to his inquiries was delayed, as shown in the
accompanying letters. On the 3d of December the Governor-General's proclamations were sent to him officiaUy, with the sanction of the Major-General Commanding the Forces. To these there was no reply.
4. On the 6th inst. the fleet moved down to Halilla Bay, which Commodore Ethersey had pronounced the best suited
for the debarcation of the force, and no spot could havo been better selected. Dispositions were made for landing the force on the following morning, when it was effected in admirable order, though not unobserved by the enemy, small parties of whom were driven from their lurking places in the date groves by the fire of the gunboats and well-
directed shot from the steam-frigate Ajdaha, commanded by Lieutenant Worsley.
5. Shortly after noon the force was enabled to advance from the beach and take up an extended front before the enemy, seen at intervals watching our movements, a few miles in advance. Great difficulties, however, had to be contended with in landing the cavalry horses and artillery equipage from a paucity of-nativi boats wbhichI bad failed
in procuring from the Aralb coasts, owlng to the impractihability of dealing with the people in moments of emergency and need. These difficulties were, however, readily xurmounted by the skill and activity of the Indian naval officers and men, whose exertions on tljis occasion merit the highest praise. These exertions were fully appreciated by their associates in arms, not less active in their endeavours to get at the enemy with the least possible delay.
6. Forty.eight hours sufficed to put the troops in motion northward, the ships of war, led by the Admiral, advancing along the coast to their support. This was on the morning of the 9th, and by noon the enemy were observed to be in some force in the village of Rushire. Here, amid the rmins of old houses, garden walls, and steep ravines, thoy occupied a formidable position; but, notwithstanding their firm. ness, wal after vlaU was surmounted, and finally they were driven from their last defence (the old fort of Rushire), bordering on the cliffs at the margin of the sea. This was carried at the point of the bayonet, the enemy then only flying in despair down the cliffs, where many met their death in their eudeavours to escape through the ravines of the south. The nature of the ground, however, rendered pursuit difficult to the horse, though many were cut up in a chase of some distance. Details of this spirited affair will be given by the proper officers; I shall therefore merely observe that the enemy received at first a lesson he will not readily forget, for the tribe families of Dashti and Tungestoon comprising its ranks are regarded as the most brave as well as the mo st skilled in the defence of posts like Rushire, where regular troops cannot work with full effect. Brigadier Stopford, C.B., met his death here, and other loss was experienced. The wounded were received into the ships the same evening, and provisions were thrown into the camp from seaward during the night.
7. It had been agreed that I should proceed in person to the town of Bashire, in a small steamer, with a flag of truce, bearing the accompanying copy of a summons to surrender, with the terms offered to the garrison. While the above was enacting, I proceeded on this errand with the humane object also of receiving such of the merchants and townspeople as might be desironus of s'helter in the fleet. This was quite in accordance with the wishes of the Government of India in regard to the inhabitants of Bushire; and the Major-General, the Admiral, and myself were induced to believe that my presence near them might tend to avert much bloodshed. In this, however, we were disappointed, for on passing through the intricate channel leading to the town two batteries, at a distance of 500 yards, opened upon the Assyria, bearing the flag of truce, in defiance of aU usage of war. Deeming it might be a mistake, I caused the vessel to stop, but a second and a third shot passing close to us, I was compelled to retrace my steps, and even then two more guns were discharged. I could scarcely account for this conduct, having taken some pains to explain the meaning of a flag of truce, in the event of warfare, before quitting the town; but, while relating the circumstance to 'ear-Admiral Sir Henry Leeke, a flag of truce from the shore was reported, and the bearer (tirza Ismail, Collector of Customs in the town) came off with a written apology from the Go. vernor, who, with the chief officers of the garrison, was Stated to have been outside of the walls examining into the condition of the exterior defences at the tine ; every regret was expressed; the act was attributed to the ignorance of an artilleryman, with hopes that it would be overlooked. To this the Admiral and myself replied that,so far as we were personally concerned, we were willing to credit the statements of the Governor and accepted the apology, tbough the act itself, in whatever way originating, must stigmatize the Persian Government and its officers in the eyes of all civ ili7ed States. Mirza Ismail returned with a summons to the shore.
8. While this was going on a note from the Major-General Commanding announced his intentions of advancing on the town the following morning, and the Admiral disposed his fleet in order of battle, for first dismantling the newly. erected outworks,and then moving with a view to breaching the south waU of the town. The foUowing morning, as the tide served, the ships were in the positions assigned them. A second flag of truce had come off begging 24 hours' delay, but this was promptly rejected, and at near 8 o'clock the signal was hoisted to engage. Shot and sheU were aimed at the redoubt south of the town, but with little effect, owing to the great range, though eventually the enemy assembled there to oppose the troops were dislodged, and beat a retreat with their guns into the town. The ships, in the meantime, bad moved upon the town, and such was the ardour displayed to get closo in to the works that every ship was laid aground at the turn of high water, and for four hours continued to cannonade the defences, which were active in replying the whole time. Many of their guns, however, were not of sufficient calibro to reach the ships, but the perseverance of the Persian gunners in firing from the more heavy pieces was admired by every one. Their shot told very often on the hulls of the Victoria, FaLkiand, Semiramis, and Feroze, which latter vessels, under Captain John Young and Commander James Rennie (if comparisons are admissible where all exorted themselves alike), had the posts of honour for the day. Details of the affair it is unnecessary for me to enter upon. It will suffice for me to report that, some of the guns b'eing silenced on the approach of the army, under Major-General Stalker, C.B., to breach the waU on the gate side before assault, the Persian flagstaff was feUed in token of submission. This was at noon. The Persian flag has since been recovered by myself, and presented as a joint trophy to the chiefs conducting the combined operations in this expedition, who, with every officer and man in it, whether soldier or sailor, have certainly won for themselves an hononrable name.
9. After surrender, some little hesitation was shown on the part of the governor and garrison to come out of the town; an assuring note, coupled with the threat of an assault in half an hour, was, however, sent in by a freed captive; and on the expiration of the time that officer was seen issuing with his suite from the gate. I moved forward with a party to receive and conduct him to head-quarters where, after tendering his sword, he met with a gracious reception from the Major-General and Rear-Admiral commanding the forces. Shortly afterwards the Sirhaug, or Lieutenant-Colonel and Commandant, submitted, the entire garrison at the same time laying down their arms on my proceeding into the town with assurances of safety from the Major-General Commanding-in-Chief. The British colours were then hoisted at 4.30 p.m. on the Residence Flagstaff by Lieutenant Clarkson of the Indian navy, the troops under orders to garrison the town moving at sunset into the place.
10. Since the occupation I have been engaged with my assistant, Lieutenant Disbrowe, in giving confidence to the townspeople, securing the magazines, granaries, and other public stores, endeavouring to reopen the bazaars, and in adocting measures for the public safety, as well as in taking steps for obtaining supplies. Owing to the distrgst naturally prevailing among suspicious people, quite new to us, and generally ignorant as to our usages and inbtitutions, we have some difficulty to con'end with. Time, however, will aid to dispel fears, to restore confidence, and eventually, I hope, secure to us all we require. I must not conccal, however, that our chief local supplies of fresh meat, grain, c., must be drawn from Ba'sorai and Bagdad, and boats are not readily procurable. A large quantity of coal should therefore be stored, both here and at Bassoralb, for the use of steamers, those of small size being best adapted for this service; they should not fail us, for, in any case, to insure cattle hving the voyage should he shortened as much as possible by their tak;ing beats in tow.
11. No intelligence of any kind has come in from the interor; but I may be able to glean some in a few days. All is, however, quet in the town and districts at the present time.
12. I beg to enclose a copy of a proclamation, with appended articles, which forms the basis of our future administration in these tracts. These will doubtless require emendation as w e progress in the government of a strange people; but they seem to me at present best adapted to worlc upon, and have zocordingly received the sanction of the Major-Geoneral Commanding -in- Chief of the Force.
I have the honour to be, &;c.,

To THE GOVERNOR OF THE Towxy AND DISRICTS o0
Anxious to save Bnslhre from the horrors of war, and togive to its non-conibatants, women, and children ample time to escape from its wals, the Sirdar General Sahib and the Sirdar Admiral Sabib, commanding the English combined n,ilitary and naval forces before the town, have, to the present time, refrained from bombarding it, otherwise the powerful ships of the British Goverunsent could have id it in ashes in the siort space of two hours. The dictates of humanity having therefore been complied with, tba wi
no ]onger delay, unless the Governor, seeing the tity of ppposition, prodently surrender the town into their hands.
The Governor is given until to-mnorrow morning at sunrise to consider his position, when, should lie determie onr surrender, the topmast of the Persiana overnment flagstaff at the chetar Boorj must be struck as the signal of submission.
The Sirdar General Sabib and the Sirdar Adhtiral Sahib, Commanding, &c., offer the following conditions in case of noni-resistance and honourable capitulation:
Private property of all desriptions, including dwellinghouses, will be scrupulotanly respected, but public property of every kind, with the contents of granaries, magazines, and public buildings, including arms, amtumunition, and public treasures, must be transferred, with official lista,

India And China.
INDIA AND CHINA.
TA portion of the following appeared In oar second ed', on of ywterday:-]
By the arrival of the Overland Mail we have received our private correspondence and files of papers from Bombay to the 2d of January; Calcutta, 221 December; and Hongkong, 15th of December.
INDIA.
The following is the letter of our Calcutta correspondent, dated December 22:-
" As I expected, Sir John Bowring, Plenipotentiary in Ohina, has applied to the Government of India for troops. He intends, it is said, to keep Canton as a material guarantee for the observance of the treaty of 1847, and requires regiments to garrison the town. I question if ho wiU obtain them. With a Persiana war on its hands and an expedition beyond the frontier still possible the Government cannot spare Europeans. Native troops may be sent from Madras, but there are no steamers to convey them, and the voyage at this time of the year vill be very tedious. The Ceylon Rifles and the regiment at Singapore will probably be aUowed to go, but Sir John Bowring must raise troops for himself. There are plenty of men to be had in the Archipelago. A Malay, with or without diseipline, can always thrash a Chinese, and the Customs of Canton will supply the necessary funds. The feeling in this country as to the attack on Canton is one of unqualified approval. Anglo-Indians are too much accustomed to Orientals to believe that argument has any efficacy unless backed by an over*whelming display of force. The doctrine, too, that v-e must advance whether we like it or not has a firm hold on the public mind, and Sir John Bowring is for the present very decidedly popular. It is an odd fact that we should for the second time be at war with Persia and China at once. The bombardment has scarcely affected the opium market. There has been a slight fall, but the fluctuation is not greater than occurs at every opium sale. In fact, the price of the drug depends more upon the time bargains made in Calcutta than on any events in China itself.
".Nothing has yet been heard on this side of India of the Persian expedition. The delay which has occurred is considerable, and creates some anxiety. You will, however, doubtless have received from Bombay the latest intelligence from the Gulf. The only fact of importance from the frontier is thatDostMahomed meets SirJohnLawrenceat Peshawur. This is remarkable. It is not usual even in Asia for a Sovereign to meet an envoy out of his own dominions, and the concession, if accurately reported, indicates that the Ameer is hardly pressed. It seems to be believed that he will ask for troops. Brigadier Chamberlain's force, after approaching almost within sight of Cabul, returned, greatly to its owvn surprise. The expedition has, however, performed a moat important function. It has demonstrated the existence of a new and comparatively accessible route to Cabul. It is called the route bythe Kurrum VaUey, and has been carefully and even minutely explored. The final determination of Governmeut appears to be still uncertain. It is excessively unwilling to despatch troops beyond the frontier, but still contemplates that movement as an annoying possibility.
" The domestic event of the fortnight is the introduction of the penal code into the Legislative Council. It has not yet been published, but it is understood that it abolishes all existing criminal laws, and is in substance, though not in detail, the measure prepared by Mr. Macaulay. It is believed that it will be passed vwithout much further discussion, and India be finaly rid of Mahommedan and Regulatior Law. I hope in my next communication to send you a sketch of its principal provisions. Its irmediate effect will be to impart some consistency to the criminal decisions of the judges. At present, as you are aware, the common law of India is the Koran, as interpreted by various doctors. That law, already overburdened with commentary, is further encumbered by some hundreds of acts passed by the Legislature, and some thousands of ' constructions' or precedents established by the Sudder Court. The body of law thus created is so great as to demand a special training. Indian judges have practically no training at all. The ablest judge of the AppeUate Court, for instance, has never been on the bench, and has enjoyed but limited opportunities of legal study. He is a good judge-that is he administers sound justice, but he as often walks over a precedent as not. The code will at least afford these officers some definite rtde by which they may ordinarily be guded. The other day the Sudder or Appellate Court formally decided that if the Darogah or head constable declared a prosecution unfounded the magistrate had no further power of inquiry. The decisiou startled the entire country, and three weeks after it was formally upset by two other judges of the same court. Both precedents are at this moment valid, and this on a point which affects the entire practice of every criminal court in Bengal. Such a state of affairs cannot be permitted to endure, but the Government waits for the penal code.
" The law permitting the re-marriage of widows has been carried into effect. Pundit Greeschunder Surma, a Koolin of Koolins, a man of the very highest sacerdotal ranL-, has married the widow of a pundit of equal birth. The ceremoony was attended by hundreds of Brahmins, and created a profound sensation. There has been some talk of excommunicating all concerned; but so extreme a step is imnprobable, for this reason among others-if the orthodox excommunicate the guilty couple they must excommunicate every Hindoo who attended the wedding. They will do nothing so dangerous, and the prohibition may be considered finally abolished. I am told that some degree of coercion was exercised on the bridegroom, but Eindoos invariably account for their defeats in that fashion. Even if true, the fact wil make no difference. A Koolin has married a Koolin widow. He has not been excommunicated. Anybody, therefore, may marry a widow -without fear of consequences. This result is admitted by the most bigoted opponents of the reform, so there is an end of one of the oldest social evils that ever afflicted a community. The bride in this case was a girl of about 12. Under the ancient system she must have remained single al her life, an object of perpetual anxiety to her family.
"The Government has recently taken another step in the direction of social reform. It is even more daring than the last. The Santhals have at ]ast completely settled down. Their harvest this year will be splendid, all debts were paid by the insurrection, and the zemindars would as soon try to oppress tigers. The military police has been organized, and there is little apparent danger of a new outbreak. It is fel, however, that there is no permanent security for the Damun till the savages have been civilized. The Government, therefore, has handed the whole race over to the Church Miionary Society. Teachers are to be selected by them, and responsible to them alone, the State finding the funds. Schoolhouses, boarding-schools, books, and money for travelling are all to be provided by Governnent, but administered by the Society. The minsionries yre free to teach any creed they please, and At is understoodthough not stated-ti&t attendance in the schools will be pretty rigidly enforced. Mr. Droese, the Society's agent in Bhazulpore, is a man of some energy; and the Santhals have no creed, no caste, and rather a respect than otherwise for Christianity. It is not therefore improbable that
in a generation the savages who recently deW.Aated Beecbhoom may be an educated, civi-
lized tribe of Christians. No prejudice has bxeen excited among the Hindoos. They hold a Santhal to be about as important as a rat, aid, if they have any feeling at all, it is one of pazsive surprise that Government did not put the whole tribe to death. The same plan is ;aid to have been tried by Lord Dalbousie in Cachar. I never heard of it, but my informant can-
not be mistaken, and the acts of Government in tIose far-away jungles seldom reach the public.
"I enclose the misionaries' petition -to Parliament. It has been rejected by the Government of
India, partly because the inquiry would be a cause of disturbance, partly becawe it onsiders itself already well informed. The petition is probably somewhat too wide in terms. It apparently includes political as well as social questions. The missionaries, however, as Ihave told you, are not Radical&. They
waut only to remedy social evils-the insufficient ood, clothing, profits, and iersonal freedom left to th tiUers of the EOi3. Of the grave reasons whioh exist for this petition I win
g-v6 0I b6le instance. IUnder egulation 7 of
1$1 ;e landholder has the power to comIel'
teiapt , for any pulrpose onnected with their
$ attend bt his hou . By construction 3ftliE'Sddor Court refused to define the degree of
compulsi4on which might be legally exercised. In
practice, therefore, a landholder may summon his tenant to attend him whenever and wherever 4e li;es under penalty of any amount of punishmeqt he has the power to inflict. Imagine ,an English Peer with that power over every tenant and labourer on an estate including the entire county. Imagine that Peer, a man without Christianity to restrain him, with an army of Guards, all foreigners, and a direct and permanent interest in extortion. That is only one of the la Ns into which inquiry is 'unadvisable.'
"Further measures have been adopted to open the navigation of the Mutlah. Six pilots have been placed upon the river. A Custom-house has been established on the point nearest to Calcutta. The Government lots are being cleared for the site of the new city. The merchants are erecting sheds in all directions on the opposite side, ana land hitherto regarded as an encumbrance has risen to an appreciable value. The engineer of the SouthEastern Railway has arrived, and has reported favourably of the facilities for connecting the river with Calcutta, and vessels begin already to flock to the new port. In truth, the trade of Calcutta increases too fast for the Hooghly. The river literally cannot hold the shipping. The moorings have been extended miles beyond the business centre of the town, and can be extended no further, while accidents from overcrowding are of daily occurrence. In connexion with this subjeet I may add some statistics just published by theFrd of India. The figures represent the value of bullion imported into Bombay and Bengal in the last five years. The demand, as you know, does not diminish. It is not my province to reason on the advantages of a gold currency, but you may rely on this fact-the native prejudice throughout India is in favour of a gold currency:

; (PROI Otm OVM CORRESPONDENT.)
HONGKONG, DEC. 15.
The London mail of the 10th of October arrived here on the 1st instant, per steamer Norna, which leaves again to-day with the outward mai;ls.
Affairs at Canton have undergone but slight alteration since we last wrote, it being apparently Sir Michael Seymour's policy to hold his present position until he receives from home replies to his despatches by last maiL
On the 15th of November Captain Foote, of the United States ship Portsmout}, was on his way from Whampoa to Canton in the ship's pinnace, for the purpose of withdrawing the American Marines stationed in the foreign factories, when, in passing the Barrier Forts, the boat was fired at by the Chinese, and obliged to put back to Whampoa, notwithstanding the American flag was flying at the time, and was also waved from the boat, so that there might be no mistake. The American men-of-war Portsmouth and Levant immediately moved up the river and bombarded the forts, which the Chinese defended bravely, replying with a well-directed fire, killing two men and wounding others, and doing some damage to the vessels. Commodore Armstrong then wrote to the Viceroy demanding an apology within 24 hours. The reply being unsatisfactory, the Americans at once proceeded to take the forts, which they have since destroyed. In this service several lives were lost. Since this took place Yeh has written to the A merican authorities to say that their flag shall be respected, and that it was entirely a mistake which led to the late misunderstanding. There are yet [one or two small points at issue, but we understand
that the Americans will accept this apology, and withdraw from Canton. I enclose a copy of a letter from his Excellency Dr. Parker to the United States Consul at Canton relative to this matter:-
Legation of the United States, Macao, Dec. 9,1856.
"Sir,-A despatch from Commodore James Armstrong, of yesterday's date, informs me that on the 6th inst. the demolition of the Barrier Forts was completed, and the ships had returned to their anchorage at Whampoa, and in a few days the damages to the vessels wfill be repaired. En. closing me copies of the correspondence with the Imperial Commissioner, he observes, 'Here I presume it wi end, and so long as he (the Imperial Commissioner) does not commit any act of violence against our flag or citizens we shall rest on our arms.' His Exeellency Yeh in a despatch of the 5th instant writes Commodore ArmstrongI From this I see your Excellency has a clear knowledge of affirs. There is no matter of strife between our two nations. Henceforth let the fashion of flag which American ships employ be clearly defined, and inform me what it is beforehand-this will be the verification of the friendly relations between our countries.'
"I have this day resumed correspondence with the Imperial Commissioner, demanding attention to various important subjects, which I had chosen to place in abeyance pending the adjustment of the naval question; among them, other instances in which the United States' flag has been fired upon by the Chinese, and the rights of the United States' citizens under treaty have been brought to his Excellency's notice, who has been inforned that, failing to render the satisfaction demanded for the violation of the treaty by the forts of Heang-shan, that matter also will be delivered over to the Commander-in-Chief of the United States naval forces in China to manage. This brief expos6 of the present state of our relations with the Chinese Government at this port you are authorized to communicate for the information of United States' citizens within your consular jurisdiction.
Respectfufly, your obedient servant,
"PETER PARKER." " 0. H. Perry, Esq., United States' Consul, Canton."
In our last we announced the capture of the Bogue Forts, wlhich have since been dismantled and blown up. Blenheim Reach Fort was taken on the 26th of November by Her Majesty's steamer Barracouta without loss. The French Folly, which the Chinese had reoccupied, was attacked on the 4th inst., and carried, with the loss of one man killed and two wounded on our side. The fort was immediately mined and blown up; Shameen Fort has also been entirely destroyed by gunpowder. Two magazines in the city have been blown up by our shells from the Dutch Folly, and several fires have broken out, causing considerable damage.
We regret to have to announce the death of Captain Cowper, R.E., who was killed by the falling of a beam while he was engaged in pulling down the Chinese buildings in the neighbourhood of the factories.
His Excellency Sir John Bowring passed a week in Canton, during which timee he ad some correspondence with the Viceroy, which is published in the Government Garcite.
The Plenipotentiaries and Naval Commanders-in. Chief of Great Britain and America have held a conference in Canton, but there have been no results of importance.
The rebels have latterly gained sOme successes in the Canton province, which must embarrass the Imperialist calice very materialy, The large town of Sing Yuen, situate onthe river, about 40 miles above Canton, has fallen into their hands, and numerous bands of bandits are1 ravaging the surrounding country, from which the troops have been withdrawn for concentration at Canton.
In the river below Canton there is a large number of rebel or pirate boats, but Admiral Seymour has given them to understand that no interference will be permitted while he holds the river.
Her Majesty's steamer Sampson has beea cruising around fongkong, and has destroyed a number of pirate boats which had assembled in those waters, levying black-mail, and all but preventing supplies reaching the colony from the mainland. Piracy appears on the increase on the coast
and somewhat formidable fleets are cruising about. Admiral Seymour is aware of this, and doubtless they will receive a check ere long.
The Imperial Commissioner Yeh has shown no signs of submission, but the Mandarins and Chinese merchants are very desirous of a settlement, which, however, there appears little prospect of at present.
Two companies of Her Majesty's 59th Regimbnt are quartered in Canton.
In Hongkong there has been considerable excitement among the Chinese popation, which at one time assumed a very serious character. The rigorous and ill-judged administration of a new " nuisance ordinance" prepared by the Attorney-General, and carried out under his especial direction, coupled with the very reprehensible conduet of the police, so alarmed the respectable Ohinese that they closed
tiheir shops 'and convened a meeting, with the iten- I
r tion of memorializing Governmuent, This waa taken I
advantage of by some of the evil-disposed, and at!I one time very serious results wore apprehended. l I The milithry were called out, and the principalI
Chinese being alsured of protectioul reopened their'
shops, and waited on the Lieutenant-Governor to explain the grievances of wrhich they-cn;plained*- Governmnent have laid great stress on the action of emissaries from Canton, but the real causes of the disturbance are too well known in the colony.
Trade is entirely suspended at Canton, aud nearly all the foreign residents have left the place for Macao and Hongkong, where a few sales of cotton are all that we have to report.

From Shanghai our latest advices are to the 6th inst. The political news is unimportant. The derangement in the currency had an injurious effect oa trade. Carolus dollars are not procurable, and sycee silver, at fluctuating rates, is used as the prDncipal medium.
Shirtings had been disposed of to a moderate extent at slightly improved rates, but the decline in exchange neutralizes the advantage.
Raw silk had advanced considerably previous to the receipt of telegraphic intelligence of the 26th of September, when a reaction took place, but quotations are still much higher than last month-say, Tsatlee No. 1-2, none; middling to fair, $280 to $315; inferior to niddinig, $250 to $270; arrivals, 87,000 bales; settlements, 61,000 bales; stock on the market, 6,000 bales. The export of silk from all China to Great Britain amornts to 49,50;) bales, against 26,200 at the same period last wason; and to Marseilles, 6,700 bales, against 2,800 bales; givng a total increase of about 27,200 bales.
Black teas had advanced fully 2 taels per picul, and the settlements for the month amounted to 36 chops. Only 40 chops new tea had arrived, and it is confidently stated that not more than 100 chops will arrive this season. Green teas were 2 to 3 taels higher, and were freely taken.

Foochow letters are to the 8th inst. Tea had advanced i to 1 tael per picul. All the finer kinds of Congou are long since exhausted, and even the common grades are now becoming scarce, and are eagerly purchased. Oolongs are 1 to 2 taels higher.
Settlements for the month amount to 45,000 chests of Congou, 600 chests of Souchong, and 24,000 half-chests of Oolong. The remaininog stock is very small. Two vessels had Failed for Great Britain.
A short export of tea from China has been frequently predicted, but we have never known such a strong probability of its realization as this season, with a present export of only 36k millions, Canton completely closed, and very small supplies expected at the other ports.

BOMBAY MARKET.
(From the Bomboay ninzee of Jan. 2.)
The overland mail from London of the 26th November reached Bombay on the morning of the 22d December, per Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamship Pekin.
Our money-market during the fortnight has, contrary to expectation, become much tighter, and the banks have again raised their rates of interest 1 per cent. all round.
We have to announce a further decline in Government securities; also, that the better class of joint-stock shares remain at about former quotations,
JIPORTS.
Cotton Piece Goods.-The market shows the same active feeling as at the date of last report, and transactions are made for all countries except Persia. A better prospect is gradually opening, and dealers are clearing fair profits. (.ray longeloths have remained in a dull state: 7 lb. goo s have fetched 2r. 15a. to 3r. 4a. ; others higher rates. Gray domestics are in very little demand, in consequence of the present hostilities with Persia, and stocks are accumulating. Gray jaconots have advanced in value, and 10 to 12 pick goods are reported to be scarce. There is stil a faling off in the imports of this article. Gray shirtings, both 40 and 45 inch goods, 61b. and 7 lb., are in demand, as also 5.1 and 5.l1b., 40 inch goods. Gray Aadapollams have for somue time been depressed, on wvhich account importers had to turn their attextion to other goods; there is, however, a little improvement perceptible, and our present quotations are expected to rise. Gray T-cloths, 71b., are in fair inquiry ; 6 lb. are dull.
Bleached and Fancy Goods.-Bleached jaconots, low and middling, have been sold at advanced prices, and aro frequently in inquiry. Bleached shirtings are dull, and no sales have transpired during the fortnight. Bleached Madapollams are dull, and no high prices can be expected.
.appes, low qualities, are scarce; coloured lappets are selling at fair prices. Dhotiee, both gray and bleached, are improving, but no noticeable sales have been reported. In ook niuslins no improvement in value is worth report, ing, and stocks are heavy.
Cotton Yarns-There is a very great demand for Turkey red; orange is very dull, and green is inquired for. Of both mule and water twists sales have been litited, but the prices continue firm.
Metals.-Tin plates, steel (in tubs), lead, and spclter have advanced in price. Iron is in fair demand ; both Swedish and British bar may be quoted at former prices. In copp- r there have been large sales made.
Cochineal.-The market continues in a favourable state, and moderate supplies will be acceptable.
Marine Stores.-Cauvass is in fair inquiry. Cordage aud twine are in very little demand.
EXPORTS.
Cotton Wool.-There is great change to be noted in the prices. Shipments to Europe have been made on a large scale, but they have consisted principally of goods previously contracted for. We quote Dhollera, old and new, at 115r. to ll7r.; Oomrawuttee at 110r. to 114r.; Compta at 112r. ; sawginned, 120r. to 122r.; and cutch at l1Or. to 112r.
Oil Seeds.-Linseed and rape have both advanced in prices. Pepper.-Little attention is paid to this article, aad the value has fallen by two rupees per candy.
Opium.-The steamer Cadiz, that started yesterday morning, carried about 1,591 chests for Chinese porte. We quote Mundleseer at 1,030 rs., and Indore at 1,020 rs. The market at present may be said to wear a dull appearance.
Tonnage.-In consequence of Government taking snore vessels for the transport service, the rates have advanced to 31. per ton for Liverpool and London, and now continue firm. The rates for China are uominal.
Exchange has continued steady at about last niail's ra4eviz., 2s. 2jd. for first class paper, and 2s. 2nd. to 2s. 2.,a
for local credits and documents. The large imnport of trelasre (430,OO ) by the last xteamer from Europe h s not had the effect of lowering our quotationg, chiefly perbaps on account of the Mint being shut since the 24th December for the holydays.
Calcutta, sight, par; Madras, 30 days' sight, 98 ; China, 0 days' sight, 212.
CALCUTTA MfARKET.
(From the Calcatia Engliehman of Dec. 22.)
The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamship Nubia having broken her shaft on her vay trom Suez, did not arri ve here with the London mall of the 10th ult. till the 16th inst., and her packets were delivered the following day. The steamship Ava, belonging to the same Company, also arrived, vid the Cape, on the 16th inst., having left Soathampton on the 1st October last. Mr. Lindsay's screw oteamer Tynemouth, which Ii t England about the beginning of September last, has not made her appearance yet.
Though our produce market during the past fortnight has not been characterized by much activity, we have set had a fair amount of transactions in the principal staples, and in some instances enhanced prices have ruled. Our indigo sales have progressed satisfactorily, some well-known marks having been dispoped of at full figures. In sugar little has been done for the home markets, the active demand on the part of the Bombay buyers still continuing. Saltpetre has been in better request, v,ith an upwiard tendency. In raw silk we have no transactions to report, but coralis have at. tracted attention in consequence of the concession mnade by holders. Hides command extreme rices, upplies falling greatly short of the demind. Jute has been in excellent iequest, and, arivals from the interior proving moderate, bolders have succeeded in establishing a considerable advance in value. Oil seeds are easier, tho demand for America
having given way. In the other articles we have hardly I any change to notice.
Soon alter the departure of the last mail much inactivity prevailed in our if port market, but during the past week a
etter feeling has eeu obseeved, ad, though we can hardly notice any' improvemeat in the {ue of goods, native dewlers bave displayed more willingness to operate. In British cotton piecet goods the transactions have bcn on a fair scale. Gray shirtings have sold freely, i3 lso gray jaconots and Madapollams. A better busisstig haa been dgne in Turkey
'.red goods, and ve hare had an improved inquiry for white mnule twist, but without as yet leading to any advance in iprioes, The-metal markethas sarcely undergone any change bTut holders have continued firm. Oar supplies of British cotton piece goods of late have been rather abandant, bat importers having displayed much firmness and declined to accede to any concessions, combined with rather favoxrable advices from the UJpper and North-Western Provinces, the market has assumed a healthier tone, and a decidedimprovement is shortly looked for.
Money Market.-Although the bank rates of interest and discount remain unaltered, we observe in the bazaar indications of money getting dearer, and capitalists less inclined to advance on terms hitherto prevailing. A large sam besides is locked up in opium, and to get their immediate wants satisfied borrowers are obliged to submit to higher rates.
.We hear of considerable sums being advanced against shipments of opium at S per cent. per annum, and, though this high rate might bave been paid under peculiar ciroeumstances, and may not be considered as a criterion, we observe symptoms of the market getting gradually less easy. The specie shipments to Akyab, of which but a small amount has gone forward as yet in comparison with the sum total required for the exportation of rice from that port, bave already begun to tell unon the amount of cash in the Bank of Bengal. The last published statement for the week ending on the 17th instantshows a decrease of 7,22,239r. as compared with the statement of the 3d instant.
Shares.-One or two transactions are reported in th;s market at almost the samie figures as ruled a fortnight ago, and we have therefore no need to alter our quotations,
Government Securities.-We continue to observe much want of confidence both among capitalists and dealers, arising, no doubt, from the uncertainty as to the financial operations of Government. The fortnight under roview has not-passea without a certain amount of transactions in securities, but the sum total of those transactions we confi ss has been very trifling. A further depreciation in the ealue of all descriptions of paper has taken place, especially of the Five per Cent., though not to any extent. Company's Foars'have changed hands at 16-Sr. to 16-12r. ; Sicca Fours, at 17-Sr. to 18r., but of the latter we have little in the market. The Five per Cents., of which there are fev aellers, have declined to 1 per cent. premium. Stock Receipts are quoted nominally at llr. to 12r. per cent. ; and the Three-and-a-Half per Cents, at 35r. per cent. discount,
Exchange.-On London, after the close of the last msail, business commenced at 2s. 2nd. for credits, at which transactions to a very fair extent took place, but, as the supply of paper wasrather large, sellers submitted to slightly higher rates, and sales were made at 2s. 2,1d. per rupee, bat the market closed in favour of sellers. Some hills also drawn in China on London, received by the Lancefield, were placed at 2s. 2 7-16d. We quote document bills at 2s. 2.d. to 2s. 2td.; post and Treasury bills at 2s. ld. per rapee.
Fresg ts.-Since the departure of the last mail considerable sativity has prevailed in the market, and a pretty fair amount of tonnage disposed of. For London. lare shipments of rice are going forward at 31. 10s. to 31. 17s. a.
and for Liverpool at 3S. 5s. to 3. 7s. 6d. For America some business has been done at $11. per ton.

The plainti in this appeal -as a market gardener and florist at Sands-end, Pihtain, and sought by his bill a perIetual injunction against the defendants to restrain them from manufacturing gas in certain retort-houses adjoining his premises, on the ground that his vegetables, &c., were iin.uriously aflected therehy. Vice-Chancellor Wood granted the prayer of the bill, and the company appealed to this Court. 'The case was heard before
e Lord Chancellor some time back, and stood over for judgment. In consequence, however, of his LordFhip enertaining sonne doubt wbether the case was not within the 6Sth section of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, it was reargued upon tbht point before his Lordship, 'aho caUled in the assistance of MJr. Justice Crompton and Mlc. Justice Willes. The section in question provides a remedy for property " injuriously affected"-namely, compensation to be awarded by a jury; and, therefore, if the present case canie within its operation the bill had been improperly filed.
J. jubtico NVILL-5 this morming read the joint opinioa of himpelf and Mr. Justice Croipton, to the effect that, although the L%nds Clauses Consolidation Act was incorporated with the speciAl act of the defendants, the injury in the present case was one not authorized to be done by law, and was not therefore within the statutory remedy. The right for the plaintiff to bring au action at law was still in existence, as the injury complained of was not within the scope of the special act. Although the amount of damage the plaintiff might sustain in future years was not capable of being estimated in the gross, his right to bring an action as it accrued was not taken away by the 6Sth section of the act in question, and therefore the opinion of himself and Mr. Justice Crompton was that the plaintif±Ts legal rights remained the same as if the statute had never been passed.
The LORD CRANcELLoR. said ho agreed with the opinion given by the common law judges, and therefore the only
uestion reiiiaining for him to decide was whether the evisence satisfied him that the matter had been fuUy and fairly determined by the action at law already tried, or whether there should be a new triaL Upon that question he would look through the evidence, and dispose of the case On Saturday morning. Re would, howrever, apprize the plaintiff that, in the event of the case being decided in his favour, the time for the commencement of the injunction would be extended another month, the defendants undertaking to pay whatever sum the Court might aw ard for damages.

In 1843 the son, who al along had the rnanaze ment of the farm, was put in as pro rietor of it by his father, and the father was thereapon re eased from aU ha. bility in connexion with the concern. Shortly after or just about the time of the son becoming proprietor a surn of 5001. was borrowed, for which, orst of all, the father, and then the son, at the father's request, became security. Tho father havinglatelydied, andthe500,not having been repaid, the question arose as to whether the son orthe fathor'es estate was liable for the repayment of it. The Court, after re-
iewing the affidavits, whi¢h were somewhat contradictory aud relying upon the fact of the son having troated the lo.n
shisduringthe lifetime of hisfather,and having never caUed npon his father to pay interest for it, held that the son was liable, but ordered the father's estate to bear the costs of the suit.

The plaintiff was willing that the case shonld be dlecided npon the evidence already adduced, but if the matter was sent to law he wished it to be done in the least ex;pensive form.

.n inus case an order had been made by four justices of Lancashire, ordering one Edward Crook to pay to the churchwardens of floysham tho sum of Us. 9d., being the amount of a church-rate assessed upon him, and made on the 2d of June, 1856. A rule was subsequentiy granted to quash the order, upon three grounds :-First, because the order did not show upon its face that it was a church or chapel rate; secondly, because the justices had no jurisdiction to make the order, inasmuch as it appeared by the evidence of the party complaining before the magistrates that the rate wac invalid ; and thirdly, becattso the said Edward Crook, the party summoned, disputed the validity of the rate before tho justices. In support of these objections it was stated in the affidavits that the order described the rate as a " churchwarden's rate," which, it was contended, was not a sufficient deseription of a church or chapel rate. It was alleged that the rate was invalid, because, among other grounds, it was retrospective, and was made for purposes not authorized by law. It appeared that on the 8th of February the vestry had passed a resolution authorizing the making of a rate for the repairs of the church and for other purposes therein mentioned; but the churchwardens did nothing under that resolution till their year of office expired, and thon, on the 2d of June, the rate in question was made. This rate in. cluded a sum of 81. expended since the 8th of February, and the rate was also made applicable not only to " the repairs of the church," as mentioned in the resolution adopted in February, but also I for the other necessary expenses relating to the improvement of the church." It was contended before the magistrates that this addition, together with the other objections, including the retrospective character of the rate, rendered it invalid; but tbo magistrates decided that the objections were all frivolous, and made the order for the payment of the rate. The third ground for quashing the order was, that as the validity of the rate was disputed, the magistrates, by the proviso to the 7th section of the 53d of George III., c. 127, were bound to forbear to give judgment. This was met by an affidavit made by the magistrates to the effect that the objections made to the rate were frivolous, and that the party did not bonad fide dispute the validity of the rate.
Mir. PASILEY, Q.C., Mr. ARCHBOLD, and Mr. F. X. WhiTE appeared to show cause against the rule, and contended that the order was good.
Mr. LEL HILL, Q.C. (with whom was Mr. Millward), rose to support the rale, but was stopped.
JAord CAMsBsELL said.-I am of opinion that the rule should be mado absolate. It is said the order is bad on three grounds, but with respect to two of those grounds I am not prepared to say that it ought to be quashed. The first objecEion is that tho order does not show on its face that the rate was a church or chapel rate. I think it aoes abundantly show what the rate was. The oxact words are not material. The order says this was a rate in *hich tIne party wax rated in *the churchwarden's rate." That is a distinct reference to the rate in question, and no one h%s been misled by it. There are no set words required by statue or by the common law to describe a church-rate. 'The next objection is, that the justimes had no jurisdiction to 'Iak-e the order, because the rate was shown to be invalid on the evidence of the partY complaining. I wil not give a decided opinion on any one of those questions, though some of them appear to be very foridable. But.e shtate, tbe b3d of George IIL, to. 57, provides, "That if the validity ef such rate, at the liabilNt st the person
from wbora it is demanaed to pay ie satne, 'lbe -aif. puted, and the party disputing the same give notice thereof to the justices, the justices shall forbear giving judgment tbereon, and the person or persons demanding thee'ame nay then proceed to tho recovery of their demind according to due coursEo of law, as heretofore used and accustomed." In that case the remedy would be in the Ecclesiastical Court. I thinkthe third objection is fatal to the order; for it appears that the party disputed the validity of the rate before the justices, and on grounds on
I ich he might reasonably do so. I must say tbat this rate was made in an irregular and slovenly manner, ai,d is not a precedent to be followed. It appears that on the 8th of February it was resolved that a rate of 8d. in the pound Ehould he collected. The churchwardens who were going out of office on the 25th of March, did nothing upon that resolution; but kept it in their pocket till their year of
ffilce expired, and'it was not till the 2d of June that this rate was made. I agree with the case cited to show that the resolution of vestry was an authority for the churchwardeus to make a church-rate; but they ought to follow up the authority, and make an assessment upon all who are liable, and not lie by till there has been a change of inbabitants, and, as suggested by my brotber Coleridge, a burden cast on those wbo are not liable, There are serious objections arising on the face of the rate, for it is nnade for the necessary repairs of the chureb, and for other necessary expenses relating to the improvements of the cburch. It might be said that the word "improvements" neant '*repairs," but it might also be said to incluide the erection of new galeries, or repewing the church-matters not authorized bY the resolution of the vestry. The rate also was not made till the 2d of June, after the time for the churchwardens to go out of offmce, and after they had paid the sum of 8. There was a question whether that debt of Sl. had not accrued beforo the 8th of February, wlhen the resolution of vestry was passed. That was another reasonLble ground on which the rate might have been iapeached. The question, then, i", was it impeached ' Some of the objections made were frivolous, suchas thatthesequestra. tor was not assessed for the tithe commutation rent-charge. But the magistrates had full notice that the party disputed the validity of the rate on those grounds I have t doubt the magistrates acted fairly and conscientiouiyv though not reasonably, when they said the party did not
eond fide dispute the validity of the rate; but, as I think the objections to the rate might be made by a reasonable man, the order cannot be supported, and must be quashed.
Mr. Justice COLI5BIDnO said the question was whether the party bondfide disputed the validity of the rate, and whither the objections made were other than frivolous. Sone of the objections made had been of that character, but there were others, such as that which related to the "improvements," which clearly meant something different fro'm the " repairs," which had been previously mentioned, and might include the addition of an aisle, or something else not contemplated by the resolution of vestry. lis Lordship thought the objections might fairly be made, and that the magistrates were bound under the statute to forbear to give judgment.
bIr. Justice WIGnT.NT and Mr. Justice CxOawON were of the same opinion.
Rule absolute to quash the order.
THE QUEK V. PA-ENRM
In this case a rule had been granted, calling upon Mr. Paynter, a police-magistrate of the metropolis, to show cause why he should not adjudicate upon an information laid by the Westminster Board of Works against the Gas. light and Coke Company for breaking up the pavement and opening their mains without the consent of the board, and also vhy he should not convict the conmpay in a penalty. The information was laid under the 1I0th section of the Mletropolis 3Ianagement Act (the 18th and 19th Victoria, chap. 120), when the company showed that they were actng nder apermission ivenbythe redecessors of theBoard of Works. Mr. Paynter, having heard the case on both ides, took time to consider his decision, and at length he delivered his opinion that the act had not been infringed, and that the summons must be dismLissed. Be at the same time said he was wiling to put h decision id any shape to enable the parties to ake the opinion of this Court. He was then pressed by the one party either to convict the company or to refuse to adjudicate; while, on the other. the company said he had already adjudicated by expressing his opinion that the summons ought to be dismissed. Even. tually the magistrate, still retainig his opinion, refused formally to adjudicate, in order to afford the Iord of Works an opportunity of coming to this Court for a rule under the hth section of the 11th and 12th of Victoria, chap. 44.
M1r. BOVILL, Q.C., and Mr. HUDDIXSTON took a pre. liminary objection that the act was never intended to apply to cases of the kind, vhere the magistrate had no doubt about the law, and was quite ready to give his decision; but it was intended to protect a magistrate who was called unon to do an act which might expose him to an action, where the magistrate doubted whether he ought to do the act, and hesitated upon that groumnd.
Mr. Se jeant HAYE'S and Mr. J. CrAst contended that the construction put upon the act was too narrow, and that the magistrate had onlyr expressed his opinion subject to the optnion of this Court. In a case like the l resent, where the facts were admitted, the Court would investigate the matter, and decide what judgment the magistrateoOught to
Lord CAtIrBELL said that if this rule were made absolute, the consequences would be alarming, for every petty sessions might call on this Court to adjudicate for then. In this case there had been no refusal to adjudicate. Tho mnagistrate was qtuite free to give his judgment; but at the request of one of the parties he had refused to do so. If the rule were made absolute, this Court would be made a Court of Appeal in every case, and this would lead to the degradation of the Court, for the Court would sit to give their opinion for the considcration of the justices, who might then act upon it or not, aR they thought proper. It would be more consisitent with judicial proceedings for this Court to com el the magistrates to do the act; but it was proposed that the Cousrt should give their opinion and then send the parties hack to the magistrate. None of the cases cited supported the interpretation put upon the act.
The other judges being of the same opinion, the rule was discharged, but without costs.
THE QUEEN V. WAKI.
Mr. LusIH moved for a rule to show causenvhy a quo -carranto should not issue callig upon a Mr. Wake to show by what authority he exercised the office of Registrar of the County Court of Derbyshire, held at Cbesterfield. It appeared that under the 25th section of the County Courts Act (the 9th and 10th Victoria, cap. 95), the Lord Chancellor had appointed Mr. Wake and another gentleman to exercise the office jointly. Mr. Wake's coadjutor hadlately died, and, as the appointment was to exercise the office jointly with the deceased, the appointment was nowv deter. mined by this death. The judge of the court, after consulting the Lord Chancellor, had exercised the power given him by a recent statute (the 19th and 20th Victoria), and apiointed a gentleman provisionally to be sole clerk of the court. The learned counsel said it was quite clear, from the authorities, that where the appointment was joint the death of one party determined the appointment.
Lord CAarPBELL.-YOU may take a rule to show camse.

Court Of Common Pleas, Westminster, Jan. 29.
COURT OF COMMON PLEAS, WESTMnZSTEI, JT. 29
RANSOME AND ANOTHXR V. THE EASTERN COUNTMES
RAILWAY COMPAXY.
(-SiUings in Banco, Hilary Term, bcfore tke LoBD CHIEHp
JIMstcE and Justicas CRESS WELL, CROWVDER, ancd IWILLES.)
In this case Mr. Justico CRESSW nLL, at the opening of the court, delivered judgment.-This was a rule calling upon the Eastern Counties a.ilaway Company to show cause *why a vrit of injunction should not issue against the company, enjoining them to desist from chhrging to the complainants fc r the conveyance of coals on their railways, called the Eastern Counties Railvway, the Eastern Union ailvway, and the Newmarket Railway, any greater sum per ton per mile than was charged by the said company to Messrs E. and A. Prior and Co.; secondly, to desist from charging complainant more than those with whom they had made private agreements; thirdly, to desist from giving any undue prefereace or advantage to Messrs. E. and A. Prior. It appeared from the af2idavits lsed by the respective parties that Messrs. Prior had made an agreement with the company to send a large quantiity of coals in three years froni Peterborough to various places on the lines of railvmay mentioned in the rnle, ab certain rates, to different places. The applicant, a coal merchant at Ipswich, sent coals which had been brourht to that port by sea to various places on the same lines or railway, and the company charged him a much larger sum per ton in proportion to the distance over which the coals were casried than was charged to Messrs. Prior, and it was mianifest that the sums charged to fessrs. Prior for the carriage of coal to different places were fixed so as to enable them to compete in the coal trade with Mr. Ransome, who had the advantage of having his coals brought by sea to Ipswich. Tho question which tho Court bad to determiine on this rule depended upon the construc. tion to be put upon the 17th and 18th Victoria, cap. 31, section 2, by which it was enacted " that no railway company shall make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to or in favour of any particular person or company, or any particular description of traffic; nor shaU any such conipany subject any particular person or company or any particular description of tra6tic, to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever." The first thing to be ascertained was the meaning of the expressions "Undue or unreasonable preference or advantage, and undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage.." Werc those words to be construed with refereice to the interests of the parties using the railway only, or might the interest of tho railw.ay owners be taken in any manner into consideration ? For example, if 1,000 tons were carried for a lower sum per ton per mile than 100 tons ielding an equal profit per toa to the railway comnpany, mlght they so regulate the charge as to derive such equal profit? Would the lower rate charged for the larger quantity give an undue preference ? Or, if goods could be carried 100 mies at a lower rate than 10 and yield an equal profit per ton per nuile, might the company chargPe less per mi3e for those carried 100 miles, without giving an undue or unreasonable preference ? If that might be dose without giving what the statuto called "an undue or unreasonable preference," might not the company in fixing the ratesconsider the whole profit, and not the mere profit per mnile; and in order to induce people to carry more on their line and longer distances agree to make a reduction in each ease 7 It was true that the sender of smaller quantities for a shorter distance *ould pay more per mile and more per ton in the respective casea; out would that be an undve or unreasonable
dice or disadvantage ? Again, if two railways starte from thbesame terminus and arrived at the same terminus by different routes, must they charge for the wbole line at tbe Fame rate as from immediate stations to either terminus ? For example: there were two hnaes from Portsmouth to London-the South-Western sid Bishopstoke and Winchester, and South Coa$ by lBrig)ton. Must they charge as much per mile for "assenge aDd goods from Y'ortsrnouti to London as from Winchester or Bnighiton to Londog, or might they carrY at a. lewer rate the 'whole distane, izn erder to copew 'with each other, without being, subjected to the change of imposing on the WincffioandBtighton traic an undue or 1W au"W sle disad ntas tr a good lsaLS taos.de-
ration, he (Mr. Justice Cresswell) thought that the fair in' erests of the raUway company ought to be taken into the account; and thon the questions above suggested assumed a very complicated aud difflcult cihsreter, and were such as the Court felt but littlo qualiied to decide. Nevertheless, as the Legislature had thought fit to impose on the judges of this court the duty of deali,ig with such questions, the Court must do so to the best of its ability when it became necessary. The present case was in their judgment free froux difficulties, because the differenice b-tween the rates charged to Prior and Ransoine was not founded on such considerations as had been suggested, but imianifestly on tho intention to enable Messrs. Prior, who dealt in coals brought inland from Peterborough, to compete with Rtansome, dealing in coals seaborne to Ipswichi. No such alvantage was due to them. It was therefore an undue advantage, and without deciding that a railway coul,pany may not charge different rates where coals are carried in large and small quantities, and where they are carried long and short distances, and where the difference is for the purpose of competing with another lino, the Court thought that some order must be made to prohibit the continuance of the practice now existing on the railway in question. The Court couli not say that both parties should be charged the same sum pr ton per mile, for Messrs. Prior find their own trucks, and Mr. Ransome used the trucks of the company, and it was possible that it inight cost the company more to carry over some parts of the line than others. The Court could not therefore prescribe an equal mileage rate, independent of the allo. ance for tracks, and for the same reasons the Court could not make absolute the second branch of the rule, and enjoin the company to desist front charging I'ansome any greater sum per ton per mile for the carriage of coal on their railways than they charged to persons with whom they had private agreements. But the Court thought that a writ should issue enjoining them to desist from giving an undue preferenco to Messrs. Prior, and to carry coals for Ran. some on equal terms with Messrs. Prior, having due regard to the circumstances, if any, which rendered the cost to the company of carrying for the one party less than the cost of carrying for the other. And, as the scale of charges hitherto made for carrying coals for Rfansomne manifestly jmposed upoga him an undue and nureasonlahle disadvantage, the rasiv~y company must pay the costs of the application and the vile.-Rule accordingly.
TETLEY V. EASTON AND ANOTHER.
The argument in this case, which was an action for the infringement of the patent in the centrifugal pump, was res ed to-day, Mr. Collier, Q.C., and Mr. Chance being hezrd,
The COURT took time to consider its judgment.
BnSnESS OF THE COURT.
It being known that there are a great niany motions, and no counsel appearing at 3 o'clock, at the close of the argument in the above case,
The LORD C1s1rF JUSTrCE said the Court found itself in a very great difficulty. They were always anxious to consult the convenience of the gentlemen of the bar, but there were a great many motions, and no gentlemnen of the bar were present to make any, and in all probability on the two last days of term, or even on the last day, the Court would be overwhelmed with them. If gentlemen did not come in and make their motions, and in some measure conscult theconvenience of the Court, the Court must make more stringent regulations.
'WHITE V. TIEE GREAUT W ESTERN hAILVAY COfrCNsy.
The COURT then called on Mr. Prideaux to conclude his argument in this case in sutport of a rule to set aside the nonsuit. The question raised was whether, for the nondelivery of a quantity of cheeses within a reasonable time, intrusted to the defendants to carry, and respecting which a special agreement had been entered into between the plaintiff and the defendants, the plaintiff ought to have declared on the special agreement, and not against them as common carriers.
The learned Counsel contended that this vas au action of tort founded on a breach of ditty cast on the defendants by the law, and that notwithstanding the special contract, they were still liable as common carriers for things out of the contract, and bound to deliver goods intrusted to them within a reasonable time. He also relied on the language of the Railway and Canals Traffic Act, section 7, as throwing on the Court the decision whether the terms of a special contract were reasonable or not, and contended that until this was determined the contract was an inchoate one and could not be declared upon, but was properly a matter of
lea to be set up as a defence, as liLuiting the defendants' lNabity as commaon carriers if the Court thought the terms of the contract reasonable.
The Court took time to consider its iudgment.

ENGLISH V. BLACK.
This was a special jury cause, fixed by order for trial duringterm. The hearing commenced yesterday, and having lasted aU day was resumed this morning.
Mr. Serjeaut Byles, Mr. James, Q.C., and Mr. Couch were counsel for the plaintiff; and Sir F. Thesiger and Mr. IUnthank appeared for the defendant.
The plaintiff is the superintendent of the police force of Norwich, and the defendant is chief constable of Norfolk, and this action was brought to recover damages for a libel written and published by the latter, and affecting the character of the former. The defendant pleaded " Not guity," and that the alegations contained in the aU1eged libel were trae; he also, ia his particulars, set forth facts which, if true, would excuse the publication of the slanderous matter complained of. Some time ago the plaintiff, who had been elected by the Watch Committee of Norwich head of their police force. assumed, with the sanction of such committee, the title of
'chief constable." This title the defendant, Captain Black, who was the head of the county police force, claimed for himself, and oblected to its assumption by Mr. English. Some correspondence, which it is not necessary to refer to here at greater length, took place on the subject, and at last the defendant wrote to the town clerk of Norwich a letter, from which the following is an extract:_
PI That is not the onlycause of public inconvenience of wbich I complain. Tbere Is another, whichI havc hithertoabstainedfrom aUuding to hopng itv,ould be unnecessary, and being unwiliing to epose an udividuaL tisthis: thefactof tbe uiperlontledeGst ofthieNorwich pohee 'whose antecedents in connexion with ether cntbulary police force have been so disreputable as to cause his expulsion from more than one of them, being suffered to assume and retain a title which the law gives to my offiee as the head of a county crunstabusary, is a great incoc,esie.ce anddetriment to the publicerervico. Although thers isno law positively forbidding a i,an to call himself a bishop, or anything else to which he has no sight, I felt that it was incumbent upon me to obiect to the assumption of the superintendeDt of p,llce. I did so at the tuie, and I cannot but think the watch committee had had a desire to cultivate a good feeling between the police of the county and t6,e city my rePresentation, would have had a very different result. 'Under all c rcurnstances, I have no hesitation in saying that to permit the superintendent of the Norwich police to hold the title of chief constable is an insut to every conuty poUce force in 1 ogland."
This was the libel declared upon by the plaintiff and jils. tified by the defendant, and for which the former now sought to recover damages from the latter.
Ir. Serjeant BYLEs having briefly opened the faots, and formsal proof having been given of the publication by the defendant of the correspondence of wbich the above forms part in one or two locai apers
hir. Enghsh was called and e4id,-I ram the plaintiff in this case, and am from county of Clare, in Ireland. I was educated at Ennis coilege. My family had misfortunes. At the age of 19 I got an appointment in the London Metropolitan Police force. I resigned at my mother's request and went back to Ennis. In June, 1840, I obtained an appointnient in the Lancashire police force. There was in that body a superintendent named Fenix. While in Lancashire I applied for an inspectorship in the county of llerts. I was then at Mddleton. I had an offer of the place of firstclass constable at a guinea a-week. I went to Herts. I was not discharged. I had a greater chance of promnotion. In 1841 two men were sent to Hertford gaol, couimitted for laying snares for game. They were taken from Ware. Farrell, another policeman, came with us out of Ware to prevent disturbance. We arrived at the gaol about 6 p.m. As we went aloung the brother of the prisoners offered them some bread and cheese and beer. I objected, but FarreU advised use to allow them, and I did, because they would be too late for the last meal at the gaol. I did not know that they had been drinking before they had been brought from Hoddesden. I was discharged for this by Captain Robertson. I never heard of any charge of miisconduct to Mrs. Ferraby. I have found her, and given her address to the defendant. I was then introduced by Lord Shaftesbury to Mr. Branston, M.lP. for Essex, and I was made superior officer in the Essexc force, and remained from April, 1842, to November, 1843. 1 then resigned, and the chief constable, Captain Ml'Hardy, gave me a certifiete I then went to Suffolk, &ud was appointedto aprivate police force formed for the suppression of incendiarism. i was much occupied with the tres. I went to Bury St. Edmund's as superintendent of the police of a society for the detection of incendiarism in the western division. By the influence of Major Rushbrook I was appointed managing clerk at Mr. Bainbri's, a Parliamentary ageni in Westminster. I then went to Newport as superintendent of police. There 'were disturbances there. I was sanatery agent during the cholera time. I resigned and went to Pontefract. 1 was the superintending constable to a large district. I was then appointed chief constable at Norwichi. (In the course of this witness's examination a great number of testimonials in his favour were put in.)
Cross-examined by Sir F. TIssiGER.-Afy father was not a sexton ar Ennis. 1838 is the date of nsy entry into the police fore I did get a certificate when I left the metro-
Politan force. I was tau Lane-as-hir'e 10 "o-r 11 m-o-nt Iis. r1 g'o-t a certificate. I got it in 1856. I never applied befor,. I was dismissed from the Herts police force for lhaving taken two men drunk to gaoL There was no other charge. I now know MIrs. Ferraby, landlady of the Chequers. I did not then. I never, when Mr. Feriaby was absent, proposed to show Mrs. Ferraby some Freuch prints. I did not partiaUy unroU them, or offer to show them to her. I did not ask her for a quartern of tum. I did not, when she was on a chair reaching the spirits, take liberties with her or use indecent lan-
gusge. never used my hands improperly-notbing of that
ind occurred before or after my dismissal. I have gone into six or seven counties to find MIrs. Ferraby. I found her on Sunday last, at Great Grinsby, in Lincolnshire. I asked her whether she remembered an occnrrence taking place when sbe kept the Chequers wbich led to the disn.i-sal of a police officer. After some hesitation she said she did. I did not say, "Do You know his name ?" She did not say that she did not at that moment, but her husband would. He was iu upstairs. He knocked with his stick. MIrs. Ferraby went upstairs. I was going to follow her, but sbe asked me to stay at the foot of the stairs. After a 8hort timue she desired me to walk up. I asked him if he could remnember th, ircumstance, and what sort of man it was.
MIr. Ferrabji !d no as , "The man's nauie was English."; I oid not say, '- Was not the man's name Rafferty." They
did not either of them say they were sure liafferty was not | the namne. I did not say, "ThenL there iust, be two Erpleibes, for I was not there." [hir F. Thesiger here said to the witness very impressively.-" I now tell you, Sir,
Mis. Ferrabv is in court.] Mrs. Ferraby asked me if I bad been at Wheatharnpstead. I did not say I bad never betn there on duty, but I said I had never been at her b(use. I tokii her I bad brought an sctii'cs against Captain Blackjfor a ibl, and that one of the accusations against n.e wvathat I had taken liberties with her. I did not say 1 hed icen Captain Rubertsou's book, and tissi that
.I arge was made in it. I said I had seen Captain% bot ert-on, and le led me to suppose that the ibasge was taking liberties with her. Mrs. Ferraby said 'here was no charge made ; she did iot sav charge of rape, I ut of taking liberties. I did not Poy that if she said any. thing against me I would produce Bargess and others vho would ray something about her former character. I did, mention Burgess I said he had represented Mrs. Ferraby as being a rather locse character. She said Bnrgess laid a spite against her, hut that he knew nothinjg about ier. She did not eay, "Isaw them only once or twice before they took the house, and this clearly_proves to mue that you must be the man." I did not say, "I see yon are badly situated, your husband being ill, and I think we can do without you - 3 ou can do me no good." I shook hands with both. She did not say sbe felt very indignant about the matter. This was last Sunday. I had seen Captain Robertson some days before. I told MIrs. Ferraby that there was another charge against me for taking two men drunk to gaol, and being drunk myself, but I was a teetotaller at the tinme. After my dismissal I had some correspondence with Captain Robertson, the chief constable of lerts. lie offered to reinstate me in the force. Captain M'Bardy, chief constable of Essex, at first offered me a first-class constable's place. In consequence of my services at a riot at some races at Chelmford he gave me an inspectorship. Two months after I wisbed to better myself by going into the Ipswich force. I told Captain I'Hardy 1 had been in the Herts force, and that Captain Robertson had offered to reinstate me. At the end of 1843 1 resigned my place under Captain M'Elardy, and got another office at Polstead. Captain M'Hardy offered to advance me if I was active in detection of incendiaries. I had written a letter which I knew would militate against ny promotion. Captain MI'Hardy did not soy that if I wonld not resign he would dismiss me. I destroyed the letter. I got it from Mr. MIartin, a tai'or, to whom it was written. I do not know about giving him 101. for it, but I got it and destroyed it. FA paper washere handed to witness by Sir F. Thesiger]. This is a copy of the letter. Captain M'lHardy never spoke to me about this letter. Ilis secretary did, and expressed his regret that I had written such a letter, and added that it would be a caution to me through life. I said I was sorry. Nothing was ever said about its being impossible for me to remain in the force after such a letter. My dismissal or resignation was never put on the ground of this letter. I had resigned before. I was spoken to about it either by the secretary or the captain. Some time ago a complaint was made of a house being kept open late by a Mrs. Brown, a publican. Iwas charged with having said to her, "You should not keep your house open after hours; but let me give you a piece of advice,-lock your door, and when anyo.e knocks say, 'Wait, and I'll get the key;' then get some one to clear the glasses away, open your Bible, and look religious." I was admonished for this.
Re-examined by Mr. Serjeant BYLES.-The charge was wholly unfounded. It was made by Sergeant Smith. [Ilere one of tho jury asked if there was any niinute of his admonishment, bht the town-clerk of Norwich, having referred to his official book, said that none such appeared, and that his idea was that Mr. English had been cautioned to be more careful in future, on account of the ill-will of Smith.] I obtained my appointment at Polstead before I was dismissed from Essex. I sent both the certificates given me by Captain M'Hardy to the Norwich people. The letter was never mentioned to me until after I
ad resigned. M'Hardy knew I was engaged at Polstead, only two miles away. There is no foundation whatever for the charges made about Mrs. Ferraby. She said that the policeman was between 23 and 30 years old, and had black whiskers. I said I was only 22, and had no whiskers. [The ,witness here repeated the material portion of his answers in chief.]
Mr. Mexdham, town-clerk of Norwich, Nathaniel Coppock, clerk to the justices at Ware, and Farrell, the policeman who helped the plaintiff to take the poachers out of Iare, were called, and to some extent explained and corroborated portions of the plaintiff's evidence.
Sir F. TEEsIGcXI then addressed the jury for the defence, and in a very lucid manner remarked upon all the weak points in the case for the plaintiff, and said that he should be able to contradict almost every important statement made by him, and should show beyond all doubt that his antecedents in connexion with other county constab-alary forces had been so disreputable as to cause his expulsion from more than one of them. The learned counsel then commented upon the letter written in 1843 by the plaintiff to his tailor, and, subject to an objection as to its admissibility, read it to the jury. It ran as follows, and created a most extraordinary sensation in court :

"STE 'HE& ENGLISH,"
M1r. U.NTHAxIc, for the defendant, called Barnes, a superintendent of police in Herts, who proved that he remembered the fact that two poachers were sent from Ware to Hertford under the care of the plaintiff, that they were sober when they were committed at Ware, and said to be drunk when they arrived at Hertford.
The Governor of Hertford Gaol stated that if prisoners came in after 6 p.m. they had to wait until the next morning before they had anything to eat, aud then they had that sgiy h but if they complained of hunger they were fed
Mrs. Ferraby was then called and said, --I now live at Great Grimsbi , in Lincolnshire. I formerly kept the Chequers, at 3romer, in Herts. There was a policeman named English. He came to my house one day; my husband was out. He asked me to draw him a quartern of rum. I went into the bar for the purpose, and he followed me. As I was stepping up to reach the spirits he put his hand in an " imprudent " way on my waist and used indecent words. I cannot remember the words. I recollect him bringing some prints, which I had forgotten until he brought it to my mind on Sunday last. He said they were French. I cannot say what they were, but I saw enough to tell me that I did not wislh to see them, He partly unroled them. Re made use of words not at all pleasing. I repeated thom to my husband. -le asked for something from the top of the cupboard-shot or caps. He did these " imprudent" things and used the words more than once. Some one came. He drank his rum and went. I told my husband, and he complained to Hilliard, the inspector, who came with Captain Robertson to inquire. On Sunday last I saw the plaintiff at Great Grimsby. My husband was ill. He knocked at the door, and asked if MIr. Ferraby was in. I went to him, and he said, "I presume you are Mrs. Ferraby." le asked me if I recollected an occurrence which took place when I kept the Chequers, at Cromer, which caused the dismissal of a policeman. I said I did. e said, "Do you or would you know the man ? " I said, " No, not at such a length of time." He said, "Do you know the name?" I said, " I do not, but my husband would." I went upstairs, where my husband was ill. English cante afterwards. He asked my husband if the man's namne was Rafferty. My husband said, "No." He then asked, "Was it English 9" My husband said, "That was the name;" 1, too, said, "That was the name." The plaintiff then said, "But don't you remember the man at all; can't you describe the cuolor of his hair?" I said, "No." He said, "What kind of whiskers had he?" I said, "Indeed, Sir, I do not know." He said, " The name is all right in Captain Robertson's book; bitt there must have been two Englishes. He said he never was stationed at Wheathampstead. [Witness here detailed some further conversation, not very material to the issue.] A person named Burgess succeeded me at the Chequers. English said, "If you come and say anything about me I'll call Burgess and others to speak to your former character." I said, "' Well, Burgess can know little about me, for I only saw him once or twice in my life; that tells nie you must be the man." He said, "I am not the man." He said he had come to take me to London as a witness for him, but he saw I was badly off, my husband being so ill, and he thought lie could do wit out me, and I should do him no good. He asked my husband whether he could see any features in him which he could recogniZe, and when he stood Uimyhusband said, " You are not unlike the man, let me teh wou." He shook hands with us, and I said, "I feel very indignant about the matter."
This witness was subjected to a severe cross-examination by Mr. Serjeant BYLES, but nothing very rmaterial was elicited.
Captain Robertson, chief constable of the Herts constabulary force, was examined, and swore that English, having been suspended, was finally dismissed, on the charge of having taken improper liberties with Mrs. Ferraby, but that afterwards he had written to him to say that he would give him one more chance of regaining his character.
Captain M'Elardy, chief constable of Essex, said that the plaintiff was allowed to resign, as a umore lenient course than that of dismissal, in consequence of his having written the letter before alluded to to MIr. Martin, and added, " I should have boon unworthy the office I hold if I had allowed
him to remain in the force after writing such a letter."
In answer to a question put to hilm bY Serjeant BYLES I he said that the Rev. Mfr. Sims never repreved him (Captain M'liardy) for using bad language, nor did he say, "1I do nIot care a Royal damnu." Both these witnesses agreed in saying that the plaintiff was an excellent police officer. Captain M'Hardy's evidence was confirmed by his secretary, Mr. ]Burke, who was resent when the fatal letter was shown to the plaintiff, and5when he was virtually dismnssed.
The case on both sides being concludeda,
Sir FlurDmcic TilESIGEB preceeded to rum up the evidence, which he did at somie length.
Mir. Serjeant BItLES then replied; and
Mr. Justice WILLIAms having gone carefully through all the facts, upon each of which he commtented to the jury, they returned a verdict for the plaintiff-Damages, 501.

Court Of Exchequer, Jan. 29.
COURT OF EXCHEQUER, J,. 29.
DA2flEL V. THE OFFICIAL MAXAGER OF THE ROYAL
BRITMH BANK.
(SiUina i7b BanMM.
ir. AUFLLISH showed camse against a rulo obtained by the plaintiff calling upon Mr. Andrew Beattie, a shareholder of the Royal Britis Bank, to show cause why a scire facis should not issue against him for the recovery of the amount of a debt for which judgment had been obtained against the bank, on the ground that Mr. Beattie was a shareholder at the time such judgment was recovered. It appeared that Mr. Beattie was one of that unfortunate class who having deposited money with the bank had been in. duced to become shareholders, instead of depositors, on the faith of the dourishing reports and dividends issued by the directors. The shares thus issued had been appropriated to the extension of the capital under the terms of anew charter, and it appeared that wben the ban,k stopped paymlent, af ter having paid a few more dividends to Mr. Beattie and otherainilasly situated, that gentleman reppsdiated his shares, and
> .ught to prove for the amount of his deposit as a creditor of the batk, on the ground that hp had been induced to take his sbares by the fraudulent representation of the directors, and on that ground he now resisted this rule, -which was but an echo of sinjilar proceedings in boththe other courts, and in which judgment had not yet been delivered.
Mr. Lush appeared foi the plaintiff, but was not called on to support his rule.
The C1iEF BARON stated that the Court would take time to consider its judgment in conference with the learned judges of the other court. In the event of it being necessary to call upon the plaintiff due notice would be given.
Judgment deferred accordingly.
CATTERSSOLE V. HODGSON.
Mr. H. T. COLE moved for a rule, calli: g on certain attorneys of this court, whose names were not mentioned, to pay over to the plaintiff the sum of 1501., and to answer the matters disclosed in the affidavit on which he moved. From the statenient of the learned counsel it appeared that the plaintiff, who is a publican at Kingston, in Surrey, was one day called on by one Sager. who represented himself to be a clerk of the attorneys in question, and Eolicited by him for authority to bring an action in their name to recover a debt of 2301. due to the plaintiff from one Hodgson. After some hesitation and delay by the plaintiff Sager offered to hold the plaintifffree from all costs whatever in the said action for the sum of 1001. to be paid out of the verdict, and to these terms the plaintiff assented whereupon Sager wrote a letter to the effect that, in consideration of the payment of 1001. to him (Sager) out of any sum which might be recovered from Mr. Eodgson, he agreed to hold the plaintiff harmless from all costs, and from the costs of the defendant in the event of the cause being lost. After this the action was brought by the attorneys, in whose employment Sager then was andAtil is, and a verdict was recovered by the plaintiff. Eventually, on a rule for a new trial, the matter was referred to the late Mr. Baron Alderson, who had tried the cause, and he awarded the sum of 1501. to the plaintiff, which sum the attorneys received, who now refused to recognize Sager's agreement, though they had adopted it and recognised it by carrying on the action.
The CouBT thought there was good ground shown for calling on these gentlemen to hand over to the plaintiff the sum ot 501. under the agreement, but they declined to call upon them to answer the mattersof the affidavit.
The rule so granted was made returnable on Saturday next.
Rule niei accordingly.
SOSSE v. iONTEFIORE.
Mr. LuSH moved on behalf of the defendant for his discharge from prison under the foUowing circumstances :-It appeared that the defendant, whose name has been of late mueh before the public elsewbere, had been arrested by a creditor in another cause on the ground that he was about to quit England, whereupon other creditors, including the plantiff in this case, had lodged detainers against him on the same ground. Mr. M onteliore, however, had obtained his discharge from custody in al the other eases on his absolute affidavit denying al intention whatever of removing from the jurisdiction of the s nprior courts. The present rule was f ounded on such an affidavit.
The COURT granted the rule, and made it returnable on Saturday.
(Sittirsgs at 2isi Prium before Jlr. Baron BRASWRLL
and Common Juries.)
LEE V. EVEEST.
Mfr. Serjeant Einglake and Mr. Jones appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Bovill and Mr. Thrup for the defendant.
This was an action brought to recover a sum of 491. for wvork and labour. The defendant pleaded never indabted.
It appeared that the plaintiff was an architect and surveyor living in Golden-scuare, and the defendant was the soliitor to the parish officers of Epsom. According to the plaintiff's case a new valuation of that parish was made in 1852, and a poor-rate made on the scale of that valuation. Among several persons who appealed against the rate on the uround that the valuation was not properly made were the Gas Companv; Mr. Dorling, the owner of the Grand Stand; and a Mr. White, whose house adjoined the County Court. A Mr. Penfold, the surveyor who had made the disputed valuation, was instructed by the defendant, who had heard that appeals were likely to be made against the rate, to find a gentleman of great experience who would confim his valuation. He accordingly communicated with the plaintiff. a very eminent architect and surveyor, who thereupon valued the gasworks, the Grand Stand, and three houses. When the appeals were heard the plaintiff had attended on the part of the parish to give evidence in support of the rate. ae had been employed altogether 52 hours on the business, and he had charged a sam of 491., which was contended to be a reasonable remureration for his trouble. He sent in his biU in 185o3 to the defendant, but no notice being taken of it he wrote 10 or 12 letters, but he received no reply. He had consequently brought the present action to recover the amount due to him for his services.
Several witnesses wero caled to prove these facts. At the conclusion of the plaintifi's case,
Mr. BOVILL submitted that the defendant had simply acted as the agent of the parish officers, andi, therefore, no action could be maintained against him by the plaintiff, whose proper remedy was against the defendants prin cipals.
Mr. Serjeant KL\GLn,n admitted that if the defendant, had simply suppeenaed the plaintiff as a witness to attend at the hearing of the appeals against the rate, his principals would have been liable, and the plaintiff would have had no claim against him; but he (Mr. Serjeant Kinglake) contended that the defendant had m ade himself personally liable by speciaUy instructing Mr. Penfold to get some person, not as a witness in any existing cause, but to qualify himself to support his valuation in case of any appeal being made against t he rate.
hIr. Baron BRAM MWELL, after having left the Court for the purpose of consulting his brother judges, on his return said that the case must go to the jury.
The defence was that the plaintiff had admitted, by commencing an action in the first place against the pari-h offiicers, that they were the persons liable, and they had not disputed their liability, but had objected to pay the excessive charges made by the plaintiff They had tendered him 201L, wvhich he had refused.
Witnesses were called in support of this view of the case. The learned counsel, having addressed the jury for the respective clients,
Mr. Baron BRAs E:Ta said, he could not.comprehend why the plaintiff, instead of running his head into the present difficulty, had not proceeded with his action against the parish officers, whose tender of 201. would have been fatal to them. There would be two questions for the consideration of the Jury: first, were the plaintiff's charges for his services fair and reasonable? and secondly did the defendant employ the plaintiff upon the terms thatbhe was to be the paymast( r of te latter ? As a rule, an attorney was merely the agent c f another person, and if he simply subpoenaed a man he wFS not liable, the witness's action for expenses being against the principal, For instance, in case of the death of the attorney, could it be said that the witness would be able to proceed against the executors ? The idea was absurd. Ho w- ever, if an attorney employed a stationer to draw up a brief he wouldbe liable personally, because the debt was incurred for doing that which the attorney would otherwise have had to do himself, and for which he was entitled to charge his client. It had been contended on the part of the plaintiff that the fact of his having been sent down to Epsom for the purpose of qualifying himself for a 'sis"ess, there being at that time no cause in existenoe, had A de the defendant personaUy liable; but he (MIr. Baron Bramwell) did not see the distinction between a man being told to qualify himself as a witness, and beiDg simply subpoenaed. Surely the attorney was not more liable in one case than in the other. The Jury must look at the evidence and see if there was anything tbat would make the present case differ from the general rule. One thing that appeared to him almost conclusive against the plaintiff was that, if lie had not attended in pursuance of his instructions at the hearing of the appeals, and the tate had been prejudiced in consequence of such nonattendance, the parish officers and not the defendant would have had a right of action against him. The jury must say whether the plaintiff was entitled to recover anything at all against the defendant, and, if they found that question in bin favour, what amount did they consider was a fair remuneration for his services.
The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for 491., the amount claimed.
Mr. Baron BnR,%rsvELI.-Then, Mr. Bovill, you must have leave to move.

_ THTE ACTEV.-COLLISION.
(Before Dr. LUSHINGTON.)
mis was a suit brought by the brig Alert, of the burden of 88 tons, against the bark Activ, of the burden of 364 tons, to recover for a total loss occasioned by a collision between them at 11 30 p.m. on the 2d of October last, a few miles from Whitby. T,he brig, coal*laden, was bound from Middlesborough to Cliff Creek, and at the time in question, according to her account, descried the light of the Activ distant a mile or a mile and a-half, on which she immediately showed a bright light over the starboard quarter. The bark, however, continued to approach her without altering ber course, and struck her so violent a blow that she sunk in a few minutes. She attributed the fault of the collision to the want of a good lookout on board the bark. The bark, in ballast, was proceeding from Hull to Shields, and the atmosphere, as she represented, was so dark and thick that a vessel without a light could not be seen more than 200 to S00 yards off. On descrying the brig, distant 200 yards, she imimediatelv ported her helm, and hailed the brig to do the same, instead of which she appeared to starboard it, and then ran into the bark.
Dr. JENNER and Dr. DEANE were heard for the brig; Dr. ADDAMS and Dr. Twiss for the bark.
The ELDER BRETHRE , by whom the Court was assisted, were of opinion that the blame rested wholly on the bark.
Decree accordingly.
THlE RIVAL- COLLISION.
This was an action brought by the brig Express against the bark Rival, to obtain compensation for the loss resulting from a collision which occurred between them at 4 30 a.m. on the 23d of August last. The brig, in the prosecution of he'r voyage from Terra Vecehia, inL Spain, to Rigs, laden with salt, brought up in Yarmouth Roads about noon on the 22d. The samne evening, between 6 and 7 o'clock, the bark also came to anchor, and, as alleged, gave the brig a fou beth whch edto hedamge omlaiedof. The

POLICE.
GUmDRALL.-Wlliam Bryant and Thomas Welch were charged before Alderman CARTER with picking a lady's pocket in St. Poul's-churchyard.
Michael Haydon, 21, city force, said he saw the two prisoners in St. Paul's-churchvard on Wednesday afternoon and observed Welch placel hinself in front of a lady, while Bryant ut his hand into her pocket and drew out some-
iDg, w 'ch he gave to Welch, and they ran away immnediately. Witness followed them to the corner of Old Change, where he sawthem examining something. which one of them put in his pocket. Witness secured them, and found on Welch a purse containing 12s. in silver.
The prisoners were reManded until Saturday, in the expectation that the owner will in the interim come forward and claim the purse, which is at the Fleet-street policestation.
EBOW-ST EET.-Mrr. JARDE has received a check for 21. i .. from "J. G." An acknowledgment was requested in The Times.
MARsLsoR0TJGHsTRm,v.-4ohn Charles Warne was charged with stealing a quantity of gold, the property of his employer, Mr. William Chapman' jeweller, F'rith street.
It appeared that a burglary was committed in May last at the prosecutor's shop, but no suspicion attached to the prisoner, who had then recently entered into prosecutor's employ. Circumstances having come to the knowledge of the prosecutor which led him to suspect the prisoner's honesty, a watch was kept on his movements, and on Wednesday PoHce-constable Mitchell, A 298, followed the prisoner to a refiner's shop in Jerusalem-passage, Clerkenwell, and took him into custody as he was in the act of disposing of some gold. The prisoner at once admitted that the gold belonged to his employer, and the keeper of the shop stated that the prisoner had frequently brought gold there for sale.
The gold having been identified by Mr. Chapman, the prisoner was sent to prison for six months.
Silas Dollin was charged with stabbing Thomas Comber, bricklayer, No. 8, Cleveland-street.
The complaiant said he was standing at the bar of the George and Dragon publichouse, Cleveland-street, about 9 oclock on Wednesday evening, when the prisoner came in, and looling him in the face, without saying a word pulled a chisel from his sleeve, and stabbed him in the chest. The prisoner made snother stab, which complainant warded partly with his hand, which was wounded, as also was his body. Complainant bled very much, aLnd was taken to the hospitL Complainant had not had any previous quarrel with the prsoner, Who appeared quite sober.
From the medical examination the doctor was induced to state that had the blow taken effect an inch lower down it must have killed complaLinant on the spot.
The prisoner saad the stabs were given unintentionaly. Remanded till Thursday next.
Evans, Williams, and White, three young men in a state of complete destitution, wvere charged with stealing bread from a baker's sho
Henry Gerett, taker, Porter.street, said Wiliams came into the shop, deliberately took a quartern loaf, walked out with it, and, dividing it with the others, began to eat it.
The prisoners all pleaded they were out of work, could not get employment, and were destitute and hungry.
Mr. BNaGs said if persons like the prisoners made it a practice to go into bakers' shops and help themselves there would soon be no one to carry on the trade of a baker. He was sorry to hear that the prisoners were unable to get work, but, whatever their amount of destitution, they had no excuse for what they had done, as relief was always to be had from the parishes in which they slept last. Al they had to do was to go to the relieving officer, who would in stantly give them relief, or, if he should refuse, to go to a magistrate, who would immediately compel the relieving officer to do his duty.
Williams.-I went yesterday to the West London Union, and they would give me nothing.
Mr. BmGHA3r.-Then, why did you not go at once and complain to the Lord Mayor?
Williams.-I did go to the Mansion-house, but on telling my business to the officer he said the Lord Mayor could do nothing, and he would not let sue in.
MIr. BnisGnA.-Why did you not insist on your rights, and say you would see the Lord Mayor?
_ Willits-It was of no use. The officer said I should not see the Lord Mayor.
-Mr. BixGaANa sent the prisoners for seven days to prison' 21 10s. from " J. G.," and 61. 12s. 6d. from the steward of St. Jame's' cricket ball, have been received for the poorbox.
MAnTYLEBoNE.-George Skinner, Wiliam Britton, and Alfred Wheeler were brought up for the third time before Mr. Lo1G, charged with a burglary on the night of the 6th nit, or at an early houron the following morning, at thehouse of Mr. Marshfleld, landlord of the Sailor's Return, Cochrane-terrace, St. John's-wood, and steaLing from the said premises a gold watch and guard, a gold brooch, some wearing apparel, and other artiCles of the value of upwards
The particulars of what transpired upon the former investigations have already appeared; some additional evidence was now brought forward, and the prisoners were sent for trial at the Central Criminal Court.
" J. G." has forwarded 21. lOs. for the poorbox, with a request that an acknowledgment might appear in The 2Times.
WEsTrNsTELr-A young man having the appearance of a sailor, who gave the name of Thomas Ayling, was charged with concealing himself in a tavern with intent to eommit a felony,
Mr. B. Ward, the proprietor of the Two Brewers, Tufton. street, Westminster, said that at U o'clock on the pre-ious night he waS informed by his waiter that the prisoner had concealed himself under a bench in the taproom, and having satisfied himself that such was the case he communicated his suspicions to two friends in the parlonr, when it was arranged that they should remain concealed in the bar, and that witness should go up stairs as though he had retired for the night. On the honse being closed this plan was carried into effect, but on prosecutor coming down a little while afterwards without his shoes in the dark, one of his friends, thinking it was the prisoner, gave him a blow on the side of the head which had rendered him very deaf. He and his friends then went into the taproom, and found the prisoner concealed there.
The waiter proved that prisoner, in the coarse of a conversation last Sunday night, inquired particularly of him where his master slept.
Andrew O'Shea, 156 B, said that on searching the prisoner he found a very large flatly pointed nail, some keys, and lucifer matches.
Prisoner said that " want of grub" made him go there.
Mr. ARsxoLD having inquired whether prisoner wished to n'risoner replied, " I intended to do it," He was remanded for a week.
2L 10s. has been receivod from " J. G.," and an acknowledgment requested in The Times.
WonissP.sTRlyr.-The magistrates intimated their receipt of the foUowing contributions, the donors of which requested an acknowledgment in this paper:-For the poorbox-" E. P.," acheck for5fL; "A Sinner,ninstamps, 10s.;

CLERXEN-WELL.-A poor woman attended at the court and stated that she had applied at this court yesterday afternoon for advice and assistance, as she was in the greatest distress. On Tuesday she had been compeUed to walk the streets in the wet and cold the whole of the night, and all that she had had in her lips yesterday was a single glass of cold water. The magistrate then told her to go ro St. Pancras Workhouse, which she at once did, and, after waiting at the gates for some time, was admitted along with some more of the casual poor. She went to bed, having had nothing whatever to eat, and this morning, having given her a penny loaf and compeUed her to pick a certain amount of oakuma, she was again turned loose upon the world, without anything to eat, or the prospect of being able to earn any money to procure it when nature required.
Mr. TYRWniTT asked her if she belonged to St. Pancras Parish.
Applicant replied in the aairmative, and said that she had not received aything from the parish for the past four years. She had told Mr. Clark, one of the officials, that she belonRed to the parish, and that she wanted relief, when that gentleman said that the parish had done all they could for her and would do no more.
Mr. TyRWAIwTT said that the parish authorities were bound to give her more than that, and directed that a policeofficer should go with her to the workhouse and make inquiries.
Dr. John Sutton, MLR.C.S., alias Dr. Sidney iall, alias Dr. Manning, a short, well-dressed young man of gentle. manly manners, apparently about 24 years of age, described
s a surgeon, residing at No. 15, Frederick-place, Goswellroad, (lerkenwell, who was charged last Friday on a warrant with unlawfully attempting to extort money by publishing a libel against M1r. William Harman, a farmer residing at Sleaford, in Lincolnshire, was again examined.
Mr. aines attended for the prosecution, Mr. Robinson, barristr, defended the prisoner, and Mr. Wakeling attended for another person interested to watch the case.
The partculars of the former examination have already appearedinThTimes. The complainant, it appeared,some time since saw in the newspapers the prisoner's advertisements, and having entered into a correspondence with him communicated to the prisoner, in his medical cap acity, certain facts of a strictly private nature. For some time the pnsoner sent and was paid for his advice and medicine.
butE 3r. Harinan, who -it- oWuld- --e -vasr,otTblessdl with too much wit, he having consulted a planet
reader and strologer in connexion with the PIsOner and the case, finding that he received no benefit from Dr. Sutton, left off communicating with him. The prisoner then wrote to say that if the prosecutor did not at once send him 251. he should publishthe whole of the private letters that had passed between them. Although so young the defendant has published a pamphlet of 16 pages, entitled
Quackery Unmasked, being a complete exposition of the frauds, impositions, and deceptions practised by those wbo advertise a speedy, safe, and effectual cure of a particular disease." After stating that he has devoted many years to the consideration of the subject, he has the following remarks on the frauds and impositions of quacks, which are so connected with the charge against him that they are worthy of reproduction here:-" Many who read thesepages 'irespond to the truth of this ; will remember doubtless, the tempting offer, the flattering promise, the guaranitee of a cure, which caused them to send pound after pound, in the vain hope of obtaining ultimate relief. The frauds nd impositions practised by those unprincipled and ignorant men know no bounds, and are of the most extrz-vagant . Extortion' is a word which but mildly exprwses their ordary boundary. 'Robbery' would be a more fitting term. And how do they escape punishment? By having the audacity to threaten exposurc." (The italic is Dr. Sutton's.) "It is then that the victim awakes to the true character of him whom he had imagined to be a faithful medical adviser, and finds him only an ignorant impostor, in whom every particle of honour, principle, and upnrihtness is entirely lost. Unfortunately for the sufferer he has no remedy. Fear of the disgrace with which lie is threatened, indutes him to stoop and gratify the robber's demands; and
thins he finds health is lost, his purse lessened, and the vil. lain escapes unpunished and serves many others in the same manner." It was under these circumstances that a warrant was granted for the person's apprehensioru
Mr. Haines said that since the Isst occasion the prisoner had written to his client anote stating tbathe wasextre,uely sorry for the course he had pursued, that he was sincerely sorry for what he had done, and expressed a hope that if he made a full and ample apology in open court he would not proceed further with the charge. Under thete circumstances he, on the part of Mr. Harnan, was prepared to accept that apology, and to withdraw from further proceeding Ith the prosecution.
Mrv. Robinson said he was there on the part of the defendant, and was quite wlliing to make the most fuU and ample apology that conld he required, and to state that the defendant was extremely sorry for the course he had pursued. Ile might, however, state that, according to his instructions, the defendant never had the slightest wish nor intention of publishing Mr. Harmar's private communication, and he wrote the note complained of under great excitement, caused by acommunication received from the complainant. There had been acivilaction in the Clerkenwell CountyCourt, and ie thought the matter would have ended.
Mr. Haines might be allowed to remark that Mr. Harman in that case was awarded his costs of travelling from the country.
Mr. TYRWHv= said it was a very serious thing for persons to have the confidential notes which they sent to their medical men made public. As all parties appeared satisfied, the prisoner would be discharged; but he had better be carefal how he got iR such trouble again.
The prisoner, who seemed to have suffered from his incarceration, was then discharged.
Long before the hour appointed for the re-examination of the prisoner the court and its avenues were crowded by respectably-dressed persons who had been swindled by quackdoctors, and they seemed very much disappointeds at the prisoner's dismissal.
The sitting magistrate requested ourr reporter to ackmovwledge the receipt of 2!. from *' J. ML," and a check for 51. 5s. from J. G.," for the poorbox of this court. Donations of this description at this inclement season of the year, and now that there is so much distress in this extensive district,
TRXAL-Two well-dressed men, who were said to be membersof the "swell-niob," andwho gave thenamesof John Simpson and Frederick M'Ewen, were charged before Mr. RsmoTr with being drank and disorderly in the Westminster-road on that morning and attempting to take away a street cab.
From the evidence adduced it appeared that on that morning at 4 o'clock the prisoners and two others, their companions, came out of Hart's night-house, in the Westminster-road, and insisted on being taken by a cabman. The driver, not being on the rank, refused compliance with their command, upon which Simpson jumped on the box and was about to ave awyamidaconiderablc disturbance, when theo interferedand took tphde prisones, who were the mosttuulnofalitocsdy
Police-constable M'Langhlin, 174 L, sid he knew both of the prisoners very well, and particularly the person who gave the name John Simspson. His realname was Henry Goody, a Well-known member of theswell-mob, who had been transported a few years ago for n omnibus robbery, and his (M'Laughlin's) belief was that at the prescnt time he was a ticket-of-leave man.
The prisoners said that the whole fault rested with the cabman, who refused to take them as they requested.
They were convicted in a penalty of lOs., which they ultimately paid.
Jamnes Hill, who described himself as a commission agent
was charged with attempting to enter the dwelling-house of Sergeant Thornhuil, 30 ?, by means of a skeleton key.
It appeared that on the evening before, at 6 o'clock, while at tea, Eergeant Thoruhi herard some person on the outside endeavouring to urlock his door, and on opening the door himself the sergeant foutd the prisoneronn the steps oe instantlyvstarted off} and threwr away a skeleton key in his fiHght; hut he was taken into oustody, and brought back to te house.
MIr. Jones, who happened to be passing at the time, said he saw three men run out of the front garden of the prosecutor's house, two of them ranning in one direction and the prisoner in another. Seeing Sergeant Thornhill follow the prisoner, he witness) followed also, and while ruanring he neard a key drop from the prisoner.
The prisoner, in defence, said he was merely passing at he time hiself, when he was taken into custody.
Hiewas remanded to give time to look after his companions, as wel as for inquiries about himself.
Mr. EnLLIorr requested the acknowledgment of a check for 2?. lOa., from " J. G.,' for the poorbo,.

DUBLIN, TnuRSDAY MORLNInG. THE 1aINH, COtRT.
Iord Carlisle's first levee for the season, beld yesterday, was very fully attended, the severity of the weather, the streets being covered with snow, in nowise checking the flow of visitors, which comnmnenced at half-past 12 o'clock, and did not cease for nearly three hotirs. The clergy of the Established Church mustered in great force, but of the Roman 'Catholic not a single bishop or other dignitary attended to do honour to the representative of :Royalty. The gross number of visitors amounted to between 1,300 and 1,400.
PROGRESS OF LITIGATION.
The successful result of tbe case of "Bergin v. M'Dowell," tried before Mr. ,Justice MIoore on T'uesday, has completely reopened the floodgates of litigation in the affairs of the Tipperary Baiik. Yesterday there were no less than nine cases of scire facias against the official manager decided in the tConsolidated Court, and, as Mr. ArDowell was not represented by counsel, the jury had in each case nothing more to do than hand down a verdict for the plaintiff as quickly as counsel stated the nature and amount of the claim. The sums thus to be recovered vary in amount from 131. to 2501., and it may be observed that in every case the verdict carries the costs of action, which may be set down at the least at 251. A rather pleasant prospect for the shareholders, who must eventually pay them ! Altogether it seems to be " confusion worse confounded" in every step that has been taken towards the miscalled settlement of the unfortunate Tipperary Bank swindle. Some further effects of the result of this litigation wil be seen by a perusal of the following statement, which appears in the Clonmel Chroaielc of yesterday
" Friday last Mr. SamTLel Murray Gason, sub-sheriff for the county Tipperary, proceeded with his bailiffs and a constabulary party to the lands of Kilpatrick, distant about four miles from Tipperary, to execute a writ of iemri facias, at the suit of Mr. George M'Dowell, the official manager, against the goods of Mrs. Catherine Marnane, who held as executrix of her husband nine shares in this unfortunate concern, and who besides was a depositor to a considerable amount. The only stock on the lands at the time of the seizure was nine cows, which were immediately taken possession of, but the violence of the populace who had congregated on the spot to resist the execution, completely prevented the sheriff from keeping possession of the stock, and ao violent did the crowd become that the police were obliged to use their bayonets, but to no purpose. In the sa6ce the constabulary suffered to a great extent, and in their efforts to keep bask the mob three of their bayonets were smashed. The sheriff deserves every praise for having acted all through with the utmost determination and forbearance, but every effort of his to quell the riot and allay the excitement was unavailing. At one time Mr. GasoR was obliged to present his loaded pistol at a man named Condon (who was conducting himself most violently, and who just then had hold of a policeman by the neck), in order to compel him to loosen his grip. On the evening of Ghe same day five of the rescuing party were arrested, and brought before iMr. P. C. Howley, R.M., who committed them to gaol until next morning, when they were all fully identified by the sheriff and police and returned for trial at the ensuing assizes of ClonmeL The parties arrested are NVilliam Edmond and T. Marnane, the widow Marnane's three sons, Timothy Power and Daniel Condon, and bail has since been entered into for their appearance at the assizes. A notice has been served by Mr. Nicholas Sadleir, agent to Mr. Ho"h Baker, Lismnacue, from whom Mrs. Marnane held the lands of Kilpatrick, claiming rent due to last gale day. Mr. Edmund Power, sub-sheriff, has received several writs, for execution against the property of other shareholders in this county."

LEGAL ACCIDENT.
TO TaE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-The attention of the directors of this company having been called to some recent letters in The Time
headed " legal accident," and signed " John Brady," in one of the latter of which Mr. Brady gives the name of the accused person as "John Matson Temple," and the place ,of his arrest in February, 1S53, as the Rugby station of this company, I am instructed to forward to you the enclosed letter, addressed to me by the solicitor, with reference to the case.
The directors have no wish to lessen in any degree the sympathy which may properly be claimed for the unfortunate widow and children of the convicted man, but they feel called upon to point out the discrepancies between the facts of the case and the statements put forward by Mr. Brady, some of which cast serions reflections on the servants of this company.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

"Dear Sir,-In reply to your inquiry as to the case of John Matson Temnpe, 1 have to state that in pursuance of instructions from the company a clerk frot ny office attended at the Coventry Assizes iu March, 1853, to instruct counsel and conduct the proseotion.
"The case was tried by Lord Wensleydale, then Mr. Baron Parke, and the defence was conducted by counsel and a solicitor on behalf of the accused. The statements pub. lished by Mr. Brady to which you refer me are in several particulars at variance with the facts.
" Mr. Brady states that Mr. Temple 'left town, for Manchaster by the night mail;' that 'on arriving at - (meaning Rugby; station, he changed his mind, and determined not to proceed to Manchester that night ;' and that, 'he was searced, his ticket for Manchester was found upon him. This fact was considered conclusive evidence that his leaving the train at this intermediate station was done for feionlous purposes.'
" It is not the fact that Mr. Temple was travelling from London, or that a ticket for M.anchester was found upon him; for it appears that on searching him the only ticket found was one from a station on the Shropshire Union Railway to Stafford, and that he was travelling, not from London with a ticket for Manchester, but from Stafford to Itugby without any ticket,
Mvr. Brady further states that on his arrest Temple I implored permission to write to his wife, but so great a favour could not be granted.'
" It appears that no such request was nide by Temple to any of the railway officers, by whom he was at once handed over to the county police at Rugby upon his arrest, and that the imputation which Mr. Brady seeks to cast upon the 'railway authorities' is without foundation.
" The following is the statement of William Chamber. layne, then Inspector of the County Police at Rugby, who
ad Temple in charge:-That, withont any application from Temple, he (Chamberlayne) asked him w hether he wished t,o nite to any one; to whichi he replied that he did not, as he did not want his friends to know the position he was in. That two or three days afterwards, and subsequently to his committal, and as he was about to leave for Coventry gaol, he asked Chamberlayne to allow him to write to his friends, to which Chamberlayne replied that there was not time to do so then, as the train would be starting directly, but that he would be in plenty of time to write from Coventry by that evening's post. It appears that he did write to his friends from the gaol at Coventry, as is borne out by the fat that he was vsited byhis wife soon after his committal, which took place on the 7th of February. The trial was not until the
hof rch, and Mr. Brady states that the brother of the aceused 'took upon himself the entire mana.gement of the
"An able and experienced counsel, Mr. O'Brien, was retained for the defence, and the case was tried by a most eminent judge. No application appears to have been made to the Court to postpone the trial in the absence of neces. sary witnesses, which would doubtless have been grantc-d if any ground could have been show n; from that tine to the present, a period of nearly four years, no application of any sort has been made on Temple's behalf, either by his counsel or any of his friends, to the railway company, or, as I believe, to any other quarter, suggesting that there had ben any mnscarriage of justice on this occasion.
"I am, dear Sir, yours faithfully.

The Loss Of The Tyne.
i TIHE LOSS OF THE TYNE.
OFFICIAL INOUIRY.
SOUTHAMPTON, THURSDAY.
The Board of Trade inquiry into the circumstances connected with the stranding of the Royal Mail Company's steamship Tyne, off St. Alban's Head, on the morning of the 13th inst., was opened this morning at 11 o'clock at the Guildhall. The magistrates on the bench were-Captain Breton (chairman), Admiral Bowyer, Messrs. J. IL Stebbing, J. Lobb, J. Clark, and R. Pearce. Captain Walker attended from the Board of Trade, accompanied by Mir. O'Dowd, solicitor wnder the Merchant Shipping Act, and Mr. W. EE. Buckell, Collector of Customs at this port. 31r. Coxwell, solicitor of Southampton, watched the proceedings on the part of Captain Valler, the commander of the ship. There was a large attendance of gentlemen interested in nautical matters, among whom were Captain Vincent, superintendent of the Royal Mail Company at Southampton; Captain McDougall, Admiraltyssuperintendent at Soutbampton; Captains Burney, Haste, Strutt, Parker, Bevis, and Weller; George Mils, Esq., superintending engineer; and several other officers in the company's service.
Mr. O'Dowd stated that he appeared there, in pursuance of instructions received from the Board of Trade, to inquire into the circumstances which had led to the loss of the Tyne, and, as this was the first inquirv of this nature that had been held at this port under the sanction of a recent act of Parliament, he would call attention to the statute under which the inquiry was held. It was held uwder section 433 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, which he read to the Court. That section constituted the magistrates a court of inquiry, and it would be their duty to send a report to the Board of Trade, based upon the evidence, which would be taken, with extracts from that evidence if they thought proper. The Board of Tr,de considered that the aid of a nautical assessor would be desira. ble; and, as questions would undoubtedly arise affecting the nautical skill of Captain Valler, requiring the co-opera. tion and advice of a gentleman high in position in the nautical profession, the senior member of the Marine Department of the Board of Trade was present to assist them in the inquiry. In fairness to Captain Valler he would state that, although he was not there to make any charge against that gentleman, yet morally he was undoubtedly on his trial. He would state the circumstances very briefly, as the captai was there to mnake his own statement ; but it would be an injustice to the highly respectable company by which he was engaged if he did not at once state that they had manifested every anxiety to keep the writnesses together, which wvs not always an easy matter, and to assist the Government iu their inquiry. The Tyne was built at Newcastle in 1854, and her registered tonnage was 1,788 4-10, giving, including the tonnage of the engine-room, a total capacity of about 2,100 tons. There were three sources of information open to them-the officers in charge of the vessel, the iogbook, and the passengers. He should not trouble them with any extensive body of evidence, as that of the passengers was out of thequestion,alloftthembeing inrbed atthe timeof the disaster, and they could give no evidence of its immediate antecedents. [he logboat was in court, and the officers, including Captain Valler himself. It was true that the master was not a disinterested witness, but, from the communications he had had with him, he was satisfied that he would be a most trustworthy and honest witness, although his own character and position were at stake. Captain Valler had, under the old law, obtained a certificate from the Trinity Board, and on the consolidation of the maritime laws under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, he obtained a certificanc from the Board of Trade. He was an accurate and skilful navigator, or he would not have been in the service of this company for 15 or 16 years. The learned gentleman then narrated the circumstances preceding the stranding of the ship, as they are detailed in Captain Valler's evidence. It might reasonably be asked how, in such weather, v ith a tempestuous sea and a dark and hazy night, Captain Valler had not continued to take soundings in a position where the perils of the navigation were a matter of notoriety? It appeared to him that the lead ought to have been repeatedly used after the Portland Lights had dipped. The depths varied from 32 to as low as 4 and 6 fathoms of water; but CaDtain Valler had not used the lead from the time of passing the 1Portland Lights till the steamer was stranded. It would be for the niagistrates to consider whether this neglect had contribated to the disaster. If it could be proved that it did not no one would rejoice more than he should if Captain Valler left the court without a stain upon his professional character. On the contrary, no matter how high and flattering his testimonials might be, they were bound, in justice to the public, as they valued the safety of life and property, not to be influenced in his favour by those testimonials, batt to make such a report as justice and the facts of the case would warrant.
Aftersonie discussion between Mr. O'Dowd and Afr. Coxwell, who appeared for Captain Valler,
Captain WiUiam Valler was sworn, and stated that he was master of the Tyne, and had a certificate of competency under the Board of Trade. Had been engaged in the navigation of vessels as master for 18 years, 15 of which were in the service of the Royal Mail Company. Had been at sea 29 years in all. Substituted the Trinity Board certificate for the one he obtained under the Board of Trade. Had commanded the Tyne two voyages to the Brazils and seven to the WVest Indies. On the last homeward voyage left Pernambuco on the 23d of December. Had 63 passengers and a small cargo. All the passengers were boound for Southampton, and were nearly aU first-claas. The passenger trade is an important part of the trade between the Brazils and Southampton. They took out about 180 passengers on the last voyage. They had very strong bead winds nearly the whole of the passage home. .Nothing particular happened till the morning of the 12th. Saw Usliant Light about 5 o'clock in the morning. (The logbook was here asked for by Mr. O'Dowd, and handed in to the Court.) The handwriting in the logbook is the chief-officer's. The logbook is siade up every watch, from the entries on the logslate by the officers on watch, and witness puts his signature when satisfied of the correctness of the entries. Observed Ushant Light about 15 minutes after 5, bearing E. by N. ij N. After seeing Ushant Light shaped the course of the ship to N.E., and kept in that direction till 7 o'clock, and then altered to E. by N. l N., which was the direction for Portland. The weather became thick. At 11 30 a.m. sounded, and on lifting up the lead found they had no bottom at 40 fathoms. At 4 in the afternoon sounded again, and found 46) fathoms sand and shells. At G, found 41 fathoms, sand. At 8, 36 fathoms, coarse ground. Was about 40 miles from Portland at this time. Sighted the Portland Lights at 1120 p.m., and 10 minutes afterwards altered the course of the ship to eastward, to shape her course to the Needles. At midnight stopped the engines and sounded, to ascertain the distance from Portland Lights; found 30 fathoms, coarse groand. That he consideretl put him about 12 miles to the southward of Portland Race. The vessel was then going slow, and had been from the afternoon previous. By the log was going about 7 knots. The wind was B S.E. at this tilmie. Saw the Portland Lights again at 1 a.m. on the 13th, bearing N.N.E. 1 B. At 1 40 the lights boreN, and at2 1S saw the two lights in one, bearing N.N.W. 4 W. At 2 25 the lights dipped, bearing N.W. by N. i N. The weather came on very thick and hazy, but for which they would have been able to see the lights longer. Had no lights at this time by which to steer. Did not sound afterwards. He did not consider this part of the Channel imore perilous than any other part. There was not *miuch variation in the depths of the Channel between Portland and the Needles. Looking at the chart he found from 12 to 17 fathoms at the south of Kimmeridge Ledge. If there were onily 4 fathoms at any place it must be within a cable's length-quite close to the Ledge. He found one part marked 6, and 17 close to it. Wason deck all night. Did notleave fiveminutestogether, just to go down to the cabin to examine the charts. Was not in the habit of communicating with the helmsman, hut through the officer on duty. The second-officer was oa duty that night. Depended upon the steering, making an allowance for the inset, to keep the ship clear of everything. By the inset he meant the effect of a wind and tide upon the bow of the ship, which, as she was light and going at half speed, was calculated to send the ship in. As it proved, he did not make sufficient allowance for this. If it had not been for the fog he should have kept the ship more to the east. Was as familiar as any master could be with that part of the Channel. Tho vessel might have etruck even if he had made regular soundings from 1 o'clock onwards, because they might have gone withiR a mile of the ridge, and got the same depth of water-16 orl17 fathoms-as outside of St. Alban's Head, and in a fair way for the Needles. If he had sounded and found 16 fathonis he shou.ld have considered himself in a safe position. If he had sounded and found 9 fathoms, he should not have considered it safe, and should have hauled out to the southward. Should not have considered 12 fathoms dangerous if he had passed St. Alban's Head, which he thought he had. The vessel had three compasses, which he found to agree very well, and he threw no blame on them. He attributed the disaster to the combined causes he had named, and the spring tides must have been running five to six mlles an hour. Did ;not know this at tho time, and had no idea that they would run so strong. About 20 minutes to 4 o'clock on the morning of the 13th, after losingsight of the Portland Lights, and finding it come on
very thick and hazy he went to the coin pasiion door, with the intention of going to the engineer of the watch to desire him to pump the boilers up, as he intended to stop at 4 o'clock. He had the door in his hand when he heard the officer on watch call out, "hard a-port," and supposed at the time it was a vessel crossing thesn. He rushed from the companion door to abreast of the engine-room, the officer of the watch at the same time calling out " hard a-port." Asked him what was the mnatter, and be said there were breakers on the ort bow. Witness imniediately called out to stop her. Before the ship's way was stopped he felt her graze along the rocks, and the next moment she was hard and fast. Turned the engines astern, and
found they could not move her, kept the engines going for some time, but, finding she did not come off, cleared away the boats, They then prepared to run an anchor out astern ; lowered the three lifeboats, the mail boat, the cutter, and the gig; sent them outside the surf and anchored theni. 'ihere was a very heavy westerly swell when the vessel struck, and the fog was so tbick that the land could not be made out for half an hoer afterwards. It was nearly low water. He frequently examined the compasses from the time they ceased taking soundings.
Mr. O'Dowd.-I am bound to ask the question-Were you sober on that niht 7
Captain Valler.- wavs perfectly sober. I am not in the 9atf getting drunk.
Mul O'Dowd.-.I wasbound to ask the question, and was fuly pepaed or hatanswecr.
aptain Walker said he thought there was no doubt of
Lhtsbeing well navigated till they reached the Portland ByCpanWle..It was his practice to compare the compases and crecte by observations twomo he tims -da. heeains were always taken by the standard cosopasse, essdee theO Yariationa in the Chiannel to be
24 degrees, to which he added five or six degrees. It was therefore necessary to allow an error of 29 or 30 degrees alto ether. That applies to an easterly course. Took a kind of hand bearing, and could not estimate correctly within a quarter of a point. From the time of leaving Ushant till they sighted Portland took soundings every two hours, and the engines were "'slowed" from 4 o'clock in the afternoon. The weather was getting very thick and hazy, and he reduced to half speed, in case of crossing any ship making down ChanneL The fog canie over justas they lost sight of the Portland Lights. When the lights were seen in one he knew pretty well his position, and did not think it necessary to take soundings, only he could not estimate their distance exactly. Had made many voyages in cominand of the Royal Mail Company's ships, and was weL acquainted with the ChanneL It was high water between Portland and St. Alban's between 10 and 11 o'clock. The steamer went ashore on the morning of the 13th, about three days after the full moon. It would therefore be low water about 6 o'clock. With the two lights in one, and the distance estimated at eight or 10 miles, he shaped the ship's course east, and continued that course until the ship struck. In estimating an easterly course he would allow 80 degrees to the north. In steering that course he estimated it would take the ship five miles from St. Alban's Head. The distance from the BiU of Portland to St. Alban's is about 15 miles. When the ligbts dipped they were considerably to the eastward of the Bill an much nearer to St. Alban's.
Captain Walker.-According to the Admiralty chart the spring tides run about 31 knots an hour. You think they were rather stronger on this occasion? Witness.-Yes.
By Captain Walker.-Did not think that if he had kept on sounding the ship would have been kept out of danger, as the ground was the same till within about a mile from the shore. They might have hove the lead in 17 fathoms, and in 10 minutes have been in 14 fathoms. If he had kept in 14 fathoms the ship would not have been in danger, but he would not have approached less. If the man had been kept constantly in the chains during the two hours after sig ting Portland the soundings might have indicated the approach of danger, but he did not think they would have saved the ship, as the water shoaled so suddenly. After losing sight of the lights, and judging the vesel to be in a correct position, he thought it useless to sound, and steered by compasses only. Hlemade allowance for the ebb tide, and considered the variation a quarter of a point. There would be a set of four or five mies' tide. The vessel was going at seven miles.
Captain Walker.-I wish to repeat my question. If you had kept the lead constantly going from the time the lights dipped would you not have had sufficient warning that you were approaching the land-would it not have indicated danger?
Captain VaUer.-I think it would not, as there are 14 fathoms within a mile of land. I should not have considered 14 fathoms dangerous, but I might have hauled out a little.
Captain Walker.-Then, Captain Valler, I am to suppose the heaving the lead is no guide for a ship going down Channel?
Captain Valler.-I do not think it of any use to heave a hand-lead in the Channel in shaping a ship's course. If you consider yourself in a dangerous position the lead may be of use. I used the lead every two hours in crossing from Usbant to Portland, in accordance with the company's regulatVons.
Captain Walker.-If you considered it necessary to use the lead where the whole Channel was open to you, did you not think it more necessary when you got into the Channel ?
Captain VaUer.-I did not think it necessary. The regulations of the company are on entering the Channel to take soundings every t wo hours
By Mr. LOBBs.-I am not aware that we are required to sound more frequently when nearing land.
By Captain Wtalker-If he had sounded and got 14 fathoms, he would have hauled her out to the southward. He would have considered himself to the eastward of St.
By Captain BRnToN.-In 14 fathoms the ship might have been saved.
Captain Walker.-You must be aware, Captain VaUer, that on getting into the Channel every precaution ought to have been taken,
Captain Valler.-I did take every precaution I thought necessary.
Captain Walker.-I have no doubt you did what you thought right at the time,
Captain Valler said that such a circumstance as St. Alban's Head not being seen at two cables' length would not happen once in 20 years.
Captain Walker here read an extract from a book of the company's regulations, requiring that onapproachingthe land, or entering a port or roadstead, with or without a pilot on board, two leads should be kept constantly sound-
ing.
At the desire of Captain Walker Captain VaUlle then described the conduct of the Coastguard. After the ship got ashore they fired guns, rockets, and bluelights, which drew the attention of the Coastguard, and they came off about an hour afterwards. Mr. Bath, the chief boatman, boarded the ship, and from him witness ascertained her position. By the time he had come oKf the flood tide had begun to make. They got one of the ship's boats under the bows, and put a stream anchor into it. With the assistance of Mr. Bath's boat, and another which had come from the St. Alban's station, the cutter was taken in tow, with the intention of running the anchor out astern, to heave the ship off- but, in consequence of the very strong flood tide, the boats were all swept away, and they were prevented doing so. To get their own boat back to the ship they were obliged to heave the anchor overboard, The sea was getting up at the time. The boats remained outside of the surf, the head boatman being left on board. They then found that, in consequence of the heavy sea getting up, it was not prudent to lower any more boats, or or the passengers to land. They then waited till the tide ebbed with all the passengers on board. Some of the passengers were landed in the Coastguard boat, some in a smail dingy belonging to the estate, and others in the company's boats. The steamer had nine boats altogetherfour lifeboats, two cutters, a gig, a mailboat, and a dingy. Did not consider there was at any time any hiiminent danger to the passengers while they remained on board. There would have been if they had landed when first they wished it.
By Mr. CoxwelL-It was more necessary to sound in crossin~ the Channel, in order to indicate the approach of land. he same necessity does not exist in an equal degree between headland and headland. The distance from Ushant to Portland was about 160 miles, and there the soundings would indicate a ship's position. The soundings would not vary much in laying the course from Portland to the Needles. That was what he meant when he said that the lead would be useless. On the chart he saw 17 Pathoms marked within half a-mile of St. Alban's Read, and 19 within three-quarters of a mile; also 14 fathoms close to the Head, within an eighth of a mile. The ebb tide sets rather stronger on the head than on the beam of the ship in the course they were steering, and therefore they would not get the full effect of the ebb in the deviation of their coure. It would rather affect their distance than their cosition. On the previous voyage from Ushant he steered half a point nearer, on account of the difference of wind.
ByCaptain BRETONt. -Was not aware of any regulation requinngthemot to get under 22 fathoms off St. Alban's
There might be for sailing ships, but it was not requisite for steamer. If steamers were always to keep out in 22 fathoms in the Channel, they would often notreach their destination.
Mr. Charles Augustine White, chief officer of the Tyne, was next sworn, and stated that he had been 11 years and 4 months in the company's service. Had heard Captain V aller's examination and his description of the state of the weather, and there was nothing which he could add. He came on deck the moment the ship struck.
Captain WValker.-If the lead had been hove within Portland, might the ship have been saved?
Witness.-I can't answer that.
Captain Walker.-Areoyou incompetent, or do you decline to answer ?
Witness.-I decline to answer.
Captain Walker.-I presumie, when you were appointed chie officer, you were considered competent to take the place of the master. Now, I ask, in your opinion, whether, if the lead had been constantly hove after passing Portland, the ship might have been saved?
Witness.-It is possible the lead would have kept her out of danger. I think it might.
By Mr. Coxwell.-I only declined to answer the question at first, because I thought I was not compelled to do so.
Mr. William Algernon Wright, third officer. -Had been in the service of the company nearly five years. Had heard Ca tamn Valler's evidence. He considered that if the lead had been hove within Portlaiid it would have been an additional precaution. Had he been in charge of the ship, and the weather as thick as it was when she struck, he should have hove the lead. The captain always gave orders when the lead was to be hove. The ship had no sails set. He was in the fore rigging when the ship struck. He saw something just before, but did not know it was land.
By MIr. Coxwell.-Had sailed with Captain Valler about six months. Captain VaUler was always very Particular and regular in taling altitudes and azimuths. lad never sailed with a more careful captain. Had always found him scrupulously cautious in avoiding danger. Iie is a very able and e.xperienced commander.
By Mr. O'Dowd. -The most able and experienced commanders sometimes err. If I had been in command of the ship I should have actedi in a similar manner to Captain Vailer, but have hove the lead.
John O'Brien stated that he was quartermaster on board the Tyne. He relieved the wheel at 2 o'clock. He was directed tosteerE. and by N. by the steeringcompass. Continued to do so till the ship struick. The binnacle compaw and the steering compass were nearly 20 yards apart. The officer of the watch frequently looked at the compasses.
By Mr. Coxwell.-HIad sailed with Captain Valler for 12 months, and often with other captains, but never knew one more careful. It was very unusual in any ship he a been in to sound along the coast. The use of the lead was to indicate the approach to land. They knew where they were then.
By Mr. O'Dowd.-He should think it necessary as a precaution, to heave the lead in thick and hazy weather wheh near the shore.
Captain William Vincent was next sworn and examined by Captain Walker.-He stated that he was the superintendent of the Royal Mail Company at Southampton, and had been so for four years. He was a master in the navy, and had commanded one of the company's ships for ten years Captain Valler has been several years in the coi. pany's service. He was once chief officer with wit. ness, and a very good and careful officer he always found him. He produced a book of instructions issued by the company for their officers. One of those instractions was to sound every two hours, and to keep the lead constantly going on approaching land or entering a
harbour. Captainl Valler had one of *hese books, and other officers were supplied with them. ,a te
Captain Walker.-Do you consider that Captain Valler actea in accordance with the company's instructions on, this occasion, or as a prudent commander should have acted when the weather became thick ?
Captain Vinvcnt.-I do not. He should either have hauled the ship off the shore, with her head to the southward, or have stopped and got a correct cast of the lead. Had the weather been clear, it would not have beg. xe
quired to do either, because the land would have been seen. I consider the stranding of the Tyne is attributable to the fact of Captain VaUler not making due allowance for the strong ebb tide that was running from the time he passed Portland ntil the ship got on shore. The tide would be at least fonr points on his bow and the wind about two ; both acting on a light ship woold send her to leeward more than half the speed ghe was going through the water. I have carefully examined Captain Valler's course on his chart, which was a correct one, supposing there was no tide. Had there been a flood, instead of an ebb, it would, of course, have sent the ship off the shore, instead of on.
Captain Walker.-Then, you consider the loss of the Tyne is the result of want of judgment on the part of Captain Valler s
Captain Vincent.-I consider it was the want of forethought on Captain Valler's part, in not making suffcient allowance for the tide.
Captain Walker.-Notwithstanding this omission, do you think that the accident might have been avoided by paying proper attention to the lead?
Captain Vincent.-Certainly I do.
By Mr. Coxwefl-Up to the time of his arrival off Portland Captain Valler had acted in accordance with his instructions. Had the weather kept clear there would have been no necessity to heave the lead after making the land, but there would have been a breach of the company's regulationsin not doing so. The regulations do require that the lead should be hove while running along the shore. Witness had known Captain Valler a great many years. He considered him one of the most careful commanders they had in the service, and he was the last man whom he should have supposed would have lost a ship, as be knew that he made it a patice never to leave the deck when his ship approachedthe land. Was well acquainted with the tides in the ChanneL His knowledge of the tides enabled him to say that under circumstances there was a considerable difference in the force of the tides, but not in the direction, unless you approach the coast, particularly at St. Alban's Head, because after the ebb tide passes the Head it runs along the coast N.W. by W.
Captain Walker thought it right to stte that they found no fault with Captain Valler up to the time of his arrival off Portland, and that they were thoroughly satisfied with his antecedents.
Mr. O'Dowd said there was no more evidence to offer.
lMr. Coxwell said he was so perfectly satisfied with the fairness and impartiality with which the investigation had been conducted that he would not occupy the time of the Court with any observations; and after the remarks of Captin Walker, expressing satisfaction with Captain VaZler's antecedents, he hasdly thought it necessary to trouble them with the numerous testimonials he had.
Captain Vincent said he had seen Captain Valler's testinonials, and they were of the highest character.
Mr. O'DowdL-If you like to forward them to the Board of Trade, Mr. Coxwell, they will receive every consideration.
Ca tam BREroT.-Or, if you like to leave them with the Ben , we will forward them with our report.
Mr. Coxwell.-I wiU avail myself of the opportunity.
The inquiry was brought to a conclusion a little before 6 o'clock.

The Income-Tax.
THE INVCOME-TAX.
CRIPPLEGATF. WTT1T4TN ANT) WVPWT)TTn
Yesterday a crowded meeting of the inhabitauts of these two wards was held in the school-room, Philip-lane, Londonwall, for the purpose of consideringthe propriety of petitioning for'the repeal of the acts of Parliament which increased the income and property tax fron 7d. to is. 4d. in the pound, and for obtaining a more equitable adjustment or a total repeal of the tax upon incomes arising from trades and professons.
Mr. T. CHALLIS, M.P., alderman of the ward, occupied the chair, and complained of the injustice of the tax as it operated on persons whose incomes were precarious, and who had to toil hard to obtain sufficient to support themselves and families. The mode of assessing the tax was bad, but, to say nothiug of that, the increased part of it should be repealed, for it was put on to assist the Government in prosecuting the late war, and it should have ceased with the war.
Mlr. F. BEIt,OCH moved the first resolution, to the effect that, inasmuch as the income-tax was increased from 7d. to Is. 4d. m the pound for the purpose of carrying on the late just and necessary war, the continuance of the same at its present amount after the present financial year is, in the opinionof this meeting, most unnecessary and unjustifiable.
Mr J. P. Fosr econded the motion, which was carried unanimously.
hr. JoHs PARK;ER then moved the following resolution :
"1That this meeting desiresto record its decided oreferesce of direct over indisret twxatien, and is of opinion that the tax ou property and in~comnes, faisly and eqjuitably adjusted, will .asble thu Governiment to giTe the trading and industrial classes of the country Important relief.
by aboiaLing taxes which press hearily on the eonsuimers of many articles of commerce and, which evidently tend to retard the general prosperity of the country."
The motion was seconded by Mr. W. MORICE, and agreed to, as was also the third resolution, on the motion of D.puty LLOYD, seconded by Mr. RonB!soS,

TOTNES.
A public meeting of tbe inhabitants of this town. convened by the Mayor, Mr. James Gill, was held inthe Gauild-
ha, on Tuesday, to consider the propriety of petitioning Parliament to abolish the Income-tax. The Mayor presided.
Mr. CniDISG (solicitor) moved the first resolution, to the effect " That in the opinion of this meeting the additions made to the property and income tax for war purposes ought to cease from the 5th of April next, and, consequently, that the acts of Parliament imposing those additions should be immediately and unconditionally repealed."
Mr. GILLARD seconded the motion, which was carried unanimously.
AIr. WWDEATT (solicitor) moved the following resolution :
" That the present ustem of levying the Income-tax by taxlng permanent and precarious incomes alike is maniefstly unjust, and leaeds to a genemal and systematic evasion; that the despotic and inquisitorial monds of assessment is repugnant to the feeling of Englismen, and has only been ubmintted to from time to time under the impressiont that the tax was for a temporary puxrpose ; andI that the meeting pledges itself to use every legitimate means to oLtain a more equitable
adjustment of the tax and an improvement in tbo mode of assessment or M total repeal of It upon trades or professiors."
tr. KELLOC;K (solictor) seconded the resolution, which was also carried.
It was then resolved to embody the foregoing resolutions in a petition to the House of Commons, and that the two members of the borough, Earl of Gifford and Mr. Mills, be requested to support its prayer.
KNARESBOROUGH.
A meeting of the inhabitants was held at the Courthouse, on Tuesday, for the purpose of considering the propriety of petitioning Parliament for the abolition or a reduction of the Income-tax. There was a respectable attendance, including the two members for the borough, Mr. J. D. Dent and Mr. B. T. Woodd. The Rev. Thomas Collins, rural dean, presided ; and the meeting was unanimous in condemning the present mode of levying the tax, and in declaring that the extra Od. in the pound for the war expenses ought to be tken offon the 1st of April next. Resolutions to this effect were adopted, and also a petition to the House of Commons._
LANCASHIRE.
A large meeting was held last night against the incometax at Bury, Lancashire. M1r. Frederick Peel, liLP., was present, and said he thought the Chancellor of the Exchequer would endorse fuUy the opinion expressed by the meeting to reduce the tax to 7d. from the 5th of April next.

THE EARL OF HAREWOOD.-The latest medical
THE EARL oF HAREWOOD.-The latest medical bulletin issued from Harewood-house is as follows:-" The Earl of Harewood has passed another good night, and his Lordship is going on satisfactorily.-Harewood-house, Thursday morning, Jan. 29."
THE JUSTICEROOM AT THE MANSION-HOUSE.-The late important investigations which have taken place at the Msnsion-house have exhibited in the most striking manner the inconveniences resulting from the want of accommodation in the place, and its remarkable inaptitude for the transaction of the public business. There is but one room appropriated for the numerous affidavits and declarations made by merchants, bankers, and others; and consequently when witnesses are required to be out of court unng an inquiry they are crowded into the same room, WhiCh is by no means large enough for the accommodation of the additional persons. The small room which is allotted to the chief clerk has been on each occasion occupied by the gaolers and convicts, the latter of whom it was necessary to keep separate from the general public. Thus many officers widows and other ladies who are obliged to make applcations connected with the receipt of their pensions are subjected to great annoyance, and the entrance to the couIrtbecomes much obstructed by the pressure of the crowd. The extent of the inconvenience will be under. stood better when it is recollected that the sittings were unusually protracted, and even the officials connected with the court could not contrive to take the refreshment which nature required, and which became doubly necessary in consequence of the heated and oppressive atmosphere of the apartment. It is believed to be the only police-comrt in London in which such meagre accommodation is given, and Captain Williams, the Government Inspector of Prisons, has severely condemned it.
RoYAi FREE HOSPITAL.-At the annual Court of Governors of this hospital, held on Tuesday, from the report which was read by the secretary it appears that the handiome and commodious new wing, erected as a memorial to the late Duke of Sussex, was formally opened in June last by Lord Leigh, the auspicious event being celebrated by a bnqnet held in Freemasons'-hall, the financial result of which was the munificent sum of 1,0l01. to the charity. The committee acknowledge with respectful gratitude the receipt of an additional donation during the past year of 1001. from Her Majesty, and also a liberal contribution from the Duke of Cambridge. The committee most thankfully recognize in the considerable augmentation of the past year's contributions, the public approval of the free principle, as well as its
andid appreciation of the professional skil and general i conomy by which the hospital has been conducted, and they respectfully express their conviction, founded upon the experience of nearly 30 years, that the system of free I dmission of patients is the only effective mode of *ealing with the combined misfortunes of disease and eestitution. The number of in-patients admitted during the year 1856 amounts to 1,044, being a great increase as compared with the return for the year 1855. The outpatients for the same period were 43,443, being an increase of 4,354 over the corresponding retura for the previous year. The total numnber of patients of beth sexes for the year 1856 amounted to 46,487. The total income of the year from all sources is 9,3161. 5s. 6d., out of which sum, ater payment of numerous current charges of the hospital and the sum of 1,3001. for the new buildings (5,2001, including 1,6001., the amount of the Sussex fund, being paid in 1855, there being still owing to the builders 6001, the sum of 4,1441. 15s. 6d. bas been apphed to the liquidation of outstanding lia~ilitirs,

Emigration.
EfIGRATION. I
TO TEE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES.
Sir,-Would that you could have witnessed the grateful emotion with which the little band of honest and sober, yet almost destitute working men whom I met last night at No. 42, Clerkenwell-green, spoke of your masterly article of yesterday, and of my far less valuable letter which you were so gooad as to publish in your issue of Tuesday, in favour of a free passage to the colonies for those who are starving and perishing in this country for want of employment, although in character neither idle nor criminal!
F They were also much encouraged by the manner of their
reception by the Lord Mlayor, and their wan cheeks flushed as they told me of his kindness nd sympathy and of his promise to do everything in his power, publicly and privately, to further their cause.
Your powerful aid, Sir, has done wonders. The hope of obtaining what, I contend, is the right of these men and of their sisters in adversity is cheering and sustining the hearts of thousands, and has I know already been the cause of a large secession of the most intelligent of the adherents and followers of the violent and ignorant men whose object is to send, if not to lead, the masses maddened by hunger and despair into a hopeless conflict with the authorities.
It is now, Sir, for powerful individuals, but, above all, for the Government to act, and noble and statesmanlike is the work they are catted upon to do ; there may be difficulties, hut they must be boldly met and surmounted. The colonies wvil, I am sure, if matters are properly managed, most willingly and generously cooperate.
I have had considerable experience of the working classes, both as an employer of labour and as an officer of the militia. I have seen much in them to love and respect; and, humble as are my ability and influence, I cannot stand by and see "this happy breed of men" depressed, despairing, and desperate, when a remedy for their distress exists of which we are urged to avail onrselves by every principle of justice and sound policy.
I have no desire to parade my name in yonr paper, but you are at liberty to give it to anyone asking for it.
I remain, Sir, your most obedient servant.

The Law Of Divorce.
rTHE LAWIV OP DIvORcE.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I rely upon the candour by wbich your journal is distinguished for the insertion of this letter in your columns.
In your able review of the Hnn. Mrs. Norton's letter to the Queen, with which you have done uie the honour ro associate A rerico of the Dirorce BiM of 1856, I find some strictures on my publication which call for a fewv words of explanation. I do not refer without reason to your wholesale condemnation of a series of 20 " propositions for an amendment of the laws affecting married persons," on several of which much diversity of opinion exists. On the subject of the 19th, "That the marital right of a husband shall be restricted," described by you to be "' vague and unmeaning," I remember to have read yonr powerful article in July last, which elicited the opposite judgment of a popular writer in a contemporary journal. Nor do I complain of expressions whicb, however severe, may possibly be true. Yet, if they be, it seems extraordinary that a pam. phlet which exhibits ignorance, "sheer nonsense,' and " no ability," should have been at all noticed by The Tima.
You state, Sir, that I am "so gallant a man that (ignorant or forgetful of poorfJohn M1iltoenand his solitary home)" " I cannot conceive the possibility of a wife deserting her husband unless under pressure of the Mormon mania." The passage to which you refer occurs In a note subjoined to the proposition, that divorce a mcrsd should be granted to a wife who has been deserted by her husband for two years. infidelity forming no part of her ^omplaint. This note aUudes to desertion by a wife, on which Lord Brongham remarked that " The law of Scotland gave the same remedy to the wife for the desertion of the husband as the husband would have for what was not so likely to happen-the desertion of the wife." The Mormon mania was mentioned as an example only of such desertion; and, in proposing an alteration of the law, it is surely as fit to adduce a modern instance as to cite an ancient case.
With regard to the igroranced of law wherewith Iam charged, I apprehend that if a married lady be robbed of her diamonds the stolen property must be laid in the indictment as being the property of her husband, who therefore is the prosecutor; and that, in an information or indictment for libel, or in an action for defamation, the person libelled or slandered being a married woman, the husband must be named as moving or joining in the prosecution or action. If, then, "a wife divorced from her husband by the ecclesiastical court, or deserted by or separated from him," "be robbed, libelled, or slandered," and the husband refuse to move or concur in or disclaim the prosecution or action, where is the wife's remedy ?
In your judgment, Sir, some of my propositions "u nnecessarily introduce topics of strife; as that which would make adultery an indictable offence." Those who may read the pamphlet which you have reviewed will find that I am not the originator of this proposal, but that many wise and great men of the present and past generations have expressed the same opinion.
lhave not asserted in the publication which you indude in the category of "a claptrap cry about woman's rights," that the " imperfections " of the " law of husband and wife " " are aU in favonr of the husband." I have objected to the law which declares that "if a man marry a woman in debt, he becomes liable to the whole of her debts." I have opposed the practice of the courts by which "if after marriage she sue him in the ecclesiastical court upon some foolish quarrel in which there have been bickerings on both sides, the husband will have to pay not only his own costs but also the bills of the proctors and lawyers who have perhaps stirred up the strife." Nor have I affirmed that
mere incompatibility of temper" should be "a ground for divorce."
With you, I have argued that " if an absolute divorce and a capacity to remarry followed, the interests of society and of the offspring of the first marriage would require that the present rule should be modified." With you, I have contended that a court of divorce shon'd "award for cruelty or desertion a separation which shall restore both parties to their formal civil rights, making such apportionment of property as the circumstances of the case may justify."
"Surely," you exclaim, "these are rational demands." Wherefore, then, your sweeping declaration, after having " read these 20 propositions with care," " that they are not calculated to assist the object of a rational reform in the present law of husband and wife "
You consider, Sir, that "putting the dogmatists aside, there are still three parties who must be heard upon this divorce question." L " The great mass" of those who live in happy marriages. 2. "The lMltonians" who "groan in bitterness in the bondage of an il-assorted umon." 3. " Those who, without fault themselves, are united to partners with whom it would be infamous or unsafe to live."
The second class of sufferers are disposed of by the admission that " mere incompattbility of temper" ought not to be " a graund for divorce. ' Certainly they will find few advocates. The first class, " the bhlk and mass of the householders of England," justly "hate the very name of divorce." The law, they think-perhaps truil -needs little or no amendment for them ; but that is no reason why they should oppose the just claims of the third, most suffering, class. It is in favour of an amendment of the laws for their benefit that I have mainly addressed my suggestions.
In speaking of this third class you observe tbat "' these persons ask little more'than the Government bil of last session offered. They ask that a man shall obtain a divorce for adultery in his wife, and a woman for habitual adultery in her husband." The Government bill of 1856 offered no such relief to a woman. It provided only that any wife should be at liberty " to present a petition to thie Court of Divorce praying that her marriage might be dissolved, on the ground that her husband had, since the celebration thereof, been guilty of incestuous adultery." The bill, as amended by the select committee, added as lawful grounds of divorce a ,ineuto on than part of a wife, bigauy, adultery, and cruelty, and adultery with desertion for four years; h ut it contained no provision for " habitual adultery in a
" The police magistrate-s," you further observe, "already exercise an imperfoct power of granting separation and alimony." Imperfect, indeed, an committing a husband to prison for brutal ill-treatment of his wife, or for non-nayment of a wretched, scanty allowance, to prevent her frm
"cumnbering the pariah in which sha resides."X
I agree with you, Sir, that " we should approach thse subject in a temperate and impartial spirit, " and " with an earnest desire to remove injustice, wherever injustice is occasioned by the law." [ have endeavoured to write on this subject " in a temperate and impartial spirit ;" I have anxiously sought for juctice on the principles of truth, hut, like many wiser and better men, it is my fate to find that, in the judgment of The Times, I have altogether failed.
I am. Sir. your obedient ssrvant
