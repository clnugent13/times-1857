House Of Commons, Wednesday, Feb. 11.
P ABLIA MENTARY INTELLIGENCE.
HROUSE OF COMMONS, WEDNESDAY, FEE. 11.
The SPFA.KER took the chair at 12 o'clock.
Petitions praying for the repeal or modification of the Income-tax were presented by Sir E. LACON, from the corporation of Great Yarmouth, and also from the inhabitants of Great Yarmouth; by Lord STANLEY, from the inhabi. tant of King's Lynn ; and by Mr. TisoRrNELy, from inha bitants of Wolverhamnpton ; and one by Mr. K5NNAIRD, from the civil servants of the Crown attached to the port of Perth, praying for further improvements of the scale of superannuation allowances set forth in the bill of the last session of Parliament.
PRIVATE BILLS.
A considerable number of private bills were read asecond time and ordered to be comnitted.
The second reading of the Birkenhead Docl5s (Construction) Bill having been moved,
Mr. M. GIBSON said he had at first thought there were grounds for oyosing this bill and its successor-the Birkenhead Docks (oanagement) Bill-but upon consideration ho was not inclined to resist the second reading.
Mr. G. M. BUTT suggested that the two bills, together with the Mlersey Conservancy and Dock Bill, should be l-eferred to one committee, as they all related to one subject.
The bill was then read a second time, as was also tha Birkenhead Docks (Management) Bill.
MERSEY CONSERVANCY AND DOCKS BILL,
Mr. GIBSON having moved the second reading of this bill,
Mr. HORSFALL rose to oppose it, as a measure of a most monstrous character. The bill contained what professedtj be a history of the constitution of the Dock Trust, the Dock Committee, the Corporation, the Conservancy and Pilot Comnmissions of Liverpool and other statements of a similar kind, and u on the suggestion of two self-constituted bodies in Mauchester the Souse was now asked to abrogate the powvers held by those different aiuthorities under various acts of Parliament, and to substitute for them a body of 21 persons, to be elected by the dock rat,payers. No charge of injustice or neglect of duty had been made against any one of those bodies which it was now sought to destroy, and no case had been made out for terminating a system w.hich had hitherto been so wvell admninistered. The composition of the Dock Trust of Liverpool was not exactly understood either in that house or out of it. The trusteea were 12 chosen from the town-council and 12 elected by the dock ratepayers; and the body thus composed had acted usefully and for the benefit of the commerce of Liverwol and of tho whole country. It was, however, not at all surrising that there should be some misapprehension abroad as to the constitution of the Dock Trust, seeing that the august Board of Trade itself had been deceived, and had stated to the world, in a report dated A1ril, 1856, that the Dock Committee was composed as
folows
" Twelve members are elected by the council of the borough and 12 by the dock ratepayers; but no person can be elected a member who has not both resided in or within eight niles of Liverpool for five years, and paid rates to the amount of 251. a-year, either on his own account or as an agent for persons residing in or near Liverpool."
The latter statement was the very reverse of the fact, for any agent of a Manchester house, duly qualified, was entitled to vote. No doubt objections would be raised to the 7-do which the town council could exercise upon the proceedings of the Dock Committee, but that edto appeared to him to be an advantageous and cocstitutional power, although it was one not very frequently exercised. Hle found that since 1851 there had been only one instance in which the power of veto had been exercised, and during the last 32 years there had been only 13 such instances, It would also, no doubt, be urged upon the House that purchases of land were made from the corporation by the dock trustees. The fact was true, but what were the conditions ? In 1790 the corporation gave the land and a large sum of money towards the formation of the first dock, and since then whenever any purchaso of land had been made from the corporation for the purposes of the Dock Trust the sales had been based upon one of the four folloving conditions: -Either the land was sold for the same price which the corporation had paid for it, or it was sold for the price which had been paid by other purchasers of land inimediately adjoining, or the sum to be paid was fixed by the verdict of a jury, or it was arrived at by mutual agreement, subject to the consent of the Lords of the Treasury. All those modes of dealing were, he conitended, fair and equitable. Another argument would be no doubt raised, that the corporation of Liverpool had purchased the Birkenhead Docks, but had not carried out their engagement to transfer those docks to the Liverpool Dock Trust. The fact was, the Birkenhead Docks, being in a state of insolvency, were purchased by the corporation of Liverpool upon the distinct understanding that whenever the Dock Trust was in a position to make the purchase the docks should be transferred to them; but from that time to the present the Dock Committee had never been in a position to purchase them, although the corporation had always been and still was willing to transfer the Birkenhead Docks, and place them formaly, as they already were practically, under one management with the Liverpool docks;, and the object of one of the bills which had just been read a second time was to assimilate the rates and charges in both docks. The corporation had paid 1,443,0001. for the Birkenhead docks, and would have to expnd 1,500,000. more to complete them. A petition had been presented in favour of the bill
to which was attached the seal of the Great Western Railway Company; and on another occasion he would have an opportunity of showing how that seal had been procured. He was quite sure the noble chairman of the company would not have permitted the seal of that body to have been afixed to a petition in favour of a bill which was at variance with all the noble lord's expressed opinions in and out of that house- and he (Mr. Hlorsfall) had receivedia letter signed by a numier of proprietors of that line protesting against what they conceived to be a gross misappropriation of their corporation seal. It was unworthy of t e promoters of the bill to have recourse to such means. It would have been far more creditable to have imitated the straightforward, honourable course which bad been taken by Mr. Pender, he believed, of Manchester, who had sent out a vessel yesterday without payment of dues, and therefore was prepared to test in a court of law the right of the corporation of Liverpool to levy them. Such a course, he repeated, would have reflected more credit npon the promoters of the bill than the insidious measures by which they sought to obtain their object. He moved
hat the hl be read a second time that day six months. Mr. J. EWART having seconded the amendment,
Mr. GIBSON expressed his regret that the hon. gentleman had not followed the course which he (Mr. Gibson) bad adopted in regard to the two bils promoted by the Liverpool Corporation, and had not allowed this bill to be sent at once to a select committee where there would be every opportunity of examination into its merits. The hon. meno r had endeavoured to show that something unusual was attempted to be done by this bill, but, in fact, the measure was nothing more than an attempt to carry out recommendations of the Board of Admiralty, of the Tidal Commission, of a committee of the House of Commons, and, above all, the requirements of an act of Farliament. (Hear.) The question of the local dues on shipping was only incidental, and did not constitute the principle of the bill, which was that the docks of Liverpool and Birkenhead should be consoldated into one estate, and that the management and control of them should be vested in one public body of trustees, and it was obviously desirable that such body should be independent of the corporation. (Hear.) To vest the management in the present Dock Trust of Liverpool would be to place the whole trade of the country with that port under the control of the corporation, which would consult only the municipal interests, and thus render the trade of the country tributary to the local interests of Liverpool. Surely that was a subject well worthy of inquiry by a committee of that House, and yet the hon. member for Liverpool wished them not to allow that inquiry, but to reject the bill at once. Let the House consider who constituted at present the man - iag body of the Birkenhead Docks. It was called the Dock Committee, one balf of the members of which were chosen by the town coxicil of Liverpool. The chairman of that coinmittee was selected from those members chosen bythe town council, and all the resolutions of the Dock Committee were liable to be vetoed by the corporation, so that, in fact, the corporation did possess an entire control over the proceedings of that conimittee. In 1855 a committee of that House had expremsed its opinion that it would be for the advantage of the maritime trade of the port of Liverpool amd for the public advantage that the whole dock system on both sides of the Mersey should be placed under one public trust. That committee also niade a special report recommending " That the earliest opportunity should be taken of carefully considering the constitutionof theDockTrustwithreference to the altered circumstances in which it will bh placed in consequence of this amalgamation." Mr. J. Bramley. Moore, a member of that House, and formerly chairman of the Dock Committee, had Eaid that most of the persons lately sent to the town-council of Liverpool were not merchants or dock ratepayers ; that merchants and dock ratepayers ought to have greater influence in the inanagement of the docks thanthey now posseesed; thatthey were the most proper parties to have control, as they were directly interested in the good management of the docks - thattbe power of veto over theproceedings of theDock Committee, possessed by the town-council, was not desirable, as that body was at present constituted, but that if its members were ratepayers and interested in the docks no barm
coul arrise therefrom ; that nearly a million of money had been laid out in the purchase of lands for the construction of dockse that the money had passed between the dock estate and the corporation, and that the corporation were the principal parties who had derived advantage from the dock estate. Mr. Bramley-Moore also pointed out how the
corporation, by buying land, as it were, of itself and paying for it out of the dock dues, levied on the trade of the country, made the trade of the country unfairly contribatory to the estate of the Liverpool corporation. Mr. Chapman, a Liverpool merchant, also stated that the towncouncil M ore most properly the conservators of the interests of the town, but that the intereats of the dock estates were very different from those of the town-the one being of a public and national, the other of a peculiarly Ilocal character ; that the dock estate had beeni made entirely subservient to prmtin the
interests of the corporation estate; that the twe'had e en in a state of antagonism for years; that the dock estate had been pIlundered to an enormous extent ; and that, ii fact, the dock estate had been made a sort of mailch colw to ag-
ramndize the great corporation estate. It was agis the Liverpool corporation mnaldag use of a great pulbalic estate * ~1rflsownpeculiar benefit- that the prmterso hshl

interests were allowed to remain exclusively in the hands cf the Liverpool corporation, their policy would be to prevent the development of tho Birkenhead dock system, to withhold from the public the full benefit to be derived from the natural advantages of the Cheshire shore, to make the Birkenhead docks secondary and subsidiary to the Liverpool; docks, and to take care that no rival port sprang up at Birkenhead to compete with the port of Liverpool. The interests of the public were directly opposite. When the Birkenhead docks were completed 13 millions of money would have been expended out of dock rates, of something like a million a-year, levied on the trade of the country. The corporation of Liverpool, as a corporation, had no more to do rwith that vast property and that large revenue than any private individual. The money to make the docks was supplied by the public, the rates were levied on the public, and the public, no doubt, with a due regard to any just claims which the corporation of Liverpool might be able to establish, had a right to see their interests vested in a responsible board. (Elear.) With regard to the town dues, it was said that this was a bill for carrying out the Local Dues on Shipping Bill, which was abandoned in the last session. It was nothing of the kind. It was impossible to introduce a bill to carry out the recoinmendations of the committee of 1855 without incidentaUy raising the question of the town dues. In that year improvement bills were introduced by the corporation of Liverpool, asking for power to pledge the town dues, in order to raise the necessary funds. Those bils were rejected so far as they pledged the town dues, upon the ground that it was a disputed question whether dues levied on ships and goods carried in ships, though casled town dues, could be
roperly apped to defray the minicipal expenditure of J,iverpool. ut when it was proposed to raise money for the purchase of the Birkenhead dock estate by pledging the town dues the objection of misappropriation did not arise. Mr. Serjeant Wrangham, who was counsel for the Liverpool corporation, said he could hardly conceive a more legitimate purpose to which those dues could be devoted, contributed as they were by vessels frequenting the harbour, than to what were strictly harbour purposes, ansdurder the Birkenhead Dock Act of 1855 authority was given to pledge the town dues in order to raise money to purchase the Birkenhead dock property. When, therefore, it was proposed to transfer the Birkenhead docks and the Liverpool docks to a pubic board, elected by the dock ratepayers, it became necessary incidentaUy to deal with the toNwn dues; but the mode in which thev should be dealt with would bo in the discretion of the coummittee. The House, in agreeine to the second reading of this bill, would pronounce no opinion on the principle of the measure introduced by the right hon. gentleman the Vice-President of the Board of Trade, but merely enable the Manchester Chamber of Commerce and the Commercial Association, who legitimately represented the dock ratepayers of Lancashire and Yorkshire, to have their plan considered as well as the plan of the corporation of LiverpooL He had shown that the corporation had other interests than those of the public, and in simple justice be asked that the public interests should be considered in committee. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. L. DAVIES thought the House would not do justice if they did not allow the biUl to go before the same committee to which the other two biLs would be referred.
MIr. G. E. V. HARCOURT hoped that the amentiment would be withdrawn.
Mr. J. EWART defended the Dock Committee, and, though objecting to the veto of the council, contended that it had never been improperly exercisedL He dissented from the proposal to hand over the management of the docks to a body elected without any qualification, and stated his in. tention to vote for the amen dent
Mr. SPOONER was sorry to differ from the member for Liverpool (Mr. Horsfall), but could not come to the conclusion that this was the same bill as the one introduced last session by the Vice-President of the Board of Trade. He was opposed to any infringement of the charter rights of the corporation of Liverpool; but he believed great complaints were made that the dues imposed harassed and perplexed the operations of trade. A question so complicated could be better considered in committee than by the whole House. (Hear.)
Mr. HEADLAM objected to the clause of the bili transferring the town dues from the corporation to a new body, and thought it would be jnst as reasonable to ask the House to transfer the property of the Great Western Railway Company to the Liverpool town-council, If the hon. member divided he would vote for the amendment.
Mr. HORSFALL withdrew his amendment.
The bill was then read a second time, and ordered to be committed.
LE-WES AND 1CKEIELD RAILWAY BILL. Mr. BRAND moved that this bill be committed.
Sir C. BURRELL objected to the bill, and, fortified by the opinion of Sir W. Cubitt, contended that the course of the line proposed would not be the one most advantageous to the public.
After a short conversation, in which the bill was opposed by Sir W. Jolliffe, Sir J. V. Sheley, and Sir G. B. Pechell, on the ground that a better line might be chosen, and supported hyMr. Brand, Colonel Harcourt, and Mr. Bouverie, who saw no reason why the bill should not go before a select committee,

(A lauigh.)
PASSING TOLLS BILL.
Mr. LOWE (in answer to Mr. James M'Gregor) said it was his intention to proceed with this bil on Friday night after the budget, if he could bring it on before 11 o'clock.
JUDGMENTS EXECUTION BILL.
Mr. CRAUFURD moved the second reading of this bill.
Mr. F. FRENCH wished that Ireland had been struck out of this bill. The mercantile and professional classes of that country had the strongest objections to this biU, and the Irish members had defeated it every year since the present Parliament was summoned. Yet the hon. and learned member for Ayr porsisted im endeavouring to force the measure upon the House. Many of the small traders in Ireland were in the habit of making their purchases in this country, and if the bill passed, and an action were brought against them in this country, they must bring over their witnesses at a ruinous expense to defend it. He had warned the hon. and learned member that he should persevere in his opposition, and he regretted that Ministers had permitted the bill to be reintroduced. He moved that the bill be read a second time that day six months.
Mr. M'MAHON opposed the biU on behalf of England. It proposed to effect a change in the law for which there was not the slightest necessity. A man who had obtained a udgment in England might now issue execution upon it in aelaudby means of a short action, and an Irish creditor might in the same way obtain execution against an English debtor. Wbat would be the effect of the bill with regard to judgments obtained in Scotland? A person holding
' heritable estate" of any kind, or possessing goods in Scotland, was liable to be summoned by - edectal citation," a process which consisted of the proclamation of thc names of the parties to a suit, and the holding up of a triangular piece of paper at the Market Cross of Edinburgh, and which gave the Court of Session power to pre nounce judgment in the cause, A judgment so obtained, in the absence of a defendant, would by this bil be trans ferable to the courts of England and Ireland, so that any gentleman who went to Scotland and took a bit of land or a cabin for the shooting season, or who left behind hin any personal property, such as a gun or a fishing-rod, would be
able to have a judgment obtained by the process of " edictal citation" enforced against him in this country. Again, by the law of Scotland, although not by the law of hngland, owners of mines and factories were answerable fcr injuries done to one of their servants, arising from the neglect of another of their servants. If the present bill became law the owners of factories and mines where accidents had occurred through the negligence of servants, resulting in a great loss of life, might therefore be ruined if they happened to possess any property in Scotland or were ever caught there. Anuother effect of it would be that paupers in Scotla"nd would have power to sue persons of property in Eugland and Ireland without giving security for costs. T he bill was also entirely opposed to all the principles ,of the law respecting the revival of judgments
ant the attachment of real estates. He believed its only object was to carry out the views of some Scotch lawyers by placing the jurisprudence of Scotland on a par with the common law of England, and he should therefore second the amendment.
Mr. BLAND also supported the amendment, ashe thought the bil would only produce confusion and mischief. It would give a greater advantage to an English creditor seeking to enforce his debtagainst the landof an Irish debtor than to an Irish creditor proceeding against an English debtor. It violated the important principle that the judgment of every court should be enforced by the process of that court, and it gave an authority to the Sheriffs' Coiuts of Scotland which was not given either to the County Courts of England or to the Courts of Assistant-Barristers of Ireland.
Mr. HADFIELD snpported the bill, as he thought it would remedy a great defect in the law, which had been long felt by the mercantile classes. He could not agree with the hon. and learned member for Wexford (Mr. M'Mahon), in thinldng that it was a hardship not to allow a man who had left his debts in England unpaid to go shooting in Scotland, (A laugh,) He certainly thought it would be desirable to assimilate the laws of England and Scotland, bat he could not understand why it should be necessary for a man to bring three separate actions-one in England, one in Scotland, and one in Ireland, for the recovery of the same debt.
Mr. GEORGE thought that the measure would be very injuriousto Ireland. There was no reciprocityinit, for Ireland was not a manufactiAng coutry likeEngland, but an agricultural country, and therefore the great pioportion of the debts incurred between the twro conties were debts due to Eglihs credtosfoish debtors atsa out of mercantile
;&a ogiven to the local an ifrioocourtts of Scotland,wvhich was no gie totelclcti ihyo nln ro
Irelaud. There was no objection to the present system, and he should therefore oppose the bill.
Mr. H. HUGHES said, the biUl was founded upon a violation of the principle that the procems of a court should only be used for the purpose of enforcing the judgments of that court, and this was, in his opinion, a fatal objection to it. The question involved in the bill was whether in England, Scotland, or Ireland principles of legislation should be introduced different from those rules which had prevailed in courts of justice time out of mind ? (Hear, hear.)
Mr. J. FITZGERALD said, that the bill was either misunderstood or misrepresented. Some arguments had been used which were unworthy the attention of the House. He had heard it stated that the bill would be injurious to the interests of the bar and of the solicitors of Ireland; but wa-s an imperial measure, providing for the due enforcement of certain rights, to be obstructed for such a reason as that ? (Hear, hear.) It was said that the bil was utterly inconsistent with sound principles; but it was a disgrace to the law, in a country called a united kingdom, that when judgment was recovered in one part of the kingdom a fresh action must be commenced if the person proceeded against removed to or had his property in another portion of the kingdonm. It was not to be tolerated that such a state of things should exist, and the House was bound to assist the creditor inhis remedy againstthedebtor. Notwithstandingthe assertions which had been made to the contrary, the act was perfectly reciprocal. It had been argued by the last speaker that it was quite objectionable to compel a court of justice to enforce judgment when it had not possession of or control of that judgment; but if a copy of the judgment, instead of a memorial, were transmitted, that would constitute as complete a record as the judgment itself. This was the fourth occasion when the bill had come under the consideration of the House, and on every division its principle had been affirmed. He believed that the peril which some hon. members predicted in the operation of the biUl was perfectl.y imaginary. The powers which were thought dangerous m a former bill of the kind had been expunged.
MIr. NAPIER said, that on a former occasion after the bill came from a select committee it was, after a full discussion, rejected. He objected that by some of thegprovisions the claim of a creditor would receive greater vitality than it possessed at present under the law, and that English creditors pursuing a debtor in Ireland would enjoy undue advantages over the Irish creditors. He desired to equalize the law sn England and Ireland, but the present bill did not bear equally impartial on all parties.
The ATTORNEY-GENERAIA said, he had listened with surprise to some of the observations urged against-the bill, founded apparently on the ground that there were more Irish than E4nglish debtors, or upon some technical details in the bill which might require an amendment. With regard to the former class of objections he claimed from Ireland a reciprocity of honesty and integrity. The bill was founded on the great demands of honesty, for it was absurd to compel a man who had obtained a judgment in one tribunal to conmmence his proceeding again in another tribunal in the same kingdom. (Hear, hear.) When the bil was last before the House it contained certain objectionable clauses. They were omitted from the present bill, the object of which was simply to enact that a judgment obtained in England should have the same effect in Ireland and Scotland. He could not concur in the hon. member for Longford's reading of the bil, who objected that the measare would not give to the Irish court the same equitable jurisdiction over the English judgment as was possessed by the Enghsh court, for he conceived that it armed the Irish court with the smine equitable jurisdiction over the English judgment as the Englsh comrt possessed. He also conceived that the objections urged by the right hon. member for Dublin University, founded on technical considerations, proceeded from an erroneous reading of the bill; but, at any rate, they could be removed by the introduction, if necessary, of a few words. The bill was in the interest of the just rights of creditors, both English and Irish, and was Introduced to put an end to an anomaly as absurd as if a judgmnent pronounced in M5iddlesex should not extend into S3urrey. (Hear, hear.)
The House then divided, when there appeared-

The Equalization Of Poor-Rates.
THE EQUALIZATION OF POOR-RATZS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-It was with much sat-sfaction that I read in your impression of Monday a letter from " An East-end Incumbent," urging the adoption of a general metropolitan poorrate in lieu of the present system of parochial poor-rates, and hope that if yon concur in the opinions expressed by him you will not fail to give the subject the benefit of your able advocacy.
Many very large towns have, in respect to the above question, a great advantage over the metropolis, an equal rate being in their case colleted all rbund. We are aware of the chief arguments adduced in favour of local parish rates, as against a national rate; and, without attempting to canvass the correctness of the present principle, as such, I think it would be a just view of its intentions to consider the metropolis and al large towns forthe purposes of poor-rates as parishes or districts of themselves, and not as e>ach posseesing so many miner and distinct districts apart f rom the rest.
The evils of the present parochial system are, I thinLvery apparent, its effect being to lay the heaviest burdens on those least able to bear them.
Thus the wealthy neighbourhoods, by their freeness from the poor, are taxed lightly, their burden diminishing in proportion to the extent to which they can be rid of the poor for the introduction of the rich, this very riddance throwing the greater burden into less favoured parts, -which, by this circumstance, become still less able to bear the weight. In other words, the wealthy have light poor-rates, and the necessitous have heavy.
Now, as the metropolis, as a whole, possesses aU the advantages of a mixed population of rich and poor, high and low, employers and employed (and advaatages these confessedly are), that certainly seems the common-sense reasonable view of the case which would combine the whole into one district for its self-support and general benefit, instead of dividing it into members and sections, thereby implying that each has no need of the others.
That a general rating such as is here proposed would have a beneficial effect few, I believe, are prepared to disprove, and any opposition to its adoption proceeding from the favoured quarters would be a manifest evidence in support of its advantages, not to mention the invidiousness of such opposition and the odium it would bring down on the opposers.
Bearing in mind, however, the generous and consideate feeling evinced by the wealthy portion of our metropolis for their less fortunate neighbours, I believe we should not find any material opposition to the plan from that quarter. fore probably should we have to contend with a few dreary old red-tapists, backed up by numerous petty parish statesmen and placemen, who would contend inch by inch for their little pateh of parish importance or pelf.
I am. Sir. your obedient anv,,4

SOUTHAMPTON, FEB. It.
The closing act of tho three months' drama has been enacted to-day, and the borough election of 1856-57 has become a matter of history. The official declaration of the poll was made this morning at the GUildhall by the Mayor and returnng officers. The hall was crowded with spectators, and as soon as the books were finaUy made up the Mayor declared the numbers to oe as follows:-
Mr. Weguelin .. 994 Sir Edward B2tler .. . .. 9i2 Mr. Andrews ... ... ... 726
He therefore declared the first-named gentleman duly elected as the representative of S3uthampton in the House of Commons.
Mr. HARFIELD, solicitor, on behalf of Sir Edwar.1 Butler, pretested against the return, on the ground that two of the paling-booths were destroyed at five minutes before 4 o'clock, qwhen some of Sir Edward's voters were waiting to poll.
Mr. POCOCE made a similar protest on the part of Mr. Andrews.
Mr. WEGUELDT, who met with a very cordial reception, briefly addressed the electors, thanking them for the high honour which they had conferred upon him.
Some of the electors having also spoken, the proceedings of this !long-protracted election were brought to a close by thecadoption of a vote of thanks to the Mayor and the returmnin of ficers
The bells rang merry peals, but there were no other demonstrations ofvctory.
HULL, WED'eESDAy.
This morning the election of a member of Parliament for this borough, consequent upon the elevation to the bench of Sir W. H. Watson, took place in front of the Town-hall, where at least 4,000 people were assembled. Mr. Clay was the only candidate, and was returned, but considerableinterest is manifested in the town as to whether the House of Commons will reject Mr. Clay as unqualified to sit in the present Parliament, on the ground that he was unseated for bribery and corruption in 1852. The caudidates in the iberal interest, who have issmed addresses to the electors, beleving that Mr. Clay would not sit in this Parliament, have been Mr. Edwin James, Q.C., and Mr. W. H. Schneider, merchant, of London, who, however, with. drew on Air. Clay having announced publicly that he had the highest legal authority for stating that the ground of his disqualification had ceased to exist when the Bribery Act of 1854 was passed. The Conservatives solicited Mr. J. Barkworth, timber merchant of Hull, to contest the borough, but that gentleman declned the honour, and the like reslt, we understand, attended similar invitations to Mr. A. Ban. nister, the late mayor of Hull, and Mr. A. Turer, brother of the chairman of the Liverpool Dock Committee.
The SEERIFF (hir. C. S. Todd) having gone through the usual preliminaes,
Mr. HENRY BLUN DELL proposed Mr. Clay as a fit and proper person to represent the borough.
Mr. B. J. THoarsoN seconded the nomination.
The SEnRvrFF, having called in vain on any person who might have another candidate to propose to comac forward, declared Mr. James Clay duly elected member for HnulL
Mfr. CLAY then came forward, and was received with loud and protracted cheers. He said,-Kings and Princes can give stars and titles,-the people alone can send a man to the House of Commons. It is true that you have not been caUed upon to exercise your right in the pollingbooth; this, indeed, is little like the elections which we have been used to see in HulL ("EHear, hear,"andlauehter.) Not only is there no third man, but there is not even a second man. ("Hear, hear," and laughter.) And if there has been no contest, it is because it is a well known fact to every one that the large majority of the constitnency of Hull were thorough-going orange (loud cheers), and that they had determined to continue their confidence in me (cheers); and yet, gentlemen, if I could have had my own way-which few of us can have-this should not have been a mere walk-over. (Loud cheers.) If I could have selected a candidate for those who are opposed to us in political principles, I would have selected for them, if possible, the very man that the country affords-a man whom I might have been proud to meet as an opponent. (Cheers.) I would have selected such a man for them in order that the world might have known that which Hall knows, that a large majority would have shown their disapprobation of the proceedings which unseated Lord Goderich and myself (loud and repeated cheering), and would have given the moist convincing evidence that, after all that has been said and done, they stil considered me worthy of their confidence and esteem. (Renewed and Prolonged cheers). That such would have been the result of a contest I entertain no doubt (loud cheers); not only are those electors who share our political principles in a large majority, but I know-and I speak it with honest pnride-I know that I should have had in this, a sngle-handed contest, considerable support from gentlemen who differ from me in political opinion, but who yet would have supported me, partly in the belief that I was somewhat hardly treated, partly in the consciousness that, although not agreeing with them in political opinion I have endeavoured conscientiously, and to the verylbest of my ability, irrespective of party, either Whig or Tory, to do my autywhenIhad the honour to represent your borough in the Commons House of Parhament. (Loud and repeatedeheering.) Iknow that Ishould have received much support in this way, and it would not have been the support which I should least have valued. (Cheers.) There were other gentlemen of that party, too, who have assured me that, although they could not conscientiouslyassist me, they undoubtedly on this occasion would not have done anything against me. (Cheers.) I don't know whether you recollect the story of the Yankee and the bear. It is a very short one. A Yankee forester finding himself face to face with a grizzly bear, and unaable to escape from the combat, prayed most fervently that he might De assisted against the bear; but he fivushed his prayer in a somewhat unusual way, saying that if it was not worth while to assist him, " whatever you do, don't help the bear.' (Iaughter and cheers.) Now, I speak it with pride, that there were many gentlemen opposed to mc on political rinciples who yet considered that I had so we one my duty as their member that they were prepared not to assist the bear. (Cheers and laughter.) I said when I commenced that the people alone could make a member of Parliament. I was not strictly right. I should have said that the people alone ought to be able to make a member of Parliament. (Loud cheers.) But do we forgetthat there are other boroughs not so favourably circumstanced as our own, where the real opinion of the people has no free expression, where the members sent to the House of Commons represent, not the interests, the wants, and the hopes of the people at large, but the paltry interests, or it may be, the bigoted prnciples of some great lord or powevrful family who has the borough in his pocket. (Cheers.) Have we forgotten this? Aw d have we forgotten how many thousands of our fello -men, as richly entitled by honesty and by intelligence as ourselves to exercise the franchise-how many o' those have not that right ? (HIear, hear.) We used to recollect these things well (cheers9, and if we have forgotten them we ought to be ashamed of ourselves. (HEIar, hear.) I am always told by my friends to avoid this subject of Parliamentary reform, because the people care little about it now, and all you do is to make a dull spech. I can't help it. (Cheers.) I will do that which I believe to be my duty (lou and protracted cheering), and I Will never lose an opportunity of keeping alive the tradition of the good old reformers, and reminding the people that their rights are yet to be won. (Cheers.) Nor can I too frequently repeat that which I said in the Corn-Exchange the other night. I cannot too frequently repeat that your rights are to be had for the asking. (Hear, hear.) But you must ask as if you meant it. ("Hear, hear," and cheers.) I do not defend the system which calls upon you for great exertions-for great sacrifices of time and of your personal interests in order to obtain your rights. That which is yours ought to be at your hand, so that you might grasp it without diffiuty. (Cheers.) It is not so, but still it is within your reach if you will only stretch out your haud far enough-if you wiU only exert yourselves. And again I tell you that when the people of England have made up their minds in carnest to demand those political rights about which not many years back they were so anxious-whenever, I say, they have made up their minds to demand those rights with a loud and united cry, there is no power in the kingdom which will dare toresisttheirdemand. (Enthusiastic cheers.) But there are other subjects besides Parliamentary reform, which are of equal, perhaps even of more pressing importance, and deserve equaUy, if not more, the attention of your members; and the very first, to my mind, of aU these subjects is that of economyand retrenchment. (Hear, hear.) We have been now for some two or three years past indulging in a most enormous expense for the purposes of war. The people of England went relactantly into that war; but, once in, they determined they would not go out of it unless with victory. (Hear, hear.) Bat this cost a great deal of money, and the expenditure of the country was raised by something like 40,000,0001. I am very much afraidthat, although we have returned to nce that enormous expenditure may leave behind it some habits of extravagance, and that we shal not be as careful as we ou ht to be of the public purse. (Hear, hear.) I, at least, win not bo blameable in that particular. I wil recoUect that it is of no use talking about the reduction of taxes unless you have reduced the expenditure of the country That which we spend must be paid (hear, hear) ; and if a tax is taken off in one direction it must be laid on in another. If they do not hit you high they will hit you low, and we do not like to be hit anywhere. (Cheers and laughter.) The matter of real importanee is the reduction
of txne expenditure, and we have an instanoe alraost within the last few hours of how much can be done in this way where there is a wiU to do it. When I spoke on MondLy in the Corn-Exchange I said I presumed that the Chau. ceUor of the Exchequer intended to relieve us from the additional 9d. of income-tax which was laid on for the purposes of the war. It appears that he had no intention of the kind. Some reduction he would have made,exactly what I do not know. He may have intended 4d.-he may even have intended 5d.-but he had no intention of making thewhole reduction ; and the estimates were so framed as to requlre a considerable amount of the tax beyond the 7d. we onginally paid. (Hear, hear.) Now, it occurred to some uneasy spirits in the House of Commons -it occurred to Mr. Disraeli-to give notice that he should make a motion for the reduction of that 9d.; it occurred to Mr. Gladstone, a man of great ability and great iniluence, to say that he should support Mr. Disraeli in that motion. It occurred to the whipper-irn to consult the gentlemen in the House of Commons, and to ask how many of them were under a pledge to their constituents, how many of them were under pressure from their constituants, and how many were likely to support that motion for economy and retrenchment. Now this is a subject upon which the people have spoken their minds, and whenever they speak their minds they will see it attended to. I have no doubt it was found tha, the pressure upon members of Parliament from their constituents for relief from this enormous tax was so great that it was impolitic ti resist it, and that Government would have been left in a minority. (Hear, hear.) What was done ? Did the Chancellor of the Exchequer stick to his estimates? Did the iMinister of War say he could not spare a six;pence of the money he had asked for ? Did the
First Lord of tho Admiralty say that it was wholly impOSsible to reduce the naval expenditure? No. They laid their heads together; and although the reduction in the esates cannot represent less than two or three millions,
it may be a great deal more, for, as I said, I do not kno;w how mnch the intendod reduction would have been ; it may bo that the actual reduction which tho Chancellor of the Exchequer may make on Friday next may bo three or foar milhons at least below what the first eatimates proposod. Now, although this was the case, they took their shears and their scissors, and clipped off a thousand here and a thousand there. The time was very short, becanse it iwas necessary-to be beforehand with their opponents, and in the conrse of a few days the necessary amount-which, mind you, would have come out of our pockets-the necessary amount wi be clipped off the estimates, and the eountry will be saved an extraordinary sum of money. (Choers.) NowS, this is only one instance of bow much may be done where there is a wiU to do it. (H-lear, hear.) A.nd I am convinced that the first duty of a member of the House of Commons now is closely to watch the expenditure of the public money, because I feel there will be every temptation to extravagance, and wo have been accustomed for some time past to shut our eyes to the enormons expenses which were necessary; but now we must open onr eyes to the smalest charge which is unnecessary and which maybe dispensed with. (Cheers.) Now, I may bo asked by some of you whether I intend to support the present Administration. XaturaUy my inclination is to support a Libe al Government. Not that any of them go far enough fror me; but stiU my disposition is to support that Government -a Liberal Government-which cornes nearest tomv way of thinking. Ba I have seen too much of public hche and of pubUo men to Iledge myself to the support of any man or of any set of men. S Hear, hear.) The only pledge which I w make to yon Is to support, not men, but measures. .And, from whatever quarter good meassres may proceedwhether from Lord Palmerston, whether from Lord John Russell, whether from Lord Derby-from whatever quarter good measures proceed, I wiU support those only which appear to me calculated to support the two great principles of economy and reform (cheers)-calcnlated to add to the happinesi of the country to the social and moral improvement of the people, and to the welfare of the working classes. .(Loud cheers.) This is my creed; and by a steadfast adhesion to it I hope to merit the suffrages which today you have given me; and I hope to be able on a future occasion, with no downcast eyes and with no faltering voice, to be able again to ask for a repetition of your confidence. (Loud cheers.) It now remains for me, gentlemen, only to thank you for the honour you have conferred upon me and it is, indeed, impossible for me to find terms adequately to represent my feelings. You have this d.y conferred upon me, for the third time, an honour without a price-the honour of reprosentin- a free, a numerous, and an inteUigent constituency in the House of Commons. I can only say that from my heart I thank you; and that to the best of my ability! such as it maybe, and with unUiring zeal and honesty, whch all men can command, I will endeavour to
deserve your confidence. (Loud cheers, in the mnidst of which Mtr. Clay stood down.)
A vote of thanks to the Sheriff concluded the proceedings, which passed off with the greatest quietness.

Charles Attwood And The Rev. George Hemming.
CHARLES ATT WOOD AND TE BEV. GEORGE I ~~~HEMMING.
-- -v- - 0- .'
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-As it might seem from a statement in Mr. Hemming's letter, in yesterday's Times, that Attwood's petition was promoted by Kr. Palmer, of Nazeing, I beg to state that he had no hand in it. On the complaint being made to him he referred Charles Attwood to me for advice, and he has not since interfered in the matter. The case appeared to me, on inquiry, to be one of great hardship, worse than that of the brothers Collin, who were committedby the same magistrate, and whose highly creditable forbearanceo to prosecate when they had an opportunity was ill-rewarded by a shameful attack upon their characters, though I do not charge Mr. Hemming with that. In the present case, finding that Attwood had no remedy by action, I advised him that the only course open to him was to petition Parliament to amend tho law, which course, more for the sake of other labouring men than himself, he decided to adopt. The petition recently presented was accordingly prepared by me, by his desire. The allegations in it were chiefly grounded on his statements as to facts presumably within his knowledge, and the whole was carefully read over to him, with explanation (where any was needed) before he affixed his mark and declared it to be his petition; after which (and finding that Mr. Hemming urged nothing to justify me in Stopping it) it was placed in Mr. Roundell Palmer's hands for presentation. I cannot believe that Attwood wiU disclaim his deliberate act.
In regard to Mr. Hemming's statement of Attwood's case, it differs materiaUy in some respects from Attwood's statements to me; bht, though I do not impeach the veracity of the magistrate, or pretend to place testimony necessarily uamworn generally on a par with depositions on oath, I think-that an honest mant is entitled to credit although un. sworn; and stiU retaining great confidence in the truth. fulness and general accuracy of Attwood I attributo the discrepancy to some misunderstanding, failure of memory, want of explanation, or mistake of the facts. I gathered from his statement that he was a day labourer at 2s. per day, paid weekly on Fridays, when on Friday, the 1st of August, after he had received 12s. wages as usual, he had some words with his master rospecting his wages for the coming harvest nmonth (Attwood saying he must have four gaineas, when the master thought he hai agreed for 41.), and respecting his taking the place of the horsekeeper, who was then discharged, which he hesitated to do, as having the appearance of taking another man's work away. The question of wages appears to havo been then postponed by Mr. Beane to the morrow; but on the further objections being started he is stated to have intimated that Attwood, if not satisfied, might leave; whereupon the same evening Attwood went and obtained work from his old master from the Tuesday following, thinking he should work out the common labonring week with Mfr. Beane on the Saturday, and desiringa holyday on Monday to see the review. Thus, when he came the next morning (Saturday), thinldng to oblige Mr. Beane by looking after the horses, he told the foreman when he came and M1r. Beane, when he had an opportunity of speaking to hin in the evening, that he came only for that day, and did not intend to come any more.
It is clear that Attwood, having engaged to work for Mr. Ricketts as beforementioned, had no idea that when he came to Air. Beane on the Saturday he was beginning another week, and he denies that he had agreed for the harvest month at 11. per week, or commenced the harvest month on that Saturday, as alleged by Mr. Hemming.
I am stronglyinclined to believe that Attwood speaks the truth, and that the foreman may have been mistaken, and that there has been a failure of memory in others. If he had commenced under such new contract, as stated by Mr. Hemming, he was bound to serve for the whole month; and would Mr. Beane or Mr. Hemming have been ready to release him for three weeks out of the fonr! Again,-the warrant of commitment says nothing of any such agreement; but, stating the alleged contract of service " for the term of from week to week at 12s. per week," and Attwood had been found guilty in absenting himself " before the term of his said contract was completed," it thereupon orders that he should be committed to the House of Correction for 21 days, with hard labour, and that " the sum of 36s. should be abated from the wages of the said C. Attwood the same being a proportionable part of his wages for and during the said term he should be so confined." How does this accord with the statement that he had commenced the harvest month at 1. per month, in which case 31. would have been the proportion of his wages to be deducted ? Is it possible that any deposition concerning the agreement for the harvest month has been taken since Attwood was committed? I ask the question in the interests of justice, and for the crodit of Mr. Hemming himself, remembering what was said respecting a warrant in the case of the brothers Collin.
I grieve, Sir, for the necessity of troubling yon with so mulch detail, but I must add that Attwood emphatically denies tke use of the oath attributed to him when Mir. Beane advised him to go back and finish the week ; or that he was ever at liberty after the commitment had been signed (so far as his knowledge extends) to have obtained his release by going back to work for Mr. Beane ; that MIr. Hemming previously pressed him to do so, under threat of imprisonment, is not denied; but it must be remeinibered that the old man lad a strong sense of his right; and he never thought, as he told me, that Mr. Hemming, who, he said, was very cross and short with him, would have gone so far as to send him to prison.
In regard to his son, Mr. Hemmines statement does not materially differ from the petitioner's, which may have been mistaken in some little matters of detail, as in the particular expression attributed to Mr. Hemming. Mr. Hommilng will find upon inquiry that before Thomas Attwood went to Londonon the Sundayhe had arranged with another to look after the horses that evening; and that but for his missing the last train on that Sunday night ho would have been back to look after them again himself (as he expected to have been) on the Monday morning. He wilL also find, I believe, that, though perhaps unable then to work, he went over to see Mxr. 1emmmn,r on the Monday afternoon, after he had gone out; andohe may recollect that on the Tuesday morniog, when summarily dismissing him, without hearing his eap anation, he threatened him not only with the warrant, but to send him where he had sent his father. It is not strange that the poor lad, dismissed unheard, and fearing to be " prisoned," left his home to swell the over-stocked labour-market of London. Can any instance more clearly show the impolicy of the law which may be so apphed ?
Yet one word more. When the father last Sunday asked Mr. Hemming to forgive his son ir. Hemmingseems to have told him that if he had thought of that g re presenting such a petition " Tom might have been back at his work aong ago. " Now, if he was so ready to forgive the son if it had not been for the father's petition, why did he turn a deaf ear to the mother last December, before the petition had been either presented or prepared? It was from her pe, after she had met with a rebuff, that I first heard of her son's case, and of the father's cottage having been entered at night by polcemen armed with the warrant for his apprehension.
But I grieve to have had anything to say concerning Mr. Hemming. The amendment of the law, which is much in fault, and protection for the future, is all that the petitioner desires; and we must not be severe, nor bear enmnity against others whnom we may think over severe.
I am, Sir, your obedient aervant

ACCIENT TO TEm BnLGwu GovERN mENT MAIL STMUMIT.-The Belgian Government mail steamer Diamnant, that left Dover with the mails on Friday, at 1I pm., ran ashore to the eastward of Ostand on Saturday morning. She was got off in the couse of two hours, and reahed Ostend at 8 am.

The Frauds On The City Banks.
THE FRAUDS ON THE CITY BANKS.
James Anderson and JamieTowUsend Saward, wholave been repeatedly examined upon charges of extensive for. gery upon many of the firt banking houses in the city, were brought beforo the LORD MAYOR for final exaumnation,
Mr. Mullens, Solicitor to the Committee of Bankers for Protection from Forgeries and Frauds, again attended for the prosecution. Mr. Giffard appeared for Saward; Anderson was not represented by a legal adviser.
Mr. Goodman, the chief clerk, proceeded to read tho voluminous depositions of nearly 60 witnesses, which con. sumed nearly the whole of the day, at the conclusion of which Atwell, one of the approvers, and who has recently been sentenced to transportation for life upon a charge oL forgery, was called into the witness-box, and upon cross. cxamination by M1r. Giffard said,-Previous to my present sentence of transportation for life I was in business ia Booth-street, Spitalfields. That was about three years agJ, I never forged in my life. I was in tho " public line," ha Booth-street; that is, I was a licensed victualler.
Mr. Giffard.-In your examination in chief you use the word"business." To what business did you allude e Witness.-To forge and get money. Saward was to forge; he was a professor of forgery. The word " business"' meant
fr. Giffard.-When did you first begin the business ot forging ?-I never began it all, not my own self.
Mr. Giffard.-You mean that you never traced the forged instrument with your own pen .-No.
tnr. Giffard.-You are now under sentence of transporta4 tion for life, aro you not9 1Yes.
Mr. Giffard. --Wivere you innocent or guilty of the crime laidlto your charge ?
Witness.-I was innocent of the charge brought againt me. I was charged with forging and uttering.
Mr. Giffard.-You were not guilty of either charge? Witness.-I was guilty as being an aceessory.
Mr. Giffard.-Do you remermber Markham bein
Witness.-Yes. Makam AdiMed
Mr. Giffard.-You knew that he was innocent, did yout not ?-Yes I did. (Sensation.)
Mr. Giffard.-Was ho tried with a brother of younrs ? Witness.-Yes he was.
Mtr. Giffard.-You knew that your brother -was guilty ? Witness.-Yes, I knew my brother was guilty.
M3r. Giffard.-When did you take to dishonesty as a mneans of livelihood?
Witness.-I don't know that I have taken to that at al.
Mr. Giffard.-Were you ever committed upon any other charge than the one for which you are now undergoing t sentence of transportation for life ?
Witness. -Yes, that was about three years back; since I camn out of business.
Mr. Giffard.-Was thatthe first criminal offence of which you had been guilty?
Witness.-Oh, I don't know about that. It was the first time I was found out. " No catchy, no havy." (Laughter.)
Examination continued.-Iwas for a time m the fur trade. I first met Hardwicke in Farringdon-market about seven or eight months back. I did not know that Hard. wicke was going to make disclosures to the Bank authoritie3 till I was spoken to upon the subject by Mr. Mullens. T went by the name of Hawkes when I was a publican. I have known Hardwicke pass by the name of Ralph in th3 country. In London he passed as Thomas Hardwicke, and also as Thomas Salt Hardwicke.
Re-examined by Mr. Mullens.-I went by the name oE Attwood at Yarmouth. When I employed Mr. Turner, the solicitor, I used the name of Hunter. Mir. Lewis was my attorney at my trial, and I first communicated to hirn the transactions of which I have given evideuce. You (Mr. MIullens) and Mr. Lewis afterwards caUed to see me. I never had anything to do with forged checks before I became acquainted with Saward.
William Salt Hardwicke, who was convicted with Atwell; and who is also under sentence of transportation for life, was then called into the box and cross-examined.
M[r. Giffard.-Is William Salt Hardwicke the only name
name.
Mr. Giffard.-Did you ever go by the name of Parish? Witness.-dever.
Mx. Giffard.-Is this the first time that you have turneti Quieen's evidence?
Witness.-Yes. I never transported a man nor was tio cause of his being transported; but if you look at this list you wil find the names of 11 men who have been transported by your client, Mr. Saward.
The witness handed a paper to the learned counsel of which the following is a copy:-
"James, Alien. life; John Donglas, 50 years: HTenry Bradbnry, 21 yesrs; Thomnas Ford, 1 year- WVilliam WVilkIneon), 10 years;- N~ash 10
yeas:Agar. le:. uilliasa kardwicke, life; Henrty AtWeli, life; J Ander. for trial; aRrkham. 4 years (tbe lat man innocent).
Mr. Giffard. -Do you know Mr. Thomas Cooper? Witness-I do not.
(MIr. Cooper was a witness who described himself as a l e tired tradesman with no settlo4 place of abode, and who said he was at the King's Arms publichouse, in Bishopsgate. clurchy'ard, on a certain day in June last, when he saw Hardwncke there; and he added that he had known Sawa?t(
years ago as a "man about town." When Mr. Cooper was called to-day he did not answer.]
Mr. Giffard.-Did not Mr. Cooper converse with yom npon the subject of what you had for dinner on the day wZen he said he saw you?
Witness.-I recollect a man being brought to me in an ad'oining room for the purpose of identifying me, but I
not know his name. le did teUl me what I had fon dinner at the King's Arms, and I told him it was aU right. He had a black eye, and appeared to me when he was here to be in a state of intoxication. He certainly must have been drinking; he was talking very wild.
Mr. Giffaro.-You say that you never went by the namo of Parish.-No; I should consider that too beggarly a name to go by. (.aughter.)
Mr. Giffard.-Now, tell me the names by which yon havo gone.-I have already answered that question.
Mr. Giffard.-Answer it again.-Witiam Salt Eardwickeo Mr. Giffard.-Any other I do not recoUect it.
Mr. Giffard.-Will you swear that ?
Witness.-I now recollcot that I have passed in the name of Jenkins. I saved a girl's life at Hulf, and on that occa. sion gave tho name of Jenkins. The girl feU into the Humber, and I saved her from drowning.
M,r. Giffard.-Now, was it as Jenkins or as Rardwicke that you were under a charge of burglary at Bre-. con ?-No, it was Salt.
Mr. Giffard.-In what name were you transported at Plymouth ?
Witness.-William Salt, aZias Hardwicke. When I was ordered to be transported and made my escape from Brecon Gaol, Saward was perfectly alvare that I was innocent, although I suffered for it.
Saward.-I didn't know you at that time.
Witness.-Yes you did. I had nothing to do with the bnrglary which I was charged with having committed. The stolen property was found on my premises. I went downa thereby Saward's advice.
Mr. Giffard.-Then, of that offence of which you were found guilty you were innocent ?
Witness.-I went down by the advice of Saward antl a man named Alexander Fraser, to see that a person named Walter White had proper professional assistance to defend him Upon a charge bf burglary. White was tried and acquitted. On our road home he stopped at a tree, from a hole in which he took the produce of the burglary which he had been tried for. The property consisted of watches and silver plate. He wished to borrow 101. of me upon the produce of the burglary, but I declined to let him have it. 0 begged hard of me to show him somez place in which he could deposit the property. He said he did not like to take it to a strange place, and after some persuasion I alowed him to put it into an iron safe in a warehouse of which I held possession. On the foUowing morning, upon his attempting to dispose of a portion of it, he was foUowed to my warehouse, where the remainder of it was found. I was thereupon taken into custody and placed in Brecon Gaol, from which I escaped.
Mir. Giffard,-Were you innocent of the ch3rge upon which you were apprebended at Plymouxtl, and for which you were transported?
Witness.-I was. I was not in England when the offence was committed for which I was sent abroad.
Mr. Giffard.-Did you not go to Saward in 1S44 and ask him a question about the title to some land tlist you had in 2u.stra ?-I did, and he drew out a ease for the opinion of counsel.
Cross-examination continued.-It was always part of my scheme to represent min lf as a respectable anau. I did represent myself as a colonial trader, and I was one. I had land in Australia. Mr. Barge was the couns,l whose opinion. was obtained by Saward. That was not the first occasion upoa which Saward ard I had met. I was not in England. when Markham was tried. When I heard that he had been innocentlyconvicted, Anderson, Saward,Atwell, aman named Thomas Smith, and myself, met and subscribed a sovereirn each for his wife. The 51. was given to Atwell to leave or her at a publichouse, the landlord of which has since told me tt h gave her the money. I reasoned with Anderson for not trying to get Markhamn acquitted, upon which Saw-ard said that "that wouldn't do, as he (Anderson) ndght drawhimself into it." (Sensation.) I knaew Edward Agar (the aPprover in the late bullion robbery came) thirough S'iward, with whom I first became acquainted about 2:3 or 26 years ago._He was always. known as "J'em, the penm-n" iT
am, out iaward was known for years after I first becameo acquaintedl with bina to be carrying skeleton keys through the city for a gang of burglars when they wanted them for a night I cannot say that I corrnpted Sawardl. (Laughter.) IL was in England when Agar was tried. Saward told )me that he was in the `habit ofsellirwa gold for Agar.
Ro-examined by Mr. Mullens.-I arrived in England on the 26th of May, 1856. From 1553 or 1854 to that time I was in the colonies. Sawardia k-nown mne several yeara previous to my being confined in Brecon Gaol. Saward introduced me to Agar, to whom I sold a craps shawl which I had brought with me from the colonies. Saward told me I might trust Agar for the amount of the shawl, and I did so. In 1844 I met Alexander Frazer at Saward's. cbambers, 4, Hare-court, Temple.
This closed the evidence for the prosecutiou
The LORD MAYOR, after giving the pridlers tho usual caution, asked them whether they had anything to say ur answer to the charec? Andeson.-No
Saward.-I am not guilty of the charge.
The prisoners were then fully committed for trial.

fONBY4ABTanCITYINTELLaENCOB
hv E ''Wednesday Evening.
'he Engliah funds have shown more animation
to-day than for a long time past, and have closed at an improvement of three-eighths per cent. Consols for money, which left off yesterday at 93 to i, were first quoted 93s to J, and a tendencv to firmness, which was soon manifested, having ultimately been increased by a very positive report that the dispute with Persia had been adjusted, an advance took place to 93i to i, which was maintained to the termination of business. For the 5th of MIarch the last price was 93 to 7.

In the Stock-Exchange to-day there was less deniand for money, but the rate for advances on Goveinment securities was still as high as 6 per cent. In the discount-market and at the Bank of England there was a considerable diminution of pressure.
Foreign securities opened with firmness, and subsequent purchases caused a slight advance. In Turkish Six per Cents. transactions took place for money at 94, 93i, and 94j; and in the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, at 10E. The general operations comprised-Brazilian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., New, 379; the Five per Cents., New, 1843, 100X; Mexican Three per Cents, for money, 211 and i; Peruvian Four-and-a-f[alf per Cents., 782; Portuguese Three per Cents., 441 and -; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 96 ; Sardinian Five per Cents., 90 ; Spanish Three per Cents., 40; the Certificates of Coupon not funded, 6; and ; Au.ckian Five per Cents., 84; Belgian Four-and-aflalf per Cents., 99k; Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents3, G51 and 64:; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 982.
The corn-market this morning was without recovery.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 68f. I0c. for money, and 68f. 35c. for the end of the month, showing no alteration except a slight increase of dulness.
A further sum of 96,0001. of Australian gold was sold to the Bank to-day, making, with the amount -taken there yesterday, a total of 156,0001. out of the recent arrival of 822,0001.
The bar silver brought by the last Mexican steamer was sold to-day at 61 d. per ounce, being dd. per ounce decline from the price realized for that by the previous packet.
Some of the opponents of the Bank Charter Act seem disposed to prepare for the non-adoption of their views by alleging that the labours of the intended committee will be neutralized by the Government havino arrived at a foregone conclusion. It is essential that this impression should at once be checked. The committee will afford means for every doctrine in connexion with the subject to be clearly put forth, and, if those who demand a change of system fail now to establish their propositions, they must be prepared for the future to acquiesce in the settlemnenit that may be arrived at. The Government, in granting a committee, while they were satisfied that n-o material change is required, could have had no other motive than that of giving to all the theorists who have appealed to the public during the past 10 years a full opportunity of explaining themselves, and of thus placing upon indelible record the substantiation or failure of their respective creeds. If any of the witnesses make out a clear ease against the act, they may rely that neither the prejudices of the Government, nor the efforts of a committee, however it may be constituted, can prevent the triumph of their doctrine. The question is one above all others capable of exact demonstration. Imagination can exercise no inI;uence upon it, and it is also wholly independent of the bias of parties or the selfishness of established interests. If any one can prove to the country that there is a method of permanently placing a greater amount of money at its command than it has ever before enjoyed or hoped for, or that commercial vicissitudes may be prevented, or that over-speculation, and the disasters that have hitherto attended it, may be rendered impossible, he wil confer a benefit on all alike, and his discovery will be universally welcomed. He may be sure, likewise that it will spread over the world and be eagerly seizedl by every civilized nation that has ever found itself in want of means. With this encouragement there will be no excuse for any one to hold back on the plea that it is useless to contend against official pre-arrangements. Let it be understood, therefore, that niow is the time to speak, and that -this opportmnity is final. It would be intolerable, after a Parlianmentary settlement shaU have again been effected for 10 years, for the public to be deluged at every crisis that may happen during that interval with fresh letters, pamphlets, and speeches, to show that instead of being consequent upon their own want of prudence all these events are to be attributed to the neglect of some principle that might easily have been introduced for insuring at all times a " sufficient" supply of the circulating medium.
The following table, partly compiled from a Parliamentary paper issued this morning, shows the estimate for the Post-office packet service for the current year as compared with that for 1856. The total presents an increase of 208,6771., consequent upon two new contracts-namely, from Dartmouth to the Cape of Good Hope, Mauritius and Calcutta, and from Southanmpton to Australia vic Ceylon:-
Advices from Konigsburg give unfavourable accounts regarding the cattle disease, which during the past two years has manifested itself in Polana and other pats of Russia, and which now threatens to spread to Germany. For a short timne during last autumn there seemed to be some abatement in the distemper, but it has again become very virulent. It seizes the annuals suddenly, and after aevere trembling and purging they die within fourand-twenty hours. One proprietor lately lost 300 head in a single night. It attacks cattle exclusively, and does not communicate itself to sheep or any other kind of stock. Every effort is used to prevent infection, and detachments of the military are charged to destroy and bury all that become affected. On the Prussian frontier a strict quarantine is enforced; but it has already made its appearance in some villages, and the authorities have ordered that if even onJy one of a herd be attacked the whole are to be slaughtered. The recent progress of the disease northward toward St. Petersburg has been a chief cause lately in the advance of the tallowmarket.
The following relates Vo a proposed bill for giving ,egect in England to decreeta or judgments obtained in Scotwd:-
Sir, -ls.eg to draw your attention to the possible abuse which may arise if Mr. Crauf-d's bil, for giving effect in England to decreets or judgments obtained in Scotland, is passed without a provision being made to render such a contingency impossible and out of the power of any party.
"To render the as intligible to English readea it is necessary to explain that by the law of Scotland, w en a suit or action at law is raised, tho plaintiff need not aerve a copy of the writ or sumnons enpon the defender personaly the same being left st the usu known residence or ' domi. cU of the latter iR all that is done to entitle the plaintiff to come into court and obtain final judgment. By the law QC ,vtlAd au extraordinary figftion prevsl tbat a mm
held to retain his 'domicile' for 40 days after he has actualy left it, and it follows as a matter of course and daily practice, that judgments are obtained gainst absent parties before they bave an opportunity of seeing the writ or lodging any defence to the suit.
rThe same thing would occur were the decreet on a bi'l of exchange, and the party can be irnprisoned in Scotland six days after notice has been left at the last known I domicile.' if the ainounit is not paid within that period.
'- The provision against giving decreets or judgments in alIsence the same force in England as those obtained in Scotland after defences are heard ought to be carefully framed, otherwise parties may be unexpectedly and unjustly ca'led upon in England or Ireland to pay debts sued for in b;cotland, which they never contracted, or for which they are not liable.
"I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
'With respect to the dock-warrant question and the ease of " Kingsford v. Merry," the Vice-President of the Board of Trade stated last night that, before the Government would interfere to amend the law, steps must be taken to satisfy them that the mercantile community desire an alteration, a point on which, at present, it does not feel-assured, some mercantile persons having objected to any change, and the chairlnan of the recent city meeting on the subject being opposed to the objects for which that meeting was convened. These remarks seem to indicate some misapprehension. Baron Rothschild was chairman of the meeting in question, and has. from the first expressed himself strongly on the urgent necessity for a legislative remedy of the evil complained of. As regards other influential members of the commercial body, it can only be said that the meeting was one of the largest and most influential ever held on such a subject. Opinion has hitherto seemed to be unanimous, except on the part of some of the city solicitors, who appear to consider that the state of things developed by the conflicting decisions of the two Courts in the late trial may be suffered to continue without involving either danger or disgrace. Even these gentlemen, however, have thus far refrained -from publishing their views and submitting them to the test of general criticism.
At a meeting of the Port Phillip Gold Mining Company, held to-day, MIr. J. D. Powles in the chair, the report (of which an abstract was published on Monday) was received. A strong discussioa took place on the management of the undertaking, which has thus far been unsuccessful. An attempt is now being made to carry out quartz-crushing at Ballarat, and as the machinery by the latest advices is in operation the result of working will be shortly ascertained. At the close of the proceedings the re-election of one of the auditors was opposed, and another shareholder was nominated as a candidate, After a further debate it was determined to resort to a ballot, the result being as follows ;-For the amendment, 108 votes, representing 2,090 shares; for the original motion, 972 votes, representing 19,300 shares.
A notice by the East India Company for tenders for vessels to convey 2,400 troops to Madras was issued a few days since; and it was arranged that the decision should have been given this afternoon. Shortly before the hour fixed a further notice was issued, stating that the taking up of vessels for the purpose mentioned is for the present postponed. Trhis decision is presumed to be in consequence of the reported arrangement of the Persian question.

The arrivals of all descriptions of grain aro moderate; but tho. ot A.merican flour continue large. The operations, however, are 31mited without much variation in any description. Wheat ebows nO great change. Barley and oats are quiet, at prevlous quotations.
HVLI, FEB. 10.
The weather has changed, the fro8t having entirely disapreared. Th, winter, so far, has been unfavourable to the condition of grain. A few days' frost, succeeded by damp, murky weather, has been very de. trimental to grain, which has generally comc to hand in bad order,
Imports continue trifling. The present valne of aU desmiption of grain in this country affords but little inducement to foreign shippers to consign, and importers appear very cautious in operating for spring delivery at the rates asked. The arivals for some time to comoe ar
likely to be moderate, and the effect of spring shipments on tho trade appears to have been already fuly discounted.
"The wheat trade" (saye Money and Con's circular)` has lost that improved toue with which the last week closed, and the disposition to purchase has again subsided. Prices can scarcely be quoted lower, as theimportis insignificant, andbholdersofparels iD granary rono.

Reformatory And Refuge Union.
REFORAt TORY AND REFUGE UNION.
Yesterday afternoon the first annual general meetin of this society was held, under the presidency of the Ear¶ of Shattesbury, at Willis's-rooms, St. Jaes's. The large room was completely crowded by ladies and gentlemen and on the platform, arnong others, were the Earl of Chichester, the EaTl of Dacie, the Hon. Arthur Kinnaird, Lord Charles Russell, Lord Henry Cholmondeley, the Hon. and Rev. J. Pelham, Sir Stafford Northootc, ALP., Mr. T. Chambers, 1M.P., Mr. Russell Gurney, the Recorder of London, the Rev. W. W. Robinson, the Rev. Joseph Browen, the Pev. W. Tyler, the .Rev. E. Auriol, the Rev. Mr. Knight, the Rev. Mr. Tate, the Rev. Dr. Courtenay, r. Hs. Townall, Mr. x. Hanbury, Mr. Joseph Payne, MIr. J. MIaxwell, rc.
The Hon. and Rev. J. PELISAR having opened the proceedings with prayer,
The Earl of SRAFrE5DBuRY said, in most cass it was unnecessary for the chairman to tuake any greater demand on their attention than to request them to listen to the reading of the report, but the present subject was one of such peculiar novelty that it was on all accounts desirable to submit it then to public discussion. The reformatory principle was one which was regarded on all hands as necessary in the highest degree. There might be some difference of opinion as to the mude of management to be adopted, but there could be none as to the paramount importance of such institutions, or as to the benefits which they conferred. But, as there was that amount of difference as to the details of management, it was) considered advisble that there should be two distinct societies, though both were to work together in the most amicable manner; for the desire of both was only to see in whet way they could accord the greatest assistance to each other for the general furtherance of their joint and blessed undertaking. It was, in fact, a necessary consequence of the state of society in which we now lived that there should be reformatories, in order that young criminals might by timely reform.ation be saved to become an assistance and support to the institutions of the empire under which they were born. There must be reformatories as well as industrial schools. It was impossible to combine hoth these branches of the same reformatory institution under the one roof, and to teach both at the same school, for innocent children could not be aubjected to the taint which necessarily and, perhaps, rightly attached to aU children who broke the laws of their country. It was necessary that there should be a separation between the classes and therefore it was that this reformatory and refuge union had been established, and appealed now to public sympathy and suppor'. Prom the first annual report which was before the meeting they would see two plans by which they hoped they could render the greatest service to the cause of reformatories all over the kingdom, and also that it was proposed to ostablish a ship reformatory in the river Thames,-a plan which was singularly adapted to the wants of this metropolis, ini which such cbildren as came to reformatories invariably gave a preference to the sea-faring life. The society also proposed to discharge a great local duty wlhich none of the local reformatories would take on themselves-viz., to superintend all the arrangements necessary for the emigration of the children. From his own lonp experience he knew that these local institutions had neither the knowledgenortimeto undertake that duty for themselves, and the societywould also undertake the duty of preparing fitting guardians and receptacles at the other side o the water, wherethechildrenwould botaken care of until they were properly disposed of. While speaking of the general benefits of these means of prevention, he could not refrain from reading to the meeting a letter he had received from Mr. Thompson, of Banchory-house, Aberdeen. That gentleman said:-
" During the last year nine female children under 12 yeara of age, were committed to the prison of the county or Aberdeeu. Out of the
only one was to Aberdeeu prison, two to Peterhead and six to Francer brgh In other words, AberdeeD, with nearly SU,9 inhabitants aud four industrial schools, produced only one female criminal under 12: Peterhead. witb 10,0C0 inhabitants and no industrial schools, produced two; and Frazerburgh, with 4,500 Inhablitant aud no industrial welools, produced esix."
Some extrac's from another letter he (the Earl of Shaftesbury) believed would also be most welcome to the meeting. The noble Earl then proceeded to read a letter which he said he had received a short time ago from a young criminal in West Canada, who went out there from a reformatory with five others, and who stated that he had got a very good situation at Toronto, and knew 14 other lads, also from the reformatory, all of whom vere filling responsible posts. In short, out of 20 sent out, only two had relapsed into crime. With the exception of these two the writer spoke of them aU as doing well and attending church regularly, and concluded by expressing a hope that the reformatory was still flourishin-, and vigorous, and that he might be permitted to send a small subscription to its aid. (Hear, hear.) But, continued the noble chairman, a reformatory schemne to be complete must also include some plan for the adult criminal. It was undoubtedly a more difficult task to reform him than that of correcting the children, but it was also, in its way, a most necessary one. That, he thought, was not the place to discuss the ticket-of-leave question, but at least he niight impress upon them that there were vast numbers of ticket-ofleave men who had only undergone sentences of short periods, and who, unless some help was given to them, would soon be found among the ranks of deep and hardened criminals. (IRear.) He believed many of the ticket-of-leave men were anxious to work if they c.uld obtain it; and he believed, on the otherhand, there were many who would not take any work -no matter how rensmnerative-that might be offered them. There were some in whom vice was a confirmed habit and a second nature, and who would not quit their evil courses even if it was made more profitableto them so to do. (Hear.) There were many important difficulties which beset anud always would beset the ticket-of-leave class. In the first place, in the crowded state of the labour-market, untainted men would always be preferred to tainted. In other instances the employer took advantage of his knowledge of the ticket-of-leave man's situation to extract from him the mna.ximucm of labour for the mininstsm of pay. This acted naturally as a great discouragement to other ticket-of-leave men,and many would neither seeknor take employment. But unless this ticket-of-leave question was early taken in hand it would, ere long, become impossible for any authority, howeverpowerful, to grapple with it properly. The consideration of all these facts drove them back to the consideration of the preventive system, which, combined with reformatories, he believed, would all but be able, under God's bles3ing,to overcome a great part of the mischief which now threatened them. They must not think, however, that any one scheme was a specific. 0pinions and modes of all kinds must be harmonized, and al Jclaes brought together into active co-operation before that end could be obtained; and he had no doubt, if they persevered in that course, that that measure of success which they could look for under Provi. dence would sooner or later be within their reach. (Cbeers.)
The Secretary then read letters of as%ology and regret at not being able to attend from the Bis op of London, the Marquis of Westuiinster, Mr.Dunlop, LP.,Mr.Baxter M.P., and Dr. Guthrie. He next read the annual report, which, after dwelling upon the great success which had attended the efforts of the society at the outset, went on to state that, with a view of obtaining that information as to details which was of so much assistance in reformatories, they had offered prizes for the best essays on their practical management to the masters and matrons of such institutions, and they had also taken steps for supplying welltrained superiors "of tact, discretion, ability, anD good temper." The report then entered into details as regarded the plans for the reception of emnigrants, for social meetings, lectures, interchange of inmates, and other topics of a similar nature, including the correspondence system and plans for the grants of libraries. The receipts to the general fund amounted to 1,0Sll. 5s. 6d., of which sum there was a balance in hand of 3171. 15s. 2d. The nietropolitan fund receipts amounted to 2,2991. 4s. 6d., and had also exceeded the expenditure by 4251., which remained as a balance.

The hon. baronet said that, after the observations which had faUen from his Lordship, it would be unnecessary for him to do more than add a few words in support of the resolution, which he was glad to see all parties recognized as containing principles which it was their duty, as Christians ard Englishmen, to support. The movement in behalf of the plan had now passed the stage when individuals devoted themselves to it unnoticed and unthought of by the public. They had passed that stage, and the country was now inoculated with the subject, and almost prepared to accomplish the great work which this society advocated. The value of this Reformatory Union could not ba overrated, as he was prepared to prove from his own expenence of that small reformatory with which he had tho honour of being coanected in Devonshire. The subject of the reformatoriesthemselves could not be assisted by a'speech at a meeting, or even by giving money towards them ; it was only, first, by the discipline of its own schools, and, secondly, by its way of placing out the children afterwards. The first-named object would be vastly assisted by the new plan of interchange with inmates of other reformatories, so as to break up the smaU local bands of juvenile criminals, and prevent them being all kept, as had sometimes been the case, in the reformatory of the locality in which their offences had been committed. With regard to placing out the chldren well, he knew that the managers of local institutions found the greatest difficulty in that respect; and here the services of this society wold bo of unappreciable advantage. In order to "reclaim the depraved," as the resolution expressed it, they had a great work thrown on their hands, for the classes from which the ranks of Juvenile
cmasvere reerfited seemed al most mnoxhaustible. But the way to grapplo with that subject was to enforce the parent's responsibility for the part maintenance of his child while in the reformatory. (Eear, hear.) In two great towns of this country-Newcastle and Liverpool-he was infermed on the best authority that sinee thisparental responsibility had been stricty enforced the number of neglected children running about the streets of those towns had decreased to one-half. (wear hear.) That was quite a sufficient answer to those people who professed in the consideration of this sub.ect, to see nothing but insuperable difficulties on every side. He begged to move that the resolution he had read be adopted.
MIr. T. CsLUs Rns, ALP., seconded the resolution. The question of reformatories kad net been taken up until the whole subject called peremptorily for interference, and until all men felt that some steps other than those of police and coercion. were necessary, if they were to bo xaved from a great and continualy increasing eviL Even yet the public were not agreed as to a ganeral scheme, and he, for one, thought that many plans would have to be tried before a perfect one well adapted to t'aeir exigencies was found. They must, however, be careful that the reformatory system did not itself become a kind of temptation with the wretched to disbonesty; they nrust not do too much, and incur the charge of placing honesty at a disadvantage. (Hear, hear.) A good practical scheme might be arrived at by the Legislatwro, which would be also philanthropic, by saving the public from incorrigible and desperate criminals, and, on the other hand, save tens of thousands of juvenile offenders from lapsing into the lowrestdepths of crime. (Hear, bear.)
The resolution wvas then put, nnd carried siens disg M[r. RDUSSELL GSIINF:Y then proposed,-

After briefly alluding to the great necessity that existed that no institution of that nature should be managed by Government, bat by volunteers.tho learned gentleman want on to say, with regard to the criminal population, that hs for one certainly, did not regret transportation had been discontinued, since it at least had had the effect of making the public perform ts duty, and reform their criminals, instead of merely getting rid of them. Some remedy mnust be devised to meot the great evil-an evil which, as regarded the juvenile ofifnder, was fast accuimulating, as aUl might see by looking over the returns and taking averages of the last five years. The provisions of Sir S. Nortlicote's bill 'would counteract this evil, by making tho expense of partinaintenanceof the child while in thereformatory be borne by the parents; that at least they should pay something more towards his keep than it would have cost them to keep the child hones' at homie. (Hear, bear.) He recollected an incident that occurred to the great Lord Eldon, who when a toy had robbed an orchard with his brother, and the farmer had snummoned Lord Eldon's father as well as the two boys, and the father was fined 30s. The lttle boys did not mind that, but their father did, and he had accordingly flogged them so severely that they never once thought of robbing orchards again. Now, if on that occasion, instead of punishing the father, the boys had been committed to gaol, was it likely that little Johnny Scott would ever have sat on the woolsack or administered laws for this kingdom ? (Hear, hear.) That was the principle that was required to be enforced now-.
(Cheers.)
The H on. A. KINNAIRD briefly seconded the resolution, illustrating what might fairly be hoped and expected from the working of the reformatory principle by what had taken. place at Glasgow, where no less than SO per cent. of those who had passedthrough thereformatory schools atthat place were now doing wells and many of them holding situations of trust and responsibility. (Cheers. )

The Supply Of Cotton.
THE SUPPLY OF COTTON.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TI31ES.
Sir,-At a time when, judging from Manchester meetings and numerous letters to the London and provincial papers, a state of alarm appears to be getting chronic as to the sapply of cotton, I ventura to address you a few remarks on that very important topic, which yon may perhaps deem worthy of insertion in your widely-circulated journal. All classes of men are apt to rush into extreme opinions, but mercantile men especiaUy would appear to be led away by the impulse of the day, as the series of commercial crises which have occurred in this country unhappily prove. Unnatural depression or undue exaltation prevail ia the produca market by turns; but the other day, with a stock of 90,000,0001b. of tea, equal to consumption for 18 months at least, teas were seUing at price s ruinous to importers. The Eame teas, with but the chance of a pause in supply from China, which may or may not be realized, have advanced 60 per cent., teas seUing in August last at 9d. per pound Ilcing now worth Is. 1.d.
For some years past I have been interested in the cottonmarket, and have watched its phases with the interest of a merchant at all times affected by their developement. Probably no article is the medium of such continual speculationmercantile gambling-as cotton, or is subject to more extreme fluctuations of price. But that I should unduly trespass upon your columns a history of the way in which speculation is " got up" in Liverpool might not bo uninstructive. The question under consideration at present, however, is, whethertho world's supplyof cotton is unequal to the demand which exists and the consumption which is going on. The present high value of all descriptions of cotton and the reduced stocks would appear to give an affirmative reply. But I am inclined to think that under the stimulus of the prices which have now been exercising their influence for some months the supplies of the staple 'of which the real importance to the int erests of this country cannot be exaggerated) wiUl flow in with an abundanco which will amply supply existing wants. It is, of course, in the highest degree desirable that the cultivation of cotton should be promoted in India, and aU other suitable localties, with a view to providing for the increasing consumption, which at moderate priCes wil continuo to progress; but should the present speculative scale of prices bh kept up much longer, con5umption will be materially diminished, and then, undor the influenco of dear money, or the poss ible chances of a bad harvest in this country and a very large crop of cotton ix America. 1857-58, prices may be as unduly depressed, and very disastrous consequences be the result. It is I rincipally with reference to this last prospeot that I venture to raise a voice of warning.
Consumption already feels the influence of high prices. The consumption for the first six weeks in 1857 is 191,89S bales, against 247,930 bales in 1856-a decrease of 56,000 bales, or nearly 10,0D0 bales a-week. This, if it continuei, would be equal to a reduction of 500,000 bales in the consumption of the year. Now, the entire consumption in 1856 was about 2,250,000 bales-tho total import about 2,450,000 bales. Our present consumption is about 36,000 a-week (as far as I can coilectit from brokers' price currents), which would make the consumption of the year under 2,000,000 bales. It is probable that the consumption of the past year shows an exceptional ratio of increase, owing to the termination of the war and the consequent demand for Russian and some o ther continental markets denuded of stocks.
The American crop now coming forward is estimated as low as 3,000,000 bales, and it is stated that the cultivation cannot be extended boyond present limits, with present supply of labour; that the crop of last year-say, 3,500,000 bales-must be looked upon as a mcarimum. Precisely the same averments were made in 1850. Prices of *' fair" New Orleans then rose to Sid., the American crop being 2,400,000 bales; the following year the crop was 3,000,000 bales, and and the same cotton fell to 5d. per lb.
The import of American cotton into England in 1855 was 1,625,000 bales out of a crop of 2,800,000 bales in 1856 it was 1,750,000 bales out of a crop of 3,500,000; an equal quantity may possibly be sent out of a crop of 3,000,000 bales of the present season; while from India, owing to the stoppage of the China trade and the attraction of English high prices, the import will probably not be less than 600,000.
A word as to the production of cotton in India. Lot two years of high prices prevail in the Liverpool markot, and I venture to say that the production of Indian cotton will need no further fostering. The reason why cotton cultivation has not extended in India more rapidly is that on an average of years it has given but a very poor return to the cultivator.
Hitherto it is only when the American crop has proved short that Indian cotton has realised a paying price. In 1847, '48, '51, '53, and '54 " fair" Surats were selling under 4d. per lb., which would not leave a paying price for the cultivator. In 1852 and 1855 the price was just over 4d. per lb. In 1850 and 1856 only high prices have been obtained. One of the most enterprising firms in Bombay endeavoured for years to keep up a cotton farm, but English prices were too low to remunorate tho attempt.
I place no reliance on the statements circulated that America has reached the snzimum crop. I fnUy expert to see one of four miUions of bales, and that before long. Should it happen, howover, that supplies thence for a time do not increase, the stimulus of high prices will do for India what even the opening up of raiLways alone will not-lead to a largely increased cultivation of cotton there.
With the high prices of cotton in 1850 the same cry was raised in Manchester-" Why does not India supplyus with mnore cotton I" IThe Government ought to promote the growth, encourage the ryots, and so forth." Large crops from America and consequent low prices follow for some years, and the subject is never reverted to,
India can grow ten times the present quantity of cotton if India can ftnd a sale for it. The introduction of railways will, of course, greatly acilitate the conveyance of cotton to the coast, more especiaUy from the southern districts, but a permanent remunerating price alone can lead to general extension of cultivation.
Yours faithfully,
A BUMtAY MERCEANT.

London, Thursday, February 12, 1857.
rO0YDON, THURSDAY, FEBRUABY 12, 1857.
In the House of Commons yesterday, after a considerable time had been occupied in private business,
Mr. CRAuTJuRD moved the second reading of the Judgments Execution, &c., Bill.
Colonel FRENcH opposed the bill, especially its application to Ireland, and moved to defer the second reading for six months.
This amendment was seconded by Mr. M'MHoN, who urged that in various cases the bill would work great injustice.
Mr. BLAND, Mr. GEOrPGE, and Mr. H. HUGHES strongly objected to the bill, which was supported by Air. HADFIELD.
Mr. FITZGERAILD defended the bill the nature of which, he observed, had been misunderstood or misrepresented, its object being to remedy a state of things which was a disgrace to the law. The bill had gone through a select committee, where all its objectionable provisions had been expunged, and its prnciple had been four times sanctioned by the House.
Mr. NA=IR observed that after the biU had passed the select committee, it had been discussed and rejected by the House. He admitted that there had been some misconception and exaggeration respecting the measure, but it was by no means a perfect one, and he pointed out two main objections. The law of judgments was a large branch of our jurisprudence, and oug,ht to be treated as a whole.
The ATTORNEY-GENERAL, in supporting the biU, observed that there were two classes of objections to it; first, that there were more Irish than English debtors; second, that there were technical details in the bill which required amendment. These might be obviated in the committee, and, as to the former objection, he did not believe that any Irish member would found his opposition to the biU upon the ground that it would give English creditors greater facilities for compelling a large class of Irish debtors to pay their debts.
Upon a division the second reading was caxTied by 56 against 46.
On the motion of Sir F. BARING the Committee on Public Moneys was reappointed.
The House adjourned at 10 minutes to 4 o'clock.

The reduced Estimates have now been pub-
The reduced Estimates have now been published, and we are enabled to lay before our readers the sweeping reductions which are to lighten the burden of taxation and give once more free play to the national energies. To begin with the Navy; the sum asked for the expenses of the present financial year amounts to only 8,109,1681., in place of 15,812,1271., the estimate for last year. Furthermore, as by an act of last session the Coastguard is transferred to the Admiralty, and its cost is now included in the Naval Estimates, we must make a further reduction of 486,0281. In other words, the total decrease on the year is the difference between 16,298,1551. and 8,109,1681.-that is 8,188,9871. The reductions effected in the Army and Ordnance Estimates are not less striking. The total snm demanded for the year is little more than 11,000,0001. Now, the Armyand OrdnanceEstimate for 1856-7 was no less than 34,998,5041., and even the revised estimate when the war closed was 20,249,0841. Thus, even compared with the past year of peace, the reduction is no less than 9,000,0001. The cost of our military and naval defences is therefore reduced from 36,547,2391. for 1856-7 to little more than 19,000,0001. for 1857-8. The saving effected is consequently upwards of 17,000,0001., a million more than the sum produceed by the whole Income-tax of 16d. in the pound.
We believe, therefore, that the just wishes of the public are to be gratified, and that the CuANcELLOR of the EXCHEQuER will announceto-morrow that he is prepared to relinquish the 9d. in the pound of extra Income-tax which was imposed to meet the exigencies of the war. The Government will deserve all credit in listening thus readily to the public voice. There can be no doubt that the nation, after two years of extraordinary exertion,was beginning to feel sorely pressed by the weight of the Income-tax. For the last three months the complaints have been every day increasing, and the cry swelled into a tone so deep that it could no longer be disregarded. A Ministry might, indeed, 1 brave unpopularity, and, by the help of Parliai mentary supporters, inflict on the nation another
year of the obnoxious impost. But such boldness is rather a questionable virtue at the present day; and, so far from admiring any such vigour of will, the country is disposed to confide most in the men. who show most sympathy with its wishes, and are endowed with that better courage which
raises them above the fear of being thought weal; and inconsistent.
We should be the last to desire that the defences of the country should be weakened in deference to any popular outcry for sudden retrenchment; but there seems no reason to doubt that the sums to be voted for the present year wil be amply sufficient for the purposes of the State. Nineteen milions sterling will, even after the reductions caused by Parliamentary and popular pressure, be voted for the military and naval service of the country, and this sum is much above what was thought necessary in the period which preceded the war. In fact, the estimates against which Mr. HRux and his friends were accustomed to declaim rarely exceeded a total of 17,000,0001. The reduction of the Naval expenditure may be accounted for without suggesting any fear that Britain is about to abandon her just position on the seas. The decrease is chiefly in the votes for the conveyance of troops, for building and repairing vessels, and for providing stores. Thus " Conveyance of troops" last year-a year of peace-cost 4,965,9181.; this year it will cost only 207,0001. Those who wish to form some notion of the expense of actual war should consider this item. Nearly 5,000,0001. sterling must have been expended Last year in bringing home the British army from the Crimea. The "Wages to Seamen and Marines" have not decreased more than one-sixth, or from 2,601,9221. to 2,149,3331. We may therefore conclude that a sufficient number of vessels is still to be kept in comnnission. But "Naval " Stores, &c., for the building and repair of ships," and " New Works, Improvements, and Repairs in "the Yards," are considerably reduced. This is what might be expected.
It must be remembered that the war has given us a complete " plant," and all that is now necessary is to keep in order what has been constructed. Since the beginning of 1853 we have been building screw line-of-battle ships and frigates without cessation, and of the former we certainly must by this time have enough, considering that these overgrown constructions are not able to approach within range of three-fourths of the harbours in the globe. The steam batteries and the gunboat fleet are all ready for the first enemy who may excite the anger of England. We may presume, then, that with the exception of a few experimental frigates to rival those extraordinary vesselswhich thenAmericans have recently launched, naval shipbuilding is at rest for a few months. The Estimates ought therefore to be amply sufficient, for any one who inquires into these things will find that sailors cost little in comparison with the craft they sail in, and that we may keep up our squadrons in every ocean for a very moderate sum, so long as we refrain from adding to the number of monstrous hulks which encumber Portsmouth and Plymouth.
In the old times the Army used to cost somewhat less than the sister service. This year, however, Army and Ordnance together are estimated to cost considerably more than the Navy. The Army, however, is in a state of transition, and reforms, experiments, and even good intentions, are expensive things. In fact, the country seerms likely to have at last a really serviceable military force, though a small one. Of course, officers will continue to inveigh against the faultfinders of the last war, and to deny more or less that any one was to blame. This may be the tone in public, but we are glad to believe that there is a general conviction of the necessity of a better system, and that a large estimate for the Arry and Ordnance will not be thrown away. However, 11,225,5331. seems certainly enough. Europe is at peace, and the two greatest continental Powers are reasonably desirous of preserving tranquillity. Both Russia and France confess to having been exhausted by the late war. One is our ally; the other, though she does not dissemble her feelings, proclaims her desire, we believe sincerely, to be at peace with us and the rest of the world. If ever warlike preparations might be relaxed through a confidence in peace, it is at the present time. The country is wiling that all the defects which the war showed to exist in our system should be promptly made good, and that both the Army and Navy should be kept in such a state that at the commencement of any future troubles the transition from peace to war may not find us scandalously unprepared. But there is no wish to alter the established policy of the country, or to assimilate the army of England to that of a continental State. We trust, then, these 19,000,0001. will be enough to keep our Army, Navy, and Ordnance in a state of efficiency for the present year. If there were any chance of the improvements suggested by the last war being retarded by a sudden reduction, we thinthe nation would submit to even a higher estimate rather than forfeit the advantages to be derived from such a lesson. But with what the great expenditure of the last two years has left us, and what the 19,000,0001. of this year will produce, the departments on which the safety of the nation depends may be efficiently maintained.
With respect to the benefits which will be at once derived from the reduction of taxation there cannot be two opinions. Such a call as onefifteenth of a man's income to be paid directly to the taxgatherer is too severe to be supported for more than a short term of danger or enthusiasm. The temper of the country during the late war was one on which any politician might depend, and of which any patriot might be proud. Every private feeling was, to a degree unsurpassed in our history, sacrificed to the common good. But it would not be prudent, even if it were possible, to try this devotion too far. A country like ours, small in size, and relying for its eminence on the elasticity of its industry, cannot afford to prolong a form of taxation which depresses even more than it exhausts. The Income-tax has become obnoxious for many reasons, and not the least is, that it is levied in a manner which brings home the magnitude of the sacrifice most strikingly to the imagination of the payer. The contemplated reduction, and the entire abolition, which must shortly take place, will be felt by the
country as an inexpressible relief. WVith regard to the measure of the present year, it is probable that the good resolution of the Ministry will be amply rewarded. The loss in revenue will by no means equal the reduction in taxation. The relief given wil increase wonderfully the trade and resources of the country. British exports have nearly doubled in seven years, and in all material respects the nation is enjoying a prosperity beyond precedent. A great increase may therefore be looked for in the returns from the Excise and Customs, and even in the diminished Income-tax itself. By the end of the year we have little doubt that both Ministry and people will congratulate themselves on the retrenchment which is now finaliy resolved on.

We are told that there is a ghost in every house,
We are told that there is a ghost in every house, a spectre in every family, and certainly the present Government-that happy family over which Lorl P&ALRSTON presides with so mach patriarchal grace and dignity-is no exception to the general rule. In private life and in vulgar houses this -unwelcome guest, whenever an opportunity has been afforded of observing his movements, manifests
his presence by ugly noises and senseless sounds, by absurd rappings and knockings, by ringing of bells and rattling of panes and shutters, by mere hubbub and clatter in fact, by sheer rant and stamping. He rarely speaks, and then not very much to the purpose ; he still more rarely shows himself in a visible shape, and then only to a housemaid on the back stairs, who instantly faUs down, faints away, and breaks the family teapot or some other precious heirloom, which has been confided to her by an anxious mistress, in the firm faith that it would be speedily and safely deposited in the ancestral china-closet on the second floor. Well ! all this is provoking enough in every-day life and private houses, but what shall we say to public life and the Houses of Parliament ? What shall we say to a ghost in these, and what shall we say to an Administration saddled with such an incubus, haunted by such a spectre, and on whose shoulders a perpetual Old Man of the Mountain sits inexorably astride? It is sad, but it is the
simple truth I The LORD CHANCELLO.R-we say
it with unfeigned respect for his office-is such a spectre, and such an incubus to the present Government. Year after year he appears on the woolsack in the House of Lords, and-differing from the domestic ghost in this, that he is only too visible-night after night he potters and chatters and hems and haws, and mumbles and fumbles over this bill and that bill, until that venerable assembly is fairly bored and frightened out of its propriety, rejects all the bils iu a panic, and rushes to an adjournment, to escape the intolerable apparition of the Old Woman of the Woolsack, who inspires it with such unmitigated disgust.
It 'was said of a restless people of antiquity, that the condition of their existence was neither to be quiet themselves nor to let others be quiet, and so of Lord CRANsWORTH we may say, that the condition of his existence is neither to pass any bills himself, nor to let any one else pass them. In fact, he is the legislator who always stops the way; by his creeping carriage we are all brought to a perpetual block. The mind is bewildered in the effort to recollect the various attempts of a man who, advocating LawReform, backed by a powerful majority, and leading his forces year after year to attack the old strongholds of legal chicanery and delay, has yet conducted his operations so unskilfully that each summer has seen him beaten back with disgrace and derision,-a general who has never taken a single town nor won a single battle, the steps of whose career are marked only by a succession of pitiful defeats. What has become of the many schemes for simplifying and consolidating the Statute Law, that vast mass of legislation which contains so few grains of gold among so many tons of dross? What has become of the Bills for the Amendment of the Law of Divorce, for the Correction of Clerks, for the Reform of the Testamentary Jurisdiction, on all of which this eminent Law Reformer has had, as it were, a carae blanche, on all of which he has tried his hand, and in all signally failed? WVho, we should be glad to know, is that deluding spirit, that political will-of-the wisp, that has so often led the Government astray on questions of Constitutional Law? Who carried it away after him into the quagmires of doubtful precedent, until, having started on unsound ground from the very first, it at last got fairly bogg,ed and planted up to its ears in dirt and disgrace in the dismal swamp of Lord WENSLEYDALE'S Life Peerage ? To all these questions the answer, we are sorry to say, must be Lord CRAxwonTn, a man whose legal reputation, never of very great proportions, has dwindled away ever since he sat on the woolsack, until the dignity of the office has become sadly impaired by the inefficient and impracticable nature of the man who fills it.
We have been led to these painful reflections on Lord CRABiwOOTH by the lamentable exhibition which took place in the House of Lords on Tuesday night, when the LORD C .iciCELLoP. rose to explain the course he intended to pursue with regard to the Ecclesiastical Law. The nature of that exhibition may be imagined from the universal consternation caused in the minds of the other Law Lords by the announcement of these three notable schemes for the reform of the Law of Wills, of the Churck Discipline Act, and of the Law of Divorce. There is no one in the country, and certainly no one of the noble Lords who spoke on this occasion, who does not earnestly desire that these three branches of Ecclesiastical Law should be speedily and efficiently reformed; but when we find the mellow eloquence of Ly-DHURST, the chastened severity and sarcasm of BROUCHAN, 'and the shrewdness and sagacity of Lord CAMPBELL, aU veteran Law Reformers, combining, more in sorrow than in anger, to stigmatize the absurdities of each of these schenmes, and to warn the CnHMeLOPtlat he was not "in the "right path," we may be sure that thereis something radically wrong in the constitution of a mind so little able to appreciate the wants of the age, so incapable of profiting by past experience, and so obstinately bent on carrying out a pet notion of Law Reform in defiance of all remonstrance and in the teeth of repeated failures. With regard to Divorce, well might Lord CA3IPBELL express "his " dismay at hearing that any married couple, after "a temporary disagreement or after improper col"lusion, might obtain a divorce for all practical
purposes except marrying again ;" for this is not one of the many grievances of the present law against which public clamour is raised; on the contrary, it is one of those dangerous facilities which a crude and blundering attempt at reform will afford to vice and immnorality. Well might the same learned Lord utter the hope that the new Court would not be a Court of Chancery, into which he knewv " that many per"sons considered it the greatest calamity to be "thrown," for no judge has had greater opportanities of observing the misery entailed by this system of Chancery proceedings, which Lord CRANwOrTa regards with such favour, than the Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench. Well might Lord Lm3DHIURsT expose the fallacy which stupidly attempted to make the new Court of Probate a Court of Chancery in substance, though not in express terms, and warn Lord CRAm)VORTH against repeating his former mistalke and the mistake of the
ATTomsEY-GENERAL, by supposing that the public would prefer to exchange the Prerogative Court of Canterbury for the High Court of Chancery; for, if there be one branch of our legal system wh*ieh stinL-s in the nostrils of the public more than another, it is just this Court of Chancery, with its interminable delays, vexatious rules, and halting jurisdiction. Well might he deprecate the frequent appeals from a Vice-Chancellor to the Lords Justices, from the Lords Justices to the Lord Chancellor, and from the Lord Chancellor to the House of Lords, in exchange for a single appeal to that most popular tribunal, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. No I the nation feels that, wbatever may be the defects of the existing form of procedure in the Ecclesiastical Courts, any change which should tbrow all the wills of the country into Chancery, at the mercy of a profession some of whom are notoriously unscrupulous, must be regarded as a change from better to worse, as a fall from a more bearable to an intolerable place of torment.
But it was reserved for Lord BRouaHAr to sum up all the absurdities of the new Testamentary Court in a single sentence-" A new Court, under " an Equity Judge, exercising a common law juris" diction." We have heard of natural monsters, of strange abortions, of legal fictions, but we do not
remember ever to have heard of such a jumble of jurisdictions as this. First, we have a new Court where none is wanted, but simply a reform of the old one; then we hear that this new Court is to be a Court of Chancery, in order to carry out Lord CRMAwORTHiS favourite scheme; and then this Chancery Judge is to be tied to common law procedure. That is to say, he will, besides transacting his ordinary business of ViceChancellor, have to work in his new Court with a new form of procedure, to which he is not only an utter stranger, but with which the practice of his regular court is often at daggers drawn. Really, the existence of this unfortunate functionary will present a duality ever at variance with itself, so that lie will lead the life of the Siamese Twins when that unhappy couple became enamoured of the same woman. His common law and his Chancery law, like oil and vinegar, will never mix. There are many mninor objections to Lord CnA.iwoRTais testamentary scheme, which we have neither time nor space to dwell on; but, if he will tal-e a word of advice in good part, he will rather attempt to make the best of an old Court than try to make the worst of a new one. lVhat the public requires is the reform of the testamentary jurisdiction, and this may be best done, not by throwing all the wills of the country into Chancery, but by extending the powers of the old Court, by changing it into a Queen's instead of allowing it to remain the Archbishop's Court, by abolishing local jurisdictions, by simplifying its procedure, by establishing one probate for all England, by admitting fresh blood to practise in the court, and, though last not least, by repealing that absurd provision which enacts that the proctor shall not act as agent to a solicitor. If these changes were introduced the Testamentary Court or the Court of Probate would stand on a better footing taln any other Court in the country, the public and the solicitors would both be satisfied, we skould hear no more abuse of Doctors'-eommons, and we can assure Lord CRANWORTH that about the only persons in the country who would then raise their voices for a transfer of this jurisdiction to Chancery would be
himself and Sir R}CEARD BETHELL.

Among the subjects brought under the notice of
Among the subjects brought under the notice of Parliament in the first week of its session we find, as was naturally to be expected, the annexation of the kingdom of Oude to the territories of British India. A Parliamnentary return just issued contains a copy of a letter recently addressed by the Court of Directors to the GovwERoR-GENERAL on this important matter, in which their views of the case, and, incidentally, those of the Indian Government also, are explained with considerable detail. This document, however, contains no critical analysis of the principles involved in the proceeding, but starts from the annexation as an accomplished fact, and deals only with the various arrangements suggested by the occasion. Yet in this respect the communication is extremely interesting-perhaps, indeed, more generaly so than it would have been if it had turned exclusively upon the antecedent relations of the Court of Lucknow and the Supreme Government of India. It is not every day that an extensive kingdom with a martial population changes hands in the course of an hour or two. The reader may recollect, perhaps, Mr. MACAIULAY'S description of the difficulties which occurred when the rule of King WILi.u3i was substituted, although peaceably, for the rule of King JA,,ES. The case of Oude certainly presents few direct analogies to the incidents of a European revolution, but some of its featares are of a cheracter exceedingly remarkable.
The misconceptions or the ignorance formerly prevailing with respect to Indian affairs have been so much abated of late years that we need offer but little preliminary information concerning the subject before us. Onde was one of the native States of India, among which it held an exalted place, not rso mnch from the extent of its territories as from the title of its ruler, the fertility and position of the country, and the character of the population. As a province of the old Mogul empire it was governed by a Nabob, who held office during pleasure; but the particular magnate who found himself in possession of the placo in the early part of the last century availed himself of the decline of the Imperial power to makle his office hereditary in his own family. This occurred in the reign of our GEORGE II.; and, as the Mogul dynasty crumbled away more and more completely, the Nabobs of Oude became more and more considerable. Presently, however, the empire of India was revived in a more majestic shape than ever; the East India Company became the representatives of AKBAR and AURuNCzEBE, and the Nabobs of Oude found the new masters reigning at Calcutta more formidable than those who had reigned at Delhi. At first our relations with these magnates took a character from our own unconfirmed position, but at the beginning of this century our supremacy received a very decided expression in a treaty (that of 1801) which deprived the Nabob of extensive territories, and only left him the remainder umder the political control of the Company, and upon an engagement that he would establish a proper system of administration therein. A few years later (1818) the son and successor of this Nabob was gratified by the then Governor-General (the Marquis of HASTINOS) with the Royal title, and became accordingly King of OUDE. A short time ago, under circumstances into which we do not enter at present, the treaty of 1801 was held to be nilliffed through the systematic violation of its conditions by the Kings of OUDE, and the country was brought under the administration of the Supreme Government of India. The paper now before us explains some of the arrangements by which this remarkable transfer was attended.
It must be understood that this province or "kingdom" of Oude was a State which, though representing but a very smaU portion of the magnificent empire of India, contained, nevertheless, 25,000 square miles and 5,000,000 inhabitants. Moreover, it was a " native" State,-i.e., it had been governed time out of niind by Orientals and in Oriental fashion. It is true that the actual dynasty, as we have said, was only of muAern creation, but its antiquity was respectable as such things go in India; all its institutions bore the Indian character, and Lucknow, its capital, is one of the most purely Eastern and medimval-looking towns in all Hindcstan. This perfection of Orientalism was attended with its natural incidents in other respects. The ryot, or actual tiller of the soil, had paid his taxes to the zemindar, or great landholder, but these functionaries had not so universally accounted for their receipts to the Royal Treasury; while the army, computed nominally at 00,000, was irregularly paid, and had been allowed compensation in the privilege of rapine. Now, when an administration of this kind was superseded aU of a sudden by rule like our own, what was to be done with the KING and the people-with the KING who, though deposed from the power, was stiU to enjoy the luxuries of royalty-with the people whose claims were to be considered, whose interests were to be protected, and whose good disposition was to be conciliated ? There was no lack of strength in the matter. The Supreme Government was powerful enough to override and crush any resistance in a moment, but it was naturaUly an
object of great solicitude that there should be no bloodshed or disturbance, and this object was completely attained.
In the first place, what was to be done with the KNG t Was he to be still considered a King, and, if so, were his heirs to succeed to the like'title and was the title to carry a revenue? Now, though no other person in Oude might murmur at the change of Government, it was certainly to be anticipated that the KING himself would do so, and by way, therefore, of procuring not merely his submission, which was inevitable, but his adhesion to the proceeding, it was originally proposed that the titular sovereignty should descend in the family and be supported by a guaranteed pension of 150,0001. per annum. But the Krra would not become a consenting party, and the transaction was accomplished without him. The British Government assumed the administration of Oude by proclamation, provided for the conduct of affairs by British officers, and entered upon these functions, as the letter observes, " without the expenditure of a " drop of blood, and almost without a murmur." Under these circumstances, and the resolutions of the Company being left unfettered, it has been thought best by the Court of Directors not to prolong a mimic sovereignty, even in title, beyond the lifetime of the present KING, but to appropriate upon an ultimate agreement a stipend of 120,0001. a-year for the benefit of his lawful heirs as wel as himself. As an additional advantage, it is suggested that about 50,0004 of this revenue should be conveyed in the shape' of a " jagheer," or landed estate, the possession of which woould carry a species of territorial dignity, while its management would provide a kind of occupation for the owners.
The next consideration touched the zemindars.' Some of these stood indebted to the Treasury, and the question was whether their debts should be exacted by the efficient power of the new Government, or whether their possible disaffection should be obviated by a condonation of their dues. Upon the whole, it appeared best to the authorities both at home and on the spot that the outstanding revenue sbould be got in, but in every other instance the principle of sacrifice seems to have been preferred. The army, for instance, required much care. Not only had provision to be made either for incorporating or disbanding this mass of troops, but their pay was in arrear. These arrears, however, were liquidated on a liberal understaiding; pensions and gratuities were granted to a certain proportion of the soldiery, according to rank and length of service, and the remainder were organized in an irregular corps or absorbed in a species of military police. Here, in fact, lay the chief difficulty of the wvhole proceeding. It is one of the features of a native Court that it provides a kind of military career for bands of men who would not readily take to any other occupation, and the necessary dismissal of many of these involves unavoidable risks of disturbance to the Government and the country. However, we surmounted the difficulty in the case of the most military State in India, the Punjab, though there our operations had been facilitated by a victorious war, and it is hardly to be feared that we shall fail at Lucknow after succeeding at Lahore.
Such were the material circumstances attending our actual assumption of the Government in Oude. We are certairly not without some experience in such matters, but it is seldom that so important an act has been consummated with such perfect tranquiUity. We may assume without much hazard of mistake that when provision had been made for the satisfaction of particular claims there really existed no reason for repining at the change. It is even intimated that the adhesion of the Ki-?G may have been withheld, at least in part, under the influence of evil counsel, and certainly, considering the very limited nature of his former sovereignty, it is hard to see what desirable privileges he foregoes by descending to the possession of a rich estate. That his subjects shall be immediate and undoubted gainers it is now our bounden duty to insure.

Whatever may be the conclusions at which Par-
Whatever may be the conclusions at which Parliament may arrive with regard to the exezata qua3stio of divorce, we trust the Houses will not permit this session to go by without the entire abolition of that form of action which is commonly called an action for CRDiN. CoN. No matter how the law maybe altered as to the great question of divorce, let us at least get rid of this blot upon our system of criminal jurisprudence-we had almost said of this stain upon our national character. This form of action is useless, inappropriate, mischievous, unjust, and filtby. It is useless, inasmuch as the real romedy for the wrong. inflicted is obtained elsewhere and by an entirely different form of proceeding. It is inappropriate, inasmuch as it professes to give a compensation in money for an injury which money cannot touch. It is mischievous, because, in so far as it has any effect at all, it tends to promote the idea that any inpricipled person who has destroyed the peace of a family may put himself right with the world again by the liquidation of the damages. The amnsement in wvhich he has been indulging may be more or less costly according to the temper of the jury, but when he has paid the score the defendant is, commercially speaking, clear. It is unjust in the highest degree, because the one person whose character is most immediately at stake is not representedl before the Court which tries the case. A couple of unprincipled villains-one acting as plaintiff, the other as defendant-may by collusion for ever blast the character of the most innocent woman, and she is literally powerless in the matter. It is filthy, because the trial of a case of this kind necessarily involves the publication of the most disgusting and revolting details, which should if possible be kept hidden altogether from public notice. Surely, nobody will contend that the moral tone of British society is at all improved by the publication of the report of a case so utterly and entirely abominable as that of "LUNG v. CROKl;E," which we were most reluctantly compelled to lay before our readers in our impression of Monday last. True, by the most careful and anxious supervision, we may now and then succeed in striking out a few points of glaring obscenity, but enough will always remain to tickle the palate of the lecherous and, it may be, to poison the imaginations of the young. No one who has not had the misfortune of discharging such an office cant conceive the irksomeness of such a censorship. If you detract so much ordure from one scale, it is necessary to remove so much filth from the other ; or, at least, to endeavour so to do, lest either party should complain that injustice had been done. Too much or too little is always left. It may, indeed, be said that, in any case, if a divorce is to be granted, particulars and details of the grounds upon which the application is founded must always be given, and if these grounds are a violation of chastity the point must be substantiated. W-e reply, in the first place, that there cae be no necessity for publishing three editions of the ab'ooination when one woould snffice; in the second place, that the filth is never so filthy as when it is manipulated by the practised hands of the counsel, wvhose duty it is to mako out a case to the satisfaction of a jury; and finally, that if we could get rid of this commonlaw action, means might readily be devised for 'wrapping up the evidence in such a manner as
*vould be suffcient for the ends of justice without Qolluting the public mind.
The wonderful thing about this old abuse is that 'it continues to hold its place in our system of jurisprudence although for years and years every ,man whose opinion has been entitled to respect -has Continued to exclaim against it. Foreigners ,point to these reports with im-disguised satisfaction, and with sarcasm which is not disguised at all, and say they constitute good evidence of the venal character of the English people, who are ready to varter anything for gold,-ay, if the merchandise be the fair fame of their wives and their own honour. Send the Englishman away with a few hiundred pounds in his pocket, and lie wiU quietly *acquiesce in an injury for which a Spaniard would Lave dealt a secret death-stab and a Frenchman have exacted satisfaction in the fielt. How far from -the real truth this is Englishmeni know well 'enough, but appearances are against us. We are well aware that in the existing state of our law this action is but the foundation, the only foun-dation upon wvhich we can base an application to Parliament for an act to dissolve a marriage; but the explanation is ever received by a stranger with a smile of incredulity. Even in England the disgust against this form -of proceeding is loudly enough expressed. It was but on Tuesday night, when Lord LYNDRURST 'vas commenting upon the wonderful omission of all reference to this point in the CIRANCELLOn'S proposals for divorce, thrt he is reported to have 'aad, " I say, my Lords, it is scaudalous, and wholly
Inconsistent with the manly character of this "4 country for a man to attempt to satisfy the laws " of honour by having recourse to a proceeding of ':this nature." Lord LYNDHUR18T added that when -the details of the CHANCELLOe'S Bill were under consideration he should seek to introduce a clause for the entire abolition of this most objectionable forni of action. Lord BatouGonxE supported the same view. He remarked upou the cruelty inflicted on the wife by this suit, " when the woman whose
c character was at stake was not permitted to be a party to the suit, and when she might be the "victim of a conspiracy between the husband and "the alleged adulterer." It woould, however, be euperfluous in such a case to heap up the testimony of great Rames, for the form of action stands selfcondemned in the eyes of anl nien who have -one particle of self-respect or dignity of character. Setting the injustice done to the woman for a moment out of the question, -can anything more cruel to the deceived husband be well imagined than to force him into a public court of justice, there to substantiate by the filthy evidence of servants and watchers the story of his own wrongs, and-let philosophy say 'what it will-of his own dishonour? It is not to be denied that he would have in some measure to adopt the same course in seeking for a dissolution of the marriage; but the object in view gives a very different colour to the whole proceeding. In the case of the action for criminal conversation his ianguage is-" The defendant has polluted my " wife. Gentlemen of the jury, how much shall 5' we say for the injury ? 5,0001 ?-1,0001. ? " 5001. ' I will recount to you scenes of filth "in which my wife, the mother of my children, " was a chief actor, and when you have heard " the tale I am confident you will give " me the larger sum." He then proceeds to make out his case, and to haggle and -vrangie with his adversary for a little more gold. Jn the case of the divorce the husband's language -vears quite a different complexion. It amounts to this :-" My Lords, this womani has violated "every duty which she took upon herself when "she became niy wife. She has dishonoured me "and her children. I would have her removed "from the hearth which she has darkened, and "from the home to which she has brought shame 'in place of happiness. Free me from her pre-
sence !" It is not necessary in such a case to launch oiut inito the full particulars with which the prurient imaginations of the lascivious are gratified whenever a trial for criminal conversation takes place before a common law court. It is enough if an act of adultery be made out, and the unchaste wife may be discarded, the ill-starred union be dissolved.
WVe have so far offered a few remarks upon the aianner in which the dignity and security of the 'husband and the wife stand affected by this abominable form of action; but it maybe said,-" Is "the adulterer to escape scot free ? True, the peou'"niary penalty-the fine-may not be much, but it "is always soniethina. It marks at least the sense
ientertained by the community of the character of " his crinie." We say, however, that if society really intends to inflict a penalty upon the adulterer, let it not be a fine of trifling amount, carefully calculated so as not to cripple ilis means. Let him be arraigned at once at the bar of a criminal court, and, if the charge against him be made out, let him be consigned like any other malefactor to a term of penal servitude, whatever his station in society may be. If there is to be punishment at all, let it be a reality, not a mockery. If, on the other hand, the temper and maaimers of the age do not admit of such a course, do not let us go through the farce of flogging an acknowledged criminal with a bunch of ostrich feathers. We will conclude these few remarks as we began them, by an expression of our earnest hope that during this session we shaU see an end for ever of this disgraceful action of Crim. Con. It is almost a pity that this point should be ineluded in a divorce bill, which will give rise to protracted discussion, and which may not improbably incur rejection. Whether the CHAINCELLO1'S Bill be passed or not, this form of action should receive its qtietus at any rate.

America.
AMERICA.
IIVERPOOL, FrB. II.
The Royal mail steamship America arrived to-day with advices from New York and Boston to the 29th ult. She has brought no specie.
On the 30th ult. the America passed the Arabia, hence for Boston.
The America's regular day for sailing was the 28th, but owing to the density of the ice she was detained until the following day.
The day before that appointed for the sailing of the steamer the Boston authorities engaged an icedealing firm to cut a channel from Cunard-wharf, East Boston, to the open sea (a distance of seven or eight miles), 75 feet in width. The contracters immediately put on a force of 300 men at the outer edge of the ice. On the 28th (the steamer's advertised day of sailing) the channel was clear up to witbin a short distance of the wharf, and a tug was sent uo and down to keep it clear. It was thought that the America would be able to free herself from the ice in which she was embedded. On attempting to do so, however, she made but little progress, and that with injury to her paddlewbeels. After persevering for several hours her departure was postponed until the following day, when by great exertions a channel was opened and she got away. Multitudes assembledto witness the scene, and sleighs and refreshmeut-stalls abounded on the ice. In returning home the sightseers had to take a circuitous route, the channel preventing them from going back as they came.
It was likely that the United States' mail steam ship Atlantic would not leave with the mails of the 31st ult., owing to the damage she had received from ice. In the event of her detention the steam ship City of Washington would bring her mails.
The Arago, from Southampton, had arrived at New York.
In the Senate a comnmittee of inquiry had been appointed to consider the expediency of sending a commission to the Indian Archipelago to investigate the claims to the sovereignty of most of those islands asserted by the Government of the Netherlands.
In the House Mr. Campbell, on behalf of the majority of the Committee of Ways and Means, reported an amended tariff bill. The bill, as modified, embraces the following features:-
" Schedules 5, 10, and 15 per cent. of the act of 1846. with few excepti ,ns, are observed by the free list; the 40 per cent, schedule, principally spices, is also, with the exception of a few items, carried to the free list, which reduces the revenue about s$,000,000; the 100 per cent. schedule, spirit, is brought down one-half. Sugar, molasses, lead, salt, wool, and hemp are put at 10 per cent., reducipg the revenues about $7,000,000. Iron, ceotton, woollen, and silk manufactures are retained as now. The 20, 25, and 30 per cent. schedules are not materially chlanged, but some items in them are carried to the free list. The direct reduction of the revenues annually will be about $13,000,000, which it is supposed will be increased some millions by tbe effects of the measure in substituting home manufactures for those imported."
The Submarine Telegraph Bill had been referred to a Committee of Ways and Means.
The Hon. Preston S. Brookes, of South Carolina the senator who, it will be recollected, caned Mr. Sumner, died at Washington on the 27th. He had been confined to his bed for two days, suffering from a severe cold. He was telling his friends he had passed the crisis of his illness and felt considerably improved in health, when he was seized with violent croup, and died in about 10 minutes afterwards. His end was intensely painful.
Several Filibusters had been arrested on board the steamship Tennessee, which was about to sail for Nicaragua, two of whom (Fabens and Lawrence) being unable to give bail, were committed to prison.
MIr. Stringer, of one of the New Orleans banks, had absconded to Havannah with $50,000.
Respecting the Central American Treaty the Washington correspondent of the New York Courier and Inquirer says:-
" In one of my letters intercepted by the storm, and now possibly hopelessly wandering through the dark domnains of the snow king, I stated that the Senate Comnfittee on Foreign Affairs had reported the treaty with Great Britain respecting Central America, with a recomnmendation that it be confirmed. I believe that Mr. Douglas was not present when the report was made nor when it was agreed upon in committee, but it seems that General Cass was, and entered no objection. Mr. Douglas and Mr. Pugh have since, in the Senate, expressed some dissatisfaction with the principle of the new arrangement, and have therefore given the friends of the treaty some reason to apprehend that they will interpose an active opposition. It appears that, notwithseanding the covert denunciation of the measure by the organ of the Virginia Democracy, Senator Mason, Mr. Brown, Mr. Hunter, Mr. SlidellU and the other representative men of the ' Young South' have been notified as consenting to the treaty ' out of coinpliment to old Marcy,' as one of them irreverently expressed himself. The discussion upon the treacy is set down for the 28th inst., and is to proceed by easy stages until the 4th March, or until stopped by ratification. The Senate will have less disposition to an extended extra session than in former inangurative years, by reason of the new compensation law, which allows an annual salary, and not a per diem pay."
At New York an old offender had been sentenced to imprisonment for life for garotting a man; an assistant garotter was punished with a sentence of 15 years.
The newspapers chronicle the occurrence of many disasters to shipping consequent upon the severity of the weather on the American coast. The New York and Liverpool packet ship Irene, after being blown on and olf the coast for some days, the crew suffering severely from frost-bite, went ashore during a heavy snow storm off Long Island, and unless the weather soon settled would be a total wreck. She was thickly covered with ice from keel to truck, The Bremen bark Ann, 80 days out, was also ashore. Her passengers, 180 in number, were safely landed. The mail steamer Black Warrior, while on her voyage from Havannah to New York, encountered a terrific store, accompanied with snow and sleet, which lasted for 52 hours. She lost two of her masts, had her decks completely swept and her boats carried away. Her fuel became exhausted, and the cabins, furniture, &c., had to be burnt in the furnaces to keep up steam. She reached New York in a most dilapidated condition. The British ship Lord Ashbnrton, bound from Toulon for St. John's, Now Brunswick, had been totally lost on Grand Manan. All her officers and crew, wvith the exception of eight men, perished. The survivors were badly frozen. The United States' storeship Relief had gone to sea in tow of a tug to afford assistance to vessels in distress, but more especially to look for the British brig Princess Louisa, which was reported to be somewhere near Sandy Hook, short of provisions and water, and her crow badly frostbitten. The steamer Arctic was at first ordered to sail, but she could not be got out of the ice, though her volunteer crew worked hard to release her.
The IlUinois had arrived at New York with the California mails of the 5th ult., and $1,170,000 in specie. At San Francisco business was extremely dull. The arrivals of golddust from the interior were increasing, but bars were scarce. The firm of Cook, Frejer, and Co., and of A. J. Donner had suspended payment. A very heavy snowstorm had been experienced.
The Royal mail steamship Thames had arrived at AspinwaU from Greytown. She had on board 35 Filibusters, who were immediately transferred to a steamer, which sailed without delay for Greytown, to receive other Filibusters and convey them to New Orleans. Walker, according to these advices, which are very meagre, had evacuated Rivas, and
was at St. George's surrounded by the allies; who had offered him terms of surrender. As he was cut off from supplies it was hourly expected that his followers would accept the proposals of the allies. There was a rumour that the steamer Sierra Nevada had been captured by the Costa Ricano, and that, in consequeuce, the United States' sloop St. MIary's would leave Panama for Punta Arenas,
From Bogota we learn that revolutionary movements were in progress there and at Carthagena. The object was to form a federal government, and overthrow the Administration.
The Magdalena Company's steamer foundered off Savanilla on the 23d of December; 12 men, including the chief engineer and mate, perished.
Advices from Havannah to the 25th report the occurrence of heavy gales, attended with numerous disasters to shipping. The British ship Cosmo was stranded on Pacific Reef. Sugars were active and firm; inferior whites, 141 to 15 reals; superior, 17 to 19J reals. Stock on hand, 15,000 boxes. Molasses were in limited demand. Freights were unchanged. Sterling exchange had slightly improved.
Telegraphic advices to Boston report that in the New York money-market there was an increasin',
supply of capital, with a downward ten&xey in the sates. On the 26th ult. the quotationswere 8. to 9 per cent. for first-class names at tiwe4. and four months, and 10 to 13 per cent. foz- faW or second

ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY.-A crowded meet-
ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SociETY.-A crowded meeting of this society was held on Monday evening, Sir R. L hlurchison, President, in the chair. The papers read were -L Notes on the Route from Bushire to Shiraz; by Lieutenant-General W. Monteith, F.R.G.S. General Monteith thought the passes between the two places to be less formidable than generally beheved; he had repeatedly traversed and examined them. No doubt there were many and serious ditliculties to be met with in the shape of de. ficiency in quantity and indifference in quality of the water in many places, the difficulty of crossing the ravines, and buch like obstacles; but he thought that in neither of the two great passes were there insurmountable obstacles to conveying an army along them. There were a number of tribes in the various districts along these passes; but he beheved, upon the whole, they were rather friendly than otherwise. Sir R. Murchison, in moving a vote of thanks to General Monteith for his paper, said that in 1831 that gentleman had produced before them a MS. map, which had long since been published, relating to the northern districts of Persia. and particularly to the southern flanks of the Caucasus. He was well qualified to speak to them on the subject of Persia, and the society was much indebted to him for his valuable information. 2. Observations on the geography of Southern Persia, with reference to the pending military operations, by Colonel Sir Henry Rawlinson.-By a curious accident the place where the English troops came into collision with the Persians was the most interesting, in an historical and antiquarian sense, of any in the country, and had formerly been the chief place along the coast of the Persian Gulf, and the fort at Bushire was said tc have been built by, or was caUed the " Fort of Nebuchadnezzar," The Persian Gulf, from the earliest time, had always been the great route of communication between India and Europe, and the author proceeded to explain the situation of the different great commercial emporia from the most ancient up to the present time. The coast of the Persisn Gulf contained a belt of low land throughout, with mountains at a short distance, varying from 10 to 30 miles. At Pushire it was about 25 miles. Having been a good deal in Persia, he was satisfied that they might take guns anywhere so long as they were not opposed ; by putting a regiment to a gun they might take it on through the passes; but the Toads in Persia he L-new wvere extremely bad. At the same time, he should say that it was quite
impossible to force the passes alluded to by General Monteith in the face of an enemy. Should Government be determined to act with effect on Persia, quite another route must be taken. The army must, in fact, land higher up the Gulf, at Mohammerah, and proceed to Shuster.-Mr. Layard quite agreed that, if the war upon which we were now engaged was to be continued, the seat of our operations, or rather the position which our arniy must hold,
nmust be transferred from Bushire to the upper country. lr. Layard then proceeded to give an interesting narrative of his travels in Persia, and of the incidents and adventures,he had met with in his intercourse with the native tribes. The President, after thanking Sir Henry PRawlinson, adjourned the meeting until the 23d inst.

CRI IE W THEv W EST.-We reported in The Times a few days ago that a large number of burglaries and robberies had been committed at Plymouth. During the last few days similar offences have been commaitted in varioUs parts of Devonshire. A poor woman, named Maria Copp, while on the road from Bideford to Buckland Bremer, was brutally attacked a few days ago by a negro named John Hebdue. The miscreant took away the bundle which she was carrying, and on her resisting he took a large knife and threatened 'with an oath to stab her. She was so alarmed that she dropped her infant which she was carrying in her arms and ran away. The robber pursued her and stabbed her with the knife, but fortunately her clothes prevented the infliction of any serious in ury, A boy on horsebaek coming to the spot at the time frightened the robber,and he fled, but he was afterwards captured and com mitted by the maistrates to take
his trial. A few nights ago the shop of Mr. Lombardini,
jeweller, of Torquay, was broken into and a large quanti t
of gold rings, chains, and other valuables, was stolen. A house in Grosveior.place, Exeter, occupied by respectable ! people, was broken into on Sunday night, and some valuable

NEW YORK, A.9. 2'.
The arrival of the steamer James Adger from San Juan del Norte has brought some fuller, but not much additional, inteligence from Nicaragua. It confirms generally the accounts forwarded by former letters. General Henningsen had escapedfrom the church, or rather fort by the church, between Granada and the lake, in which he and his party were surrounded. They had sustained great loss from the fire of the enemy, disease, drunkenness, and want of food. He had joined Walker at Rivas with the remnant of his band, and described the incidents of his 20 days of difficulty in a long report, which forms the bulk of the present mail. The steamers on the San Juan, formerly belonging to the Transit Company, which had been seized by Walker, and sold or transferred to a rival association, have been captured by a clever manceuvre, authorized by Mr. Vanderbilt, of New York, their old proprietor, and dexterously carried into execution by one of his employes, and abundant details of the operation are given. Yet of real intelligence there is little. Of the chief agent of this miserable war, Walker, nothing that can be rehled on is known. There is every reason to believe he is at Rivas, with a force of about a thousand men, of whom at least a third, by one account, is disabled by disease ; by another they are all in good health and spirits; they have not received so many reinforcements as supposed, only a few recruits having arrived from California, and the last batch from New York is still shut up at Puntas Arenas, unable to descend the river, Henningsen's shattered remnant can hardly be called an increase of strength, and unless he can take the offensive and strike some blow to recover the ground he has lost by being driven from Masaya and Granada, his position does not appear much improved by recent events, though his friends in this city contend that it has. He is isolated between the lake Nicaragua and the Pacific; the steamer he had on the inland waters is captured, and all the line of communication with the Atlantic is in the hands of his enemies, who are acting under leaders and support furnished by the capitalists with whose property he has dealt eo unceremoniously. His native foes are less to be dreaded than some of the enemies he has made for himself in New York. There is no doubt of the depth of their hatred, and they have just displayed singular tact and energy, in both which the Costa Ricans have been very deficient. As far as can be gathered from the extraordinary confusion of the different accounts, it seems to be the policy of the Costa Rican forces not to risk any attack on Walker, but gradually to surround him, cut off his supplies and reinforcements, and leave those most active allies of the native Governments, fever and the climate, to do the rest. In any active fight with Americans and Mississippi rifles the CostaRicans would, in all probability, get theworstof it; but they arequite equal to the tactics ofablockade, being numerous enough, and able to find provisions. WVithout some extraordinary coup on the part of Walker himself, or the 300 men shut up at Puntas Arenas, his condition is veryprecarious, but, while any movement of the kind is possible, may not be wholly desperate, and that is about all that can be said.
There are two distinct incidents in the Nicaraouan warfare of the past month which, in the absence of any political news, are worth some notice. The first is the retreat of General Henningsen from the burning city of Granada, destroyed by the orders of Walker, his defence, which was almost a 20 days' fight between the citv and the fort on the lake, and his final relief andescape with a remnant of his force; it is a passage of hard fighting, dreadful suffering, disease, and death, without any result to the cause at issue. The other is the adroit seizure of the river steamers by a man named Spencer quietly done, with scarcely any fighting at all, and that little against his orders but with an immense result to the Costa Ricans. At the date of the last accounts Walker had not heard of the blow.
First in point of time is the destruction of Granada, and the subsequent defensive fighting of Henningsen and his force in their retreat on the lake, as described at length in his own report te Walker. It is the clearest account yet given of any of the operations in Nicaragua, giving some distinct notion of the nature of the country, the character of Walker's men, with few exceptions the scum of the American seaboard cities, and the Costa Rican mode of fighting. In this respect it contrasts favourably with the foggy and magniloquent reports that were wont to appear in the Nicaraguense in the days when Walker had cities and newspapers. They were grandly obscure, and painted defects as victories, and thus the two fatal checks of Masaya and Granada were described as brilliant triumphs. Henningsen's report does not slur over disaster in this manner, and shows, sometimes unconsciously, what was the feeling of the natives and the morale of his own men. Henningsen is an
Englishman by birth, a soldier of fortune, but not| a fortunate soldier, for by some fatality he has always been on the wrong side; he served with the Carlists in Spain, in the Hungarian war, and is now one of the Lieutenants of Walker, whose "lone star" does not seem to be in the ascendant. The destruction of Granada was his first service, and in the diflicult retreat from it he displayed courage and resource worthy, to use a hackneved phrase, of a better cause. During the summer he was in New York, a prosperous gentleman, florid and peaceable in look, surrounded by the splendours and good things of a fashionable hotel, which may have been remembered in the days so soon to succeed of horse and dog flesh, fever, cholera, bad brandy, and hard fighting under a tropical sun. Henningsen took with him from New York a considerable supply of military stores, and arrived at Nicaragua about the time Walker had met with his two signal defeats at Granada and Masays. The former place it was determined to abandon, and Henningsen was ordered to embark all the guns and stores on the lake and then destroy the city. This was done on the 22d of November. That the destruction of Granada was more an act of revenge than a military necessity appears from a somewhat ridiculous proceeding, like a few others described in the course of the report, and which make it, though dismal enough in its essentials, almost amusing. an the 11th of November he stuck up a placard on the road "opposite the ruins of the last house of the city, " notifying to the wotld that " here stood Granada," a very weak substitute for a pyramid. While the stores were being collected his men broke open some large depots of wine and brandy, and drank to excess; as a consequence, fever and cholera broke out, and the number of sick, added to the wounded, embarrassed the retreat. Notwithstanding the notice that Granada had ceased to exist on the 11th, the American force was attacked in the city on the 22d of November, and the enemy found cover enough to oblige Henningsen to build barricades and continue a course of house-fightiDg till the 27th, blowing up the cathedral torwer in the interval. On the 27th the retreat began, and he threw himself into the Guadaloupe Church, between the city and the lake, fighting his wav down and into it, over or past some barricades; it was a barricade battle throughout, the Costa Ricans trying to close him in with them, and, in fact, succeeding, as he had to build a field-work or fort subsequently as a shelter, the church becoming untenable from the stench of decaying bodies, which added to the sickness among his men. While surrounded in the church, constantly at-
tackced, and compelled to save ammunition by only firing when the enemy came close, he received a summons to surrender for "humanity's sake" .nd to save bloodshed. It promised all the party their lives, good treatment, and passports out of the country.
To this summons the Costa Rican commanders received the following astonishing reply:-
"To ZAVALA, BSLLOSO, AND THE OTHER RMExS AND
PRIvATz LEADERS WHOS NASIES I C,UNNOT WASTF THE MIR TO DECIrHR:-
" Sirs,-1 have no parley to hold with men whom I know lie. I regret for the good of the cause, to be obliged to offer uthat if you lay down your arms in two hours your Ives w bll e spared; if not, within six months I wMill
in the name of the Government I represent, hang you all
as high as Haman. Price, as a traitor, I intend to detain
and shoot, but I return one of your prisoners captured yesterday. '"C. F. }ENNflIGSEN,
*Acting in the name of the Commander-in-Chief
and President of the Republic of Nicaragua."
Price, who had been sent in with the letter, was not shot, nor at the last dates had any of the other parties been hung. For ten days continual attacks were made on the church and the little fort, wh9hl were repulsed and gradually grew weaker. On the 8th of December, General Zavala, un'aead, by the threat of hng , sent in anot,her sammons to surrender, again offering good 'treAiment to. aU his pris-t5e. Re said,_f
X% l=i very . eiJ :maA 3my podtiol. is here, &U,
what is yours. You see very wenl that the steamers by which you e.xpected to reoeive reinforom,, *s are not come, nor will they come, for no passengrs have; ded at San Juan del Sur, knowing haow things were here, bt t they went over to Panama. Those expected by Greytown have not been able to make their way through, Point eaetill, I being ii the hands of the Cost Ran troops. What can YOU then, expect ? and what win1 gain b having the neee;a 2tY of havingyou aU put to death, as will be most likely thC case if you do not accept the proposal 2
This offer was also refused in a verbal, but polite reply. On the 9th a steamer, with Walker on board, "appeared; be looked at them, and retired," without doing anything; this was repeated more than once afterwarEs, and made a very bad impression among the men. To eke out the rstore of ammunition Henniugsen made round shot by cutting up a small chain cable, and casting lead round the links, having rome spare ball cartridges, for which there uere no caps. Ia the next passage of the report something like a hint is given to " his Excellency" that if he could or would do nothing for the relief of his beleaguered troops he had better have stayed away:
"We had now been seven days without flour, short of salt, and reduced to four horses and one niule, and the imvrebuion began to spread dangerously in the camp that your Excellency had met vwith some great reverse, and desertions were taking place, confined principally to Cubans, Germans, Frenchmen, and a few Irish, only two Americans that I am aware of having passed the enemy. The appearance of the steamer which you sent to reconnoitre our position, instead of inspiring confidence, as before, wa now by many, from the fact of her not making any diversion in our favour, held as confirmation of some disaster to your force or person."
On the 10th of December the steamer again appeared, but this time with troops on board. The prospect of relief was seasonable, for the case was becoming desperate; they were hemmed in by baricades, and on that day Henningsen had killed iis own ihorse, " and the last dog but one was killed by the epicures in the camp for dog mutton." A Sand wich Islander was found, who undertook to swim out to the steamer on a log of wood, with a despatch corked in a phial, and, after some misunderstanding of signals, a relieving force was landed on the shore of the lake. Theyfound the road covered with barricades, and lost 40 men in attempting to carry them. Finally they struck off from the road, and made their way through the bush, and effected a junction at the church, and the relic of the force embarked on the 12th of December. The returns of the losses are not complete, but include the names of 52 officers kiLed or dead of disease. Only the skeleton of the force that destroyed Granada lived to escape by the lake.
The other operation, which has placed all Walker's means of communication with the Atlantic in the hands of his enemies, was much more easily accomplished. The man Spencer who conducted it was formerly a mate in the employ of the old Transit Company, aud felt no goodwill to Walker for destroying it. With the sanction of Mr. Vanderbilt he applied to the Costa Rican Government, and offered to re-capture the steamers. President Mora gave him 300 soldiers, with whom he floated down the San Carlos, a branch of the San Juan river, in canoes. Landing at a point above Serapiqui, on the 22d of December, he surprised a station there held by 40 men of Walker's force; of these 31 were either shot or drowned in attempting to escape by water, as Spencer declares, contrary to his orders; he was not with the attacking party, or he would have prevented it. The officer in charge of the fort is said to have been drunk wben it was attacked. Spencer and his party then descended the river in the night to Funtas Arenas, and took possession of the steamers, Bulwer, Wheeler, Machaw, and Morgan. Hie then returned up the river, as far as Castillo, and surprised and took the fort there, without firing a shot. About 20 miles above Castillo he took the Virgen, WValker's own steamer, in his voyages on the lake, and in which he reconnoitred Hlenning3en's position so discouragingly. There were on board 480 minie rifles, 6,000 rifle cartrldoes, 2 howitzers, 2 mortars, -with pow der, shell, ana shot. With this steamer he undertook to take Fort San Carlos, at the lake entrance of the San Juan. In the night of the 30th of December he landed 200 men below the fort. Knowing Walker's signals, he then gave two blows of the steam whistle, which was answered by a gun from the fort. Another blow from the whistle sid " All right," and the commander fell into the snare; he went on board with six men, and found himself a prisoner; the fort immediately surrendered. It has been stated that the English naval force abetted the seizure of the steamers; this is not the case. CaptainErskine, of the Orion, offered to protect any American citizens who might require protection; but, as the steamers were property disputed by two sets of owners, he would not decide to whom they belonged, and they had notoriously been employed as vessels of war against the Government; he therefore declined to interfere to prevent their seizure.
On the evening of the day the James Adger arrived there was a gathering of sympathizers here, who pronounced the news, on the whole. favourable. Captain Kruger, the officer in command of Fort San Carlos when Spencer took him and it, was present, and his account of the quick conveyance of the key of the river into the hands of the enemy may have raised their spirits; but they rAolved to send down another party of recruits by the Tennessee, which is announced to sail with " emigrants" this week; and in the present frozen out state of the labour-market they will moat likely succeed in getting them together, for the statements published in the journals opposed to Walker are not beheved, or explained in such a manner as to appear positive advantages. There is an incredible amount of stolid ignorance among the lower German and Irish population; and, though nearly 6,000 "recruits" have already found a grave in Nicaragua, and Walker's scrip is selling there at a discount of 95 per cent., they still believe that he can give them land, farms, and riches. The Isthmus is also the present outlet for many of the dangerous class of the metropolis, and, as highway and street robberies are increasing, the community regard every shipment to Nicaragua as a good riddance. It does aU the work of a penal settlement without its expense, and a departure for it is equivalent to a self-imposed sentence of transportation for life.
There are some signs of the weather relenting, but vinter is very unwilling to let go its grasp. The railroads have not wholly recovered from their paralysis, and seven mails are now due from the south. The Long Island Railroad, which connects Brooklyn with the rest of the world landwards, is buried under ten feet of snow, and no attempts have been made to dig it out; it is supposed the company are glad to be relieved of it for a time. The ferryboats are stiUl impeded, having to cut their way through floating icee; they make slow trips, at uncertain intervals, and every departure is a scene of fearful crowding and confusion. Even steam ferries cannot contend with the obstacles of winter, and if engineering science could devise any kind of bridge from the city to the main land, the project would find supporters, perhaps even subseribers under the pressure of present horrors, for there can be no doubt of the Bsuperiority of any "work pontifical" to the present system of communication. The harbour of New York, however, has not yet been completely shut to shipping; it has not closed up, which has been the casewith the ports of Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Boston. The Ameriea, which takes the present mail thence to Europe, is now having a channel cut through the ice for her departure to-morrow, after the manner of Arctic navigation.
The United States' steamer the Black Warrior arrived here yesterday from Cuba aU but a wreck, dismasted, her sails and boats blown and washed away, every bit of internal woodwork that could be spared burned to keep the engines going, and externally almost one crust of ice. In a 14 days' gale she has devoured her own inside, in endeavouring to keep her head to the wind. Most of the officers and crew came in frost-bitten. A more piteous spectacle than the Black Warrior now presents was never seen afloat.
An appropriation of $70,000 per annum has been made to the Atlantic Telegraph Company.
The House of Representatives has by a large majority passed an act increasing the pay of officers of the United States' Army $20 a-month. The delay of some measure of the kind had begun to produce an inconvenient number of resignations of comminssions.
According to an official table of the mercantile failures of the United States for 1856 there have been 2,705 bankruptcies, of which 708 were in the State of New York; of these 700 only 31 are set down as fraudulent.

Olympic Theatre.
OLYMPIC THEATRE.
A lively, noisy, rattling farce, of the old school, with the title A Splcndid Investrent, kept the Olympic audience in. a roar last night daring the whole time of its short. duration. The scene takes place in a tea-garden near Ramnsgate, to which Mr. Titus Fulgent (Mr. F. Robson), accompanied by his wife (Miss Castleton) and his father-inlaw (Mr. G. Cooke), has come down to enjoy himself. By the advice of his solicitor he has lent 1,0001. at the moderate interest of 50 per cent. to a gentleman whom he has never seen, named Rockingham (Mr. G. Vining). A. stranger, 'who arrives in a great bustle, proves to be the identical Rockingham, then in the act of eloping with Hiss Emily Fielding (Miss Karst on) from the care of her friends, and Fulgent learns that the marriage of this fond pair will alone afford him a chance of recovering his money. Now,, Rockingham's carriage has broken down and pursuers are close at hand, when Fulgent, with an air of thorough sympathy, proffers his services in any shape that may be most useful. Great are the horrors he drawsuponhis head by this interested benevolence. Be has to take care of Emily while Rockingham is looking for another vehicle, and thus incurs the jealous wrath of his wife, who cannot be made to understand that the apparent. firtation is a matter of regular business. When Emiltys. aunt enters upon the scene he is forced to create a diversiora by feigning that he himself is Rockingham, and thereby loses his best customer, for the old lady recogniaes her owlb grocer in the pretended roms, and asks for her account. A bailiff, who comes armed with a writ to arrest him in his simulated character, is another form of torment. After all this suffering his grief is. turned to rago by. the conduct of the base Rocking-
ham, who, thinking that he has lost Emily, talks of taking. as a substitute a pretty lady whom he sees in the distance, and who is no other than Mrs. Fulgent. The crushed worm, in a frenzy of indignation (one of Mr. Robson's masterpieces of passionate emotion), is nearly on the point of de. molishing his persecutor with a three-legged stool, which he grandly styles his " three-fold vengeance," when inteligence arrives that Emily's father consents to her union with Bockingham. Trouble now seases with its cause, and Fulgent, severely lesoned by the results of his "splendid investment," resolves that he will adhere to the modest profits of grocery, instea4 of adopting usury as a short cut to a rapid fortune. The motives-of this farce, which is by Mr. Bayle Bernard, are not remarkably newv; bat there is plenty of "fun" in the dialogue, and. what is still more, the incidents furnish a perpetual supply of hot water to keep up the amusing agonies of Arx Robson. A general burst of applauso followed the descent of that curtain,

TA portion of the following &ppeared iix oor second edUtion of vesterdav :-1
PARIS, TUTESDAY, FEB. 10, 6 P.M.
Since the appearance of the article in the Moniteur on the union of the Danubian Principalities the Ministerial journals have, in pursuance of instructions from official quarters, followed up the subject in a similar strain. The Pays and the Consitidimonel, the Arcadian brothers of the press (et eantaire pare-s), have to-day each an article on the union, and they not only advocate that measure on the grounds of good policy and in deference to the known wishes of the Moldo-Wallachian population, but they also affirm that Turkey herself, the Power most interested, earnestly desires it; and that the only Govermnents that still hold out are England and AUstria. These the Monite ur, no doubt, hopes to convert. As these articles bear the semiofficial impress of the French Foreign-office, and express its sentimentts, they merit attention to which otherwise they would have little claim. That it is the anxious desire of the Moldo-WaUachian provinces to be united is an assumption not warranted by proof. There is nothing as yet to show that they wish for amalgamation. I have little doubt that many of the refugees who attempted to revolutionize the country, and establish an ultrademocratic government, are in favour of the measure, but I have reason to believe that the MoldoWalachian people are en masse utterly indifferent to it. When they shaU express their desires, free from any pressure from without, unbiassed by Russia, Austria, or France, I am pretty confident that they will be found to express a wish to see an honest Administration established among them-a Government that wiU protect them from pretended friends or open enemies-that will improve their moral and material condition-that will open communicationsto enable them to dispose of their superfluous produce-and that wiUl save them from the vexations of local tyrants, and from the more extended and crushing cupidity of the Princes who are set over them. These are the improvements which the Moldo-WaUachians chiefly desire, and both the Moniitur and the journals that echo it, or prolong its notes, are mistaken if they suppose that the union occupies the greatest share in their thoughts. The Binisterial papers affirm that the Porte has changed its opinion, and no longer recognizes what was laid down in the Imperial firman as to the questions which should occupy the attention of the special Divams. If it be true that Turkey, whose sztzerainetW in respect of the Principalities has been recently and solemnly recognized, be favourable, that is, no doubt, a great point, though it is not all, for the interests of others are not to be entirely disregarded. But I doubt the truth of this statement. If the Porte had changed its mind the Ottoman Ambassador at this Court would not have, as I am assured he has, asked for information on the subject of the official article from the French Minister of Foreign Affairs. He expressed his surprise at such an article appearing in the organ of the Government after the Sultan's firman. He complained that that article seemed to him an infraction of the instructions given to the Commissioners by their respective Governments, no doubt to M. deTalleyrand as wellas to Sir H. Bulwer, viz., that they should observe much discretion in relation to the Principalities, and avoid doing or saying anything which could be construed into a desire to dictate to or infuence the Divans or the population in the expression of their wants and wishes. The article of the Monitear, he showed, was clearly inconsistent with these instructions. Some sort of answer was, no doubt, given to the Ambassador. He was, I am told, vaguely assured that no pressure was meant to be exercised in the Principalities, that the intentions of the French Government were excellent, &c. M. Hiubner is also said to have demanded explanations, on, I believe, special instructions from Vienna. The Turkish Government may have changed its opinion since then, but I know nothing certain of the fact, and until there is better proof than the Siamese twins of the Paris press alluded to I remain in my unbelief.
The principal objection of Austria to the union of the Principalities I have more than once stated. I do not take it upon myself to affirm its justice or the contrary, but it is one which touches her interests very nearly, and is perfectly intelligible to all. The union of the Principalities implies a Rouman state, enjoying nearly complete independence, under the rule of a foreign Prince, who would be, in spite of anything to the contrary, as much a creature of Russia as Iing Otho is. Now, it must be remembered that more than 4,000,000 of the same Rouman race acknowledge the sway of the Emperor of Austria. How long they would do so with the spectacle of an independent State side by side with them, and very probably in the enjoyment of constitutional or qumsi constitutional government, it is not difficult to guess. The spectre of Rouman independence would constantly haunt Austria. A considerable portion of her territory would be overrun by political propagandists, her population kept in constant agitation by political agents, and in self-defence she would have a large proportion of her army occupied in guarding the line of the Bukovina, Transylvania, and the Banat. Under such circumstances it is not extraordinary that a person authorized to speak officiaUy on the subject has declared that Austria would resist, by force if necessary, the union of the Principalities.
The recent declaration of the Moniteur on that subject, which seems to have taken most people by surprise, has once more attracted attention to it. Why, it is asked, does France persist so in going against Austria, Turkey, and England? Is there any secret cause which has not, and which probably cannot, be avowved as yet, but which will appear in good timue? This question I cannot answer. I mearely observe that a good deal of whispering is heard, which for aught I know may have very little foundation. There was a rumour at one time that a certain high functionary, who no doubt thinks he is the best judge of his own deserts, had cast his eye on the Moldo-Wallachian crowvn-even if the crown were some degrees below a Royal one. The rumouar was no doubt an absurd one, and it may therefore be dismissed. There is, however, now in raris one of those petty Princes who roam about, like wandering stars, in the political horizon. The Duke of Nassau has, it seems, come highly recommended by the Queen of Holland to some members of the Imperial family as well as to the Emperor himself. Her Dutch ifajesty is reported to have said, or written, in a charming off-hand sort of way, alluding to the Principalities :-" Voyons; est-ce qu'on ne peut pas faire quelque chose pour ce pauvre petit Nassau ?" The Duke would probably make as good a Prince of Moldo-Wallachia as any one else, and if it ba true that he is betrothed to a daughter of the Duke of Leuchtenberg, the niece of the Emaperor of Russia, and cousin of the Emperor of the French, Russia would not, any more than
France, pronounce him ineligible, in the event of theI Principalities being united and a foreign Prince placed over them. The firman of the Sultan seems conclusive on this subject of the union. It concludes with these words, which are alike an order and a menace:-
" The Sublime Porte expects from the Divan, that knowing how to imbue itself with the sentiment of its duties and its fidelity, it will not fail to keep its discussions within proper bounds, and will spare us the displeasure of having recourse to measures of protection against any attack on our august rights of suzerainetd."
A letter from Turin of the 8th inst. enumerates the deeds which the Sardinian Government has accomplished since the memorable day on which the late King, Charles Albert granted a Constitution to his subjects. During those nine years Piedmont hla carried on war twice with Austria and once with Russia. It has consolidated and developed its liberties. Its commercial prosperity has increased; its political and moral influence has been very great. Civil equality has been established in its laws, and the fullest practical liberty of discussion; civil power emancipated, and free
trade established with all nations; but, above all, 1
Piedmont is acknowledged officially by Europe
as the champion of order and progress in
Italy. Such are the immense results produced by
be4 yArs of constitutional government. In the
1qsy 184.8 there was not a mile of railway in
lont-at present there are hundreds, and Pw foot of the Alps is united to the Mediterra-
nean. During those nine years Piedmont has Jud t contend with many difficulties, and she has fortunately aurmounted them all. The flood of
reolutionand that of rtion have been broken against that rock which heltes the liberties and the hopes of Italy. Durig those nine years
'iedmonlt has develoAe itself, and beome the focus ,snd the source of Italoar life. Piedmont is free
because she preferred the wise, safe road of reform, to the perilous and deceptive course of revolution.
A letter from Milan of the 7th inst. announces that, besides the political prisoners pardoned by the Emperor at Milan, 13 have been liberated at Brescia, nine at Como, and seven at Pavia. EHis Majesty has further commanded that the criminal proceedigs commenced at Brescia against 44 inhabitants of that town for an attack on the Gendarmerie on the 8th of July, 1855, shall be quashed, and no further proceedings instituted. By a decree dated the 6th of February the town of Monza, which is a mere suburb of Milan, is raised to the rank and is to enjoy the privileges of an Imperial city. Notwithstanding the prolonged stay of the Emperor of Austria at Milan there is no apDearance of amicable relations between him and the court of Turin. The language of the official press of Milan towards the Sardinian Government is extremely bitter.
The PayJs publishes a letter from Trebizonde of the 20th of January, which announces that the advanced guard of Mirza Mehemed Khan's army, commanded by Fezlli Ehan, who is ordered to operate in Farsistan and to oppose the British troops, had quitted Irak Adjemi and moved forward. The object of Fezlali Ehan is to take possession of the defile of Bakhtery, on the borders of Bendemir and to prevent the British troops from advancing into the interior, should they quit Bushire. It may be recollected that the Russians during the war of 1828, though victorious on every other point, were never able to force the defile of Bakhtery, then defended by Abbas Mirza.
The following private telegraphic despatch has been received:-

MA.RSEILLES, Fm. 9.
A letter received here from Algiers, dated the 3d instant, remarks that the present winter is the most variable ever experienced in that colony. Sunday, the 2d, was a magnificent day: the sun was bright, the air mild, and a great portion of the population of the city, who had long been confined by bad wreather, took adlvantage of the change to walk into the country. With night, however, the bad weather returned, and the parties who had prepared themselves for a masked ball had to encounter hail, rain, and wind. It is curious to contrast the appearance of the chain of the Atlas, covered with snow, with the plain of the Sahel, where geraniums, roses, and violets are in fuU bloom, absolutely as if it were the middle of spring.
PERSIA.
The Teheran Gazette of the 26th Raby-el-thany (24th of December) publishes an explanatory reply to the En'lish declaration of war issued from Calcutta on the 1st of November. It says:-
" In his declaration of war the Governor-Goneral of the Indies accuses us of bad faith and of the infraction of treaties, while he blockades our ports with 30 vessels of war. The English Consul at Bender-Bushire, in communicating that declaration to the local authorities, added, that the arrival of the naval forces is simply the explanation of the contents of that declaration.
" Thus we are obliged to unveil the truth and to make all men understand that our accusers are themselves guilty of want of faith, breach of treaties, of injustice, and have created difficulties with a view to invade our territory.
"1 In explaining our rights and the real facts we wish that the justice of our cause may be appreciated by every one. It will be seen that the aggression was not on our side; that never did our Government endeavour to infringe a treaty existing between the two Governments; men will be convinced that, not satisfied with fulfilling the terms of the treaties, we did more than we were caUed upon to do. The proof will be given that the English agents have repeatedly violated the treaties, created embarrassments, and infringed upon the authority of the Persian Government.
"Thus it was that the rupture with Mr. Murray was caused by his own conduct and by the violation of our rights. As if it was not enough to attack the authority of the Government, the Minister of England wished to claim as a British subject a paid servant and real subject of His Majesty the Shah, Marza Hashem Rhan, who has given up English protection and returned to the service of his Sovereign. Moreover, Mr. Murray mixed himself up with the intrigues relating to Affghanistan in general, and to Herat in particular. And yet, according to all the treaties concluded between the two Cabinets:-1st, in 1809, with Sir Earford Jones; 2d, in 1812, with Mr. Crosley; and 3d, in 1814, with Mr. Ellis,-in all those existing treaties it was stipulated that the English Government should not interfere in Persian and Affghan affairs except as a mediator with the consent of both parties.
"The first infractions of these treaties by British agents took place in the reign of the late King Mohamed Shah, at the siege of Herat. The English Government sent vessels of war into the Persian Gulf, which act compelled the King to raise the siege. His Majesty, not wishing to break off friendly intercourse with England, renounced at that time the capture of Herat. At a later period Mr. Shiel assumed a cold and threatening manner; but the Couart of Teheran, always appreciating the friendship of England, contracted relative to Herat, a new arngement, based upon the internal relations of the country, such as they existed in the days of Kamram and of Yar Mahomed Khan. It was said then that the English should not interfere in any
case, or in any manner, in the affairs of Herat, and that they should not have any relations with the chiefs of the ead town. It is to be observed that that treaty must be null
and void according to all international law, which stipaulates that a treaty between two Powers shall be ratified, and the ratifications exchanged; these conditions were not fulfilled.
"Moreover, Mr. Shiel himself annulled that arrangement, and his successors have imitated his example; this is proved by official documents that have been communicated to us. It was by acts that Mr. Shiel infringed the arrangement agreed upon; he sent one of his confidante, Sultan Khan,
to Herat, and he oommenced relations that he had no businaes to enter into, for it had been expressly stipulated that a copy of the arrangement agreed upon should be sent to the Government of Herat. To the obeervations made then by the Teheran Cabinet to Mr. Shiel, that his conduct was contrary to stipulations, he replied offloially that he did nod regard himself bound not to hold communication with Herat, and that he should communicato with that town whenever ad u often as he pleased without informing the Persian Governm.t. In fact, these communications were made without interruption. After I§r. Shiel, the Charge d'Affaires, Mr.Thompson.even took advantage of
the departure of Molla Akram, the Seoretary of the Governor of Herat to entertin him outside the town, and to give him money ad a lUtter for Se'd Mahomed Ehan.
"Iu that letter it is id, 'that according to conventibus agroed upon with the sid secretary, Seid Mahomed Khan, whoeV intelligeuOe D4 capacity & e xppreoiotd5 W ill -r
ceive from the agent of England at Herat the necessary arms and ammunition and two kourours of money (480,000Z.), on condition that the English agents shall not be excluded from the affairs of Affghanistan, and that all who speak the Affghan tongue shaU be subject to it; that advice is given to SeMl Mahomed Khan to send one of his sons to the Governor-General of India, and that he wiM thus obtain all that he desires.' That letter is actuaUy in the archives of the Persian Government.
"Although we were informed of all the steps of the English agents we tolerated thom out of respect to the Endlish alliance. But the agents of Eogland put no limit4 to their compromising conduct. After the death of Kohundil Khan Dost Mahomed Khan seized upon tho town of Candahar, in defiance of the prohibition for any Government in these parts to invade a neighbouring State. Doat Mahomed was even resolved to seize upon Herat.
" While these events were taking place in Affghanistan the representatives of England maintained a strict silence on these questions, and caused us embarrassments on other matters. But as soon as Dost Mahomed Khan had seized Candahar (on the 4th of Reby-el-aouel) Mr. Murray, on the 9th of the same month, broko off his intercourse with the Persian Government. On the other hand, the chief per. sonages of Herat, as Shahzadeh Mahomed Youssouf, General lea Khan, the Sirdar Ahmed Khan, the Governor Mahomed Hussein Khan, Hadji Koulmoun Khan, Abbas Khan, and all the chief persona of that town, addressed a petition to the Persian Government concluding in the following terms:-
" ' We, the most devoted servants and faithful subjects of your Majesty, feel it our duty to inform you that Dost MIahomed Khan has just seized Candahar by order of the English Government, and that he has resolved to capture our town also. Bat, as he was not aware of the changes that have taken place here* and only heard of them at Ghuznee, he did not wish to remain at Candahar, but he at once gave orders for the preparation of the expedition against us; his sojourn at Candahar will not exceed seven days.
" ' According to letters which we have received from merchants and other persons, he openly declared his projects against our city.
" ' But, doubtless, you are not acquainted with the follies and treachery of Seid Mahomed Kban, nor with the state of disorder and want in which he has left the army and the population. It is quite impossible for uxs to hold out without your support. Ithon we have never been honoured with your kindness Or your gifts (khaP'l) we have always been your faithful and devoted servants. We therefore, beg of you to give us succour and to take us under your protection, now that Dost Mahomed declares himself the aggressor and the enemy of your Government, by placing himself in open rebellion against you.
'$'You have but to sigfy your orders to him by prescribing to him his duties, and by telling him that you have taken us under your Protection. If he Persists in his designs, toll him you will send us tho money and the troops requasite to defeat him, But, h the same tune, 8accour must he sent. toMs with Sam Khan el Ehani; for, rhould or towe n w e capred and destroyed, great evals would ensue and repissals would lead to nothing.'
" The Persian Government simply sent Sam Elsan, with. out troops, to the succour of Herat; Prince Hissan-ul. Mualk was at Djam, wiith some troops. But wye were not awareo-that Dost MIahomed had already gained and cor. rapted by bribery various personages inside Herat, such as the General lea Khan, and that he had induced them to revolt against Shahzadeh Mahomed Youssouf, to drive out Sam Ehan, sent to their aid, and .hahomed Youssouf Khan himself, should he oppose the expulsion of Sam Khan. After a sanguinary struggle Sam Khan was compelled to take to flight to Bagschah without troops; he was compelled to go on to Malak, where his death had been resolved upon. Informed of the conspiracy, Sam Khan sent a courier to the Prince Sultan Mnrad Mirza, and through a thousand dangers he escaped to Fort Chibika, where he found refuge. On receiving the news Prince Sultan Murad Mirza sent Pasha Khan to the aid of the fugitive. What is still worse is, that while Sam Khan and Pasha Khan were returning together from Fort Chibika to Kourioun the Sirdar Ahmed Eban was sent from HeIrat with 2,000 men to stop them, and massacre them and their small escort. Sultan Murad Mfirza, informed in time, hastened to support them with the few troops he could hastily bring together.
"Such has been the iniquitous conduct of the men of Herat. After having entreated the Persian Government to send them help to oppose the [invasion of Dost Mahomed, who wished to capture their town, they allowed themselves to e bribed by him, and tried to massacre their guests. What was the Government to do? Was it to submit to such a degradation as not to punish such excesse ? Moreover, it had before it an aggressor readyto seize upon Herat, and who, from that point, would have been a continual source of anxiety, and porhaps the ruin of the province of Khorassan.
" Under every circumstance it was the duty of the Persian Government to have a care that no foreign Power should seize the said town, of which it is the sole protector. Can it be supposed that it is not Dost Mahomed Khan who wishes to seize Herat, and not Ica Khan who calls him and who revolts? The letters of Dost Mahomed Khan, and of his son Ghoulab Haider Rhan, have fallen into the hands of the Persian Government, and they prove that it is Dost Mahomed Khan who caused Herat to rovolt with the aid of English promises; that English troops are marching in the direction of Nishapoor, and will reach Cabul; that money and ammunition have been sent toward Shikarpoor and have arrived at Pichong.
"H owever, the Court of Teheran, to maintain the friendship and the alliance of England, was decided, even after the capture of Herat, to organize there an Affghan Government according to conventions. Still more, it was not disinclined to give to Mr. Murray such satisfaction as was compatible with the dignity of the Persian Government. But that did not suffice; to those two demands others have been added. Lord Clarendon and Lord Redeliffe had put those two conditions, and conferences were held with the Persian Charge d'Affaires at the Sublime Porte. In consequence of the new exactions, Feruk Khan was sent with fuU powers, and his mission was notified to the EngliHA Ambassador.
" Nevertheless, before the arrival of Ferak Khan war was declared. On arriving at Constantinople Feruk Khan wished to communicate with Lord Redchffe; he received as a reply, that there were no more questions to be settled, that there was no need of conferring. After great difficulty negotiations were ultimately commenced; bat
in addition to the two points above-mentioned, the English Anbassador put forward claims which were inadmissible, and had nothing whatever to dowith the pending questions. Feruk Ehan, who had no authority to treat on this basis, asked for 40 days' delay to allow him to communicate wita his Goverhment; this arrangement, to which Lord Iledeliffe consented, was concluded on tho 26th of November, and yet on the 6th of December the English fleet attacked Bender-i-Mahiguiri (the Fisheries), which was bombarded and taken.
" After reading these facts every man will be able to judge for himself whether it is the Persians or the English that have infringed existing treaties."

TURIN, Fim. 7,
The Emperor and Empress of Austria, it is said, are to prolong their stay in Milan until the 5th of March or thereabouts. The cause of this change of plans has not been clearly given, but the state of the Empress's health is one reason assigned, the medical men being averse to her travelling at this time of the year. ln the meantime, no opportunity is lost of endeavouring to gain popularity with the Milanee by such means as Austrian policy wiR admit of. Festivities at Court and elsewhere, pablic exhibitions, &c., are used as stimulants to the dormant enthusiasm of the Milanese, but without much effect as far as the nobility are concerned, and it is a remarkable fact that the only classes on whom this display and eXpenditure has made a favourable impression are precisely those among whose ranks M.

On the 12th of this month it is said the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian is to be inaugurated in the post of Governor-General of the Italian Provinces. The district over which he is to reside will be sufficiently extensive, comprising, besides the Kingdom of the Lombardo-Veneto, the Italian Tyrol, and the ancient dependencies of the Venetian Republic on the eastern coast of the Adriatic; but his power will probablybe merely nominal, as "centralization"' is the whole sDirit of the Autrian system of government at the present day, and it is in deference tG this principle that his Imperia Hlighness is only to receive the rank of GovernorGeneral instead of that of Viceroy, and the Lom. bardo-Veneto is to lose the name of a kingdom.

It has more than once been suggested that Austria might some day erect a ecion of the house of Hapsburg as Sovereign over all these fiefs united, so as to oppose the growing influence of the house of Savoy in Italy, and so as to flatter the vanity of the Milanese, who have never forgotten that their city was once the capital of the KCingdom of Italy; and, if such an idea really does exist, it is more than probable that the Emperor would avail himself of the opportunity of honouring his favourite brother, the Archduke Maximilian.
The King of Bavaria left Milan on Thursday, the 5th, for Modena, on a visit to his sister and brother-in-law.
On the same day the Austrian troops, under command of General Baumgarten, marched out of the city of Parma for Piacenza, and thus the foreign occupation, which has lasted for eight years, has been at length withdrawn. Let us hope it may not be again renewed. Still, however, the Parmesan prisoners who were so unwarrantably carried off to the Austrian fortress of Mantua remain in durance, although the Lombard political prisoners there have been released; and, just as we hear of the removal of the military force, it is reported that the perseverance of Austria in urging the eontinuance of the Customs? League, and opposing the junction of the Parmesan and Piedmaontese Railways, is likely to be successful over the independent judgment of that weak Government.
The Grand Duke Michael of Russia, who arrived here the night before last fromNice, spent the whole of yesterday in visiting military establishments, and went out to the Venezia, the head-quarters of the artillery, when the troops were turned out and put through a series of evolutions for his gratification with all which he expressed himself very much pleased. In the evening there was a state dinner at the Royal Palace in his honour, and he afterwards accompanied the King of Sardinia and Prince Carignano to the Royal Theatre, which was illuminated a gio-o for the occasion. When the Royal party entered the audience,which was most inconveniently numerous, immediately rose and applauded violently and with a will, as one may say, for several minutes. There was no mistaking the source of this applause. There was no policeman wanted to give the signal and lead the " claque;" it came direct from the hearts of the people, and it might have served to show the young Muscovite Prince, if he appreciates such things, on what foundation the throne of King Victor Emmanuel rests. During the cheering the Grand Duke remained at the back of the box, as if he felt conscious that he was in no way concerned in this family display between the King and his subjects, and His Majesty did not consider it necessary to lead his guest forward to share in the applause, buit acknowledged it all on his own account with an aplomb that showed he was well accustomed to such demonstrations. The same acclamations were repeated when the Royal party retired at the end of the performance.
The Grand Duke left Turin at 1 a.m. this morning by special train for Susa, en route for Geneva.

THE PUBLIC REALTH.
(From the Registrar-General's Weekly Return.)
The deaths registered in London, which had been in the first week of January 1,135, and in the last week of the same month 1,209, rose in the week that ended last Saturday to 1,368. In the years 184746 the average number of deaths in the weeks corresponding with last week was 1,180If this average is raised for the purpose of comparison proportionaly to increase of population it wiU become 1,298; and hence it appears that the rate of mortality which prevailed last week was higher than the average rate in the beginning of February.
The increase which the present return shows on the deaths in January arises from the recent depression of temperature, which commenced towards the end of that month annd continued till near the end of last week. The weather was goneraUy mild in the first three weeks of the year; the mean temperature was 37 deg.; inthe fourth week it fell to 31 2 deg.; and last week it was 32-3 deg.; and on two days since the 28th ult. it has been 12 deg. below the average.
The deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs-the class which, more than others, rises and faUs with the flue. tuations of heat and cold-rose last week to 359. They bad been for some previous weeks about 280. The average of this class, corrected for increase of population, for ten weeks corresponding with last week is 235. The deaths from bronchitis in the last four weeks were 170, 164, 1I), and 224. The increase of pneumonia in the last week is much less considerable. Phthisis, which was fatal in the previous week in 146 cases, numbered last week 184 Whoopingcough carried off 61 children; and, as regards the extent to which it was fatal showed little change on recent weeks. A child died of whoopingcough at 2, Church-court, Westminster, being the fourth fatal case of this complaint in the same house. Four children died of measles in the Marylebone Workhouse ; the total number of deaths from this disease was 38. Only 3 deaths from smxllpox were re. gistered last week in London.
The deaths of four nonagenarians were returned; the two oldest of these aged persons-namely, a widow in Queenstreet, Ratcliffe, and a lady in Southampton-row, had attained the age of 96 years.
Last week the births of 976,boys and 915 girls, in aR 1,S91 children, were registered in London. In the ten corre. sponding weeks of the years 1847-56 the average number was 1,626.
At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height of the barometer in the week was 29-762 in. The lowest reading in the week was 29A41 in.; the higbest occurred on Wednesday, and was 30-14 in. The mean temperature of the week was 32-3 deg., which is 51 deg. below the average of the samo weeks in 43 years. The mean temperature of Sunday (the 1st) was 24-5 deg., which is 12-7 deg. below the average of the same day; the lowest temperature on Scn. day, which was also the lowest in the week, was 20 deg. The mean daily temperature continued below the average till Friday, on which day it was 42-2 deg. The highest reading in the week was obtained on Friday, and was 47-7 deg. The range of temperature in the week was 27-7 deg. The mean dew-point temperature was 29 deg., and the difference between this and the mean air teopera. ture was 3-3 deg. The wind blew at the beginng of the week generally from the south-east, on Wednesday from the north-east, and on the last three days from the southwest. Scarcely any rain fell; on Monday and Wednesday there was snow, but of smaU amount.

THE MiLITARY OUTRAGE AT THH CHATRAIe POsr_ OFFICE.-The Postmaster- General, on being mado acquainted with the particulars connected with the recent eutrage at tho Chatham Post-office by a party of the military belonging to that garrison, immediately ordered an official investigation into the circumstances, and this morning Mr. J. H. Newman, the Post-office Surveyor, will arrive at Cbatham for the purpose of commencing the inquiry. Mr. Dadd, the postmaster, is recovering from the effcts of the injuries he sustained in his encounter with the soldiers, and on Tuesday was sent for to attend again at the Brigade-Major's office, Chatham Barracks, for the purpose of giving him an opportunitJ of identifying any of his assailants. Mr. Randall, of the Mlitre Hotel, who had several of his windows broken, and Franklin, the sailor belonging to Her Majesty's ship Iris, who was stabbed by one of t7e soldiers, were also in attendance by order of Colonel Eden. for the purpose of identifying any of the Poldiers who are under arrest on suspicion of having been engaged in the outrage. Of the seven soldiers in custody four have been already recognized, and on this occasion the other three men, who belong to the 70th Regiment, were paraded with several other prisoners, to see if either of the witnesses could identify them, but they were unable to do so. A report of the outrage has been made to the authorities at tbe Horse Guards, but it is not yet decided what course will be adopted.

The Double Murder In Walworth.
1THE DOUBLE MURDER IN WALWORTE.
Yesterday Thomas Fuller Bacon and Martha Bacon, his wife, were brought up from Horsemonger-lane Gaol for further examination before Mr. ELLIOTT, charged with the wilful murder of their two infant children.
Long before the time appointed for the examination the court became inconveniently crowded, and, judging from the anxiety evinced by a number of persons whom the court would not hold to hear the proceedings, the caso at each examination sooms to increase in interest. It was the opinion of some that Mr. Alfred Taylor, the eminent professor of chymistry at Gny's Hospital, would have been present to give evidence respecting the analysis of the contents of the body of Mrs. Bacon, sen.; but this was a mistake, as the professor has not yet, nor will ho for some days have concluded his task. When the prisoner Bacon was brought to the court by the prison van, he, on being removed to the cell, appeared much more cheerfal than on any previous day, and the gaoler, observing him in such good spirits, asked him if he was aware that the body of his mother had been exhumed and examined, and he replied in the affirmative, adding that he was quite well aware of it. Cook, the gaoler, also asked him if ho was aware that his wife had confessed that she, by his desire, had put arsenic into the broth taken by the old woman, and that he (Bacon) had subsequently put some arsenic into her medicine? His reply to this was that he knew nothing about it and he should act under the advice of his solicitor. He then said he was very hungry and requested Cook to order him a beefsteak, as he wished to have something before his examination. The steak was ordered at a neighbouring tavern, and the prisoner ate about three-quarters of a pound, with a slice of bread and a pint of beer, with the keenest appetite.
The whole of the night charges having been disposed of, and the solicitors and witnesses being in attendance, the prisoners were taken into court at a quarter to 2 o'clock. Bacon was tho first to enter the dock. His manner on this occasion was quite different from and formed a perfect contrast to that which he exhibited at his former examinations. He entered tho dock with a firm step, and on getting to the upper end he turned round and faced the gaze of every one in the court. In fact his appearance was that of a person who was determined to brazen it out. Mrs. Bacon appears improving in health; she was accommodated with a seat at the solicitors' table, with her back to the dock, so that her husband, though he made several efforts, could not get a sight of her.
Mr. Woodward, as on the former examinations, attended for Bacon, and Mir. Crouch, from the office of Messrs. Wright and Banner, solicitors, London-street, city, appeared on behalf of Mrs. Bacon.
The first witness called was Mr. W. Harris, the surgeon to Horsemonger-lane Gaol, who said,-I recollect the female prisoner Mrs. Bacon being brought to Horsemonger-lane, and on that occasion the matron called my attention to some marks on her throat, which appeared to have been occasioned by a string having been drawn tightly round it. I should say itwasa string, an notarope. Therewerealsosome superficial wounds on the throat, but the prisoner said nothing to ne about how they had been occasioned. I have watched hor carefully, and I have come to the opinion that she is a person of unsound mind. She has that appearance; has a vacant look; won't look at you; and says nothing, but is sullen and quiet.
Mr. ELIJOTT.-You did not test her state of mind in any other way, but merely think her to be a person of unsound mind from her appearance and manner?
Witness.-Just so. The mark on the throat was just above the cuts, and was all round the neck, and tbe mark was very perceptible at the back part of the neck, so that the cord must have been tied round very tight, and the cord itself must have been very sharp, something resembling
Mr.ELLIOTT.-DO you think that such a mark may have been occasioned by her dress?
Witness.-I think not, for it was too high up and too straight or circular.
A piece of cord, between whipcord and sashline, which was found at the late residence of the prisoners, was here produced, and Mr. Harris said it was such a cord as was lkely to produce the mark he had described.
Mfr. ELLIOTT.-YOU say that the mark was above the wounds on the front of the throat. Is it your opinion that a cord might have been tied or drawn closely round so as to have caused that mark without its being stained or marked with bleed?
Witness.-It is my opinion that it might have been tied round and have no marks of blood.
Cross-examined by Mr. Crouch.-The cord produced would have caused the marks I have described. It did not require to be tied very tight to produce the mark; for if see-sawed when held tolerably tight, it would produce a similar mark as if tied very tight. She could herself have caused such a mark, but it was not the mark of a person who had been hanging. I ask her daily how she is, and from what I have seen of her I believe her to be of unsound mind; and I believe also the cuts on her throat were inflicted by herself, but they may have been Idone by anybody else. The cuts were so slight and superfi-
cial that any other person inflicting them must have been very careful not to kili her; and I think that if anybody else had done it it must have been by connivance.
Mr. Crouch.-Now, suppose it had been the object of the person inflicting these outs to deceive the police, and lead them to the supposition that Mr. Bacon had inflicted the injuries herself, were not the wounds just such wounds as would have been inflicted?
Witness.-Well, they are. They are not such wounds as were lkely to have been inflicted by a person intending to kml her.
Mr. ELLIOTT.-There is one question which I omitted. What quantity of blood do you think Mrs. Bacon lost at the time of receiving these injuries?
Witness.-I should think the quantity lost must have been but smalL The matron at the gaol showed me her chemise, and there was not much blood there.
Henry Woods was next ca11ed.-He said he lived in High-street, Reigate, and was in the employmont of Mr. Mallodge, an ironmonger there. On the Monday morning after Christmas-day he saw the male prisoner at the railway station at Reigate after he got out of the train, and soon after he saw him at his master's shop. He noticed something very particular in his manner, and he did not seem to know what he was doing. At about half-past 12 he came into the shop, when he (witness) asked him what o'clock it was, and he then saw him take a watch from his pocket, by which he told him the time. For five minutes at a time the prisoner used to stand looking on the ground, and he was evidently in a very distressed state of mind. In the evening witness pointed out a shop to tha prisoner where he could get a watchkey, and afterwards saw him at the Bel publichouse, where he had a bed, and he then asked him to sit down and have some brandy-and-water, but he refused as he did not like his manner or appearance. The prisoner then wore a pair of fustian trousers and an apron.
Samuel Perry, another man in the service of MIr. Malledge, said, the prisoner was in such a state of mind on the Monday that he could not do a bit of work. He used to throw his tools about, and stand as if studying for a whole quarter of an hour. He did not do any work at all, but merely looked at it, and spent his time in walking between his master's shop and the job where they were at work.
Charles May, another workman who was employed with the prisoner on the Tuesday, said, he did little or no work on that day, and did not seem to know what he was about.
The next witnes3, Wiliam Payne, of 15, Anglesea-street, Stepney, engineer, gave most important testimony. He said,-Bacon is my wife's nephew. On the Sunday evening after Christmas he came to me, to my wife's brother's, between 8 and 9 o'clock, but did not stop long- mv wife and he went off to see my daughter. I did not then notice that there was anything the matter with his finger, nor observe that it was tied up. I did not know that there was anything the matter with his finger till I saw it in the newspaper, and this induced me to look at it. I examined it, and told him I thought it had been done sharpening the knife on a steel. I thought so by theo cut, as it was right across the left hand forefinger between the first and second joints; he said he did not cut it that way; that he did it cutting a bit of meat at dinner; that his knives were new, and did not want sharpenin
[It may here be marked as a strange and suspicious coincidence that Dr. Bushell, on examining one of the knives found in the prisoner's room on the morning on which the murder was dscevered, expressed his opinion that it had all the appearance of having been recently sharpened on a steel, and this knife, when subsequently examined by a microscope, was found to be deeply stained with blood, and was the instrument with which, accordin to Ihis wife's confession, he cut his children's throats.] Mr. vPayne further proceeded to say,-I have talked to the prisoner a good deal about the affair, because he said he was sure his wife did not do it; that ho did not do it,- and that he had every reason to believe that somebody had unlocked the door, gone in, and had done all that had been done. I asked him if he had loft the key in the door when he went out, and he said he had not, that he took it out and hung it up, as was his common practico. I told him that it lay between him and his wife, for that no one would have gone in and done such a thing without taking the money that was there; and he said nothing to thatbut two or three days after he told me he had been robbed of a greatcoat and other clothes, and I asked him about the greatcoat. le said it was a rough greatcoat, and as I bad never seen him with such a coat I asked him who had made it. He hesitated and did not ausw er
and I then said, " Did your tailor make it? Because if he did the police will fiud itout." Hehesitatedcfor sometime, andthensaid he took itfora debt. Iasked himof whom, and he againhesitated, and said he could nottellme; butlconsidered the wholeof biestatementto be false. He also said ho bad lost a watch, but I never knew of his having but one watch, and that he brought back with him from IReigate. The watch now produced by Sergeant Broad is that watch, and its number is 32,793. I never saw the other watch, No. 13,663, now in the hands ofthe police, in hispossession until afterhe came back from Stamford, a week after the murder. In trying to wind it up at his lhouse the prisoner broke the glass, but, witb the exception of that inju it seemed to be perfect. I had not seen the watch 32,7938,rbt snubreventl
saw the one 13,663 with the scond-hand t sd te pn-
soner then said the police had caused the injury done to it; but at that time the face was not damiaged I told him when he advertised for the watch that he was a rat fool for doing so, that it would be sure to be picked up and brought forward, when he would have 5f. to pa' for it, and he said he wished he should. When the prisoner came the night before the murder he seemed yefI
much confused. Ms. BaCOn atalonidmem and Ivry
a,adIsaid to her, "I wonder how you can leave th e lItte childro"
And in a little time she replied, " Unole, you have no call to fret about the children; they are happy." That wasall she said.
Mlr. ELUOL r.-Whsn was this?
Witness.-On the night of the Sunday after Christmas, just two days before the murder was discovered.
Mr. ELLIOTT.-Then they had mot the children with them when they called on that night ?
Witness.-No Sir, and that was the reason I spole about their leaving them. Oa the Wednesday morning ater the murder. whe BAton cAmeto may buse, he Wsd he Wag
his wife did not do it; and, whent he afewrstold me he had been robbod, I told him I believed ittAo he. fse,, buLt said, "If thy find the things they wril put you a c yal r oath." Herev ped, "HoldIyod to fat lhothorto hlch thi and I'pi noe speak." .The -lastol tie I spoke toija I said, Supposoe yonr wife turi ond to-morrowand says you have done it?" He looked N'ery hard at me, and then said ('My wife never did deceive meo yet,-" and I said "cyeo' cannot tell that."
Mrs. Payne, the wife of the last witness, was called, and her testimony established the fact tha't the watch which the prisoner had alleged to have been tolen from his houh
with the other things, was i his rpossssion after thero covery of the murder, and was tho same that had been picked nupo ya chud not far from the scene of the murder dl ather sntnohe death of the children.
Mrs Harriet Munro, the daughter of the last witness, was caled, and deposed to having seon the womran whto had taken the ashes from under the fireplace at the house where the murder was committed throw a piece of cord in the fire.
Inspector Young informed the magistrate that these were all the witnesses he hadl in attendance, and the professional gentlemen engaged declining to offer any observations to the Bench,
Mr. ELLIOrT remanded the prisoners to a future day.

Vaccination And Smallpox.
VA CCIATION ANrD SMALLPOX.
TO THIE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-There are but few subjects of more practical importance to the public than vaccination. Now that yoa
ave broken ground by admitting the letter of the Rev. J. Hughes (The Ti nie, Febrary 10), I hope that the columns of The imes nwill be instrumental in removing a great deal of misconception and prejudice now existing in the public mind regardmg vaccination.
Mr. hughes means, I am sure, from the tenour of his letter, to state tho case fairly, but he is evidently not practically acquainted -with the subject he has undertaken to write upon. For instance, ho speaks of " failur in one instance when the operation had been apparently most successful by the ab3traction of matter from the pustule for the purpose of vaccinating other children." Now, abstracting matter (lymph) for the purpose of vaccinating other children has no influence whatever in tho protection afforded to the person vaccinated. The protection is from having excited the vaccine disease in the consticution, just as a person is protected from having once had smalipox, or measles, against theae complaints. Mr. Hughes means, I havo no doubt, that, notwithstanding this seemingly perfect vaccination, the child immediately suffered from smallpox. The reason was this,-the child had taken smallpox just before it was vaccinated. Smallpox requires 14 days for its developement-that is to say, 14 days after the disease is taken it appears on the skin, and there is usually 12 days' freedom from illness. The vaccine vesicle requires but seven days for its developement to be in perfection to vaccinate from, so that if a child bo vaccinated two or three days after it has taken smallpox, it may have good vaccine vesicles formed, fit to vaccinate from before the smalpox appears, and yet not be in the least protected by the vaccination. The vaccination requires a urther tae-the stage of areola-before any protection is afforded. Unless there has been time for the vaccination to run its course to the stag of areola, with out illness from smallpox, the smalleox withbejust as severe as if the person had never been vaccmated.
Vaccination may be relied on as having done its work as a preventive of smallpox when four or more vesicles have formed which have left good dotted cicatrices. The proportion of persons who take smallpox after vaccination to the numbers vaccinated is very small indeed, and of those who do take it, and have four or more cicatrices, a fatal termination does not occuroftenerthan once in200 attacks. This I know to be a fact, from having given great attention to the inquiry at this hospital for upwards of 20 years, and which I can prove, by having made a minute and careful investigation of all casem admitted at the hospital during that perred. edathhopalurg
I rent last year a petition to the Hons of Commous to pass the Vaccination Bill then before Parliament, a copy of vwhich I now encloee, and, as a similar biUl wiU most hkely be introduced thiB aeson, I should be gl it yon. would allow me more fully and deliberately tojive tke exprience of this hospital in a condensed form, fo. the guidance of the publicoin forming their judgment on this most important subject.

This case, by the desire of the parties interested, was heard in his Inour's private room on Monday and Tuesday; and at the conclusion of the arguments, shortly before 4 o'clockonthe latter day, his Honour reserved his decision until this rnorning. The decision, like the former pro;edings, was delivered in private; but it transpired that tleifollowing order was made:-Declare that the infant plaintiff, Alicia Race, ought to be brought up in the Protestant faith. Appoint Captain ConoUy and Mr. *Voodroffe (of the Chancery bar) gnardians of the infi.nt, if they think proper to accept the office. Otherwise, refer it to chambers to appoint fib and proper persons to be such guardians. Order that the infant plaintie, Alicia Race, be delivered up to the Sailors' Orphan School at Hampstead. The above order proceeding upon the undertaking of the lXev. E. U. Bickersteth and four other gentlemen, to clothe, maintain, and educate the child in a manner suitable to her rank, to an amount not exceeding 25g. per annum, until she should attain the age of 21 years.
Mr. Rally, Mr. Ellis, Mr. Iladdan, Mr. Bagshawe, and Mr. Bagshawe, jun., appeared for the several parties.
rAYOT V. FOUCnIER.
This was a motion for an injunction to restrain an action at law. It appeared that the defendant, Victor Fouchier
invented certain improvements in mils used for the grinding of flour. Felix Louis Bibas advanced money for the purpose of enabling Fouchier to work the invention, for which patents were obtained, and the plaintiff, Alfred Eayot, gave certain bills to Bihas, upon which Bibas brought an action, and the present bill was filed to restrain such action, on the ground that there was a partnership in the patents.
Mr. Glasse and Mr. Prendergast appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Baily and Mr. Chapman for the defendants.
Mr. GLASSE was heard in reply.
The VICE-CHMiCELLOR thought that the injunction ought not to be granted. It was not necessary to decide the question of partnership. The effect of what had taken place did not make Bibas a partner in -er se; but if he was a party asking for an injunction it must come at the earliest moment. The action was brought in November, and was to be tried this very day Upon the whole circumstances it was not a case for the interference of the Court, inamuch as there was not sufficient evidence of a partnership to affect the right to sue upon the bills in question.

rRICE'S PATENT CANDLE COMPANY (LIMITED) v. BAU-
EN1S'PATENT CANDLE COMPANY (LIMITED.)
The plaintiffs, who carried on business at Belmont, Vauxball, as Price's Patent Candle Company, and were establshed and incorporated by act of Parliament, had become possessed, under various assignments, of four several patents for iprovements in the manufacture of candles, and the nrghts and privileges thereby granted. The invention secured by the first of these patents in 1842 consisted, among other things, of admitting steam into a still by divided streams be ow the surface of fatty and oily matters and substances in course of distillation therein. The second patent, taken out in 1843,was for the invention of manufacturing candles from unpressed distilled fatty acids, produced by a process of saponification, and also of distilling fatt
and oily matters by the agencyof steam heatedabovethe temperature of the matters under distiUation, by meansof a fire placed at a distance from and not under the stiUl. The third patent, taken out in 1844, was for the distilation of fatty and oily acids, obtained from fatty or oily matters, previously treated by pressure or other suitable means, in order to extract the more liquid part thereof, and for the application to the manufacture of candles of the produce of such distillation, and for the using of distilled fatty acids in the manufacture of composite candles. The fourth paten', also taken out in 1844, consisted of a mode of treating products of the distillation of fatty and oily matters, for regulating the crystallization thereof, and of the application of the products so treated to the manufacture of candles. The defendants, the Banwens' Patent Candle Company, were incorporated and established by act of Parliament, and carried on the manufacture and sale of candles in Ranelagh-road, Pinmlico. The biU charged that the defendants bad for some time past, without leave and license from the plaintiffs, used and practised the several patent inventions of the plaintiffs in various processes connected with the manufacture of candles and oil, and the treatment and preparation of fatty and oily matters, in breach and violatien of their patent rights and privileges. To restrain the infringement of these several patents the bi had been filed, and an injunction was now moved for.
A vast quantity of evidence was adduced on either side, chi fly of a scientific character, as to the processes comprised in the specifications of the patents claimed by the plaintiffs, and on the other hand as to the processes employed by the defendants in their manufactory. Models were also produced in court of the stUg through which steam was admnitted in the course of distillation of the fatty and oily matters, &c. The nature of the evidence, and its voluminous character, renders it impossible to enter into detail upon the particulars of the case, which has occupied the Court for four days.
The Attorney-General, Mr. Bolt, Mr. Webster (of the common law bar), and Mr. Fooks appeared in support of the motion for an injunction; Mr. Cairns, Mr. Standish Motto, and Mr. Hobhouse, on behalf of the defendants, opoeoed the motion.
The main line of argument relied upon for the defence was that the patents claimed by the plaintiffs were void, upon the several grounds of want of novelty, too extensive and vague in specification, and inconsistency, and that, even assursuing the patents to be valid, there had been no infringement, either virtual or intentionaL, by the defendants, whose apparatus was different from that of the plaintiffs, and adapted for processes which were open for all the

SCHUS'IER AND OTIERS V. M%'KELLAR AN-D ANOTrIMR
Sir F. Thesiger, Mr. J. Wilde, QO-., and Mr. Blackburn appeared for the plaintiffs; and Mr. Bovill, Q.C., Mr. Cleasby, and Mr. Archibald for the defendants.
The plaintiffs in this action, }lessrs. Schuster and Co., were merchants inLondon, and the defendant, Mr. M'lellar, was a shipowner at Glasgow, the other defendant being the captain of the defendants ship Emperor. The action was brought to recover the sum of 1,2 0(., being the value of .50 tons of spelter shipped by the plaintiffs on board the defendant's ship the Emperor, to be taken to Calcutta, but whieh it was alleged the defendants had converted by improperly signing bills of lading to blessrs. Coles, Brothers.
It appeared that the plaintiffs had undertaken to purchase at Hamburg 250 tons of spelter on account of Coles. The goods were purchased, and 150 tons were shipped by Coles's orders to America, 50 tons were sent by one of Mr. Lindsay's ships to Bombay, and 50 tons were shipped on board the defendant's ship Emperor. The vessel was lying in St. Hatharine's Dock, London. The course of business betweeu the plaintiffs and Coles was this:-The plaintiffs handed a warrant for the delivery of the goods to the lighterman, who, having sipped the goods, too from the mate a rernate forthe goods and handed it to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs then kept the receipt until Coles paid for the goods. In this case the 50 tons of spelter were put on hoarcd on the 17th of way, as d the mate's recit f the same was feelivered by the gbgterman to the p1fnla`intif; but boles, without demanding the receipt, and withott paying for the goods, fraudulently procured bils of lading for the 50 tons of spelter to be siped by the captain. Coles having thus got the bills of lading, by means of their brokers, they, on the 3d of June, endorsed the same to the Oriental Bankc for value. The ship sailed on thel16th of June, but on the 24th of June Colas became bankrupt, and the plaintifrs then discovered that Coles had got the bills of lading without the pate's receipt. TheY then wrote to the defendaants, claiming the goods, and thse defendants replied that they (the plaintiffs) had mnade no appwlation for the bils of lading, and that the bills of lading bad been properly agned by the captain. Evidence was given, on the part of the plaintiff.
to show that, according to mercZtile usage, bills of ladingt ought not to be signed without the production of the sate's receipt, which ought to be attached to the blank bills.
The defence wasg that as the freight was engaged not by the plaintifis, but by Coles, the bir of ladvin

5'REEBODY V. WALLIS.
Mr. Knowles, Q.C.. and Mr. Cocskle appeared for the plaintiff; and Sir F. Thesigor and Mr. Hawkins for the def endant.
This was an aotion in which the plaintiff, Thomas Freebody, sought to recover damages from the defendant, Henry Wallis, for the breach of an agreement into which it was alleged the defendant had entered with the plaintiff, to sell him the plate and from 500 to 600 copies of an engraving called "The Scoffers," for the sum of 2501. The engraving was by HT. T. Ryell, and was taken from the painting by Rankley. The plaintiff was a commercial traveller, in the,erploy of Messrs. Agnewand Co., printsellers, at eanchester; and the defendant was an artist, who was in the habit of exhibiting pictures at Liverpool. According to the plaintiff's statement, in the month ot November last the defendant entered into an absolcte agreement, which was reduced to writing and signed, whereby he agreed to sell the plate and copies for the price named. The price was to be paid by instalments, 501. being paid down, and half the copies were to be delivered immediately. A day or two afterwards the defendant said he could not let the plaintiff have his prints, because the whole of them, together with the plate, had been sold to another party. The plaintiff was cross-examined to show that the agreement was entered into conditionally oe the defendant's bing able toXrocure the plate and prints, and that he was unable so to ;o but the plaintiff positively swore that there was an absolute sale of the goods, and that nothing whatever was said about any condition such as that referred to.
The defence was that the sale was conditional, and that it was agreed that the agreement which the defendant had signed should not take effect if the defendant should be unable to obtain the goods.
The jury found a vordict for the p]aintiff,-Damages, 1201.

JUSTICE and Common Juries.l
Mr. Robinson appeared for tho plaintiff, and Mfr. Dowdeswell for the defendant.
This was an action to recover the sum of 501., alleged to ba due from the defendant to the plaintiff for the services of the former, in obtaining, as a director to the Western Bank of London, a certain Major-General Bagnold. It may be remembered that at a former sittings of this Court, as reported in The Time, this cause was taken as undefended, but, at the suggestion of the presiding judge, Mr. Justice Wiles, was postponed, in order to give the defendant an opportunity of adding a plea which would raise the question of the legality of the transaction as disclosed. It appears that the defendant, who is a mining agent, was some time ago engaged in getting up a company for the formation of a bank, to be called " the Western Bank of London," and, according to the plaintiff's case, he promised him 501. for every director whom he should procure for such company. As JMr. Rankin was acquainted with Major-General Bagnold, the defendant suggested that that gentleman would be a very desirable acquisition, and accordingly the plaintiff called on the general in company with the defendant, and introduced the latter, who explained the scheme, and enlarged upon the advantages to be derived by any one who would give in his adherence to it. There was no doubt that eventually General Bagnold joined the bank and became, and is now, one of its directors; but the defendant, who on a former occasion had not appeared to defend, although he admitted that he was aware tbat the trial was to come on, now urged by way of defence-firstly, that he had never agreed to pay the plaintiff 501. for every director obtained, but that what he had said was that there would be a fund set apart for preliminary expenses, and that most hikely every one who did not get a place in the bank would be paid for his services, ard that lie believed every man who introduced a director would have 501. per man introduced ; secondly, that the plaintiff was not the ineais of bringing in General Baguold, but that he had been induced to become a director from the fact of the secretary of the bank having arranged that the 5001. qualification requisite for a director should be forthcorming in a manner convenient to the general; and, thirdly, that he (the defendant) and the plaintiff had entered into an illegal arrangement forthe purpose of bringing into the bank a director, concealing from him that the plaintiff was to have any reward, and representing that the plaintiff was not in. terested in the matter.
The case for the plaintiff being closed, and several letters having been put in from the defendant, in which he stated that the plaitiff had earned one 501., and mentioning a time for payment,
Mr. DownaS , S addressed the jury on behalf of the defendant, and called
- Pane.-I am the defendant. I was concerned with others m getting up the Western Bank of London. I knew Rankin, and said to him there would be a fund-I knew not what-outof which, if he succeeded in getting directors, there would be allowed 501. a-man. I suggested, as he knew General Bagnold, that he would be a desirable man to invite on the board. I only promised to pay him in that I way. We went together to call on General Bagnold. The
plaintiff introduced me, and impressed upon him that he was not interested. Be did not say he was to receive 501. General Bagnold attended a meeting. Afterwards he deelined to have any more to do with the bank, but eventually he became a director, and Mr. Bleckley, the secretary, finding the general objected to make any sacrifices, by way of realizing 5001. at that moment, to make up his qualification, undertook that Mr. Rymer, the solicitor to the company, should arrange matters as muost convenient. lUltimately the bank was established, and Major-General Bag. nold became, and is, one of the directors. The arrangement between myself and others engaged in the formation of the company was that whatever the sum set aside for the remuneration of parties who had had trouble was to be equally divided. A sum was set aside fec preliminary expenses. I got 3251. for one director introduced by me and for my serviceS.
Cross-examined by Mr. ROB3Nssox.-I reoeived 3251. I brought an action for 7501. I expected four times as much. I knew nothing of General Bagnold. The plaintiff intro. duced me. I worked for three months, but all I did was to get one director; but there is a great deal of gossiping about and work requisite before a bank is got up. General Banold's 501. was not allowed, though I tried to get it for the plaintiff. I knew this case was coming on at the last sittings. It had been previously postponed at my request.
Michael Bagnold.-I have known the plaintiff for four years. He introduced me to the defendant, but I went into the bank because my friends adyised it, and not because of Mr. Rankin's opinion -he gave none, and said he was not interested. I found my own qualification, and' did not make any arrangements with either Bleckley, Rymer, or any one else, about the requisite 5001.
Mr. DOWDESIVS3LL having summed up the evidence,
Mr. ROBLNSON addressed the jury in reply and said, that his learned friend had, by puttin such a plea as that pleaded on the record, alleged that his client was a great rogue. But happiy hie had failed in proving it. He then combated all the legal arguments advanced by Mlr. Dowdest well, and commented carefully upon the facts as they were proved, and as they were applicable to each issue, and concluded by saying that had it not been for the almost un. precedented course taken, but of which he dared not com. plain, by the learned judge before whom this case originally came, his client would now be enjoying the benefit, if not the real fruits, of a verdict in his favour.
The learned JUDGE having gone through the evidence at Eome length,
The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff.
Mr. DownsvxELL requested the learned judge to direct them to give a special verdict on the plea of fraud.
At the request of Mr. RonINsoN the plea was read to the jury, and they said, " We find everything for the plaintiff," one of the,ury observing, " Such things we know are

On adjourning the Court,
'T'he Cnuw BBxnoN said that he regrettel to be obliged to take that step at so early an hour, but it was impossible for the Court in its present incomplete condition to proceed any further to-day with the BessCO business. The want of the full complement of judges had already compelled him to leave two or three special jury causes untried in Middlesex, and he feared that similar results must follow in the city if th,e appointment of a jadge in the place of the late Ir.

CAWVKWELL V. DAY.
Mr. M. Chambers and Mr. Pollock appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Edwin James and Mr. Daley for the wefenKAn.
It appeared from the plaintiff's case that he had advanced 1(01. to the defendant as a premium for a patent which the latter represented he had taken out for the purpose of manufacturing " patent Chinese firelighters." HLe had laid out 401. in mating the article, but it then turned out that the defendant had no patent for the article. This action had therefore been brought to recover the sum of 1401., the amount which the plaintiff had lost by the conduct of the defendant.
The defence was that the defendant had never represented that he had a paetnt for the manufacture, but
Mr. Baron ILtRTiN said that the agreement between the parties showed that the defendant had represented himself as having a patent, which he undertook to transfer to the
plaintiff. ~ ~ ~ e lanif fr h The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for the
amount claimed.
cnmIQ v. REILLY.
Mr. Seijeant Thomas appeared for the plaintiff; and Mr. Edwin James for the defendant.
This was an action brought for an assault and false imprisonment. The defendant pleaded "'Not guiltv."
It appeared from the plaintiff's statement that at the time the alleged assault was committed he was a shopman in the employment of the defendant, who was a gunmaker in New Oxford-street. A gentleman having purchased a rifle from the defendant, the plaintiff was instructed to carry it to the purchaser's house. He found, however, that there was no buUet-mould among the other apparatus, and he acoordingly took one, and on delivering the articles he demanded 2s. 6d. as the price of the buUet-mould. He was paid that sum, and the next morning he entered the amount as received in the daybook. Three days afterwards his master came up to him with a policeman and gave him into custody for embezzling the money. He was taken first to the police-station in George-street, St. Giles's, then to Guildball, then to Smithfield,. and finaUy he was brought back to George-street, when he was liberated on hail. The next morning he went before the magistrate, and he was discharged, the defendant not appearing to support the charge. The inspector who took the charge said that on the matter being fully explained to him he told the defendant that if he had communicated
to him the whole circumstance at first he would have saved all parties a great deal of trouble, for he should most certainly not nave taken the charge. The occurrence took place in January, 1S56, and the plaintif had in consequence been out of employment ever since.
Mr. EDWVrI JAMES, in addressing the jury for the defendant, said that there were a great many people who instructed counsel and then refused to act by their advice. As the defendant persisted, contrary to his advice, in etting into the witness-box, he should call himu and leave him to tell his own tale.
The defendant, on being called, said that he had expressly told the plaintiff that he was not to ask for any money when he delivered the gun, as it had been paid for. fle believed a bullet-mould had also been paid for .nd sent by the plaintiff. The plaintiff had had time to alter the books and enter the 2s. Gd. before he was given into custody.
Mr. Baron MARTIN, in sunmming up, said it woald be a great advantage to persons if they would leave their 'case entirel in the hands of their counsel, who knew how to manage it much better than they did. The verdict in this ease must be for the plaintiff, and the jury must say to what damages they considered him entitled.
The jury immediately returned a verdict for the plaintiff -Damages 701.

Consistory Court, Wednesday, Feb. 11.
CONSISTORY COuRT. WI.'n-fPqnlAV 11
HARMAR V. TTARATAP
(1Before Dr. LusHN-GToz.-
this was a cause of divorce, by reason of crnelty, promoted by Mrs. Lucy Harmar against her husband, Mr. David James Harmar. The Court awarded Mrs. Harmar 125. per annum pendenee lile, and after hearing the cause and granting her prayer, decreed her permanent alimony at the rate of 1601. per annum. An act on petition was now given in on the part of Mr. Harmar, in which it was alleged that the alimony as it became due had from time to time been paid, notwithstanding which Mrs. Harmar had incurred very heavy debts since the day from which her receipt of alimony commenced, which he had been compeUed to pay in consequence of legal proceedings having been taken against him. Those debts amounted to 1611. Is. Gd., andit was submitted that he was entitled to deduct that sum from any alimony which might otherwise be due to his wife. Of the above amount 1171. 4s. Id. consisted of the bil of Messrs. Dale, at whose hotel Mrs. iarmar, on her final separation from her husband, went to reside. In the answer to the act given in on behalf of Mir. Harmar it was stated that on previous occasions she had gone to the same hotel to escape prom the violence of her husband, who had always paid the expenses which she had incurred; that on being informed that alimony pcendnte lite had been allotted her she removed from the hotel, and had ever since supported herself out of that alimony; that it was only after the issuing of monitions that she obtained the alhmony due to her pcndente lite; and that there was now owing to her the permanent alimony due since the sentence of divorce was pronounced.
Dr. Addams and Dr. Twiss appeared for the husband; Dr. Bayford and Dr. Spinks for the wife.
The learned JtmDE said it was alleged that the alimony, not specifying whether pendente lite or permanent, had been paid as it became due. The first inquiry was whether that fact was true. As to alimony pendente lite, the averment was clearly contrary to the truth. The averments in the answer to the act on the part of the wife were not controverted, and the result was that, so far from the alimony being paid when due, it was only obtained after much delay and frequent application to the Court. He was somewhat surprised that under such circumstances so erroneous a statement, if it referred to alimony pendente lite, should have found its way into these pleadings. With respect to permanent alimony, nothing whatever had been paid; and therefore the allegation was, to use an expression scarcely sufficiently strong, wholly erroneous. Under those circumstances, not certainly the most unsuspicious, the Court was asked to stop the payment of permanent alimony by deducting from it certain debts incurred before alimony pendente tle was decreed. lie believed the application to be entirely novel. In "Brisco v. Brisco," 2 Con. Rep., Lady Brisco had incurred very large debts, for which her husband was made responsible, and that for the purpose of putting him to expense. There the application was made before almony was alotted, and the Court very properly took the misconduct of the wife into consideration in allotting the amount of alimony pendente lite. This, however, was a very different case. Here the Court was asked to deduct from permanent alimony expenses incurred by the wife principally on account of her maintenance from the period of separation up to the allotment of alimony, which, if duly paid, would exempt the husband from responsibility. It was not alleged that during that period the husband furnished the wife with any means of subsistence whatever, and it was now established by the decree of the Court that by reason of his cruelty the wife was justified in separating herself from him. He would not enter into a consideration of whether the expenses of the hotel were extravagant or not. The whole fault lay at the door of the husband, who compeUed her to leave his house and left her without the means of subsistence, and so situated it might be difficult for her to get credit and lve economically. But be that aS it might, the application was altogether too late, and such a deduction from permanent alimony would be without precedent; and as many such cases must defacto have occurred, and no such application had been made, it was unwarranted by the practice of the Court. Permanent alimony had been long due, and a monition therefore mnst issue immediately for its payment.

The bankrupts were canvas merohants of Bow-lane.
Mr. Jones (tobacconist) opposed their application for certificates.
Mr. L;iW-URCE supported, and contended that the oppo. sition came with an ill grace from hr. Jones, whom the ban1krts had aided in accommodation bill transactions.
HiS HONOUR said, the ecific opposition of Mr. Jones had failed. The case was, however, not a meritorions one. There were debts to the amount of 4,0001., and the estate would not pay ls. in the pound. The bankrupts' accounts commenced With a deficiency, although of but small amount. Every trader was bound to know when he was in a deficiency, and, knowing it, to be very circumspect. T'he bank. rnpts' trade expenses had exceeded their profits, and their personal expenses had come out of the pockets of their creditors. Accommodation bill transactions could never be noticed without reprobation, and the bankrupts would only receive third-class certificates, after three months' suspen. Sion, with protection.

Scforc Mr. PASLEY, Q.C., Assstant-Judge.)
Ienry Kent, a lighterman, surrendered in court to taUe his trial on a charge of having stolen 1801b. of Cavendis-h tobacco, the property of John William Dean, his master; and John Pearson, dealer, was indicted for feloniouslv receiving the same knowing it to have been stolen.
Mr. Motealfe appeared for the prosecution; Mr. Horry defended Pearson; Kent was not defended.
On the 26th of December the prosecutor, a master lighter. man, at 12, G- eat Water-lane, gave the prisoner Kent an order for the deHvery to him of 28 boxes of Cavendish tobacco from the London Docks, with instructions to take them forthwith to a Liverpool steamer called the Laurie, then lying in the river, at such a distance from the decks as would have enabled him to reach her in about half-anhour after he had received the boxes. He did not, however, go to the steamer until the followinmorning, allging as the reason that he had lost the tide on the preceding day, and when the number of boxes shipped was compared with the order one was misaing. The officer of the steamer at once called the prisoner's attention to that circumstance, when he exclaimed that he was done for, and said the box which was absent must have been stolen from his barge while he wras temporarily absent from it. Evidence was given that before proceeding to the docks Kent solicited a person named Connoway to join with him in a tobacco job to put 3Z. or 41. in his pocket, but he refused, saying he
his hving honestly. The prisoner signed the receipt or the boxes in the name of Johnson. It was shown that the prisoner Pearson had been endeavouring to sell tobacco answering the description of that stolen, and when he was taken some fragments of Cavendish were found in his pockets-some on a knife, and on an axe which he had in hi possession. A witness who gave important evidence when the case was before the magistrate was not now in attendance, having gone to Hlolland.
jh ury found both prisoners GuiTh,. NSothing wa
knovaetrnmental to Pearsoa's character, but Inspector
idges, Thames police, proved that Kent had been for a long time associated with "river thieves," and concerned in some extensive robberies.
Sentence was deferred.

Mr. Metealfe and Mr. Orridge appeared for the prosecuo ion; Mr. Sleigh defended Eagleston.
The jury found both prisoners Guilty. Sentence deferred.
Henry Burrows, 30, Elizabeth Burrows, 27, and John Henry Brown, 15, were indicted on Tuesday for having stolen four silver tablespoons and other articles, the property of Edward Miles, in his dwelDinhousc
The prosecutor resides in Park-road, Dalaton, and on the 25th of January a basket of plate was missed from one of
his bedrooms. The same night Clark, 220 N, and another constable, named Cowen, went to a house, No. 3, Devonshire-place, Shoreditch, where they found the prisoners in a room, and, upon information they had received, took them all three into custody. On looking round the room the last-named officer noticed that one of the flooring boards lad been raised and not properlyt astened down, and on pulling it up he found a parcel underneath, which contained sod e of the stolen dslver spoons broken up. Burrows admitted that he and the lad did the robbery, and said the wonan knew nothing about it. She lived with him aS his wofe.
A lad namred Woioiand C ockett said he lived sith his father, a jeweller, at No. 2, Sewardstreet, Goswelhistreet. On the day of this robbery the prisoner Brown came to him, and said he wanted to see him down at a coffeehouse in John's-road, and accordingly he met him there at 6ro cloc . He asked him then to sell some spoons for him, which he agreed to do, and they went cto M-. Reeves, a refmner in Goswell-street, where witness was known, having been in the habit of going there on errauds for his father. Mr Reeves melted the spoons down into a bar, and then wetghed it. It came to wr Os. 6d., at 4s. td. per ounce. Brown was waiting outside. When he got the money he returned with Brown to the coffeehouse, where Borrowe
was waiting for them. The money was given to him, and witness wvas rew arded with 3s. He admitted that he suspected somehing whas wrong in the matter. Some of the spoons were like some now produced, those found under the floor at Burrows's. The spoons which he took to the refmer'swere broken whe he received them from Brown, and he told MIr. Reeves that he wanted them melted for his lather. He had been on such errands before.
MIr. Reeves deposed that the last witness brought him some broken spoons, saying hecame from his father, and he melted them ashe requested. He had known the boy and his father for years. When melted the spoons weighed .air ,adnwt and he gave 4s. 9d. per ounce, which was a
farprice.
The AssIrsTAW-JunGE said refiners should be very cau-
tious how they purchased broken up spoons from boys, or: they would stand a good chance of being indicted ; but in this case the refiner was acquainted with the boy and his
father, and had done business for him as a jeweller, which, 1 of course, led him not to suspect anything wrong.
The defence was this-that Brown met a stranger near Bow-bridge, who askIed him if he could sell some spoons. Knowing Crockett, and that he used to go to Reeves's, he said he could, and went in search of him. The spoons were
-sold, and theymetBurrows by accident, and he (Brown) i asked him to hold the money until he met the man at an I appointed place close by, as he was afraid of losing it. They saw the man and gave him the money. He then gave him a parcel to holdwhile he went down the street for a minute, but, as he did not return, he went to Burrows's, where he lodged, and finding more spoons in the parcel he was afraid he might be taken up, so he forced a board in the floor and concealed the parcel there, and neither Burrows nor his wife knew anything about it.
The jury found the woman IVot Guilty, and the others! Guilty.
The AssIsTA'r-JuQDGE sentenced Burrows to 12, and Brown to four months' hard labour.
The policeman produced two bars of silver, and asked the Court what he was to do with them. One was admitted to be the produce of the spoons; Mr. Reeves said the other was not, but the weight of the two corresponded to the weight of the missing articles.
Mr. Reeves said one only was the produce of Mr. Mills's property.
The ASSTsN-T-JUDGE said he had better leave it where it was, and the police had better give them both to Mr. Mills. If Mr. Reeves was dissatisfied he could bring his action.

Mr. Edgar Shaw Blaker, of 12, Warwick-court, Holborn, and r. Charles Mtchenson, of the CoUege, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, medical students, appeared on bail, having been, escorted to the court by about 100 of their fraternity belonging to the same establishment, to answer a charge of assaulting WiUiam Wickenden, by cutting open his head with a stick loaded with lead.
From the complainant's statement it appeared that he wastanghome hisfriend Benson, who, being Bacchiplenus,
.as unable to taLce care of himself, when he was met in Bartholomew-close by the defendants, wbso were walking in a swaggering manner as if for the purpose of clearing all before them off the path. Re remonstrated with them and received in replya blow upon his head from a life preserver delivered with great force by the defendant Blaker. He bled verymuch from the wound, and was obliged to go to the hospital to get his head dressed. He secured the weapon in t e stru?gle, and produced a flexible stick, loaded at the head with led, which certainly rendered it a formidable instrument for offence or defence. The defendants afterwards went with a policeman to his house, and upon their charging him with stealing the weapon described he gave them into custody for the assault. Mitchenson did nothing actively to injure him.
In explanation of his conduct Blaker said he was walking ,ith Mitchenson wben the complainant and his friend Benson met them. The complainant offered to toss them for quarterns of gin, and upon their declining this invita.ion sml.. proceeding onward they were folowed by the complainait and his friend, who laughed at the defendants, and alatinately the complainant took hold of Blaker by the arm, and insisted upon his having some gin. He shook him off, and while doing so Benson came behind him. The defendants retreated towards the hospital gates, when the other two folowed, and complainant struck at Blaker, and broke bis hat with the blow. Blaker thereupon struck at complainant's hat with his stick, but unfortunately hit his head instead, and thereby caused the injury complained of.
This statement was in a great measure corroborated by Mr. Fox, the ward beadle of Castle Baynard, who also stated that there was a third man with complainant and his friend Benson, and they were all drunk. The defendants were perfectly sober.
Alderman CuBsM said he was prepared to believe the complainant was intoxicated, and had molested the defendants to some extent, but Blaker was not justified in using the weapon with which he was armed as he appeared to have done. The worst part of the case was the act of Blaker carrying such a weapon about with him; for it indicated one of two thing-either that he was in the habit of going into places and company where violence might be apprehended, or that he armed himself for the purpose of mischief. Takin all the circumstances into consideration, he could not dispose of the case without the infliction of a fine. He therefore fined Blaker 20s. * but with regard to Mitchenson the evidence did not impficate him dm e assault, and the charge against him was dismissed.
The fine was paid, and the defendante left the court with their fellow-students, who set up a shout of triumph, by way of congratulation, on arriving in the yard in front of GuildhalL

Mr. BxADON said le could come to no other conclusion than that Thorpe wasthe occupier of the room, and that it was open on the day in question for betting Purposes The case was analogous to that of Ray, who had been previously convicted, and he should therefore inflict a similar fLne-o01., or four months' imprisonment.

WOysEaPsn ETr.-Mr. John Walker, a haberdasher in ShAftosbury -4m Now North-road, was charged at tho
instance of the parish authorities of Snoreditch with the following cruelty to his niece, Elzabeth Brockmea, an mphan child, 8 years of age.
hleadows, the beadle, stated,- Having received informa. tion as to the defendant's treatment of this child, I on the 2Uth ult, went to his house, aecompanied by Wailer, the other beadle, and told him we heard that he iWtreated the child, and kept her in an underground wasbhouse, although he received an allowance from our parish to assist in keeping her and her brother, 6 years old. We had no charge to make about the boy, but we wished to see the girl, and he offered to fetch her. We objected, and went with him down to a back washbouse, six feet under.
round, the door of which was buttoned on the outside. When we got in the girl was standing in a corner, cold, shivering, and dejected, with a copper and sink in the place, but no fire or fireplace. Oa the floor was a red earthenware pan, similar to what gardenpots are stood in, with a wooden spoon, and the child told me she had her bread and water given her in that pan, sometimes sopped bread with the tealeaves thrown over it, Defendant said the child was to clean the things there, and that if she did not do them in time she had to stay there tiUl they were done. The girl had on a large pair of old blucher boots, apparently an old pair of the defendant's, and a pair of socks on,which seemed to have eaten her feet into sores. She has been in our infirmair ever since, and the boy's feet also appear to be
very bad. I asked to see the child's bedroom, and again defendant wanted to go first I went with him to a sort of lumber-cupboard, lit by one pane of glass, and there found a flock bed and a very thin canvass sort of stuff. I asked for the bed-covering, and he said the child was so filthy in her habits he could not let her have any, and on examining the tick of the bed I found it dirty. The child told me she had been kept in that washhouse from 8 o'clock in the morning till 4 in the afternoon, and that it was usnal for her to
so kept Defendant said she was a thief,and he could not let her be in the shop or parlour. Although he receives an allowance from the parish, his own means are good, the stock in the shop being worth 3u01., at Iast; I told him that and ho did not deny it; besides which he is the leaseholder of that house and one opposite, and likewise kolds a situation in the city.
Defendant.-You left behind you aU the warm covering in the girl'som
Meadows.-I am quite sure there was no ot'ner than what I have mentioned.
Elizabeth Hart.-I nursed the defendant's wife in her conhnement, and left on Saturday fortnight. I know this child, and have seen the defendant boat her most shamefully, I have seen him strike her with a large piece of wood upon the head. Once I found her face very much bruised, and die told me the defendant had done it with a broom. On another occasion he told me himself that he had stripped her naked, laid her on the floor, and beaten her with a cane tiU she was nearly dead; he added, "Indeed, I thought that she was dead." On leaving the washhouse at 4 o'clock she was sent up to her little room, and would huddle herself up ist a corner. I have frequently had words with him about the children, but never about anything else, nor with his wife. On going away I told hini I would inform the parish, and he saidI could not hurt him. The child had not nearly sufficient either to eat or clothe her. She had bread and water in the dish
erduced, with a wooden spoon, at breakfast in the washoase, for dinner three potatoes and a piece of bread, and once or twice a-week he would her give her about an ounce of stale meat he might find in the safe. She had no drink at her dinner, and for tea she had bread and water ngain, or bread with the refase of the teapot thrown over it. She often asked me for a little bread, but I durst not give it her, and sometimes, when I had an opportunity, I took her to the parlour fire for warmth; but if defendant came in he sent her back immediately. She used to fly from him at all times. A little black frock, two petticoats, one of them a baby's, made by her mother, I believe, just before her death, and a pinafore, were all her dress. His general conduct to her was crael in the extreme; in the middle of the night he would go into her room, pull her out of bed, and leave her in the dark to get back how she could. She used to pull her clothes over her feet, to get warmth in them. She is a very clean child, and a good one. She is also so beautiful a needlewoman that the defendant told me she would be worth 10s. a-week to him.
Defendant.-It is of no use asking this woman any questions; she will say anything.
Mr. D'ETNcouRT.-If her statement is true, your conduct has been most brutaL.
Waller.-I produce this part of a wooden measure, which I found in the house1 and the child told mne the defendant had broken it by striking her upon the head with it.
Mr. D'EYmCOURT (to defendant).-I shall remand you for a week, but will accept two sureties in 301. each, and yourself in 601., for your future appearance ; and in the meantime (to the parsh officers), as the child is said to be very intelligent, let her be properly instructed as to the nature of an oath against the next examination.
Both children, who were in court, had their feet swathed in bandages; and the girl's large full eyes became fearful
shrinhrng whenever they met those of the defendant.
SoluTrwAvRK.-John Harris and Edward Dungate, two powerful-looking felows, were brought before Mr. CONUE, charged with breaking into the dwellinghonse of James Clar and stealing therefrom wearing apparel and money of the value of 401. They also broke into two other houses in their endesvour to escape from the officers.
Mr Clark stated that she and her husband resided at 2, Earl-street, London-road, where also 3r. Beans, a cornImerchant, had apartments. On the previous evemng, about
6 o'clock, witness 1eft the house perfectly safe, and on her return home at 8 o'clock she saw her husband at the door
which they iound Impossible to open. Her husband, however, ained adission, when she perceived a chest of drawers had been forced open and emptied of the contents, consisting of three coats, three pairs of trousers, three waistcoats, three silk handkerchiefs, a silk dress, and a potticoat belonging to her husband. In the adjoining room she minsed eight pairs of trousers, two coats, 12 shirts, and five waistcoats, belonging to Mr. Robert Beans. In the back parlour she missed a shirt which she had left drying by the fire, two as. packets of copper money, and aome silver from a table. She valued her husband's property at 121, and Mr. Beans's property at 201.
Mr. James Clark said that, finding he could not gain admission into his house by the front door, lie went round to the back, with a constable, and found the backdoor open, andsaw two men, whom he believed to be the prisoners climbing on a publichouse two doors off. VWitness entered his house and saw a bundle containing all theoproperty described by his wife lying in the passage. Witness also saw his c asbox, broken open and emptied of IL 17s., lying on the floor. All the property was safe in the house when he left in the afternoon.
Ann Hartley, living opposite the prosecutor's, said that a little before 8 o'clock on the previons evening she saw three men standing at Mr. Clark's door. Two of them, whom she recognized as the prisoners, opened the door and entered while the third remained outside. She heard the door boited, and suspecting theywere thieves she went after a constable, when the third man ran away.
Mr. Henry Green, hosier, 115, London-road, whose back preiies adjoin the prosecutor's, said that about 8 o'clock he beard a noise in the passage of his house, and on proceeding to see what was the matter he perceived Harris crouching in a corner. He caught hold of him, and hearing a noise upstairs, he handed him over to a friend while he went towards the top of the house, when he heard a smash on the roof. A constable caine up after him and went on the roof and a few minutes afterwards the other prisoner was captured. They had broken into the house by the roof, and would, no doubt, have escaped by his front door had he not heard the noise in the passage.
Charles Carpenter, police-constable 134 L, said he was called by last witness, when he saw Harris in custody in the passage. He then ascended the roof and captured the prisoner in the adjoining house, after he had fallen through a ceiling of one of the rooms. Witness, with Sergeant Smith, 4 M, examined Mr. Clark's front door, and found it had been forced open, as there were marks on the doorpost. The bundle wasalso picked up, and the contents examined by Mrs. Clark, who identified all the property.
Mr. CosMBE asked what was known of the prisoners.
Sergeant Smith replied that they were connected with a desperate gang of hosebreakers, but lie was not aware whether they had been convicted.
Theprisoners, after being cautioned in tho usual way, said they should reserve their defence, when

RItMARKS.
During the present week the cold has been much more intense in some localities than in others. Belvoir Castle is the most interesting station. Standing on the summit of a hil clothed with trees, it has quite a climate of its own, as may be seen by a comparison with Grautham; indeed, the climate is so different that it would be very desirable to establish meteoroloWical stations in the immediate neigh. bourhood. The stle-terrace, Kni ton, and Bottesford appear to be the most desirable localties. These stationg would point out another feature-viz., the effect on the amount of rain, which would be very different between the Castle and Bottesford. The amount of rain fallen durin
the week has been very different in different parts of England.

The 34th (York and Lancaster) Regiment, now stationed 'at Rangoon, it is expected, will be removed to CbIna during the present summer, to be in readiness for '.ny military vperstions in coatemplation.
Parties from the 2d and 3d Dragoon Guards, Royal Dragoons, and 17th Lancers, embarked, on Tuesday at Dnblin, In charge of 58 horses for the military train now in the course of formation at York. The Major'Geral commanding the cavalry and Staff attended the 'smbarcation.
Her Majesty's ship Diamond, 27, Captain C. B. Hamilton jlcS55), arrived atChathams on 'euesday evening from the Mfediterranean, having been teeved from the Nore by the African stAmer, where she was previously inspected by Captain E. P. Halstead. Sbo has been ia commission three -years, during which tiffe sbe has been employed p-incipaly
in the lediterranean. 'She will be dismasted aan paid off.
The Dragon, 6 gxzns, pnddlewheel steam frigate, Captain William R. Sten7art, C.B., is ordered to be tbken into the basin at Sheeress to-morrow, preparatory to her being paid off. Captain Lord Frederick Kerr, in command of the flagpfaip Waterloo, on inspecting the Dragon, passed high 'encomiums on the high state of gunnery, discipline, &c., manifested by the officers and crew.
The Hawke, '60 guns, screw steamship, Captain James Wilcox, atSheerness, is ordered to the Nore to-day; thence she proceeds to Portsmouth to complete her complement, and she will 'then go direct to her station on the coast of Ireland.
The Pembroke, 60 guns, screw steamship, Captain John Fraser, isander orders to lesve Sheerness this day direct 'for Leith.
The iron screw steam troopship Megaera, Commander iaurvis, which sailed from Plymouth on Sunday with detachments for the Cape of Gooed Hope and the Mauritius, vput baok on Tuesday morning, having sustained consider -able damage in the gale of Sunday night and Monday. The troops have been placed ou board the Vigo hulk in Hamoaze, and the ship is appointed to go into dock at Keyham this day (Thursday) for repair.
Yesterday morning a general inspection of the Royal =Artillery battalions took place at Woolwich under the superintendence of Colonel Palliser, and LieutenantColonel Bingham, Assistant-Adjutants-General. The men were drawn up in separate detachments at head-quarters in the Gymnasium and the several squares of the establishment. The object of the inspection was to note down the names of all those who may be considered unfit for dtty, all below the required height, and those of marked or doubtful character, and whom it may be sonsidered advisable to dismiss, in order to meet the regulations recently issued for the discharge of 1,100 men, and thereby deprive the service of as few good men as possible. A medical board is in close attendance to examine and attest each man noted down for discharge. The dismissals ordered by the Commander-in-Chief from the Royal Artillery alone are to the above amount, independently of the ordinary reduction of about G0 per raonth, which occur in consequence of siclness and crime. Fiveof the senior quarternasters are to be permitted to retire on fuU pay, anti are to receive the honorary titles of captains in the corps. Some of these veteran soldiers have aoeaired that boon by faithful services of upwards of half a century in the regimnent.
The labours of the Royal Arsenal at Woolwieh have again assumed a warlike appearance. The pyramids of shot and shell are being removed and roUled towards the wharfs, which are again covered with guns, waggons, cases 'of shot, &c., whence they are coaveyed in barges to St. Katherine's Docks, for shipment to China, while the North fleet freight. ship atthe Arsenal pier is engaged in embarking a heavy cargo of war steres of every description, which by means of the hydraulic cranes ure shipped with extraordinary expedition and small amount of labour.

(FROM ou:n owx corREErONDF.rT.)
DUBLIN, WEDNESDAY MORNNG.| THE ELECTIONS.
The vacarwy in the representation of Tipperary about to be created by the expulsion of Mr. James Sadleir from the House of Commons will probably lead to a severe contest, although as yet the only candidate in print is Mr. W. H. Massey, chairman of the Waterford and Limerick Railway. The Hon. Mr. George O(Callaghan has just issued an address in which lhe announces that circumstances over -whieh he had -no control preverLt him from -offering his services to the electors on the present occasion. The hon. gentleman, it appears, is compelled to take -this step in consequence of the precarious health of his father, the *venerable Lord ;isrmore, who is now in the-82d year of his age.
ESCUHJERED ESTATES COURtT.
The Irish Chief Secretary having admitted that the experiment of reducing the ntunber of commis-sioners had proved a failure, the lhibtin Emning Post calls on the Government to disregard in future any attempt by clamour in the House of Commons to weaken the efficiency of the Court, or to lessenI -the high reputation it had acquired by years of hard labour and juidicious conduct as a model tribunal
for the sale and transfer of landl. The Post does not I ~exaggerate when it states that it is now become the universal opinion that the Encumbered Estates
Court ought to be made a permanent tribuual.| There are, it is believed, three candidates for the -third commissionership, whose claims are under the consideration of the Government. The first and most popular name on the list is Mr. Woulfe Flanagan, the present Master of the couirt, and -who for soms years filled the post of secreAary. The second candidate is an able real pro:perty lawyer, though not as well known in the Court of Equity, where his practice lies, as *he had been at the earlier period of his professional career. The third, according to the Freemen's Journal, is a a lawyer and M.P., quite adequate to judicial duties in any court. Sales of property were effected yesterday to -the amount of about 34,0001.

Promotion From The Ranks.
-P1OMOTION FROM THE RANKS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-As the Army Estimates will soon be brought befor3 the House, I trust you will permit me to lay befowe you a brief statement, illustrative of the manner in whicb. our " system" sometimes works, when, by its action, deserving non-commissioned officers are "rewarded" by promotion to commissions, and Isincerely hope that it aay succeed in drawing public attention to the consideration of the question.
During the war a very large numEer of non-commissioned officers were appointed to cornetcies and lieutenancies in the newly-raised Land Transport Corps, to reward them for distinguished gallantry or for long service, and by their zeal, diligence, and hard work the battalions of raw levies of which that corps was composed were brought in a short time to a state of the very highest efficiency.
The Land Transport Corps has recently been disbanded. In lieu of it a regiment ealled "the Military Train" has been organIzed, and, although the officers have not yet been nominated, it is understood that a large proportion of the officers of the disbanded Land Transport Corps have been offered lieuteuancies and ensigueies in the Military Train. Now, it is for the position of these officers I demand your consideration. By Her Majesty's regulations a grant is made to each non-commissioned officer promoted to a commission of the sum of 16Ol. if in the cavalry, and of 1001. if in the infantry, in orderthat he may obtain au outfit and meet the expenses consequent on what may well be called a change of condition. The latter sum was, in most cases, given to the sergeants who received commissions in the Land Transport Corps, although it was a mounted regiment, and in every case it was found barely sufficient for the most meagre outfit.
But now those able, deserving, and meritorious officers are calied on, in case they take commissions in the Military Train, to provide themselves with a new and expensive uniform and new accoutrements,without receiving a farthing from Govemment to assist them in the purchase. How, Sir, is it possible for these officers, ot of an income of 5s. 3d. a-day, to pay nearly 1001. for their new outfit, and to maintain themselves in " the positioc of gentlemen," to which they have been so unfortunately and crnelly advanced ?
In addition to this outlay they will have to pay mess subscription, stamp on commission, &c., au out of their daily pay, for these men belong to a class which neither possesses ready money nor the means of obtaining it.
It may be said they can reject the appointment. But wlat wiU become of them ?-they are soldiers who have "refased a chance," and every one familiar wvith Horse Guards' practice knows what that means. They are fit for nothing but soldiering, and, if they were fit for anything else, that is just the thing they woald not get, and the country would besides lose the services of experienced and zealous men in a branch of the army where experience and zeal are especially valuable. Well may these officers rue the day when their gallantry in the field or meritorious conduct brought them into notice, and recommended them to a " promotion" fraught with such disastrous consequences. As sergeant-majors or sergeants they would have been not only free from debt, but independent, according to their station in life, and have had the certainty of a retirement on half-pay, which would not be incompatible with their engaging in situations for which their previous habits and position fitted them.
There axe, I can assure you, Sir, " ofiicers" of the late Land Transport Corps who, as non-commissioned officers, fought at the Alma, Inkermann, the IRedan, and in the trenches, and whose ambition is to obtain employment almost menial on railways and in the service of public companies! Is this the reward a soi-disant grateful country gives those gallant men who were the back-bone of the army in the Crimea ? Promotion from the ranks, as our system stands, is a curse and not a blessing to the deserving soldier. In
most cases it leads to unhappiness-in many to loss of character and self-respect. To make it a boon to the soldier -to him who is indeed a true soldier-the country must make up its mind to accompany promotion with a considerate and liberal allowance, and I trust that some method of depriving this " reward" of its bitter sting will be devised by the excellent, hard-working, and zealous soldier's friend, who seems emulous of his Royal relative's fame in the discharge of the administration of the army.
Your obedient humble servant.

TO ME- EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-On the 17th inst. Sir J. Fergusson is to call attention in the House of Commons to the position of non-comnmissioned officers promoted to commissions during the war. Will you kindly allow me space in your widely-circulating columns to supply the hon. baronet, and the public generally, with a few facts on this important subject?
The Land Transport Corps is about to be reduced, and the Military Train organized in its stead. There are 14 captains in the former corps, 12 of whom are from the ranks; 13 have been offered the r ank of lieutenant and one that of quartermaster in the latter corps, while two lieutenant. colonels, four majors, aud all the captains are to be brought from other corps and the half-pay list; indeed, four of the proposed captains are holding only the rank of lieutenant, Two majors and four captains, it appears, have served with the Land Transport Corps, although not holding commissions in the corps, as also two of the lieutenants who are to be appointed captains; but upon what principle the other two of these four lieu tenants are brought in to serve over the 14 officers already holding the rank of captain, aud who are offered the rank of lieutenant or quartermaster, is a mystery-a proceeding without warrant or precedent.
The lieutenants of the Land Transport Corps are nearly all to be swept away, and among those to be gazetted as lieutenants to the Military Train are four who have never held Her Majesty's commission, and have never ssived with the Land Transport Corps. When the Osmanli Artillery was being organized in the East an offer was made to the sergeants of the Royal Artillery to fill the rank of lieutenant in that corps; several were gazetted to do duty as lieutenants, but did not receive commissions. The war over, they were ordered to revert to their former rank as sergants of artillery; now, I contend that these men had nothn}g to complain of, because they were fully aware of the terms upon which they were about to enter the Osmanli Artillery; at least, it was known to every sergeant of the regiment at Woolwich, and I presume that it was made known to the sergeants of the regiment serving in the Crimea also, where three of these men were serving at the time, the other being at home; however, I believe a powerful appeal was made to the authorities on the subjeot, and they were allowed to retire on a pension of 3s. per diem. Four of these men are now brought in over the heads of all the cornets proposed for the Military Train, and are of course taking the place of four lieutenants who are Pleft out of the proposed list to make room for them. This is felt to be a most unjust proceedin. | Let it not be said that these men have been selected becau3e
of their aptitude for the work, for there have been left out of the proposed list as many, or more, good men who left the Artillery to officer the Land Transport Corps when it was uDhill worlc.
Blit these remarks areintendedto sliowhowit affectsthose who were Artillery sergeants in particular, whose prospects of rising from the ranks in their own corps were very remote; take the following as proof :-During the last ten
ears 22 commissions have been given fron tlhe ranks in the nlyArtillery. The average strength of the regiment (exclusive of officers) for those years was 14,180, as per ordnance estimates, thereby showing that the average nu m- ber of commissions from the ranks to each thousand men was 1'o in ten years ; and, be it remembered, that the years l855 and 1856 were more prolific in commissions from the ranks in the Royal Artillery than any two years since the formation of the regiment.
In December, 154, a commission from the ranks was given to each regiment serving in the Crimea when the
attle of Inkermann was fought. The Royal Artillery was estimated at four battalions or regiments, and four sergeants were toreceivecomnmissions. Thesecommissions were given in the Land Transport Corps. As thecorps increased many more commissions were given in the same corps to the sergeants of the Royal Artiltery, and at the present time there are a very great many holding commissions in the corps who were Eergeants in the Royal Artillery. Five of the captains who are offered the rank of lieutenant in the Military Train were in the ArtiBery; the senior, a captain of division in the Land Transport Corps, was the sergeant-major of the field batteries at Woolwich for many years, and had the instruotion of aLl young field batteries in grooming, harnessing, riding, driving, &c., and is fully up to his work. Another was a staff-sereant of a battery for a Ieneth
^t "_ ,ca" arsiTer sjoirng the Land Transport Corps hIs services were so highly appreciated that Colonel
M'Murdo appointed Min Brigade-Major to the corps, which appointment he held until he arrived in England. The other three I know to be fully qualified for the positior they hold; yet these men are to be insulted and degraded to make room for a class of men whom it is the fashion to call gentlemen; indeed, I suppose the plebeiiau would not be retained only that they will be useful to instruct, drill, and do all the dirty work for the gentlemen. There are many other old sergeants of Artillery holding the rank of tieutanant, cornet, aijutant, er quartermaster who are not proposed for the MiSitary Trwin, some of them known in the Artilery to be the very best men of their class, and yet they must be pub aide to make zoom for some who, it is no untruth to say, cannot possibly know anything of the duties they ought to be able to perform; but when the plebeians received their commission their services were required. Now the gentlemen mrst be provided for, and the poor men must go.
I am not vain enough to suppose that anything I may say wl have any effect on these men's cases, nor cTo I suppose that Sir J. Fergusson's remarks in the House of Commons will have any more; but allow me topebit will have this effect-that the knowledge of the unias1 treatment which these men are about to receive will be.*means of preventing hir future any sergeant of Ariflery$;rm tta)ne a leap in te dark, wrhereb he may, while ra ginimself by degrees to an improved position, have the ltd4 suddenly kicked from under 1dm, and he brought to t level from which only too many think he ought'.vtt Seasie-t

The Soulages Collection.
TEE SOULAGFS COLLECTIOy.
The following is the report of the committee appointed by the council of the Royal Institute aT British Architects to examine the Soulages Collection, and report their opinion 'whether it would be expedient to recommend its purchaae by the Government:-
" The enlarged views in regard to architectural decoration which have recently revived the taste for ornamuental design that somo centuries ago was so prevalent in England render it necessary for the architect of the present day to enter upon new fields of study, to seek for new sources of inspiration, and to acquaint himself with all the formulas of conception to be found in the productions of other branches of science and art than those which are directly structural, in order to qualify himself to take that lead in directing public taste which his position and vocation call upon him to assume. It is indisputable that in every age the sources of design for all classes of manufacture have been identified with the productions of the architect, and frequently derived from his conceptions. Axong the ancients the ftiele vases and the bronzes may be quoted in illustration of this fact, as constantly borrowing their ornaments from the buildings of antiquity- And in the medieval period the pillars, the buttresses, the carving, the panelling, and architectural divisions, aU of which were applied so fittings of every description, -were adopted from the structural deatil
of the edlfices, often with little or no reference to material or other proprieties of adaptation.
" As the architect'a development of the artistic element is the highest applicable to the common purposes of life, it is obvious that the revival of obsolete sources of decoration demands the utmost circumspection. To acquit himself conscientiously of such a responsibility he must neglect no means of information-he must underrate no style, no object, no department, which may contribute to those harmonious effects which it is his province to endeavour on all ocasions to irsure. ie must enter upon a new career of thought, and aequaint himself with the history andfiuctuations that have distinguished each phsse of the origin, developement, and decay of every class of applied ornamentso as to adopt it with propriety, taste, and originality, as an ever fresh idea, and not as a mere I rifacciamento ' of existinz forms.
* Collections like those of M. Soulages and of the late Mr. Bernal are of the utnost value to the architect, reflecting as they do the arts, manufacture, skill, and taste of various countries and periods; and showing their application to the ordinary uses of life in the severalgrades of society. No less remarkable are they when set in contrast with the industrial practice of the first quarter of the present century,--a period of singular barrenness in technical design, since they serve to bear only a more vivid testimony to the extent to which art was applied in the most trifling and ordinary utensils and objects, during those palny days of Italian grandeur when were executed the majority of the specimens of which those collections consist. During such periods the sentiment of art would appear to have been absolutely necessary to commend the productions of the skdlled mechanic to general acceptance. And it is remarkable to observe that taste never became the exclusive property of any one department or class of productions, but reigned an universal element, the decline of purity in any manufacture being but the sign of a general and concurrent deterioration in every other. Snch collections represent a worldwide school, in which to form an universal rather than a particular standard of national taste; and thus the student is freed from the trammels of that confined view of style which the traditions of any one period, limaited within a narrow geographical circle, would
ind around him. France, Italy, Germany, and England have furnished their quota of excelence in many ways to the scimens now brought together in Marlborough House; and 5rom the very distinctive peculiarities which characterize the various productions a wider field is afforded for the wares of the manufacturer of the present day, fresh tastes are excited, and an earnest longing is created in the purchaser for the possession of more refined and excellent productions; raising them above mere mechaiical results, enlarging their sphere of application and necessarily stimulating production.
" There can be littie healthy progress in national manuifacture so long as the commonest and mere material wantg only have to be satisfied; but directly cultivated taste seeks for superior execution and more refined elegance, enterprise and skill are enlisted in the gratification of those tendencies, progressive improvements constantly arise, industry and commerce gain by the movement, and the material prosperity of those engs ged therein necessarily foUows.
"EN,AELS.
"There are many arts which once flourished in this country, and which have been applied only in a very limited manner within a century or two, while there are others which have never received in Great Britain the developement of which they are capable, and which in other countries have been productive of very important results. EnameUing was at one time extensively used in England, as we may see on the metaUic monuments in Westminster Abbey, some of the recumbent figures of which were covered with elaborate ornaments of this nature, as also the heraldic shields occasionally inserted in brasses. It is now almost entirely confined to smaUer works of the jeweller's craft, or elaborate reproductions of choice pictures and portraits; whereas in the Bernal and Sonlages colections are to be found medaUions and plates of considerable dimensions, and the art applied to tazze, inkstands, and salt-cellars, enriched withr most delicate arabesques and historical subjects. Such specimens give renewed hope that we may ultimately realize at moderate cost the process of enameiling on slabs of lava, brought under-the attention of this institute some years since by an honorary and corresponding member, M. Hittorff, now president of the section of fine arts of the Institue of France, or medallion portraits of a nature somewhat similar to those introduced in the farade of the Academie des Beaux Arts at Paris by N. Duban. There seems no reason, if public taste afforded the encouragement, why enauielled panels might not be successfully introduced as an architectural decoration, durable as to material, briliant in colour, and unchangeable in effect. A notable instance of such an application of enamel existed in the famous Chateau de Madrid in the Bois de Boulogne, Paris, which has been the theme of praise by aU writers who have mentioned it. The faradc was adorned with enamels 5 feet high by 3 feet 4 inch wide, nine of which still exist in the Hotel de Cluny.* Were such panels capable of being multiplied at a moderate cost, we might from time to time introduce in our buildings a series of aU but imperishable portraits of our sovereigns, of eminent men and historical characters; not, asin past times, confining the subject of suoh enamels to the 12 (hesars, the labours of Hercules, or such pedantic abstractions, hut adopting themes from our own Poets writers, and historians; and these would come more home to the feelngs, and commemorate for popular honour and respect those celebrities who have illustrated our owin history and have rendered eminent services to our country.
" MEDALS,
Medal die engraving is at present of very restricted ap. plication, being generally limited in this country to too snall a class of Objects; and little patronage is bestowed upon what was among the ancients, and after the revival, a most important department of art production. The medals and coinage of antiquity are upon a par with the productions of Phidias, Lysippus, and raxiteles; and the coins of Sicily and many towns of Greece, the medals of Alexander and ssuccessors, as well as the Roman Imperial series, reflect the genius of the brightest eras of antique taste and skill. Of Fcarcely inferior merit were the Italian medals - and the medallions of various sizes-whether cast or strack -of the 15th and 16th centuries are ful of intense meaning, hancing down to us, with the utmost vigour and retinement of expression, the ineaments of the great, the noble, or the ilustrious of those periods.
"Of such gems the Soulages collection contains 106 specimens, chiefly of Italian and French art, struck or cast, presenting many varieties of treatmcnt, and suggestive of an useful application of such memorials in modern times, combining valuable icatbetic results with historical records o f an almost imperishable nature.
" GLiss.
"The brilliant progress which has been made in the manufacture of glass in this country within the few years that have elapsed since the removal of those fiscal restrictions which arrested all improvement and threw this country behind others invests the articles of this class in the Souleges collection with great interest. Without entering into the technical processes of the 'laticinio,' 'vitro di trina,' ' millefiori,' 'aventurine,' and ' schaelke,' some of whuch ere already practised in England, we may at once confidently predict that the study of choice specimens like those presented to view in AMarlborough-house will lead to the developement of new combinations, which wll some day distinguish our Englsh manufactures as much as, if not more than, their Italian or Bohemian predecessors. The rapid advance in the scientific manufacture of glass, .and the new applcations of that material which have recently been brought to light for the supply of architectural r4quirements, are lone sufflcient to convince us that this ara is capable of the utmost developement tbrnanh Ens¢ih.ehntemrise.
'BRONZxS.
"The 106 objcts in bronze comprised inl the Soulages collection iUlustrate a class of manufacture hitherto of very limited application in Englsnd; whereas in her Eastern dependencies the artists in bronze for centuries past have produced, even in common utensils, elegance of form and unrivaUeddecoration in metaUic inlay. This latterelegant process, which was of ,essentially Oriental origin, was eagerly adopted by the Venetians, and re-produced in their Damas. coened wre.
" Ters of thousands of French artisans are maintained by their skilful treatment of bronze, now an essential article of furniture in that counrry, and purchased with avidity in England and, indeed, thro_ghout Europe and America. So unpractisedare our founders in the successful castingof such delicate objeets, and as deficient are we in educated chasers and finishers, that se have to depend mainly on foreigners for the supply of smcl4lbronzes. Their production by English manufacturers is, indeed, so costly that the Art-Union of London (who for nbany years devoted much attention to the subject, and at gre at expense brought out various statnettes and busts), anxiotas as that body are to encourage the art, have been almogt compeeled to abandon the attempt to any great extent, and -only persevere under the most discouraging circumstances. The beautiful works of art in bronze, so abundant in Paris, h?nd no rivalry here. And we feel, therefore, that the acquisition of the specimens in this collection, although far too limited for the urgent necessity that exists for the supply of good 2,-odels. in this branch of industry, would be desirable, as teL-ding to draw public attention to this important and neglectee' branch of art manufacture. We do not venture to claso them in design or execution with the matchless Productions of antiquity, such as those preserved in the j.Museum of the Studii at Naples, or even with niodern ones of the highest class of art; but satI here are many objects gracefully composed, elegant in form, and especially suggestive of improvement in those departmem:s
* It i smid that some were Prnchased by Englishmen, and are now in thi3 cou*try. It would be a great fervice to the artg if they could te diveovered, and eipgsed in ths Great Exbibition about to be ope*ed at xw4htuttr,
of domestic economT Into which they might be introduced with propriety.
DEcoiRTmV FuR.ITumRE.
"There ame 100 pieces* of funiture and textile fabrics, consisting of cbairs, cabinets, coffers, tables, buffets, dressoirs, metallic mirrors, a magnificent lantern, the cornice of a room, three pairs of bellows of tasteful design and execution, and an elaborate chimney-piece. These present a store of useful and applicable articles of various merit. Some few are carved with considerable skill, others are distinguished for their general design or graceful proportions. Some have been considerably repaired or modified by inferior hands, bat others remain intact. The buffets and armoires are suggestive, and admit of easy application to our present uses. The chestnut-wood coffers, the marriagechests of Italian history and romance, have evidently originated in X superior class of artists, and the metal mirrors, with their carved frames, are graceful ilustrations of a curious vAriety of domestic utensils. In all these articles it is necessary to discriminate between the production of the manufacturer who repeats, and the treatment of his material by the artist who onginates. We may still be enabled to recognize clearly those forms and expressions of original ideas, vulgarized by the common taste of those who repeat or demand repetiion ifor, although coarse in parts or gross in detail, they may stll retain some of the elements of that antecedent period when livelier imagination, more refinement, and truer sentiment prevailed. The textile fabrics contain some very elegaiit ornamnental patterns, and several curious specimens of embroidery.
" MAJOLICA.
"We have reserved for our concluding remarks the most numerous and most important section of this collectionnamely, the majolica, and enamelled earthen and stone Wares, consisting of 168 pieces.'j We shall not~ enlarg upon the mutual relations of art and material, nor upon the extent to wbich all branches of fine art are iniluenced by the mtetrials employed. This is especially perceptible in the earthenwares of Greek art and snajolica, in contrast with the porcelains of Asia% and Europ, and their works in this class are as distinct as the earth of which they are composed. Nor do we pretend to revie the various processes of manufacture, nor the mysteries of the glaze and brilliant lustres which give so much attraction to these admirable productions, such as the metallicreflexions, the changigcolours, themother-o'-pearl of Gubbio, Urbino Pesaro, Caffagiolo, Faenza, Castel Dnrante, or of other towns or States of Italy, where the enlightened patronage of the dukes and princes to these wares realized a reputation that could hardy otherw have been acquired by places of such secondary importance. The earlier pieces of majolica retain much of the noble simplicity of forml and richness of decoration of their Hispano-MIoorish origin; and the later ones have a higher aim thau the porcelains of Germany and
mrance, wnose ans aecorau ons occamiOnaly preset x fantastic and capricious application, and generally a minute and highly-wrought elaboration by superior artists, almost too precious for the frail material upon which it is bestowed, limiting the products to the tables only of the most affluent.
" The majolica, on the contrary, admits, when once the design is settled, of a rapid execution bY practised secondary hands; by this economy in the production most carefully designed objects may be brought writhin the means of the humbler admirer of art. This series includes some choice specimens: of Bernard de Palissy's skill, and embraces every class of object fitted for the table, or to adorn the buffet or dressoir; such as plateaus, plaques, vases, plates, fruttiere, tazze, trays or baskets, cups fasks, bowls, ewers, sauceboats, salt-cellars, and other articles. The finest of these are grouped in one case, and constitute a series of the highest aeshetsc value, as rega r4s their form, the conabinations of colour, and treatment of decoration. They are available as types, or may be considered educationally a s specimens to he followved, imuproved, or varied;? there is not one which is not valuable for the one or other purpose. The success may be problematical of any attempt to derange the predilections and established favour with which the public have been accustomed to regard certain articles of use in common life; but we believe that the public mind is pro pared and anxious to adopt a higher state of attreatmentin such objects.
"Without advocating for a moment a blind adherence to any of these forms, or the modes of decoration which distinguish these wares, in which occasionally the execution rmay not rise tothe digity of the subject-in which extrevegance may now and then have usurped the place of good taste, and in which noble forms may be here vad there applied to inferior uses-we may clearly recogni7e so muc that is noble and brilliant, so much that is full of feeling and expression, and such an appeal to a bigherinteligence as to warrant our maintaining distinctly that access to such examples must improve the taste of the people and elevate the aspirations of every mind for something netter than thosewe already possess. This consummation we are indeed justified in prognosticating (from the successful efforts in majolica made by the firm of MInton for the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1855) our own countrymen on the banks of the Trent and the Severn are fully able to attain. From those exertions we may reasonably contemplate that, in a few years by the teaching aid of such examples as those contained in the Soulages collection, by the union of manufacturing skill in ,the manipulation with artistic power in the embellishment, and by due encouragement from the public, majolica will become in this country a most attractive and very important branch of art production, and eventually compete with the ceramic works of any period and of any country.
" In conclusion, we have to report that we are unable to contemplate, without the deepest regret, the possibility of such a collect,on being broken up and scattered into various channels. Each individual piece has its own peculiar value or merit; but when combined with others, as illustrating either the theory or history of art, so as to complete the chain and connexion of manufacture and art iUlustration, and thus forming a series of the progressive excellence to which such productions have been carried in times past, their worth is much enhanced. If Government were to rely upon the chances of a sale they would probably be outbid for the best articles by wealthy individuals, who will gratify a taste at a fancy price, and thus the museums of the nation would have in such an event only the chance of obtaining secondary articles, purchased at greatly enhanced cost.
" In making this report the committee have deemed it more advisable to submit their opinions, based, after a careful examination of the objects, upon a broad and general consideration of their importance as a whole, and as a commencement and very desirable contribution, with the series obtained from the Bernal collection, towards a large and complete historical and artistic museum, rather than upon a minute criticirm of any individual specimens. And they have come to the conclusion that it would be an irreparable loss of a geat opportunity to improve our manufactures, to enare the sphere of art applicatioo, to increase our commerce, and instruct the public mind, if the Government did not accept the offer to sell the whole to the nation at cost price-an offer so nobly made by the disinterested and public spirited men who, with singular generosity, and on their own responsibility, have at all risks afforded the opportunity to the country of Securing the collection in its entirety.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-The proceedings of the Educational Committee of Manchester and Salford, reported in your columns, are open to afew remarks which, as an old-stager in the matter of public and parochial education, I should be glad to offer.
The happy family which embraces in its group three such distinguished men as Sir John Pakington, Sir .J. IL Shuttleworth, and Mr. Cobden, may not, after all, be able to carry matterson asharmoniously as they seemtohavebegun. Bat we shall see more when the question gets into the House of Commons, when Mr. Henley and others will be able to remind Sir J. Paldngton of the change which has come o'er him, and the oblivion in his present soheme of certain points which he urged as vital in his former expositions.
But I am now most of all concerned to support the view which I think you have so justly taken of the present system of public aid, as administered by the Privy Conncil Comr mittee, and which, though stil susceptible of many Improvements, has done so much for the country at large; and why should not the present plan have a fair trial ? Such not less than half a century can properly afford. Granting that the Comsnittee of Council, with its new vice-president, will, inthe eourse of three years, require fully 1,000,0001. per annum for their purposes, how much of this may we not hope will be saved to the country from gaol and prosecution expenses ?
Let it be considered how great the discouragement iS which freque-t changes in the system of pablic asfistance inflicts.
In 1846, but 10 years ago, we were stimulated as parochial clergymen to gain the public confidence for the fair trial of tho Minutes. Now, if the Manchester people prevail we Are to mix up with the Minutes and the GCovernnent aid the control as to inspection and secular instrac. tion of a local boardL Are we, then, to have two sets of inspectors, not only to pay, but also to please 7
Observe, aLSo, that the scheme referred to permits an exclusively secular system, 'which opens the door of public support to men of no faith, as well as of " all faith," and to men of avowed atheistic principles. On this part of the system Sir John Pakington wiselv keensgsilenrp
{The Manchester party greemud their demand for a permissive system of local rates, partly on the necesity of placing a check upon centraliation in DowXing.street, and partly on the insufficiency of our preseat schools. As to the fir,t of these, it is clear that they woxs,emplate the superseding of the Privy Council plan as soon as they cai get their plan made compulsory, which Sir J. Pa}dngton avows to be his ultimatum. And, as to the second mntter-oar present inefficiency-what better shall we be unuoer their sew plan, so long as children are in such demand in the market of labour, and in many such towns as ours, where &ere is no protection by law preventing children as early as seven or eight years of age being employed in public workshopg and factories ?
These are all very important considerations, and sggetive of many others which a Parliamentary abate will elicit.

Railway Intelligence.
RAILWAY INTBLLIGFENQy.
GREAT WESTERN.
The report of the directors of this company has just been issued. I states that the accounts of railway revenuo to the 31st of December last (an abstract of which appeared in 27w Times of Monday) comprise the receipts and expendit of in respect of the following new lines, being two porlions of the Wilts, Somerset, and Weymouth Railway, and ,he Uxbridge Branch, in addition to those previously completed-namely, between Warminster and S&lisbury, opened on the 30th of June last, 20 miles; from Frome to Yeovil, opened on the 1st of September, 251 miles, and West Drayton and Uxbridge, opened on the 8th of Sep. tember, 2i miles-together, 48 miles; and 14 additional stations. With that additional mileage, the comparison of net revenue during the corresponding period of 1855 may be stated as follows:-Increase orn the Great Western Railway -in passengers, 29,0481.; in goods, minerals, &c., 19,105. . in parcels, 3,6051.; and in other sources of revenue, 8,8421.' together, 60.600l.- from which is deducted 12,9241. for additional working charges, leaving the total incre seof net earnings for the half-year, 47,6761. The increase in tho Shrewsbury Railway, in passengers, &c., was 3,0581.; and in goods and minerals, 14,7831.; together, 17,8411.; from which is deducted 6501. decrease in other aources of traffic, leaving 17,1911., deducting proportion due according to mileage of goods for working them to and from Birkenhead, &c., 5,2751., leaving 11,9161. The additional working charges amounted to 5,5661., leaving 6,350l. as the total increase of net earnings on the Shrewsbury lines. The total increase in the receipts on the Great Western and Shre.wsbury lines was 77,7911., less 5,2751., and in additional working charges 18,490C., leaving the total increase of net earaings for the half-year 54,0261. With respect to the Kennet and Avon Canal account the auditors advise the reduction of the capital account or purchase cost of the canal, by placing the excess snm between certain ituams to that account, and they recommend provision to bemade outtof theGreatWestern revenue for the balance against the canal, resulting from five years' working, of 9,380,, a course to which the directors, underthe circumstauces of the case, have given their assent. This defdiency does not properly become a charge altogether to
revenue, for a considerable portion of it is admitted to be due to the cost of construction of the Wilts, Somerset, and Weymouth Railway, the works tf which have occasioned frequent stoppages of the canal itself, and consequent loss of freight during such stoppages. The mode approved by the auditors for meeting it is to charge the whole balance to the revenue account within five years, by placing 1,3801. to the credit of the Kennetand Avon Canal in the last six months, and writing off in each subsequent year 2,0001. until the whole sum shaU have been liquidated. After defraying aU charges which have priority out of the revenues of the Great Western Company, the sum of 140,8221. remains available for a dividend on the consolidated stock; and the directors bavemnuchsatisfactioninrecommending, under the improved condition of this undertaking, that the dividend for the last half-year be increased fromn 2; to to 3 per cent. per arnum, which wiU allow a balance of 17, 281. to be carried forward to the next account. Added to this, the board advert to a claim for a considerable amount on the Postmaster-General in excess of the sum credited for mail services, which is likely soon to be decided by arbitration. From the peculiar nature of those services, for which there are already two years of arrear to be received from the Post-office, the directors entertain no doubt that the balance in aid of the accounts of the current halfEyear will be much increased upon theavwardbeing made. The fund for "accidenta," established in 1849, has now reached the agreed balance of 20,0001. in reserve, over and above all payments for compensation under that head. The capital accounts embrace the further expenditure during the half-year for aU the lines then under construction, of which about 37 miles have been since opened for passenger traffic-viz., between Yeovil and Weymouth, and between Bradford and Bath. The only portions of railway which are still in course of construction consist of the Devizes and Henley branches (about 13 miles), both offwhich lines will be completed in the spring. All the Parliamentary obligations for new railways belonging to this company wiU thus be fulfiled, and the directors have steadily adhered to the principle of not entering into further engazements of the samie description. Two branch railwais connected with the Great Western system have been undertaken exdusively by local subscriptions-viz., the Abingdon Railway and the Bridport tailway; and a third branch from Hatton, near Warwick, to Stratford-upon-Avon is promoted under similar circumstances without any pecuniary assistance from this company, and is now before Parliament for the sanction of the Legislature. The directors have thought it right in all those cases to enter into agreemeats for finding the plant acd working those lines in connexion withthe traSic of the mtin line, during a limited period, without undertaking any guarantee or liability for their capital, but without exacting anyprofitoverand above the exlienses actually incurred in working them. Application has also been made to the directors by local subscribers projecting a line between Hungerford and Devizes for a permanent working arrangement of such hne, when constructed, on conditions similar to that of the lease of the Hereford, Ross, and Glocester RailwIay, and they recommend authority to be given to enterinto an agreement for that purpose. The direct6oL mnst report that some modifications in the subsisting agreements between the CornwaU Railway Company and the Great Western, Bristol and Exeter, and South Devon Associated Comparies have become indispensable, in order to aecure out of the resources of the CornwaU Company the completion of that portion of their line which is leased to the three companies, due regard being had to the interests of all the parties to those agreements. Application has therefore been made to Parliament for the requisite powvers. The main purposes in view are to enable the Cornwall Railway Company to raise the additional capital necessary for completing the line between Plymouth and Truro by disposal of their preference shares, with the assistance of the credit of the associated companes, but such preference charge to be provided out of the revenues of the Cornwall Railway, who are also to defray every expense incidental to it. The increased liability of this company is limited to two ninth parts of the amount, and under the modified arrangements will not exceed 2,0001. per aunum. The directors consider it a desirable atrangement, which ought to be completed with as little delay as possible. The question of rates or the conveyance of coals over the Great Western lines bavisig been raised by an advertisement and circular letters which tend to mislead the proprietors and to impute to the board preferential dealing, the directors think the best answer to such misrepresentations, industriously propagated to serve a particular object at this moment, will be to publish an authorized scale of the rates, as wel as the particulars of the system which is in operation, equally and impartially with every freighter wFho may be willing to transmit coals over this railway. It iS perfectly trne that a retail dealer who may send single trucks of coals, or coals in small quantities, whenever he pleases, without engagement or obligation of any description to the company, pays more for the single truck than the freighter who engages to provide ful train-loads, adapted to the power of the engine, sent at all seasons of the year, andfor a stipulated annual amount of freight payable to theocompany. The question really is whether such rates are disproportionate or otherwise, and the publication of the scale wil be the best mode of testing it. The directors can say with confidence that their sole object has been to secure to the lines the utmost amount of freight from coals, carried in the manner most economical an,!
remunerative to tne proprietors, and upon one uniform principle, applicable alike to all and recognized as just. It was sanctioned by the highest opinion of counsel immediately after the last February meeting, and the system has since been confirmed as legal by a recent decision of the Court of Common Pleas To this principle the directors feel it their duty to adhere, and theg will rejoice to find that itis extensively adopted by the Somersetshire, Forest of Dean and all other collieries, whether large or small, under arrange. ments with this company, similar to that which is now in force with the Ruabon Coal Company lt willprobably be a satisfaction to the proprietors to learn that immediate measures were taken by the directors at the instant of the discovery of frauds which had been committed in certain other companies by the transfer of stock or shares to have allthe registers of this company carefully examined; and a most elaborate report was drawn up and delivered by the accountant, after such investigation, to the directors and auditors, verifying the accuray of the registers and the correctness of the system upon which they have been kept. It is due to the principal registrar of the company to say that he was the first person to suggest this course, and that the result reflects great credit upon him and all who have been engaged in that department It is intended for the future to transmit notice, by letter, to every proprietor transferring stock to acquaint hima that the deed has been presented for entry, in order that he may warn the directors, without delay, of irregularity or fraud, if any should exist. Every proprietor wishing, by way of precaution, to ascertain at any time the amount of stock registered in his name shall, upon inquiry, receive immediate information thereof rom this office Appended to the report is a statement of the total charge per ton for coals over the Great Western lines referred to in the foregoing report. From the tabular statement it appears the contract charge, in full train loads for distances exceeding 100 miles, the total freight being 5,0001. and upwards perlannum for a term is 7-16ths of a penny, and for use of iaggons 1-16th of a penny per ton. Retail charge, in single trucks for distances exceeding 50 miles, without any engagement for quantitv or time, 8-16ths of a penny, and for use of waggons 2-16ths of a penny per ton.

the Great Western Railway, is fast approaching to completion. The mixed gange from Birming am to Basingstok
together with the avoiding line at Didcot, and the junction curve near Reading, commonly called the Reading Fork, have been completed, and the entire line opened for publio t,raffic on ehe narrow gauge in Docember last. The whole of the new arrangements at Paddingtonstationarenowapproaching completion. The goods shed and warehonse, con. stituting the second portion of the merchandise arrangements, completing the whole of the original design, are now finished; the rails are being laid inte the platforms, and the roadways being paved; the cranes and other hydraulic power arrangements in the shed and warehouses ae fixed Several important additions and improvements have been made at the several stations on the lines northward and also at Swindon and. Bristol, for affording increased secommodation to the goods

Hospices On Barren Islands.
HOSPICES ON BARREN ISLANDS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TMES.
Sir,-Forty-four miles north of the Equator, longitude29 deg, west, there stands the island of :St. Paul's. This island is in the track of vessels trading between India and! the Australian colonies- and many captains of vessels bound from London, Liverpool, and other ports mnake a point of sigbting the island, in order to test the accurary of their chronometers.
Some 20 years ago a ship caled the Lady Munro, %onnd from Calcutta to Sydney, struck on the island, daurti?adark night. With the exception of1the surgeon and a Lascar, all on board-passengers and crew-nerhd.
In 1845 a Dutch Indiaman, clled the John Hendrick. was totally lost on St. Paul's. The captain and some of the crew were saved; the remainder were drowned in an attempt to land some provisions.
Immediately under the line, and without fresh water, the sufferings of these survivors (19 in number) were of the most painful character. On the fifth day, however, when. they ad sunk down to die, a vessel caUed the Chance hove in sight. A signal was hoisted, and the Chance lowered a boat. But oat of the 19 seven only wAre Eaved, for before the boat could return for the remainder a strong breeze sprang up, and the sea ran so high it was impossi le to approach the rocks. In the hope that the gale wvould moderate the Chance stood off and on the island for several days; but, as the wind kept up, and nothing could be discerned of the unfortunates, it was concluded they had died from tha heat and want of food and. water. Under these circumstaunces the Chance proceeded on her voyage. Among the 11 left on the island was tho surgeon of of the wrecked vessel.
Some three years and a-half ago another awful wreck occurred on the island of St. Paul's. An emigrantship bound for Sydney (from London or Liverpool) struck during the night. The greaterportion of her living freight,-men women, and children,-perished. The survivors, some 2S persons, escaped death, and climbed to the summit of thek rocks, as did the crew of the John Hendrick. These unfortunate beings were eventually rescued, with great difficulty, by the captain of an American wbaling vessel, whose gaUlant and glorious conduct was handsomely acknowledged and rewarded by the British colonists at the Mauritius. The meritorious exertions of Mr. C. J. Bayley, late Colonial Secretary of the island, and now Governor of the Bahamas, were, as the time the theme of comment in most of the Indian and colonial journals.
It mnay be mentioned that foggy weather is not unusual in the vicinity of 6t. Paul's lsland, and further, that there are no soundings within 100 yards of the rocks.
Other ships, besides the three above alluded to, have been wrecked on St. Paul's; but it is needless to give a catalogue of them; and is it unreasonable to conjecture that some of the very many vessels that have never been heard ofvessels bound from London and Liverpool for Australiahave here struck and gone to pieces 7
Since the traffic between England and the Australian colonies is becoming greater every year, and insomuch as the most skilful and careful navigators in the world are liable to be a few miles out of their reckoning, I would suggest the erection of a hospice on the island of bt, Paul's. Su hospice should be built on the summit of the rock, andc consist or two large apartments, Supplies of bedding, clothes, fuel, and provisions of every kind the least perish. able should be placed within these apartments, likewise spirits, wins, and such comforts, medical and other, as the sick and famished require. A reservoir for water might be attached to the building, and so constructed that the rain would keep it constantly flled.
At a short distance from the hospice there should be erected a magazine, snrmounted by a tall flagstaff. WIthin the magazine should be placed the flags of all nationsEnglish, French, American, Dutch, Danish, Spanish, &c. ; also, lanterns, bluelights, and rockets, and two large guns ; and an ample stock of powder and fowling-pieces, for shooting water-fowl ; and cutlasses for killing seal.
In addition to the necessaries of life, and the othermatters already mentioned, there should be left on the island spars, planks, and tools of every description, for the purposes of boatbuiiaing.
In most of the cases of shipwreck that have beenrecorded the survivors have experienced great difficulty in reaching the summit of the rock. This nuiht be obviated by a few chain ladders placed at the various points where a ship's approach would be most probable.
The erection of a hospice would not, of course, be any preventive against shipwreck. But it would tend to alleviate the miseries of those saved, and spare the public the perusal of those painful and revolting details which find their way into the newspapers whenever nan accident happens on the island of St. Paul's.
oere is another quarter of lobe which has been the scene of awfulprivations,-namely, Torres Straits. Numhers of vessels in search of homeward freights every year come through this dangerous passage from Sydney to the various ports in the East Indies. On the "harrier reefs" scores of vessels have been lost within the past 20 years,'
The first anchorage, after'clearing the harrier, is nuader the lee of an island called Hardy's Ind-a barren and uninhabited spot whereon many a seaman has starved, Then comes Bird Island, York Island, and, lastly, Booby Island. Upon saU of these islands have shipwrecked mariners suffered the most fearfrl privations. Some 15 years ago a number of skeletons were found on Booby Island. Under a heap of stones, caUed " The Post-office," there was a letter, stating that they had "died of stan-ation," Upon each of these islands a small hospice might be very easiy erected, and without any sort of danger to those employed. Having landed upon three of them, I speak, not from hearsay, but from Personal observation and experience.
So far as St. Pauls Island is concerned I confess that the difficulty of erecting a hospice would be very cornsiderable, but not so great a difficulty but that it might be overcome by perseverance and a yexrs labour. Anl now comes the question of expense, What would be the expense of erecting these hospices 7 1 make no doubt that there are many enterprising contractors who would under. take the entire work for 75,0001. The next question is how such expense ought to be defrayed. I should say by a subscription among the shipowners of all nations; and among so many how trifling would be the individual tribute! The English and foreign Governments might also be induced to render some assistance, and place a few ships at the disposal of the trustees of the fund collected for the purpose of executing so charitable a design.
Wbat is the joy of the frostbitten traveller who is received into the Hospice of St. Bernard or the Simnplon ! What would be that of the shipwrecked mariner when thrown by the violence of the waves upon a desolate rock, to find a home erected for him by human hands, and whUe he is rendering thanks to God for his deliverance fro>n the deep, to feel that there is no dread of his perishing mliserably from hunger and exposuro to the elements'
I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your obedient servant.

TO THB EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-With reference to your report in Thec Times of to. day of the trial of this action, allow me to say it was brought byl my client, a hiehly respectable tradesman of Bath, for tho single purpose of vindicating his character against &a aspersion of it by the defendant, who pleaded two pleasIst, not gQulty; 2d, a justification. The plaintiff took ttp a body of 'witnesses to London to prove the defendant'g words and refute his justification of them.. The Judge (Baron Pollock) directed the jury that if at the time the defendant spoke the words he believed thema to be true, and did not speak thenm maliciously they were not acionable, and on the first issue they mus't
fidtheir verdict for the defendant. Accordingly the jury acutted the defendant on the first issue, but on the second (1whih was of far greater importance to the plaintiff) the jury found for himn. For your satisfaction I send you a copy of the endorsement which the plaintiff's senior couins-el Mr. Slade, Q.C., made upon his brief :-" Jury find for defendant no malice, but wish, if possible, that each party shoud pa hisown osts Secnd isue,for plaintiff."
