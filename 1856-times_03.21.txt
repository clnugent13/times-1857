WO EY-HABKBand IT sTBLLI1RNcs. hedThursday Evening. 'TheEnglish funcls opened steadily this morning, and subsequently erhibited considerable ffimness. Consolsfor money were first quoted 921 to i, whenoG ;here was a gradual improvement to 924 to i, at hich they remained to the close. For the 11th of Lpl t-he last price w;as 94 to }. A statement -was circulated that the treaty of peace will be signed on Zaster Monday, and the confidence entertamed that everything with respect to it is virtually completed was one of the causes of the advance in prices. Arn increased supply of money likewise tended to support the market, several purchases having been made on the part of the public. In the discount-market, however, there was rather less ease than d-urig the early part of the week. Consol scrip left off 2 to ri premium; Exchequer scrip, 2a to A premium; B3aDk Stock was quoted- 218, wSith divictend for the opening. India Stock, 225 to 227. India-bonds, 12s. to 8s. discount; IExchequer-bonds, 984 to A, and Exchequer-bills (June) par, (March) 2s. to 5s. premium. Foreign securities were maintained with firmness, and in some cases there was a tendency to further improvement. Turklish Six per Cents. were negotiated at 97z for money, and 97A, and 98 for the account. In the Four per Cent. Guaranteed StockI the transactions were at 100k and i for the account. The general business comprised-IZanish Three per Cents., 864; Mexican, 201. and J ; Peruvian, 78} and 79; Russian Five per Cents., 104- ; the Small, 93 ; Sardinian Five per Cents. 93 for money, and && and 93 for the account; Spanish Three per Cents., 45; the New Deferred 24k, i, 25 and 24i; P?assive, 7i; andfDutchTwo-and-a-falf per Cents., 46ti 3o-morrow being Good Friday business was transacted in the foreign exchanges this afternoon. Ulhere was no great alteration from the rates of last Tuesday, but biUls generally were rather more in demand. The closing prices of the French Three per Cents. on the ParisBourse this evening were 72f. 20c. for tnoney, and 72f. 30c. for the account, showing a decline of nearly a-half per cent. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week, shows a limited business arid a downward tendency. The amount of specie by the West India mail today is 140,0001., of which 100,0001. is gold, and 40,OOL. silver. At a meeting of the Canada Company held today, Mr. C. Franks presiding, the report and accounts for the year 1855 were unanimously adopted. General satisfaction was expressed at the progress of the company, and it was stated that the latest advices are favourable. With regard to 60,000 acres of land which have been forfeited through settlers not having fulfilled their engagemnents, it was explained that these parties possems no power of redemption. The average rate at which sales have been made is 43s. 9d. per acre, while the estimated value of the land in 1854 was only 22s. 9d. The act of Parliament which the company are seek ing to obtain for faciliating thle adlministration of the property has, t is believed, received the sanction of the Board of !Thade, and is passingr throug h its ordinary stages in the House of Commons. With reference. to an appeal for a partial remission of income-tax, the directors mentioned that they have thus far abstained from talding any proceedings, as they do not consider that any distribution has yet been made affecting capital. When, however, a payment is proposed to the proprietors which may be regarded as including a return of capital as well as profits, an application will be sent in. 3Ir. J. Perry, the secretary, retires, after a lengthened service, on his full salary. Annexed is an abstract of the report:- * The accounts for the year 18.55, tal;en in connexion with those of 1854, show that the company's affairs are in a state of great prosperity and of important progress. The year 1S54, through a combination of circumstances, was a period of unprecedented prosperity to Canada. The construction of railroads and of other public works throughout the pro~ince was proceedin with -igour. The amount of money remitted for those purposes and for investment in the purchase of real estate and provincial securities was very considerable; the harvest excellent both in quantity and quaTity, aud prices of produce high. The emigration also was larger than it had been for many ycaui. The Canada Company benefitted greatly by this state of affaisr in every branch of theirtransactions, as shown by the acconnts of 1854. Dring the past year, however, mnany circumstances have occurred which have tended to check the continuance of the great prosperity which mark-ed its predecessor. The state of monetary affairs in England partiaUy suspended the carrying out of the numerous works commenced in the province, and stopped the progress of those about to be undertaken. The remittances to Canada in IS55 were, consequently,. as may well be conceived, limited in amount," and the scarcity of money in !Erurope has produced its corresponding effect in Canada, where a very high rate of interest can readily be obtained on good security. The lumber trade has also suffered mich in the past year through the embarrassments in Europe, and the emigration in 1S53 amounted to only 21,274 per;sons, while in 1854 the numbers were 53,153. In this position of af6hirs the report of the transactions of the company in 185,5 may be considered as extremely satisfactory. In disposing of the company's lands the policy hitherto pursued 'has been neither to force the sale thereof, nor to vwithhold them from market, but to abide the result of the progress ofthe province, and thus to obtain the advantage of tho rapid increase of wealth which was sure to arise from the opening up of the country by the various public works, and y the extension of settlement fromthe spreading of the increased population. The sale of the public lands,'which have been disposed of at very low prices, has naturally contributed to the extended cultivation of the province, and has thus brought some part of the company's lands more within the centre of settlement. It may be fully expected that the rapid progress the province is making in commerce, wealth, and popuation, combined with the great facilities afforded through the leasing system (which experience has shown to be admirably adapted to promote the convenience of settlers) will afford the company, with careful and judicious management, every advantage they can reasonably expect in the disposal of their remaining lands. This has been well shown in the price obtained during the past year, Mhich averages 43s. 9Ld an acre, being an excess of 21s. per acre over the valuation of 1854, or an advance of nearly 100 per cent. The directors have to report that the necessary steps have been taken for obtaining the act of Parliament auTthorized at the last general court, which has been brought in, and is now in progress through the E[ouse of Commons.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES, Sir,-I observe from a notice in your city article, pub. lished on Ionday, the 17th inst., that a deputation had waited on the Chancellor of the Exchequer to urge the Pustness of a change in the existing duties, on nutmegs. rermit meto quote the following extract froi the catalogue prepared by the Jamaica Society of Arts of articles ex- ibited from that island at the Universal Exposition in ]?aris : "No. 394-Eight bottles of nutmegs, in spirits. The nutmeghas been proved to thrive adirsbly in Jamaica, particularly in a humid locality, and wil bear fruit in six or seven years from planting, producing two crops annually. A tree in the Botanical Garden, 15 feet in height, matures from. 900 to 1,000 fruit annually. The nutmeg requires little cultivation, and could readily be grown hero to any extent." w hr t n This is the testimony of the curator of the Botanical Garden, and claims consideration. In the failing condition of the larger staples, it is surely of im7ortance to encourage the production of such a valuable article of comnerce as the nutmeg, which-can most effectually be done by reducing the duty on the colonial cultivated article. Should you see fit to give insertiontothis communication, te claim of a prostrate colony to consideration may 'eet the eye, and thus attract the attention of, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. lYours obsdiPltUvv L.

THkBBEAKING 7P OF THZ ICE AT ST. LOUI.- (Fromi the St. Louir ZTPpuolticaan Feb. 27.) Yesterday morning the apprehensions of all connected with the river were excited by a despatch from Alton, stating that it rise of 10 feet had taken place at that point, caused by back water from the Misouri, which was pouring out a tremendous current-the gorge below. St. Charles having been swept away. Predictios were then made that the ice here would break up about 3 or 4 o'clock p.m., when the rise would have had time to reach this point. Accordingly, every boat commenced preparing forthe crisis, by shipping a crew and getting up steam. For several hours all was expectancy and suspense on the "levee." Until U1 'clock a.nm. the xiver contmued to. fall, probably on account of a gorge having given way below.. The riverthen commenced rising veryrapidly, andat2 o'clockp.m.hadfisen about three feet. Alnost all the boats at tho levee had steam up, and were tuaming their wheels. Ice now commenced running in large cakes, and lodging against the gorge at the foot of Washington-avenue. The current became very rapid and swept aud boiled under the gorged ice in the whirlpools, carrying mnuch of the floating ice with it. The ferryboats across the river commenced whistling almost continually, and thousands of persons were attracted to the levee, all anxious to see the first movement of the ice. The boatmen were generally aboard~ of their boats. Presently the steamer F. X Aubry, lying at the extreme upper end of the levee, raised a long whistle, and exclamations of " The ice is coming !I" were passed through the crowd, the whole length of the levee. The excitement now became intense, and the stoire windows were suddenly seen crowded with spectators, many of whom were laies. The first object that attracted attention was an old stove, which came down on a large piece of ice, which was instantly capsized and sunk. T'hon came an old steamboat hull, which, when it strack the gorge, was turned bottom mpwavrds and-carried under the ice. It swung around against one of the Alton .wharf boats, and, together with a large field of ice which caine just behind it, broke the. fastenings of the boet and drove it forcibly ashore. The crovwd who had collected on the wharf boat for a nearview of the scene immediately scattered, and at this instant, 10 minutes past 2 o'Cock, the whole body of ice oppOsite the city commenced moving in an unbroken mass. There was one simultaneous shout, and the crowd became quiet awaiting the resalt. The fire-bells vere toUled, and the news that the ice was moving spread like wildfire through the citg. The crowds of spectators became immense. Foot passen. gers had continued to cross on the ice up to the time of its moving, and about 20 persons were overtaken while crossing on the thoroughfare at the foot of Chestnut-street. They mnade their best possible speed to reach shore, and we believe all gained a safe landing, and had no time to spare. The ice at first moved very slowly and without any per. ceptible shock. The boats lying above Chestnut-street were merely shoved ashore, and for the first five minutes suctamed no damage. Messrs. Irads and Nelson's Submarine No. 4, which had just finished her work at the wreck of the Parthenia, was almost immediately capsized and became herself a hopeless wreck. The Sabmarine floated down, lying broadside against the Federal Arch, which boat was being wrecked and of little value. Here the destruetion commenced. The Federal Arch parted her fastenings, and at once became a total wreck. Lying below, the steamers Australa, Adriatic, Brunette, Paul Jones, Falls City, Altoona, A. B. Chamabers, and ChalLenge, were all torn away from the shore, and in company with the Submarine and Federal Arch, floated down with the immense field of ice. This fleet of 10, boats was more or less damaged at starting by crowding against one another. All the upper works of the Branetteand Australia were torn to pieces, and the Altoona was badly damaged. The shock of the crashing of these boats when they were driven together can be better imagined than described. All their ample fastenings were as nothing against the enormous flood of ice, and they were carried down apparently fastened and wedged together. The first obstacles with which they came in contact were a large fleet of wood boats, baroges, and canal boats. These sirall fry were either broken to pieces, or forced out of the water upon the levee in a very damsaged condition. We are not able to state the number, but there could not have been short of 50 in all, which were either sunk, broken to ieces, or carried away with the descending boots. About 20 of them met vith the latter fate, and the whole fleetlodged about. one mUie below, against the point of the island at the Lower Dyke. The Adriatic lost one of her wheels by swinging agst the Fals City, after they landed upon the har below. The Fals City is very badly damse d. The Paul Jones is also badly damaged. The A. B. Chambers sustained but slight damage. The Challenge did not fare so well, and was badly injured. After these boats had passed down, the lon Accord and Highland Ylary, lying together, were carried off, and are both a total loss. The mew St. Paul, on the docks, was slightly damaged, and part of the docks was swept away from underher. The HighlandMary struckagoainst the Die Vernon, damaging thlatter boat considerably. The Louisville was also torn away from her moorings, and at last accounts was lying broadside and across the current, with the other boats below. She is probably a total loss. The Lamartine was carried awa>y in the same manner, and will doubtless be lest. The Westerner broke her fastenings and swung agnst the Jeannie Deans, injuring the latter boat considerably. Of the other boats, inwhatwasconsidered the safe harbour above the dyke, there is scarcely one that did not receive some slight injury by the contact of the fleet as it passed down, but their damages were comparatively slght, and they are thought to be safe from further harm. Some of the boats lying above Chestnut-street fared badly in the meantime. The F.X. Aubry was forced into the bank, and had her larboard wheel broken. The. noble Nebraska, whicl every one thought in a most periloalu, s5t- tion, lest her larboara Wnees, anna Was not otherwise much injured. The Gossamer, ILuella, Alice, and Badger State, were forced ashore and slightly damaged. Both the Alton wharf boats were sunk and broken to pieces. The old Shenandoah being wrecked, and the Sam Cloon, were forced away from shore and floated down together against the steamer Clara. The Clara did not part her fastenings and the Cloon and Shenandoah lodged, where they were soon torn to pieces and sunk by the ice and one of the ferryboats, which came floating down alone. The ferryboat floated on down to the foot of Market-street, carrying part of the, Shenandoah with her. The steamers Clara and Ben Bolt were both badly damaged by the ice, and forced partly ashore. The G. W. Sparhawlk was sunk, and looked as if broken in two, lying at the shore. *The Keokuk wharf boat maintained its position against the flood, and saved three boats below-viz., the Polar Star, T. S. Pringle, and Forest Rose, none of which were up to this time materially injured. AftQr running about one hour the character of the ice was changed, and it came down in a frothy, crumbled condition, with an occasional heavy piece. At the end of two hours it ran very slowly, and finaly stopped, about half. past 5 o'clook p.m. During this interval a number of pas. sengers crossed it from the ferry, landing on Bloody Island. They were chiefly passengers by one of the trains just arrived, and desirous of reaching the city while they had an opportunity. The experiment was a daring one, hut they all landed safely on this side. Just before the river gorged, huge piles of ice, 20 and 30 feet in height, were forced up by the current on every hand, both on the shore and at the lower dyke, where so many of the boats had come to a halt. In fact, these boats seemed to be literally buried in ice. The ice had not been broken below Cahokia Bend, and all the drift thus far had gorged between the city and that point. Hence its sudden stop. At 6 o'clock p.m. the river had risen at least 10 feet. This suspension of the ice was considered unfavourable, as it would doubtless soon start again with increased weight and force. The thousands of spectators who. had collected on the levee began to disperse as darlness fell upon the devastation scattered around, fully assured that the morning would present a wider scene of ;destraction. There was no way of forming an estimate of the amount of damage that had been done, and no conjccturing that which was to come. The terrible sweep of water, with its burden of ice-the mashing to pieces of. boats--the hurrying to and fro of the excited crowd, was one of the most awful and at the same time imposing scenes we ever witnessed. The officers and crews of many of the boats went down the current with them-the lookers-on became alarmed, and sprang from boat to boat in a ruh for the shore, and we heard it rumoured that two or three lives were lost in the general mCidc. The captains and owners of canal, flat boats, and barges fled, leaving their property to the mercy of circumstances. They could evidently do nothing to save it. About 7 o'clock p.m. the gora'e below sauk jand the ice commenced running ag,an Thie current was now much more swift than it had been before, and the night was very darlk, a heavy and steady rain having set in. It is now uipossible to tell how many boats have been damaged, or to what amount. Of the boats that remained at the wharf at dark the following have been sunk or swept down by the tide:-Regulator, F. X. Aubry, N. L ilbrbur, Alice, Luella, Clara, Ben Bolt, G. W. Sparhawk. Sunk-Polar Star, J. S. Pringle (oaded for New Orleans), and Forest Rose; leaving only tree boats (the Gossamer, Badger State, and Nebraska) at the levee. We are utterly at a loss, to tell how any of the abovenamed boats have fared, or to-what point they will be carried. From a messenger who has just returned froimthe Arsenal we learn that the steamers Adriatic and A. B. Chambers-are lying in a slough just above the Arsenal, safe.

MUR. 4UGVJTUST STAFFORD, M.P., 0-2 THE COEA1MA CAMPA.W I STAkFORD, s.H 1 Last evening fr. Augustus Stafford, YLP., appeared be. fore a large audience at the Assembly-rooms in this town, to give an account of two e crieditions undertadrbia Z him to t'he Crimea in two su edi yearsviz. in :M and 1855-in which, s lie remarked, he foundat the sameplace and among the same people a state of things so utterly different. After a few preparatory observations, tie lecturer sa le shouldbegi his narrative at Marseilles, proceed thence to the Criniea, and then conducthis hearers to that $ace which had been the subject of so masny sympathioi- cutariL He embarked on the 2d of Septembec last at liaseilles, on board the Hecla, an English transport. with 760 Erench troops. Cholera was in the town -when they sailed, and eight hours afterwards it broke out among the troops on board. As they steamed southward the heat increased, and so didthe cholera. This large number oE men had been sent out without any medicine whatever. Not possessing the silent fortitude of English soldiers, their cries were most piteous.t'Ou reaching Mdalta, the staite of the ship was so horrible that he alnost determined to quit it; hut, at the urgent request of many poor sufferers, he was induced to stay with them. Cholera then began among the English sailors. After briely glancing at thedreadfiu ECenes which ensued before the close of the vovage the lecturer remarked that the Frenchtransport system is not, with al our faults, so good as our It was toldlhim by a French officer on board, and it had been confirmed indirectly by many persons who had op?Drtunitiesuof ascer. taining the same statistics, that the Isrench had-lost between July, 1854, and July, 1855-slain in hattle,-!left dead on the field, 12,000; died afterwards of wounds received in. battle, 7,000; senthome with loss of limb or "rdoken in constitution, 25,000; died of disease, chiefly diarhwcea, cholera, and dysentery, 60,000--total loss, about 105,000, exclusive of all who had been killed or died durim'g the last seven months. "But,"added hisinformant, "ie do not p Ut tbis in the nevwspapers; we only report a 1oSsof 20,000. Y5ou English Inow too much about your army ;'.we know too little." The hon. member then described Islakiava harbour, stating that he should think the bay was not above 400 acres in extent. The first view, he had of Sebastopol-he spoke as a civilian-mide him, wonder why our army did not advance and take it at once; and 10 minutes explanation from an artillery officer made him despair of taling it at all `He went through the town after it was taken, and he must say that the evidences of the civilization of Russia,-' judging from that town, nearly, if not fully, equalled anything in this country; and,thoughwe were atwarwithth6lRussians, he could not ride through Sebastopol 'without a sigh to see so many happy homesteads so utterly laid wasw It was trulysurprising to see the vast amount of earth wihich had been raised to the top of the ifamelon and of the 'Redan in the face of the enemy. This was as wonderfl to our enineers as it was wonderful to our Commissa.rit how the Russians been able tofeed so vast an armywiththeseasupply entirely cut off. Bearing these facts in mind, he must say he thought that history would award the glory to the defendersratherthanto the besiegers of &bastopoL Whilehe was standing near the Green-hill battery a cannon shot came by him, andit struck himthat it was likethe sound of crisp snow driven sharply over ice. The hon. member next described "that most miserable village of Balakalva," the infamous extortionspractised by Maltese, Ionian, and Itaiat stallkeepers in its streets, and the horrors of its hospital. wvhera he found surgeons quarrelling with orderlies, and orderlies -with surgeons, while their wretched patients diedL No arrangements were made for the embarcation of the siclc at Balaklava. Sometimes the French were obliged to carry down our sick to the shore; there were -not su_icient boats to embark them when they got to 'the shore, and when the transports came the unfortunate creatures had to lie on the hard boards until the sldn was worn off their joints by thefriction occasioned by the motion of the vesseL You might trace the course of these transports from Balaklava harbour to the entrance of the Bosphorus by the sLeletons of the miserable sick thrown overboard on the way. On arriving in the Bosphorns, owing to the insufficiency of accommodation, three or four days sometimes elapsed before the sufferers could be landed; -when they did land there were no arrangements for sup lying them with food, or for their reception in the hospi and, between one thing and another, he haid known them to be from 4 o'clock in the afternoon until 12 the next day without anything to eat. Altogether, so dire was the aspect of affairs at Scuturi that it seemed as if Heaven had forsaken us, and as if our sins had given us over to destruction. At this juncture came Florence Nightingale, and then order arose out of chaos. Our story brightened from the arrival of that lady there. He was at Scutari in the autumn of 1854, and then he saw the horrors which all had heard described, and which he would not attempt to describe again. He was there in the autumn of 18.55, and all was changed. Confusion hadgiven place 'so order, fil'h to cleanliness, the aggravation or neglect of erery human suffering to the mitigation of al tehe evils of war. -But there 'was one thing not changed. He found among our soldiers the same good feeling, tlhe same 'noble demeanonr, the same heroic spirit that he, had witnessed the year before. And there -was another thing, not changed; for in the samelittle room, with no luxuries and very few comforts, engaged in her ceaseless work-, there he found Florence.Nightingale. Consider.ing the difficalties3she had had to contend -with, she had been one of the few that had not disappointed England. He was in the French tent hospital at the front of the camp, and they owned that in the comforts and luxries supplied to the sick and -wounded thCy coulidno longer compete w;ith us. He asked Hiss Nightingale, "WVhat'do you; think of the soldiers now ?'> She said, *-*rhey have their faults, and those ho in their sevoral positions in life may feel that they have a little neglected the education of the lower orders will be the last to blame those brave men for the faults they do possess; but they respond to kindness and they recognize discipline, and, for ourselves, we have never heard from them one word or seen ene gesture that might 3ot have been fitted for the drawing-room. They have been to us, and to ail the ladies, gentlemen and Christians." He asked one poor fellow what bethought of Miss Nightingale, anddthe reply w&s-" Well, I hope she will go up to Heaven before she dies." After glancing at the brial place at Scutari, where as many as 80 corpses were occasionally consigned coffinless to the earth at one time, the hon. member concluded an eloquent and highly interesting lecture with a glowing tribute to the memory of the brave men who had so nobly fought and died for their country-themselves descendants of the heroes who foughtat Agincourt, at Blenheim, and at Waterloo. The lecture was listened to wvith niarked attention throughout, and frequently elicited heartyapplause.
AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS. TO THE EDITOR OF THIE T1WS. Sir,-As an occupier of land, Isaouldnot feel the least reiuctance to make-knovan the number of acres of-each kind of crop grown and the particulars of the stock on my farm. But if nothing more is to be done, I am at a loss to see the utilitv of this. And, if anything more is to bddone, would it not be desirable to consider -well what that is before putting the coentry to> a great expense and the farmiers to an infinity of trouble? A7 an argument in favour of the obtaininlg of stitiiticil agricultmral k;nowledge, a noble lord (Stanley of .Mderley} stated in Parliament that the crop of~ wheat of 1846 was sefling for5s, or nnder, per quarter, till Christmas of that year, vad in thefollowing sumner rose to 102s. Now, Sir, is it not evident, that if the number of acres had been ascertain,eAJto-tbesmaaliest fraction, the same irregularity of prices would have taken place? It was the deficiency per acre that ws unknown tll after Christmas. This is thegreat diflculty, and I see no plan proposed for discovering the weight of crop per acre, better than that adopted at present by those most interested mi the matternamely, taking the reports of-t,he leading armers, land' agents, &c., and collating them. If this vwas insufficient in 146, it is insufficient still. It is said that the :French Gbvernment have some means of ascertaining the amount of the crop, and haTe in consequenco been enabled on some occasions to supply their defciency from our markets at-the, expense of us poor ignorant English farmers and factors. It might naturally occur to most people except statisticians, that the reason the French discevered the deficiency before the English was owing to- their harvest being earlier ripe. If the rrench have any bettermethod of gettig this knowledge-which I don't believe-there cannot be any difficulty iu learniDg it from them. The object of my writing this is to point out that attempts. were made, many years- since, by a firm af Liverpool. to. obtain this informatiomby actual measurement, and at suchn an early part of the smnmeras to berealy usefuL. Messrs. Cropper, Benson, and Co., for, I believe, 17.years, sent an agent to certain great corn-growing districts just at the. commencement of harvest to measure smndl portions of, land, I think a square yard at each place, aud send theproduce to Liverpool, where it was rubbed ont and weighed. one of their partners, giving evidence before a PTrliamenu tary committee, said thatthey considered the produce of the harvegt was very a.ssustely ascertained by this method. As. this firm has long ceased to exist, I conceive' the surviving partners could not have the least objection to make known the exact method pursued and the results obtained-during the time they followed this pln; and, if it should seem.advisable,itmlghtbetried, with anyinodificationsor additions which might be thought desirable. It nmay,seem uncertain i aud liableto error, but at any rate it may, perhaps, be as good as the somewhat random guesses now- made, chiefly ;m appearance and we have the assuzance of those wVho, at ereat exonense. 1d it for a lon ,n,m rB t.h 1, thrvtbrn,w1, - - U it pretty accurate.

ZONDON, FJBIDAY, MARCH 21, 185. The greater part of mankind peruse with no 'very deep interest the congratulations that hail the domestic events of powerfiul and fortunate families. Envy is sure to have some place in the feelingm with which those on the common level regard the condition of the great, and envy extinguishea those sympathies which we can sometimes feel even for a ival or a foe.. No wonder, then, that- the language of congratulation should be almost extinct; that the foli; volumes of aaudia and lcius, to which all the choicest spirits of their used to contribute, are only taken down from the * Xhelvesof a public library to amuse a cynical taste; and that poet laureates refuse to be crowned till they I have been excused the burden of one ode a-year. Sovereignt, it is assumed, can take care - of themselves, andl need but smil :ympathy, either in weal Orin woe. It is difficult to regard them i.domestio, relations at all; or as finding their aphere either of pleaure or of duty in the ordinary occasions of life. But this apathy, this distance, though it affects to be natural and universali has no truth or sanctior; it is no more 16: be 'respected than the equal indifference with Which men regard the comdition of the great working.aAd aiiffering muititude; it is founded upon ignorance not only of historical truth but of r4atural lawvs.: The truth is that, disdain it as we will, the happiness of nations and of co.ntinents is, in, fact, bound up in the inci-. dents of particular families as much as in the character of individual men ; nor is it less a -truth that. princes are but men, and that when they have won or lost the game of empire,-when- a world is bringg them its homage or amob is seeking their lives,-ia their plnmiest hour, or in their darl;est, lind Nature- reasserts her, claim, and makes their joys aund. orows those of ordinary magrtas, caring most of all for wives, children, brothern, sisters, and dear friends. These affections onde implanted, power and glitter cannot crush them. Under the crown and rod of iron they hold their golden away; they modify the largest policy, and sometimes mitigate the harshest. The simple crowd that gapes on pomp is leas deoeived than the Politician who forgets either that princes are men or that their lives re history. If a style lcharacteristic and natuil be a proof of sincerity, it in -not wanting in any. one of the addresses published in the M.rniteur. The Euro. pean Congress,-by a happy coincidence assembled in the very palace where this event has talien place, sees in the consolidation of the NAPoLow dyna3ty a new pledge of safety and- confidence to the whole world. The President of the Senate quotes Gthotus, takes a prophetic survey of the French empire at the end of the 19th century, reverts to the crusades, glances at Africa, sees the reunion of the East and the West in the-projected canal of Suez, and evidently longs for the licence of verse to hail the infant PoLIo in suitable terms The LegislativeBodydwells more soberly, but not less earnestly, on the triumph of order and law, on the balance of power, and the interests of international equity reasserted in Europe. Everybody, in succession, has something to say, in which it could not easily have been anticipated, difficult as it may be to treat in a distinct way an event which has one meAning for alL We have already dwelt on the actual novelty and the various uncertainties of this event; that it is more than two centuries since a Sovereign of France was succeeded by his son; that, doubtless, to this singular fatality may be ascribed no small part of the misfortunes of the country; and that it is more than 40 years since the birth of an " Infant of France." That the child now- born shoulld live to fulfil the bright anticipations of its numerous well-wishers is a blessing almost too unprecedented to be prayed for; but in that novelty, in the misfortunes of the French throne and the French nation, in those defaults of lineage which have conspired so long and so miserably with the characteristic caprice of that excitable people, we see the reason for the earnestness of these prayers. Men do not pray for what is certain. They scarcely pray for what they think they can rely on. They pray for those things of which they havo hitherto been continually disappointed. It is true there are factions in France who cast their hopes elsewhere, who pray for the restoration of exiles, or of a republic. That only contributes to the interest of an event with so many consequences and such great uncertainties. The NA0ox,oN born last Sunday morning may be crowned the fourth of his line, alnd may reign more gloriously, more wisely, more beneficently than his piedecessors; or may add one more to the Pretenders of France. At this moment no one can doubt vhich way lies the interest of France and of Europe. That is the evident feeling of the addresses before us, and gives them an unmistakeable sincerity. The Ebr zon, on the other hand, speaks lik-e one within reach of a great destiny,which many others had forfeited. Mis replies are deeply marked with the lemsons of a gloomy experience, and their tone offers a striking contrast with that of a certain State elsewhere, which, in its youth and vigour, in the vastness of its territory, the increase of its population, and its unbounded wealth, defies fate to do its worst, and means to appropriate half the world. The imperial father gravely and sadly undertakes to imbue his son with the idea that nations must not be egotistical, and that the peace of Europe depends upon the prosperity of each nation. No one can object to the modest and reasonable sense in which the EMPaoR. continues the title of " lifant " of France," as the son of the whole country, the elect of the whole nation, the first citizen of the State, and the representative of the interests of all. He courageously looks back on the fate of those born in the same place under similar circumnstances. After forty years of MartyrdOM PBOVmDEOFC has mysteriouslyI brought his family and France to a similar occasion of hopes and thanksgiving. In 1856 we are brought baclk to the year 1811, and France aepa-tha birth of an heir to the dynasty of her choice. " But "1itorY' lt c r "h xa: lessons which he '. will 'never forget. It tells, on t,e one ." haind that we should never abuse the favours "of fortune; on the other, that a dynastv "hbs only a chance of stability when it { remains faithful to itz origin, and when it "occupies itself solely with the popular interests "for which it was created" There have been tin.a when such professions would hardly have. been believed, but at this momentno one doubts that theEmpaRor. wishes for anything rather than war, though it were ever so sucessful. His heart is in the material improvement of France, in the decoration of its fair capital, in the extension of its trade and commerce, and in all-that we call social progress. For the sake of this noble ambition, and that it may not pass away with bim, we join our praydrs to the rest, that the infant NAo.LEoi, born in a season of returning peace and prosperity, amid acts of clemency and universal greetings, may jorealz the unhappy spell which thwarted the course of so many of his predecessors, and live long a wise and good Emperor of France.
Whatever be the merits of tlhe do;ible. government of India, it seems neither favourable to enlightened legislation nor to just aiid righteous~ litigation. It is hardly possible within' the.limits allotted to us to give any idea of the insane con- fusion in which substantive law and judicial: pro- I cedure are alike involved throughout! the vast empire of India; and the case of the 4Wil of Mr. DycB SomBRE has shown that the EAst India 'Company are as little scrupulous as to what rights they defend or attack as careless by what courts they decide and by what laws they regulate the destinies of 150,000,000of thehumanrace.' We know not for how many years India has been left without any uniform criminal law, although a most elaborate and carefully prepared 'code has been made by Mr. MACAUL&Y and the able and eminent men who assisted him in his task. This code was bandied backwards and forwards from the Indian Government to the East IndiaCompany, from the . Company to the Board of Control, and from the Board of Control back again to India, till at last it has foulnd a resting-place in the new Legislative. Council of the enpire, which being composed of servants of the East India Company, has declared itself independent of its masters, and, by devoting two hours in the wek' to the revision of the work of Ir. M&c&uxr,&Y and. his associates, may hope, in the course of a few years, to produce a code of criminal law .not very inferior to that upon which it began. Iu the meanwhile another Commission, constituted under the provisions of the act of 1853, has been engaged in preparing a code of civil procedure, by which the amalgamation of the. Supreme Court3 established by act of Parliament with the Sudder Courts of India may be effected. ' The task was one of enormous difficulty, and was proposed to the Comnmission in. a letter from Sir CHAni.s WOOD, in which he lays down their duty to be to auialgamate the Supreme and Suddeir Courts, and to take such steps as are necessary preliminaries to such amalgamation. The principal of these steps was the *preparation of one uniform code of prooedur.e,applicable to; al the jurisdictions so. to. be amalgamated. Now, the Supreme Court adininsters legal, equitable, and ecclesiastical law, each with its separate system of procedure; and the Sudder Courts, or rather those courts from which they are the tribunal of ultimate appeal, must administer-as many different laws as the nationalities of the defendants, -1indoo, Mahomedan, Armenian, Portuguese, .French, Spanish, or Italian-through the medium of interminable written pleadings, under regulations devised, by the Comrpany. Hence it follows that *the problem submitted to the Indian Law Commissioners was of the most abstract'nature, being, in fi6t,; nothing.lea tlhan, thi,-how to-devis-3single system of pleading and prictice which should be adapted to every conceivable- variety of law, which should be equally applicable to the largest as to the smallest cause-for the English aerchiat in Calcutta, as well as for the ryot in the remotest corner of Bengal, and which should thus make the decisions of the highest court of appealuniversally applicable, and the proceedings of the highest court of original junrsdiction a pattern for those of the lowest. It is as if the Parliament of Great Britain were asked to frame a code of procedure which should administer in a uniform manner common law, equity, ecclesiastical law, Admiralty law, and the law over which the County Courts have jurisdiction. It is one of the highest and noblest problems which can occupy the human intellect, and one which, if rightly solved, must be of universal application, just 'as applicable to England as to India, and to any other country as to those. The problem was nothing less than to deternine on purely abstract grounds of jurisprudence the cheapest, the speediest, and the best means of conducting a legal contest from its commencemeut to its conclusion. Thia problem these Commissioners, among whom we find the names of the Cmxv JusTie: of the Common Pleas, the.31sTtSt of the RoLLs, and Sir EDwARD RYAN; late Chief Justice of India, believe that they have- solved. WVe earnestly invite the attention of all those wh1 take an interest in law reform to the question"YWhether they have solved this problem or no Ti for either the labours of these eminent men aid their coadjutors are a ridiculous failure, or they have carried-the science of practical jurispru-: deuce to a point far beyond that w-hich it has ever yet reached, and conferred, by so doing, an inestimable benefit on the human race. It is unfortunate that these purely abstract labours have been mi-xed up with the duty of suggesting the elements of which the new High Court, as the Commissioners call the tribunal which is to arise from the amalgamation of the Supreme and Sudder Courts, is to consist. While they are engaged in abstract speculation the unanimity of the Commissioners is remarkable; but as soon as they'reach matters of practical and political importance, such as " Whether a native "ought to be admitted to a seat in the Eligh "Court ?"-a discrepancy of opinion has made itself manifes, which is sure to be used to discredit the really important part of tho labours of the Commission,-that is, their scheme of practice and procedure. Without embarrassing ourselves, then, with disputes on political topics, or with the proposed organization of the courts devised by the Commission, we propose to call attention to those portions of the reeommendations of the Commission which are universally applicable, and, if true, ought to be adopted in England as well as in India. It is proposed, then, that every suit should be commenced by a summons, to be obtained on the application of the plaintiff, and to contain the relief which he seeks, or the cause of his action. On the sumnons are to be endorsed directions as to what the defendant is to do in case he admits or dlenies all or any part of the plaintiff's claim, and the summons is also to state whether it be for the final disposal of the case or only for the settlement of the issues. Supposing the cause to be disputed, the plaintiff and defendant are to appear before the judge, either in their own persons or by their agents, and the judge will then proceed to examine the parties so appearing according to the exigency of the summons-that is,: either for the purpose of settling the issues or for finally disposing of the case. It will be the duty of the judge to hear the statements of the parties appearing before him, to see in what they differ, to inspect the documentary evidence which they shall produce, to call other witnesses, if he shall deem them necessary, and, from the general result of such examination, to ascertain the point, whether of fact or law, upon which, they are at issue. . If there be no disputed point of fact or law, the judge may at once decide the case; if there be any dispute of fact or law, he shall fix a day for hearing the issues, when the fact shal be proved-by evidence or the law argued before him; or, if the exigency of the summons be for an immediate decision, he shall proceed to decide the question of fact or law at once. We make no apology for troubling our readers with these dry and abstract details, for they seem to us to comprehend in a small compass a principle of the utmost fruitfulnessancd importance. Toabolishwritten pleadings altogether and to substitute for them, as the first step in the cause, the appearance of the parties face to face in the presence of the judge, and that by a procedure so flexible and plastic as to include alike the- despatch necessary for small demands and the deliberation required for weightier disputes, ia a plan at once original, bold, and simple, Affording some hope for the administration' of substantial justice and of relief from endless. delays and technicalities. The first duties of the judgawill thus be those of a court of conciliation, and in the' vast majority of cases we believe that the first' interview will also prove the last. The opinion thrown out by a person of undoubted learning and thorouglhly disinterested will nip litigation in the bud, and prevent the possibility of men being fedl on by the -representations of interested professional advisers to support untenable cases, and waste their substance in carrying on, for the benefit of those advisers, protracted and hopelea litigation.
In the third series of estimates for the Civil Service, which has lately been printedX and.which relates exclusively-to- the charges for "' Law and "3.Justice," the most interesting items of expenditure are those required for the police and penal establishments of. the country. We do mot very much care to learn, year after year, that one clerk of the CRoww gets double the salary of his junior, that the fees of counsel amount to so much, what a gown-keeper earns, what a bagbearer nets, and what is the worth of a nesseiigeres, charwoman's, or a housekeeper's appointment. Most of these are fixed charges, which we examine once for all, while the expenses of our police, and still more of our penal establishments, are fluctuatinog, and represent, if not the amount of crime in the country, at all events the cost of our various expedients to check it. From this point of view the: present series, of estimates is the most interesting of any that have yet been published, and appeals to the sympathies of every,-man who has a spark of public. spirit,. The. coat of collecting the' revenue may attract the notice of economists, and the expenses-.of our public departments may excite the: attention of Administrative Reformers; but we are not all economists, and Administrative Reformers are now always sure of an audience. Every man, how. ever, in the country who has a sixpence in his pocket for a beggar to ask or for a thief to steal comes into direct contact with the sources of crime, and he must be either very callous or very stupid if, in this London especially, he is not compe7led almost at every turn and every crossing to think of our criminal; populationhow it is formed and how we are to deal with it; or, if he does not approach the question in this hearty way, looking at a great social. cvil with a benevolent eye, he will assuredly do so in a small plebeian fashion, by sneering at the policeman as he passes his door, the terror of urchins, the admiration of housemaids, and the envy of bakers' apprentices. The estimate for the police fornmp part of the general law charges- of- England and, Ireland,, Scotland paying for its own constab-dlary. These law chargex for the~ three kingdoms uamunt to 1,350,7091., or 22,0001. more than last year, the increase being chiefly incurred by the police. It will not, however, be supposed that the above sum includes all the expense3 of our law courts; there is a further sum of nearly 400,0001. chargeable on the Consolidated Fund. The proportions ini which this vote is distributed to the three kingdoms will at firt might surprise one. The total estiniate for England is only 470,0001. ; for Scotlaud it is only 135,000. ; vwhile forIrdland aloneit is 745,0001. The larg' sum required for the sister island is due to the fact that, besides a grant of 35,000!. for the Dublin police, 639,0001. is required for the Irish constabulary. In England the charge for police is confined to the metropolis, and the sum required is one-fifth of that required for Ireland. The expense of the metropolitan police-courts for the ensuing year is calculated at 29,0001. This is exclusive of 28,0001., the salaries of 23 police magistrates, whichi are charged on the Consolidated Fund, and it ineludes the salaries of 23 clerks, of 51 ushers, gaolers, and messengers, rent, coals, and other small items, together with the cost of the Polike xzette, which is 3,6881. The charge for the police force itself is 415,0001., of which 102,0001. is to be voted by the House of Commons, the rest of the expense being defrayed by parish rates and by those departments which require the services of the force. From public departments alone is obtained in this way 21,5001.; from public companies and private individuals is obtained 3,9001. ; and the theatres contribute 3241. The force consists of 5,807 persons, who receive pay amounting to 314,5001., besides clothing, that amounts to 34,3001., and other benefits,-coals, for example. -The coals supplied to sergeants, constables, and police stations cost 6,1601., 401b. being given 'weekly to each married man all the year, and an average of 301b. weekly to each single man. Truncheons, rattles, and swords cost 401., and the funeral expenses of police constables, 200a. Tho pay of each individual varies from 501. upwards. More than half the whole force, or 3,493, get only 491. 8s., while 1,500 get 51. more. The pay of a sergeant varies from 631. to 811., by far the greater number getting only the former sum. The pay of inspectors varies from 811. to 2001., the majority receiving 1181. In Ireland the remuneration is on a lower scale, and begins as low as 241. The great mass of the constabulary receive only 271. 14s. a-year. While our law charges are raised for the coming year chiefly through the increased expense of police, the prison and convict services require 11,0001. less than in the previous estimates. The expenses of transportation, for example, are, as might be expected, not half what they were last year. Last year the estimate was 59,0001.; this year it is 25,0001. In the same way the expenses of the convict establishments in the colonies are 286,0001., or 11,0001. under the estimate of last year; while, on the other hana, the Government prisons and convict establishmaents at home become more expensive in almost the same proportion. Last year they cost 375,4001. ; this year they are set down for 40,0001. additional. It is one consolation, howrever, to find that, in spite of all the diiculties into which the abandonment of the old system of transportation has thrown us, there has been a saving of several thousand pounds. The victualling of the prisons alone is to cost 11,0001. mnoro tain lasRt year. Tn the%e it may be observed' that the cost of feeding each inmate vanies considerably in the different establishments. In the Perth-prison it is as low as 71. is. a-year for each; in the Portland prison it is as high as 12t1 lOs. for each. At all the-prisons for females the charge is 81. for each ;it is so at mlibank, where the charge for male convicts is 91. The clothing for prisoners varies equally. At Millbank the rate for male convicts is 55s. annually; for femajes only 40s. At Newgate tho cost is 22s. 6d. ; at Portsmouth and Chathan it is highest of all-7&s. It is true that 121. lOs. for victualling each one of 1,500 prisoners appears not to be an extravagant sum, but it may be extravagant when compared with the 7?. is. of Perth, the 81. of Brixton, or the 91. of Newgate. In themselves these items may not be very interesting, yet, indicating as they do not simply the cost of crime, but also the amount of luxury enjoyed by the prisoner in his confinement, they open np questions that are really momentous.
LATEST INTELLIGENOE. FRANOR The Moniteur of yesterday publishes the follow-: ing.- " The Emperor has had a report drawn up of the number of, and circumstances connected with, the political exiles in Algeria or in foreign countries. " After the events of June, 1848, 11,000 persons were sentenced under the Republic to transportation to Algeria; by the clemency of the President that number was reduced to 306. "In December, 1851, 11,201 persons were trans. ported or banished. The pardons granted by the Emperor have reduced that number to 1,058 "On the occasion of the birth of the Prince Imperial, His Majesty has decided that. permission to return to France shall be granted to all those who wRill aake a declaration to submit loyaly to the government the nation has selected, and who will give their word of honour to respect! its laws. Aready at the inaug,uration of the empire this generous appeal was made; 'the!? Emperor aa ordered it to be repeated.

THE ARMY IN TEE CRIMEA. CAIO BEFORE SEBASTOPOL )IRcu 3. (FY ODUR OWN . I1 have more than once had to&-remark that there is a much larger proportion of sBilcnem in the Land Transport CoTps than in the rest of the army. I am not acquainted with the exact number of men in the corps, but, taking it at 7,000, which is probably rather over than under the mark, the amount of sickness must have been very considerable for there to be, as there was a short time ago,> a difference of nearly, or quite, one per cent. in the average mortality of the w-hole army according as the LAmd Transport was included or excluded. The mortality of the army has been 4 per cent., and of the army including the land Transport Corps 5 per cent., or thereabouts. It is evident that, owing to the nature of their duties, the Land - Transport men are likely to be less healthy iat this ,season than the soldiers of infantry regiments. The latter have little to do, except take care of themselve3. Their turn' of gaard comes once in 15 or 20 days. They have just a pleasant and healthful amount of exercise; when put upon ftatigue duty they by no means exhaust themselves by the -violence of their exertions. The la'nd Transport men, on the other hand, have constant and hard work, and, no matter how bitter the cold, how heavy the rain, - it must be done, for the supply of the army depends upon it. In the worst weather yon see them following their toilsome vocation, going down to Balaklava for stores, into the Redan for wood, across to Eazatch for something else. They are particularly liable to frostbite when harnessing, driving, and riding, and often wet through for houra together, or plunged to their knees in mud while extricatingtheircarts from some piece of deep ground. Strong, hardymen are required to bear up against such exposures and fatigue'i Unfor- tunately, littlepainsappearto havebeen taken tose. - cure such. One is struck by the youth and apparently feeble frames of many of the LaDd Transport men one meets in camp and on the roads, and it is well known to the surgeons that a bad class of men (baA as regards their physical strength and condition) hag obtained admittance into the corps-men who would not be accepted as recruits in an infantry regiment of the line. MIere lads, of weakly constitution, are doing work which would tax the srength ana powersof endurance of robustadults-attempting to do it, I should rather say, for most of them soon sicken under the effort. I know of instances of recrits of this class who, having come out iu.November and December, have been nearly the whole time in hospital, and are now at Scutari, whence they will very probably be invalided home.; Other causes concur to fill the hospitals with men belonging to this branch of the service. The sites of some of the camps are ill-choser. and difficult to drain; in others the drainage has not been sufficiently attended to; heaps of manure are allowed to aocumulate; some of the huts are overcrowded and insufficientlyr ventilated. Considering the short time that has elapsed sinoe the new organization of the corps commenced, great progress has certainly been made, andl cauhave been achieved only by zeiaous and constant exertion on the part of Colonel Wetherall and his officers; but the utmost exertions of the best officers, maost desirous to get their corps into good worling condition, must be unavailing to correct the original bad quality of the recruits, the 'evil of which, while the army is stationary here, is triffing compared to what it might become on the march or in the field. Blost serious results Might ensue in a campaign from an ill-manned Land Transport, sickening by dozens daily. This matter of recruits houlda be looked to at home. As regards required improvement of ventilation, drainage, removal of manure, &c., these points will doubtless be attended to as soon as possible by the DirectorI General of the corps and the commandants of divi- sions. The Land Transport Corps will probably be among the la'st to leave the Crimea, should peace be made; and it is not too much to suppose that, in any case, it will be here' all spring, and perhaps part of the summer. The sun has already acquired considerable power, and a -ery few weeks, or even days, may bring on weather in which the evils of crowded huts, damp, and dung-heaps WM befar more sensibly felt than in t'he present compartively wintry season. Every effort should be made to guard against fever, which otherwise will assuredly supervene. Accounts from Kertch from trustworthy and impartial sources are highly satisfactory. Healthy a, this army has been during the winter, the Turkis Contingent has far surpassed it in that important particular, and this is attributed raiuly to the great sobriety of the men. They havE been hard-worked; the amount of fortificatior they have thrown up is described to me by eye-witnesses as quite surprising ; but not a man was inva. lided in three months, and up to the end of 18SE. the average of sickness was barely i per cent. Thern has been no cholera at all. During the last threx months of 1855 there were but 92 deaths in thc Contingent, which iS upwads of 16,000 men strong exclusively of the cavalry and of the dep0ts on thi Bosphorus. This year scurvy has appeared amon4 the Turks, attributable to an insufficient supply o vegetables, lime juice, &c., but, although -widel' spread, it is not severe, and measures were promptl tak-en on the discovery of its existence to give th men the sort of food the deficiency of 'which ha brought it on. Among the British troop at Kertch there has been no scurvy. Th Contingent's hospitals are very good, and the Turk have the most perfect confidence in their Englis doctors-a confidence dating from last summet when the cholera was among them at - Bujukd6r camp. The soldiers of the Contingent are generall large, muscular, robust men; their telkiperance I remarkable. They are contented, docile, and seen to like their officers. There are about 150 Turk-i cavalry at Kerteh, -whose appearance is good an -their condition efficient. It is well kno-wn tha in the unfortunate slirmish in which 3ajo Shorwood lost Iiis life they behaved most gal lantly against very superior numbers. Not withstanding all the calumnies that have been pro pagated against the Turkish Contingent, its General and its officers, there can be no question that th experiment, as far as it has yet gone, has bee, completely successfuL And there can hadly be; doubt that if they had to take the field thes 16,000 Tuirks, well led, would fight as gallantly a did their countrymen at Silistria and at Nars. Including English officers of the Contingent clerks, servants, the detachment of the lOth Hussars &c., there is a Protestant coDgregyation at Kertch o about 500 souls. Service is performed in the oft mentioned building, which was a ladies' school and is now a cavalry barrack. By w,2d 0 experiment, it was once performed in the Kertc] Cathedral. The Russian priest's permission wa asked, and he made not the slightest difficulty, an( attended himself, as did a large numbei of the inha bitants, to 'witness the service. The building, how ever, was not found convenient, and the barra& were returned to. The Russian priest is an auiabl, and enlightened man, and his heart was won by tin establishmnent by the Rev. Mr. Boudier, who fo] two months officiated as chaplain at Kertch, of I school for the Russian children. The expenses o, this establishment are defrayed out of a fund raise6; by rates levied on canteenmen and certain classes ol shopkeepers, and the favourable-' impression it hae raade upon the people is remarkable. The good understanding betiveen the Englisg , chaplain and the Russian priest was perfect, and -hen the former left, about a nionah ago, the lajtt
O THE EDITOR OF THE TIfES. Sir,-Permit me to observe, in answer to Lord Lichfield's statement, that Captain Anson is not gone out to India as a paid aide-de-camp to General Anson, that I never said he was. I said that the United Service Gazette of Saturday last announced that he was abbut to sail for India as Aide-deCamp to the Commander-in-Chief; and I am certain that, whetever may be his position on arriving, paid or unpaid,. Lord IAchfield will not deny that his brother has quitted the Rifle Brigade and exchanged into the 84th Foot for the express purpose of obtaining, as soon as his uncle can arrange it, the many very great advantages, pecuniary and professional, connected with a staff appointment in India. The A 77njy Lit shows that Captain Anson did not join the service companies of the Rifles in the Crimea until 19 months after he first entered the army. His brother states that, after a service of six months in the East, he was brought home to join the new battalion at Aldershott, and that I amthereforeirierror in stating that he exchanged from the Crimea into the 4t: About the time Captain Anson appears to have returned home the second battalion of the-Rifle Brigade wls so short of officers from deaths, sickness, and absentees on Staff appointinents, that some of its companies were actually in cbarge of boys who had not joined the service above six or seven months. I did not therefore suppose it possible that on such an emergency-at such a moment (for, be it recollected, neither of the assaults on the Redan had at that time taken place)-the Horse Guards would have still further weakened that regiment by ordering home one of its few officers who had had a chance of learning his business, and had health to stand the work. And I do not see that in the midst of such a terrible war there was any very material difference between accepting an appointment in India from the Crimea or from England, it being a certainty that if the war endured every available officer and man we had at home would be hurri-ed out to the East the very moment they were fit for service. As I had the Army List by my side at the time I stated that Captain Anson had obtained both his steps, instead of one, by purchase, I must apologize for that involuntary and, I am happy to think, utterly unimportant error. In conclusion, I wiU beg Lord Lichfield to believe that persons who, like myself, view the manner in which the good things of the service are invariably jobbed away with apprehension and disapprobation, and who are exerting ourselves' as far as -we can to puta stop to it, are not entirely urged ton,_ as he appears to think, by evil motives; and that it is. just possible we may be actuated by a sincere desire to improve the efflciency of our army, and to give to all classes of our oilicers a fair share of the prizes of their profession according to their deserts, and not according to. their political or social influence and connexion. In Captain Anson's case an appointment which would have been a fair object of ambition and reward to some deserving officer of the British army in India, shut out, as it has been, from all the promotion incidental to the Crimean war,- has been appropriated to a young man who has seen but six ~nonths' foreign service, imported from Europe expresslyto fill it. The Horse Guards have sanctioned and facilitated the transaction by allowing him to exchange into a regiment which he will prbbably never join, but which will, in consequence, lose the services of one of its captainS, and the country will. have to bear, at the very moment whert she can least afford to bear it, the expense of bringing tAe one officer to.Europe and sending the otl-er to India, and the loss of both their services during the transit, -I am, Sir -your obedient iervant A TAXPAYER.
: I I TUR,KEY. (FRom ouiR owkHo6RMobf- CONSTANTINOPLX, XMAca 10. This is a time of respite for the Turkish Givernment. The opening of the conferences has rivetted public attention, and pary spirit is, if not silent, at least less active than usual; it is gathering strength anid waiting for the result of the conferences. Meanwhile the Ministry is employing its time in councils and discussions about the establishment of a bank. I told you in one of -my former letters that there are numerous projects proposed daily. ' I With such a large field for commercial enterprise as Turkey will offer after the war, the greater the number of private banks, the more rapidly her resources will be developed. But the first step in Turkey, as well. as in every other country which is only, beginning to, develope its material resources, is to concentrate all its efforts by creating a national establishment of this kind. This is, I think, the object of the councils and discussions held at present. Several of the leading merchants and bankers have been summoned by the MiSnister of Finance to give their opinion on the subject. The chief danger to be incurred in the creation of such an establishment is, that it might become a good job for the benefit of a few individuals, like the attempt made some years ago when the Govermment granted privileges to a few houses who gave only their names and shared the profits, while the vhole expenses and risks were borne by the Goveiument. The o.ject of this bank was to Leep the rate of exchange doiwn, and, like all such forced financial operations, it ended in failure. The only safeguard against this danger is to make such a bank of credit a national and not a Government establishment, and to afford the greatest possible facilities for native capital to have an interest in it. I alluded some time ago to the large amount of dead c:apital in Turkey which could be thus made profitable. The death of Hall Pasha, the Sultan's brother-in-law, which took place last week, may serve as a proof of this. He had been repeatedly employed in high offices, especially as Minister of Marine, which affords, perhaps more than any other post, facilities for making a fortune, and he has left behind him 18,000,000 of piastres in ready money alone; and yet Ha7 Pasha was more anxious than any other Turk not to let his money lie idle, as one may see from the circumstance that his daily revenue from houses in Galata and landed property is valued at 9,000 piastres. I told you in my last of the endeavours made by the English and, I hear, by the French Ambassador also, to get Omer Pasha, the Governor of Roumelia, removed from his post on the charge of peculation. I have since inquired into the antecedents of this gentleman, which throw a curious light on. the administrative system of Turkey. He was recently governor of the province of Kurdistan, where, together with the Defterdar, he pursued a wvholesale system of exaction and robbery, which did at least as much as Russian intrigue to drive the Kurds into open rebellion against the Porte. In spite of the powerful protection which he enjoyed at Constantinople he was recalled, as well as the Defterdar and Az Odassi. The highest tribunal took- steps to prosecute him for his misconduct. All the papers were ready when his powerful protectors succeeded in having him appointed to the governorship of Roumelia which put practicaJly an end tothe inquiry and enabled him to follow up his- former disreputable career. What is the use of proclaimigog every year that corrupt officials will be punished if the Government itself protects the offenders in the face of the most glaring facts? It is a simple mockery. Examples are required, and not in the usual style, when men convicted of having committed the grossest abuses are sent for a short time into some pleasant spot in the Archipelago, or to the baths of Broussa, until the storm has blown over, and then are recalled and placed in a better situation than before. A criminal who is guilty of murder has a chance even now to be condemned to death or to rot in prison, but the Pasha who has brought down misery on a whole province, and caued, as in the case of Omer Pasha, the deaths of hundreds, is sure to escape. In all things the Turks go into extremes. Formerly too many heads were cut off; now there are too few; verily, if one sees the consequences of this system of false and interested philanthropy, one would be inclined to wish back the times when paahas' heads were no uncommon sight on the gates of the seraglio, and dishonest bakers ran a fair chance of having their ears nailed to their owndoors. - The divided command which seems to follow the Eastern war like an evil genius makes itself felt in the smallest things as well as in the largest. The port of Constantinople forms no exception. "What with a Turkish harbour-master, several admirals, tand as many military authorities, everybody does as he likes. That the police regulations of the port are, under these circumstances, wretched need scarcely be mentio'ned. Lately a gang of sailors have begun to avail themselves of this state of things, and carried off systematically bales and cases from' the quays. Three nights ago three of; the gang, having taken away from the Custom-house quay a bale of goods, tried to carry it off in a boat, which was likewise not theirs. They were, however, seen by the Turkish guard and pursued. When they saw that they could not escape they went alongside the Vestal-a steamer lately bought by the Thessalian Mining Company-and, leaving bale and boat behind, they acrambled on board. The Turkish guard was soon after them, but when they tried to get up, one of the fugitives took up a broken grindstone and threw it down into the boat, killing one of the Turkish boatmen. The chief officer of the steamer,who heard the noise, came on deck, with'the steward, both atmed with revolvers, and asked the intruders what they wanted. They pretended to be pursued by some Turkish soldiers, who had threatened to kill them, andlasked the chief officer to assist them. The latter, although le knew nothing of what had happened, thought the thing rather suspicious at tnat hour of the night (about 11 o'clock), and ordered them to be gone,'threatening to shoot them if they refused. At this-the fugitives ran up on the padd4boxes, whence they jumped on board another steamer alongside, and thence to a third-the Austrian Lloyd steamer; there they found a boat lowered, got into it, and went off. The chief officer of Lthe Vestal having got rid of the intruders, and not hearing any further noise, went down' to his cabin, and it was only next day that the whole thing was explained, when he was mmoned to give his evidence, and was informed that a Turkish boatmen had been killed. The strangest thing seems to be that the companions of the ldlled man did not attempt to come on board the steamer; they were afraid as' it was an English steamer. This is just the curse of the separate jurisdiction in 'the port. The Turkish guard is afraid to interfere, in order not to come in collision with the foreign authorities. A great movement of troops has taken place here lately. Several thousand men have passed through from malta, and all the convalescents have been sent up likewise from Scutari, so that the Crimean army has got a considerable addition. A regiment of Bashi-Bazouks has arrived here from Adcianople; four others from Shiulla 'are likewise expected. The two Crimean mails arrived at the same time. i The last mail was detained by bad weather at Kamiesch. The telegraphic wira across to Scutari has been broken lately;, the necessary orders have ;been, however, given for its reparation, and a-boat put at the disposal of Captain Spurvey, R.A., for the purpose. The accident has been caused by a vessers anchor. I wrote in my last that Ismil PIasha (of Xalafat celebrity) has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the army of Anatolia. General Kmety will axcompany him, it is, I think, not yet decided whether as Chef d'tat Major or as commander of a division. The choice is very good. Isnil Pasha is one of the few Turkish commanders who is inoraly as well as physically brave, and who does not shrink from responsibility. Although he has not enjoyed a military education, he is an intelligent man, capable of forming his own ideas. If General' Kmety is attached to him, he wvil1 have a professional and experienced soldier at his side capable of making suggestions. The great thing is, that the army of Anatolia will have a head, the want of which was its chief fault. Omar Pasha is still at Trebizonde. He is expected here; and probably Ismail Pasha will not go before he arrives, as they don't pull together. The French have been going on a little better in their hospitals for the Lsat two days. M. Baudens, the Inspector-General of all the Hospitals, has left for the Crimea. He carried with him a letter from Miss Nightingale to M1arshal Felissier, in which she offers, as a private gift, portwine, lime-juice,- beef tea, and bedding for the French hospitals in the Crimea.

Fourth anthem aiah, 63d cl:apter, 1st verse)-" Who is this that comieth from E dom 1" The following prayer, composed for the occasion, was then read "0 Lord. the Sovereignof the world, we acknowledga that Thineis the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majeety; forall that isin the heaven andinthem eathis Thine. Thine is the kingdom, 0 Lord, and Thou art exalted as Head above all,; both riches andhonourcome of Thee, andThoureignestovera l.

All which we beg for the sake of Jesus Christ our most blessed lord and Saviour, to whom with Thee and the H6ly Ghost be all honour and glory, world without end.

V. Povah, and the Rev. J. Antrobus. The gentlemen of the Chapel Royal present were Messrs. Benson, Bradbury, Francis, Barnly, Machin, Shoubridge, Bucldand, and H. Barnly. Mr. Turle presided at the organ. The Lord Bishop of Oxford having been summoned to the Confimation of her Royal Highness the Princess Royal at Windsor Castle, yesterday, his Lordship was unable to distribute the Royal Mtagndy in person as Lord High Alnoner.
THE AssyiBiT EXCAVATIoNs. .The public are to be congratulated upon the safe arrval of about 100 tons of sculpture from the yrian eixcavations, which are considered the finest specimens of that art hitherto found, baving been brought home by Messrs. S. Lynch and Co. in the Christiana Carval. There has been much anxiety about these interesting relics in consequnce of the los sustained by the Ftench nation of a mnuch larger quantity, which was sunk near Ghorrah on the Euphrates by the Arabs last year. The same vessel also brings home two living lions from Southern :Babylon, procured by Mr. S. Lynch when there, whish, we are inormed, will be presented by Alderman Finnis to the Zoological Gardens, Regent's Park.

FRANCE. (nFOM Ou OWN'CORRESPONDENT.) PARIS, WEDITESDAY, M&Acn 19, 6 P.M. Addresses of congratulation to the Emperor colltinue to pour in. The following is from the Imperial Court of Pais:- " Sire,-The Inperial Court of Paris brings to the foot of the Throne its congratulations and its joy. Providence, in responding to the prayers of the Emperor, gives to tho present the security of the future. The Inperial dynasty is strengthened. France may henceforth repose tranquil and confident under the shelter of the great name of Napoleon. May the august child, the object of so much love for all truly French hearts, grow up in the virtues which have made his race the strength and glory of the country." That from the lMunicipal Council of Lyons is as follows,- "Sire,-Providence, which so visibly protects your Majesty, bas just conferred on you a favotur the most grateful to your heart, and the most precious to France. Of all the cties of the empire, Lyons is perhaps the one which owes the inost to your glorious dynasty. During nearly a century it has never been completely exempt from civil disturbanc s except* when under its shield. It therefore accepts as a blessing from Heaven everything that consolidates and perEpetuatesthe power of your august family. Permit us, Sire, to be the faithful interpreters of the sentiments of the people of Lyons, in laying at your feet, and at those of the Mwpre the most loyal congratulations and the assurance of tie most respectful devotion." Thle Municipal Council of Bordeaux thus exjresses itself " Sire,-YourMaiesty has saved France. You have di. rected her strength towards industry, commerce, and the arts-youhave just added bywar a noble gem to yourcrown 'of glory, and the vwsdom of yourpolicy, by removing old naionl prejudices, will have re-estblished the balance of per in Europe. Providence, in giving your Majesty a son, rewards you for all the good yoL have effected. Accept, &Me, the respectful congratulations of theMunicipal Council of 3Bordeaux. God, who protects France, and who guides you so visibly, will listen to our desires, and will guide this child in the glorious path opened by his father. After bAring constituted the joy and pride of his august mother, the Prince Imperial will continue your labour of civilization and progress. He will bear, like you, Sire, a maue which will never perish. We are, with the most profound respect, Sire, the most humble and obedient servants of your Maiesty." Sinilar addresses have been presented by the Imperial Courts of Pau, Metz, Dijon, Besangon, Caen, Montpelier, Poitiers, Toulouse, and Bourges; also by the Municipal Councils of Versailles, Metz, Toulouse, Amiens, Poitiers, Bourges, and Aignon; by the Conseil d'Amirautd; by the Marine Prdfet and the persons employed in the maritime departmnent of Brest ; by the Consulting Committee of the Colonies; and by the clergy of the see of Verdun. A decree in the Moniteur promotes Generals Randon, Canrobert, and Bosquet to the rank of Marhshal of France; Generals of Brigade Walsin-Eaterlisy, Gagnon, d'Hngnes, Jusuf4 and L. J. Walsin- :sterhazy to the rank of General of Division; and Colonels Louis Devilliers, Daulomieu-Beauchamp, de l'Abadie d'Aydren, Edgar Ney, and cleury to that of General of Brigade. By a decree in the Moniteur M. A. Fould, 31inister of State, and Admiral Eamelin, Minister vf 3ariine, have been promoted to therank of Grand Crosses of the Legion of Honour. Admiral Penaud, Commander-in-Chief of the Baltic Naval Division, has left Paris for Brest. The telegraphic despatch announcing the birth of the Imperial Prince caused an extraordinary sensation at Marseilles. All the vessels in the two }3abours, foreign as well as }rench, were in an inAtant sdressed with flags. The port of La Joliette in particular presented the most picturesque aspect. ale Caradoc steamer, of the English Royal Wavy, distinguished herself by the richness and variety of her colours, among which the fag of France occupied the place of honour. At night the entire city 'was spontaneously illuminated. The next morning the Bishop of MIarseilles, accompanied by his clergy, proceeded to the Chapel of 3otre Dame de la Garde, and blessed a large gold medal, which is to be offered ay thle clergymen attached to that sanctuary to the imperial Prince. A etter from Jassy (Moldavia), of the 3d instant, says:_ " The results of the conferences of Constantinople have produced in our country the most painful impression. We expect nothing less than fresh aggressions on the part of 2urkey on our andenLt treaties, and its usual disdain for the pryers of 5,000,000of Roumains. TheBoyards areaccused 'of being divided among themselves, but on this occasion, at least, they have proved that the interests of their country lave silenced the spirit of party. They agreed 'with each other on what was to be done, and went at once to consult with Prince Ghika. The Prince approved their conduct, 3nd declared that if the nation addressed a protest to him be should communicate it to the allied Powers, and a commission of Boyards was named to proceed to Paris to -defend before the Congress the rights of the country, and to jprotet in its namne against the propositions of Turkey. The same day the national protest was signed by all the clergy and the Boyards, and was communicated to the Consuls at Jassy. despite the earnest remonstrances of the Austrians. The deputation were on the point of leaving for Paris when the Prince received a finnan from the Sultan against any movement or any demonstration in opposition to the wishees of the Sublime Porte. The firman of his Highness, lackedby Austrian bayonets, has disconcerted every one. Weare now, indeed, an object of derisior. to the Greeks, for -our sympathy for the allies and for our blind confidence in Turkey; and we know not 'what answer to give 'when they Say to Us in the streets, 'It is still to Russia that you will- be forced to have recourse in the long lun.' We are, as you see, in the most critical situa *ion possible. On one side Turkey overwhel=s us in recomCiPense for our devotion to her; on the other hand Austria stifles our cries of distress, and the Ambassador of lFC&MeaeaPPrs to have acquiesced in our condemnation. Our last hope is in the decision of the conferences of Paris, which, if not quite in conformity with our wishes, may at least be more equitable and more in harmony with our ancient treaties. Our countrymen now in Paris are alone c Oged to speak in the name of the Roumain nation, and -btsw rhe"O epresentatives of the allies the union of t;?ZP2h Cij).Liti-the only reform capable of raising us our rsescntcondition, and of enabling us to realize Ie epewtations of the Western Powers-namely, that of #rWnbiug a strong barrier against the invasions of the following petition has been addressed. to the PWte relative to the MIoldavian frontier Oa the eve of the important conferences which are to regulate, in Paris, the general conditions of peace, anzd to i,.., by anew and definitive settlement of the frontier in the E st, the repose and security of Europe, we address ourselves with confidence to the benevolent protection of the 8ultan, our august Sovereign, humbly expressing to hiin our wishe, in order that he may promote their realization, which is not less important to the common interests of the gr-. European family than to the privataadvantage of Mol. davit. According to the first article of the Austrian proposiNons,- Acceptted byPussia, that poweris to surrenderthepor. Slo1 of t4e territory of Bessarabia beginning at Chotyin ancd foO2wsiile line of mountains as far as Lake Sasik. We tvk*14m% Ub*y-tio observe that the mountains therein ment i:e1a succession of lo0w hil, which become still itsas tbey approach the southt, where they decline into a~' en~a' marshy plain, without any natural b&undary, f(5rtior obstacle calculated to serve as the bas of de-. iedibooQeRions Such a fronxtie;r, which a great military 'ow - couild vrith diilculty defenud, would offer but - llu. xive Pwotection to a feeble State like Moldavia, and would Dot even admit of the establishment of a Customs line. But, indopendentlyofthee reasons, of which it appears impostible toquestiontbecorrectness,amoregrayeandimportsantconsido- ration,involvinga question of high morality, appearstousto point out tho Dnifeter, our former limit, as the only prudent,; rational, and political solution that can be arriyed at. Bessarabia, an integral portion of Moldavia, wa violently separated from it by the-treaty of Bucharest in 1812, to be' incorporated with the Russian empire. Nevertheless, by the convention of 1512,-entered into bySelim II.,of glorious memory, with Bogdan, son of Stephen the Great, Prince of 'Moldavia, the Sublime Porte bound itself to defend and maintain the territorial integrity of Moldavia, the privileges and immunities of the inhaboitants, and the intornal independence of tho Principality. The treaty of Kainardji, concluded between the Sublime Porte and Russia in 1774, and the treaty of Jazsy, signed in 1791 between the wne Powers, conferred on Russia the right of protecting the Principalities. Now, that right of protection, such as it reseults from the very stipulations of treaties and of several hatti-scheri1is, particularly that of 1802, issued at the special request of Russia, had been expressly recognized, in order the better to secure and guaran. tee the territorial integrity of M30davia, the north-eastern boundary of which, agreeably to those conventions, was to be formed by the Dniester. " How then could u1sia; the protectress of the Principalities, the voluntary guirdlain of their privileges and their territorial integrity, legifimately despoil-them of that same territory which she had so soiemnly guaranteed ? "How, after so many precautions against the Porte, with the object of confirming still more the principle of our integrity, could the protecting Power recognize the right to violate it by an exemption in its own favour and in its special interest ? "How could the state of war between' the Porte and Russia in 1812, be the just motive, to the prejudice of ourPrincipality, for the violation of rightsformallyadxmitted by the first of these Powers and guaranteed by the second? " Good faith, equitv, the security of Europe, whichis interested in giving us a frontier which can be easily defended; and which by a fixed and natural limit may remove all chances of dispute, the comnunity of origin, language, manners,-all, in fine, prove our indefeasibleo right to recover our ancient limits to the Dniester. "We supplicate the Sublime Porte to weigh well these considerations, and to support them energeticaly with the allies, and with Russia herself, which, thanks to the spirit of wisdom and moderation that now seems to direct the councils of her young and august Sovereign, may reconsider a measure arbitrarily adopted at a period of crisis and of violent wars. She cannot but admit that it behoves a great nation to repair an act of injustice; that it becomes the ancient protectress of a weak, but a Christian and orthodox people like herself, to restore to her entire theprovincethe security of which had been placed under her guardianship." The Levant packet Jourdain, which was expected at Marseiles on Tuesday, having broken her engine near Messina, transferred her passengers and despatchea at Naples on the 16th to the Languedoc, which reached Marseilles yesterday. The English steamer Empress and the Sardinian sailing trans. ports Giuseppe, Saker, and India, the two latter laden with war matd7iel, have also entered Marseilles, coming from the East. Seven Catholic clergymen and a number of Sisters of Charity had arrived at Marseilles on their way to Constantinople, where typhus fever rages with some intensity. One of these clergymen, formerly a missionary in India, has a woen leg, and is a Knight of the Legion of Honour. A detachment of 100 hospital orderlies was also waiting at Marseilles to embark for Constantinople. The following private telegraphic despatches have been received:- "I IARSEILTES, 'LEancn 18. "The Languedoc has arrived from Constantinople, with news to the 10th. " The Russians made prisoners by the French were to be taken to Odessa to be exchanged for Turkish prisoners. " General Larchey had received orders to return to France. The Presse d'Orient states that very severe cold existed at Anapa. The same journal declares the health of the troops to be satisfactory." " i1TVr, EVENEN-G. "Accounts from Alexandria, of the 11th, state that the disturbances in Upper Egypt have been put down. " The last accounts from Constantinople statetheweather tobe very tempestuous, and that the packet from,the Crimea had not arrived. Snow was three feet deep at Constantinople. " The journals of the Turkish capital express their approbation of the article in the SiMec, which was copied intothe Moniteur. The Journ-al de Co tantinople strongly insists on the demarcation of the Russian Transcaucasian frontier. " The Armenians and Greeks have protested against the late hatti-scheriff. The Greek petition, in particular, is directed against the clauses of the document relative to the clergy. " Ismail Pasha, who commands in Roumelia, takes the command of the T,1d;zh tbroops ,tb Bzereum. " The Austrian Government has decorated several Turkish civil functionaries. Among them are Affif and Noureddin, attadchs to the Ottoman Embassy in Paris." - "TRIESTE, MIes 19.

"Ten nobles of Iolstein have made the following proposition :-' The Council of the Kingdom shal request the King to cause an examination to be made into the constitution and the law of election for the States of the Duchies. In the event of amendments being proposed, they are to be submitted to the examination of the Council of the Kingdom."' "MADRID, MARcH 18. "The discussion on the bases of the bil on administrative organi7ation has been brought to a close in the Cortes. "The Government has declared that it will not make a Cabinet question of the plan of finance presented by M. Santa Cruz. "General tranquillity prevails." We read in the Maniteaur de la FloaoeM " A private letter from the Sea of Azoff, dated the 2d inst., informs us that the news of the conclusion of an armistice had just been announcedto the population along the coasts of that sea, where it had everywhere produced a deep sensation, and been regarded as the forerunner of peace. AtM-ioupol,Kaaandib,Berdiansk, Gheisk, and inthe whole Gulf of the Don, commercial transactions, which had been completelyparalyzed by the war, recovered as if by enchantment fresh activity, and a great number of articles, hitherto usaleable, had found purchasers at a good price. The announcement of the armistice was received at Taganrog, in particular, with the greatest enthusiasm. This beautiful city, which is becoming every day more important, is the emporium of the extensive trade carried on in the country watered by the Don. It suffered considerably by the war, and has not forgotten that it is indebted to the generosity of the commanders of the alied squadrons for having been preserved from complete destruction in. the month of June last. On the 1st March the Governor issued aproclamation to apprise the inhabitants of the conclusion of anarmistice,andduringtheentiredaythepopulationtrave1.e the streets and squares, crying 'Long live the Emperor !' At night all the, houses were iluminated. It is impossible to imagine the immense popularity the Emperor Alexander has acquired in consequence of his pacific dispositions. It appears that the great Imperial foundry, situate on tha left bank of the Don, had been closed, in virtue of an order from St. Petersburg. The Russian fleet in the Black Sea - drew thence the principal part of itssupplies. This oircumstance confirms the intention already manifested by the Court of Russia to abandon all her naval establishments in the Black Sea." The Monitear de la Plotte contains the following letter from Macao : "The ships of the naval station in Indo-China, commanded by Rear-Admiral Guerin, lately visited the kingdom of iAeou-Tchieou, which includes all the archipelago of that name, lying between Japan on the north and China on the west' This State is ruled by a king, who resides at Choui, and is placed under the suzerainty of China and Japan. The Governments of Pekin and Jeddo both maintain an ambassador at the Court of the Prince. The archi- pelago of Uieou-Tchieou is formed of 37 islands, the largest of which, containingthe capital, is70mlesginlength. Their soil is generally fertile, and they possess several good harbours. A French mission is established there and doing well. The recent conflagration at Macao has produced everywhere agreat sensation. The casualties are estimated at 9,000,000f. An English company has offered to rebuild the Chinese town, provided a privilege it has long demanded be granted to it., The high mandarnn of the province has forwarded their proposition to Pekin. The Portuguese Go. vernment has addressed to its Court a long report en that frightful catastrophe. It declares in that document that the Portuguese town was indebted for its preservation to the courage and exertions of ihe French seamen of tho fgate Virginia and the corvette Constantine, without w hose timely asmistance the entire city, would now be a heap of ruins. All the foreign onsauls have written in the same sense to their respective Goverrments. Eighty of the incendiaries, who set the town on fire for the sake of plunder, have been arrested. Most of them are notorious criminals. They are to be tried with all the rigour of the laws. Tho Virginia has since sailed for Manila, and the Constantine for the archipelago of Mfenan. XL de lMontigny, who has been charged with a special missiort to the Idngdom of Siam, embarked in the Constantine, which has been ordered horme." The Independane Beige publishes the' following letter from Hamburg of the 15th inst..- " The English Government, notwithstanding well grounded hopes of peace, continues to extend its redruiting operations for the Anglo-Gernan Legion all over the North of Europe. Its numerous agents, who are liberally paid, display in the exercise of their functions a zeal often exaggerated, which is checked by the severity of the las,s and an energetic repression. Nearly every day the Hamburg police, and that of Altona and of the neighbouring localities, succeed in arresting a r,umber of those overzealou!s agents in the act of enlisting recruits. They are usually condemned to imprisonment and fine, and, if strangers to the country, they are expelled, and conducted by the armed force to the frontior. Since the re-opening of the navigation along our coast, the English Government has sent thither the ship of war Prometheus, with the evident intention of protecting onlistments. This ship- cruiaes continually between Heligoland and Cxhaven, at the entrance of the North Sea. It is calculated that during the last month about a thousand men were landed in the isand of Heligoland by English steamers. The number of recruits was considered sufficient to form a fifth regiment of. infantry, and a few days ago the steamer Victoria, of 900 tons, anived from England at Heligoland to take on board 700 of these recruits and convey them to Shorm¢liffe. Another steamnex was shortly expected in the island to embark for the same destination the recruits who could not find roora in the Victoria." A private letter from Madrid, of the l4th inst., says:- "Some time since Senor Figaerola, President of the Committee on the Budget, and, in virtue of his office, sitting imediately behind the Treasury Bench, declared 'that the English holders of Spanish coupons had nothing whatever to expect, as they had been well paid, and their claims were untenable.' On that day the bench of AMinisters happened to be unusuaUy full, on account of the im' portanGe of the debate, which tumned on the expenses and resources of the year. The Ministers present took part constantly in the details of this debate, but allowed the declaration just mentioned of the President of the Comn mittee, Senor Figuerola, to pass without refutation, modification, or remark- The English Minister, Lord Howden, thought it his duty, in the interest of the spoliatedl bondholders, to report this circumstance to his Governxment, together with the approving silence of the whole Treasury Bench, which, as is ecutomary in the Cortes, is in constant communication with the President of the Commission onthe subject of the debate relating to that commission. "I am assured that Lord Howden was instructed by Lord Clarendon to ask for explanations from the Spanish Government, and to ascertain whether they agreed with the presumed exponent of their opinions, Senor Figuerola,-as to whether the English bon&holders were to expect nothing fromthe existingGovernmentof Spain. The Spanish Government have lawtly refused to give any explanation of their opinons or intentions, and of course by their silence signify their assent to what w as expressed by one of their own organs. ' The Credit Mobilier is considered to have injured the cause of the bondholders, from the circumstance that English capital is less wanted, for it is a melancholy fact that foreign, and especially English, claims are never listened to, except in proportion to the necessity for foreign or English aid." It appears that the political world in Madrid is much occupied by an attempt to form what is called a tercer partido, or third party. The J'ounurl des Ddbats alluded to it yesterday, elaborately and approvingly, in an article which is odorous of Malmaison. There are, to be sure, some incidental eulogies on Espartero and O'Donnell, which are about as sincere as the few good words in defence of Charles Surface by his candid brother Joseph. The people of MIadrid, ever apt to give just nicknames, call this new combination, "El pa7tido de los tres Manolos"-" the party of the three MIanolos," a description derived from the names of the three men who are at the head of it. These are-Manue6 de la Concha (Marquis of Douro), Manuel Cortina, and Manuel Cantero. Manolo is the more familiar form of Manuel for the masculine, as for the femiinine Manola, for 3Ianuela ; and it is applied to the dandies of the lower classes in Madrid, the swaggering beau of the pit of the bullring or of the wine-shops of the Lavapies; loquacious and false, witty and corrupted, bragging and tmimd. The party of the three Manolos is organized independently of the Parliament, and a manifesto to the nation, or to their constituents, is expected from them in a few days. Now, considering that the three political Manolos have seats in the Cortes, where, Heaven knows, no one can now complain of having his tongue tied up, and whore liberty of speech is too often carried to licentiousness, it is difficult to conceive the legitimate utility of an extra Parliamentary faction. Among other eminent qualities which the Marquis of Douro, "the Conqueror of Portugal," believes himself to possess is eloquence, and the tribunals and Parliament of Madrid were long familiar with the oratory of Manuel Cortina; yet it is astonishing that both have so long remained mute wshen they have a right to be heard, and would be heard, in their legitimate approval or opposition to the nets of the Government. The tiers .parti is nothing more nor less than the nucleus of a combination to upset the Government, and particularly that member of it whose popularity and whose honesty, despite some weaknesses of character, have, up to the present, saved the monarchy in Spain. If, by any chance, General O'Donnell imagines for a moment that this tiers par-ti 'will end to his advantage, personally or politically, he is woefully mistaken. The struggle would be between Concha and Narvaez, and, in either case, the reaction would surpass anything that has yet been witnessed. It is said that the Government are in such a position as to catch at any straw, and that the Esparterists are delighted at the prospect of any support, however temporary or however doubtful, that may save them from the fierce hostilitv of the Democratic party, which attacks Esparero and O'Donnell daily in its organ, the Soberana 2Nacioual. They will soon learn that this third party is nothing but a deeplaid scheme of the Moderados and Reactionists to get the balance of the Chamber into their own hands, with the direction of affairs, and the consequent expulsion of the national liberal party. The very fact that this attempt is made under the auspices of the Marquis of Douro would have opened any eyes less hermetically sealed than, I fear, are those of the Duke de la Victoria. The Marquis of Douro is a man whose retrograde opinions in religion, politics, and commerce, are only equalled by the intensity of his egotism, his inordinate appreciationof himself, and his confined notions,-I may say, ignorAtnce,-on all subjects of European interest. In matters of trade he is a professed protectionist. Before the revolution of July, 1854, no one was so anxious to overthrow the throne and change the succession, expecting to be the first actor in the drama. Now that he has encountered more clever'or more fortunate rivals on the stage, and that his own very inferior qualifications assin to him the lowest part, he lends his house and his name to every intrigue to destroy what exists. The Iberia, one of the -best written Liberal papers in Madrid, has, I perceive, sounded the alarm about this "terserpartido" now in process of concoction; but, as there are some of the' old, worn-out, and dull Progresistas in it-a sort of doctrinaires known in Spain by the term SmAos-men who, like many others elsewhere, have learned nothing, with the additional misfortune of having forgotten everything, I doubt much whether Espartero and O'Donnell will see the snare which is set for them.

The Oae ieh>icli Zeitutng contains aletter of the 13th from its Kalisach correspondent, which gives sorae insight iinto the opinions of the RuWiau4 in regard to the Hatti-Scheriff recently published bfthe Porte. The promised improvement in the position of the Christians has considerably dirinished the ardour of the war party, " which feels that at the price of the emancipation of the Christians Russia can afford to make some few concessions," The Kalisch writerconsoleshimself for the defeat of Russia by the reflection that the Grmek Christians in Turkey * will always attribute their emancipation to the Czar rather than to his adversaries, and the probabillty is that he forms a perfectly just estimate of the political sagacity of the non-Christian subjects- of his Sublime Highness. The armaments still continue in Russia, although many of the officers belonging to the army in the Crimea have received leave of absence until tho end of this month. Prince Gortschakoff, the Stadtholder of Russian Poland, has left I Warsaw, and gone to inspect the fortress of IIvanorod.' It is- known to the Russians in Vienna that this Cabinet is disinclined to any great change in the political organization of the Danubian Principalities, and they prophesy that the Russian Goverment will do all in its power to secure liberal institutions for them, "as they will harcly fail to prove a source of annoyance to Austria." Prince Stirbey left Vienna for Paris on the 14th, and it is stated that he has been sent there on aspecial snissionby his father, the Hospodar of Wallaehia. Yesterday six Wallachian officers arrived at Vienna, where they are to remain until they have learned the system of exercising and |manceuvring practised by the Austrian army. Prince Gortschakoff left for St. Petersburg yesterday evening, and it is generally believed that he will not again return to this city as the representative of Russia. The day before yesterday you learned from me that His Holiness the Pope had convoked the Austrian Synod for the 6th of April, the clay fixed on by is Majesty the Emnperor, and the Wiener Zeitutng confirms the news by the publication of the followingletterof invitation, which was addressed by his Emninence the Cardinal N{uncio at Vienna to the Bishop of irnz- "Very Rev. Sir,-As the concordat, which Mas concluded on the 18th of August, 1855,. between the Papal Chair and His Imperial Royal Apostolic Majesty, is of ex. traordinary inportance for the church of Christ, His lail. ness considered it advisable and salutary that the Bishops of the Austrian empire should meet and talke into consideration the several articles of the convention in question, in order that the conditions therein contained might be more conscientionsly carried out, and Church and State be more closely united for the welfare of mankind. "As both Eis Holiness and His Imper.al Royal Apos. tolic Majesty consider the city of Vienna as the most fitting place for the Synod to meet, I now, in the name of our most-holy Father, invite you, very rev. Sir, to attend the assembly of Bishops, which is to meet on the 6th of the comning month, and at which I, in the name and by the authority of His Holiness, shall preside. "X. Cardinal 1VIAL,E." As soon as the intention of the Pope became known here a Cabinet Council, at which His Majesty presided, was held, and soon after the Ministers had separated a special messenger was sent with despatches to Rome. The object of His Holiness evidently is to show to the Emperor of Austria that he has no longer a right to convoke "N ational Syiiods," and it is believed that the claim of Rome to do sD is ba'sed on the following- f"t aticle of the concordat th "'l'he holy Roman Catholic religion shall ever be main tamned in the empire of Austria, and in aU its dependencies, i& al tlhose r iglds and rprivileges which, by the will of God and the conditions of the canons, it has to enjoy." Major Biddulph, wvho has been here on business connected withthe telegraph betweenConstantinople and London, has left for Berlin. While here the Major hadan interview with the Minister of Commerce, and explained to him how it was that the communication between Bucharest and Hermannstadt was so often interrupted. OntheWallachoAustrian frontier is a great deal of land which, is uninhabited, and whenever any injury happens to the wire there a long time generally elapses before it is discovered and repaired. Another matter to which the attention of the Mfinister has been directed is, that copper wire is used in Austria; copper is a better conductor than iron, but wire made of the last mentioned metal is the more durable. It is tlle wish of the British Gove ent to establish an " instantaneous" correspondence between Constantinople and London, and this may be done by means of ' translatoren," (transferers), which were, some two or three years since, invented by AL Steinheil, the present Director of Telegraphs in Bavaria. It is not yet settled whether the new wire is to pass through Northern Germany and by the Hague, or through SouthWestern Germany and France. Experience has taught me that the one line is no better thau the other; the former is very slow, and the latter cannot be relied on. It may be mentioned, that the electric cable between the Crmnea and Varna, which was broken in November last, is n6tlikelytobe repaired. The French dottheir work very well between Varna and Bucharest. The death of poor M. von 11inkleldey still forms the principal topic of conversation, and it gives me great satisfaction to be able to say that the Austrian nobles loudly condemn the conduct of the Junker clique. An Austrian Prince, who is considered the proud- est noble in the land, a day or two since declared that a the behaviour of the President of the Upper Chamber Was revolting (e np dre i d), and no one present -was incined to differ from him in opinion. The CreditFoncier (Immobilien-Gesellschaft) has not yet been reconstituted, but it soon will be so. It is to begin its operations by purchasing a part of the domains ceded to the Bank. The Emperor and Empress, with the vwhole of the Imperial family, went on Friday to the Exhibition of Pictures to see the portraits of the Empress Eugenie by Winterhalter. On the 12th the Emperor gave a private audience to Mr. F. Lang, an architect from London, w-ho exhibited plans for a fruit-hall, docks, and port on the Danube. It is rulnoured that Baron Kraus, the present Minister of Justice, is to be President of the Supreme Court of Justice. M: von Salvotti, a Councillor of the Empire, is likely to be Minister of Justice. Lord Palmerston's reply to the question put by Mr. Disraeli on the 14th has caused a very great improvement in every description of stock. The inhabitants of Kronstadt and Herinannstadt have petitioned the Minister of Commerce to let them have a railroad from Aradto Kronstadt, and their request is likely to be granted. PRUSSTA. (oMr ona owUR coNnRsProsXrr.) BERLIN, MARcr 1S. The shalow pool of Berlin life, usually so stagnant, is being just now disturbed to a most disquieting extent;. the "troubled waters are throwing up mire and dirt" that will not subside without leaving somne very nasty marks behind them, to serve some fature chronicler as imuiickr of the turbidness of the water, which police and press regulations keep so Still' and quiet to the eyes of the uninitiated beholder. Among the inrre- dients of excitement for the bulk of the upper and middle classes here, in the presence of the late duels and suic&les, as yet not half cleared up and accounted for, I have already quoted to you the episode of the theft of private papers and despatches from the lettercases of two men who stand in very close connexion wvith the King, which took place last summer. Very indistinct indications of the real nature of that transaction . have as yet trickled through the thick stratmuni of oficial secrecy to the knowledge of the -curious; but it would seem as if the departure of the Minister President (BaronManteulel) for Parishadatlength offered certain parties mied up in the matter a welcome opportmity. of divulging a variety of matters, the nature of which is to implicateL the highest Minister of State mn this not very creditable trnaction. -As Ifar .as my letters of about October last have reported the matter to you, there were two mnen-servants (those of the King's private Secretary, Niebuhr, ard of General Gerlach) arrested in Potsdam on suspicion of having betrayed the correspondence of their masters to. various persons interested in their contents; discretion compelled me to confine myself at that time to the indicition that this apprehension of the two culprits and their gobetween was the result of a complaint from the Court of St. Petersburg, for I was given to understand that these surreptitiously obtained despatches had found their way to the French Embassy here, and that there were ample proofs to be found in your columns that they had not been without efFect on the military operations of the allies in the Crimea. Be that as it may, it turned out subsequently that this was but a xmall par-t of the correspondence purloined;j ig~ tIO course of time other persons, Btanding very high, were pointed out as having profited by the oft-repeated? thefts; but as no judicial proceedings erer takien, or at least camne to the knowledge of the. public, the suspicions were never verified. The circumstance that leads now to a partial revelation of the intricate web of espionage, in spite of all the attempts made at Court to quash all iquiry is interesting, as indicative of the tortuous and reprehensible courses towhichthebaneful nature of the relation of the Kling to his M}Iinisters, and the existence of the Camarilla, give rise at the Prussian Court. In October of last year a man of the name of Techen -was taken into custody at Potsdam on suspicion of aiding and abetting the men-servants of the two abovenamed gentlemen in robbing their masters of papers annd of disposing of the spoil. This Techen, now an old man, had in former days been a police spy, and, as such, subordinate to a gentleman now occupying a high office under the Ministry of Finance at Potsdam, but formerly himself a confidential official of the seret police. From this latter the former was in the habit of begging and receiving pecuniary assistance, having been for a long time out of employ and in want. About two wears back, however, he comraunicated to his almsgiver that he was employed by the Minister President to report to hnimweeldy what went on at Potsdam for a monthly remuneration of 25 thalers. The trutih of this statement was subsequently substantiated by the most competent authority. Towards the close of 1854, moreover, he began to exhibit to his benefactor papers in his possession -which could only have been obtained in some very improper way. The gentleman in question, knowing in whose pay the man was, contented himself with mentioning the fact to the highest official, authorities, and left it to them to take the course they thought fit. Apparently the nature of the papers purloined or copied was too interesting to admit of these latter doing otherwise than wink at his nefarious practices, and "no questions were asked." Among the papers purloined was a copy of the report sent in to General Gerlach by a mauvtais szijet he had employed to spy out and report all the Prince of Prussia's sayings and doings while on a tour of militagy inspection, full of the most odious incriminations i of his Royal IHighness. This report was by this means brought to the knowledge of the Prince, and by him laid before the King. There were also the most private coTnmmnications from Count Munster at the Court of St. Petersburgr to General Gerlach, whether for communication to the King or not is tnot known. There may and must have been many others of an interesting nature, but of those that have been mentioned with all their details in the course of the secret investigation these are the only documents that offer any general interest. In the middle of last year Techen kept aloof for 'some time from his formner confidant, and on being casually met in the street decared he had been absent from home to go and take possession of some property left him at Hamburg; he neglected, however, to comply with the invitation to communicate some of the particulars of the legacy. He sufbsequently deposited with his former patron a quantity of papers andmoney, on thepleathathe was exposed to domiciliary visits from the police; subsequently he sent him a letter in great haste asking for the money and requiring an answer; this answer, from the man who has all along befriended him, is the only paper the police find in his house on making a search! The circumstances offer very strong presumptive evidence that on the approach of detection the man Techen selected his benefactor in Potsdam as the necessary stalking-horse, probably at the suggestion of some person of high standiug implicated in the affair; it is endeavoured by inuendoes to fix this latter imputation upon Baron von Manteuffel or the late President of Police; the evidence for this assumption is by no means so copclusive as for the former, but, in whatever way the 'matter be looked upon, it throws a very unpleasant light upon the back-door courses and the -underhand influences in play at this Court. What is above stated is the substance of the defence put forward on oath by the gentleman in Potsdamn high. in the service of the State, well of and respected, of -whom it can in no way be show;n that he was an interested party, -but that he communicated all he knew of the matter as fast as he became aware of -the nefarious practices of the spy, until he assured himself that the man was standing under high protection. This statement must inevitably be admitted as true, but it is doubtless not the whole truth, as far as the nature and number of the papers stolen are concerned; they have doubtless been disposed of, not all to any one employer, but separately to various parties, accordingto the nature of the interest of their contents. And what is it that has made these surreptitiously-obtained papers of so great value as to make men of high standing close their eyes to the probable method by which they were obtained? It is the existence of a Camarilla at Court, the interposition of a number of men between the King and his ostensible Ministers,to whom the latter are virtually subjugatedtothe extent of the influence which any one or more of them may gain over the RoyalDmind. There are seven M1inisters of State, and for every department thus ostensibly and openly recoognized there is a Secretary, or Cabineksrath, or Adjutant, immediateiy attached to the person of the King as a sort of private collateral counsellor; almost all the documents the Minister submits to the King have to pass through the hands of this occullt Privy Councillor, who furnishes the King 'With his knowledge, his views, and his advice on the subject. This is precisely the institution that the great reformer of Prussia, Baron Stein, abolished in 1806, as the first grand obstacle in the way of good government; and so long as it is retained in its pyesent revived form the King will always be exposed to the supposition of being more or less under the influence of these intermediate channels of business, and his Ministers will be in the same degree wanting in zeal and independence, as not feeling themselves standing, in a direct personal relation to their Sovereign. The existence of the Cabinetsrath, &c., is recognized and understood, and is productive of evil " only in a lower degree," but the existence of the Camarilla, in the shape of Adjutants and Chamberlains, &c., is the one great fatal curse of the country, depriving the King of the respect- and admiration due to himself both in the eyes of his subjects and of foreigners abroad, and giving rise instead to feelings of suspicion, mistrust, slight, and contempt, which could have no place if he stripped himself of this baneful entour age. Itwill be the King's own fault if, on some subsequent occasion, the Western Powers should declare to him they can have no confidence in his professions as long as General von Gerlach occupies his present position; Napoleon I. in his insolence of power demanded of the pitiable Friedrich Wilhelm IIL that he should banish from his dominions un 'nongm Stein, the refounder of his kingdom. It will be a great blessing for Prussia and her King -whenever any party, whether at home or abroad, is in a position to demand the banishment, at least from Court. of un- nomrnme GctladL. Ask where vou will of the best informed persons, no one can point out a single creditable action or a wholesome piece of advice emanating from that quarter. THE BALTIC. (FROM OUR OWN cOPnRSrOyuDl.) HAMBURG, Mxcu 1iS. The British steam sloop Sampson, 6 guns, Captain Brock, arrived yesterday from the flying sqaadrou, with despatchesfromCommodore Watson, C.B. The vessels, in their cruise up the Baltic, had found much floating ice along the coasts, and the cold was very severe. With respect to any Russian ships of war having been seen at any time moving about the Gulf of Finland or the Baltic Sea, such a thing was impossible, even had they wished to do so, on account of the great masses of ice seen on all parts of the coast. The navigation of the Elbe, for some miles down the river, has experienced a complete' stoppage for want of a sufficiency of water to convey vessels up and down, in consequence of the easterly winds which have prevailed for some dayspast. Even the city canals cannot be traversed by lighters to convey goods to and from the vessels in port, and business is therefore at a thorough standstill. The wreck of the Hambaurg ship Adolph, Captain ienningsen, which took place some days ago in the British Channel, on her voyage to Africa, has created some sensation. She had a valuable cargo in her. __ _ _ _ _ _ _ The Chancellor of the Exchequer acknowledges the receipt of the first-half of a 101,.-note (No.. 57,012) for unpaidl Income-tax froma "90. J. 0" aad

Un=1:I I SPAI1w.-The Barcelona papers contain accounts of two strange crimes just committed in that city. A torecdor named SeviUa got into a quarrel with a butcher of the Plaza de San MIigiel, and struck him in the face, after which he took to flight. The next morning he walked slowly before the butcher's shop, and the butcher's wife, seeing him, cried out, "If ever you dare to present yourself before me again I will make you repent your inualt to my husband." After a while the toreador returned, and said tauntingly, "You see, my fine lady, that I am not afraid of you." The woman, making no reply, seized one of the huge knives which Spanish butchers use and which are nearly as sharp as a razor, and 'ith one blow skilfuly applied cat his left arm completely off. She was immediately arrested, and, as she was beingr conveyed to prison, exclaimed repeatedly, "I care not what is done to me as long as my husband is aveged !"

SPRI2NG ASSIZES. NORTHERN CIRCUIIT. YORK. MAtRCH 19. CROWN COURT.-(Rcfore Mfr. Justice WrLL-.) olin-Scott was indicted under the 2a2d section of the u-nkrupt law Consolidation Act, 1849, for having. in contemplation of and after bankruptcy, mutilated his books of account, by tearing four leaves out of his ledger, and also for making a false entry and an alteration in his accounts, with intent to defraud his creditors. The indictment contained 16 counts, varying these charges. Mr.. O verend, Q. C. , and Mfr. Shaw' prosecuted, and Mr. Camp'oell Foster and Mr. Riley defended the prisoner. It ap~peared that on the 19th of November last the defendant, S-cott, bein in difficulties, consulted a person named Chambers, at Leeds, a sheriff's officer and accountant, who advised him to make a declaration of insolvency and petiton the Court of Bankruptcy to be declared a bankrupt. The 'defendant accordingly did so, representing himself to be a blanket manufacturer, dealer, and chapman, at Earlsheaton, near Leeds. Accordingly, the necessary preliminary stepe having been taken, the defendant was declared a bankrupt by M%r. West, he Bankruptcy C,omnisioner, on Friday, the 2Sd of November last. Accordingtothe evidence of two bailff's followers, named araclough and Firth, in the emuloysnent of the sherif's offcer Chambers, the defenldant brought his books and accounts to M:r. Chamber's ofice on the WGednesday before he was decLared bankrupt, for the purpcse of having a balancesheet made out, and, according to the evideoce of Barraclough he then tore out two leaves from his ledger, containing an account of a Mr. Clarkson, of Leeds, who owed him a sum of money, and subsequently on the Tuesday after the bankruptcy he tore out foulr leaves, containing another ccount, of Messs. ilwa and Poole, at the Wheatsheaf En, in Leeds, i the presnce of beth Firth and Barra- lough. It was also stated by these men that he altered the statement of the amount of a debt due to his brother, Janzes -Scott, in the list of his liabilities delivered to Chambers, from 901. S. to 1901. 3s., stating that there had been 1001. bill lent to him by his brother but that he refused to fill up a blank stamp with a promissory note for the amount to give to his brother as security, and thatihe had altered his ledger to correspond with his account. The bankrupt was afterwards examined at great length before the Commissioner of Bankrupts, Mr. Ayrton, and gave a confused statement, contradictory in many respects of his transactions with his books imnmediately before and after his bankruptcy, and, as to the leaves taken out of the ledger, denied having taken any out, and stated that his brother had told him he saw Chambers himself tear oiut the leaves and burn them when the bankrupt was not present. These examinations were tendered m evuidence, and objected to by the learned counsel for the defence as inadmissible. EHis Lordship took a note of the objection, and said he would consider whether he would reserve the point, and admitted the examinations. In c.ross-examination of Barraclough and Firth various contradictions as to the facts proved by them were elicited, and i5rth admitted that he had on four occasions allowed his name to be used in fictitious suits instituted by debtors against themselves for the purpose of being taken in execution and then taking the benefit;of the Insolvent Acts; and that on one occasion he had accepted two guineas to come to York and swear to a fictitious debt, though he had not been called upon to do so. It also appeared that 3ir. Chambers had urged the defendant to get money for him from various debtors of his after he had become bankrupt. For the defence it was contended that neitherBarraclough nor Firth was deserving of the slightest credit; that they contradicted each other as to the facts proved by them; and thattheir stattements, if true, showed them to be partiesin the fraud attempted, and they were wholly uncorroborated. As to the leaves containing Clarkson's account torn out, it was urged that the defendant's brother's account, that Chaambers had himself torn out the leaves, was very likely to be true, in order to obtain the money due from Clarkson, and to cheat the creditors; and that his conduct warranted such a supposition; and, with regard to the other leaves, containin- Lilwall and Boole's account, said to be torn out, they were yet in the ledger, as appeared by the book ; and thebook itself, as to this fact, contradicted both Barra- lough and Firthi. The contradictions and confused account given by the defendant in his e:amiation before the Bankruptcy Commissioner was attributed to the&defendant having become confused under an examination lasting many hours. As to the alteration of the accounts and statement about the 1001. bill, it was averred to be a correct btatement, and the prosecution were challenged to call the persons said to have given the bill to the defendant's brother to contradict the defendant's statement about it. HisLoPsinsw then pioceeded to sn'- up the evidence, extracting the various statements as to eaci; fact, and telling the jury that, if they could believe the evidence of Barraclough and Firth, one of whom had admitted himself to be as vile and as base as man could be, and the other had never discovered for several weeks what he said he knew to be wrong and believed to be a fraud, coupled with the statements made by the defendant in his examination as to the transactions, they mnust find the prisoner guilty. If they thought on the whole matter that the defendant was not made out to have committed any of the offences imputed to bim, they must acquit him. The jury retired, and, after half an hour's absence, retrned with a verdict of Guilty. * His LoanDsu' said he would take time to consider whether he wo-did reserve the objections taken, and defer lassing sentence. * The case occupied the day. CrvL CouRT.-(Before Mr. Baron MAP.Ms and a Special lTury.) AYfl`ERSON- V. FtRUBN- ASND HUCTON. This was an action brought to recover the value of two promissory notes from the defendant, and his father-in-law as surety. The defendants pleaded a set-off. 3kr. Knowles, Q.e., Mr. Serieant Wilkins. -and Mr. :Manisty appeared f.:r the plaintiff; and Mr. Watson and Mr. Price for the defendants. The form of the pleadings entitled the defendants' counsel to oegin. It appeared that the defendant Fairbiun had been assisted in his business, as a printer and publisher of a monthly publication at York in 1849, by the plaintiff, who is an attorney at York-, advancing him 2001. on a promissory note, one ofthose in question, onwhich his father-inlaw. the other defendant, became jointly liable. In the beginning of 1S0 the plaintiff had an interview with the defendant Fairburn, and complained that he was ill-treated by the local papers, two of which he asserted to be under the infuence of a personal enemy and rival, Mr. Leman, another attorney of considerable reputation in York, and that he then agreed with the defendant to turn the monthly publication into a weekly newspaper to be called the Farmer' Friend and Preemmn's .Jouwat, for which he agreed to advance the funds, the nevwspaper fo be under his sole control, but the defendant Fairburn being held forth to the public as the ostensible propTietor, editor, and printer. The newspaper was accordingly pablished. and continued to exist til November, 1855. The defendant proved that the plaintiffhadfurnished all the leading articles, many of which, he stated, contained disparaging allusions to Mir. Leman, and other political opponents, and some of which were highly laudatory of himself. The newspaper had been conducted with a view to the advancement of the private and professional miterests of the plaintiff, and not with any regard to its success as a speculation, or for the benefit of the defendant as ostensible proprietor, and paragraphs and reports of petty sessions, and other cases in which the Plaintiffvwas concerned, -were prominently published, and the newspapers containing them distributed by the plaintiff's order to all the publicans of the district, and he had advanced towards the expenses incurred by the defendant 1,9801. The plaintiff received payment for professional advertisements, relatingto the business of his clients, from his clients, but had never paid the defendant for them, nor for his own servicesas a printer, for which he now claimed to set off a sum - coverinz the plaintif's demand. The newspaper circulated about 400 a-week, and the defendant was obliged to cease publishing it on getting no more money advanced by the plaintiff. On the cross-examination of the defendant it appeared that he hid made affidavits to the Stamp-office, declaring himself to be sole proprietor of the paper. 3Ir. Baron MARTIN thereupon interfered, and referred the defendants' counsel to a case of " Stephens v. Robinson," 2 Cr. ?nd J. reports, deciding that under such circulmstances a plaintiff could not recover against a person whom he represented to have been a co-proprietor, and suggested that the defendants' counsel should tender a bill of excentions, aad have the matter decided in a Court of Error. This course wvas assented to, and a verdict was thereupon found for the plaintiff for the amount claimed. The case seemed to excite much local interest.
'FRlIP1,k (ImrnorwP XTE&RA, MAEcH19 JBelore Ir. Scrjeant CIkEI,) Samuel Thomas Sloggatt was indicted for forging a letter with intent to defraud. Mr. Coleridge and Mr. Bere were counsel for the prosecoution; and Mr. Collier and Mlr. Lopes defended the prisoner. The prisoner was adraper at Plymouth, and dealt -with a large wnolesale house in London-Mfessrs. Grocock and Co. In 1855 he became a bankrmpt, and the qrosecutors were his ass:gnees. The business between the prisoner and Messrs. Grocock was carried on through a Mr. Hughes, as the agent - of Grocock. In 1854 there became a question whether credit ought to be further extended to the prisoner, and it -as represented to him that Messrs. Grocock could not give him any more credit, unless he could give some references. The prisoner, uponthis, referred Mr. Hughesto his father, - who was a very respectable man. Grocock addressed a letter to the father. This letter came into the hands of the sister, wvho, perceivin upon it the name of Grocock, and Xknowing the prisouerYhad dealings vwith that house. she gave hm the letter. The pnsoner afterwvards wished his father to aner for his circumstances, which, however, the father objected to do. The prisoner then answered Grocock's letter in a most favourable manner. The letter was, in truth, written by a brother of the prisoner; but upon the dictation of the prisoner. In consequence of that letter other goods were furnished to the prisoner. It was stated for the prosecution that the object was not punishment, but to let the public know that such an act was a fraud, and vws not to be pennitted. In the cross-examination of the witnesses it appeared that the purport of the letter was that the prisoner's capital was about 3007., and that the prisoner was about to be inarrieito a Mrs. Warburton, who had upwvards of 30., which money he was at the time usig in hiis trade. The letter in question wis written by. the prisoner's brother Richard, and the prisoner took it to his father and showed it to hiu, when thef ther said, " Samuel, don't send that letter," as he did not believe the fact stated in it to be literally true, The prisoner's brother Richard wrote all his father's letters for hinn and put his nanie to them. - Mr. COLLIER, in tho course of the cae, objected to the examination of the prisoner before the Commnissioner of Bankruptcy being read, on the ground that such exasnina. tion was compulsory, and not voluntary, inasmuch as if he refused to answer any question he might be co-n,nitted to prison. Mr. COLmCGE contended that such examination might be read. Itimight as weil be said that in x great case to whlich the public zmind had been directed, if the prisoner (Mh(r. Palmner) should be acquitted of the mnore serious cases, nd should boe indicted for forgery', his evidence given in a cause in t4e 3l C'eu2, in whica he dmlitted nimmelf to have been an accessory before the fact, could not be used against him. Mr. Serjeant C_sn\m said he was prepared to give his opinion, but in a case of so much importance he shoulprefer cosulting Mr. Justice Crowder. The learned JuDGE, having returned, said that be was of opinion the statement of the bankrupt was receivable. It had been suggested that, inasmuch as the bankrupt was bound to disclose all particulars relative to 'his estate, this was a declaration equal to ah examination upon oath, and was compulsory, and not voluntary. He agreed with Mfr. Collier in thinkin that its being a mere declaration nade no difference, and he treated the case as if the bankrupt had been sworn. The difficulty was this --The bankrupt was supposed to be under compulsion. It Was a general rule of law that no man was bound to criminate himselL He did not think the Bankrupt Act compelled a bankrupt to answer questions tendingto criminate himself, nor tbht a commissioner would commit a bankrupt for refusing to answer such a question; therefore the examination was voluntary. Mir. COLmu:, in' addre'sing the jury for the prisoner, urged upon them that in the first place the letter did not contain anything that was untrue; then that the letter was written by the brother of the prisoner, who always wrote letters for the father; and he animadverted strongly on the fact that the prosecution was not instituted by the father or by Messrs. ¢rocock, who were the parties alleged to have been injured, but by the assignees, 'who, it would seem, had Iacted chiefly upon the suggestion of the Bankrapt Commis- sioner. Mfr. Serjeant CHANNELL having summed up. r The jary foundtheprisoner Guitty of uttering, and he was sentenced tG two months' imnprisonment.
nAyVTrn nilrprrrr STAFFORD. MARCH 19. CIVL COURT.-(Before Mr. Justice CRESSWEL Land a Special Jury.) ROBERTS AND OTHERS V. AIEn. Mr. Alexander, Q.C., Mr., Whitmore, QC., and Mfr. Phipson appeared-for the plaintiffs; and Mr. Wi{ateley, QC., 3r. reaatig, Q.O., Mr. Selfe, Mr. Gray, and Mr. Somerset for the defendant. - r At the sitting of the Court this morning the trial of this cause was renewed. Several more witnesses were examined on the part of the defendant to show that the damage which had been done to the plaintiffs' houses was to be attributed, not to the working of the defendant's mines underneath them, but to the existence of a bed of rumning sand lying some yards beneath their foundations. Some of the witnesses stated that in the town of Westbromwich houses where there were no workings underneath were in many cases cracked, while, on the other hand, houses standing above workings were perfectly sound. Another theoiy advanced by some of the defendant's witnesses was that the damage arose fromthe draining out of the water from the sandbed, as well as from the deficient fall of rain during the last four years, which had not provided a sufficient supply of water to support the sand in its position. Mr. Justice CRSSivELr, in summing up the evidence, said the question for the jury was whether the injury to the plaintiV houses arose from the coal workings of the defendant. If they were of that opinion, their verdict ought to be for thie plaintiffs. His Lordship said that, if the jury wished him, he would read over the evidence; but if they thought they fully understood it, that would be unnecessary. The jury said it would be quite -unnecessary, and, in a few minutes, found a verdict for the plaintiffs, with 2,5001. damages. Mr. Justice CRESSWELL observed that this cause was one of those ins'ances where the exercise of too much inge. nuity involved parties in considerable expense. STORES V. COX AND OTHERS. 3Mr. Keating, Q.C., and Mr. Hodgson appeared for the plaintiff; and 3Mr. Whateley, Q.C., and Mr. Phipson for the defendants. The plaintiff in this action was a tanner and currier, carrying on business at WValsall, under the style of Stephen Stokes and Co., and he sued the defendants, who were three directors of the Birmingham Fire-office, to recover the sumn of 4,0001. -rpon a policy of insurance against fire effected with the defendants in November, 185. The defendants pleaded the general issue, and also three otlher pleas, in which they alleged that the risk had been increased by the erection on the premises of a steam-engine, and also a hazardous process of grinding and drying bark, without the consent of the defendants, and withot notice, or payment of increased premium, whereby the policy became void. It appeared that, by the 7th condition of the policy, it was provided that, if after the assurance shall have been effected the risk should be increased by any alteration of the materials composing the building, or by the erection of any stove, coakel, kin, furnace, or the like, the introduction of any hazardous process, the deposit of any hazardous goods, the making of any hazardous communication, or by any other alteration of circumstances, and the particulars of the same shall not be endorsed on the policy by the secretary, or some other authorized agent of the company, and a proportionate higher prenium paid (if required), such instrument shallbe of no force. At the time the policy was effected there was upon the plaintiffs' premises a furnace with a boiler, the steam from which was employed only in heating and drying the building and their contents, but since that time the plaintiff had passed a two-inch pipe through a 14-inch brick wall, and this placed the boilU in connexion with an engine which he had erected in an adjoining building. This engine was employed in the breaking and grinding of bark. The witnesses called on the part of theplaintiffstated that, in their opinion, a steam-engine, independently of the furnace and boiler, was not " a stove, coakel, kdln, furnace, or the like," and that, as the furnace and boiler were on the premises before the policy, they did not consider that the risk wvas at all increased by the connezion of the newly-erected engine with the old boiler, by means of the pipe passing through the 14-inch wall. They also stated that there was no risk in the barkmill, working, asit did, atthe rate of 15 revolutions a-mninute. It was admitted that the fire by which the plaintiff's premises and stock, valued at more than 4,0001., were entirely destroyed, was not in any degree owing to the alterationwhich the plaintiff had made. r. WHATELEY, on the part of the defendants, submitted that, as the plaintiff had altered his premises since they were insured, the policy bad become void, and cited "Sellen v. Thornton," E. and B, 868. He also conteuded that since the addition of the new engine the case came within the class of " special risks," the building being now " a manufactory having mill, steam, or engine work," the old furnace and boiler, with its addition, constituting a " steam-engine." Mr. Justice CsEsSwxLL said he should not prejudice the case by expressing any opinion, but would direct the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff, and give the defendant leave to move to enter a nonsuit, if the Court should be of opinion that the action could not be sustained. A verdict was taken accordingly for the plaintiff, for CrxAL CoSUrT.-(Before Mr. Baron BRArwEtLT.)

TTartfp fTrqTrTM KENGSTON, XARcu 20. IffeJore Air. JsXtce ;OLERIIDGE.) THE QUEMr V. XOIDaVR1Tr. This was an indictment for peijury, which was speciaUy fxed to be taken this morning. Mr. E. JAmns, Q.C. (who was retained, with Mfr. Parry, for the defendant), Mt the sitting of the Court, applied to have the trial postponed to the summer avnues. Mr. Ballantine, whowas instructed onbehalf of the prosecution, did not oppose the application, and the trial was consequently ordered to stand over to the next assizes. A?LDPEWS AND ANOTHER V. PL1J3LMER. This was an action to recover 501. upon an I 0 U signed by the defendant. Mr. Serjeant Shee, Mr. Ribton, and Mr. Pearce were counsel for the plaintiffs; Mr. Ballantine and Mr. Hawkins appeared for the defendant. This cause was tried at the spring assizes before Mr. E. James, Q.C,, who officiated in consequence of the illness of Mr. Justice Maule, and upon that occasion a verdict was given for the defendant. The plaintiffs were the executors of a Mr. James Andrews, who was the brother of one of them, who, it appeared, in his lifetime kept the Tanners' Arms publichouse, Bersnondsey. The defendant Plummer had married the widow of a son of James Andrews, and he and his wife lived with him, and it appeared that the latter managed the business of the publihouse. It would seem that the deceased had been in the habit of assisting Plummer by lending him money, and the case on the part of the plaintiffs was that a few days before his death he had lent the defendant 501., and he gave an I 0 U for the amount. Application was subsequently made to him by the executors for repayment, when it appeared that he repudiated the claim, and upon the trial he swore positively that no such sum of maonev was advanced to him, and that, in point of fact, the I ( U was a forgery, and the jury, upon this occasion, returned a verdict in his favour. Application v.as subsequently made for a new trial, which, upon the facts laid before the Court, was granted, without costs, and it appeared that a char"e of perjury wvas also preferred against the defendant, ~an the trial and the indictment were both sent down to these assizes to he dtisposed of. Mr. Serjeant Snun opened the case in a brief and concise manner, and the plaintffs and several other witnesses were then examnined. Their evidence was of the same character as that which was given on the foraer triaL Mr. Andrews, one of the plaintiffs, swore distinctly that he was present when the deceased lent the defendent 501., and that lie was to give an I O Uas security. It appeared, however, that instead of a "U," the letter "DI' was placedon the document, and he said that, upon his attention being directed to the fact, he spoke to the defendant upon the subject, and he asked him to draw it up in proper form, and he did so, and the defendant thensigned the YO U, uponwhich the action was brought, in his presence. Mr. Chapman gave similar evidence, andtheirtestimonywas confirmed to'aconsiderable extent by several other witnesses, and it was also stated that when the defendant was first applied to upon the suxbject of the 10 U., and he-was asked to pay the amount, he made no objection with reference to the genuineness of the document, but merely required that a legacy to which his vwife was entitled and a certain sum of money for her services in the bushiess should be allowed as a set-oflM Mr. BALLuNmE having addressed the jiry, the defendant was called, and he swore as positively that no such transaction as the one aLluded to ever occurred, and that he consequently had never signedathe iustrament upon which he was sought to be made liable. He admitted that the signature to the I O U. was a genuine one, and he accounted for it by stating that he carried on at the back premises of the deceased the business of a dealer in metal, and that, as metal was frequently brought for him while he was absent from home, it was his custom ta leave pieces of paper with his name on them, in order that if any persons brought metal for sale the quantity should be placed over his name, and when these papers were shown to hiim on the following day or any other time he knew the amount he had to pay. With regaid to his alleged adnission of the debt, he declared that it had - no reference to this I 0 U, of the existence of which he was totally ignorant, but to another debt due totbe deceased, frmxn whivh he bad been xelemaed by the operation of the Insolvent Court; but he said he did not desire to deprive the children of the' amount, and w'as willinig to ,ay s,if the legacy and the amount due for 'his wifes servees were 'taken intoaccount. The-defendant was cross-examined-atconsiderable length, but he persisted in the 'statements he had made, and his evidence was confirmcd in soiie respects by other witnesses who were eammined. Seojeant S E made a most powerful reply upon the whole clase, ancl he pPrticularly observed - -npon the total absence of motive on the part of the plaintifts for acting in the manner it was suggested they must have done by the defendant. Their only object was .to realize the estate of the deceased for the benefit of the famnily, and what possible interest, he asked the jury, could they have had m committing i forgery and fraud of this description with a viev to obtain 501. from a maan whom they well knew to be in distressed circumstances, and not likely, if the claim were ever so just, to settle it very readily? He urged that the case of the defendant was improbable in the very highest degree, and he said it was much more likely that aman in his condition should have resorted to the desperate expedient of declaring that the I 0 U was a forgery, in order to avoid payment of the amount, than that the plainti3i; should .have committed so serious a crime as the one imputed to them, without, as it appeared to him, any assignable motive. The learned JU1DGE, in summing up, said it was quite clear that to whichever side the jury gave a verdict they must at the same time declare that there was deliberate perjury on the other. The facts did not admit of any explanation, and there could be no donbt'that upon one side or the other there must have been wilful and deliberate perjury commiited. l'he jury retired at 5 o'clock, and weie in deliberation for nearly an hour and a half, when they were taken to the Judge's lodgings and gave a verdict for the Plaintiif;. M&r. Justice (.,OLERIDGE, when the verdict had been returned, addressed the jury, and said he could not help expressing his opinion that lthey had come to a right conclusiono
NOREFOT.K rtRefltrr CABRRUCtE. LUUVAw 92: The comnission for the county of Cambridge was duly opened yesterday afternoon, and at 10 o'clock to-day tho learned judges took their seats in their respective courts, the Chief Justice presiding at .YisiPrius and 3fr. Justice Wightman on the Crown side. The entry in the former consists of one common and three special jury causes, and the calendar contains the nauneS of 18 prisoners, the principl charges being 1 of burglary, 1 of housebreaking, 1 of bigamy, 3 of arson, 2 of rape, and 1 of perjury. The other cases were of an ordinary character. John Cranwell, aged 40, surrendered on two indictments, found at the last assizes for this county, charging him respectively wvith having feloniously received a quantity of timber and 15 barrels of cement, which had been stolen in June last from the premises of the Eastern Counties Railway at Ely. Mr. Naylor appeared for the prosecution; and Mr. Power and Mr. Metcalfe defended the prisoner on both charges. It appeared that the prisoner is a respectable carpenter and publican at Ely, keeping a yard in which wood is occasionaly left by his neighbours for the purpose of being broken up for firing. In June last some works were going on at the Ely station, and the prisoner sent oRe Benstead there with a cartto fetch away some firewood. About the same time soieu of the railway servants, taking advantage of the occasion, helped themselves to some substantial timber, some portions of which were loaded on a cart boy one Dixon, a porter, and taken by a man nanied lupaome to theyardof the prisoner, and there broken up. The c-ase, in so far as the implication of the prisoner with any goilty knowledge touching the latter transaction, rested almost exclusively on the testimony of Lupsome (Dixon having been convicted on a former occasion), hut the account hegave of the matterwas altogether insufdicient, and, after a bnef deliberation on the par t he the jury, a verdict of ZNot Guilty was retrned. This being the case, Dlr. NA.YLOR said that, as the second case appeared to him to rest entirely on the evidence of accomplices, though in some respects it was stronger than the first, he should not offer any evidence in support of it. The prisoner was thereupon also Aequitted on the second indictment, to the apparent satisfaction of many friends in c ourt. James Newman was indicted for wilfully setting fire to a stack of straw, the property of Mr. Fison, at Horningsea. Mr. W. Cooper appeared for the prosecution, and Mr. Naylor defended the prisoner. On the 'th of November last several youths of the village of Horningsea, including the prisoner, attempted to set firv to a small stack of hauln, in celebration of Guy Fawkesday, but without effect, as the straw was damp. In the evening of that day a man named Cousins was sittin; a' the door of his cottage when his attention was attracted by two boys passing over a gate into a field, through whichi theylwent to a further field, where there was a stack of straw. He saw one of them draw a match against his arm and set fire to the stack. He swore to the two boys before the magistrtes, who, however, only committed one of them, the prisoner, to stand his trial. The evidence of Cousins was so unsatisfactory that it more than justified the cautious opinion of the prosecutor, Mr. Fison, that he would not believe the man on his oath. As Cousins was the only witness who spoke to the identity of the prisoner, ES LoRDs=P directed a verdict of Acquittal, which the Jury readily found. Nisi PRius COURT.-(Beforc the Cmnr JUSTICE, and Special Juries.) EUTCUINSON V. THE BASTERN COUTIES sLWUL-VAY CO3PAN-Y. Mr. O'Malley and Mr. Couch were counsel for the plaintiffs; MLr. Serjeant Byles and Mr. Tozer appeared for the defendants. This was an action on behalf of the widow and three children of a farmer named Hutchinson, to recover compensation for his death, alleged to have been occasioned, while travelling on the Eastern Counties Railrway, through the negligence of that company.- The defendants pleaded "Not Guilty," and that the. deceased, at the time he met his death, was not lawfully in their carriage. It appeared that in March last Mr. Hutchinson repaired to St. Ives-market, from the neighbouring town of AIarch, with a " return market-ticket," issued at single fare, and, having purchased a cow, he placed her in a track on a mixed coal and cattle train, then about to start for March. Being anxious to get home with his purchase, the deceased, with two others, similarly situated, obtained leave from the stationmaster to do so, and he accordingly got up on the break, which was attached to the end of the train, consisting of upwards of 30 carriages. To the oe 'oack of this break no guard was attached as was usu, and it so happened that when the engine bore down on the train for the purpose of shunting it, the deceased was not aware of its approach, as his fellow passen-ers were, and the result was that he was precipitated head'foremost to the ground in consequence of the shock and the want of the guard, and there received injurie which led to his death. On the part of the defendants it was contended that they were not guilty of negligence; that the deceased had by inattention contributed to the accident; *and that, as a fact, he had improperly obtained leave to ride on the train In question, on the erroneous representation that he had a drover's ticket. The CmEF JusTicE left it to the jury, on the conflicting statements, to say whether the deceased had received permission to ride on the train with the ticket he had. If so he was lawfully there, and the verdict would then turn on thequestion of negligence. If the jary thought the compan,y had beenguilty of negligence in omitting to provide a guard, they would say so by their verdict; but it must be borne in mind that this was not an ordinary passenger train, and that the presence of the guard or bar across the opening of the break intended for the accommodation of the company's servant, and not of the public, might be a source of inconvemence. Then again, if the deceased by inattention to the warning rattling of the trucks which had reached his fellow-passengers, and by his want of caution had contributed to the accident, the verdict ought to be for the defendants, as in that case, whether negligent or not, they would not be liable. The jury deliberated some time, and ultimately found all points in favour of the plaintiffs, awarding 2001. comnpensation to the widow, and 4001. to the children. EWEN V. BOTHwAY. Air. Serjeant Wells and Mr. Worlledge appeared for the plaiatiff, and Mr. O'Malley and Xr. Couch for the delnat. This was an action brought to recovar 3001. on a bond, to which the defendant pleaded noon est factunr; secondly, that hehad been induced to execute the bond through the fraud of the plaintiff and others in collusion with hin ; and a third plea, byway of defence, on equitable grounds, the substance of which was, that the defendant being entitled to property in reversion, and anxious to borrow i001. thereon, applied to Messrs. Stoirton and Key in November, 1854, they being then practising as solicitors at Holbeach; that Mr. Key agreed to advance the sum required to the defendant as from a Mr. Musson, and that on the payment thereof to the defendant Mr. Key placed before him, and induced him to execate, a mortgage and abond for 3001., with an endorsement charging the same on his reversion, both of which documents he represented as constituting the security to Mr. Musson for the advance by- him, and which advance, when the reversion fell in, he (the defendant) duly discharged; that afterwards, however, Messrs. Sturton and Key becoming bankrupts absconded, when it was discovered for the first time that the bond was, in fact, a fraudulent document purporting to secure the advance of 300g. to the plaintiff. The effect of this was that the defendant gave two securities to two different parties that to Mr. Musson being the real transaction, while tha; to Mr. Ewen was an imaeinary one altogether, but no doub; put forward by Mr. Key, in order to cloak somne previous fraud practised by him on that gentleman. When the nature of the case was explained, The CnsEF JUSTIOE said that, as Mr. Key was the agent of both parties, andhad, infact, cheated both, each being entirely innocent, as was admitted on allhands, ho would suggest to them the wvisdom of settlingthis unfortunate loss between them, wvithout going into further expense and litigation, as it appeared that there were cross-demurrers. The best way for both would be ,to divide the loss. The learned conisiel, after a little bargaining, agreed to leave the matter to the learned judge, who at once said. "Then, I decide that the defendant shall pay 1501. to the plaintiff, and that each party shall bear his own costs." A verdict was thereupon taken for the plaintiff, pro fornw2 for 150M., as a security for the payment of that sum, but without costs. His LonDsirrp then took severalleriminal cases, and with his aid the calendar. was nearly cleared before the day closed.

COUBTOFBANEBUrPTCY, Bas nghaU-srAe, March 20. IS REI BERNARD HAGEN. __ - . 'r '- ' : ! (Before Mr; Cormnmhtnrv F.A xR A ThC bankrupt was a merchant and importer, at Aldermanbury. This was the certificate meeting. A secondclass certificate was granted. LN ILE VIRTUL The bankrupt Nkras an undertaker, of lgewman-street, Oxford-street. This was the adjourned examination meeting. The ituperfect state of thebeankrupt's books had rendered many formermeetingsnecessarv. It nowappeared y the accounts furnished by Messrs. Harding ad Pnlleii that the estate would realize about 20s. in the pound, and that the profits exceeded the expenditure; but to ascertain these acts it had been necessary to investigate the bankrupt's books for 16 years. But for the irregular state of the bankrupt's books, which kept himn in ignorance of the real state of nis affairs, he might have avoided bankruptcy. The bankrupt passed.
POLICE. MAII S .IlousE-John Hall, charged with having been in possession of a large qrantity of galddnst, -which was stolen by accomplished thieves in its transit from London to the continent, was brought before the LounD 1LLyou for further examination. Mr. Bodkin appeared for the prosecution; M1r. Lewis attended for the prisoner. M1r. Bodkin said, he had several witnesses present to add to the number of those already examined in the case, but he thought that, under eXiSting circumstances, it might prejudice the ends of justice to call them until an investigation which was in progress should have attained a greater degree of 3nuturity. He believed that after the interval of another week he should be in a condition to perfect the case, and he regretted that the absurdity of the new act of Parliament I made it necessary to remand a person under charge from week to week, instead of the old practice of remanding hima fir the tern necessarily required for a strict inquiry into -particulars, and adapted to the serious nature of an accusation. :re admitted.that the. Prisoner bad been a long time in prison, and that the solicitor for the defence might reasonably complain of the delay; but he put it to the Lord Ma yor whether an adjournment would not be justified by the evidence already given; by the bond fide course taken for the prosecutors, sLowing their sincerity in the whole course of the proceedings; and by the great public importance of the transactions involved, which demanded that more than ordinary pains should be taken to bring home the guilt to the real deUnquents. He felt confident that the Lord Mayor would not hesitate to order auother Iremand under these circumstanoee. The LoP. MAYoa asked what time lUr. Bodkin would require to show that the prisoner was identified with the matter of the robbery ? 3Mr Bodkin replied that in the course of eight days, during 'which the greatest activity should be used, he should be able to connect the prisoner to the satisfaction of his T Lordsbip with teh fact of the robbery, or submit the case as it was for decision, as to the taking of bail, or the discharge froin custody. Mr. Lewis said that Mr. Bodkin had made similar promises after the several examinations his client had undergone almost in every instance. These remands were not to be justified by the sort of evidence which had already been brought forward, and he considered that there was a peculiar unfairness in the successive applications for adjournnment, especially as the prisoner had not been allowed to put in bail, notwithstandingthe admission of bail in the first instance, and the punctual appearance of the prisoner at the appointed moment. As the case had received no additional strength from the timie of the first accusation, it was lut fair that the prisoner should at the present moment be discharged. 3Mr. Bodkin.-Discharged! ;3r. Lewis.-Yes. I cail for his immediate discharge. The,e is not a tittle of evidence to identify him with the roblery of the golddust, or with any transaction connected with it. There has beennothingbroughtforwardinevidence to prove that he has been more than a dealer in gold. Thera has not been evidence even to show that the golddust alleged to have been in the possession of my client had beea Ftolen in this country. xWhat pretext, then, can tlhere be for keeping him in prison, unless, indeed, his detention may be used to excite suspicion and add to prejadice 7 The LoRD KvYOR said, his obiect was to do what, as a magistrate, he was expected, and what he knew he ought, to do in a caseof any greatimportancetothe public, to the prosecutors, and to the prisoner himself. Mr. Lewis had forgotten, in his argument, the application of the case as respected the conmmunity, and had made an ingenious appeal on behalf of his client, steering clear of the othier prominent features of the case. The article which had been stolen was, as everybody knew, easily convertible into gold, presenting a different appearance from its first condition; and the difficulties of tracing it to its first form were so great that, under the existing circlunstances, every,facility a magistrate cvlild render ought to he given to those who were so deeply interested in the investigation. As to the continuous imprisonment of the accused, that was necessarily incidental to a person brought up in such a position; at the same time, it was, he knew, at variance with the principles of English law that a man should be incarcerated for a length of time without strongly grounded reasons for his incarceration. He had taken all these things into consideration, and was prepared to meet the case before he sat that day; and ho must say that, in his opinion, the ends of justice were not likely to be promoted by alowing bail to be taken for the appearance of the prisoner, whose case, he must tell Mr. Lewis, was different in its circumstances from what it appeared to be when securities wereaccepted. He, at the same time, would intimate to Mfr. Bodkin that if, on' tbe day to whichithe prsponer should be remanded, evidence were not forthcoming more closely conmecting the prisoner wfith the ciiminal transactions which had taken place, either bail would be received ora discharge would be granted. Mr. Lewis said, his client was likely to be injured by not being at large to prepare the means of defence. The oIOBD MKYon did not think so. -He was sure that when a man vwas out on bail he had- better opportunities of defeating justice. . the Mr. BodLin assured theCord Mayor that the prosecators were actively engaged in pursaing inquiries of'the most important kind connected with the subject of the robbery, and that everything should be done to complete the evidence. The LORD MAyoa then remanded the prisoner until this day week. Mr. HItnphries, jun., who attended for 'the prosecution of the prisoner on a different charge, said-he did not consider it necessary, as the prisoner was remanded, to oppose the application of 3ir. I ewis. The prisoner wtas then removed from the bar. GUIDmLnI.-Mnr. Morris, a-poor widow, of very respectable appearance, applied for assistande under the following circumstances:-She stated that her husband had been for nearly 20 years storekeeper'tb the city police force, and since his death she had received 5s. a-week from the police fund; but that, having been left with 11 children eight of whom were at home, she was driven to great distress. She had had 18 children, and 14 of them were born wlsile her husband was in the police force. Sirice his death she had striven very hard to maintain herself and family by shirt-making, in which she was assisted by her daughter, a girl of 17 years of age, whose health was very delicate. There were six children at home, and aJl of them under 13 years of age. Sir F. G. Moos asked her if she had got any of them into a charity school, where they would be taught and clothed? Mrs. Morris said, she had got her children educated at .free schools, but not at charity schools, where they gave clothes also. Sir F. G. Moos advised her to apply to the deputv of the ward she lived in, and state she had been sent by him (Sir F. G. Moon). Mr. Rowe, the summoning officer of the court, said, the applicant lived outside the city boundary, and he feared the deputy would find a difficulty in complying with the worthy alderman's request. Sir F. G. Moox said, that did not matter. Here was a case that should be an exception to the rule. The applicant had a claim on the city. Her husband had served 20 years in the police force, and it was not because she happened to live a few doors out of the city that no assistance should be given to her. He directed Mr. Rowe to make inquiries into the case, with a view to ascertain whether something could not be done thatwouldpermanently benefit her condition. In the meantime, he gave her 5s. from the poor-box for her imnmediate wants, andtold her to come up again in a few days, when if nothing else could be done he would give her a liberal donation. MAP.LBor,oU G.u-sTR r.-lWilliam Barry, was charged with robbing Ben Caunt, landlord of the Coach and Horses, St. Martin's-lane. In the first instance Ben Caunt obtained a peace warrant against the prisoner for threatening to smash his head with a bottle, but on meeting with him on Wednesday he gave him into custody for felony. The prosecutor stated that he went with his wife into a publichouse kept by a brother pugilist, named Langham, and while there the prisoner, put his hand into his (prosecutor's) pocket,, and from a quantity of sovereigns he had there .took five, - and some silver. His 'wife, who 'saw the. robbery, made the prisoner take his hand out of her husband's pocket, and prosecutor havingfound out what the prisoner was doing immediately knocked him down. After this the prisoner swore he would knock his brains out with a soda-water bottle. N'one of the money, which was scattered on the floor from the prisoner's hand, had been recovered. 'Mrs. Caunt proved the robbhery, ind also that she saw the money fall from the prisoner's- hand on the floor. The prisoner denied the charge, and was remanded for a week. WonsnSTr-suTv.-William Brendall, a disbanded. Tower Hamlets Militiaman, was charged with robbery. Mr. William Jones conducts, at Hoxton, the business of a widow lady named Tamsett, residing at Brighton, and while enga"ed in the rear of the premises between 7 and 8 Clock onthe preceding evening, hearing the maid servant's window opened, he looked up, and saw the prisoner jump out en to the leads of the kitchen below it. Hoe asked him what the deuce he meant by larldng with the girls in that way, and ordered him down, on which the prisoner, instead of descending by a large tree,- as he might have. done, made his way into the remises of a neighbour, and there dropped from a high wal into the next street. This seemed so suspicious as to give Mr, Jones another idea of the-matter,' and he therefore foUowed thep'risoner, who took iapidly to his heels, turned acorner sharply, then suddenly stopped, and walked deliberately back again towards hin, as though nothing had occurred. Mr. Jones collared hisn, demanxiing what he had been about, and, on the. prisoncr's professing ignorance, lie was about to let him gQ, when-two or three of the custoeuers of the house rln up, and secured the prisoner npon the charge of burglary. Itthenappearedthat one ofthe' servants, named Rose Zillah Johnson, had gong , Istam-1 to put the rooms ii order, 'when she found the doors of her own edroom and the drawingroom wide open; thismuch) ur-- prised her, as she knew t'ey had been- closed jut-b. before,. but she shut one-door to without observation- and;the next moment caught sight of the prisoner stealtbily emerging from l,r. Joncs's room, upon tiptoe, ' and vith a t#Pcheon in his handL She screamed, andthe prisoner rashed pasther, rasing the truncheon as if to strike her as he did so, bat the girl was so terrified that she fell down the stairs, and before reaching the bottom heard her window flung up and the prisoner leap through it and come down on the leads. She raised an alam, and the prisoner was secured as described by a constable, who wastaking him to the station, when the prisoner ierked a bagfuJl of keys from his pocket and flung them away. The officers regainedthe keys, and lodged the prisoner in the station, where, upon tearching hnn, he discovered a purse with money in it, a ring, three bracelete, a brooch, and.other articles upon him; and in going back to the house hIr. Jones's bedroom was found in a stste of the geatest confusion, the bedding throwrn abont, the drawers forced open with a chisel or crovbar,the lock being neaMrly torn of f n them, and, in additiomL the aticles before mentioned, a watchp.was also discovered to have been stolen. . Thee riadner denaed the charge, decLaring he had founa the tings in his possession outside the house, bunpthe-facts were too clearto admit of afny doubt, and he was comsh6ttedtgd that day eweek for the completion of the depositone. .T AES.-John X esser, of Nos. 19 anrd 20, King street, Cambercial-road east, in thee paish of St. uforge,n aiddlesex, optician and house owner; James Messer,: landlord of the Duine of York pubechnotse, in Shepherd street, Oxfordstreet; and Robert Walter Messer, .optioian, described as being in the employent of th r.

St. George-in-the-East, which charged the defendants that they, being the children of James John Mtesser and Darcy Mfeeser, poor persons not able to work, and the defendants being of sufficient ability to maintain their parents, did -rneglees to zelieye them at their ownTchargfe. . t- The defendants, three well-dressed men, who appeared to have enjoyed the good things of this life, ere seated in ront of the table; their venerable-looking mother, 7D -years of age, was near them in astateof great agistratn, and the tears otrickling dawn her cheel;-s. Tse father of the defendants, who was sdpported on crntches, and is 72 gears of age, has seen better days, and wvas pow;erfuilly afiboted. lhr.Coombs stated that heD was directed by the board of guardians of St. George-in-the-Eiast to ask the magistrate to make an order on the deFendants to maintain their parents, w,ho had been chargeable to the parish since the 1st of December last. The relief granted to the aged couple amounted to 3s. 6d. per week, and the arrears due to the parish amounted to 21. 12s. d. All the defendants were in goodieircumstances. Mr. John Messer was the owner of house property in the parish, carzied on a profitable business, and was rated to a large amount in the parish books. Mr. James Messer was the landlord of a publichouse at the west end of the town, and Mr. WalterRobert Messer, whose residence was unknown, was in the employment of Mr. Ross, the optician in Featherstone-buildtng-s, and in the* receipt of good -a-ages. He had applied to the defendants to relieve the parish of the burden of maintaining their parents, but they would come to no arrangement, and would not pay the arrears. Mr. Janies John Messer said, the defendants were iis' sons, and well able to maintain hin and their mother. Witness was old and infirm, and obliged to throw himself on the parish. (Here the oldr man cried.) Mr. James kept a publichouse; Mr. John carried on the business of an optacian in King-street, St. George-in-the-East, where he had a nice place; and Mr. Robert was a journeyman, earning good wages. He would not have troubled his children if he could have helped it. He had been a good father to them, and put them in the way of maintaining themselves and families in a comfortable manner. Mfr. LVGsLkX said, he would now hear anything the defendants had to say. They would be sworn and examined as witnesses. MIr. Robert Walter hfesser volunteered himself as a witness. He got into the witness-box and was sworn. He sud, heuwas in the employment of Mir. Ross, Featherstone- iuildings, Holborn, and was paid 71d. per hour. Mr. 1INGFIL-Why, Mr. Ross is the most celebrated gptician in London. I am sure you get good wages there. What are your average wages ? Mr. Robert Messer.-I never take a note of my average weekly wages. Mr. LVGLIAM.-How much per day? Mr. Robert Messer.-Well, Sir, about 5s. lOd. per day; not more. M r. INGHASr.-How many hours per day do you work for 74d. per hour ? Mr. Robert messer.-10, Sir; not irore. Mr. LNG'Une-That will be .5s. 103d. per day, or 35s. 3d. per week. lr. Robert Messer.-Only nine hours on a Saturday. Mrr. LYGnAM.-Very good-not much below an average of 35s. per week. Are not your earnings very close on 21. per week? Mr. Robert Messer.-Yes, sir, say 27. per week; but I have two children to support. MIr. IN;Gn._L- How old are your children? Mr. Robert 'Messer.-One is three years old and the other 12 months. IIr.IL'GnAisL-That will do ; stand down. Will the other defendants be sworn? Mr. John 3lesser and Mr. James Messer said, they must decline giving any evidence. Mr. LYG1LV. L-Have you anything to say why I should not make an order upon you to support your aged parents, and pay the arrears? Mr. John Xesser.-We are both of us willing to pay our pro rtion. Coosnbs proposed 7s. 6d. per week for the maintenance of the old people, or 2s. 6d. per week from each of their sons. Mr. LNGHr.-They cannot have less. What do the sons say to this? Mr. John fesser said he would willingly pay 2s. 6Ld. per week, and also the rent of a room for his parents, because he was a little richer than his brothers. Mr. LzGHAL. -Very well; I make an order for the payment of 2s. 6d. per week on each of you for the support of your parents, the payment of the arrears due to the parish, -and te costs. X-.

SouTrwvRK.-William Hands, a well-dressed, muscular looking man, described onthe charge-sheet as a watchmaker, residing in George-street, Borough-road, was brought before Mrr. A'EECKETT, charged with committing a murderous assault upon Emma Hands, his wife. Mr. A'BEcr sentenced hinato si;n months' hard labour in WEandsworth House of Correction. ILAmInErH-Mr. George Levis, of the firm of Lewis and Lewis, attornevs, in Ely-place, Holborii, attendedbefore the Hon. G. C. XORTON on behalf of Mliss Jane Oakford, a lady residing at 98, York-road, LambetfL, to mieet a charge of felony, preferred against his client under the following somewhat singular circumstances .- Mr. Lewis, addressing the magistrate, said that in the counrse of the afternoon of the day before a policeman was brought to the residence of his client by a gentleman under whose protection she had been for some years, and she was given into custody by that gentleman, or was about to be given into custody of the officer, when she requested to be allowed to put on her bonnet. This perminssion was granted to her. The lady managed to lower herself by means of a rope from the back window, and, having gained the street, got into a cab and drove to his (Mr. Lewis's office. She then instructed him (Mr. Lewis) to write to the gentleman, to say that she should -be in attendance at -this court at 2 o'clock on that day to meet the charge of stealing the watch orany other charge he might think proper to prefer against her, and that the reason she left her ome was, that she did not like to be incarcerated in the cell of a police station for a whole night. William Oaks, 30 L, the officer engaged in the affair, said that about 1 o'clock on the day before the Rev. Mr. Harris, a clergyman belonging to the church of England, whose livings, he understood, were in Wales or close to it, but who was residing at 9S, York-road, Lambeth, called at the Tower-street station and said he required the assistance of an officer respecting the loss of his gold watch and appendages, and he (Oaks) was ordered by the inspector on tation On reaching the house the rev, gentleman told him that on coming downtobreakfast on that morning he left his watch safe inhis bedroom, and onhis retulrnhemissedit. He then examined his boxes, and missed several articles of property from themwhich no one but MissOakford co-uld have taken, he should therefore give her into custody for stealng his gold watch and appendages. The lady declared that Mr. Harris had given her the watch, and said she had been hiving with him, as his wife for some years, but wished to get rid of him. At this time the lady went into the back parlour, and, having remained there some minutes, Mr. Earris knocked at the door several times and called out "Jane ! Jane !" but received no answer. He (Oaks) asked the rev, gentleman whether there was a possibility of the lady ma;king her escape 9.-and he replied not, for that the windows of the apartment were at least 20 feet from the ground. Witness went outside, and seeing a rope dangling from the window at once concluded that the bird had flowvn. MEr. Harris, finding that the lady had effected her escape gave him and another constable who was present at the time orders to apprehend her wherever he found her. Mr. NORTON thought the best course was for the officer to proceed to the house in York-street and inform the gentleman that Mr. Lewis was in attendance to meet the charge. Oaks accordingly started on his misrsion, and on his return said he saw both the rev. gentleman and the lady at the house, and apparently on the most friendly terms; and the former said that it was not his intention to pursue the matter further, and thus has ended this delicate-though to a clergyman-not creditable affair.

JIYGLA.JD AND A3aERICA. (PROM OUR OWN Co0RESPONDENT.) NEW YORIK, MARCE 4. I have frequently thought that a few extracts from the condensation of European news published in the American journals on the arrival of a steamer would give you a better insight into the manner in which public opinion is unconsciously guided than anything else I could say or do. We have, for instance in a leading New York journal, on the aval of the last steamer, the following preCious piece of gossip:- " The most important news by this arrival is, that Great Britin is in a state of intense excitement on the subject of a war with the United States. According to the Atlantic's advices it was reported on Liverpool 'Change that Mr. Buchanan had demanded his passports, and his absence fromI ady Palnerston!s soir6c was attributed to the personal misunderstanding between Lord Clarendon and himzelf. Clarendon is said to have spoken in a most imperious manner to M1r. Buchanan, which Mr. Buchanan promptly checked by closing the interview. A telegraphic slip, forwarded per Atlantic, after our parcels by tbat steamer were closed, mentioned, en the authority of the London Morning Advertisc-, that Sir Henry BuIwer, in concert with a member of Parliament of great diplomatic experience, is endeaoaring to arrive at a solution of the difficulty between the nidted States and Great Britai, which may be more acceptable to bcoth countries than the plan of arbitration.". Such stories as these put forth remain uncontradicted for a little time, and, perhaps, with many readers are never inquired into. Since my last letter a portion of the correspondence of which I sent you the resumn has been published. The rest (that relating to the legal proceedings in New York, Philadelphia, and Cincinnati) has not yet been sent in. I understand that it will be. There has also been further correspondence published relative to the Central American questions. I will endeavour to state briefly how these matters now stand, so far as the correspondence is made public. The new letters about Central America only relate to the proposal to arbitrate. Issue having been taken upon the fact whether any such proposition was ever made, it now appears that Mr.. Buchanan, as early as November 21, 1854, reported to Mr. Marcy an interview with Lord Clarendon, in which the latter " intimated that it might be desirable to have the opinion of a third Power on the true construction of the Convention." Mtr. B3uchanan considered this " as a mere intimation on his part," and "playfully observed that it would now be difficult to find an impartial umpire, as they (Great Britain) had gone to war with our (the United States) arbitrator, the Emperor of Russia." Again, on the 2dof November, 1855, Mr. Buchanan reports another interview, in which Lord Clarendon saild that when two Governments disagreed about the construction of a treaty, the best and most natural mode was to refer the question to a third Power." On the 9th of November Mr. Buchanan writes,-" I had an interview with Lord Clarendon yesterday by appointment. He then said, about thece Central American questions, the best mode of settling them is by arbitration. I replied, there was nothtng to arbitrate. He said the true construction of the treaty was a proper subject for arbitration. I told him I did not consider it a question for arbitration at all." And on the 5th of February, 1856, after the speech of Lord Clarendon in the House of Lords, Mdr. Buchanan writes to his Government that he had reported "in the most faithful manner every conversation!' between Lord Clarendon and himself " on the subject of a refer. ence of these questions to a friendly Power." On the 8th of February he writes again, detailing a long interview with Lord Clarendon in which he says,-"He for the first time informed methat he had zddressed a despatch to Mr.'Crampton on the subjdct, with instructions to him to read it to you." On the 27th of February last, at 11 o'clock in the evening, MIr. Crampton sent this despatch to Mfr. 31arcy, with a note, saying that the despatch had been received in December last, and adding, "I regret not having made you this communication before; but the truth is, that the last paragraph of thie despateh escaped my attention until I referred to it lately." As the despatch is very short, having but three paragraphs, it is a little remarkable that :Ir. Crampton should have entirely overlooked the second. I enclose the whole document . ",Lop.D CLAREuDO2 TO MRL CRAaPToN. "Foreign-office, Nov. 10, 1855. *"Sir,-hMr. Buchanan having, in the course of conversation a few days ago, adverted to the impression that would be created in the United States by the non-settlement of the Central American question, I again assured him that England had no wvish to extend her influence, or to obti;n any territory inthat part of the world; and I reminded him that as the difference between this country and the United States turned solely upon the interpretation of the treaty of 1850, Ihad offered, on the part of Her Majesty's Government, to submit the case to the arbitration of a third Power, but that, he had declined the offer. Her Maiesty's Government, I said, would still abide by that offer, and thought it would be the fairest and most amicable manner of arriving at a settlement of the question. Mr. Buchanan said he would make it known to his Governm3ent, and you are in3structed to commu3nu3icate this despatch to M. Marcy. ' I san, with great truth and regard, Sir, your most obedient, humble servant, "J. F. Crampton, E3sq. &c. CLAREMDON." The offer to arbitrate seems to be favourably received, so far as public opinion has expressed itself. You will observe the speeches of Senator Seward and the comments of the press. But I donot think that the Adninistration are satisfied with it, or with the manner in which it has been made. There is a disposition to malke its detention a personal matter, and to impute motives to MIr. Crampton which no unprejudiced person can ascribe to him. Walker's unceremonious annexation of Alosquito to Nicaragua is likely to still more complicate the Central American question. It comes very opportunely for the Administration if they have any wish for war. A project is under discussion of forming an alliance with Nicaragua, but no progress has been made in it. It does not look well for Walker that the four other Central American! States have formed a separate alliance, and that Costa Rica has twice repelled his advances for official relations. The Nicaraguan :Minister, French, was recalled some time since, and I learn that it is contemplated to send Mr. Norberto Raminez, formerly President of San Salvador, twice President of Nicaragua, and now Secretary of State of Nicaragua, in his stead. Thus stands this question so far as the documents have been made public, and the purposes of the Government can be learnt. The President originally contemplated sending in a strong message with the correspondence, recommending preparations for hostilities. The idea was abandoned, and the same thing has been indirectly attempted through Administration members of Congres. The Senate have passed a bill for buildinmg ten new war steamers, and the Secretary of Wax asks an appropriation for Executive disposition of t3,000,000. By the public these measures are regarded as only precautionary. The Republican journals charge them as an attempt to. distact public attention from Kansas, and some of the Know-nothing joulnals say that they look to an increaseof appropriation intheyearof anelection. The Democzatic journals supportthe Administration with unanimity, and perhaps the truth lies between all these authorities. The xwhole of this dispute really turns upon the question whether the Island of tuatan was or was not a part of the dependencies of the Belize when the treaty of 1850 was signed, for that treaty substantially takes away the sting rom the protectorate. This is a question more between Honduras and Great 33ritain than between the United States and Great Britain. Why cannot an arbitration be had with Honduras to determine to whom this island belongs, with the understanding that if it belongs to Honduras it shall be given up ? - If it belongs to Great Britain it was hers before the treaty, and at that time "; a dependency of British Honduras?' (in the language of Sir Henry Bulwer's declaration). As to the enlistment question, the only important document not particularly alluded to in my last letter is MIr. Marcys despatch of the 28th of December, in which the American case is elaborately and ably summed up. It has united public sentiment in favour of the Admiistration, although such very respectable authority as the YAatioinat Intelli4jencer says that the demands seem "exaggerated beyond what the exigencies of the occasion would seem to have requirect" It seems that, when the Cabinet at London expressed its regret at the infringement of the United States' law, it was also stated that any person so doing had acted without authority. When the evidence was subsequently discovered which is said to implicate MIr. Crampton, the American Go. verninent demanded to know whether he was authorized in what he did; and if so, that the Britisli Government should render 5ome satisfaction-not only for the violation of the municipal law, but for the infringement of the neutrality of the country. The question now turns upon these points-first, whether the acts proved constitute a violation of the statute (which is denied by Lord Csrendon, and < z >lt i,r !mnortwbich the conviction of the offenders gives to his opinion);I and whether, independently of municipal law, there has not been a violation of the sovereignty of the United States by an infringement of its neutrality, even though that infringement may have been done so carefully as to avoid the penalty of the law passed to protect the neutrnlity. No reply has been received to this despatch, which closes with a demand for the recall of Ai. Crampton and the offending consuls. It is not likely that Mr. Crampton will receive his passports till after the reply shall be received. Or if Great Britain even now should admit a violation of the sovereign rights of the United States as a neutral Power, the recall of Mr. Crampton would not be a necessity, notwithstanding Mr. Marcy's apparently unequivocal demand. Few persons in Washington anticipate trouble from either of these questions. Mr. Dallas, the newly-appointed Minister to London, sailed with his fa;mily in the Atlantic.
SOCIETY OF ARTS' EXAMINATIONS. The following correspondence has passed between the Secretary of the Liverpool Mechanics' Institution and the Secretary of the Sceiety of Arts:- " Liverpool Mechanics' Institution, M arch 5. "Sir,-As the condition which requires candidates for the approaching examnation to attend at the Society's house excludes from participation in it those institutions that are desirous of engaging in the competition but are not so fortunate as to be near enough to London, and as the scheme contemplates the holding of examinations in the provinces in after years, I wish to inquire if it has been found imprcticable to hold local examinations this year, and (if itbe notincompatible with the present arrangements) to request, on the part of this institation, which consists of above 2,200 members and schoLars, that its students may be exempted from attendance in London in June, and may be allowed to compete by means of papers to be sent from the Central Committee, and worked in the presence of a local committee having the confidence of the one in London, in the manner indicated on page2of the Memorandum on this subject, dated Nov. 8, 185, and under such other conditions for securing equality of competition as it may be thought proper to inpose. "h'is,institution has Large day schools attached to it, the pupils of which, I suppose, are eligible as candidates for examination. "I am, Sir, your obedient servant, "ASTRUP CARRIS, Sec. " P. L Neve Foster, Esq., Sec. Society of Arts.-' "Society of Arts, Adedphi, London, March 19. "Sir,-I have brought your letter of the 5th inst. under the notice of the Council of the Society of Arts, and I am instracted to say that the council very much regret they cannot comply with the request of the managers of the Liverpool Mechanics' Institution to alter the existing arrangements which have been made for holding the examinations at the Society's house in June next. The shortness of the intervening time would, of itsef, be sufficient to deter them from maling the change suggested. But, independently of this consideration, the Council of the Society of Arts are of opinion, that an examination conducted solely by means of printed questions and written answers thereto-the examiners and examined being far apart-may be open to grave objection. It would be diffleultto enforce, by means of committees variously constituted, and by no means equally zealous, the samle precise amount of stringent supervision over the candidates; and, without this, the most accurate examination of written answers transmitted from remote distances would be a fal1acious test of the actual relative merits of the candidates. Besides, no opportunity would thus be given for oral examination, which is an integral element of the Society's Examination Scheme. "I am farther instructed to bring under your notice a resolution of the Committee of the Leeds Mechanics' Institution, framed on the 26th nult. " ' That this committee cordialty approves of the scheme of examination Laid down by the Council of the Society of Arts in their .Touralas of February 22, 1856, and recommends that the scheme with its details be communicated to the yupils of the day and evening classes of this Institution, with the offer to pay a sum not exceeding 101. towards the expenses of sending four pupils to London for examination; the eligibility of such pupils to be determined by the headmaster of the school, along with the committee of the schools and classes, and that the examination do take place on Thursday, May the 15th.' "It thus appears that it is proposed to hold, in May next, a prelininary local examination of such candidates as may desire to compete for the society's certificates and prizes, and, from them, to select four candidates to be sent up to the society's general examination in June. The council are of opinion that a principle of the utmost value- and susceptible of the wdest development is involved in this resolution of the Lied's Mechanics' Institution-they believe its general adoption would be fraught with many and signal advantages. A previous local selection would, in many eases, save the exammners the troubleandirksomnoecz of ec=sining and rejecting candidates entirely unprepared to pass any examination whatever. It would m itself be a distinction for a young man to be selected to represent the institution of his native town at the Society of Arts! General Examination in London. "The council believe no' difficulty would be found in securing the services of wellqualified persons in the several ldcaities to conduct with eciency the preliminary local examinations. " The pupils of your day schools are eligible for examination. "cI am, Sir, youz obedient servant, P I.E V3 FOSTER, Sec. " The Secretary of the Mechauics'Institute, Liiverpool."

IEBLAND. THE PORTAELINGTON ETATES. (JEOX oUR OWN CORRYSPONDMT.) DUBLIN, THiURSDAY. MORPNflnG. A residue of the vast estates of the Earl of Portarling,ton, situate in the Queen's county, is to be sold by order of the Court in Henrietta-street on Tuesday, the 27th of May next. The net rental of the lands to be disposed of is close upon 1,2001. a-year. The agency of this property it was that, in. familiar phrase, first put the late John Sadleir upon his legs, and transferred him from a quarter sessions attorney to a magnate among Irish land agents. How well he discharged the trust reposed in himmay one day or another be brought to light among other revelations connected with his marvellous career in Ireland. The termination of the agency upon the estates being brought into the Encumbered Court was at the time a heavy pecuniary loss to lr. Sadleir, but, as after events proved, it was not long before he attained a still higher Position than a mere agent, and a much wider field for the scope of his ill-applied abilities. TIHE ILuSH JUDIcAL BEENCH. The grand jury of the county of Galway have p)resented their address to the Lord Chief lustice Lefroy. Irrespective of the compliment thus paid on a circuitwith which his Lordship has no professional connexion, the address is remarkable, as containing the signatures of no less than 11 Roman Catholic gentlemen, including the two county representatives and one of the borough members, Mr. Anthony O'Flaherty. TEIE UNIrD SnVIE C OLUB. The Lord-Lieutenant honoured this club with a visit on Wednesday. Upon entering the coffeeroom his Excellency observed Lieutenant (Redan) Massy, of the 19th Regiment, who has just arrived from the Crimea, and is now quite a military lion in Dublin.

MR. LA YARD AT ABBRDRBN. (BY =ECa TC =GPPH.) Yesterday Mfr. Layard, M.P., was reinstated as Lord Rector of Marischal College and University, Aberdeen. In the morning he was entertained at a public breakfast, .and had a most flattering reception. On the subject of the war he said, " There is every probability that by the end of the month we shall have a treaty of peace signed. Very few pnblic men desire war, and peace in the abstract is certainly more to be wiqhed for, but I have no confidence that the present peace will be upon the whole a satisfactory one, and there is scarcely a maan to be found from the Land'send to John-o-Groat's but would like another year of war (great cheering), and for these reasons-first, the political aspect of the question does not warrant us to expect a lasting peace, and, second, because there is a general impression that, now we are fully prepared for it, another years war would show the world that there is that in Bnglishmen which would conquer every difficulty. (Cheers.) If we have peace now matters will be left in pretty much the same state as that in which we found them. (Hear.) True, we have protected Turkey against Russian aggression in the Black Sea; but, so far as the great questions of civil and religious liberty are concerned, they remain pretty much the same as they were before the war began, and therefore, I think, the peace wil be premature." The iustallation took place at 2 o'clock in the great hall of the University, and was a most sucesscful affair.

This sentence speals more for " Fair. play's" ingenuity than for his love of fair-play.

.RAIKESS JOURYAL.* The Iandmarkz of our progress up to this time are pretty conspicuous, but, looking only to the space we have traversed in the last twenty years, it would be difficult to find better evidence than the volumes before us. Eere is a book of considerable interest in various particulars, yet of which the chief and strange attraction is this, that though referring to recent events it seems to be the production of the inhabitant of an earlier century. The writer is a modern antique, or, as he may be more properly termed, a contemporary who has become antiquated prematurely. The ordinaly literary sequence of the present reviewingthe past is in his case inverted, for the past is here givigs its notions of the present, and its notions are a literary curiosity, monumental and yet lively, a something between a joke *and an. anachronism. It is not the first occasion that such a phenomenon hasappeared. There have frequently been times when the stream of history became covered with a stagnant crust, and one such (it is just worth citing for a paraUel) was represented by the Memoirs of Philippe de Comites. Of himn Dr. Arnold remarks, in a well-known passage, the undoubting complacency of his allegiance to a Etate of things which was passing away. The knell of the middle ages has sounded, yet he has no other notions but such as they have tended to foster. But the medinval annalist, as we have now proof, was not more remarkable in this respect than this well-informed diner out of our own century. That respectable gentleman. whose portrait prefaces these volumes, and who attains the standard of a well-conditioned, well-preserved member of the best society, carried in his heart a profound conviction of the eternal fitness of the state of things in which he was nurtured, caredfor, and comforted. It matters not whence that state of things arose, or whether it was like anything before or since, whether it resembled the system of Bolingboke and the aspirations of Disraeli, or was an excrescence and a constraint on the party which adopted it; at all events, there it was, and there was Mr. Thomas Raikes, a devout believer in the existing delusion, and, when the stream of national life moved on and broke up the crust which imagined itself eternal, Mr. Thoman Raikes found his way to the bank, and insisted that the order of Providence was unsettled. It must by no means be inferred from what we are stating, that £r. Raikes was an incapable or unappreciated person. His jozwrta is better than the journals of certain personages of greater note. As for himself, he unquestionably floated among the cream of the cream. Though he had dormant relations with the City, he was a frequent guest at Oatlands. He gossipped with de Guiches and de Grammonts at VersaiUes. He was familiar with the loftiest dandies of St. James's-street and the most dilapidated debris of the Faubourg St. Germain. The Duke wrote him private letters; Brummell had praised his waistcoats; and he was in the habit of calling Count Pozzo di Borgo" Pozzo." Such proofs of his perfect ease at Corinlhian altitudes render him an unimpeachable interpreter of the sentiments of those who were placed in contact with him at that exalted level; while we find that, instead of seeing further than others, Mr. Raikes bears unconscious testimony to their shortsightedness, to the absurdity of their fears, and the vanity of their predictions. Hisjoutrnw extends from 1831 to 1847, whilethe present portion of it comes down to 1836. During the years which followed the Reform BiU the sinister auguries which these old gentlemen exchanged in confidence would have vied with Zadkiers Almanac. They seem to take a horrible pleasure in thrilling each other's nerves and crisping the venerable hairs on their respective " Georges." St. James's and St. Germains exchange awful warnings; and their denizens compete in alarming rumours, betraying that inclination which the fat boy in PiFcwick so deliberately expresses-" I wants to make your flesh creep." Thomas Raikes is himself an electric conductor between the two countries, aud is charged to and fro with a series of shocking aunouncements. On the 19th of May, 1832, he reports what the Duke of R, has said to Lord W-, that "Attwood and O'Connell will turn the scale in this country, and that if the Duke of Wellington took office " before a week was out he would be assassinated." By the third. reading of the Reform Bill on the 4th of June, " the House of Peers, as a deliberative body, is trampled under foot; it never again canbe a check to popular innovation." On the 12th, "Those who have money at conmandarebuyingfunds in America or in Denmark, which they think least exposed to political changes." In the meantime the cholera divides their apprehensions with the Reform B3ill, and its incidents are thus curiously connected together:-. "It is stated from Ireland that for some days past many of the country people are seen ranning over the midland counties, carrying with them pieces of burnin turf, a smnall piece of which they leave at every house, with the following exhortation :-' The plague has broken out; take this, and, while it burns, offer up seven paters, three ayes, and a credo, in the name of God aud the holy St. John, that the plague may be stopped.' The person leavig it lays each householder under an obligation to set fire to his piece of turf and run to seven other houseswhere no holyfire has been left, and leave it to each, under apenalty of falling a victim to the cholera himself. Mlen, women, and children are seen scouring the country in every direction with this charmed turf; one man had to run 30 miles before he could perform his task. The priests, however, pretend entire ignorance of the matter; and, when we reco6lect the bearing of the fiery cross in Scotland previous to a rising, there is too mnuch reason to fear that the ceremony has more of a political than a sanitary tendency." Croker was no exception when they were al of them croakers, for " no words can describe the desponding, hopeless view which he takes of all public matters; national ruin and bankruptcy with him are inevitable." When "the curtain drew up and discovered the Reformed Parliament assembled, the first object which presented itself was Mr. Cobbett seated on the Treasury Bench with the Ministers, from which he refused to move as he knew of no distinctionof seats inthatHouse." Onthe 27th of February, 1833, the following are the quotations of political stock:-"the aristocracy are hourly going downin the scale; Royalty is become a mere cipher. I was walkingthe other dayround the Royal Exchange, the encinlte of which is adorned with the statues of all our Kings ;" and here Raikes's experience rose ito a stream of prophecy, " only two niches," he says, "now remain vacant; one is destined to our present ruler, and that reserved for his successor is the last. Some peoDle might say it was ominous." Others, perhaps, wvould say that the omen was fulfilled when the Royal Exchange was burnt in 1838, within six months after the accession of her present Majestv. But this would not have contented Mr. Raikes. Had not Cooke a letter from his Grace the Duke of Wellington, in which he also writes as follows :-" We are going, but I think it will be gradually. There will be no catastrophe; we are not equal to one. We shall be destroyed by the due course of the law, unless the Virgin. of the Pillar or some miracle save us." For ourselves, who are bound to recognze in these words some trace of inspiration, may we hope the Virgin of the Pillar is a symbolic allusion to the statue nowin the area of the Exchange underwhose presiding influence we breathe not quite so fearfully ? If we cross over to France about this date with 3Ir. Raikes, we find other symptoms, if possible, still more disheartening. Paris has a splendid air of past magnificence; but, alas! it is now "the reverse of the Castle of Otranto-it is the abode of giants inhabited by pigmies." There had been a ball on the 9th of January, 1834, at the Tuileries, at which nearly 4,000 persons were present, some of whomwere quiteportentous. To give an idea of the company, Yarmouth said that he called in the morning, on his cosomaker to desire that his carriage, which required some little repair, might be ready at night, as he was going to tlle balL The coachmaker said, "That puts me in mind that I am also invited, and I must get my own carriage ready likewise." This state of social confusion is illustrated by a good story which entitles Thomas Raikes to a laugh at the expense of the shopkeepers. " It is said that a lady happened to complain the other night that her shoe pinched her, when her partner immediately presented his card of address as Cordonnier du ?OI, and offered to wait upon her the next morning." What a pleasing contrast to this is the neneage of the the De Guiches at Versailles, who decline all intercourse " with what is caUed the soit of the place, but ready to ;.'show s whose tastes coincide with their own, any marka of attention and civility." The following anecdote is not only " charac- teristic," but is told with a gusto:- "A Exglish family, Mr. and Mfrs.

Within the last two years Madame de C-, one of their whdieuucg, began to give balls, and it was observed that she irom that moment deserted :frs. MI ' assemblies. She did not hesitate to avow it, saying, ' Tant que je ne donnais rien, j'allaisvoir mes uais chez Madame D-, mais miaintenant, comme jo ne pourrais mas recevoir cette dame chez moi, je no vais plus cdez elle.P In the meantime there were corresponding manifestations at home. Pozzo even "thitnks the present state of England worse than if it was a republic, and the downfal of the House of Lords inevitable." This was in 1834. In 1835,-during the Duke's Administration, " they are betting two to one in their den, at :Brookes's that the Governmaent does not last two months." On the occasion of the death of the Duke of Beaufort, on the 5th of December in that year, we learn that he held a long and affectionate conversation with Lord Worcester, in which he earnestly entreated him to bring up the young Lord Glamorgan with care and attention, " as," said he, " we now live in times when his brilliant prospects may be changed, and no one knows how soon he may be reduced to live by his own exertions." Yet, notwithstanding these alarms and deathbed misgivings, we have a difficulty in determining the real groundwork of theprevaiIingterror. Themost serious inconvenience after al seems to be the invasion of good society by persons who'would be less conversant with its usages than the author. Our French Embassy, for instance, is besieged by such applicants forinvitations as a consequence of "our newlevelling system at home; such were never experienced here im the time of lady Elizabeth Stuart." In that golden age we should never have heard of the contemporary horror which is thus noted down on the 29th of March, 1836 : "As an instance of the levelling system now established in England, Mir. John Gully, orginally a common prizefighter in the ring, then a regular frequenter of Newvmsrket, inwhich capacity herealizedalarge fortne, and thence Fbecane MP. for Pontefract, was last Wednesday presented by Lord Morpeth at the tev6e, and was actually at the Queen's dravnng-room on the following day." These sentiments, at the best, are the traditions of an extinct school, or of a school which now-a-days keeps its traditions to itself. Their bald avowal strikes us as incongruous, for they are relegated to sects and coteries which have abandoned political hopes and live only on their recollections. No real Conservative at this day loolWsupon the Reform Bill as the ruin of his couitry, or conceives society to be uphleld by the inestimable privilege of "cutting"' those who are beneath him in the social scale. We are now adherents of alargercreed; webreathe a freer atmosphere, and can retort upon the exclusives the discomfort and disabilities of their exclusiveness. W%e can pity the Thomas Ralikes of 1830 more cordially, perhaps, than he would have pitied us when he prophesied our perdition and cut us with a sad serenity. We can reply-this most respectable gentleman was once our contemporary, and by the pace at which we are living he has become miurmmy already. We read his Jour2 ud, however, and advise others to do the same, not from undue admiration F of the writer, but because he has made many curious and amusing memoranda. The circles with which he associated, dined, and gossipped furnished him with a number of good stories, many of them relating to important personages, and which were well worth preserving; and, independently of the value of his Journal as a class representation of a transitional time, it abounds in illustrative tales and unfamiliar anecdotes. We havc, for example, a series of duels, suicides, and of the various horrors with which Mr. Raikes became conversant while residing in France, and which strikingly indicate its then state of society. We have further some remarkable statements of dreams and predictions, which are adapted for those in our own day who credit similar irregularities. We have the notes of an attentive observer of the tendencies of Louis Phi pe,.which are the more deserving attention becise they are the remarks of a critic who was close at hand and captiously candid. We must allow for lIr. Illaikes's preference for the elder Bourbons, but, admitting his predilections, we must do justice tobhis discernment, ie has two or three stories about Louis x VII., comparing him with Louis XIV., which confirm and give point to the received impressions concerning that Prince. Eere is a record of the adroitness of Louis XIV. in dealincg with the Jew, Samnuel Bernard - "Wh'en Louis XIV. in his latter days was pressed by foreign wars and in great distress for money, the famous Jew banker Samuel Bernard positively refused to make him any further advances; in this dilemma he concerted with Chamillart to appoint a meeting with the capitalist at Marly, and when, he was q4uitting the interviewas refractory as ever, the Bing met hnm as if by accident at the door, expressed great pleasure at scein" him, and insisted on showing him the heauties of his paIc and gardens. During the drive he loaded himwith civilities without ever alluding to the object of his visit to the Minister; but when they parted Bernard was so intoxicated with the honour that he had received from a monarch who on common occasions would hardly look at a roturier. that he returned to Chamilart and complied with all his demands, saying, 'that he would risk the last livre in his purse to serve such a gracious prince.'" Louis XVIII was equally successful in appreciating and disposing of Fouchn.- " After the restoration in 1814, among the titled followers of Napoleon whowerethemostanxiousto obtainemployment at the Court of Louis XVIII., none showed more servility and assuidity to accomplish his-purpose than Fouch6dDuc d'Otranto. He at last had a private interview with the Eing, when he x ressed hisdes reto dedicate his life to his service. Louis replied, ' You have occupied underBonaparte a situation of great trust, which must have given you opportunities of knowing everything that passed, and of gainig an insightintothecharactersof menofpublielife,whichcoulduot easily occur to others. Were I to decide on attaching you to my person, I should previouslyexpect thatyou wouldfrankdy inform me, what where the measures and who were the men thatyou employed in those days to obtain your information. I do not allude to my stay at Verona or at 31ittau, I was thensurrounded by numerous adherents; but at Hartwell, for instance-were you then -well acquainted with what passedunder myroof?' 'Yes, Sir, every daythe motions of your Majesty were made known to me. ' Eh ! what, surrounded as I was by trusted friends; who could have betrayed me ? Who thus abused my confidence ? I insist on your naming him immediately.' ' Sir, you urge me to say what must wound your Majesty's heart.' 'Speak, Sir, king-s are buttoos,nbjecttobedeceived.' 'If yoacommand it, Sir, l must own that I was in correspondence with the Duke d'Aumont.' 'What, De Pienne, who possessedmy entire confidence? I must acknowledge,' added the King, with a malicious smile, ' he was very poor, he had many expenses, and living is very dear in England. Well, then, Mr.Fouch6, it was I that dictated to him those letters which you received every week, and I gave up to him 12,000f. out of the 48,OOOf., which you so regularly remitted to obtain an exact account of all that was passing in my family.' These words terminated the audience, and the Duke retired in confusion." iMIr. Raikes remembers a gross caricature of the King in the act of making a low bow, and presenting his hind front, which,'from his size, gave much the appearance of the hind quarters of a retiring hog. Underneath was written, "- Gros cocruoib gZeve en A9gletere, adcefdpour die-htit Louis, quzi ve vautd pas uqn Yapolen." Yet the gr)os codwc was an acknowledged -wit, and died, according to l!r. Raikes, with awalembourg in his mouth. The last ticne that he ias asked to give the parole ant cotnterign to his guads, in agcorclae parith the custom to give the name of a saint for the one and of a foridfied town for the other, he gave, with. a significant look, "St. Denis" and "Gyvet" (Ja vis). There is a curious story, on page 25 of the first volume, of a prophetical warning he received from an anonymous correspondent, but it extends to too great alength to be conveniently quoted. In thelatter days of Talleyrand, who was dedining under his eyes, M6r. Raikes naturally takes a lively interest. He describes the diplomatist's habits, including even the operations of his dressing-room, which were thus obtained from Lord Sefton "This morning he was ushered into the dressing-room of this celebrated octogenarian, who was under the hands of two vWs de cdamXN while a third, who was training for the mysteries of the toilette. stood looking on with attention to perfect himself in his fature duties. The Rrince was in a loose flannel gown, his long locks (for it is no wig), which are rather scanty, as may be supposed, were twisted and cr.pus with the curling-iron, saturated with powder and pomatum, and then with great care arranged into those snowy ringlets which have been so much known and remarked all over Erope. -His under attire was a flannel pantaloon, looseand undulatig, exceptin thoseparts which were restrained by the bandages of the iron bar which supports the lameleg of thiscelebrated cut dejiatt" A caricature of him in his state of debility, sup- ported by his servants, and entitled La Jeu?. Framce, is unsparingly remembered. Another statement shows that he was capable at times of exhibit- ing some emotion. It was observed that he was greatly affected by the death of the Princess de Vaudemont, with whom he used to pass his evenings; and that he even shed tears for her. "Upon this Alvanley said, that he had likewise onee seen him melted into tears, and theoccasionof it was rather House of Peers, the Mfarquis of Londonderr,i h etb a violent attack on the foreign poliyo h eetWi Administration, made some verpesnlauiostth priV844 cbmaxater of Princ@taiernl wih b mas- dor to a foreign Court, he might have omitted There iag onlf one opoion on this subject in the Houee, and theDukg o Weug tonroseimediatelytoprotectbisveteranfriends finihing speech with many handsome compliments to the Irince on his great talents and the eminent services 'which he had performed o many occasions for the good of Europe.

Hie expressed his gratitudce in the warmest terms, while the team ran do'wn hls cheeks, and then added:-' J'en suis d'autant; plus reconnaissant a 2i le Duc, que cest le seul homme d%tat dans le monde quLi ait jasnais dit du bien de moi.? The confession was rather ludicrous." Here is a specimen of Talleyrand's mots at the expense of two of our defunct celebrities ._ - He said of Lord Holland .-' C'est la bienveillance, mnme, mais la bienveillance Ia plus perturbatrice qu'on &it; jamais vue.' Of Lady Holland he observed:- Elle ests toute asertion, mais quand on demande La preuve, c'est lit son sce. Here is an amusing ilusttion of the hauteur of Mladame la chale Soult- "Iremember thatMademoiaelleBourgouin, the celebrated actress, told me several years ago of a correspondence which. actually took place between her and Madame la ear6chale on a singular subject; they were then livig aS next door neighbours in the sLme street in Paris, an the great lady had a favourite cat, which, for some private reasons, often strayed to the house of the actress, and was missing ats home; complaintswererepeatedlymadeof thesewanderin but still the cat was always to be found in the kitchen ofr actress notwithstanding the prohibition given to harbour him. At length the duchess, who had just received her title from the Emperor, wrote a most isV ant letter tok Mademoisele Bourgouin, malking her responsible for the absence of her favourite, and signing hersef,with great pomp, 'Eug6nie de Dalmatie.' =ademoiselle Bourgouin, whose' epigrammatic wit was almost proverbial, could not let slip. this opportunity of mortifying the pride of her neighbour. She wrote a very appropriate letter mn reply and signed herself ' Iphig&nie en Aulide,' which was one of her favourite' eharacters on the French stage, and the world conIdnot help smiling at the paralleL" Here is a stil more characteristic trait of a literary contemporary .- "Lord Lowther goes away on Saturday for London; Hie is comnisioned to find out the dimensions of the Salle des Menus Plaisirs at Versailles for Croker;, who has read in some book that Mirabemu addressed 6,000 people in it in 1789; and as the critic doubts the pos-. sibility of the room holding such a number, he is verp anxious to be able to contradict it from authority, which t believe I can furni him." 3Er. Raikes does not appear himself to have beea particularly studious of matters which did not concern his friends or their grandfathers. He dlisparages, for example, the exhibition at the Hotel Cluny as useless. Accordingly he describes for usa. portrait of Louis XIV., by Vandyke. He cultivates his French, but, wishing to stock the. park of Fontainbleau, he observes, in 'what he. supposes to be his own language, " the great desideratunr which appeared to me was the absence of gamie." Mr. Raikes is, in fact, open to suf$icientf strictures of various kinds, but his journal is nevertheless a very entertaining, book-, and those who havto read thus much of it will desire to see its continuation.

To supply these training colleges there is a large number of pupil-teachers, educatecl in various national schools throughout the kingdom at the nation's charge. Now, it is a fact that the great majority of these pupil-teachers never go to any training college, but* after receiving a specific training for a specific purpose, they ale lost to the cause for which they have been prepared;and, admitting all that has been said about theihaving earned their money and so forth, there is no doubt that, so far as the nation's money was expended to fit them for the office of schoolmaster, it has been thrown away. Professor Moseley, in his report of last year, states that out. of 820 male pupil teachers who completed their apprentice-. ships in 1S54, only 303 presented themselves at the training schools as candidates for Queen's Scholarships, the remaining 517 having gone no one Imows whither; but every ono* can guess why they refased to become schoolmasters. Now, let us tum our attention to the few that do become: schoolmasters. After two years' hard study in a training college, and after passing two severe examinations-a week. each-they go out to their schools. And what sort of teachers as a body are they? Listen to Irofessor Moseley:- " In the reports which I have annually addressed to yourLordshipsI have sought to record wvith fidelity, as was my duty, the facts connected with the state of elementary education which it has been my province to collect; and, encouraged by the confidence which you have reposed in. your inspectors, I have been accustomed to express freelythe opinions which I have been led to form as to the subjects and methods of elementary instruction. If in the expression of these opinicons censure has predominated, I am. ready to plead guilty to an injustice. The defects I havapointed out, however frequaent, are still the exceptions. I have listened with delight and with instruction to very many lessons delivered by elementary teachers, which weroa admirable rn the adaptation of the subject-matter and ofthe manner to the work with w;hich the elementary teacheris charged. And I am familiar with examplea of faithflness, of industry, of perseverance, and of dedication on the part of the teachers, to which I know not whether a parallel is to be found in any other walk in life." I would call particular attention to the following paragraph -in the same report:- "If, indeed, reference be had chiefly to the power of imparting knowledge, and to the matter of instruction. only in so far as it regards the educational end to bc. accomplished, I believe it not to be inconsistent eitherwith the facts or the probabilities of the case to clim for the class of elementary teachers the character of the best teachers in the country;for they are the only teachers who, as a class, have miade teaching the subject of spedal and systematic study, who have practised it underthe direction of careful instructors, and whose success as* teachers is officially recognized and rewarded."-Minutcs, 1854-55, pp. 299-300. Now, Sir, if education be so important a thing, if it is at this present time the one thing needful for the welfare and even existence of this nation, how about the schoolmasters, who are the very soul of this so necessary thing ? Why,. Sir, I will affirm of them that they are paid salaries scanda& lously low; that, as a body, they are all miserably in debt and cannot help themselves; that their work is so hard and so confining that in a few years they are worU down andt become prematurely old; that there is absolutely no pro spect for them when old age comes but the workhouse; andlethimwhocanprove thecontrarydenythesethings. Wecannot wonder that the great majority of pupil eachers, having tasted the kind of yoke they are to submit tothrough life, and foreseeing how they are tobo remnnerated, should choose to be excused. Nor can I wonder-though some do-that schoolmasters should be a discontented class, and rather given to change. Let us be sure that nothing can be more tree tban what Lord John Russell told us in 1847, that " the Government can never efficiently raise theeducation of the country until it had raised the condition. and prospects of the schoolmaster." "M lany school. masters," he went on to say, " after they have been trained; are soon tired of the drudgery of the school, and leave it foemore profitable employment. Now, this is a great misfor. tune." And I believe it will continue a misfortune attend. ing all schemes of education until- L The schoolmaster is paid such a salary as to keep him. clear from anxiety, and enable him to provide sufficiently for sickness and old age. 2. He is placed in such a position as not to be subject. to the arbitrary and, possibly, tyrannical control of any man. 3. He has opened up to him a career of advancement and promotion to, first, abetter school; then, an office as lecturer in a training college, then, the vice-principalship, and the princisilship, or a sub-inspectorshep or in. spectorship , with s alarlie s atta che d, that wouli d really b e-F rewards; for at present, as every one knows, he has all thelabour and poverty, and others get the pay and the eeat.
