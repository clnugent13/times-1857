Middlesex Sessions, Monday, Feb. 9.
AfrDDLEfSDR sx;IOALS, Afonday, Fcb. 9.
The February general ons of tho peace for the county of iddledex commenced this morning at ClerkenweUl before Mr. Pashley, Q.C, Assistant.Judge, and a bench of
he tot number of prisoners committed for tr was 103, 90 upon charges of felony ana 13 of mL-demeanour.
In his ch- ge to the grand jury, the AsmsTANT JuDJr, alluding to the state of the calendar, said, with the prisoners already in cuntoy, the total nmnber with whom they would have to deal dunng the February session would probably be near upon 220, reckoning upon the committals for the adjourned sessions. With respect to juvenile offenders, of which class there was a great proortion in Middlesex, the natiorn happily WAs bestirring itself to organize reformatory institutions, and he knew no better modoin which abenevo. lentman conlddispensecharityandbenefit socletyatthesame tim than by supportingsuch institntions. They enabled Judges to pass sentences which would be the menas of the great maSority of such offenders escaping from the criminal
ass,an becoming well-conducted and respected membersof socity. Out of 1,658 prisoners tried at these sesions in 1856 no less than 490 were from 16 to 21 years of age, and a great proportion of them had been previously convicted. vf l, l1prisoners actually convicted 469 were known to have been previously convicted, and sentenced either to transportation or to long terms of imprisonment, and many of them had been convicted on more than one occasion. Such facts as these made it manifest that the system of secondry punisliments now in force in this country ws utterly inaequate to the proper repression of crime- and he s glad to see by public announcement that a legisative enactment on the subiect was forthwith to be brought for. ward bythe Home Secretary.
The grand jury then retired.
Mr. SLEiGH applied that a case in which a person named Curling wa s the accused might be taen, as the witnesses for the prosecution, a considerable number, were attending at great inconvenience.
Mr. COOPER, who appeared for the prisoner, sad it would bhevery convenient to all parties if the case were
The A sT.rJuDGx said the best course would be to fix the case for Thursday, as it was not desirable to enter upon a long case on the first day of the session, when a considerable number of undefended cases or those in which prisoners pleaded guilty could be disposed of at a great savng of time and money. Mr. Sleigh's case must therefore stand for Thursday.
Mr. SLxiG1 said,,very well, but he thought it would have been far more convenient if it bad been taken at once, and really he could seo no reason why it should not.
Johni Murpohy, 22, ship carpenter, and George Porter, 20, brass caster, were indicted for having stiolen a cashbox containing one 60l.-note, four 5L-otes, and 28l lOs, In cash, the property and moneys of John Rix, in his dwelling-
The prosecutor is the landlord of the George publichouse, in Nightingale-lane, Wapping, aid it appeared thatthe prisoners and a third person had been in the habit of frequenting that establishment as customers, with a design upon the cashbox, which the ascertained was kept in a drawer in the private bar. n the 9th of January, in the evening, they went in, and, seeing Mrs. Rix there alone, Porter called for drink, and then, having put something -probablya piecof soap-into his mouth, he fell down into the private side of the bar, pretending to be in a fit He threw his legs and arms about in a violent manner and foamed at the mouth, and his companions, apparentlb in a dreadful state of alarm, ran to his assistance. Rix s
having her tea, and patd more attention to the safety of her crockery, which seemed in some danger, than to the man in the fit, and during the confusion one of the other two got to the drawer and abstracted the csahboL Mrs. Xix, noticing the drawer open, at once looked for the cashbox, and, seeing it was gone, she exclaimed that they had stolen it. As s e said this Murphy made for the door, but be was soon captured and charged with having solen the cashbox, but he denied it, and Porter, when charged, said he know nothing of it, and that he had been in a genuine fit. They were given in charge. The third man accompaned trs. Rix toothe station-house in Leinan street saying he would be a witness for her, but when they gotht bte door he ran awayh The cashbox was not carried away Murphy, it would, seem, having droppedl it near to where Porter was lyiDg, then he found that t thgeft wa dis-
Porter, in his defence, said it was not troe, as had been stated, that le had been to the house bfore, and that he realy was subjeet to fits, as he could prove by several of the officers of CoidhathSields Prison, swho had seen him in
One of the officers was ccordingly called, and he sated that the Rrisoner had been in that p)rison, but whether he had had ts or not he eold not ay.
It s rtated that it is quite a common thieg in the y ouse of Correction for prisoners to sham fits to proyire esnpF tion from wheel lxbour and tio sleep in a dormuitory, because
ersons tho areliable to them are on the certificate of the areon,not put upon the treaduili nor confined in separate cells. Some are quite adepts at it.
Murphy said he knew nothing about the robbery The AssssvArx'r4uiGE summed up. The jury found the prisoners GuiUy.
It wvas then proved that they were well-kinownv offenders.
The AS&%TAxT-JuDG sentenced Otem each to four years' penal servitude.

He beggefor men, and suad when he was distharged he etrmined hlive honestly, and went for a soldier, to keep clear of his old compar4ons but he got leave .rons his commanding officer when at Chatham, and he vamne -up to London to see his father. When in the street le met the other prisoner, whom he had known before, and gotdrinking withhim. He hed been keeping company with a girl at Chatham, and he went to the prosecutors shop for the purpose of buying a riDg to make her a present 'of, when he gave way to temptatmon on seeing so many rings on the counter, and they st-ole three. He was very eorry for it, and begged to be leniently dealt with.
The AssIsta.vr-JUDGE sentenced them both to six years' 2penal servitude.
Thomas Leebridge, 24, was indicted for stealing a wratch from the person of Richard Joseph Harris.
He pleaded " Guiltv."
This prisoner was also a ticket-of-leave convict. He vvts sentenced to transportation for a robbery similas to the one nOW charged against him.
The A.SSISTANT-JtDGE said he could not deal with this casso in any wray different from the last, and sentenced the prisoner to six years' penal servitude.

IT is f the traost in4ortat6e,thatyolur isnmeaiate
A.and careful atteutlous be directed to, the Ireent matiageoment of the
coal treleC oTer,jVppgI : Aan we) peat to you. In theinterestsof'ciin1iifi4pcy and justl6e, to demiand from yorDrcosthe fair and ecqual trntmenet ot all thpi coa traders and cusomrson ur line of railway. i
We are largely engaged in the coal tbade from the Dean Forest, Red-
'atock, Bristol. and South Wales mineral districts, and, collectively; *el are carryingon ove1 your TArious lines an extensivre traffic, caspaLble (anderequilbnleand libesatreatment) of aalmtintlndeziniteinceaie at remunerative ratesof carriage.
The rates that w. axe now paying, anud have for some time paid,4 ale fixed, by the tailway Company. at a half-penny per Von per mfile- for power and road, lb. 6d. per ton Lfor termilnals, and one-ighth of a penny per ton per milte for theuse of the Coinpany's trucks ; and they are the same for full trsi loads as for Single trucks.
MWeareiulormed. and believe, that the rates charged to the Ituabon l~aOompanya Are ven-sixteentha of a penny er ton er mifle for power and road. with two-pencepDerton for teminal and on aen per ton for trains-shl;ment at the break of gauge, wit'h I.p
tonxfor theuwoof trncks toconvey the coalfrpmRuabonLtoLondon, a distance of 198 miles. The charge, therefore, for tho use of-tcugih fog the Ruabon Company to London. is at the rate of less than oneisixteenth of a penny pe too per mIle, being lean than one-half of the cbarre mde to us. It is material to observe thaLt thle convey-ance Of CosallRouEbon requires two trucks, and two delays of each track, while for ours one truce suffices; and Yet thes charge for the two trunks and loss of time In over lO per cent, lees than .the chwarg made to us for thelike dletance.
The charge of Iz. 6d, per tou for terminals to us represents, for thle Company, te o oD of handling, shunting, and forming the coal-trains, and didng accommodstlou to uniload the trucks upon one gauge only. But the charge of two-pence per tou for terminals to the Ruabon Coal Company repreente the ocost upon both gauges; and, If you rates amo dixed with reference to their more or lee remunerative character to yourslves the terminal char;te to us should be lower than the same charge to others, wuere a greater amount of labour snd caet is ex. pended.
Thus-Ruabon coal, for 198 miles Par 8s. CxL Per tOn. And fOr 88 milea 4a. 4d. per tou, incinding trucks; while Welsh. Dean Forest. BrIstel, andlEadstok coalpays,for alike distance, Hs RId,and Os,9d. respectively.
We ask foyr no favour: aim ly equal rates per ton iper mile, equal terminals, and equal charges for theuse of the one broad gaugo truck which conveysa our coal to market. amfor the two brucks which are provided out of y7our capital for the Rtuaben Coal COmpD
In additIon to theee unjust and Illegal preferentialarrangements1 we are positively assured that your Diretors have actually entered into an agreemient to change you with a portion of whatever bad debtsemay be made by the Ruabon Coal Cempany ini =srrini; on their loondon trade, having engaged to allow a farther abatement of one-half the tonnage rates upon all coal renresented by the saddhad debts.
Wo reqLuire only a fair field aod no favour, even against the offcias oftheompan, to whom will still remain thes inimrect advantages which the leslinoilicere of arallwa nnotfailtosecure forthemselves.We ask younot to permittbhesuperinten3dents ofyor sxtetlonsto oontinue to be paid agents And servautauf one favoured coal company ; nos, by selling coal, to destroy a class of men who are among your beat cuatomers, nor to receive commissons froa any traders and ithus be temapted to sere two moseters.

A1USTRALIA.
(PR0O2 OUR OWN COMMSWOXDET.)
MELBOURNE, Ocr. 29. | The mail ship of the 5th of August has arrived; that of the 20th, out 70 days, is expected early in November. An ' irregular" mail will be despatched for London early to. morrow morning by the Heather Bell, and the Black Ball Liner Morning Light will sail on the 14th of November. It is hoped that the early January mail will be forwarded by the first of the Red Sea steamers, expected to arrive about the middle of December. The complete course of post wil thenceforward be kept within four months, which about four years ago used to be considered the average length of the Australiau voyage one way. The renewal of the overland route will impart steadiness and certainty to the financial operations of merchants, and the rapidity of mercantile advices wil tend to keep the Australian markets much steadier than they have hitherto been.
Last week was a week of horrors. A fearful tragedy was enacted at the barracks of the 40th Regiment, situate on the south side of the river Yarra, which resulted in the sudden death of two of the offlicers of that regiment, and the dangerous, though happily not mortal, wounding of two others, all living up to the very moment in a state of uninterrupted amity with each other. Ensign Pennefather had been for some time upon the sick list for some trifling malady, which required surgical rather than medical aid. He seems to have considered his ailment-what it was did not transpire -as more serious than it really was, and, although the medical officers of the regiment made very light of it, it preyed upon the poor young man's mind. He was, in short, decidedly hypochondriac; his friends were aware of it, and attempted partly to soothe, partly to joke him out of it. A short time before his death he wrote to a relation in a very dejected tone, and complained that he had blighted his own happiness, and knew he should not have the sympathy of his friends.
On Wednesday last Dr. W'Aulay, the assistant-surgeon of the regiment, who was an invalid, was sitting reading in front of his own quarters Pennefather was in the Doctor's room, for they were very intimate. Suddenly Mr. Pennefather armed himself with a revolver, rushed from the room and proceeded towards the quarters of a brother ensign, named Veith. Veith, suspecting nothing, asked him in a half jocular way what he was going to shoot. He replied rather wildly, "Wait tiU Lucas comes round." At that moment Ensign Lucas's step was heard in the passage, when Mr. Pennefather suddenly discharged one barrel in Mr. Veith's face, and wheeling round discharged another in Ensign Luca's face. Both shots took effect in the mouths of the officers, and, although the wouads were severe, the sufferers are doing well. Pennefather then cried out, "Now, for APAulay," and rushing round the house, to where that officer was sitting, shot him in the mouth. He then looked wildly round as if looking for another victim. The three shots in rapid succession had drawn attention towards the spot, and seeing a sergeant rapidly moving towards him he raised a wild laugh, and discharged a fourth barrel at his own head. He was immediately afterwards secured by the sergeant (WiRiams), who had heard the shots. Mr. Veith, notwithstanding his wound, had followed Pennefather, to prevent further mischief, but felL Dr. M'Aulay never* moved from his chair, and expired in five minutes. Mr. Pennefather lived until night. The ball passed through part of his brain, and though extracted, recovery was, of course, impossible. An inquest was held on the folowing day, when it was clearly proved that Mr. Pennefather was suffering from temporary derangement and the coroner, Dr. Youl, a very able surgeon, pointed out to the jury that in all probability the sudden change of weather from unusually cold to excessive heat on the very day may have aggravated the symptoms under which the poor young man was suffering. Not only was there no quarrel between him and any one of his victims, but they were all on the most friendly terms. With M'Aulay he was on terms of close intimacy, and was acting under his professional advice. They were all generally liked, and the funeral, which took place on Friday, was more generally attended by the inhabitants than any military funeral on record, except that of the late Sir Charles Hotham.
That same evening a desperate attempt to escape was made by some of the prisoners confined on board the hulks at Williarnstown, which ended in the death of two of the prisoners and one constable, and also, fortunately, in the capture of the whole party. The hulk President, or No. 1, is appropriated to the most desperate ruffians, many of them the conditionalUy-pardoned men from Norfolk Island. One of these is known by the name of "Melville," but he is also called Thomas Smith; which of these may be or whether either be his proper name I cannot say, but his notorietyhas beenchiefly acquired underthename of Melville. His accumulated sentences now amount to 32 years, which is, probably, morethan his expectation of life. In the President the prisoners are shut up in strong cels, ironed with 501b. weight, and chained to the solid timber of the ship. Melville had succeeded in persuading the gaolers that he was morally improved. He amused himself, or affected to amuse himself, by translating some part of the Scrip. tures into one of the native languages. The most desperate men are known to be the most prone to " go in for religion' as the readiest mode of " gammoning," and with Melvile it succeeded, for he had been removed to the Success, No. 2, where the discipline is less severe, and the men are put to labour-a great alleviator of suffering in their case.
A gang of prisoners had been on shore at Williamstown from the Success to break atone. At 5 p.m. about 50 of them were ordered into a launch to be towed beck to the ship. More than a usual number were observed to crowd towards the bows of the launch, beyond which lay a small boat, manned by four boatmen (committed by the magiw. trates as refractory seamen), and attached to the launch by a tow-rope. When they got about 200 yards from the shore tho prisoners made a rush towards the boat, the prisoner MelviUe having drawn the launch and tow-boat nearer to each other by hauling upon the tow-rope. At this moment Owen, one of the boatmen, cried for help, and Jackson, ship. keeper of one of the hulks, rushed forwardthroughthe prisoners in the launch. He was sei7ed by Melville and thrown overboard. He swam back to the small boat, and was immediately seized by MelviUe and held under water, but he escaped to give evidence. Owen Owens, one of the seamen, was also thrown overboard ; he too regained the boat, and cluag to her, but his brains were beaten out by one of the prisoners. Several other sailors were thrown into the sea, but were saved. One of the prisoners jumped out of the boat and was drowned. The prisoners beirg masters of the small boat, having cut the tow-rope, plied the oars to seaward, and as they passed the last hulk the prisoner Molville stood up, kissed his hand, and cried out " Adieu Victoria at last." They were then fired at, and one prisoner was killed and another wounded. They were pursued by one of the boats from the hulks, and by the water-police boat, and were overtaken and captured after proceeding about 800 yards. One of the witnesses says he saw Melville strike Owens with the hammer, but this he denies. He says he calculated the chances of escape as nine to one against him, and he gave the odds and lost. He says he is tired of his life, and knows that he must be hanged . but he seems very anxious to relieve himself from the imputation of being guilty of the cowardly act of beating a defenceless man's brains out. There are nine captured, all of whom wYll be tried for the murder of Owens, and they will probably end a lfe worse than death upon the scaffold.
About a week before a police-sergeant, M'Nally, was shot dead while attempting to secure a desperate bushranger named Turner, or Smith, commonly called Gipsy Smitb, Turner had been seen among the stores (shops) at Mount Ararat Diggings, and was traced by M'NaUy and another policeman, named Moore, to a tent. Turuer turned out, and was seized by the men, who are known as courageous follows and accustomed to that sort of work. They got Turner down. Moore at first quieted him by beating his head with the butt-end of a pistol, but while M!Nally was putting the handouffs on him he called out, " I am trapped; shoot the fellows," when shots came from the direction of the tent, kiling M'Nally and wounding Moore.
I mention this case-adding it to the Williamstown rush -to introduce the subject of the seneme of the British Government sending convicts once more to the Australian continent, The view we of Victoria take of this matter is that even if Western Australia on the one side, and Moreton Bay on the other, should desire the cheap labour of convict slaves, we, the 800,000 people of the other colonies, ought not to be caled upon to submit to have any part of this continent polluted by the presence or
a fresh batch of Gipsy Smiths, Rocky Whelans, and Melvilles. England must, sooner or later, learn to submit to kcep herown felon class; her statesmen must strike at the root of the evil by spreading education much more extensively than has ever yet been attempted. Judging from the specimens of Irish who are sent out here, their system of education has been most defective. Obedience to the priesthood seems to be the virtue which is to cover all other defects. The women servants are so ignorant of the minor decencies of hfe in the way of clothing, cleanliness
cookery, and domestic economy, that they seem to me to
be almost unfit for the grand offices, which they are nearly I sure to accept, of wife and mother. It is not surprising that
theproportionof crime hpopulationhas inreasedwithin the last century, and I rppeat that England must notrelynpon a free people like ourselves submitting to be made the reel. pients of the outcasts of British and Irish society. Let it not be forgotten that this colony has once beaten the mother country on the Convlits Pzeveostivn Bill, Ng doubt,
a--
that act was null and void, as being repugnaut to the prerogative, but capable of being made good andl valid by the Royal assetit. It was disallowed by the Crown because it vsaz repugnant to the prerogative. The colony, nothing daunted, passed it ain. A monster meeting was held in November, 185 to support the Legislature. Sir C. Hotham did not think it wise to refuse the Royal assent, and the Queen was not advised to disallow it a second time. If England forces her felons upon us, we shall, I hope, find some constitutional means of obviating the evil. If constitutional means fail, we must end eavour to invent some other means; but I do most earneatly hope that the scheme will not be persisted in. If England had intended to force convicts on any one of these colonies Par-
liament should have withheld representative constitutionsand responsible Ministries. Convicts and constitutions cannot co-exist.

MELBOURNE GOLD CIRCIULAI.
SATURDAY, OCr. 25,1856.
Gold remains at 75s. 6d., with a brisk demand, but rather short supply.
The escorts for the week are full, and as the dry season advances we may expect the quantity to keep uD. The excitement of the elections being over for the presimt, the diggers will have nothing now to distract their attention from their work.
The complaints from'Dunolly continue unabated, no decided step being taken to check the lawless. We nup pose it is the fixed determination of the Government to throw this field overboard altogether, and leave the legislation of it to Judge Lynch, unless the new rush to Chinaman's Flat proves more attractive to the worthless than Danolly. The tormer, at aU events, wil divide the " scum," for where a popalation to the extent of 20,000 is collected it is certain
a large amount of the "unjust' will be found.
The diggers seem to be finding their way back frora the Sydney side, as the numbers on hoard the Sydney steamers testify; the attractions, therefore, of the Rocky River and the reported tens of nuggets have not been such as to in. dues themn to rema;n there.

The Russian Invasion Of India.
THE RUSSIAN INVASION OF INDIA.
TO TEB EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Seeing in the papers there is fear as to what Russia might do against India, v7i Persia, I feel disposed to offer a few practical remarks.
The only chance for a Russian force to advance on Herat must be from the Caspian Sea at Astrabad and by the upper or Attock toad of Khorassan, by Boojnoord and Koochan to hMeshid, say 350 miles. Supplies might be procnred along this line of march in moderate quantities, supposing the villagers to be favourably disposed. Water could be found at easy distances ; but I do not think food for an army of 50,000 could be procured.
In 1853 his Royal Highness Abbas Mirza had with him about 3,000 regular infantry and a few irregular bodies of matchlockmen, 24 guns, and a small body of cavalry. Besides this force, bodies of irregular cavalry Joined the Prince Royal's camp before Ameerabad and Koochan, and remained as long as they could subsist on the standing crops and the plunder they obtained. Before their numbers everything soon disappeared and vanished.
Even, however, for this small force his Royal Highness found some difficulty in providing, until his sud&esses against these two strongholds of Ishorassan brought the pro. vince to his feet.
Vhen the winter set in even his personal staff could hardly find subsistence, and part of the regular infantry was sent home to Azerbijan, a march of 900 niles, through a country covered with deep snow and about 12 degrees (Reaumur) of cold. In the summer the heat is intense, the marches long, from the scarcity of water.
Such is the variable climate an invading army would have to endure. Sickness would soon decimate the ranks, and unless supplies of aU sorts could be carried famine would add to its misfortunes.
Another road might also be taken, for light troops only and by way of dividing a large force, for the sake of more easily procuring supplies. I mean by erossing the mountain pass from Astrabad to Boostam by Sharood, Subzawar, and Nishapoor, joining the other part of the force at Sherefa. bad. But along this line of march water is only to be had at very long distances, and barren salt desert plains have to be crossed, such as from Boostam to Mayomeed, 40 miles, and from Mayomeed to Abbasabad, 46 miles. I accompa. nied the Persian force on these marches, and know what both troops and cattle suffered.
From Meshid to Herat is more of a grain country, but stiU supplies for a large army could no, be depended on. The country, too, is infested, or was in 1853, by bodies of Affghan horsemen, who would hang around an armv on u line of march, cutting off all stragglers. Having been pre. sent with the Persian army in 1852 and 1853, and speaking from what I saw of the immense difficulties his Royal Highness Abbas Mirza met with, I should decidedly say that it would be useless for a large foreign army to cross Persia towards India, unless it carried with it its own sup. plies, and the very having to carry the supplies renders the matter impossible, for if the cattle could be procured their food could not. I call, for such a march, 50,000 a large force, with the numberless mules, horses, camels, oxen, &c., for the transport of baggage, guns, and stores. Where, then, is the danger to British India, even if double the number left the shores of the Caspian ? Would half of their number reach our frontier. And what would be its condition 7
Any other line of advance, such as from lRhiva and Merve and Shahjehan, or by Bokhama, Balk, or Cabul, must be considered as an idle dream to frighten old wemen, as I conclude from the descriptions of those countries given me by the late Sir A Burns and Dr. Gerard, when in our camp before Koochan in 1853, when on their journey from India, and with the dangers of the mountain passes and wild coun. tries fresh in their memories.

TO THE BDITOB OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I was in the Light Cavalry charge at Balaklava. The assertion that Lord Cardigan retired between the advancing squadrons of the 8th Hussars and 4th IAght Dragoons is palpably untrue-and for this reason. His Lordsip was fnfront of the whole brigade leading, and those two regiments, forming the second line, passed the guns almost simultaneously with the first, and, becoming instantly engaged in a hand-to-hand conflict, could not preserve the compact order of their advance for hima to retire betweenthem, had it been possible for him to extricate himself so easily. When the brigade, riding for their lives in the retreat, came hack the different regiments were so commingled that but for their uniforms no one could imagine that they were more than one corps.

Election Intelligence.
ELECTION INTELLGENCE. TTV.T?Tvr%p,n
The Right Hon. W. F. Cowper having been appointed Vice-President of the Board of Education, his seat as a member for the borough of Hettford necessarily became vacant. A new writ was accordingly issued to elect a member to supply the vacancy, and Mr. E. D. Rayment, the Mayor of the borough, appointed yesterday for that pur. poe..
At 11 o'clock the Mayor, accompanied by Mr. Cowper, the late member, and several friends and supporters of that gentleman, attended at the Town-hall, when, after the preiminary business wvas gone through,
The MAYORB asked vether any elector was prepared to propose a candidate po re,nresent the borough in Parlia-
Mr. POLLARD then came forward, and, after a few introductory remarks, proposed the Hon. W. F. Cowper as A fit and proper peron to r)epresent the borough of Hertford in
Mr. C. YOUicc seconded the nomination.
No other can4idate being proposed, the MAYOR called for a show of hands, and then declared Mr. Cowper to be duly
Mr. COWVPEP then presented himself to the electors and was received with great applause. He said,-Mr. Mayor, slectors, and gentlemen,-During my canvass I have had the advantage of ascertaining what is at present occupy. ing your mmnds; and I have found that the income-tax is one of the subjects which most occupies not only your minds, but the mind of the public generally. (Hear, hear.) I am not surprised to find that that tax is felt to be a grievous public burden, and an oppression on thoee who have to pay it. (Cheers.) M1y only surprise is that the people of this country have with so much patienceand fortitude endured in silence for so long a iime this very heavy and burdensome impost. (Cheers.) I tIhnk it wil be one of the brightest pages of our history v hich relates- the fact that this has been so. (Hear, hear.) The people have felt that though the tax did press upon them severely, still, as our country was embarked in a great war with a formidable Power which threatened the liberties of Europe, that they ought all to bear their share in the struggle, and that the way to get the victory-and a speedy victory-was cheerfully to submit to all those burdens which were necessary to canry on a vigorous and successful campaign. Therefore it was that while the war lasted w6 did not hear a murmur fiom any quarter; but every man ehowed a resolute determination to subnn ,, to tlat wbich he believed to bs necessary, and to bxar with patience.- the burdens imposed upon him. But though the jeople patiently endured the income-tax while the reasons which first led to its imposition lasted, it does not follow tha when the necessity for it is removed the same submission and patience should continue another day. (Cheers.) I am only surprised at the apprehensions that have existed on this subject; that people should have imagined that there was any cuestion whatever that the income-tax of 16d. in the pouna was likely to continue for another year. (Sear, hear.) I never heard of anyone in any responsible situation who ever propounded the possibility of such a thing. (Cheers.) I, for one, never contemplated such a course of polcy. (Cheers.) I do think that the clamour which has been raLsed throughout the country on this subject has been most vain, futile, and unnecessary. The Government have been devoting themselves to a strict investigation of the expenjiture of the country. They have already largely reduced the army in all its branches, and ale now preparing to make extensive reductions in the naTy; and Zhen the ChanceUor of the Exchequer places before the country the estimates for the ensuing year, and states the amount of expenditure necessary to be provided for, my friends will see that al their alarm on the subject of the income-tax has been futile. But thouwh there is no question as to whether the income-tax should be continued at its present amount, yet it becomes a matter of grave consideration whether the original tax of 7d. in the pound should be continued until 1860, when, according to the existing law, it is to cease; whether it should be maintained beyond that date, or whether it should altogether cease, and some other form of taxation be substituted for it. (Hear, bear.) It seems to n e that the income-tax has three defects and three merits. The three defects are that it is unequal, inquisitorial, and oppressive. Its three merits are that is the only tax that Irrmgs under contribution every sort of property, and property which would escape taxation under any other formthat itdoes not interfere with freetrade or the developement of trade and manufactures-and that it is most productive and cheaply collected. It is unequal, for though it professes to be based upon the just principle that people are to pay upon the income they receive during the year, stil one feels that the same amount of income may have a very different value to different possessors, according to the E ources from which it is derived. ("Hear, hear,"and cheers.) Seine attempt has been made to remedy this irregularity, and incomes from precarious sources are allowed deductions for management and other outgoings which are not allowed in cases of income derived from land; so that it is estimated that incomes derived from land pay one-third more than incomes derived from business. But no accurate adjustment between permanentandprecarious incomes hasbeen effected; and,notwithstanding the able heads that have been puling over the matter, no one hasyetbeen abletosuggestan arangement by which a difference could satisfactorily be made. The greatest financiers of this country have directed their attention to the mean,s by which the income-tax mi'ht be made perfectly fair and just, but hitherto none of them have been able to propose a plan forremedying its inequalities whichwoulddbear investigation. In the second place the income-tax is inquisitoriaL In this land of liberty we don't like to have a tax-gatherer interfering in our affairs, settling for us whether our business is prosperous or declining, what we are making, or what we ought to be maldng if we did better; nd we doret like to have strangers tumbling over our books, and making notes of the items they find there. (Elear, hear.) Thirdly, the tax is oppressive. If a man finds a particular indirect tax too heavy for him, he may get relief by economizing-by doing without the article which is taxed-but there is no escape from this income-tax. But, looking on the other side of the picture, I find one of the merits of this tax to be that no large bon6 .fide property can escape. There are men rolling in wealth, with enormous sums inthe funds and railway shares, who, under indirect taxation, used to escape contributing to the expenses of the State. But the income-tax catches them, even though they should save nearly all their income, and brings them down to the saime level as their neighbours, thus making them pay their just share of taxation, It does not hinder free trade, and is at the same time the most productive of taxes. it is a tax pecularly fitted for financial crises and times of difnfculty, but I should be happy to see our revenue derived from sources less objectionable. The right hon. gentleman then adverted to the conduct of the late war, and said that, after all the investigation the subject had undergone, the general conclnsion was that, amid much mismanagement and many blunders, no one person had been found so decidedly in the wrong as to be deEerving of very heavy censure. On the principle of justice he opposed church-rates being required from Dissenters. Adverting to the sanitary laws he stated that an improvement had taken place in regard to the number of deaths from preventible causes, the average number having been 114,0v0 uring the last I 0 years, while in 1856 the number of deaths was only 67,000. With regard to education, he greatly desired to see effective aid given to the education of the more studious and intellectual of young men who were willing to pass their evenings, after working hours were over, in the cultivation of their minds and the acquisition of knowledge. Parliament had always been ready to grant the means for carrying on educational purposes, and now another step was about to be taken. It had been thought necessary that there should be a distinct departisent of the Government to regulate and dispense the rants that might be made, and that a responsibleMinister should be appointed to direct the power of the Govermment to the improvement and diffusion of education. It is to this detesmination (said the right hon. gentleman) that I owe my aypearance before you on the present occasion. I assure you I feel most deeply the responsibility cast upon me by placing me in an offiee of so much importance. I feel the inadequacy of my own strengthfor the fulfilment of the great task imposed upon me; butl undertakeitas a dutyIcaunot refuse, and, cheered by your confidence and sympathy, and tbusting in the Divine blessing, I will not hesitate to make tbe attempt to grapple with so large and splendid a charge; ar d I trustrI maybe enabled to achieve something for the gcod of the country and the benefit of mankind. (Loud cheers.)

SOUTHAMPTON.
The nomination of candidates for the vacant seat, caused by the elevation of Sir A. Cockbarn to the Chief Justiceship of the Common Pleas, took place yesterday in the Guildhall, and, as might have been expected from the excitement which has prevailed in the town during the contest, was one continued scene of noise and uproar. The only speaker who had anything like a hearing was Mr. Carden, and this arose from the fact that that gentleman was entirely free from any participation in the strong feelings which prevail against the three real rivals in the struggle. Most of the proceedings were as little understood by those in the hall, so fiercely did the storm rage, as by those who never set foot within its precincts during the day; and the few disjointed remarks that could now and then be heard from the various speakers had relation principally to local matters, which, however
ineresting they may be to residents of the borough, mast
naturally fal to be shared in by those unconnected with it. The business commenced at 10 o'clock before the Mayor and two hailiffs as returnimng officers; and the several candidates and their friends were a pportioned as follows:-Mr.
Andrews and Mr. Carden on the right of the Mayor, aad
lr. Weguehin and Sir Edward Butler on the left. $everal persons in the hall wore the respective colours of their candidate8,-inz, Sir Edward Butler, purple and crimson;
r, drews, blue and orange; and Mr. Wegueln, light
M;r W. J. LB ZRUVRx. J.P., nominated Sir Edward Butler, and Mr. GEORGE HUl;T, J.P., seconded.
Admiral PRESCOTT nominated Mr. T. M. Weguelin, the Governor of the Bank of England, and MI. W. A. SussERs seconded the nominatioa.
Mr. R. Andrews was put in nomination by Mr. T. L. HARMN (proprietor of the Hampshire Indepcndent newspaper), and Mr. Alderman DliSAUTOY.
The fourth candidate, Mr. Carden, was nominated by Messrs. G. BRINTO.N and SCRASB, two members of Mr. Weguelin'e committee, who spoke in favour of that rentleman, avowing that they only nominated Mr. Carden for the
frpose thof gitving him an opportunity of being put fairly The candidates, who were put in nomination according as they had-precedence on the scene of action, then addressed the electors in the same order. Sir E. Butler had not
uttered,many sentences when he remarked that he had no oppositson to Mr. WFeguelis personally, but he was sorry
that he had fa)len into the hands of "such a dirty lot."
This evoked such a storm of disapprobation, mingled with ebeert that anything like a fair hearing was completdi~ at gn end, an4 this con:tinued, wFith little intermission, till the
business was at an end. The only allusion to general mational politics was made by M.r. WVeguelin, Who aTowed bimselfa. supportr of Lord .eglmerston's foreign policy, an advocate of the abolition of church-rates, and a supporter of the ballot. The other gentlemen contented themselves withreferring to their well-known political principles, and the addresses they had issfed, without entering upon any exposition of them on that occasion.
On theshow of hands being called for there was an immense najority in favour of Mr. Andrews, Sir E. Butler and llr. Weguelin abont equal (a slight preponderance in favour of the first.named gentleman), and 12 for Mr. Carden.
The 3Lyox, on the part of the returning o$ficers, declared the election to have fallen upon Mr. A&ndrews, on vhich a poll was demanded in favour of ir. Weguelin and Sir E. Butler, Mr. Carden retiring from the contest.
A vote of thanks to the Mayor and returning officers was proposed by Mr. AMDnExws, seconded by SirE. BUTrLR, and carried by acclamation, and at nearly d o'clock tho proceedngs of one of the noisiest and most stormy election gatherings we have ever witnessed came to an end, cheers for the respective candidates being called for and responded to by their supporters as the vast crowd retired from the haDs.
The polling takes,,lace to-day, and all partie are extremely confident n the result, but, with so many unpledgea voters, all prediction as to the winning man mnst necessarily be at lault. The excitement in the tco en is intense, and the contest iUl be the hardest fought ever reem bered in this boroughu Every hourmthe walls are covered and the windowsfille with fresh pLacards, bearing on the election.
At 5 o'clock in the evening lfr. Andrewsa was announced to address the electors from the balcony of his committeerconis, and at that hour several hundreds of people -were assembled in the street, but a fall of rain commenced just as the speaking was beginning.
The total number of electors on the register is 8,08, of which ISO are double entries, and a large number are always absent in the various mail steamships which ply to and from the port. Itis expected by all parties that not less than 2,6w or 2,700 will poll. There are 13 polin booths provided in different parts of the town. Very few of the shops will, it is antioipated, be open to-day, so great is the excitement, and business will be practically suspended for the day.
AYIESBURY.
Yesterday was the day appointed for the election of a member to sapply the vacancy in the representation of Aylesbury caused by Sir Richard BetheD's acceptance of the Attorney-Generallip. It being known that no opposition would be offered to the return of Sir Richard, very little excitement was caused, but there was a good muster of the friends of the Liberal members. T'he customary formalities having been gone through,
Mr. AcTo. TLNDAL, clerk of the peace and lord of the manor, proposed Sir Richard Bethell as a fit person to represent the borough.
This was seconded by Mr. OLLIFFE, of Dntehlands, supported by Dr. L=x, of Hartwell-park, and Mr. JONES, solicitor of the town.
Several questions were put to the candidate, especially with reference to the extension of the franchise, the incometax, and law reform.
There being no other candidate Sir Richard Bethell was declared duly elected. After briefly returning thanks for the honour he said,-" I be; of you to believe one thing, which I teU you in all sncerity-that no professional honour, no distinction, no kind of reputation, would be to me so dear as that of having been an instrumnent in elevating permanently and to a considerable extent, tbe moral and social condition of the working classes of this country. (Cheers.) Be assured, gentlemen, that is not a feeling proper to myself. I have the pleasure of mixing daily with persons who take rank in the most distinguished stations in this country. I can assure you that there is no feeling more dear to them, more constantly present to their ininds, than a deep anxiety to devise measures that shonld tend to the lasting improvement, to the general social weUbeing of the people of this realmE But remember you have succeeded to an inheritance fraught undoubtedly with great advantage. I mean your position as free citizens of this great country, blessed as we are with constitutional governnient. That is the inheritance you have succeeded to; but rememaber you take it of necessity coupled with the burdens which our forefathers were compeUed to lay upon it in order to secure that measure of civil and religious liberty which you enjoy. Remember, also, that while you have to bear these burdens you are members of a country whose wealth, whose industry, whose position, whose opportunities of rewarding labour and of eluvating those persons who wiU di-tinguish themselves by ability and industry, are greater than is possessed by any ceountry in the world. You cannot expect to have unmixed good. We are now at tbe end of a greit war entered onfor the purpose of securing the independence of Europe. It has been concluded with great glory-I say with great glory, because I want to mark one of the distinguishing features of that war-that it was entirely fouglht out by the voluntary, unpressed, unconstrained exertions of the people of this conntry. In former wars you had a press--rangyou had something like a military conscription. ln the atter war no man went to fight the battles of his country who was not in reality a volunteer. It was gloriously fought-it was a struggle of which you may reasonably be protd of the conclusion. But, unfortanately, now we have to bear the reckoning of the war. To every period of strenuous exertion there must succeed some period of debility and languor. This, to a certain extent, now affects the industry of this country, and therefore you are reasonably anxious to know how those burdens which you bore so cheerfully and nobly are to be diminished, and you naturally look for that purpose to the Parliament of this country. I believe there never wAS a Govermnent more anxious to make retrenchments (cheers), more solicitous of a wise economy, more intently bent on discovering the means of reducing the burdens of the country, than the Sovermment on which now devolves the duty of administering your affairs and of providing for your social welfare. I cannot tell you exact?y, it would be impossible to do so at the present time. the exact mode in which the public burdens will be diminished, but I am confident that there wiU be a very large diminution and a very large retrenchment. But, do me the favour to recollect you are a great people, and you would not desire the greatness of this country to be diminished. It cannot be diminished without affecting the produce of your industry and the machinery for extending your trade. Look at the map of your empire-observe lhat vast possessions ou have in the
aztan in the West. There is no country, no quarter of the globe where you have not colonies equal to kingdoms-where your possessions are not so great that no country on earth can rival you in the number of your subjects or the extent of your territory. And what benefit results from aU this? Why this benefit, that yot possess the market of the world, that your industry hr-a the largest possible scope. But these vast possessions require for their defence a vast establishment-they require a large navy to keep up a comrmunication with them-troops and forces to protect them from invasion-and so long as we wish to maintain our position in the eyes of the world, so long must we maintain large forces bv sea and land and a large expenditure to support them. Is there a man who would for a momentwish the glory and pro eminence of our country to be contracted by an unwise or foolisb economy 7 Look at tho last war-look at the way in which by a course of unwise antecedent retrenchment tlhe savings of years were wholly flung avay, solely because there had not been in past years a disposition to keep up tihe resources of the country to the degree which the grandeur of this country and the extent of its dominions require. I am anxious to impress on your mind that those who have to stuperintend your affairs must look not merely to the events of to-day, but also to the requirements of fature times. Any Government is naturaUv niost anxious to retrench-it is a cheap mode of gaining popularity. But would you let the Government retrench to-day only to place the country in a position in whicli to-morrow you may be exposed to danger and to insult, to be bearded by some other nation in Europe or America? I am sure that is not the spirit of the English people or of the men of Aylesbury. We must look-not to the necessity of the hour, but to that which, taught by past experience, we find the real honour and advantage of our country require at our hands. N2ow, I go to Parliament charged with the most anxious desire to promote all those measures for the social welfare of the people which advance rsin atimeof peace-for I regard as of smaUl moment those outbreaks which will continuulhy occur in our Eastern empire. (Hear, hear.) War, providentislly, is at end in Europe, and the attention of the Government will be devoted to reaping the fruits of peace. There is no man whom I address to-day who feels more anxiously than myself the moral obligationofcdoingeverything to retain and support that industry and exertion which aro the real sinewa of wealth-the basis andsupport of this greatempire. Great improvements are not the work of one day-one generation sows the seed, but after generations probably reap the harvest. So it is with human nature. We must wait a certain time tiUl the necessity for these reforms is universaUy acknowledged. Then, and not till then, will they be of real good to the country. Take, as an instance, Parliamentary reform. How long was it before the late Reform Bit was accepted by the people at large? One gentleman told you it is nearly 70 years since the question was first brought forward in one of the Hfouses of Parliament. What a long struggle before a sense of the necessity of that reform was generally felt and brought to maturity in thiskingdom! I cannot on the p resent occasion say that any particular p lan of that kind will receive the immediate attentmon of Parliament. I san quite confident that there are other
ain more important measures, more imme(liate, and more urgent, that-wlvl be sufficient to engross all its attention. Parliament-the representation of the people, is only a means to an end-that end is good government, and the effect of good government is general prosperity, and a free field for everyman to have an opportunity of labouring and to reap the reward of his labonrs. I wish to see the state of England when every man who is willing to work shall be able to obtain employment and to reccive a fair and proper reward for his work. There are one or two topies to which I may beg your attention for a short time, because they will claim immediate attention. There is one that will unquestionably be discussed-the state of our criminal jurisprudence-I think that will be one of the subjects to which you will find Parliament will give, under the influence of Government, its most inlmediate attention, and that great benefits will result from that discussion. There is anotber subject which will undoubtedly engage the attention of Parliament-I mean the general improvement and enlargement of the education of the people. WVe nmust desire to see them prepared and fitted to take a greater part in political discussions. BOt education and an enlarged amount of information are required to fit them for the exercise of a more enlarged and unchecked political power. I hope and trust that this session will not pass without your being satisfied that this matter has engaged in a great degree the attention of those who represnt you in Patliament. It is idle toexpect
that sa n be done in a short time which it is most de. sirable t6: ave done. All I wish you to understand is that those who represent constituencies like that whsjl4 I have now again the honour to represent are fnW disposed to listen continually to the voices of
oae who send them to Parliament; that they not enlr sgmnpathire with them, not only feel for them,
Imut that they have continually present hotheirmn~ds be Bret duty of deliberating for the welfare of the cqapntry." Sir Ii Bothell then, referring to certain reports
which had been industriously spread assured his con. stituents that the greatest harmony ra6isted between himglef and Iis collegao I?r. LsEard, and whenever a dissolution should happen, whichi might be this year or next, bat I wvonidnot tke place except wthen the Government deemed
itnecenma tifor theO elfare of the coantry, he trusd ey would aginbe returned to fid in promnot'ing good governcent eay the welfare of the people. Sir eichard', in con clusion, moved a vote of thanws to thenreaurning officerda and the proeedings terminated.

He was, however, understood to say that he was for the ballot, an extendson of the suffrage, aboli-' tion of the income.tax, &a. He also said something about the GovwrAment "screw" having been put upon the elector r and ninglcded by a general pledge to light theb

TO THE EDITOR OF THLE TIM,ES.
Sir,-Through your colunmns and other sources it has transpired thax it is the intention of the Lords Commis. sioners of the Admiralty to reduce by one-third the number of workmen employed in the steam-engine factory. A party of four workmen waited on Mr. IL Chambers, MLP.
for Greenwich, to induce him to use his influence with tho Admiralty to set aside altogether their determination, and, failing in that, to endeavour to mitigate that measure as far as possible in favour of the old hands, by requesting the discharge of the men employed in the factory since the commencement of the late war, and also to procureo an ex. tended term of notice, beyond that usually given to persons so discharged the service.
Now, what the engineers complain of is that this partywent upon their mission without the knowledge or the consent of any portion of their body, or without their being* in any way consulted on the subject; they beg to disclaim through your columns any desire to influence any parties connected with this factory in the power intrusted to theni
for casrying out the intentions of the Government. We feel, every confidence that due consideration of the circumstances will be made by the able superintendent and other officers of these works in effecting tho proposed reduction in a manner suited to meet the exigencies of the service,, andthat the undue interference of other parties is uncalled for, and more likely to injure than benefit the workmen.

THE IRISH ENCUMBERED ESTATES' COURT.p
lord BELP'ER presented a petition touching the presenv position of tho Encumbered Estates Court in Ireland, Ad aetting forth the inconveniences to which purchasers of pro p=rty in that court were sabject from the fact of r1o suCeessor having been appointed to the office of conmmissioner vacated by the removal of Baron Richards, and the business under the jurisdiction or mnaagemer.t of that leraxed gentlemuan at the time of his retirenment from the court remaining suspended.
The LORD CHANCELLOR said, 'he would take that opportunity of stating that the Governmcnt bad had their attention called very recently to the state of that Court. The Government had hoped that two commissioners might ie sufficient to transact the business of the Court- but from representations recently made to them they had come to the conclusion that, wvhatever might be done eventually, the:e musat be a successor appointed for the present to the ofli *e vatcated by Baron Richards, in order to wiind up the business of which ho had charge when he retired from the Court.

He knew that on that subject he had the misfortune not to have entiredy on his side bis noble and learned friend on the wool. sack, but in the bill he was now about to introduce he (Lord Brougham) had added to the system of courts of reconcilement a provision, with respect to which he ventured to hope there might be no difference of opinion, as its absolute necessity could rot for one moment be questioned -namely, to prevent, if that were possible, but at all events to mitigate, that most grievous abuse by which, as the law mow stood, any person, not having a farthing in the world to pay in case he was defeated, might bring an action of the most frivolous and vexatious nature against any other person and put him to the expense of 2001. or 300h, and by whicb, in the event of a verdict being re tered for the defendaut, its effect was entirely destroyed and the defendant left utterly remediless. by the plaintiff taking the benefit of the Insolvent Act. Se found from inquijy of the learned Insolvent Commissioners, whom he had seen within the last 24 bours, that the course of the court there, under the act of Parlianment, prevented them taking into consideration the offence of a plaintiff in baving brought a frivolous and vexatious action, and only left them at hberty to consider the opposite case of a frivolous and vexatious defence. (Hear, hear.) His noble und learned friend, the Lord Chief Justice, had he been at tbat moment in the house, would have recollected a case which happened in their early days in the Court of King's Beach. On that occasion a learned counsel, at the very head of bis profession, wbo held a brief for the plaintiff opened wbat was then called a nonsuit, and in doing so made a staten.cnt containingja flagrant attack on the character of the defendant. When the moment arrived for callng his witnesses be turned towards the Court and said he was afrnd he could not carry the case further. Lord Ellenborougb, the judge, took occasien to remark on what he considered the culpable conduct of the learned counsel in lending himself to the plaintiff or his attorney in bringin
an action with so disgraceful an object; but the plaintiffhad his nonsuit nevertheless, for it was not in the power of the Court toprovent that; the defendant's counsel was left with. out the opportunity of urging one word in defence of his client ;the speech of the counselfortheplaintiff containing the most bitter attack that could be imagined against a mercantile man's character went forth throughout the country on the wings of the ress, without the possibility of a remedy, for the report, w *ch was held to be a perfectly fair one of what haa taken place on the trial, came not within the operation of the law of libel. (Hear, hear.) The measure Be wrs about to recommend proceeded on the evil which he hbd briefly described. In addition to the provision for reconcilement, which he took from his billof l1851-rejected by their lordships-he had included a clause with the view of giving a remedy against actions of that description. Great care ought to be taken not to obstruct the access of the poor man to courts of justice, and therefore he gave a discretionary power to judges in the county courts as wel as to those in the superior courts upon hearing the parties-regardbeing had to the nature of the action and also to the circunistances of the plaintiff
tomake an order staying proceedings until security were found for the costs. As the law now stood, a man might be a bankrupt, and not worth a farthin and, if he brought his action for either his own benefit or tfiat of his asizgnees, the practice of the Court now was in no event to cal upon him to find security. (Hear, hear.) In presenting to their lordships a bill for the amendment of the'inw it was highly expedaient that its object should go forth to the profession and the public, in order to its being wel considered by those whom it concerned before he proceeded further with it in their lordships' House. The proposed system of reconcilement, be added, would have a most beneficial effect if carried one step further, in relieving the community from the great grievances which foimed a large part of the sabject matters of deliberation brought before the recent Mercantile law Conference, over which he had the honour to pre. aide. There was no one subject on which that conference. including as it did delegates from the great towns of Eog. land as well as tbose representing the metropolis-was more completely agreed than in complaining of the evils from which mercantile men were now suffermg, arising from the lack of proper tribunals before which their causes might be rpecially tried. The noble lord concluded by moving that his bil be read a first time.
The bill was then read a first time.
OME ARROW-UNION OF THE PRINCIPALITIES
Lord LYND IURST.-I wish to ask my noble friend the Becretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whether he has any Dbjection to lay upon the table of the house a copy of the rolonal ordinance under which the register was granted to the ship Arrow; and I wish further to ask whether he wil lay upon the table of the house' a copy (if he has a copy) tf the register which was actually granted to that ship ? I have another question which I wish also to put to my noble Friend, of which I have given him notice, relating to a vesy different subject, and I am desirous of putting it at once in orderto savehinithe troubleof risinga secondtime. Mynoble friend has no doubt read an artile which appeared in, the Afonitcur a few days ago, and (as X anticipate) has read it withsomedegreeof surprise. Irefer to an articlewhich has certainly created a very strong impression on the conti. nent, and the more so as it appears that certain well-known indiviadals, Prince Stirbey, Bibesco, Soutza, and a young prince connected with the two Imperialfammies of Russia and France, whose name I don't knoe , are either now in Paris or have recently been there, andi have not been altogether idle in that very intriguing city. The article to wYmich I refer sae that the Emnperor from the verY first was de. sirens of procuring the union of the two principalities.; that experience since then has confirmed him in that opiion ; and it further states that he anticipates that the o Powether ow rawho at present seem adverse to these -views wflultintly ot them.y The writer also suggests, thouh sh deees not state at in ve distinct terms, that tie subject of the union of the two principalities will he submitted to the consideration of the assemblies which are to mneet under the Firumani of the Porte. I understand, how-
er,my lords, and I have understoed it al along, that MothTurkey, and, I think, Austria have taken a different
view of the subject, and are very reluctant to allow that question to come before the assemblies to which I have referred. Now, this is aqueion of very great imertcane, because the principalities are the harriers to whichTre leekcs as a defence in future against Austria on theonsie and Russia on the other; and if ther principalities are t

The questio I have to put to his lordshi is this -Whether it is intelndned tbatj the assemblies whic? i are to m~eet in the two principalities 'uxnder the F irman of the Porte should take into consideration and report upon the propriety of uniting the two principalities; or whethoer that question is to be referred exclusivel to the consideration of the represenxtatives of the greaft owers at the future conferences to be held at :Paris? (Hear.)
The Earl of CLARENDON.With respct to the first ,question that has been addressed to mae by my noble and learnedfriend opposite, I have to say that there can he no
objecuion to lay upon the table the colonial ordinance tmder
which registers are issued in China. I don't apprehend, my 5ords, that the register furnished to the Arrow can be produced, because I don't .believe it has been the custom to send home copies of registers given to such vessels. They are given in great numbers, and it would obviously hardly
be worth while to transmit them to this country. I will, however, inquire; and if the formal register granted in the case of the Arrow be forthcoming, it shall be laid upon the table. With respect to the other question put to me by any noble and learned friend, I certainly did read the article
in the Monitceu referred to by him, and (as he supPoses) read it with some surprise. My lords, I will con-
fine myself, on the present occasion, to answerlng the questio of my noble and learned friend. There is no bar put.to the discusmeon of the question of the union, or of an
er question in the Firman which has been lately ismed. That has been a faithfl comlians with the intentions of the. Congress -of Paris. Te declared-ana this was

tat until the Divans iad met, until the people of the principalities had been consulted, unitil the report of the co -nmnissioners had been received, and the Congress had met to consider it, no one of those Powers would do anything to iniSluence opinion in the principalities, or elsewhere, upon that particujar question. I think, therefore, I am only fal-. filling that engagement, so fe.r as lIerThlajesty's Governmuent is concerned, if at the present momenlt I abstain from discUSSing the subject.
The Earl of DERBY.-I wish to recor to the first quo3tion put by my noble and learned friend, relating to th Chinese papers, and to ask whether the noble lord will have any objection to add to those papers some documenks which appear of importance in elucidating the subsequent part of these transactions ? The question of the Arrow and of the reparation required for the seizure of that vessel forms one part of the difficulty in which we are now involved. In the course of the correspondence which has been pablished, however, the main difficulty seems to tin upon a point of a very different character, which I cannot help thinkingthe superintendent at Canton has rather sought for a pretext to introduce as between the two countries. I refer to his demand for the free admission of British sabjects into Canton. It is quite evident that that is made the real subject of contention, and upon that subject the information afforded in the published correspondence is somewhat un satisfactory. Will the noble earl lay upon the table a copy of the communications which passed between Sir J. Bowring and the Chinese Government in 1854 and 1855, and which do not appear in the papers already printed; and also any instructions issued to the superintendent by the Home Government since 1849 connected with the pressing of the English claim to admission into CGnton? There must have been some correspondence on that subject since 1849, and it is important5 forascertaining themerits of the auestion, and for deciding upon whom the responsibility rests, that we should see this correspondence. (IHear, hear.)
The Earl of CLARENDON.-There can be no objection to lay upon the table the papers referred to by the noble lord, and I may say that there is no intention on the part of the Government to withhold the fullest information which can be given upon this subject. If I underseand the noble earl rightly, the papers he waishes to have comprise any instructions issued since 1849 as to the necessity of insisting upon the fulfilment of that portion of the treaty which sthpulates for our entry into Canton, As I said be. fore, there can be no objection to furnish these paprs It is unfair to attribute to Sir J. Bowring the motives which have been attributed to him, for,'no doubt, the present quarrel arose exclusively out of the affair of the Arrow, although that quarrel was at the same time rendered more difficult of settlement by the difficulty of communicating with the Chinese authorities at Canton.
The Earl of DERBY.-I think that at a future period I shall be able to show that obtaining Admision into Canton has for a long time been a prominent object in the mind of Sir J. Bowring, and that he has only waited for a favourable opportunity to effect that object.
Lord LYNDHEJRST said, that the noble earl had on a previous occasion referred to the opinions of the law officers of the Crown,-would he have any objection to lay those opinions on the table of the house?
The Earl of CLARENDON said, that the experience of the noble and learned lord would undoubtedly teil him that it would be unprecedented to lay before their lordships the opinions of the law officers of the Crown.
Lord BROUGHAM was aware that such a course was not usual, but he had once and again, after a refusal to produce such papers, seen them laid on their lordships' table. (A laugh.)
Lord LYNDHURST admitted that it was not the ordinary course, but the noble earl had placed himself out of the ordinary course by referring, in the course of discussion to those opinions, and he hoped, therefore, that he would lay them before their lordships.
Earl GREY conceived that there was a difference between a formal report of the law officers of the Crown on which a colonial ordinance obtained the confirmation of Her Majesty, and an ordinary opinion expressed by them in discharge of their duties, and there might be strong reasons for the production of a report on which a colonial ordinance was confirmed. Ho hoped that the noble earl would include an extract from the despateh of 1847, to which he had referred on a urevious occasion, prohibiting offensive measures aganst the Ohinese without express orders from the Home Government.
The Earl of CLARENDON said that that despateh would be produced, together with two or three other despatches upon which it was founded.
The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH said that their lordships knew substantially what was the opinion of the law officers of the Crown, and he had little curiosity as to the prec.se words in which that opinion was conveyed. He did, however, feel great curiosity to know what was the case laid before them (hear, hear), because, in the letter to the Imperial Commissioner Yeh, Mlr. Coniul Parkes did not state the case truly according to the facts which appeared on the faWe of the paper laid before the House.
The Earl of CLARENDON said that no particular case had been laid before the law officers of the Crown, but thev had been placed in possession of all the information which the Government had upon the subject.
Tho Earl of DERBY asked whether the question of the validity of the colonial ordinance had been laid before them ?
The Earl of CLARENDON said that the question was confined to the case of the Arrow.
The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH sald, that there was one letter about -which he felt considerable curiositv, and from which he hoped the noble lord would lay a longer extract before their lordships, if he did not produce it ir. eteno. It was the letter in which the noble earl, in certain terms, expressed his approval of the conduct of the consul, the superintendent, and the admiral, as in the papers before the House there were only about half-a-dozen lines from that letter. The letter was one in which the noble earl acknowledged the receipt of the despateh of Sir J. Bowring, and he believed was on page 105. He did not expect the noble earl to produce any instructions which he might have sent for future operations, but he thought that he might produce with safety all that part of the letter which referred to past transactions.
The Earl of CLA-RENDON was understood to express his willingness to produce the part of the letter referred to by the noble carL
Lord LYNDHIJUST said, that unless the opinions of the law officers of the Crown were produced those opinions would be of little weight in any future discussion which might take place upon the subject,
DISTURBANCES IN LONGFORD.
The Earl of LEITRThI, after a referenoe to statistics showing the state of crime and the cases of malicious iju-ry and incendiarism which had occurred fora series of
in the county of Longford, moved for the following returns :-A copy of the reports made within the last six months by the police stationed in the county of Longford relative to considerable numbers of men marehing at night in that county ; a copy of a letter addressed by the Earlof Leitrim on the 20th of December, 1856, to Sir Duncan M'Gregor, the Inspector-General of Police in Ireland, requesting information with respect to the marching of men so reported, and the correspondence in reply to that letter, a copy of the recommendation u on which Mr. Evers had been appointed to the commision of the peae in the county of Leitrim, a statement of his qualification, and the correspondence relative to his appointment; and a copy of a letter addressed by the Earl of Leitrim to the Earl of Carlisle, the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, on the 18th of October, 1856, complaining of the conduct of Mr. Dennehy, stipendiary magistrate, and the subsequent correspondence with reference thereto. The noble earl called upon the Government to state, clearly and explicitly, whether they intended to adopt any measures for the protcotion of Hecr Majesty's peaceful subjects in Ireland from the violence and intimidation oï¿½ lawless mobs ?
Earl GRANVILLE said the Government could not consent to grant the first and third of the returns moved for by the noble earl; but to the second and fourth there would bs no objection. As tothe measures to be adopted by the Irish Government, he could only express a hope that they would persevere in their present course of policy, for, according to the unanimous reports of all, nothing could be more satisfactory than the prosperous and orderly state of that country.
After a short conversation, in which the Earl of CLASCARTY, the LORD CHANCELLOR, and Lord MONTRAGLE took part, the second and fourth returns were agreed to.
HOLYHEAD AND IlNGSTOWN.
Viscount DUNGANNON complained of the insufficiency of the stearpacket communication between Holyhead and Kingstown, and asked the Postmiastex-Goneral whetheor any arranemen hadbeen ome o byHer aje-sty's Govern. mon rlatveto ha sujet; ndif o,what the nature ofsuc aragement was, and when itws lkl ob

The Duke of ARGYLL said, he was glad to have an opportunity of explaining o noble lords connected with Ireand the position in w ch this matter stood, so far as the Post-office was concerned. He thought the noble viscount in looking at the subject had attended only to the question of passenger accommodation, to the exclusion of the requirements of the postal service. He (the Duke of Argyll) would remind the House that, however important the-passenger accommodation might be, that was not the question with which he offidally had to deal (hear, hear), and that it was his duty to have regard to the interests of the Lrish public in reference to the transmission of their mails. That, however, was a distinction which had not been kent in view by the noble viscount who had put this questiojn to him. He might remind the noble viscount that regulations which had the effect of accelerating the passenger accommodation might have an effect the very severse as regarded the transmission of the mails. H
noble friend on his right (the Marquis of Clanricarde) was well aware, as a former Postmaster-General, of the necessarily rigorous conditions of the postal service, and the extreme inconvenience suffered by the pubHo whenever those conditionswererelaxedor suspended. He5theDuke of Argyll) could ol say that if the noble marquis could devise any plan by wLouch the passenger accommodation could be improved asod accelerated, without positive injury to the postal service, he should be delighted to adopt it, for it would relieve him from a considerable amount of difficulty And-responsibility. But he did not think it would be easy to separate the two questions. It would be found by any noble lord who would ta1;e the trouble to look into the Parliamentary reports and documents bearing on thi sub.' ject that one of the main justifications for granting lirge sums of pub3ic money had been the acceleration and accommodation of the maills During the session of 1853 a con.-

their reports thoy treated 'a.n s question of Post- office accommodation, having '.eference also, no doubt, but in s secondary degree, to th', question of passenger acommodation. This committoe,, after examminin many persons connected with the st'rampacket service and the railway companies, among wlb.om was Caphin Huish, manager of the L]ondon and No;th-Western Railway, expressed their opinion that the time ocoupted in communicating between London and Dnblin-not London and Kingstown-niight be easily reduced to 11 hours, and, looking at the evidence taken by them, he thought the committee were fully justified in arriving at that conclusion. After the publication of this report negotiations were again entered into between the companies concerned in this matter and the Government. In order, however, to understand the course taken by the latter, it was necessary to describe what the existing postal communication was. There were at present two mails a-day between London and Dublin, one leaving here at 5 in the afternoon and the other at 8.45 in the even'n9 or within four hours of the despatch of the first mail. Tais seemed an unnecessarily short interval between the two mails starting from London, and it was very natural to suppose that any arrangement which would furnish one morning and one night mail would be an improvement both as regarded the postal and passenger communication. Accordingly all the plans hitherto suggested had involved the abandonment of the present 5 o'clock mail, retaining that starting at 8.45 as the evening mail and adding a new morning mail which should reach Dublin the same ni'ht. At present, however, the mail leavin London at 5 o'cfock camed letters ibto Dublin in time for a morning delivery next day, and for the transmission of its letters into the provinces by the morning mails. They could not, therefore, So writhout this mail, or, if they did, they must insist that the 8.45 mail should arrive in such time as to fulfil the same conditions. A similar princiPle *pled to the other mail
which must necessarily reachib1snmsufcienttime for an eveningdelivery, andforthetransmiEsionof its letters nothe provinces by the evenig maiL One of the most active of the Post-office agents in the north of Ireland had witbin the last few days described the inconveniences and the material injury which would result to the postal sevice of Ireland unless these conditions were compled with. It was tolerably evident,therefore, that he (thefDuko of ArtII) ws acting in the interestr of the eople ofIreand of the conmnercial public in both countrses, as well a nteitrsso the, department, when he insisted that anynew plaa proposed should secure a postal communication at least as regular and as good as at present existed. The people of Ireland semed to be under the impression that but for the Post-office some great national boon would be conferred upon the country in regard to communication with Englaid, and that the Post-office authorities, for the sake of some depart. mental convenience, insisted on conditions which were unreasonable and unnecessary. He was anxious, therefore, that it should go forth through the ordinary channels of communication that in insisting upon the conditions to which ho had just referred he was really guarding the interests of the Irish people themselves, without reference by any means exclusively to the interests of the department in London. On this subjecthehadadheredto the regulationslaid dow byhispredece6orinoffice,ViscountCanning,but within the last fortnight he had suggested a modification which he hoped might be of some use as regarded the possibility of adlowing a somewhat longer period for the mght service. He was not sure whether such an arangement could be carried out, for even this would involve considerable postal inconvenience, hut he wrould give the subject his patient attention; and he might assure those noble lords who were interested in the question that he was as anxiouS as any of them to receive proposals wvhich w ould give a better postal sereand improved passenger communication with
The Marquis of CLALNICARDE said that, whatever might be the speed with which postal communication with Ireland was conducted, or whatever might be the steps taken to increase that speed, the passenger traffic was most disgraceful. No doubt that might be attributed in some degree to the want of open competition, owing to arrangements which, on postal considerations, the (3overnment had entered into with certain railway companies; but, tbat being the case, he considered that it was the duty of the Government to propose- and he was sure that the House of Commons would accede to the proposal-that some assistance should be given to better the passenger traffic with Ireland. For his own part, he vieweed with some apprehension, as regarded the safety of passengers, the proposals for increased steam-power, for a Fa ge ship, propelled at the rate of 18 miles an hour, could not be stopped under a mile, and this great danger might be incurredn

Viscount DIUNGANNON was understood to express satisfaction at the answer of the noble duke ; but he hoped, at the same time, that Government would consider the question of passenger traffic.
THE CHARITY COMMISSION.
Earl POWIS wished to ask the Lord Privy Seal what course it was intended to take as to the committal of bills confirming schemes of the Charity Commissioners ? The subject was one of considerable importance, as there was no doubt that within two or three years some cases connected with charities would be brought before Parliament, and the course adopted in future by the Charity Commissioners would be very much guided by that adopted by Parliament. In consequence of the changes which had taken place in modern society, it was necessary to modify the constitution of many chantable institutions, to suit them to the requirements of the House, without deviating any more than was absolutely necessary from the wishes of the founders, and it was necessary that the commissioners employed to devise schemes for caraYing that object into effect should have a clear course of action open before them,
The Earl of IARRO WBY was understood to say that it miht be desirable for the schemes of the commissioners to be id upon the tables of both Houses of Parliament before they were adopted; but that the matter was one which should not be dealt with without mature consideration.

An interruption had taken place in issuing the reports in consequence of a difference between the act of Parliament and .the statutes of the colleges. The matter had been brought before him, »nd he had called upon the president in future to report in each case. RAILWAY ACCIDENTS. Mr. BENTLNCK wished to know whether it was the intention of Her Majesty's Government to introduce during the present session any bill for the more effectual prevention of accidents on railways. Mr. LOWE thought it might be agreoable to the House ?' T »nswenng the question of.the hon. gentleman, he were to state a few figures in regard to railway »ccidents. ?

THE WAR WITH PERSIA, Mr. LAYARD, in the »bsence of the First Lord of the Treasury, rose to ask the President of the Board of Control whether Ferukh Khan, the Persian Ambassador to the ¿mperor of the French, was now negotiating with Lord Cowley under the authonty of the same full powers which he possessed when at Constantinople. Mr. V. SMITH.-Her Majesty's Government have everv reason to believe that Ferukh Khan is furnished with the same powers at Paris tbt he possessed at Constantinople, but the circumstances »re somewhat different. When ?terukh Khan arrived at Constantinople he said that he required further instructions from his Government before he could enter into a final arrangement, and that he must therefore correspond with the Court of Teheran. He left Constantmople for Paris, charged with a special mission there, »nd since his »mval »t Paris I understand he ??? received defunte instructions »t »11 points. Negotiations »re now pending which I trust ,yffl arrive »t «n amicable conclusion. (Hear, hear.) My noble friend stated the other night that, as negotiations are pending, he thought it would be better not to produce the papers on this subject, although the.original intention was to produce them. That obiection stall continues, and I hops that the forbearance of the House will be exercised both with regard to the papers »nd to any discussion of this subject. K, however, any selection from the papers can be made which may show the causes of the war without interfering with the negotiations there will be no objection to their publication. ^^felî'*·1^*? ?2?? avail besett of the first opportumty to move that the papers be laid on the table. ^SL^PST0NE,8aid tbero were two points upon which the House would be glad to h»ve inf ormation, and wluch would not interfere with the negotiations. In the nrst place he hoped the Government would produce a codv of the order under which the recent expedition sailed, and siso »copy of the correspondence between the Court of Directors and the Government as to the mode in which the charge of the war should be borne. (Hear.) ?,*11· T" if ¥ITH (£ *nswer to Sk H· Wn-LOUGHBT) said therewould be no objection to lay upon the table a copy of the treaty of Herat. WESTMINSTER BRIDGE AND THE NEW GOVERNMENT OFFICES. Mr. LOCKE roseto ask » question, of which he had given fifÍTí revive to the condition of Weetminster-bridgS »nd the intentions of the Government thereupon. He would first ???£?3? ???? that wthority had been given for the construction of a new bridge, tbt contractshad been entered into, »nd a Urge sum had been expended. It was then supposed that the new bridge was not safe. The works were stopped, and a committee was appointed to consider tte subject. They made* report, but the works were still stopped. He wished to know whether the bridge was to be proceeded with upon the old or new plan, and whether it was the intention of the Government to proceed uponanv plan without referring it to » committee of that House. Sir B. HALL said he had observed that his hon. friend the member for Lambeth had given notice of his intention to »sk a similar question, »nd he hoped to be able to give a satisfactory »nswer to both of these two questions. His hon. friend (Mr. Locke) had stated very truly that the works of the new Westminster-bridge had been stopped last year for reasons which had been presented to the House in « P»rli»mentary paper containing a report from Messrs. Rendel »nd Simpson, the engineers A select committee was appointed " to inquire into the'pro ceedings which have been taken in relation to the new Westminster-bridge, «nd to consider the present state of that structure, and the course which should be adopted ?? relation thereto." The select committee reported on the 23d of July, but previous to the presentation of their report another committee h*d been sitting upon public offices, and they intimated that it would be desirable that certain improvements should be made upon the ground lyinff between Dowmng-street and Westminster-halL The select com mittee on Westminster-bridge, in their report, referred to that report of the committee on public offices, and came to the following resolution :__ " t0T .committee are of opinion that, subject to the consideration of professional »dvico to be obtained by the Jftrst Commissioner of Works as to the security of the old bridge, the further progress of the works of the new Westmmster-bndge should remain suspended until the Government have had an opportunity of considering «nd deciding ."Ä1"^06 ? 40ffered to Parliament upon this Ust subject, when the. site of the new bridge might be reconsidered in connexion with any general plan of »Iteration and. improvement of the neighbourhood, »s well »s the all-important subject of the headway under the bridge." In consequence of that recommendation the works of the new bridge were still suspended, but he had seen Mr. Page the engineer, that day, who reported that, notwithstanding tìie suspension of the works, they were not endangered, and that the state of the old bridge was precisely the same »s last year. After the session he received the sanction of the Government to draw up a specification for the improvements required in Downing-street, and these specifications contemplated a new War-office and a new Foreign-office in Dowmng-street, and he also received the sanction of the Government for other specifications, and a design showine by a block plan the best mode of concentrating the Govern^ ment offices, on »site bounded by Downing-street, Georgestreet, Richmond-terrace, »nd St. James's Palace, border to. carry out the denre of the Westminster-bridge Committee he inserted the following paragraph in the specifications :- c ..?. " Tí Î design fa *ko I0- represent »ny improvements which the author may^suggest m the principal apnroaches to the New Mace »t Westminster,»swell »s in the communications with the Surrey side of .the river Thames, espociaUy preference to the situation of the new wtrtmiasterbndge, the ultimate position of which must be considered in connexion with this design." ??>???>? ï!J^ÏÎM*MUSlh<ms ;?Lí° ?0???? connexions in .^.^Ä817? eoP^istributed through the Foreignoffice,^ 100 copies sent to Lord Cowley ¿T Paris. ???? should receive these design» next month, heprowwedthat the Easter recess. (Hear, hear.) The House and the public would then h»ve »n opportunity of learning the views of surveyor »ndengmeeHr»s to the best modi of Uyingout thatground, »ni as to the most fitting sito ofthe new W^tminster-bridge He h«d therefore thought it ir?exT pedienttoaskthe Government to come to »ny determin»-
lion at present with regard to the site of the bridge unti the public and the House of Commons had had an opportu nity of considering, the designs of the most eminent engineers of the day. There was another subject of importance to which tho committee on Westminster-bridge hadthus alluded in theirrepbrt :- ; "The changes that have taken place in the bed of the nver »nd in the flow »nd ebbing of the tides of late years onght to havo due consideration: before determining the mode of construction and the headway under tho biidge The witnesses examined before your committee differed somewhat m opinion as to the amount of any-probable future chaDge in these respects." He thought it desbablethat there shou'd be another survey of the river Thames.. There had been no survey of the river since the survey of Mr. Telford in 1826, but he had received » report that evening from Uptam Burstall, pointing out the state of the Thames in 1826, when it was surveyed by Mr. Telford »nd what it was in 1856. When hon. members had had an opportunity of seeing what was the state of the river near the various bridges, especially near Westminster-bridge »nd had examined the various designs to which he h»d re ferred, they would be better able than they were at present to make up their minds as to whether Westminster-bridge should continue where it now stood, or should be removed. If they decided that it should not be removed they would then have to say whether the bridge now being constructed should be proceeded with. Mr. W. WILLIAMS »sked whether the right hon b»ronet intended to recommend that the site of the bridge should be changed, »s his recommendation would no doubt be followed by the committee he proposed to appoint. Sir B. HALL could only repeat his statement that designs would be sent in bythe most' eminent engineers in the kingdom, and he thought it would be most inexpedient »nd improper for him to give »ny opinion in anticipation of what those designs might contain. · ENCUMBERED ESTATES COURT. Mr. MACARTNEY »sked the Attorney-General for Ireland «t what period of time it was communicated to the Chief Commissioner of the Encumbered Estates Court in Ireland that his duties were to cease previous to the 1st of November last ; »nd to the other commissioners tbat they were to undertake and dispose of »U matters hitherto m saia Chief Commissioner's Court from the time of his retirement. n¥rC J-i 5.-i?n?GE?ALD rePUed that on the 8lhof October last the Lord-beutenant communicated to the Lord Chancellor of Ireland the period when Baron Richards wa3tobe relieved from his onerous duties »s Chief Commissioner of the court, and on the 11th of October the Lord Chancellor communicated on the subject with Baron Richards, but he did not know when the information was &Z a$J^ar°A^cha?ls to ? brother commissioners. borne delay had taken place in carrying out the change in the court, as it could not effected out without » àovÏÏ warrant, J ARCTIC EXPEDITIONS. Mr. ROEBUCK »sked the First Lord of the Admiralty whether the Government intended to send out another expedition m search of Sir J. Franklin, and if they had "y such .intentionwhether they would adopt a plan which had been suggested to the Admirdty, of lätting out » srnaU w£uBtea-mer ?n.d ??*? to theGreat ?? River ; aboV whether they intended to despatch it as early as the 1st of ti,Sir C",'^00DsaW the committee who sat last year on the navy had recommended-»nd he entirely concurred in the recomtnend»tion-that expeditions of this kind, not properly belonging to the maritime service of the country, should not be sent out without »n estimate of tho exoense being laid upon the table of the house. The Government could not therefore send out »n expedition without following that recommendation, and they had not yet decided whether an estimate would be presented for the purpose or SUPPLY. b ^ttf clf^ °f the Committee o£ SnPPly was brought up SirH. WILLOUGHBY »sked the Chancellor of the exchequer whether he had »ny objection to lay upon the table »n account of the income and expenditure of the three quarters ending in December of the present financial year instead of waiting until the 31st of March, when the year would be completed, as several financial discussions would probably take place before that date. The CHANCELLORof the EXCHEQUER said that in the statement it would be his dutý to make very shortly he should include not only the expenditure and revenue of the three quArters which had already expired, but alsoan esti mate of the expenditure and revenue of the unexpired por bon of the financial year. He had no objection to produce the account which his hon. friend desired. The report was then received, »nd resolutions were agreed to directing the army »nd navy estimates to be laid before the House. SECONDARY PUNISHMENTS AND TICKETS OF LEAVE. Sir G. GREY. -I rise, in pursuance of the notice I h»ve given, to move for leave to bring in » ?? to amend the ac 16th and 17th of Victoria, chap. 99, entitled "An »ot to substitute in certain cases other punishment in lieu o transportation." I am well »ware of the deep interest fel in this subject throughout the country, and I therefore think it my duty to avail myself of the earliest opportunity of submitting to the House the views entertained by the Government respecting it, »nd of stating the course they think it expedient to »dopt. In considering this question, as I havo done very carefully, during the recess, I have derived great and valuable »ssistance from the inquiries of two committees of last session. One of those committees wa3 appointed by thisHouse to inquire into the operation of the »ct of 1853, »nd was presided over by my right hon friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Thé other was a committee of the House of Lords, and was Ap pointed for the same purpose. Those committees, following rather different lines of inquiry, collected a vast mass of valuable evidence, »nd made recommendations which the Government thought were entitled to very great weight Before I consider the resolutions »nd recommendations of either of these committees, I think it desirable that I should shortly recall to the recollection of the House the nature o the provisions of the »ct which I propose to »mend. The circumstances under which the »ct was passed are too fresh in the recollection of hon. members to render it necessary for me to dwell on them. It will be recollected that trans portation as ? secondary punishment was long in use in thi country. After being resorted to for » great many years » the highest secondary punishment, it had become almos impossible to carry it into effect, owing to the closing o those avenues of transportation which had been open to thi country in New South Wales »nd Van Diemen's Land though in the earlier stages of the formation of thos colonies transportation had been carried on with advantag to both of them. I believe that the great and growing pro sperity of those large colonial communities was in a grea measure owing to the introduction of convicts into them in their earlier stages of existence. Those convicts by supply ing labour laid the foundation of the prosperity of th colonies I have referred to; but, as in course of time th colonies received a very large number of free settlers, « wealth »nd capital increased, and as free labour found its way into and was capable of supplying the market, and o rendering capital available in the cultiv*tion of the land, i became a subject first of doubt and dispute »nd contention in the colonies themselves whether it was desirable tha transportation should be continued; and ultimately ther grew up a settled and decided feeling in New South Wale »nd Van Diemen's Land that it was inexpedient that con victs should be transported to either of those colonies. Unde these ciroumstances the Government came to the wise, and indeed, necessary decision that transportation should bé altogether discontinued, first of all in New South Wale and afterwards in Van Diemen's Land. Such was tho state of things when in 1853 » bill was submitted to Parliamen »dapted to meet the exigencies of the time, and this bill passed into an act,which I now propose to ask permission of the House to »mend. The provisions of the act are shortly these :-After reciting that it had become expedient to sub stitute some other punishment for the transportation o offenders beyond the sea, it abolished sentences of trans portation for les than 14 years, and substituted terms panal servitude. The terms of penal servitude to awarded were not co-extensive with the terms transportation, »s, for instance, instead of transportation for seven years' penal servitude for four years was awarded, and so in proportion ; »nd it was only in the case of transportation for life that Parliament authorized a sentence of penal servitude of like duration to be passed. There was engrafted on that »ct of Parliament, in the course of the discussion, a provision under which what is popularly called tho system of ticket3 of leave has arisen, and the act accoriingly contains » provision rendering it lawful to grant to »ny convict a license revocable at pleasure to be at large within the United Kingdom or Channel Islands daring any period of his sentence. Having shortly stated the main provisions of the »ct of 1853, »nd the circumstances under which it was passed, I will now proceed to describe what I conceive to be the effect of that act, and in doing so I have this advantage, which the committee of the House of Commons which last sat on tho subject did not possessthat I have the experience of some eight or nine mouths more than it had. With respect to the immediate effect of the »ct of 1853-the effect contemplated by Parliament-namely, the material reduction of tho sentences of transportation, the fact is, taking tho three years before 1833, that the average annual number of sentences of transportation in England for the years 1850,1851, »nd 1852 was 2,619. I find that in the three years which have elapsed since 1833 the average annual number of lentences of transportation in England was 298 ; «nd of penal servitude 2,102, making a total of 2,400, being» difference of 249fewersentencesin*st«tedterm since the »ct passed th»n before. With regard to Scotland »nd behuid there are no complete returns for all the years I have mentioned, and I will therefore take the year 185?, »nd compare it with the year 1856. In Scotland in 1852 the sentences of tr*rujport»tIon were 36L »nd in the last year they were only 53. The sentence of penal servitude in 1836 were 171, making a total of 227 3 0 ?? o
wph the sentences of transportation, «bowing a dmmiuliou of 134 sentences as compared with' 1852. With regard to Ireland the returns »te very remarkable, »nd show that a great dimiuution of crime has taken place there. (Hear, hear.) In the year 1850 the number of sentences of transportation in Ireland wasL849 in 1»>1 it teimtínKaiol,m andin 1852, the year before thd ? ofl8o3passed.it had aeoreased to L411; but in the ??»? 1855, which is the last for which I have got a full re'um the number was only 33 (laughter) ; in the previous year » was 39, and I should not be surprised if the return for 185S showed » diminution «s compared with that of 1855 -nre might expectthat a very largenumberof prisoners musthave been sentenced to penal servitude in lieu of transportation so as to make the number approximate to the 1411 «n tences of transportation in the year before tho act Dissedbut I find that in the year 1855 there werf ody' 48o prisoners sentenced to penal servitude, »nd 33 tí transportation, making » total of only 618 »nd » dÆerenceof nearly 900 »s compared with the year 18o2. This is so remarkable a difference that I think ítbt owing to some peculiar improvement in the morality of the people of Ireland, »nd therefore it would h«ve manifestei ftïï " th^*0toA18Sh.',d ????? ben passei Themata feature produced by that »ct in IrelandTthe decrea« S the numW of sentences of tr«nsport»tion.

Ihe number of licenses which have been revoked for misCS5d50Ånp *° ?* em? time is 466; but to this must be added the number of license holders who have been reconvicted and sentenced to terms of imprisonment which exceed themargin of their original sentences, «nd the revocation of: whose licens« could therefore have no effect. The number of these is 583. In addition to these there are 9? who hav& been.reported for misconduct, but who have not yet been convicted otthe crimes with which they are charged. This with the two previous numbers, gives a totalof l,144holdersof tickets of leave who h»ve been convicted of or charge* with crime ; being a proportion of 16 per cent, of thewhole number of licenses which have been granted, As» general rule, I have thought it desirable to «ct with extreme caution m the revocation of licenses in cases whereno charge could be made against the holder before a magistrate, so that he might have an opportunity of defending himself. I have had frequent reports from the police and have in many cases desired them to go to a person suspected of living dishonestly, »nd warn him that the eve of the polioe was upon him, »nd that » persistence in i'lleeal course would lead to the revocation of his ticket of leave. In 41 cases licenses have been revoked without judicial Inquiry; but, »s a rule, I have thought that it would b& putting too much power into the hands of the police if merely upon their report that a man was associating with thieves, the Secretary of State were to cancel his ticket of leave. (Hear, hear.) There may, however, be cises ui which it is so glaringly evident that « man is UvinK dishonestly »nd leading others into crime that his ticket ought to be revoked. On the other hand, while in some casesof slight offences, such as trifling assaults, tickets have not been revoked, yet, as a rule, they have been cancelled in all cases of felony or other offences against the law, whether the conviction was summary or at the sessions or assizes Looking at the principle on which the shorter terms of penal servitude were substituted for the longer periods of transportation, «nd considering that persons sentenced toFinal servitude had no such hopes extended to them as have.represented »s having been held out to those whowere m this country under sentences of transportation at the time of the passing of the act of 1853 it has been determined that, »s » rule, notickets of leave should be granted to such persons, but that they should be required to serve the full period of their sentences. No such licenses have been granted to perSOns sentenced to penal servitude, except under special and exceptional circumstances, »nd these have amounted iu number to but 53. To have habitually granted these licenses tosuch persons would havo been to trifle with the judges»nd to defeate the intention of the l»w. In one instance a gentleman for whom we all have great respect, the Recorder of Birmingham, without the slightest communication with me, but looking at the »ct of Parliament «nd the debates which took place upon it, conceived the opinion that it was the intention of Parliament that two-thirds of the sentence of penal servitude should be remitted as the reward of good, conduct in, prison. I received from some prisoners who had been sentenced by him petitions complaining of the severity of the sentences which had been passed upon them. These I referred, «s usual, to Mr. Hill, from whom, iu reply, I received a letter, stating that he never anticipated that these sentences would be carried out ; that he understood that, if the prisoners behaved well, a large portion of their sentences would be remitted; and. that, if he had acted under an error, he should in these and in a great many other cases feel it his duty to submis recommendations for the mitigation of the sentences. I asked him what mitigation he thought necessary to reduce the sentence to that which', had ho believed it wonld be fully carried out. he should have passed upon the prisoners ? In reply I received from him a letter in which I undersiood him to say th»t ho wishod one-third of each. sentence to be remitted ; but, on my telling him that, ho said that I must have read his letter inaccurately »nd on referring to it I found that that was so, and that what he desired was tho remission of two-thirds of the sentence.

These dangers may no doubt be over-rated ; yet unquestionably they are of great magnitude ; and it is most desirable as far »s possible to provide »gainst them, in the interest both of the country at large and of the criminals themselves. This was very forcibly pointed out by Mr. "S&ron BramweU in his recent address to the graid jury of Essex, in which the learned judge remarked, without expressing any opinion whether tickets of leave are good or bad, tbat the real question is, what beccmeey)f the criminal «iter he is discharged, be it in this country, or be it abroad ? (Hear, hear. ) I have said that I think tho alarm on this subject greatly exaggerated; »nd, in tracing the effects of the act of 1853, I .ought, perhaps, to say why I am of that opinion, iluch has been written in the newspapers about the danger arising from ticket-of-leave men being at large in this country ; and doubtless a great deal of what has been said is not intended to apply exclusively to ihe holders of tickets of leave, bat to persons who have either been in prison or have undergone sentences cf tram portation and returned to this country after their legal discharge. That class no doubt forms a large portion of our criminal population ; it did so before 1853, it has duie so since then, and I am »fraid it must continue to do so. Nobody who looks at the reports of the trials at our sessions and assizes can fail to observe that in a great number of cases the prisoners are not charged for the first time, but have been convicted of repeated and habitual crimes. I obtained a return the other day of the number of tickit-of-leave holders convicted at the assizes held in 24 counties in December last. At those assizes 625 prisoners in all were tried, only 29 of whom, or less than 5 per cent., «re returned as holders of tickets of leave .1 do not say it is not to be regretted that there should be even that number. What I mainbin is that these figures do not justify the great apprehensions felt that all our crime is committed by ticket-of-leave men. But what is the geneial state of crime as disclosed by the returns for the last two years? At the close of the debate on the Address the other night, the right hon. gentleman the member for Manchester (Mr. SI. Gibson) spoke of a frightful mcrease in pauperism and crime, but I did not then deem it necessary to comment on his observations, betau.-e I felt that I should have a fitting opportunity to state the facts of the case on the present occasien. Criminal tables, prepared by Mr. Bedgravo, were laid before Parliament on the first day of the session, containing a very careful comparison and analysis of the crime in this country in the years 1854 and 1S55. T<?rc was *^? stsie °* erinie in 3S56 as compared with 1855, the peried within which such loud complaints had ???? made? It must be remembered, too, that in the year J856 the militia were disbanded, and the regular army considerably reduced ; and, although the majority of the soldiers wh ? served the country abroad were doubtless well-conducted men, yet, when a large body of persons from the ranks of tho army were thrown again into civil life, you could not be altogether surprised if that step were followed by some addition to the statistics of crime, wholly irrespective of the discharge of prisoners upon tickets of leave. Such appears to bave been the general impression judging from what one reads m the newspapers. Now, doubtless there has been a considerable increase in a certain class of crimes, especially in those attended with violence. The returns for 1854 and lfc5o aie m the hands of hon. members, and I trust they will ???11 themselves of the opportunity to examine them. But there was a disturbing cause which it is necessary to take Tto account. In 1854 Ihe passing of the Criminal Justice t°t, ^tended the summary jurisdiction of justices of the peace, and tho consequence was a large increase in the number of summary convictions within the next twelvemonths concurrently with a corresponding decrease in tho cases tried at the assizes and sessions. But in 1855 and 1S56 no such cause was in oDeratton, the Criminal Justice Act being equally in force during botfa of those years. The following tables gave the summary convictions and commitments for trial in 1856, contrasted with those for the previous year :-England and Wales,Ntmler of persons committed on summary convictions in 18E6, 77,667 ; number of persons committed for trial at assizes and sessions in 1856, 19,433 ;-total, 97,100; PJiî^ï of Persons committed on summary convictions in lbo5, 77,041 ; number of persons committed for trial at assizes and sessions in 1855, 25,972 ¡-total, 103,013. Comfarisonof the commitments in 1856 and 1855 :-Snmma-nr 1856 and 1855 :-Summary .. --------------------------------------enumber of summary convictions m 1856 compared with 1855 there was a very remai kable.decrease, amounting to no less than 25 per cent, in the graver class of cases-viz., the commitments for trial at the assizes and sessions. That is a state of things which I think does not justify all the alarm which has prevailed in the country in regard to the progress of crime. Burglary and other violent offences are comprised in this general aggregate, and it is also worthy of note that the crime of robbery, including, as it does, garotting, which is only one of the various modes resorted to for effecting robbery, has slightly decreased in 1S56 as compared with 1855. If the right hon. member for Manchester were present I should call his attention to the fact that the late chief constable of that city recently informed me that within the last three months there has been a remarkable diminution of crime in Manchester. As the general condition of the people of this country is so closely connected with the state of crime, and as the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Gibson) coupled pauperism and crime together, perhaps I may also be permitted to observe that the decrease of crime which I have mentioned is attributable to a cause ?^hich has always a powerful effect on our prison returns. I hold m my hand a copy of the annual return, whioh will be bid on the table by the President of the Poor-Law Board, showing the number of persons receiving parochial relief in England and Wales on the 1st of January, lbo7, as compared with the 1st of January, 1856. This return comprises the 40 counties of England and all the counties of Wales, and I find that in seven counties only is there any increase in pauperism, and in some cases that mcrease is hardly perceptible. In all the other counties there has been a decrease. In Lancashire the diminution is 11 per cent. ; the same in Nottingham ; and there has teen a large decrease in Middlesex and the East and West Hidings of Yorkshire. In fact, in those counties where the population is most dense there has been a decrease in pauperism, and I believe also a large decrease in crime,-at least, of that class of crime which is mostly affected by the «ondition of the people. I may remark that when the general condition of the people is good, when employment is plentiful, and food is cheap, then crimes against property which come under tho head of larceny diminish, but crimes of violence often increase, arising, ^?~th,ey do, from causes quite irrespective of the difficulties under which the poorer classes sometimes labour. Having said so much as to facts, let me now refer to the state of the law. Sentences of transportation for 14 years or upwards may be passed, or, at the discretion of the Court, penal servitude may be substituted in lieu of the higher penalty ; but below periods of 14 years only sentences of penal servitude can be pronounced. Sentences of penal serrande must be carried out at home, or in those colonies of the Crown where the convicts can be employed upon public works, as at Gibraltar and Bermuda, and every prisoner sent to those places must be brought home again to this country either in anticipation of the expiration of his sentence, or when he has fully completed its term; for, even were it legal to do so, there are political reasons against liberating convicts in those colonies. Now, of the 350 persons annually sentenced in Great Britain to transportation, after deducting women, with regard to whom there are now no means of carrying out such a sentence, and also deducting the sick, the old, and those with worn-out constitutions, of whom there are many to be found among the criminal classes, there will probably bo not more than 250 annually ÍZL^I íhe Px"Lesent state of the law could legally be Ä???^?.

The committee of the House of Commons qualified their recommendations by adding, "so far as Her Majesty's dominions may afford safe »nd proper facilities for that purpose." The House of Lords, not less distinctly said, "provided the system can be carried on with advantage to the colony »nd with satisfaction to the colonists." 1 hope, therefore, there will be no misapprehension upon this subject, or any idea that wo «re about to force convicts upon mwilfing colonies. I may here observe that among the many suggestions which have been made from time to time there have been several for the establishment of great penal depuis at virions places, such as Holyhead, Gibraltar, »nd elsewhere, where convicts during the period of their sentences could be usefully employed upon public works ; but those who made such suggestions are not aware of what was the real difficulty in the question. There is no difficulty in disposing of convicts during the steges of their separate imprisonment or their labeur upon publio works ; in fact, lam obliged to refuse the calls of my right hon. friend thePirstLord of the Admiralty for convicts to work at Portland, Portsmouth, Chatham, and Gibraltar, simply because there are not convicts enough undergoing their sentences for the publio works upon which they may be usefully employed. The difficulty consists, not m finding places where they may be beneficially employed, but in finding places whither they may go after the completion of their sentences with some hopes »nd prospects of reformation. (Hear, hear.) It is the duty of the Government to avail itself of all the facilities which exist for that object, and I may venture to say it is the duty of Parliament to assist us in removing »ny obstacles which may stand in our way. The facilities which exist for transportation are these :-Western Australia is the only colony wbich will receive convicts under sentence of transportation. The House must bear in mind tbat I have shown that in future years 250 is the largest number of convicts which wo can calculate upon being able to send abroad, owing to the small number of sentences of transportation which are now pronounced, and it must also bear in mind that those 2Õ0 have all been repeatedly convicted or convicted of serious offences. That is the stock in hand for future supply. What are the facilities for their disposal? The committees to which I havo alluded took much valuable evidence respecting Western Australia. They examined witnesses long resident in the colony, men of property in, «nd, what was more important, who were about to return to, the colony,-those witnesses comprising Captain Fitzgerald, the late governor, Messrs. Brown, Moore, Hnme, &c. The colonists were »nxious to have convicts that they might have the advantage of their bbour. As to tho nature and capabilities of tho colony, the evidence showed that its extent was very large, and that it was, as yet, almost entirely separated from the other Australian colonies. It is described as a vast plain, with only three ports from which convicts could effect their escape,and there would be no difficulty of guarding against escapes from those ports. The climate is good, suitable for agricultural pursuits ; the country presents numerous tracts suitable for corn : there is an excellent breed of horses, which are exported largely to India, being considered superior to other Australian horses ; there is an abundance of fine timber, and the laud is suitable for the growth of the vine which already is cultivated to a largo extent. I believe tho gdemand £for convict labour arose in Western Australia from very considerable grants of land bein» made to private individuals, who thought that land constituted wealth, whereas without labour land is perfectly valueless. Now that convict labour is available these persons are able to turn the land to some account, and there is a general opinion expressed by these witnesses that even under the present system, without adopting the changes suggested by the House of Lords, from 800 to 1,000 convicts ?-year might be received and usefully employed in Western Australiapropablymore if measures were taken inviting capital »nd labour to the colony. In addition to this evidence given before the committee, representations have been made by a deputation of gentlemen connected with tho colony to the Secretary of State that Western Australia possesses peculiar advantages for the reception of convicts, and that both proprietors and residents concur in the desire to have convicts sent. Sir J. PAKINGTON.-Have no representations been senthome theother way? Sir G. GBET.-The only representation the othor way was a petition, which came last year while ihe committee was sitting, which complained not that convicts were «ent out from this country, hut that a certain number recently sent were not selected with as much care as formerly, and that, instead of few crimes being committed, some of serious magnitude had been the result. The Lords' committee advert to that complaint, and recommend a return to the principle of selection, morder to send to Western Australia that class of convicts which will be most useful to the colony. This demand by Western Australia for convict labour is one which in the present state of the law the Government is SSn?1? to ÎSUet· ???? is a colony asking for from 600 to 800 or 1,000 convicts ?-year, and we have not more than 250, comprising that class against which exception was taken in the petition to which I have referred. Under these circumstances the question arose in the course of last year whether, under the sixth section of the act of 1853 persons sentenced to penal servitude could be sent to Western Australia. The terms of the act appear to be very .'Every person who under this act shall be sentenced or ordered to be kept m penal servitude may, during the term of the sentence or order, be confined in any such prison or placo of confinement in any part of the united kingdom, or m any river, port, or harbour of the united kingdom, in which persons under sentence or order of transportation may now by law be c: nfined, or in any other prison in the united kingdom, or m any part of Her Majesty's dominions beyond the seas, or m any port or harbour thereof, as one of Her Majesty s Principal Secretaries of State may from time to time direct ; and such person may during such term te kept to hard labour and otherwise dealt with in all respects as persons sentenced to transportation may now by law be dealt with while so confined." ' The question was referred to the law officers of the Crown and, after carefully considering it, they arrived at the conclusion that it was not competent for the Government to avail themselves of Western Australia as a place where the sentence of penal servitude could be carried into effect. The fact is, such convicts would not be subject to the colonial laws and ordinances, tbeir labour could not be assigned to the governor of the colony, and they could not have a qualified liberty. Transportation would lose all its value, and it would be only sending convicts out to bring them back again before the expiration of their sentences at a great expense, without the slightest benefit to the colony. The Commons' committee, in their seventh resolution, recommended that the sentences of penal servitude should be lengthened to terms identical with the terms of transportasi0' w,h,oh they were substituted. The Lords' committee, in their 12th resolution, recommended that the provisions of the act substituting penal servitude for transbortation should be revised.. They did not specify with what object they should be revised, but I apprehend they, like the House of Commons, thought that the sentences of penal servitude should be lengthened, and made identical with the former sentences of transportation. (Hear, hear.) The House of Commons, state a ground for their recommendation-namely, to give effect to a previous resolution, that every punishment should include a first period of imprisonment with hard labour, and a further period capable of being abridged by the good conduct of the convict himself · and they suggest that the present term of penal servitude should, as a general rule, be inflicted, but that there should be.superadded, over and above the present term, subject to mitigation, the difference between the present period of penal servitude and the former period of transportation for which it was substituted. They further recommend an intermediate period of penal servitude. When sentences of seven years' transportation were passed there was a discretion in the jndge, which now remains in cases of four years penal servitude, to substitute a sentence of imprisonment alone-usually two years' imprisonment, instead of seven years transportation. In recommending the inorease of the sentence of penal servitude to seven years the committee recommend that the discretion of the judge shall be enlarged, and that he shall be able to inflict a period of penal servitude longer than the imprisonment, but shorter than the transportation would have been under the old law. I come now to the proposals which I have to make on the part of the Government, as appearing to them to be the most expedient, after full consideration of the subject. We propose in the bill which Ishall ask leave to introduco to give effect to the 7th resolution of the committee of the House of Commons recommending that sentences of penal servitude shaU be lengthened so as to be made identical with the sentences of transportation for which they were substituted. . We also propose to give effect to the 9th resolution, giving discretion to the judge to pass an intermediate sentence between the ordinary term of imprisonment and the term of seven years' penal servitado. The first-clause of the bill will repeal the provisions of the ^of 1853. by which the shorteVsentencesof penal servitude were substituted for the longer sentences of transportation,;and will render persons who may formerly have &en sentenced to transporte&on lir.ble to bi kept in j*mal servi' fxphunedto the House. This will, I trust, provide » remedy io,r the evil complained of, and will enable us to-avail ourselves of the facilities which still exist, and I trust will hereafter.be enlarged, of removingpersons convicted of serions crimes from this country. (Hear, hear.) The effect ?{ this alteration will be that the sentence of penal serviÍJide need not necessarily be carried out by the removal of ¡ the convict from this country, but if it be thus carried out the sentence will carry with It the same regulations to ! ?^" ïT"?!!??

convicfg »entencect to very Snorí terasoi imprisonmenz As a rule I think-it will not be expedient that prisoners should be sent to the colonies on very short sentences. ;In other cases, when sent there, prisoners onght to.be for a very considerable time subject to the control of a ticket of .;!*ÎVï.d '?.?0 Bot Fejbe this proposal with the intention that it should be carried into effect before »portion of their Sentences shall be passed m penal servitude. A very, large portion of the sentences must be for seven years, and in a very large proportion of. cases these prisoners will not be removed from this country. It is proposed togive that power of selection which the committee of the House of Lords think the essence of the system of transportation to Western Australia, and wbch they recommend the Government to have recourse to.. It would be necessary to consider in connexion with their crime and their sentence circumstances of which the judge could know nothing at the thus-the »ge, the physical strength, and the pursuits of the convicts. 1 ? send convicts to the colonies who would crowd the labourmaiket, and who are unfitted f or labour by physical weakness, «ge, ill-hcaltb, and other circumstances·, would be to stod those who would be a burden to the colonies. Ibis would be a course unwarranted by experience, while a contrary method wou'd remove the objections wbich the colonists of Western Australia enterl*i? ?0 ?" i*!*8 .°.f eriminals from which they have hitherto been furnished. The power of selection will enable the Government to send a sufficient quantity of convicts to Western Australia or other colonies to which it byeht be determined to send them, and to avail themselves of additional facilities for the disposal of convicts without further alteration of the law. An objection may be made to the uncertainty of punishment in the sentence for penal servitude, »nd it may bo said that » convict will not know whether he will find himself in this country or in » distant colony. (Hear.) But that objection has always applied to the sentence of transportation also, so that no convict sentenced to seven years' transportation was really sent out of the country. The judge may havo depicted the horrors of being separated from his family and friends »nd being sent to » distant colony, and the convict often went from the bar expecting that he would be transported to a distant country. Butin three or four years it usually happened that the convict found himseU again in his native village »mong his family and friends. For short sentences, therefore, ft was impossible to carry the sentenoe of transportation intoeffect, »nd there was much uncerteinty whether it would be carried into effect or not. Sir J. PAKINGTON.-These sentences were put an end to on that account. t Sir G. GBET.-It was certainly impossible to carry a large number of the sentences of transportation into effect, either from the phjsical incapacity of the convicts, or from other causes, ai.d the right hon. gentleman cannot put his finger upon a single year in which a large bumber of convicts under sentence of transportetion were notretained permanently in this country. It is also to be remarked that the sentences of penal servitude can be earned into effect whether the convicts serve their sentences at home or »broad, while »n »ctual deportation frem this country is the very essence of » sentence of transportation. The committee recommend that a certain number of pnsonersshould be sent to Bermuda and Gibraltar to serve their sentences of transportation, and they say that it is necessary that the public works should be performed m those colonies by convict labour. With regard to the course pursued the sentence passed upon these convicts amounted to a qualified sentence of deportation. The convicts were sentenced by the judges, »nd then, not by the decision of the Government, ? certain number were sent to Bermuda and Gibraltar, and remained in those colonies to undergo their sentences. A further objection would be the sreat anomaly which would remain if the bffl stooped here ? it were left to the discretion of the Government to remove convicts sentenced to penal servitude, it would be a great ancmary to continue to pass sentencesof transportation above 14 years. At present, these sentences need not be passedat all and the judges may pass sentences of penal servitude for thé same term. It may be urged that there is no reason why we ??*^ if*6?«?"1· «»tence of transportation for 14 years. Why should the judges have a discretion in the one case »nd not m the other .' The judge has no knowledge whether the wltlV11 fce ?"?ed l11*0 «neet or not. A man stands before him, and he has ito safe guide to enable him to. exercise a sound discretion, or to say whether the prisoner is a fit person for the labour of a colony. I propose, therefore, to abolish the sentence of transportation altogether, and to substitute the sentence of penaleervitudefor it. I now come to the fifth resolution of the House of Commons, which recommends that sentences should not be carried into effect where convicts considered themselves enbüed to their partial remission. I have been asked by many persons to extend these remissions to those under sentence of penal servitude. I replied that I would not do so, because I did not want Parliament to.be hampered »nd fettered in the consideration of this question. I thought if I held out anv expectation of a remission of these sentences I should bé told that we were breaking faith with these prisoners. No prisoner under sentence of penal servitude, except in a few special cases, has had any expectations held out to him of a remission of any portion of his punishment, and Parliament lb ?6?01°· -?* ,bbet,7 to deal with these persons as it thinks best. I admit that the resolution of the committee is founded upon the evidence of witnesses of great weight. Some of the judges are also of opinion that it is desirable to |ive a stimubsto hope, and to hold out the prospect of a remission of a portion of the sentence as a reward to eood conduct. In that principle I must say I, in a great degVee, concur. (Hear, hear.) fa may, however, be carried too UÍ m sentences of transportation. ?853 it might be necessary, in consequence of the peculiar circumstances of the tame, and as an experiment, to hold out hopes of a remission of punishment, f think it will still be found desirablethat the principle of this recommendation should be acted upon. No doubt, it is the ¡best way of mamtainmg prison (discipline. Hope is » more influential motive than the fear of punishment, and this principle ought, I think, to be acted upon if the sentences are for lengthened periods. I am also of opinion that persons who are to be sent out of the country ought to undergo some months of separate punishment bifore they leave this country. It has been said that a certain portion of those who may be advantageously sent to Western AusSfeS S be,sent either .with tickets of leave, totake effect shortly after their arrival, or with the expectation of receiving a ticket of leave after their arrival mustern Australia. Captam Henderson has expressed » strong opinion,,?? which,1 concur, that ihe greatest value may bl expected from tho training which the convict receives in England, but he recommends that a part of the strictly penal sentence ought to be passed in the colony to which he is sent. The real difficulty is as to tS who are left at home (Hear, hear.) I propose with £ gard to them that the same principle sLd be adopted. .There are some persons who commit crimes of such atrocity or who are guilty of such gross misconduct in prison, that they come under the denomination of ????????! This class have no claim to any ind5g?nct and ought not to be inflicted ???? a S Theyreafiy almost belong to the class of criminal lunata who have committed some great crime, for which they have been imprisoned for life, not »s a punishment for an offence fcr.whi¿h they are not responsible, but to secure society against a repetition of that offence. With regard to ¡hi other and far more numerous portion of criminals, no T¿£ ewVî ^ 8en,d abroad the tetet, but some lf^1m4^epUt h0?e' «ndve propose to retain the power of remitting a portion of their sentences.

In such cases justice requires that the Secretary of State should make the sentence wliat it would have been if the judge had been-ju full possession of the facts at the time of passing it. Although the regulations upon which remission should depend cannot, therefore, be made the subject of any unbending rule, they may be made the subject of some general rule ; »nd they ought to be communicated to all judges and persons holding judicial situations, in order that when they are passing sentence they may have a full knowledge of the amount of punishment which the prisoner will in any case have to undergo. Then comes the question ot* terms upon wbch the remission ought to be granted, whether conditional or absolute. The committee stated that the ticket-of-leave system had been in operation for too short a. tune to enable them to give an opinion respecting it, and they passed a resolution recognizing the justice of its nrinciple, although they negatived a resolution that it should be acted upon m all criminal cases.

(Hear, hear.) With respect to the gratuity payable to the convicts for some time after their discharge, I have made arrangements to have it paid by a superintendent of police, instead of its being sent by postoffice order to the convict himself. I believe there are no other points to which I need refer. The bill I now ask leave to introduce is ready to be presented to the House, and it embodies the result of the deliberations of the Government on a subject of great difficulty and importance. When the bill is in the hands of hon. members, they will then perceive more clearly the nature of its provisions than they havo probably been able to d ? from my explanation. With respect to the second read. tag, I am anxious to consult the convenience of the House It is desirable that the bill shonld not be long delayed because sentences are being passed overy day, and it would be desirable, if possible, that the bill should become law before the next assizes. I shaU atpresent name this day Iortnight for the second reading ; but if business of more importance should arise I will endeavour to name a day which shall meet the convenience of the House. The right hon. baronet concluded by moving for leave to introduce the bul. _ Sir J. PAKINGTON said that «U would agree that the right hon. baronet had only acted with a due regard to public feeling in bringing this important subjeot before the House; and he tendered his thanks for the able manner in which the right hon. gentleman had explained the view' of the Government. The right hon. gentleman had aUuded to what he caUed the exaggerated alarm of tho country with respect to the ticket-of-leave system, but he (Sir J. Pakington) should rather say that the alarm was misdireotoI than exaggerated. Considering the state of crime which had existed in the country during the last few months, it was but natural that a great feeling of alarm should exist in the public mind; but that alarm should be directed rather against the state of the l»w under which the worst criminals were set at liberty in this country than against that cheok of tickets of leave which applied to another class of offenders. He wished to remind the House that this subject of wide and extensive interest consisted of two pirts -first, the state of the law with respect to secondary punishments, and, secondly, what was scarcely less important, the manner in which that law was to be administered and car. ried out. He wonld advert to a portion of the subject which he thought h»d created as much anxiety in the public mind as the system of tickets of leave-he meant tho impression which existed that, on the part of the Government, a system had obtained of indiscreetly advising the Crown with respect to the exercise of the prerogative of mercy. In calling attention to some instances" of this kind, he begged to say that he had no intention to make a personal charge against the right hon. gentleman, for he was rather alluding to the system and practice long prevailing than to any improper mode of the right hon. gentleman's exercise of his high duties. The right hon. gentleman aUuded to the opinions expressed at the late assizes by some of the judges, and no doubt intended to refer to a charge of Judge Willes at the Warwick assizes. Sir G. GREY observed that the learned judge afterwards explained that those observations were made under a mistake. fbIM.Î'AA wPÎPÎ0?1 saídírat " was desirable, however, that ho should allude to another case brought before thé grand jury at Worcester, in which it appeared that a man sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment for highway robbery (a sentence remarkablefor lenity) was, nevertheless, discharged at the end of nine months, on the recommendation of the right hon. gentleman. Ho had had some correspondence on the subject with the right hon. gentleman, who communicated the recommendations on which he acted, and he was bound to say that if any recommendations could have justified the exercise of the prerogative of mercy in that case those recommendations* would have afforded ajustiBcation. They wererecommendations from the most respectable men, whose benevolence had led them to do an act wP"ch he could not approve. (Hoar, hear ) The impression m the public mind was that these sentences were not to be earned out. Some months ago a very respectable woman, who lived in his neighbourhood, and whose son loa£ír!£lSeníen,0ed ? January, 1855, to four years' penal servitude, caUed upon ¡am (Sir J. Pakington) and placed in his hands several letters which she had received from her son, and which showed that he expected to be released in the approaching.sprmg if some respectable gentleman would give a testimonial in his favour.

There was,however, one part of the pi« of the nghthon. baronet which he regarded with coíãderabio doubt. He meant that portion by which sentences of transportation were to bj «ltogether done away with, and it was to be a matter of uncertainty, when a man was to be sentenced to pen»l servitude, whether ho would remam in England or be sent »broad. He hoped that the right hon. baronet would reconsider this portion of the scheme, because what we of all things wanted to get nd of was uncertainty. .(Hear, hear.) Was transportation, so faras it was maintained, to be regarded as the severest punishment for'the most.gailty, or »s » boon for the weU conducted? Th»t question «eemed to be lef t open by the explanation of the right hon. baronet. He (Sir J. Peking·. ton) hoped that it would be regarded »s the severest punish. ment ; but he inferred from what had fallen from the right hon baronet thatj with theobjectof consulting the feeling? of the colonists, he would for tho future select weU-ooiidncted men to be sent »broad. The right hon. baronet (Sir G. Grey) wasbydly justified in comparing the uncertainty of the old system of transportation with that which had recently prev»iled. The uncertainty which formerly existed was merely that of illness. It arose from the fact that convicts vho were ill or infirm were not sent »broad. It was true th»t some years ago persons sentenced to seven years' transportebou were «ent to the hulks instead of »broad, but that had long been discontinued, »nd it had for many years been understood that a sentence of transportation was always earned into effect. One statement wbioh had been made by the right hon. gentleman (Sir G. Grey) was, in his (Sir J. Pakmgton's) opinion, calculated to misVo^8 country. The right hon. gentleman stated that in 18o5 there were 77,000 summary convictions, »nd 25 000 convictions for offences of » more serious kind, «t assios and sessions : while in 1S56 there were 77,000 summary convictions and only ????? for graver offences. The inference which would be drawn by the public from theso figures w*i that there h»d been a diminution of 6,000 in the number of grave offences. This inference would not, howev.r, be altogether correct, «s he beUeved the »po»rent diminution was in part accounted for by the fact that under the Summary Jurisdictions Act, whichcameinto operation in the autumn of lSo5, m»ny cases which would previously havo beensent to the sessions or assizes were now summarily disposed of by 'he magistrates. In conclusion the right hon. baronet (Sir J. Pakmgton) expressed hi« satisfaction that the »ttention of P»rlument had been thus early called to this subject, and his opinion that all members of that House would be anxious so to shape the bill as best to attain the objects which it had in view. (Hear, hear.) Mr. COLLIER said that the question before the House W33, what were we to do with onr dangerous convicts-with that class of criminals whom our ancestors hanged, and whom we had been m the habit of transporting ? A.nd in settling.thU question we must have regard both to what it was desirable to do in the abstract, and to what we could iu practice, accomplish. The first question which arose was that -which had been put by the right hon. baronet opposite (Sir J. Pakmoton), what were we to do with the very worst class of our criminals, among whom he (Mr. Coffier) included those who ought to have been hanged but had not been, of whom there were several-persons who had been convicted of manslaughter instead of murder, because the juries entertained objections to capital punishment-men who had attempted murder once or twice, but had accidentally failed-men who had been over and over again convicted of robberies with violence »nd desperate offences-men of hardened, irreclaimable characters, living in permanent hostility against society, to which they were as inimical as were dangerous lunatics ? These men must be permanently secluded from society for the whole of their lives. This must bo done upon the principle that the interests of the publio were paramount to those of the criminal, a principle of which it had of late years been rather the fashion to lose sight; and that the protection of society from the violence of the criminal was of more importance than were any considerations of his Uberty, his convenience, or even of the chance if there were a chance, of his reformation. The question was, should our dangerous criminals be secluded at home or abroad? It was said they ought to be transported ; but those who talked of transportation did not always carefuUy distinguish between two senses of the word that were widely different. Transportation iu one of those senses had succeeded ; in the other it had signally failed. A convict, transported to a colony where the free settlers bore a large proportion to the criminal population, and where, while there was a great demand for labour, the free settlers did not object to employ convicts, could be indulged with comparative liberty, »nd might look forward to the ultimate acquisition of property and an honourable status in the settlement. But this species of transportation, which had succeeded admirably, required the presence of conditions which it was impossible for the Home Government to create. The second kind of transportation, which had signaUy failed, was transportation to a purely penal settlement like Norfolk Island. We had no right to turn our worst criminals, the enemies of all society, loose upon a colony inhabited by free settlers. Our only choice, therefore, by between imprisoning them in a purely penal settlement or in this country; and the latter alternativo seemed to be the wiser of the two. If we sent our criminals abroad we had of course to pay aU the expenses of their transport, while, on the other hand, it was impossible at a great distance for the home authorities to maintain a strict supervision ovor thom. But, if they wore retained in this country, such atrocities as those once enacted in Norfolk Island could never occur; and moreover, their labour could be usefully applied to public works, or to the reclamation of waste lands at Dartmoor and other places. It mi»ht be said that imprisonment for life was too severe a sentence ; but it was not necessary that the confinement should be solitary, nor that it should bo a continual incarceration within prison walk. Safe custody was what was needed, and convicts condemned to perpetual seclusion might be easily aUowed certain privileges and indulgences not incompatible with that object. It was well known that permanent seclusion at Dartmoor involved less suffering than the same doom in a purely penal ? Jony. It could not be supposed that, if euch a punishment wero absolutely necessary for our most hardened offenders, the public would refuse to acquiesce in its infliction; but at aU events there was no middle course between it and a return to the system of Norfolk Island. Then a difficulty arose as to how we were to deal with the class which we had been in tho habit of transporting, but whioh we could not confine for life. Mr. Hill, the Eeoorder of Birmingham, proposed that these criminals should be confined until they gave distinct evidence of their reformation. Who was to be satisfied of tho genuineness of the prisoner's reformation .the visiting justice or the gaol chaplain ? That either of these individuals shonld thus practicaUy have the power of determining whether or not a man should be retained in perpetual imprisonment would not bo tolerated by the country for a moment. Nothing, then, remained but the plan proposed by the riglit hon. baronet (Sir G. Grey),-viz., to transport as many criminals as the colonies would receive, and confine the rest during terms of penal servitude long enough to break up their old associations. Sir A. Alison and other witnesses examined before the committee suggested that semi-penal colonies should be founded-that was, that four or five free emigrants to every convict should be sent out in ordor to give employment to our criminals. Such asottlementasthat wonld not only be expensive to the last degree, but being purely artificial and Governmental could never flourish for want of a natural root in the soil. Peoplo asked, in regard to prisoners whom we oould neither transport nor imprison for Ufe, "Must they return to society." No doubt they must-there was no help for it. Even if they were sent to a penal colony they would come back upon us again when tbeir sentences expired- AU that we could do, therefore, was by improved prison discipline to endeavour to reform as many of them as possible, and those who relapsed into crime must, when apprehended, bo tried over again, ani then imprisoned for life It was said tha^, under the schemi of the Home Secretary, the sentence wou'd be uncertain. No doubt it would ; but tho uncertainty resulted not from the enactment but from the very nature of things, and it could not therefore be obviated. WhUo we were only able in the colonies to dispose of a limited number of those who were guilty of offences formerly visited with transportation, wo had no alternativo butto leave it either to the judge in pronouncing sentence, or to the Secretary of State afterwards, to determino which prisoners individuaUy should be transported and which confined at homo. The wiser course would obviously be to lot the decision, in each particular case where a sentence of peDri servitude had been passed, rest with the Socretary of State, who must bo best advised of the wants and feelings of the colonies, and of their powor from time to time to absorb a given number or a given class of convicts. It was satisfactory to find that as a pendant to the present bUl a measure for the reformation of juvenile offenders was to be proposed by the Government. The two measures seemed calculated to effect an important improvement in our criminal law. Sir J. EAMSDEN had been anxious to learn whether the scheme of the Government was regarded by hon. members conversant with this subject as one suited to meet the present emergency, or whother a larger measure was thought to bo demanded by tho necessities of the case. Tho notice on the paper referred only to the 16th and 17th of Victoria, the provisions of which applied solely to penal servitude ; but tho speech of the right hon. baronet had taken, a much wider range, and by opening up the whole question of secondary punishments had givoo rise to a very interesting discussion. Tho Government proposed to base their amendment of the law on two of the most important resolutions of the committee of last session, whioh was a Government committee, presided over by the ChanceUor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and in the proceedings of which tho right hon. baronet the member for Droitwich took a prominent part. The measure embodied the first and seventh resolutions of that committee, or, to speak more correctly, the first »nd second resolutions taken together, recommending a return to'transportation as far as available as a means of punishment, and the seventh resolution, recommending that the sentencesof penal servitude prescribed by the act of 1853, should be extended and lengthened so as to be identical with the terms of transportation for which they were respectively substituted. Now, if they had heard any large or efficacious scheme propounded in the speeches which had been made in that house, or in the multitude of suggestions which had been advanced out of doors, either for reclaiming adult criminals or for giving complete security to society »gainst them when released unreclaimed, they might have been dissatisfied with the Government for proposing, an imperfect measure ; but, whUe the punishment of criminals was comparatively an easy matter, the best mode of dealing with criminals whose term of imprisonment was expired, and who were to be thrown back upon society unrestricted and unreclaimed, was a problem, unhappily, as yet unsolved in EngUnd. That tnuisportation on the whole was most beneficial to this country, as stated by the committee of last year, was now pretty generally admitted, though he could not help thinking that the com· mittee stated its advantages rather too strongly when it said that it had both a deterring and a reformatory effect. The evidence »ppeared rather to shovr fe»t triasportatioa
as a punishment, was not dreaded by ihe criminai «lass (herr,heir);* that,.whileitliadgreatterrors for the «cotcental offender, whowas surrounded by the ties of horns .and kindred, the habitual criminal looked upon it fatter «s a sentence of mere exile than »s a condemnation to a state of penal slavery! (Hear, hear.) So much,, Indeed, ,?^» that, the case that at the jwriod whtn the . condition of our convicts was one of the pgrt^ endurance, and hardship, Sir George Arthur, theGorei.n?rof,yan-Diemen's Land, actuallyproposedto ihe commits "? °118,4' that measures should be taken by .the Government h.' ^«??, bythe publication of tracts urith appropriate skew"*6?'

The Government now proposed to eturn to transportation, as far as tho temper andfehenmtancesof our colonies would admit; but they adopted » principle, which he thought was a sound and wise one-^iz . hat convicts shonld not »gam be forced upon colonie* unwriling-to receive them. (Hear, hear:) That of course muchnarrowedthe field available for transportation;indeed. he Home Socretary had told them that at present no colony ut Western Australia had expressed its willingness to rei erve convicts, and Western Australia could absorb but a maU proportion of those whom we desired to transport.' How far the circumstances of othor colonies and their ??-t mand for labour might widen the field for our convicts bad she gatheredif rom the? speech of the right hon. baronet' et to be ascertained. So far as it went this determinatiÓB f the Government, asan amendment of our pönal system.' must meet with general approval. (Hear, hear.) But the ther question remained as to that Urger section of one riminals who could not be transported, and who, when the ??^? T ,??"*°?????? was over, must be set free in. bngland. The right hon, baronet proposed that the terms f imprisonment should be- lengthened, so as to correpond with the former periods of transportation. That l^f^&r^^A Tïrj' ?"*! improvement; but ha rusted that it would be completei by an ???£ ment that the .fuU sentence should* be carriei out,, and that in. future any relaxation of the punishment should be the exception and not, as under the. present law the rule (Hear, hear.) It was agreed b£ »U authorities that the efficiency of a punishment depended less on its severity than on its certainty (hoar. he«·); and it was a perfect mockery of justice that *· udge should solemnly pronounce a sentence, and that *f riminal should hear it pronounced, when both the one and he other knew well that more was said than was ever inended to be earned mto effect.

UTå, Brougham, in the Lords' reportf 1847, that m the work of reformation time was tho ereatmoral agent, and, although we could not and ought not to resume to say when or how the penitential foelins mizht etin, yet we might be. p&rdoned for distrusting sudden reormations, moreespeciaUy in gaol, where there was no on, portumty or motivo for committing offences, but wherehere were ample opportunity and motivo, of which the ldest and cleverest offender was the first to avail himself f being obsequious to the governor, respectful to ho gaoler, »nd most reverential to the chaplain, in.' he hope of faining that Uberty which, when he had »cquired it, he might employ in the perpetration of ne of those heinous «nd fearful crimes by which we were ccaaonaUy startled »nd »larmed. (Hear, hear.) But while they were extending the terms of imprisonment, they ught to consider whether some further change ou"ht not to e made m the condition »nd treatment of our prisoners. t wa3 obvious that the condition of the criminal in prison n his labour, and m his separation from his feUows, should be such as to make a poor hard-working man, earning the most scanty wages and suffering the severest privaions, but with the enjoyment of Uberty, an object of nvy to him. He should be treated so that when released is recollections of his prison Ufe should bo such as to make a possible return to it an object of dread and almost I-iÎ0ïiî4rnallon:, (SeaJV hear.) ? was highly desirable. with that view, that the Government should resolve to give ffect m every gaol in th« country to the separate system. hat was the only system by which thoy could insure that. f the convict was not improved by tho punishment inflicted. e should not, at any rate, leave the prison a worse man than, when he entered it ; and that association in vice should not onvert the accidental offender into a hardened criminal But ne real point for the Legislature to aim at was not so much. unishment as prevention by reformation; and he confessed hat every day's experience seemed to provo that any adequata rotection to society by the reformation of adult crinunals was aU but hopeless, and that it was only by arresting crime t an early ago, by the instruction and reformation of youthful offenders, that any real and abiding good could ba chieved. That, however, was a very large and interesting uestion, on which he ehould not now presume to enter, ven if the Home Secretary had not announced his intention f soon bringing it undor their notice by another Government measure; and he would only, before sitting down. epeat his opinion that the right hon. baronet, in agaia dopting transportation as » 'means of punishment s far as it might be possible to do so, in. endering tho terms, of imprisonment at home more extenive and more certain, and in improving the system of juvenileiref ornwlories, was proposing as large a measure as they could at present expect, and, in his humble judgment, tha Government for having introduced such a scheme was entiled both to their thanks and their support. (Hear, hear.) Mr. ADDEELEY could not aUow the present opportunity o pass of tendering to the right hon. baronet (Sir G. Grey) his personal thanks for having so early in the session brought orward this important subject; »nd he was happy to sayhat, so faras he understood the right hon. baronet, there was not one sentence of his speech in which he did not ordiaUy concur, and which he would not be prepared mosS ordiaUy to support. If he felt any dissatisfaction it was rather that the measure did not go far enough than with he provisions of the measure itself. (Hoar.) With. egard to tickets of leave, he hoped the doubt that still weighed on the right hon. baronet's mind as to the policy of bolishing them would be removed, and that we should ere ong get quit of that which was a most useless as weU as a most misunderstood provision. (Hear.) The right hon. baronet had brought before them the pros r.ud cons of this question, and siid it was a most difficult ono to decide upon ; but he thought there could be Uttle doubt that the good which flowed from tho system was smaU compared with. ts disadvantages, one of the most prominent of which was the barrier it placed in the way of the convicts obtaining employment. (Hear, hear.) This provision had become a bugbear in the eyes of tho country. So much had been said · about it, and so much terror was asso ? ciated with it, that even were there no other objections his would be enough to render its abolition necessary. Hear, hear.) There was another point about which the ight hon. baronet seemed to have some hositatios, and that was the resolution of tho Conunons' committee of last year. which recommended that a part of every sentence should ba fixed, and that another p»rt should be elastic «cording to le_ conduct of the prisoner. The principle which the committee recommended wa3 that in a sentença for seven years, for example, four years should ba fixed and certain, and that the three years might ba diminished according to the industry and good conduct of ho prisoner. The right hon. gentleman seemed to thinkjt was impossible to make a portion of the sentence fixed and certain, as that would Umit the prerogative of Her Majesty ; but the recommendation was not meant to operate on the ground on whioh the Boyal prerogative was exercised. The diminution of the punishment was intended to rest on tha prisoner's own conduct, but the exercise of tho prerogative depended, generally speaking, on facts made known to tha Home Secretary through the judge subsequently to tho rial, so that the Queen's prerogative would not in any way be interfered with by malting a portion of tho sentence fixed. (Hear, hear.) With these two exceptions, ho gava his unquaUfied approbation of the measure proposed by the right hon. gentleman. As to the transportation part of the cheme, ho took something Uko a paternal interest in that matter, for a proposition having the same object in view, hough not in every respect identical, was proposed by him, nsuccessfully, in the committee of last year. He hoped hat from the day this bül was passed they would bid fareweU to the penal sentence of transportation. (Hoar. ear.) The great cause of uncertainty in regard o transportation was the impossibUity of carryng eut tho sentence, and it must always bo uncertain. o long as we were at the wffl of tho colonies in that matter. t was »lso uncertain in its effects upon the criminal, for ransportation was always most severe to the b=st men; its everity was. felt in the inverse ratio of the criminaUty of he man. His understanding of the new arrangement was hat when a prisoner had a sentence of penal servitude iassed on him a certain period of imprisonment and severe abour would havo tobe undergone, and that when that period wa3 over he wonld be removed to another ountry; or, if not, that ho would ba on ticket of eave or regularly discharged when tho period of servitude was concluded. That was aninteUigible sentence ; but what hopes had the right hon. baronet of being able to carry out he provision ? When ho expressed his hopo that there would be available means of fransportine large numbers of onvicts he (Mr. Adderloy) wished that ho Shad told them where. (Ho»r, hear.) Ho was afraid that for somo time to ome Western AustraUa would be the only place to which we could transport our convictsi The groat difficulty was to find out the means of carrying out tho deportation part of he penal sentence and that difficulty was to bo attributed to he conduct of the Minister who made the first-attempt o force that deportation on tho colonies. (Hear.) The ttempt was made seven or eight years ago to force convicts n an unwilling colony. It was resisted. Other colonies ook up tho question, »nd now it was a matter of pride and eeUng with them not to receive our oonvicts. He hoped. owever, it would go forth th»t the right hon. gentleman ad no wish to force our criminal population on any olony, though he confessed it would have been matter f greater satisfaction to him if the right hon. entleman h»d stated more explicitly in what quarter is hopes »nd expectations of their being received lay. He was convinced that if thoy offered fair reciprocity to the olonists, andasked them, as fellowfsubjects, to enter into» »rrjngementswhich were mutually advantageous to tha mother country and the «olonies, opportunities would ba ound, when new colonies were established, of «nployinc » arge number of convicts in the formation of roads and H*rbours, and upon other publio works, (Hear, hear.) He wivhed to press upon the attention, of the House-th« fact h»t this country was more backward, than, perhaps, any . ether nation on- the continent in using the privita «sutane« of benevolent wcUriduabs with the view ???«?< .
Ing difficulties of this nature. The advantages that hail »ttended the efforts of the Discharged Prisoners' Aid Society »t Birmingham, which had now been in existence tor nearly 12 months, satisfied him that much might be accomplished by priváte benevolence in the reclamation of convicts. (Hear, hear.) That society was chiefly formed fcy the chaplain and officers of the gaol, who constituted» sort of register-office, by me»ns of which manufacturers, who were willing to do so, were enabled to take into their employment convicts who were discharged from prison. The great difficulty such convicts encountered in obtaining employment arose from their being without character, but this difficulty was met by the society, »nd one of the richest men in the neighbourhood of Birmingham, who had taken some of these discharged SS,atnhlB/»r0<lsÎhI,Id',hidvn,01 found his confidence mnplacea. He (Mr. Adderley) beUeved that if benevolent societies with similar objects were established in this country they would be the means-as had been the case in Juanee and Prussia-of affording employment to numbers ^J^I^i^T·^»^0?18· ?? hoped the right hon. Jart. (Sir G. Grey) intended to foUow up this böl by a further extensión of secondary punishments, and that penal servitude would not be established as the only punishment Lrl* description. He (Mr. Adderley) trusted that no »bsurd sentimentality would be aUowed to prevent the much »ore extensive adoption of corporal punishment (hear, .near), for there was a large class of criminals who were affected by no punishment which did not inTOlye ?»?. That class was now allowed to nass pracUcalry without punishment, »nd the consequence was »bat they were constantly committing offences which led to their recommittal to prison. He thought the »bsndonment of desr»ding punishments h»d been carried too far. He conceived that » wretch named Harrison, who had been recently convicted, might very properly have been subjected to the most degrading punishment (hear, hear), and that even had he been pilloried he would only have had his deserts.. He thought also that many crimes which were now visited with secondary punishment ought to be made capital. In his opinion, robbery attended with such violence as to endanger the life of the person attacked ought to be treated as a capital offence (hear, hear), and the orime of garotting should be placed within the same category. Be concurred also in the suggestion of the hon. and learned member for Plymouth that incorrigible criminals ought to be punished by permanent exclusion from society. (Hear hear.) _Mr. LABOTJCHERE said the measure proposed by his right hon. friend had met with so favourable a reception, and so general a desire had been evinced that the principal discussion should take place upon the second reading, that he should not feel it necessary to trespass at any length upon the attention of the House. He must, however, be aUowed to express his satisfaction that no hon. gentleman who had addressed the House had been disposed to treat the interests of the country as distinct from those of our colonies, but that, on the contrary, the question had been dealt with in a large an d comprehensive manner, ?? »fleeting the welfare of tho whole British empire. Hon. gentlemen had evinced a most gratifying desire not to consult merely the convenience of this country with regard to the disposal of its convict population, but to consider, as they were bound to do, the past history and the present Interests and feelings of the colonists. (Hear, hear.) During the recess he had received «counts from some of the colonies of the alarm which had been excited by expressions which had fallen from some hon. members during the debate on this subject last year, and the House was fully »ware of the excitement and panic which had been occasioned in this country by the general prevalence of crimes attended with violence. He had felt perfectly satisfied that when Pariiament met the colonists would be convinced, from the opinions expressed by ihe leading men of aU parties, that there was no disposition to treat them with any injustice. The question of transportation must undoubtedly be considered as it affected both this country and its colonial empire. He thought it could not be disputed that it was a great advantage to this country in adopting a plan of secondary punishments to be enabled io apply the system of transportation to certain classes of convicts. Great difference of opinion existed among persons who had carefully considered the subjeot as to how far transportation was or was not a deterring punishment. His opinion was that it operated with great InequaUty in that respect, for while there were some criminais who undoubtedly felt banishment from their native country as a most severe, punishment there was, he beUeved, a laree and increasing class of criminals to whom transportation did not possess such terrors. It was somewhat _ curious to mark the contradictory evidence which had been given upon this point before the committees of the two Houses of Pariiament. Some persons of the highest authority, mcluding judges of the land, nad expressed their opinion that transportation was to á very great extent a deterring punishment ; but other gentlemen, mcluding chaplains »nd inspectors of prisons, and persons who were weU acquainted with the habits and feelings of criminals, considered that transportation, viewed merely as a deterring punishment, was fast losing its terrors. If non. gentlemen referred to the report of the committee which investigated this subject In 1832, they would find even there an intimation th»t transportation was beginning *o lose its terrors as »n instrument of deterring men from crime, and that some other means of accompHshine that object must be adopted. The committee subsequently appointed at the instance of Sir W. Molesworth expressed the same opinion much more strongly. When thev remembered that within the last 20 years half a ???? of persons had proceeded to Australia as voluntary emigrants he did not think it probable that there could exist among the olass from which those emigrants were drawn the same fear of transportation which existed when It was notorious that it was scarcely possible, by persuasion or by bribes, to induce any portion of the agricultural population to emigrate to a land which jras supposed to be barren and nninviting. Although, however, he thought it doubtful whether transportation was at present, to »ny great extent, a deterring Sunishment to the majority of persons who were Kely to become criminals, he beUeved that, as a means of dispasing of Urge classes of the criminal populaîl°,n' a,?' affording them opportunities of reformation, transportation was, as a secondary punishment, most valuable, and ought to be adopted so far as was consistent with the policy of justice and kindness which it was their interest and duty to pursue towards the colonies. His right hon. friend had stated that the Government, having considered this subject most attentively during the recess, had come to the conclusion that they could not at the present moment recommend that convicts should be transported to any part of the British dominions, except the colony of W estern AustraUa. During the recess a great deal of discussion had taken place in the pubUc newspapers on this subject, and they approached its disonssion with far more information than they had previously possessed. He thought the free expression of opinion by men of great expérience and knowledge had tended very materially to «nhghten the pubUc mind as to the feasibility of transporting convicts to some places which, at first sight, might have appeared weU adapted for penal settlements, but which had been shown to be highly objectionable for such a purpose. When he said that Western Australia was at present the only colony open to the reception of convicts he did not mean to say that opportunities might not occur of e3ta· Wishing convict stations in other parts of the world. lie should not feel justified, however, m holding out a hope that any other colony would bo immediately available for the purpose. Vancouvers Island, the Gulf of Carpentaria, and the Falkland Isles had been suggested by different persons, but to each of these he foresaw great objections. Vi ith? regard to the first-named place a glance at the map would show its unfitness. Its close vicinity to California and the United States of America, the fact that there was a large population of Indians within the island itself as well as on the shores of the neighbouring mainland, its distance from this country, and the consequent expense of transporting and maintaining convicts there, aU forbade the Government proposing to found a convict settlement there. A great difficulty with respect to the Gulf of Carpentaria would be the pledge which had been given to the colonies not to send convicts among them without their own consent;-a pledge which must be observed not only in spirit but in the letter, and which bound us therefore not only not to send convicts to the colonies themselves, but also not to send them to any place in the immediate neighbourhood from which they might make their escape into the colonies. Any establishment at the Gulf of Carpentaria must necessarily be a sheep-feeding establishment ; the settlers would thus be spread very widely apart, and there would be every reason, therefore, to fear that tho convicts sent there would readily escape into the neighbouring settlement of Moretón Bay, the furthest extended sheepwalks of which were at present not more than 600 mues castani from the Guli of Carpentaria. Moreover, according to the latest information received at the Colonial-office the cUmate of the Gulf of Carpentaria was very unfavourable to the employment of white labour in the open air. To the Falkland ???, according to the evidence of Captain SulU van, one of the chief witnesses in the Government's favour before the Lords' Committee, there was one fatal objection which was, that whenever the Government should cease to employ the convicts, therewould be very Uttle chance of their services being engaged by private employers, to any great extent at least. He entirely repudiated the doctrine held by some persons, that »U we had to do was to send our convicts to some remote part of the empire no matter where it might be, and trust to chance for thei filtering away into other countries and to our never hearing anything more of them. Such a thing might be possible with a few convicts-and it would not be worth while to found a settlement for a few convicts merely-but if th convicts were numerous the neighbouring countries would not quietly submit to the dangers to which such s policy would expose them. Already the United States of America had passed a very stringent law for the purpose of prevent ing vessels bringing pardoned men from our settlement a Bermuda into their ports, «nd it had been acted upon, iu one or two instances, at New York. The colony of Vic toria, too, had also passed a similar law-a very objec tionable law in this instance he was bound to admit, and only to be justified on the strongest necessity-to preven the ingress of pardoned men from other colonies. The Go vernment, therefore, could not reasonably look to Van couver's Island, the Gulf of Carpentaria, or to the Falkland Jsles for the disposal of our convicts, and there only re mained Western AustraUa which was the single British settlement at present open for their reception. This colony had never been used for this purpose to the extent origin aliy intended, nor indeed tothe extent which was desired by the settlers themselves, and until we had exhausted th means which it provided it would be mistaken poUcyt jncur «ny gre»t expense in founding » convict settlement in »uy other part of theworld. Tfaecolonypossessed particula advantages for the purpose. The soil was »daptedfor »gri culture more than for sheep pasturing, so that the popula tion could be kept more compact ; indeed, there ha not been » single case of escape during- the ive years tha convicts hadbeen sent there. It had this advantage«, too that there was hardly any communication by »e.v with th other parts of AustraUa. There was very--Uttle coastin trade, such trade as there was being mostly with Britis India, »lidEngland. But it was only to a certain extent »n for a certain time thst we could look to Western AustraU

One great difficulty was th necessity of keeping up spmethinjïTike an eqS·· between the sexes. He had been in coihmunication with^thl Tmí ption Commissioners on this ??&$?%?? ? srea Wîil'ÎTP'ïi the difficulty. On«r»tep^whi&h should think desurable would be toyaffordg\e»tLmtiâto the conviots to send out for their wives and; cMd5>n Everything that could be done with «h.lobjIctouÄtltote »nd would be done by the Government. ¿TbeUlvedliS it would be neoessary to promote as far as possible the immigration of free emigrants, for it was most important to maintain a good proportion of free settlers in colonies of that description. Under suoh circumstances there were fair grounds for hoping that the colony would ??????? and be a great resource to this country. Even at preaentlunder great disadvantages, the colony of Western AustraUa was far from being in a decaying position. He found that in 1849 the population (no conviots havingbeen then sent there was 5,564 ; in 18o5 the free population was 10,630, besides 2,17o convicts. The revenue in 1849 was 9,5967., and in 1855 it was 10,630¿. Tho imports in 1849 were 28.524Í., and m 1855 no less than 105,320«. The exports in 1849 were 26,156?.,andiul8s5 46,304?. He trusted, therefore, theHonse would perceive there wasgreat hope that the colony under ju dicious management would be found capable of receivin» our convicts to a considerable extent for some time to come" With regard to the expense of the colony, although no doubt it had been large (and aU penal colonies necessarily were expensive), yet he did not beUevo it had been as expensive as penal colonies in general. Transportation to "Western Australia commenced in 1850, since which date 4,194 convicts had been sent there at an expense of 406,000í., while during tho firat 12 years of transportation to New South lváfesJr6i oonviots "ere sent at an expense of more than 1,000,000?. He would not detain the House with any further remarks, but would content himself with expressing his satisfaction at the fair and candid spirit in which the proposal of the Government had been received, as in the course of the debate which had taken place he did not find any diversity of sentiment as far as principle was concerned, and he was especiaUy glad to find that whJe the House was desirous of obtaining a remedy for the evils which existed in our penal code, yet thevwere not unmindful of their obUgations to the British" colonies, and were determined to do nothing .to violate, either in letter or in spint, the agreement of the Government of this country not to interfere with the weU-expressed determination of the colonists upon this subject, Mr. BENTINCK, having listened with great care to the able, and lucid statement of the right hon. baronet, was constrained to say that he had not been convinced that the method proposed by the Government was the best mode of dealing with the subject. He thought means could be found for estabUshing penal settlements nearer home and for utilizing convict labour. There were but three objects to be attained,-to protect society by punishing crime ; to afford to criminals an opportunity of reformation, if so disposed ; and to consider the wishes and interests of the colonists. Those objects could be best attained by resorting to transportation and making use of the labour of conviots in the places to which they were sent. The difficulties of finding fitting penal settlements were already great and likely to increase. The colony now suggested would not be available a few years hence, and the question naturally arose whether it was not better at once to provide a system which might be permanent. The right hon. gentleman said, the labour of convicts had proved extremely beneficial in the colonies to which they had been sent, and he thought he might infer it would be equaUy beneficial to the mother country. The right hon. gentleman said that if theysentconvictatoGibraltar or other places, they would have the expense of bringing them home when the terms of their sentences expired; but surely the value of their labour pendtag sentence would more than cover the cost of passage out and transport home again. They had all heard of the dreadful state of penal settlements, and in his opinion that condition of things would be greatly, improved by having such estabUshments nearer home or in this country, where they would be more directly under the eye of the Government. An objection to the plan was, that there were no means of finding labour except for those capable of doing hard work; but he beUeved that, under proper management, work could be found adapted to every class of convicts, even women, in establishments where their labour might be made profitable to the country. He thought the remission of any portion of the sentence rather an encouragement than a prevention of crime, because there were no possible means of judging between real reformation and the self-command of a clever feUow taking the shortest road out of prison. The right hon. gentleman stated that the use of hulks was in progress of discontinuance, but he would suggest that, if they dealt with their malefactors at home by .employing them upon works on the coast, the old ships laid up in ordinary could not be better appUed. than to saving the erection of large and expensive prisons. There was only one difficulty to be overcome, and that was the morbid sentiment which existed in favour of a convict. An unfortunate labourer might so on year after year, dependent, unless he lived in the vicinity of a man of Uberal disposition and largo means, on parochial assistance ; but, if he went on the high read and committed »n atrocious murder, he became an object of interest and sympathy to thousands. Tho moment he was Êroved to be a miscreant and a felon good people tried to ivest him with aU the attributes of a saint and a maityr, and as long as that maudlin feeling continued crime would be encouraged in this country. (Cheers.) Mr. MILNES said, the noble lord the member for London and the right hon. gentleman the membor for the University of Oxford had expressed their regret that the House had not been called together to discuss the war with Persia; but, if the right hon. gentlemen (Sir G. Grey and Mr. Labouchere) could only have made their speeches a few months ago it was impossible to estimate the immense amount of nonsense and discomfort which would have been spared the country. (Hear, hear.) Of course, the right hon. baronet could not write a letter to Tke Times, but he might have got his constituents to invite him to a dinner, and such a speech then would have been far more valuable than many delivered under similar circumstances. (A laugh.) He knew it was not the right time to discuss the details of this and the subsidiary measure which must go with it, but he hoped when they did discuss it they would show they were not affected by all the falsity and error which had for so long a period prevailed. (Hear, hear.) He regretted that the temper and inclination of the House seemed to go «long with the immediate »nd momentary temper of the country in the sense of greater severity and the establishment of the deterrent rather than the reformatory system of punishment. If there were any persons who expected to solve the problem by making our prisons uncomfortableby thinning the gruel and diminishing the beef-they would find they had mistaken the way of acting, even upon the criminal classes of this country. He denied that there was any ground for beUeving that the inoreased activity of the reformatory and the decreased »ction of the deterrent principle of punishment had been attended with mischievous results. The population of this country was increasing at the rate of 1,000 per day, yet there was a diminution of commitments in 1855 of 4,000, and the right hon. gentleman [Sir G. Grey) had shown that this diminution had continued in 1856. With what face, then, could hon. members say that aU our reformatory action had been a failure 1 There were many causes, such as the cessation of transportation the war and the high price of food, which might have led us to expect an mcrease of crime. But therehad been, on tho contrary, a decrease of crime ; and hon. members who declared that a just treatment of criminals had increased crime had no facts to refer to in support of their views. The system of Ucenses at large had failed in this country, but not from the causes mentioned. He should rather say it had failed because it required a very nice and deUcate procedure on the part of the poUce to which they were not accustomed. What was wanted was something analogous to the police surveillance of foreign countries, in which tie poüce acted tho part of watching the persons in question, but so discreetly as not to damage them in their usual habits of life. Every unhappy man who had received a ticket of leave believed that he had been tracked from door to door by the poUce, so that he Uved without any sense of security or comfort. But the failure of this system had nothing to do with the other question introduced by the right hon. gentleman (Sir G. Grey)-viz., the diminution of punishment on account of good behaviour. This was no encouragement to crime, and if they did not aUow something to good conduot and contrite behaviour they struck at the basis of aU reformatory treatment. He hoped that the hon. member f or Sheffield would not press his motion for a committee, but would aUow the present biU to be introduced and discussed at a second reading. A subject that required attention was the treatment of discharged prisoners. The benefit of the punishment of tiansportation was not so much m the deportation of the criminal during punishment as in the condition and status he acquired »fter he was discharged. That advantage we did not now possess, but it was one which we must attempt to recover or to find a substitute for. We must assist these persons in their attempts to attain a rehabffitation in society, or we ehould find ourselves driven to great difficulties. He re gretted that in the wealthy and populous district of the West Elding only one juvenile reformatory had been esta blished, but there had been established in connexion with the Wakefield House of Correction a prisoners' home in which aU prisoners upon their discharge were re ceived for » certain time, where they were employed under certain strict rules of discipline in remunerativ labour, and encouraged to find work »nd independence out side its walls. He did not think that voluntary mean would meet the difficulty. Some transition state was neces sary, for a prisoner could not be turned out of prison desti tutej and if a sum of money were given him it was spent in dissipation. If they did not make » bridge to facili tate the passage of a prisoner from the class o Eociety they wished him to leave, there would be very Uttle »dvantage in their other measures He would solemnly recommend those considerations to th attention of the House and the Government ; and he woul only further say that when he found that the measure which he and others proposed in that house 10 years ag were now becoming subjects of serious consideration an discussion there he derived encouragement, and hoped, tha 10 years more would not elapse before the principles he ad vocated in connexion with this question were brought int practical operation. (Hear, hear.) Mr. J. G. PHILLIMOEE said, he rof? for the purpose o expressing the great dread he felt lest the House shoul again have recourse to the punishment of transportation for, if any one thing had been established by testimony of th most trustworthy and indisputable kind, it was tbat trans portation was cruel in its nature, degrading to humanity ineffectual for purposes of reformation, and vitiated ever one brought under its influence. He dreaded tha under a.temporary pressure of public feeling the Govern ment might be driven to the adoption of transportation ?? secondary punishment; but he hoped they would «ct with nrmness on the occasion, for, however desirable it might b ^J^Sli^iltavl'^ to some place of a reformatory cha olwhÄb7 ^undergone sentence-in the propriety Sli!feed"4did ?10^ against transportatio «SL^f 5 secondary punishment.

I8p3, when he protestedUga&st »?? for the »bUtion of tensportation, hefound himself rimost rione »nduSup' i£^ 4·^ must ??' h?weyer, while rejoicingthat this subject was now seriously engaging äT^ttention of the Government, he lamented ? the first ttree recommendations to the committee of that House by whbh it was investigated had been totally overlooked or conteayened bythe measures which the Government so^lht to introduce. Those recommendations were, in effect that transportation should be retained as a punishment under sentences passed by judges on the bench ; and he had heard no reason assigned why, when the Government were contemplating a new system of transportation, they ehould in the same measure embody a provision for destroying the punishment of transportation so far as it was at present retained. He could not understand that while there was hope of anew penal colony being discovered the House should be called on rashly to destroy the remnant of a punishment the tampering with which the whole country had cause to regret, and the restoration of which, under somewhat different conditions, was contemplated by the verv measure now under consideration. He had heard means o"f punishment suggested, revolting, as he thought, to the kindly feelmg of this country, such »s the attempt to seclude men for long intervals of time. He could not believe, with tte experience they had had of soUtary confinement, that the House would ever sanction upon a larger scale, or under conditions of greater severity, a punishment from which some of the best feelings of humanity recoiled. In what manner would they carry out a system of perpetual imprisonment? Wasa corner of the island to be cut off and a penal colony formed in it ? The Secretary of Stete would be besieged with aopUcations for the remission of sentences of that land if they were ever passed. The House ought not to be alarmed by the bngbe« of Norfolk Island. The conditions under which that settlement was established were such that it could not succeed. What had been done before might bo done again: and, remembering what had been the results of the establishment of penal settlements in America, m AustraUa, in Van Diemen's Land, he hoped they would not be deterred by the example of Norfolk Island from estabUshing penal settlements ebewl»«re. The pubhc asked to be reheved from the presence of the most dangerous classes of the community, and, as it would be impossible to carry into effect a system of perpetual imprison. mentor of Austrian police in this country, they must lookto toe natural resources afforded them by extended empire. He trusted that thoy would not abolish transportation until they had exhausted every means of discovering a place to which the worst criminals might be transported. Mr. LTODELL thought that the measure about to be introduoed by the right hon. gentleman would be very satisfactory to the country. He was glad to find that a distinction was to be made between the period of punishment and the period of probation, but he was sorry to hear the right hon. gentleman's statement that he wished to abolish the sentence of transportation, as he thought.the aboUtion of that sentence would only render the punishment more uncertain. He hoped that some distinction would be drawn during the probationary period of the convicts existence between the causes which had led them to crime, as there was a great difference between those who committed offences because of a corrupt naturo and those who became criminals upon the impulse of the moment. He wished, in reference to this question, to say a few words with regard to the supply of cotton. lhey. had been told that the supply of cotton was. insufficient, and that they were mainly dependent for it upon America. They had also been told that the cotton of Demerara was equal to that of America, and that 400 estates in that colony had ceased to be cultivated for want of labour. Why should not the Government enter mto a contract with, the planters of the colony to supply them with a certain »mount of the labour of convicts during the probationary period 1 The colony was Uttle short of 1W square miles in extent, and already contained a penal settlement, respecting which he should like to hear some information from the Government. A great de»l was said about the treatment of piisoners, but he conceived that prisoners were treated too weU. A boy ran away from a reformatory in the part of the country with which he was connected, and the reason he gave was, that the diet m prison was so much better that he preferred being committed back again to prison. It was not because the reformatory underfed the boys, but because the prison overfed them. He admired the efforts made by benevolent persons to purge the prisons of obscenity, vice, »nd discomfort to a great degree, and who employed their powers of inteUect to dissect the minds of the convicts, and to draw out the causes which had led them into crime ; but still he had a greater respect for the pubUc after all, and he did not think that a man who was a wilful offender, and who, ???????, had only by accident avoided taking the life of a fellow-creature, deserved so much sympathy as was shown to him in many quarters. (Hear, hear.) He thought it w only just that they should make the labour of the convicts as remunerative to the country as possible, and the best way to effect that object was to send the convict to the colonies, where he had a field for labour and an inducement to work. If they detained him in this country they neither did justice to the man nor to the country. Sir G. GEEY gave some explanation respecting certain cases referred to by Sir J. Pakington. Ho repeated that the observations which Judge WiUes had made in the case referred to he afterwards explained as having been made under a misapprehension of the facte. With respect to the case at Worcester, the right hon. baronet had himself admitted that the recommendations were such as excused the exercise of mercy on the part of the responsible Minister, and he did not think that the House would be of opinion that in no case were circumstances to be taken into consideration after conviction for mitigation of punishment. A petition had been presented to him on behalf of the prisoner by a clergyman of tho church of England, and by persons who had employed him, stating that it was his first offence, and all the documents were sent to Chief Baron Pollock, who tried him, and who, he understood, concurred in the propriety of a mitigation of punishment. Mr. M. GIBSON wished to be allowed to make » somewhat personal explanation. He was informed that the right f.°rn· /ítntiman, when introducing this ??, said thathe (Mr. Gibson) had stated that there had recently been a great increase of crime »nd pauperism. In this the right on. gentleman had misrepresented him. What he said was, that he thought the Government, in the speech from the Throne, had given too favourable a view ofthe condition of the country; that their representations on that subject ought to have been more quaUfied; that to say there existed general weUbeing and contentment was not quite accurate ; that there reaUy prevailed great discontent arising from the amount of pubUc burdens ; and that there was unfortunately a considerable amount of pauperism and crime. He beUeved this to be strictly true, but he did not say there had been »ny recent alarming increase of crime and pauperism. Leave was then given to introduce the ??. REFORMATORY SCHOOLS. Sir G. GREY said, the other bill which he should ask leave to introduce had for its object to facUitate the establishment of reformatory schools in England. The House was aware that the reformatory schools recently established under the authority of the act of ParUament depended for their support entirely upon voluntary contributions. The Secretary of State was at present authorized to pay a certain sum for the maintenance of children placed there instead of being sent to prison, and also had the power to enforce payment for their maintenance from the parents if he saw fit to do so. As, however, these institutions owed their support purely to voluntary efforts, no children could be eent there except with the consent of the managers. Now, great credit was due to those gentlemen who had devoted their attention to the important subject of endeavouring to arrest crime at its source, and the bill was not intended to interfere with their voluntary exertions. (Hear, hear.) But reformatory institutions, although increasing, were still comparatively few in number, »nd were not sufficient for the wants of the country. Under these circumstances, it was pressed upon him last session that it would be most desirable to introduce a bill authorizing counties and boroughs, out of the county and borough rate, or other funds at their disposal, to establish reformatories of this kind ; »nd the object of the present ?? was to en»ble them to do so. (Hear, hear.) The measure was » per missive one only. Counties and boroughs might, if they pleased, establish separate institutions of their own · or there were provisions under which they were empowered to unite for this purpose, »nd thus to establish by joint »ction » reformatory on a Urger scale and more completo in its arrangements than could be formed if they acted »lone This, however, would of course be quité optionaL The provisions of the law under which children would be admitted to reformatories wonld remain the same ?? *t present, except that, where these institutions would be supported out of the county or borough rate it would no longer be optional on the part of the managers to refuse to receive children who might be sent there, unless of course they happened to be full. Justices were also empowered to aid schools by grants, either by sums in gross, or by periodical payments, subject to such arrangements ?? might be agreed upon between the managers and the justices as to the reception of chil dren. The bill contained a great many details, into which it was not at present necessary to enter ; but the object, he repeated, was merely to enable the authorities of
iountiesandooronghs to establish the»reform»tories*ub. jeet to the provisions of the existing law. (Hear.) In answer to Mr. Scott, ^SirG.

London, Tuesday, February 10, 1857.
LONfDON, TUESDAY, FEBBUABY 10, 1857.
In the House of Lords last night,
A bill providing for a remedy against frivolous and vexatious law proceedings was read a first time on the motion of Lord BRoUGaAIs.
Lord LThDH-OST asked Lord CLARENDON whether he had any objection to produce a copy of the Colonial Ordinance under which a register had been granted to the Chinese lorcha, the Arrow, together with a copy of the register itself ? He also called attention to a recent article in the Moniteur, and wished to ask whether the Divans which were to meet in the Danubian Principalities were to consider the propriety of uniting those two provinces ?
The Earl of CLARENDON replied that there could be no objection to produce the colonial ordinance referred to, but in respect to the register itself there was this difflculty-that it was not the custom to send home copies of such documents. With regard to the other question put by the noble Lord, he had seen the article in the Mooniteur with some surprise, but there was certainly no bar to the discussion by the Divans of a proposition for the union of the Danubian Principalities, though at the present moment he would rathier not enter into any discussion of the subject.
The Earl of DERaBY returned to the question of the lorcha Arrow, and to the conduct of Sir JOHN BOWnIxO, and pressed for the production of further papers connected with the matter.
A desultory discussion then ensued, in the course of which Lord CLARENDON promised to produce some of the papers specified, after which the matter dropped.
The Duke of AioYLL, in reply to Lord DuiGANrwOx, explained the modifications which were about to be made in the existing system in order to remedy the inefficiencies complained of in the postal service between Dnblin and Holyhead.
Some other business was then despatched, after which their Lordships adjourned.
In the House of Commons,
The CH"cELLoR of the EXCHEQEiR announced that the Navy Estimates would be laid upon the table of the House this day, and the Army Estimates on Wednesday, and that he would make his financial statement on Friday next.
In reply to Mr. LAYARD,
Mir. V. S%rum stated that FERUK KHAN-, the Persian Ambassador to the Emperor of the FRENCH, had received from his Court further and full instructions for negotiation with the British Government.
In answering inquiries made by Mr. LOCKE and Mr. W.. WILLLvAts respecting Westminster-bridge,
Sir B. HALL stated the intentions of the Government with reference to that and other works connected with the New Palace.
Sir G. GREY, in moving for leave to bring in a bill to amend the act of 1853, substituting, in certain cases, other punishment in lieu of transportation, shortly stated the reasons for the change introduced by the act,-namely, the cessation of a demand in the colonies for convict labour, aud the general and strong feeling of the colonists against the reception of criminals,-the main provisions of the act, and the system, incluidiDg tickets of leave, under wlhich those provisions were carried out. He then proceeded to show what had been the effects of the act of 1853, so far as appeared from the number of sentences of transportation and penal servitude passed at different periods, the number of licenses granted on the ground of good conduct, and those revoked for misconduct or forfeited by re-conviction. In giving these details Sir GEonGR explained the rules and principles which guided the Secretary of State in granting letters of license, and declared his belief that the alarm excited by the liberation of convicts under tickets of leave, although to a certain extent well founded, had been greatly exaggerated. Lookinc, at the generat state of crime in the last two years, lie found that, while there was a smal fractional increase in the snmmary convictions, the committals for trial had decreased from 25,922 in 1855 to 19,433 in 1856, or about 25 per cent., notwithstandina the disbandig of the militia. This state of things did not, he thought, justify the great alarm prevalent in the country. Sir GEORGE then adverted to the reports of the committees of both Houses which sat last se3sion, who concurred in recommending a continuance of transportation, as far as practicable. To carry this proposal into effect without a breach of the engage. nients entered into with the colonies, which the Government had not the remotest intention to violate, was, hovever, the great difficulty. Western Australia was Ft present the only colony which would receive convicts. Its capabilities wer_g.said to be great, and the colonists had been represhted to be desirous of convict labourers. After fuU consideration, the Government had determined to propose to give effect to the reconimendation of the committee of the House of Commons that tbe sentence of penal servitude should be lengthened so as to makc it of the same duration as that of transportation under the old law, and they proposed to remove all obstacles to the removal of convicts sentenced to penhViierVitude to Any possession ofthe C.RowN, so that su671 a sentenco should curry with it, thouglt int neeeo.
warily, removalfroom the country, the Government 4eing thereby enabled to send convicts to Western Australia, or to avail themselves of any additional facilities ior their transportation to other penal set3tlements. Withregard to those convicts, under sentence of penal servitude who WouId be kept at home, hie indicated his vews as, to the rules which should gvern remissions of the sentence, and proposed, ihe said, to maintain the power. wvhich he thought 'useful to retain, of granting the conditional licenses caUed tickets of leave. A few minor points -ere touched upon by Sir GEoROB, one of which related to the hulk system, which was, he said, in Xprocess of abandonment.
Sir J. PAKILNGTON thought the alarm regarding the ticket-of-leave system was misdirected rather than exaggerated. With respect to the proposals of Sir G. GREy he thought it would be better to wait instil the bill was before the House. The question mnvolyed two points-first, what was to be the 3tate of the law as to secondary punishments; Isecond, the mauner in which the law was to be sadmimstered and carried out. There was an impression, he said, that there had been an indiscreet exercise of the prerogative of mercy by the advisers -of the CROWS, which he believed was exaggerated, but not witlhout foundation; ar d that the punishinent under sentences of penal servitude was not _nade sufficiently penal. He thought the inference which the public would draw from the -comparison between the crime of 1855 and 1856 %vas that there had been a decrease to the extent rtated by Sir G. GRE:Y in the grLver crimes, whgZeas by a change in the law during the interva large class of offences, formerly left for trial, 'Were dealt with summarily.
4r. COLLIER contended that with respect to our 1wdA crin)inals it would be far better to imprison theor for life at home than to incur the expense of imprisoning them abroad. The next class might be -dealt with as proposed by the Government, either by transportation or penal servitude at home.
Sir J. Rx-.)SDynx doubted whether the advantages attending transportation, as a secondary punishnient and as a reformatory process, were not overrated, though it was diicult to exaggerate its importance to the mother country. The proposals of the Government, he thought, deserved the approbation of the House, but he hoped their attention 'would be directed to a change in the condition and -treatment of prisoners.
Mr. ADDERLEY cordially concunred with everything that had fallen from Sir G. GP.Ex, suggesting, however, wbether it would not be better to abolish altogether the ticket-of-leave provision, the few -sdvanta;es attending which were overbalanced bv its evils. ffe dwelt upon the obstacles in the way of transporting our convicts, which be attributed to that Mlinister who attempted to force them upon an -unwiUing colony.
Mr. LAI:OUiOERX observed that, although it 3night be doubted whether transportation had in all cases a deterring effect, there was no question that, as a means of disposing of a part of our criminal population, for home purposes, it was a most valuable secondary punishment. He would not say that besides Western Australia other places might not be fitted to receive convicts; but hepointed out objections to Vancouver's Island, -the Gulf of Carpentaria, and the Falkland Islands. 'Western Australia possessed many advantages as a colony wbere the labour of convicts could be employed; at the same time he should not be justified, he said, in holding out an expectation that it -would be available, except to a certain extent and for a certain time, the measure requiring the utmost caution and the most judicious manage-ment.
Mr. BSTIN-CK was not convinced that the meaBures proposed by the Government were calculated to effect the object in view, which, in his opinion, would be inore readily attained by establishing penal settlements nearer home, and by utilizing convict labour in this country. He condemned the morbid sentiment in favour of a convict.
Mr. MISLNES denied that the reformatory action had proved a failture, the contrary being shown by the state of crime during the last two years, and he -strongly urged attention to the treatment of dis-charged prisoners.
MIr. J. PHILL11onRi expressed his dread of returning to transportation, and protested against it being used as a secondary punishment, as it did not deter from crime, and hardened the criminal.
Mr. NEW)FGAkTE, having protested in 1.853 against, abolishing transportation, appealed to the increase I of crines, accompanied by violence, and insisted upon the impossibility of establishing a system of perpetual inmprisonment.
Mr. LIDD-ELL inquired whether there would be any -objection on the part of the Government to enter into a contract with the planters of British Guiana to supply themn with convicts, many estates in Demerara, adapted to the grofth of excellent cotton,
perishin,g for wsnt of labour? H3e thought the labour.' -of conviLts might be mlade otherwrise available.
In his reply, Sir G. GREW gave explanations'S relative to matters adverted to by Sir J. PAxIxo-: -ToN-; and, after a few words from MIr. GImsoN, ! leave was given to bring in the bill.
Sir G. GREY then moved for leave to introduce a biU to facilitate the establishment of reformatory schools in Eugland. It was not, he said, the design of the bill to interfere with voluntary institutions, but to enable counties and boroughs to establish such schools out of the county and borough rates.
After some remarks by Mr. DEEDnxs, Sir J. PArNGTï¿½oN, T Mr. ALcocx, 31r. ADDERL}EY, and Sir -S. NORThCOTE, leave was given to bring in the bill.
Sir M. BERKELEY obtained leave to bring in a bill to amend the act for limiting the time of service in the Royal Marine forces.
Leave was likewise given to introduce certain other bills; and, after some further business, the House adjourned at a quarter past 11 o'clock.

The House of Commons is promised, what ap-
The House of Commons is promised, what ap-pears to he its heart's desire, a whole week of Estiniates and Finance. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCREQCERt laid the bill of fare before it last night, with the ev-dent consciousness that he was doing something agreeable. Here it is:-Navy Estimates to be laid on the table to-day, distributed to-morrow; Army Estinmates to be laid on the table to-morrow, distributed on Friday; on which evening, "if " the House do not object to so early a day," -we are to have the Financial Statement. As the House will not settle to anything else while they remain in uncertainty on this interesting subject, it is a simple economy of time and strength to discharge it at once. Every evening, and almost every hour, somebody has been putting questions to the CHANC:ELLOR of the ExOHEQUESi ; and about a dozen gentlemen fron different parts of the House may now write to their respective constituents that they have extorted this despatch fron a reserved and dilatory Government. Now, one answer may do for one man, but not for G4 ; and, if the Minister has anythingo to say worth saying, he would rather not let it ooze out in a succession of unguarded replies. On
Friday, thien, we are to hear that Budget wlich, I in the present state of the general pocket, naturaly exciti-s more anxiety than all the questions of transportation, penal servitude, law reform, buirdens on shipping, China, Persia, Russia, and Turkey ptut together. No wonder that it shouli. Except a very select class of millionaires, w-ho either have got into the way of saving or have not yet got into the way of spending, everybody is wanting money. Everybody is keenly alive to the value of his direct contribution to the war,-that is, to its value if he could apply it otherwise. In the last year the national expenditure was not very far from a hundred aillions-ninety-five, we believe, was the exsot figure-and of that thirty-five at least was extraordinary, anl aas much lost to all reproductive purposes as if it had been thrown into the sea. This tells on Us all. Everybody feels, not only what lie has had to pay himself, but, often much more, the general poverty and stringenxcy around him. So let it not be, set down to a declining patriotism, or to a flagging in the great objects of the late war, if the British public are exceedingly anxious to know how much more they have to pay for it.
It is only a question of Estimates. The House of Commons would never agree to another loan on
account of the late war, or to a new temporary tas to wipe off arrears. If, then, the expenditure will not admit of any reduction of the existing taxes, we have only to bear them. The public, hoowever, cmboldened by the example of many a previous reduction, has a very just opinion of the elasticity of the expenditure. We know not how it is, for in private life people continually say they cannot retrench. In the affairs of the nation they seem to thinlk nothing so easy as to knock off a million or two from the outgoings. But eveen then it does seemn a good deal to expect that honest and businesslike gentleman Sir G. CoR.nEc WvAiL Lxwis with a stroke of his pen to reduce the suIn total of our taxation between 7,000,0001. and 8,000,0001. That is the amount depending on the additional 9d. in the pound for the year which has accidentally come within the long ranrge of the Income Tax Act, and in the end it is the amount that must be sacrificed by giving up the 9d. A little management might mitigate the immediate pressure of the sacrifice, for, as we should not get in the whole proceeds of the tax till late in the year, the Treasury might be strong enough to bear the reduction by that timie. But from first to last it would be seven or eight millions deducted from the public receipts. Vain, then, would it be to suppose that this is possible without a large reduction of the expenditture, below not only last year, but the anticipations for this year. On this point, however, we have some hope,
from what has transpired with regard to the Esti- i mates. For example, it is stated that while the ex-
penditure for the Navy for the year endingDecember I the 31st, 1855, was more than 19,000,0001., besides the 5,000,0001. voted expressly for the war, and for the year ending December the 31st, 1856, was still 16,000,0001., besides a small vote for the war, the estimate for the next financial year has been brought down to 8,000,0001. If the other services have been found equaUy tractable, it is quite possible that the CH"NoLxoR of the EX(VEQUER may be able next Friday to make a more gratifying announcement than we have ever encouraged the public to expect.
Should the Estimates prove as satisfactory as is rumoured, and should the announcements of next Friday prove in unison with them, it would be a great additional satisfaction if, as we have some reason to hope, HER MAjESTY's Ministers should at the same time be able to tell us something equally pleasant about the Persian war. A very uneasy impression has been produced by the news that possibly a British army may now be on its march to Shiraz, without a chance of reporting progress in this country for two months to come. The British Government has undertaken half the cost of the war, and, though the loss of money is not to be put before the loss of men, yet the loss of money is the loss of men, the loss of employment, comfort, health, and life. Ten millions cainot be added to the national expenditure, on war or other unprofitable purposes, without starving trade, diminishiing work, turning labour adrift, closing factories and workshops, driving families out of houses into lodgings, suspending building operations, preventing marriages, and, in a word, producing, only more quietly, all the evils that befall the population at the seat of war itself. So, we hope and trust the cheerful faces that greet us in Ministerial circles augur something more than financial promises. 'Those promises wiU carry much more weight if they are founded on peace. As for the Chinese affair, though a war w-ith a city full of silly barbarians is not an agreeable, nor, indeed, a very honourable enterprise, it has the merit of comparative cheapness. This cannot be said of the Persian war, wlhih will prove a costly luxury, if it is to involve us in a march inland from Bushire. Should we be told that matters are in training for a settlement we shall. hear of the abandonment of the 9d. additional incometax with additional pleasure, and with no misgiving that it will ever be missed.

Sir GEORGE GREY yesterday evening obtained
Sir GzORc.n GREY yesterday evening obtained leave froni a numerous and attentive House to bring in a bill which should embody the conclusions at which during the Recess the Government had arrived on the subject of transportation. Although these conclusions are not such as will satisfy the zealots of peculiar theories, yet 'we are happy to say they will, if thorougl-ay carried out in practice, once more coiimit the country to the good old system of remnoinig a large portion of our incorrigibles to anotber part of the globe. WVithout entering into details, were we required to give the gist of the Gov-rnment proposition in a phrase or two, we shouLld say that it consists in the assimilation of the higher class of offenders who may have been sentenced to penal servitude to the class of criminals wlho have been sentenced to a term of transportation exceeding fourteen years, and placing them equally at the disposal of the Home-office for purposes of deportation. Western Australia is the locality chosen for the inception, or rather for the renewal of tbis great experimeent. We are firmly convinced, as far as the choice of the locality is concerned, that Sir GEonOy GumY has but adjourned the difficulty of his case for a few years; but there isno reason why lhe should not give Western Australia the first turn, since the colonists really desire the services uf convicts from the mother country. Say that three, five, ten years can be thus gained-it is so muclh gained. Meanwhile, the facilities of transit to all portions of the globe are so continually on the increase that, in all probability, by the time WVestern Australia, as far as convict labour is concerned, has reached the point of saturation, and social phenomena have there declared themselves similar in kind to those which have recently been exhibited in New South Wales and in Tasmania, we shall be able, without much difficulty, to find some other spot where the system of transportation may be carried out. It would, however, be impossible to iinsist too strongly upon the point that Western Australia is but an expedient. We must sedulously employ the breathing time which* we have gained by the demand for labour which subsists in that colony in the selection of some fresh spot which may answer our purpose for a yet longer period.
We have to deal with three distinct classes of convicts-the positives, the comparatives, and the superlatives of crime. There is not much difficulty in arriving at a fixed resolution with regard to the first and the last of these clsses. We must make up our minds to keep the first at home and to use every endeavour for their reformation. All the machinery of reformatories, of model prisons, of industrial training, of moral and religious teaching which canbe broughttobearuponthem,willno doubt be employed in their cases. We can but hope that when the worst criminals are removed from the country for ever the convicts who have expiated short sentences at home may not find every man's hand against them when they come out of prison as completely as at present. With the third class-the absolutely and enormously bad-again there is no great perplexity of thought. They must simply be confined for life. Society has a right to defend ilself against these persons, as a householder would defend himself against a burglar in the dead hour of night-as a belated traveller through the Indian jungle would have a right . to protect his life against the tiger whose eyes -were glaring upon him till he came within the peril of the fatal spring. We lock up criminal
lunatics, who are indeed,, in the majority of cases, no lunatics at all in the medical sense of the word. There is no substantial distinction between the case of such persons and the case of the ruffians who commit crimes of the most heinous kind, and who receive a long sentence, as it is caUed, of transportation. Incarceration in a lunatic asylum for life more comnnonly represents the reluctance of a jury to consign a prisoner to the scaffold than anything else. Sir GEoBGE GP;EY in his address to the House last night did not indicate the locality in which this sentence of imprisonment for life was to take effect, but we most earnestly trust that some distant island may be selected far from our shores. The humanity of the age will not in any case permit even these wretches to be treated with unnecessary severity ; bat, at any rate, let them be remitted to some place of secure confinenent at. the other side of the globe, without a tlhought in their case of remission of their sentence or of conditional pardon.
It is with refcreicc to the intermediate class that the chief difficulty exists ; but with regard even to the persons who are comprised under this category there is no difficulty at all in selecting places where they may expiate the penal portion of their sentences. The real perplexity arises when we task our ingenuity to find some spot in whliich they may find honest means of subsistence when their term of imprisonment is oLt. Sir GEORGE GREY told the House last night that he was constantly oblig,ed to refuse the requisitions of the First Lord of the Admiralty for convicts to work at Portland, Portsmouth, Chatham, and Gibraltar, because he only had at his disposal about 250 convicts annually who had received sentences of transportation. As the law stands at present the Secretary of State has no power to send the convicts who nmay have received sentence of penal servitude out of the country, and that is just the point on which the law is chiefly to be altered. We will quote the very words of the Home Secretary :-" The provisions of "the act of 1853, by which the shorter sentences
of penal servitude were substituted for the longer " sentences of transportation, will be repealed, " and persons who may fornerly have been sen"tenced to transportation wiU be rendered liable "to be kept in penal servitude for the same "duration as the term of transportation for which
they were liable before the act passed." The new system is to borrow something from the old system of transportation, and something from the modern system of penal servitude. From the former it takes, time; from the latter, form. The penal servitude man will not necessarily be depozned, but it will be within the discretion of the Government to deport him at pleasure. If the meaning of this rule be rigidly carried out with regard to the worst crininals, save in cases of undoubted physical disability, it may do well enough; but all will depend upon the matter of adiinistration. If we understand the Home Secretary's statement aright, the aunnal average of convicts who will fall under the operation of the new act will be about 2,500 persons. This number represents the convicts who have received sentence of iransportation, as well as those who have been consigned to penal servitude. Sir GEouoE GREY does not propose to send abroad those convicts who may have received sentence for short terms.
We have been so anxious to state clearly the chief points of innovation to be introduced by the new measure, that we have not room to deal with Sir GEORGE Gniucys history of our ticket-of-leave men. It appears that we have but a smaU balance under the old law, and it never was intended under the law of 1853 to shorten the terms of penal servitude, save in very special cases indeed. In point of fact, only 53 penal servitude men have been liberated, and these because they had been sentenced by the Judge who tried them to a period of penal servitude thlice as long as, in the opinion of that very Judge, their offences deserved. The sentences had been passed under the impression that it was the intention of the Government to inflict only one-third of the punishment awarded. This, however, is matter of history, and, although there are many points on which this new measure is open to criticism, we accept it cheerfully, as evidence of an intention on the part of the Government to banish the worst criminals from the country.

A tolerably voluminous collection of the
A tolerably volurainous collection of the Papers relating to the proceedings of HER "MAJESTVS Naval Forces at Canton" has now been laid before Parliament, and we can apply the test of actual record and authentic detail both to the arguments employed upon the question at the opening of the debates, and to the statements hitherto curTent from other sources of information. Many of these papers have already been published, but others of no small interest appear for the first tine; and, in addition to these, we are presented with the veritable text of the treaties wvhiclh the Chinese are charged with breaking. By the aid of such documents the whole case can be completely and intelligibly constructed, nor need anybody be at a loss for materials on which to found his opinion upon the justice of the war.
Lord DERBy observed, on Tuesday evening, that he " did not say that the Chinese had not violated " the treaty into which they enteredc;l" but, after this prudent salvo, he proceeded nevertheless to impeach the successive steps taken by the British authorities. He expressed very great doubts whether the Arrow was under the protection of the British flag; he questioned the legal validity of the colonial register by which the rights of the vessel were conveyed; he conceived that the offer of the Chinese to restore all the captives, except the chief delinquent, should, even if insufficient in itself, have been accepted in preference to the alternative of war; he censured the hostile proceedings of the British forces, and he represented it as doubtful whether tlhe exaction of our right of admission into the city of Canton would bo attended with any real advantage to our trade and position in those parts. These several allegations embrace every point of the case, and we can now bring conclusive evidence to bear upon all of them.
With respect to the nationality of the Arrow there remains not the slightest ground of justification on the part of the Chinese. She was a vessel which had obtained at Hongkong under the colonial register a title to carry the British flag and enjoy its protection. Whether this system of registration is or is not consistent with British law is a point totally beside the question at issue. It was, at any rate, binding on the Chinese, for it had been reduced to the form of a regular ordinance, had been ratified by an Order in Council, and, what sets the point completely at rest, had been communicated to the Chinese Commissioner, and by him officially recognized. There can be no doubt, therefore, that a register obtained at Hongkong communicated British rights to a vessel obtaining it. But had the Arow actually acquired this character, and did she retain it at the moment of the outrage? These points also are placed beyond doubt. As to the original character of the craft, on 'which Yira founded one of his excuses, that is a matter quite foreign to the case, inaumuch as it conciraed the
-Hongkong authorities alone, and fell under their decision and regulations.. When the register had been granted and paid for the Arrow was entitled to carry British colours and to be regarded as a British vessel. This register, however, was in force onlY for one year, at the expiration of which period it became necessary to renew it, whereas the term in question had expired in the ease of the Arrow eleven days before the outrage. But even this accident brings no impunity to the Chinese. Not to mention that YM was entirely ignorant of the fact, it is provided by the regulating ordinance that application for the renewal of a register, which in case of a vessel at home is to be made one week before the expiration of the year, may be made, in the case of an absent vessel, at any time on her rdturn to the waters of the colony. Nor is this anything but simple reason, for if no allowance were made on such a score any registered veasel detained at sea by stress of weather, or in a foreign port by press of business, would be liable at any moment to lose the protection in reliance upon which she sailed. So much for the law of the case thus far, which leaves the Chinese without a loophole of escape. Let us now turn to the facts.
Yzir, the Imperial Commissioner, knowing full well and not denying that his troops had no right for the purposes in question to board a vessel carrying the British flag, alleged, first, the argument above disposed of, concerning the original character of the Arrow, and next that she had not the British flag flying, and had no foreigner (i. e., British subject) on board. The documents nowv before us contain the perfect justification of Consul PARKES in treating this point as beyond dispute. It is true that THoSAs lE--FDY, the master of the Arrow, was not on board of her at the moment, for he happened to have gone on board the Dart, then lying 50 yards off; but from this vessel he himself, and JOIx MeACH, of the Dart, distinctly saw the English ensign hauled down by the Mandarin's people on the deck of the Arrow. Their depositions to this effect are confirmed by that of a Chinese, one of the Arrow's crew, who circumstantially states that a Eoldier, in obedience to a Mandarin, hauled down the ensign flying at the time on the mni7enmast, and "flung it on the "deck without unreefing it from the halyards." M1oreover, the Arrow had her name painted on her stern in large Roman as well as Cbinese characters. We have stated these facts to show the force of the evidence against the Imperial Commissioner; but they are almost superfluous, for it is impossible to read even his own statements without discerning that he had, in reality, set the nationality of the Arrow at defiance, and only cast about for excuses at an after period, when he was called to account with unexpected firnness.
But, were his offers of reparation sufficient, at all events, to obviate the necessity of a ru-pture? By no means. They never so much as touched the real point at issue between the two conflicting authorities. The man specialy claimed and seized on board the Arrow was a reputed pirate, along with whome, however, the Chinese arrested 11 others. Fourteen days after the occurrence, and when our men-of-war had commenced operations by the seizure of a junk-, YEH at length offered to satisfy our claim for the restoration of the prisoners by sending back 10 out of the 12, and, when further pressed, by sending the whole 12, but with a demand that the particular two should be returned to him at once. This is the proceeding which Lord DERBY described as an offer of the Chinese "to restore the crew, retaining the man," and which he thinks should have been deemed so far satisfactory as to preclude further operations. But this would have left the victory completely with YEH. The ninth article of the Supplementary Treaty of October 8, 1843, provides expressly that if Chinese subjects, being offenders, shall be ascertained or suspected by Chinese authorities to have taken refuge either in the British colony or on board British ships of war or British merchant ships, they shall be reclaimed by communications made through the proper British officers. The offender in this case was the alleged pirate, the merchant vessel was the Arrow, and the proper officer was Consul PARRES. Our complaint was that the Chinese had broken the treaty by violently boarding the Arrow themselves, and our demand was that the captives should be returned as publicly as they were seized, with an apology for the transgression, and an assurance for the future. YnH gave what the Consul was willing to accept as the latter pledge; he withheld all apology, he kept back the particular individual on whose capture the whole case hinged, and, when at length he produced him, it was simply for show, and not for that joint examination by a mixed court of Chinese and British whic]h the occasion required.
Concerning the hostile character of our proceedings we may content ourselves with asking what resource, after remonstrance, expostulation, and menace had been fruitlessly exhausted, remained to be appealed to ? We first fired blank cartridge, as it were, by seizing a Chinese junk; but this had no more effect than our written representations, and as a whole fortnight had elapsed, and YEH refused our authorities any interview, we should be glad to hear anybody explain what, considering our position in the face of an Oriental populace, was then to be done. Touching our right to enter Canton, the 2d article of Commissioner KEYING'S agreement, dated April 6, 1847, leaves no room for exception to be taken :-" It is therefore now agreed that two "years from this day's date British officers and "people shaU have freo entralwe into the city." A right so clearly and plainly conveyed we were, of ,course, at liberty to enforce when we pleased, and with or witlhout any fresh opportunity. But Lord DERBY " doubts whether the literal fulfil" ment of the Treaty of Peklin will tend to aug" ment our trade with Canton," On this point also the papers before us convey a very remarkable and authentic piece of information. Better judges of such a matter could hardly be found than in the " East India and China Association of " London"-a body comprising many members with " personal connexions and a large amount of "property at stake in China, and being deeply " interested in thet uninterrupted maintenance of
Cour commercial intercourse with its people." Now this Association, so describing itself, addressed through its Chairman a commnunication to Lord CLARENDON on the 6th of last month in which they expressed a deliberate and well-founded opinion that " If free intercourse were in-isUed "upon and established at Canton we 7uave no doubt "that animosity would gradually subside, and that
our commercial transactions there would be "carried on with the same mutual satisfaction as "at the northern ports, especiaUy at Shanghai, w"here the increase of trade exceeds all expecta"tion." However, therefore, the outbreak of war may be deplored, it is quite incontestable that we have a sound cause, and that the demands on which we are now insisting are not only justifiable in themselves, but are calculated to obviate such ruptures for the futulre.

TO THE EDITOR OF TEHE TIMES.
Sir,-It is with great reluctance that I request you to Insert a few lines in your columns in explanation of the paragraphs that have appeared in several newspapers, in consequence of the step which Mr. Rogers, of the Olympic Theatre, has thought proper to take with reference to his payment for services rendered at the performance at Windsor Castle.
When performers are singly engaged at the Palace their remuneration is allotted according to a scale, which has never, to my knowledge, been questioned; but when it occasionally happens that the greater number of the performers for the evening's entertainment are taken from one theatre, and the mananer finds it necessary to close his house for the night, he receives a sum of money in payment of the services of himself and his company, which are transferred to Windsor Castle, instead of being given at his theatre in London. When a theatre closes for this purpose every person of this company receives the same salary to which he would have been entitled if the theatre had remained open to the public, and those members who are engaged at WVindsor, in addition to the payment of every incidental expense, roceive an extra night's salary. Mr. Wigan closed his theatre, and Mfr. Rogers, therefore, must have been paid as much again as if he had acted on that night in London. Individual salaries are not speci6ed, but the managcr names tho aggregate sam, which is handed to him accordingly. Until I read the paragraphs in the newspapers I was not aware that 13s. 4d. was Mr. Rogers's nightly payment at the Olympio Theatre.
I remain, Sir. yvour obedient servant.

COTTONY.
TO TEIE EDITOR OF THE TIL[E5.
Sir,-In reference to your article on the produc-. tion of cotton, are your mercantile readers awarethat in one of our eastern colonies this article used to grow in abundance, and of the finest quality ?
The colony I allude to is that of the Seychelles. Islands, a dependency of Mauritius, which used to be famous for the staple oE its cotton. Of late years
the dearth of labour has caused its discontinuance ;.. but were the same steps taken to insure a steady supply of Indian labour there as have succeeded so wonderfully in the main island of Ilauritius 1 feel confident that one large field of production would be opened to the manufacturers of Manchester. At any rate, I would advise them to apply to the Colonial-office on the subject.

For all purposes of trade and commerce Ireland is as much a part of this kingdom as Yorkshire or Lancashire and yet, nevertheless, as the law now stands, a judgment iJn one of our superior courts, which is available against property in either of these countries, is of no use whatever against a debtor's property in Ireland.
To enable it to beso a fresh action has tobe commenced, and another judgment obtained; and, to enable this to be effected process must be served upon the debtor in Ireland.
It follows, therefore, that an absentee Irish proprietor may go on incurring debts in England, and if, as ofterr happens, he is an Irish Peer, there are no means of compelhng him to pay his debts, no matter how large an income he may be deriving from his Irish estates.
The followring observations of thejudges of the Court of Exchequer in Ireland on a recent apolication to enable
roceedings tobe taken there upon an English judgment wl fully bear out what I have stated:
A party recoyers in LEngland against an Irish reer resident there.. ; shm person Is privileged fronm arrest, and who has no propedrty ix Eneland, but very considerable here. In England the creditor cannot bave any fruits of bis judgment either against the person or tbe property of the defendant. Heo comes herw, therefore, to ask usato make the dtfendant against whom be has this unditputed judgmjent debt, amenablae to the law, and that his property here shaU srrdb,

We hasnomeans of ectifyng the
Surely, Sir, this is a discreditable state of the law, and it is because I think I perceive in Colonel French's sneering inquir the other night, when the bill was read a frst time, "w 'hether it was the bill that had been successfully resisted. for the last four or five sessions," that efforts will aeain be made in that quarter to throw it over, and because f think it discreditable to the Ministry of the day that, to please their Lish supporters, they have hitherto assisted in defeatin SO useful a measure, that I desire to draw public attention to it.
And what is this measure, to which so much interested' opposition has been raised I It is simply this,-to enact "that where judgment has been obtained in tho court of Westminster a rcenmorial thereof reg'stered in Ireland, and rice vetsad shaU have the effect of a judgment of the court in which it is so registered." So that, instead of having toh find the debtor in Ireland (where, at present, he takes care not to be), an Englihh judgment can be transferred to Ireland, on registering in the courts there a memorial of tha English judgment, and the debtor's property bo made available for the payment of the judgment.
I have anxiously watched the previous bills on the same subject introduced into Parliament in prior sessions, and. Mr. Craufurd deserves the best thanks of the English publie for the perseverance he has shown in support of his most useful measure.
His bil was first introduced in 1854, when, after repeaxted delays, it was read a second time. It was then referred to a select committee, of which the Advocate-General, Mr. Lowe, and Mr. Napier (or Mr. Whiteside) were members. It was afterwards read a third time and passed and sent to the Lords, but so well had its opponents done their work that it arrived there too late to be further proceeded with.
In 1855 it was again brought in, when, strange to say, tles same Houso that had, after much careful consideration, passed it in 1854, rejected it on the second reading.
In 1856 it was again introduced, but its opponents hadl played their parts so well that it was not read a third tirneuntil the close of the session.
This year it has been introduced, endorsed by the Law Amendment Society, and I trust will in a shiort time become law; but, as the same devices as heretofore will, no doubt, be again resorted to, I trust, Sir, that it may also have your watohful eye to support it.
Ism, Sir, your obedient servant.

The Military Outrage At The Chatham Post-
THE MILITAnY OUTRAGE AT THE CHATHAM PosrOFiCEx.-The postmaster, Mr. J. Dadd, who was so severely injured in the attack made on him by a party of soldiers belonging to the Provissional battalion, was yesteiday afternoon sufficiently recovered to attend at tho BrigadeMlajor's-office, Chatham barracks, for the purpose of identilying those inen wbo are in custody on suspicion of being concerned in the outrage. It is now known that there were 10 men engaged in the attaok on the post-office, some of whom werc dressed in private clothes, which no doubt led to their being mistaken for civilians; seven: men have been placed in close confinement on sFUpicion of having taken part in the outrage, and of tlese four have been identified by MLr. RandaU, of the Mitre Hotel, and two women who witnessed the affair. One of the soldiers now in custody has also been recognised as the man who stabbed the sailor, Franklin, in the groin. There are stiU three soldiers at large who were mixed up in. the outrage, but steps bave been taken to apprehend them. The men lnt custody belong to the 52d Light Infantry and the 87th 1coyal Irish Fasiliors. Daring the night pickets patrolled the streets to spprehend any soldiers found out of barracks, Another investigation by the military authorities is ordered to take place this morning at the Brigadeoffice, Chatham-barracks, at 10 o'clock.
AUSTBEALIAN BLACK SAND.-The aecounts recently published in this journal of his Excellency's Murray expedition contained several allusions to the celebrated " black sand" of the sister colony. This black sand being chiefly stream tin, with a small adminxture of gold, is exceedingly valuable as an article of commerce. The Victorian Government, however, have laid an embargo upon its shipment, and wil not suffer it to be put on board the Murray boats. Hundreds of tons of the interdicted articlewere lying ready for shipment on board the Murray packets ; ut although the owners of the sand wished to, SIP it the Victorian Government p laced a veto upon its exportation, unless forwarded vid 3telbourne. To convey it to Melbourne would occasion such heavy expenses that the diggers' profits would be swallowed up in the charges of conveyance, aud they therefore prefer to let the sand He neglected and profitless where it is stored. Sir Richard Wl'Donnell very properly remonstrates against this iliberal policy on the part of the Victoriau Government and we now refer to the subject, in order to express our Lope that a communication will ho opened up with the Victorian Government on the subject, if that has not been already done. on the subject of black saud we may state that it is Fait
large quantities of it exist in this colony. Samples have, been exhibited at our office, and thousands of tons ara alfrmed to be obtainable. If samples were brought in from various quarters it would be desirable to have conpetent anlyses made of the artiele. The black sand is Eometimnes worth as much as 701. or SlO per ton, but It frequently proves to be charged with iron instead of tin. It is, however, only mecessary to have recourse to proper teat in order to ascertAin the real worth of the article alleged t. exist in large quantities among ourselves. Failing a rioh goldfield, it would pay us very well if we could discover a good diggings of black sand at 701. per ton.-Adcdaif ol,scm-cr.

A private letter from Athens, dated the 28th of January, mentions that the protecting Powers had made certain propoSitions to King Otho relative to his finances, and which have been accepted by His Majesty; that the Powers further required that the :King should change his Ministers and appoint others more disposed towrards the WVestern Governmenbt
and that the Kin,' has consented to that arrange. ment, but on condYtion that the foreig troops shall frst evacuate the Pirmus.
The following private telegraphic despatch has been received;-

"The Mersey has arrived from Constantinople, with the mails of the 29th ult.
"A. despatch from Vienna has been addressed to the Otto. -- Porte, aunouncing that Moldavia and WaUachia will be evacuated by the Anstrian troops before the 24th March. The Turkish troops are not to cross the Danube before the departure of the Austrians.
" The union of the Principalities gains ground: it wiiU be approved by the majority of the Moldo-Wallachian Divans. The Ottoman Porte at present confines itself to the rejection of thte nomiLation of a foreign Prince to govern the united provinces. The Porte is about to take possession of the delta formed by the mouths of the Danube. The Porte, considering as illegal the sentence of exile pronounced by the Hospodars, permits the exiled to return to the MoldoWallchian territory, their country.
"The brother of the Khan of Khiva has offered his allMce to the Shah of Persia.

A letter from the China Seas, dated the 16th of December, and published in the Mon iteur de la Flotte, gives some nevr details relative to the late affair at Canton, showing that the damage sustained by the foreign merchants was not so great as had been stated in the first accounts. It appears that of ]3 blocks, of which Chy-San-Hang, the residence of the Europeans, is composed, five have been destroyed. It was said that of the 80 foreign factories and stores which existed at Canton, only nine, including the British Consulate, escaped the conflagration; this, it states, is an error. Of the 80 establishments, 21 have been burnt down. This is a considerable loss, no doubt,zbut it is much less than that reported. It appears that there existed at Canton a floating population of from 25,000 to 30,000 thieves and vagabonds-refugees from all parts of China. a soon as the English ships commenced their fire these men, taking advantage of the general alarm, rushed in largo bodies into the Chy-San-Hang, and having first pillaged the European stores set fire to them. The British Admiral, seeing what was going forward, brought two of his ships to bear on the pillagers and sent some shells among them, which caused them to fly. Unfortunately the shells from the British ships increased the fire lighted by the vagabonds. The captain of the French frigate Virginie sent a detachment of 150 men on shore, with four light howitzers, to complete the discomfiture of the piLlagers, who fled in every direction, leaving a number of their dead in the streets. The French seamen w. ore labouring indefatigably in extinguishing the fire, which they in a great measure accomplished. As to the Chinese town, it suffered horribly, as well by the fire of the English ships as by the native robbers. Of the 12 great factories belonging to the Hong merchants, and which were situate near the Tartar town, nine were destroyed in the first attack. The English merchants interested in those establishments suffered considerably by that disaster. At the latest dates the British Admiral, having occupied the Chinese military positions, had no more opposition to expect, but a new irruption of the thieves and vagabonds was apprehended. A great number of merchants had emigrated to Shanghai, but the 500,000 inhabitants of Canton cannot go easily dispose of themselves.
A communication from Cochin China mentions, among other interesting facts, that in the month of September last the captain of the French corvette Catinat presented a. letter to te Cochin Chinese authorities at Touranne. Tbe Mandarins of Touranne, as well as those of HIu?, the capital, not only refused to receive the communication, but replied with insolence. They cast the letter into the sea with an expression of contempt. The batteries of Touranne were manned, and preparations were made to attack the Catinat. The captain of the corvette thought it better to anticipate the barbarians. He landed some marines and seamen, who, with one shot from a howitzer, burst open the principal gate. They then spiked the cannon, wetted the gunpowder, and returned quietly on board without noticing the musketshots fired at them. The French spiked 60 brass guns manufactured in the country. The Cochin Chinese authorities were completely awed by the vigour displayed by the French commander. The Mandarins came on board the Catinat, and offered the most humble apologies, and demanded pardon of the great Emperor of the French. The Capricieuse, in the meantime, arrived to the aid of the Catinat, and the letter so contemptuously refused was accepted with gratitude, and carried to the capital with great pomp and every mark of respect. Provisions were brought in abundance on board, and the Cochin Chinese expressed their admiration at the punctuality with which they were paid. They were astonished that men so powerful should be so just. The effect produced by this demonstration, in which the French did not lose a man, was excellent.
The Grand Duke Michael of Russia arrived at Turin on the 5th instant. The Duke was to leave the following day for Genoa, whence he would return to Russia.
A letter from Rome, of the 30th ult., announces the appointment of Prince Orsini to the rank of Senatore (first magistrate of Rome). The pension attached to the office is 10,000 Roman crowns. The place was offered and refused by every Roman Prince in consequence of the Government having stripped the office of all its functions, and reduced the Senatore to figure during the Car2nival in his rich uniform as an amusement for the people.
General Chesney, who arrived at Marseilles by one of the last boats from Constantinople, had an audience of the Emperor Napoleon on Friday. The conversation turned principally onthe Euphrates Railway. General Chesney has since left for London.
A subject is now before the Council of State relative to capitulations accepted by general officers in command before the enemy. The question is, whether there are any and what circumstances in which a general can accept such capitulations, or whether he ought not to hold out to the last? General Niel adopted the affirmative, and supported his views with, it is said, an eloquence that took every one by surprise, and which reminded the hearers of General Foy.
AUSTRIA.
(FROM OUlR OWN CORRESPONDENT.)
VENNA, FEB. 5.
The clemency of the Emperor to the inhabitants of the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom has produced a less favourable impression in this part of the Austrian empire than might have been expected. The Roman Catholic hierarchy and some of the most influential
Austrian generals aver that a general amnesty is neither more nor less than " an encouragement to revolution," and the German and Hungarian races are dissatisfied that so little has been done for them and so much for the Italians. The Germans, Bohemians, and Hungarians affirm that if the Emperor were to show but half as much kindness and condescension to them as he has recently done to his Italian aubiects he would never again have reason to omoplam of their political conduct, and in
allProbability they speak neither more nor 1ess - than -the truth. In 1848 the Italians openly declared that their object was to shake off the yobke of Austria, but when the revolution first began in Hungary nothing more was required of the nentral Government than that it should respect rights and privileges guaranteed to the peoplo by the constitution of the kingdom. As the e-
Emperor Ferdinand readily granted what was demanded of him, the Hungarians were for a time on
erfectly legal ground,but, unfortuately, the ultra-
goeupper murdered Cout
adical party gt thepe hand, mrere Cunt
Lamnberg (the Imperial Comniay) in the streets of Peath, and invested M. ICtosuth with dictatorial poWers. My object in thus recapitulating is to showv that the Italians were in reality greater offBenders
tgainst-the -Austrian dynasty than the gari
The former were froim the very first moment resolved to separate thenselves by main force from the empire, but the Hungarians were not guilty of "' Use-nuajer" until they had become thoroughly confused by the ordinances of the Emperor Ferdinand on the one side, and by the evil counsels of Eossuth on the other. The Hungarian regiments which were in Hungary at the beginnirg of the revolution were ordered by the ex-Emperor to obey for, the future the Hungarian Ministry. When the war commenced the regiments in question were ordered to defend their native country against the Croats under Jellachich, but they had sworn fidelity to the Austrian flag, and were therefore disinclined to draw their swords against troops serving under it. "We addressed ourselves privatelytothe Ban, and implored him to show us the powers which enabled him to act as the legal representative of the Emperor, as we should then know how to act, but he had not been furnished with any. We entreated him to give us his word of honour that he had been ordered by His Yajesty to lead the Imperial troops against Hungary, but he was unable to do so, and we had therefore no choice but to obey the instructions of the Eungarian Government. We did so, and at the end oftlhe war all the officers of the Austrian Hungarian regiments who had not sought safety in flight were tried for high treason and punished accordingly." It cannot be doubted that many of the Hungarian officers who are now in foreign lands would, if questioned on the subject, tell a tale very like the foregoing, and it would therefore be but common justice to give them an opportunity of speedily returning to theirhomesand famdlies. As for the inhabitants of Austria and Bohemia, they have almost forgotten the revolution, and would probablybe entirelyobliviousofthepast if there were not still gaps in many family circles. Prince Esterhazy and three other noblemen have already gone to Hungary to make preparations for the Imperial visit, and it Is morally certain that their Majesties will be most enthusiastically received by the Hungarians, if they are as kindly treated as the Italians have been. The amnesty for Hungary will probably be granted in the month of May, but it is not known when a full pardon is to be given to the political offenders who are natives of the other Austrian provinces.
A person who has just arrived from Milan has given me an account of what occurred in front of the Palace in the evening of the 25th. At 4 o'clock the placards announcing the amnesty were posted, and an hour later 8,000 or 10,000 persons were assembledonthe great square before the Imperial residence, As it was known that their Majesties were at dinner, the people for a time remained comparatively quiet, but towards 6 o'clock the cry of "'Bviva," was so tremendously loud and long that the Emperor had no choice but to walk on to the balcony. After His Majesty had three several times appeared the people called loudly for the Empress, but a message was sent down that she was not very wel. Instead of obstinately insisting on seeing Her Majesty, the gaUant Italians speedily changed their cry to " Long life to the Empress." On the 30th of January Count and Countess Litta, the Marquis Raimondi, and Count Camazzi, who have just returned from Sardinia, dined with their Mlajesties. It is believed that the Archduke Ferdinand Max wiiU on the 12th take the oaths at the hands of his brother, the Emperor, as Governor of the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom. The Archduke will retain his title of Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. At a late hour yesterday evening no official information had been received relative to the departure of their Majesties from Milan.
Before His Majesty went to Italy the King of Naples was strongly urged by this Government to make some concessions to popular opinion, "as the Emperor was about to grant a general amnesty to the political offenders in the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom." There is reason to believe that the ungracious Neapolitan did not even thank- the Austrians for their wellmeant counsel. A private letter from Ferrara gives the following account of the cause of the illness of M. Viale Prel),, the Cardinal Archbishop of Bologna. His Eminence a few days 'ago] addressed an open letter to the clergy of his see, ordering them to introduce stricter church discipline among their parishioners. On the day after the publication of his letter the Archbishop, when driving in his carriage, was grossly insulted by the Bolognese. The behaviour of the mob produced such a painful impression on the prelate that he feU ill, and took to his bed. The Holy Inquisition at Rome has prohibited and condemned the pastoral instructions of the Archbishop of Utrecht and of the Bishops of Haarlem and Deventer relative to the dogma of the Immaculate Conception. It need hardly be said that the three prelates in question, who are designated "Jansenists," are opponents of the new dogma. Among the persons recently amnestied at Naples was a monk named Angelo di Tito, who made revelations which led to the discovery of a conspiracy, which hadramifications in Calabria. It is said that the Russian Minister, M. Kokoschin, counselled the King of Naples to make the concessions required of him, but that His Majesty declined to accept the advice.
The Credit Bank has at length resolved to establish branch banks at Pesth, Lemberg, Prague, and Brumn, but some little time is likely to elapse before its good resolutions are put into execution. The public has no confidence either in the energy or judgment of the Board, and the natural consequence is that Credit Bank shares have ceased to be in favour. Government stock continues to rise steadily.
Some time ago the Austrian papers stated that a Hungarian bishop had been grossly insulted by two Austrian officers, and, to make the tale the more complete, the public was assured the offenders had been cashiered. The truth of the matter is that on the 27th of September last two officers had a quarrel with a Hungarian student of theology in the Victoria Hotel, at Pesth. As no violence was used by either party the difference between the men of the sword and the man of the gown would never have been known to the Viennese public if the authorities had not resolved to find out what had led to the report of a bishop having been insulted.
FEBRuARY 6.
The article in the Moniteur of the 4th relative to the futiure organization of the Danubian Principalities has produced a very unpleasant impression here. In article 24 of the Treaty of the 30th of March it is said-" The Divans ad hGo shall express the wishes of the inhabitants of the Principalities in respect to the definitive organization of the Principalities," and two months before those representative bodies can be convoked the French Cabinet publicly annonnces its desire that Moldavia and Wallachia should be united. It is notorious that this Govermnent has its own private reasons for wishing that the two Principalities should remain separate, but it appears to me that the interests of Europe and those of Austria are in this matter the same. Austrian statesmen maintain that if the two PrinciDalities are united the tie which unites them to the Turkish empire will exist merely in namne. It is argued that the new Rouman state, which would be governed by a few more or less venal ABoyards and Greek priests, would soon be as much "unnder the thumb " of Russia as. the kingdom of Greece is, and would besides be the
niucleus or that empire which the Russians have sO long wished to form out of those Christian provinces that now figure on the map as Turkey in Europe. It would be premature to express an opinion on a subject which wil not be before the public for some time to come, but it may be as well to state a fact which came to my knowledge a short time ago. At the beginninc of the war, when the Russian army was in Little Wallachia, aplanhadbeen formed for revolutionizing
Bulgaria, Servia, Montenegro, and all the other Turkish provinces in Europe, in which the Christian population is in a majority, and nothing prevented the realization of this hopeful plan but the gallantry of the Turks at 1alafat, and the menacing attitude of Austria in the Servian Banat. M. de Bourqueney, who professes to be astonished that the policy of Austria should differ from that of France in the matter of thePriuncipalities, speaks of "the preponderance of his Government" in a way which can hardly be to the taste of this Cabinet. It cannot, however, be denied that the great majority of the Moldavians and Wallachians are favourable to the union, and the Austrian writers are certainly in error when they assert that the only persons who wish to see the provinces united are the Boyards, who are now intriguing and eancan-dancing in the French capitaL The PFenna Presse of this
morninlg observes, that the recent policy of Frane on the LEastern q,ue8tion cannot excite
astonishment, if it is considered that Count de Morny is to pass the whole winter at St. Petersburg,
and the Grand Duke Constantine to visit the Em-
XPeror Napoleon in{the _pring. The most remarkable passage in the article in question i5 the follow2ng:-
" The mask has now been 1ai4 aside, and the question of the Principalities is to be mrde an affair of the highest inportance. The declaration of the AMoniteur will givs frsh vigour and courage to Russia, for thlenion of tie Danubian Prncipalities will be the first great step towards the break. ing up of Turkey,-it will be a positive encroachment on the sovereigu rights of the Sultan, and an act of hostility to wards the Powers which closed up the land and sea routes from Russia to Constantinople."

PRUSSIA.
(FROM OUPl OWN COMaUPOXD7X1,.)
BERLIN, Fm. 7.
Since the Sound Dues Conferences were held at Copenhagen in February, then comprising England, Prussia, Russia, Sweden, France, &c., various other Powers have been admitted as members of it, among them Austria, Belgium, and Spain. Austria has fully coincided in all the provisions already agreed to by the original members of the Conference, but with Spain and Belgium matters do not go on so amoothly. Spain finds nothing to object to in the terms proposed and agreed to by the others, but cannot see her way to paying her quota in any imagina3ble manner. Belginm, again, is striving to get a set-ofmade in her favour, in consideration of the remission of the Scheldt Dues, whEich she extends to all vessels that come up to Antwerp; but to this attempt Denmark replies, that if Belgium found it worth her while to introduce this arrangement without reference to the Sound Dues, she will also probably find it worth her while to continue it so; and that if once the principle of sets-off is adopted and entered upon there will be no hope of bringing a treaty to an end within the lapse of many years.
The long continued stay of the Swedish Admiral Virgin at Copenhagen as Minister Extraordinary from Sweden is interpreted by the Aftonbladeit (Stockholm paper) to have for its object to procure the consent of Denmark to an alteration in the London Protocol of 1852 which settled the succession to the Danish throne. This alone, as the Aftonbladet affirms, can ward off the danger of a Russian supremacy',over theStatesof theBaltic. Itispresumed that the Admiral will proceed from Copenhagen to London as soon as he has made some amount of progress with his mission. While the AftonUadet dwells on the danger to the Scandinavian States from their common enemy Russia, and recommends their drawing closer and closer together for mutual strength and assistance, it points out, at the same time, the necessity of Denmark's freeing herself from her connexion with her German Duchies, whose foreign nationality and fealty will never cease to be a source of weakness and distraction to her.
Great exertions are being made just now to get a Professorship of the Slavonian languages founded at the University of Copenhagen.
As I have taken several occasions of late to draw your attention to the conviction that is constantly gaining ground in the north of Europe ax to the necessity of altering the provisions of the London Protocol of 1852 with reference to the succession to the Danish throne, to the necessity of separating the German Duchies from Denmark, and to the desirableness of a Scandinavian iunion between Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, I must guard against the efects of a prejudice I know to exist in England on this subject, and which will inevitably be aroused by my writing to you upon it from the capital of Prussia, viz. :-the idea that Prussia is agitating for* the separation of the Duchies from Denmark for the sake of obtaining them for herself. To meet this prejudice I will inform you that there is as yet no agitation of the kind going on in the Prussian or German press
that the conviction is a Scandinavian product, but is heartily concurred in by the German Duchies; that the GermLan Powers in their negotiations with Denmark with reference to the present conflict are moving solely on the basis of the peace of 1862, which recognizes the German Duchies as an integral part of the Danish monarchy; that in the course of scores of conversations I have had with Prussian politicians on the subject of the oppression inflicted by Denmark on the German duchies I have never heard of any intention or aspiration on the part of Prussia to obtain those terr.- tories for herself; further, I would mention thit Holstein and Lauenburg are fully as strong, rich, and capable of defending themselves an many other members of the German Confederation; and, if united with Hamburg, Altona, and Lubeck, might form a most important, wealthy, and thriving Federal Republic without any alteration in the present extent of the German Confederation; and, finally, that the territory so separated from Denmark will be so strong as not to require to put itself under the protection of any other State, nor become a member of the German Zollverein. A Federal Republic composed of the three free ports, Hamburg, Altona, and Lubeck, with the second harbour in the world (Kiel) and the fruitful soil of Holstein, and placed on the isthmus that separates the North Sea from the Baltic, would have a destiny second to that of no commercial republic that ever existed.

THx "SECETB T'EATY."-Tho pretended wecret treaty by whichthe Western Powers were serted to have guaranteed to Austria her Italian provinces is a last years fable revivedl by Mr. Disraeli to adorn hlis speech with some oratorical effects; but it is only a fable. The truth is that in conformity with its policy of peace and moderation France informed Austria, during the war, that it Was not her intention to seek-to- make-conquests in any part of Europe, and that consequently France Would not dturb Austria in her Italianpossessions. But this seems to us a widely different thing from the Ian e attributed to tte E mp.eror's Government by Mr. DisraeL.

Money-Market and City Intelligence.
. M02MY-MABK-L?TandOITYIVT.KLLIGEVC.M.
Monday Evening.
The English funds opened this morning at a reco-
very of an eighth, and remained without flactuation throughoutt the day. Consols were quoted 921 to 93 for money, and 93 to I for the 6th of March. The announcement of the gold arrivals had no other effect than that of giving steadiness to the market, which was otherwise liable to show weakness from the gradual closing of accounts by some of the recent speculative purchasers. Money on Government securities was in fair supply at 6 per cent. Bank Stock left off at 216 to 218; Reduced, 931 to
New Three per Cents., 931 to i- India Stock, 218 to 220; Exchequer-bonds, 984 to a; Indiabonds, 2s. discount to Is. premium; and Exchequer-bils, par to 3s. premium.
In the discount-market and at the Bank of England to-day there was increased activity, owing to a temporary demand for money to pay for the gold purchased for France.
Foreign securities have been steady, but the transaCtions were not important. Turkish Six per Cents. for money were negotiated at 93k ; for the account 93g and ; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed for money, at 100l and for the account at 100k. The general operations comprised-Buenos Ayres, for account, Sf4; Portuguese Three per Cents., for account, 44; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 96i ; Sardinin Five per Cents., for account, 90; Spanish Three per Centsa, for account, 40; the New; Deferred, for money, 24;* for the account, 234; Spanish Certilicates, 60 and i- and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 98j.
The corn-market was extremely dull this morning, and only the beat descriptions could be sold at previous prices.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 68f. lOc. for money, and 68f. 45c. for the end of the month, showing a further recovery of j per cent. in consequence of speculative purchases.
The continental exchanges continue with a favourable aDpearance. At Hamburg the rate of discount has declined to 31 per cent.
A further suTm of 10,0001. in gold was taken from the Bank to-day.
The total of gold from Australia by the Morning idght and Heather Bell is 822,0001. Of this the 326,0001. brought by the Heather Bell has already been delivered in London and sold for exportation, chiefly to the Bank of France. The total that will be purchased on behalf of that establishment will amount, it is thought, to a little more than half of the entire arrival. At the same time there are other purchasers in the market, the demand being kept up to pay for large amounts of silver which still continue to be sent to this country, although the operation at present prices would appearto involve aloss. Under these circumstances it is scarcely probable that much more than a fourth of the present supply will be taken to the Bank of England, and some persons doubt if the proportion willbeoso great. It has come opportunely for the Bank of France, so as to influence the fresh monthly return about to be published.
The Centurion has arrived from Sydney with 5,400 ounces of gold, valued at 21,6001.
The advices by the Morning Light, from Melbourne, reach to the 14th of November, and are a fortnight later than those previously received. With the return of summer the production of gold was again becoming large, but although the miners were prosperous the prices of imported goods were effectually kept down by the arrivals from England, which promised to be much beyond the general wants of the colony. The stocks of provisions were heavy, and quotations in most cases were faUing. According to a circular of Messrs. Miles, Kington, and Co., the wool season has opened with much firmness. At the first sales of the new clip the attendance waslarge and an advance of Id. to lid. per lb. was realized on last season's rates, buyers being anxious to ship in time for the London February sales. The next departures were to be the Blackwall on the 25th of November, the Mermaid on the 30th, and the Admiral on the 2d of December. Each of these vessels may be expected to bring a considerable amount of gold.
The accounts from Sydney state that the halfyearly meeting of the Bank of New South Wales had beenheldon the 29th of October. The profits for the six months amounted to 64,683., and a dividend was declared at the rate of 20 per cent. per annum. The reserve fund, which received an addition of 13,6221., now stands at 125,0001., and a balance of 3,0631. was carried forward. New branches have been established at Albury, Bathurst, Mudgee, and Tamworth, as wel as an agency at the goldfield on Rocky River.
Advices from Vienna state that the stock of bulion in the Austrian Bank has reached 8,909,0001., showing an augmentation of 185,0001. during the month of January. Meanwhile a contraction of 525,0001. has been effected in the note circulation, which now stands at 37,493,8131. Steady progress is thus being made towards a position in which a resumption of specie payments may be ventured upon, but several months will stiU probably elapse before the specie in hand wil amount to the safe proportion of one-third of the paper issues. Within the last half-year the bullion absorbed by the Austrian Bank from France aud other countries has been equal to nearly 5,000,0001.
The general reports from the manufacturing towns throughout the kingdom continue to show a steady trade, but on the average there has been less animation during the past week than for some time previously. At Manchester the demand has been dull, and lower rates have been accepted, the state of the Liverpool cotton-market still inducing great caution. The Birmingham report describes no alteration in iron. The tone, however, is rather less firm. At Nottingham there has been an unusually large business in lace, and the transactions in hosiery have likewise been satisfactory. In the woollen districts prices are wel maintained, and employment has been general, although scarcely so active as during the preceding week or two.
At a meeting of Venezuelan Bondholders, held today, Mr. J. D. Powvles,in the chair, the modified terms for the arrangement of the debt of that republic, as described in The Times of the 29th of January, were agreed to. In the course of the discussion it was explained that the committee with an influential section of their constituents, including foreign bankers and members of the Stock Exchange, had, after interviews with the commissioners, reconsidered the question and been enabled to obtain a settlement which they trust will prove definitive. Strong opinions were expressed by several of the speakers on the proposed surrender of the bonds; but it was mentioned that the arrangement now contemplated includes provisions that will, if possible, afford greater security to the bondholders. Under the terms, in which it is suggested the appropriation of one-fourth of the cu,tomrs revenue sab be carried out, there will, it is urged, be good ground to appeal for Government intervention, should the authorities at Caraccas violate the arrangement. The following resolution havimg been sanctioned by a large maority, it was, announced that, as it wil be requisite for the agreement to, be ratified by Congress before the convers;on can be effected, one of the committee will proceed to Venezuela to facilitate, if possible, the progress of the necessary measures.
"-That the agreement concluded between Senor Modesto Urbaneia and Tenor Juan Giuseppi, commissioners from I the republic of Venezuela, and the Committee of SpanishAmerican Bondholders, dated the 30th day of January last, for the adjustment of the foreign debt of tho said republic,
be approved by this meeting; and that the committee be
request to take measures for carzying the same into effect."
At a meeting of the Australian Royal Mail Company this afternoon the proposal of the directors to apply for a supplemental charter was confirmed, but they are not to take any measures for further operations without previously consulting the shareholder3.
Since the last meeting four of the vessels have been discharged from the transport service,-viz., the Sydney, the Adelaide, the Victoria, and the Australian, and have been placed in the Victoria Dock, waiting purchasers. The arrugement of accounts with the Government is proceeding slowly.
The departures from the port of London for the Australian colonies during tho past week have comprised three vessels-two to Port Philip and one to H Hobart Town, with an aggregate capacity of 1,402 toni. The rates of freight continue to exhibit heavinmess.
The Agra, from Shangh,i is reported off the Western Islands with a Tlnabl cargo of 2,389 bales of silk and 517,5001b. of teK The Virginia has also arrived from Foo-chow-Foo with a quantity of
tea.
The Coral Queen, from the Cape of Good Hope,
ihrriveA ' in the river, IhavmglthWoii the 22d of December. The Scotland bad arrived out.
The Peninsular. and Oriental steamer Aden, with advices fromBombay to the 17th of January, arrived at Suez on the 28th. There is nothing further of importance from the Persian Gulf. General Outram and staff left Bombay in the Semiramis on the 16th of January. The troops at Bushire were roported healthy.
It appears that the Heather Bell reached Deal on Saturday, and the whole of her letters were delivered this m orning. The Morning Light arrived at Liverpool on Sunday with the mail of the latest date, but at is thought some of the letters have not yet reached their destination.
At copy bas been received of a correspondence betweenMr. Luardand the London and County Bank, of which he was lately the manager. Mr. Luard complained of the tone of a circular issued by the bank ii Aprillast, and the bank, in a letter dlated the 4th inst., have replied that it was not the intention of the board to impeach his integrity.
The amount paid into the Treasury of the East India-house for bills on- India from the 25th of January to the 9th inst., was 123,1981.

For late delivery, however, there is less disposition to operate, and the price for April to June has be-en barely supported, 57s. being accepted for the last three months.'

wsple ere- moderite, especiany of foreii wheat. The exports were 3,5OO-quarters of wheat, 54
quarters of rye, 862 quarters of sinio, and 2,04sac of four.
Of foreign wheat there were only 630 quarters; of English, 5,712 quarters. The samples this morning from Krent and Essex wero but few, vith the condition prtiasIly improved. Tho few fine samples that appeared old elowl at previous rates, inferior being quite neglected. Thera was an Improved trade in foreiga for consumption, at un. altered prices.
Thereceipts of country flour were 15,434 sacks, with only 161 sacls from abroad. Norfolk, though Is. per sack lower, were more firmly held. Town-made were reduced 3g. per sacir, the top quotation being 57s. Tho A merican rates were unchanged.
There wore 2,053 quarters of English barley and 4,650 foreign, with onlv a moderate sprinkling of home-grown for the morning. Though the finest malting descriptions main. tained their value, all below them were ls. lower and a very slow sale.
Of oats there were 11,112 quarters of foreign, 8,605 quarters of Irish, 1,210 quarters of Scotch, and 2,osM quaters of English. The best old corn sold at former rates, but all inferior parcels of every description were 6d. per quarter cheaper.
Of peas there were only 361 quarters of English, which sold heavily at former prices.
Of beans, 620 quarters of foreign and 1,040 quarters of home-grown. New English, beans were very difficult to quit, ana rather cheaper.
There wero no arrvals of linseed, with exportb'iM quarters. The market was again dearer Is. to 2s. per quarter for crushing seed, and firm for cakes.
Bed cloverseod was in fair inquiry, as well as trewthe former at a further improvement of lg. per owt. jAite in rmoderate demand, at rather more money. Canary and hempmeed were dull, and, with other descriptions of seeds. remained as last quoted.

RAILWAY ?TBLLIGGEMTICR. CORK ANY TRAXA1nT rn
The report of the directors of this company states that they have applied themselves to the tack of liquidati339 the debts of the company, the greater paut of which have now been disoharged, ard the two outstanding calls on the preference shares No. 2, -which will fall due on the Ist of fav and the 1st of November next respectively, will be appled to the payment of the other liabilites. The directors regret that they are not able to report a larger increase than 2201. in tho traffic receipts of the last six months as compared with the corresponding period of 3855. The working expenses averaged 5f0 per cent. of the gross receipts. An extra expenditure was found requisite for the renewal of sleepers and putting the permanent way and works in their present efficient condition, as well as for the more perfect repair and renewal of the locomotive and coaching stock. The several outstanding accounts of the previous year have been paid, and charged in the accounts of the half-year just ended. The accounts, after providing for all workingoexensss interest, and yment of all dividends her el ct of teh No. I preference shares, show a disposable balance of 1,6731., out of which the directors recommend a dividend at the rate of 4 r cent. er annum for th-o half-year ending the 31st of lcember rst on the No. 1 preference shares, and that irterest at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum for the same period be paid on the No. 2 preference capital paid up to December last, leaving a small balance. At a large and influential meeting of landoaners and others interested in the extension of the railway to Bantry and Skibbereen, held at Dunmanway in October last, at which a deputation of the directors attended, resolutions were passed in favour of a county guarantee of 5 per cent. being granted upon an expenditure of 6,0001. per mile for constructing the extension line of railway. The directors have accordingly lodged a bill this season with a view to carryig out that extension. The capital account showed that 344,5581. had been receited, including 3,9471. loans from revenue, and 344,5301. expended, including 1,3941. repaid to revenue, leavinga balince of 1,0271. The revenue account showed that 6,%781. had been received during tho half-year, and 3,7481. expended, leaving a balance of 2,830., to which was added 4,406h from the last account, making 7,2361. Out of this was deducted 1,9321. for dividends on the No. 1 preference shares, 8141. interest on debenture det, and 1,3711. arrears of interest paid off, leaving a balance of 3,1181. at the banker's, to which was added 1,1141. for stores and materials, making 4,232& The outstanding accounts due to sundry creditors and interest due on debentare debt amount to 2,1551., first dividend unpaid on No. 1 preference shares to 181., on second dividend to 2861., and on third dividend to 99 total, 2,2571.; leaving a balance of 1,6731.
ANTWERP AND ROTTERDAX.
Messrs. S. Laing and L. Schuster, chairman and deputychairman of this compahy, state that, owing to complicated difficulties in forming a now board, the reorganisation of the management has been deferred until the ordina
genoral neeting in May next, when the present directors will definitively resign. In the meantime the Belgian. board have, at their request, elected a new English director, CaptainW. M. Shaw, and have pledged themselves to do nothing of importance until May ithout consulting their English colleagues.
The result of Captain Shaw's visit toBelgium for the pur. pose of investigating the actual position of the company at the end of the year is embodied in a report. It states that he (Captain Shaw) having been elected a director, a board cannot now be held in Belgium without the presence of an English director. The managinz director has formally agreed that the suggestions of the English directors shall be
aied out, and the whole body areto place their resignations before the meeting to be held in May. The accounts are kept in great detail, and precisely upon the system adopted on the State lines, the payments are made by checks upon the bankers, and vouchers taken for all payments made. There are five oommissaires-two of whom are appointed bythe Government, and who have powers quite independent of the directors to examine the accounts, which must be submitted to them a month previous to the general meeting. The permanent way Is kept in very good order. There are no ress than 168 level crossings, kept by 71 women and 32 men, at an expense to the company of 1,2001. a-year. All the works on the line are considered finished, with the exception of Moerdyke, which is so far advanced that it might be completed by the end of February, at arn outlay of l,OOOI.
provided all had been wid up to the end of 1856. On the work being completed the capital account will be closed. The expenditure will stand at 587,0001.; this and a deficiency of 4,0001., occasioned by that amount of the bond capital not having been taken up at the original issae, have been met partly by advances made by Mr. Matthien to the amount of 7,0001., and partlyby borrowing from rovenaue accounts the profits of the year's working ; and the actual position of the company at the close of the year would be nearly 13,0001. in assots, and 19,2501. liabilitiee. The capital expended during the past year amounted to 25,185.l The exes of about 7,000W. on a capital of 580,0001. being now known, the Bhareholders can look it in the face, and decide how to deal with it. It can only be met by creating fresh capital to that amount, or by foregoing the dividend which has been earned for the past year, and thus enable the company t start square for the year 1857. The revenue account for the year 1856 amounted to 40,6001.; the rent of the Lierre and Turnhout to 8001.; the working expenses of the railway to 21,800b.; anid of the steamners to 6 1001. - these expense makce together 28,7001., leaving 61. as the profit on tne yearTs worldng, out of which has been paid 3,8001. interest on bonds, leavingsa surplus, which has been loaned to capitaL Comparing the expenses of the past year with those of the preceding year, they do not appear to have increased. Captain Shaw stated that he tbinks it does not reguire any extraordinary exertion to bring traffic on the le sufficient to increase the receipts by t least 10 par cent, for the year 1857, and. by making a reduc - tion in the number of employ6r, and if possible selling the new steamer, and adopting a few fiat-bottomed boats with a nrewller to to them, for the heavy goods traffic, at least O per cent will be saved in working expenses This saving of 10 per cent. on the one hand, and 10 per cent, increase of traffic on the other, would leave an available dividend to the shareholders of about 3 per cent. He states that thereocan be no doubt, however, that thep resent traffic is unaccountably small, considerin the ,prution and resources of the kingdem of Hollan

False Characters To Servants.
FALSE CHABACTERS TO SERyVATS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I am a butler, and am proud to say have been 25 years in my present service come next September
dunng which time you may deiend I have had all sorts of fellow-servants-good, bad, an indifferent.
It may, I dare to say, astonish you to hear that I, a servant, have read with great satisfaction indeed a letter in The Times of to-day on the subject of false characters to servants, togetber with a recommendation that masters should combine together to form a society to protect them. selves against bad servants.
Sir, I know that every word your correspondent says is true not only in London, but in the country likewise, and can tell jon what perhaps you don't know-that the misery occasioned to masters hy Dad servants is as nothing to what their respectable fellow-servants have to go through; and very sure ain I that all realy_good ones wil e only too glad to see such a society over all England, as then they will stand a cbance of some peace and quietness, instead of as now, having a parcel of thieves, and drunkards, and others as shaU bel nameless brought into the house by meas of false characters, and for whose misdeeds they have often to suffer. But Sir, unless you take up the matter I sball never live to see the day, for masters won't take the trouble to protect themselves. The only cbance I see for it is for some one to set up a comnany and invite, masters and servants to support them, and i youvd only undertake to advise this I mn sure it would pay well, as every respectable servant in England would joLuit gldly. As for masters doing anything to help themselves, you ma be sure they won't. They would rather endure the evil
but I have no sort of doubt they -would subscribe a geinea or two every year, as it would save them a world of what they so much dislike-trouble. There is one thing the writer of the letter in The Times does not take notice or, and that is, that the very worst servants often get places wvithout characters at a&l. I will tell you what I have seen myself. Within the last ten years we have had three very bad servants in our house, who were turned off, and rightly too, at a moment's notice, for drunkenness and thieving. Master was never asked to give them a character, but two of them, who were both good cooks, got places within five miles of this house, by going to tradesmen who knew nothing of them, and askimg to be recommended. They then to d a lie, and said that the last family they hved with was gone abroad, but nevertheless they got their places, and this sort of thimg happens every day.
Now, Sir, when masters will take servants like this, how can they be expected to hold up their hands to help themEelves out of the difficulty that gets worse and worse every day? They won't do it. Therefore, Sir, do you, who have corrected so much that is wrong, see if you can't set this to rihts, and very sue am I that you will receive the best thanss of every respectable xervajnt, as well as of the
I could write a good deal more on this subject.

flese were appeals from the A-rches Court of Oanterbury in the cases of St. pauptsla' St. Barnabag, Knightsbridge. The facts have so repeateady been laid before the public that it is unnecessary to enter into details. It is sufficient to state that the suits originated in the Consistory Court of London. With regard to St. Paul's the proceedings were institntedby Mr. Westerton, one of tho churchwardens who prayed a faculty for the removal from the chancel of the altar, orhighaltar,orpieceof church furniturewhereon to celebrate the Holy Communion, with the cross elevated thereon and attached thereto, as also for the removal of the gilded candlesticha, and the candles therein, the credentipreparatorT altar, or credence-table, and also of the several divers coloured altar coverings, and instead of the altar to direct that there be provided a convenient and decent table for the celebration of the Holy Communion, and a decent cloth for the covering thereof, as by the laws, canons, constitutions, and customs of the united church of England and Ireland was prescribeid In the case of St. Barnabas Mr. Beal applied for a monition to Mr. LiddeU and the chapelwardens to remove the rood screen and brazen gates, together with the cross elevated and fixed on the screen, and also the stonie altar and cloths now used for covering the ame, and the cross ornamented with jewels elevated thereon and fixed thereto, with the candlesticks and candles placed thereon, and also the marble credentia or credence-table, and to substitete in lien thereof a 'decent table for the administration of the Holy Communion and a decent covering thereto, and to set utp st Ahe east end of the chancel the Ten Commandments. The learned judge of that court, Dr. Lushington after stating that the table in St. Paul's being made ci wood, though highly carved and not of stone, he did not feel bound to direct its removal, and that he held tlhat all lighted candles on the commanion table were eontrary to law, except when they were lighted for the purpose of gving neceary light, made the following decree, that as to St. Paul's a faculty Lssue to remove the credence table and the cross on or near to the communion table; to take away all cloths at present used in the church for covering the communion table during divine service, and to subatitute one only covering for such purpose of silk or other decent staff. With respect to St. Barnabas he directed a monition to issue to remove the present structure of stone used as a communion table and to substitute a moveable table of wood; to remove tZe credence table, the cross on the chancel screen, and that on or near the present structure used as a communion table; to take away all the cloths at present used in the church for covering the communion table during divine service, and to aubstitnte one only covering for such purpose, of silk or other decent stuff; and further, to remove any cover used at the time of the ministration of the Sacrament, worlked or embroidered with lace, or otherwise ornamented, and to substitute a fair white linen cloth, without lace or embroidery or other ornament, and to cause the Ten Commandments to be set up as prayed by Mr. Deal. From this decision appeals were prosecuted to the Arches Court of Canterbury, where Sir John Dodson, after having affirmed theuadgoment of the Court below in all respects, condemned the appellants in the costs of the

It appeared that there was a mutual understanding (though not reduced to writing) between the original shareholders of the companv, tbatuponpayment of ailcalladue and their share of liability for thetime being, nny of the shareholders mightretire,and that the three shareholdersin questionhadavailed theelves of such understanding, with the consent of the committee of managementl in January, 1855. They had not since done ny act to reinstate themselves in a position of liability in respect to the affairs of the mines, and under these circumstances the Court considered they ought not to bo fixed as sontributories.

Mr. LOYD (Mr. Pearson with him) applied for an injunction in this case to restrain the Earl of Dartmouth and others from acting as a local council to a theological society set on foot at Lichfield, in the year 1852, and for restraining the Bishop of Lichfield and others from paying the expenses of defending the election of such council out of the funds of the institation. The application appeared to be based upon some misunderstanding arsing out of the mixed povernment of the institution, and the motion for an in3nction vwas refused, ont the ground that the Court saw no proof of misconduct to justify its interference at p resent, the costs of the application to ho reseved until he heasing of the caulse.

Lu rmis case A mandamu had issued to the overseers of Christ hurch, Spitalfields, commanding them to deliver up to the prosecutor, James Baynton, the ratebooks of the parish. To this writ the overseers made a return, and thus everalissues in fact wern raised, which were afterwards tried before 1ord Campbell at GuildlaalL It was then agreed that all the facts should be stated in the form of a specil case for the opinion of the Court. This had been done, and thus two questions were raised-Ist, whether the prosecutor had been legally removed from his office of 1-or-rate collector * and 2dly, whether the defendants were legally bound to deliver up the books. It appeared that the affairs of the parish of Christ Church were regulated by several local acfs, one of which, the 2d George II., c. 10, constituted a select vestry} which was to consist of a certain number qualified accordimg to the act, and also to include all those 'who had filled the office of churchwarden or overseer. The number of vestrymen was thus indetermi. nate, thoug at the time when the prosecutor was removed from his ouuce the 'restrymen were about 80 in number. It appeared that in the month of September, 1854, some complaints were made of the mode in which the prosecutor discharged his duties, and a meeting of the elect vestry was held to consider his conduct. At that meeting 35 out of the 80 vestrymen attended, and when a motion uwas pt for the prosecutor's removal from his offlce the motion was camried by a majority of 16 to U votes, the other eight vestrymenwho were present abstaining from votin g altgether. ae first question now was whether the prosecutor ~ad been properly re,noved, and this depended on he construction of the 14th section of the 18th
orge , chap. 74, ono of the local acts. That section empd)owered the vestrymen of the parish, the churchwardens, an oversers, "o themajor part of them," to appoint cOL.
letorsos at any meeting to be held h the vesry-oomof heparish;" and the same section gave a siilarpowr todisiss uchcollectors.
Vr. I. HL Q. (with whom was Mr. 31acnazoara), contended, on the part of the prosecutor, that, as this was a slect vest r, it was necessary that a majority of the whole body Of vestry-en should be present and concur in the act to bedone, and he cited the case of " Blackett v Blixzard" (9, B. and C., 851) in support of his argwument.
Kr, Justice cROierTox.That is the case of a definite oY, Here the body is indefmite; for, al those who have "l1ed the OffCe Of churchwad~eu anaDoverseerare to beehers. The number oI members varies every day.
Mrr. HIL contendoed that it made no difference whether the number was fixed or whether a description was given of what should constitute member. Where a trust was re. Posed in a publicbï¿½ody it was a wholesome rule that there shouldI bea majority present.
x r. Justice ERDZ said he knew of no authority for. such a rule. It would render it necessary to inquira. whether a tchurchwanwho had not showu for 20 ew&

cstmbled. it the meeting in qaestion, though there 'were 35 preEert, only 27 voted, 16 being for the removal, and 11 against it. There ought to bave been a mFjority of thosepreEent. The learned counsel then contended that it was elear uapon the case that it was inL the power of the oversers to deliver up the ratebooks.
Mr. Justice ERLB said the question was vhether it was in their legal power to do it.
3Ir. ATHsinToN, for tho defendants, contended that, s the select vestry consisted of an indefinito number, it wa not necessary that the major part should coneur in every act done. That would render it at all times uncertain whether the number present at the vestry 'were competent to act. The learned counsel contended it vwas sufficient if the act was done by the major part of those who were present and took a part in the proceedings. Parties could not by abstaining frons voting render the act of the majority in-
Mr. Justice ERLE.-They have a right to abaicato, andso not take any part in the proceedings.
Mr. Justice CRosrrToN sid it was a question whether the statute did not. mean that there should be a majority of those present.
Mr. AKTHDRTDo said he thought that parties had a right, if they thought proper, to take nopsart, and if they did sO, the act of the majority of those who voted was valid. The act did not say there must bo a majority of those present.c
The argument was not concluded when the Court rose.

THE QUMEE V. JONES AND OTHE.
Mr. Collier was counsel for the prosecution, and Mr. Serleaut Parry and Mr. Robinson for the defendants.
w was an indictment for a forcible entry in some premises situate at 24 and 25, Park-crescent-mews, Regent'spark. These premises were formerly occupied by a Mr. Mtcott, avetermary surgeon, who went to the Crimesa, where he died, leaving a widow, who died shortly afterwards intestate. Sean was made for the next of kin of Scott, bat none could he found. A man named.East had been Scott's foreman, and upon the death of Soott's widow East continued to cay on the business for himslf and the other areditors of Scott. It was arrangea that one Salmon should take out letters of administration to Soott, but, it being found that he had represented the estate to be insolvent, a caveat was entered to prevent his obtaining the administration. On the 2dof August, between7 aud 8 in the evening, the premises in question were locked up. It appared, according to the learned counsel's statement, that Salemon and his attorney, Wiliam Jones, the defendant, had entered into a plot for the purpose of obtaining possession of the premises. They got a number of "roughs," and they maide such an arrangement that they met in the middle of the night at Tsln$e-bar; they proceeded to the premises about 2 or3 o'clock in the morning with crowbars and other implements; they there met Jones and Salmon, and then they broke open the premises by violent means ; and they kept possession, so that when East went the next morninghe was not allowed to enter.
After hearing the case, however, which was of no importance,
Lord C&IpELLB said that the defendants could not be convicted upon the evidence, and therefore directed an

This was an action brought by the laintiff to recover damages from the defendant, the well-nown horsedcaler, for the alleged breach of a wrranty given on the sale of a brown horse, purehased by Mr. Duncan from the defendant for the sum Ot 2o004
It appeared that in July last the plaintiff, who resides in Paris, bought through the medium of a friend, M.r.Edgar, of the frm of Swan and Edgar, from the defendant a pair of fine carriage horses, and paid for them 4001. They were sent over to Boulogne, where, after an excellent passage, they were met by one of Mr. Duncan's grooms, taken to Pais, and after having been duly physicked, were harnessed for tral, The horse in question, a brown one, refused to start, jibbed, reared, puanged, an eventually set off at a great pace, and behaved pretty well during the drive. The same scene occurred whenever a start had to be cffected, and, as it was proved that he had a chronic congh, a curb, and a Pvin, the plaintiff conteuded that the terms of the warranty given when he was bought-viz, " owed and quiet to ride and drive," were not complied with, and tiat he was entitled to recover the difference between the sum which he had paid andthat-which the animal subsequentlyfetched at Tattrsall's-namely, 37& net.
3Mr. Edgar and a great number of other witnesses were called for the plaintiff, but it is not necessary to set out their evidence, for at the conclusion of his Case
Mr. HAWRMS said that his client was satisfied that Mlr. Duncan ought to have his money back that he had defended the action because he had been informed that the horse, for which he had himself given 180, had beaenmismanaged and hardly driven by the lantiff, or his servants, ~pd that none of the faults complaied of existed wben he w as sold. Mr. Etdgarhahd sa^imd tL dha e never examined a hlorse which Mfr.

SPECIAL PAP.
SHAIPE V. GIOBB.
This was a special case in a action to recover certain freight under a charter-party, the question being whether a clause in that instrament, which required that the ship should be despatched within 21 days from her arrival at Sydn el had bee complied with on the part of tho plaintiff. t appeared that after the vessdl arrived at Sydney many ef her crevw deserted, and she was not able to pro. ceed on her homewardvoyage till after the stipulated time; but it also appeared that before that tirme, and while she was not fully manned, the captain had moved her out from her moorings and-made a progress of a short distance, when she came to an anchor. While there the crew mutinied, and compelled the captain to return to Sydney for the purpose of filling up the deficient berths. Under theso circumstances
Mr. QuALS, for the plaintiff, contended that, as the ship had broken ground with the bond jle object of proceeding on the voyage within the stipulated time, the clause was complied with, no matter how short the progress was which was made in the voyaga.
Mr. WILDX, who sppeared for the defendant, was not called on to argue,
The COU1RT being unauimously of opinion that the obligation of the charter-party had not been complied with so as to entitlo the plaintiff to sue for the freight, which was the subject of the present action.
Judgment for the defendant accordingly.

This was an appeal from the Deputy-Judge of the Sheriffs' Court.

Mr. EDWLN Jï¿½axEs, in addressing the' on behalf of the defendant5 contended that he was perecty justified in telling theplantiff'swife that he thought the meat had been changed. The plaitif himself had published the slanders by following the denendast into the public libray and abusiug him. was vrmy hard that a gentleman could not make a com haint to his tradespeople but he must be

If, however, they considered that he had acted maliciously, they must find for the pantiff, lwith such damages as they considered would compensate him for the injuries they considere he had sustained.
The jury retired, and after having been absent for about three-quarters of an hour, they returned, and found a verdict for the defendant, but at the same time expressed a wish that each party should pay their own costs.

Police.
POLICE.
MASSSION-HoUsEs-A gentleman whose name did not transpire complained to Mr. Alderman WILSON (who sat for the Lord hayor) of the interference of the police in what he coneidered to be an unjustifiable manner. He stated that on Saturday evening, being on his way to a dinner party, he stopped in the open space between the Royal Exchange and IExchange-buildings for the purpose of having his boots cleaned, as there were several boys with their brnshes standing there. Just as one or his boots was finshed, however, a policeman caame up, who compelled all the boys to move off, notwithstanding his remonstrances, and, although one of the boys offered to clean the other boot if complainant would go with him down a neighbouring court, the poiiceman would not allow him to do so, and complainant consequently was compelled to go away with one boot cleaned and one dirty, which made him look perfectly ridiculous. There was, he conceived, no grounds for the policeman's interference, as the boys were stationed on an open space where they offered no obstruction to public traffic.
Alderman WiisoN.-Certainly not. Where is the inspector ? Why was this boy sent away?
Inspector Scott.-The boys belonging to the schools are allowed to stand there till 4 o'olook; and of these other boys some turn out to be thieves occasionally, and so we do not allow them to stand.
Alderman WILsoN.-That is just what they and I complain of. These boystrytoearnanhonestpenny, butyouwiU not allowthem to do so, and compel them to become thieves. I do not see vhy they should not be allowed to clean boots in the streets as well as the brigade boys; and, at all events, they might he allowred after 4 'clock, when the brigade bolys ate gone awy. (To complainat)z-Did you take the
Complainaut.-No, I did not;* for when I complained he toldme that I had bettercome here, aS he was onlycarrying out his instructions.
Alderman WiLsoN.-There have been no such orders issued from this court; and even if a boy has jast come out of Holloway there is no reason why he should not be allowed to get his bread honestly in this way, and I think it is exceedthinglymproper toprevent him, Has there been a
MUr. Goodman (chief clerk).-No; this is the first ease of the kind.~ ~ ~~~~i te i-tcsoo Alderman WrLSON.-Well, I should like to see the policeman, to toll him that when a boy is getting an honest
viing without obstructing any public thoroughfare it is very hard that he should be interfered with, and in this case the matter is made worse, because, it seems, he actually compelled a gentleman to go to a dinner party with one boot cleaned and one dirty.
Inspector Scott.-But these boys often geb together in - groups of five or six, and then, when a gentleman stops to
have his boots blacked, they sometimes pick his pocket of his handkerchief.
Alderman WILSON. -That is the gentleman's look out.
Inspector Scott. -I don't say that this boy was a thief, but some of them are.
Alderman WILSON.-Well, that is no reason why you should punish those who are not. I am quite certain tho Lord Mayor has not issued such orders to the police; and if the Police Commissioner has done so I should like you to tell him what I have said.
Inspector Scott said he would certainly do so.
The complainant then withdrew, after thanking the Alderman for his courtesy.
Bo3V-STRFEr.-A boy of 12 years of age, named George Edward Selby, who had been for the last 15 months employed as shopooy by Mfr. Palmer, bookseller and Post-office receiving-house keeper, Lamb's Conduit-street. was brought before Mr. JARDINE, charged with stealing a registered letter containing a half-sovereign and 4s. in silver.
It appeared that on Saturday, at 1 o'clock, a parcel of letters from Mr. Palmer's receiving-house reached the (General Post-office in the ordinary course, and with a letterbill in the ordinary form. But on this letter-bill there appeared an entry of one registered letter, which was not to be found in the bundle. Another letter, not registered, but apparently containing money, was wrapped in the bill. Mr. Coe, inspector of letter-carriers, was instructed to inquire into the matter, and found that the missing letter had been made up and registered by Mrs. Palmer, who was very positive that it was safely wrapped up in the bill, and placed in the bundle, which lay on the post shelf till the collector caUed for it. She had been assisted in making up the bundle by the prisoner. Mr. Cole, suspecting that a child of 12 years old was not unlikely to yieldto suchatemptation, went in search of the prisoner, whom he found at his father's house. The boy at first denied, but on being pressed, acknowledged that he had stolen the letter. He had been desired by Mrs. Palmer to clear the box and "face up" the letters,-that is, place them with the face, or superscription, upwards. He did so, counted them, and told a er the number-13. Mrs. Palmer made out the biUl, wrapped the registered letter in it, put them in the bundle and tied it up. After she had laid it on the post-counter he abstracte the registered letter and substituted the one 'which was afterwards found in the biL He took the money out and threw away the letter as he was going home to dinner. He spent 3d. in coffee, Id. in sweetmeats, and gave id. to a beggar in the street. The half-sovereign, a sixpence and 2d. in copper were found upon him, and 3s. concealed at his father's house.
Mr. Peacock, solicitor to the Post-office, inquired of Mr. Palmer if he did not know it was against the regulations of the Post-office to employ a child so young to assist in clear. ing the box, and if he had not been cautioned to that effect by an officer of the Post-office orly three weeks back.
Mr. Palmer replied, with much warmth, that it was not so, and that Mr. Peacock by his mode of putting the questions was giving an unfair colour to the facts. He had applied for a form of declaration for a boy of 14, and was told he could not have it, as no one under 10 was allowed to take the declaration. But that declaration would (ualify the person who took-it to act aloeie in thePost-office department precisely as he (witness) or his wife could do. He was now aware that such authority could not be given to a person under 16 years of age, but he was not aware that it was against the regulations to employ any one, ever so young, to assist in the presence and unaer the direct superintendence of a properly authorized person. The prisoner had only been employed in this way, and that only occasionaUy and on emergencies.
Mr. Peacock-For how long has he been thus occasionally ,employed ?
Mr. Palmner.-For the last nine months.
Mr. Peacock said the prisoner had evidently commenced by stealing one of the letters when he cleared out the box and then, when he saw the registered letter placed in the bundle, he exchanged the other for it, supposing it contained more money than the first.
Mr. JARDINE inquired of Mr. Dawes, sorter at the . Generat Post-office (who had him called te prove the absence
of the registered letter from the bundle when received there), whether the bundle contained the number of letters stated on the bill, or whether there was one deficient?
Mr. Dawes, after much consideration, declared himself asable to answer the question.
Mr. Palmer said it wvould prove nothing. The letter-bil
night or might not contain the right number, It was not usual to be exact in that matter. The general rule was to state the tens and fives, and disregard the odd nnmbers. Thns 31 letters would be entered as 30, or 34 would be cntered as 35. He had always made up his bils in that way, being so instructed by his predecessor, who had always aone the same thing. He had no instructions from any other qarter
3Mr. 'eacock said it was a very improper way of making up letter-bils. It was equaUy improper t-o employ so young . Person to clear out tno letter box. Ho was grieved to have to prosecute a boy of 12 for such an offence, feeling that it was impossible to expect a child of that age to resist the temptation thrown in his way. He was much to .be Pttied.
Aiir. JeDx said it might be, as Mr. Palmer said, that the prisoner was not usually allowed to act except under his .-own or Mrs. Palmer's direction and observation ; but it was clear that on this occasion he must have had much greater ,opportunity of access to the letters than ought to be permitted. le considered it a very proper regulation that persons under 16 should not be employed in tho post-office Aespartment at all.
The prisoner, who declined to say anything, was com. umitted or trial.

WORmSnIPSTEET.-Isaao Cornell, a tal stout rman, described as a beershopkeeper in Fieldgate-street, Whitechapel, was charged before Mr. DEYNcouIRT with being concerned with other men who have escaped apprehension in the following attempt at robbery.
At a quarter to 6 on Sunday morning week Smith, a constable of theK division, was on duty in Mile-end-road, when he saw the prisoner and three other men busily engaged at the doors and shutters of Messrs. Avila and Naylor, pawnbrokers and jewellers. The witness walked up cautiously, and the prisoner, on catching sight of him, left the door, came boldly up to him, and had just passed him, when the witness saw a stout gimlet had been driven into the door just below the look. He immediately turned and seized the prisoner, and-sprang his rattle, on which the three confedorates ran rapidly off, one of them flinging away a second gimlet as he ran, while in the prisoner's pocket was found a third, and in the doorpost was discovered a fourth gimlet, firmly driven into the wood, the object in using gimlets being that they might serve the purpose of holdfasts, from one of which to the other a strong cord might be passed, to secure the doors externally, and prevent any of the inmates from getting out while the thieves prised out one of the shutters, crushed in a pane of glass, and plundered the window of jewelry, watches, and any other valuables that might be within reach. On the Friday preceding this attempt upon Messrs. Avila and Naylor's premises those of another jeweller in the Caledoni%n-road, Islington, had been served in a similar manner and plundered, the thieves getting clear off with their booty, from the shopman, who had been aroused, being unable to open the doors.
The prisoner only put one question to the constables, but to that he carefully drew the magistrate's attention, and it was this,-whether the clock had not just struck 6 when the first officer (Smitb) first caught sight of him and the other men, as alleged, at the prosecutors' door ? The magistrate listened for the officers' answer, which both men gava in the negative, declaring that they had not only taken the prisoner, but nearly lodged him in the station, when the clock strack 6. An affirmative reply would have removed the offence out of the class of burglaries and reduced it to a common attempt at robbery.
Sergeant Brenchiey now stated that while at Chelmsford in May, 1854, he heard the prisoner tried for felony under the name of Charles Winterborne, and sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment.
Sergeant Smith stated that he first k-now the prisoner at one of the Koseuth demonstrations in Copenhagen-fields; he was then charged with felony and sent for trial, but was acquitted. On the 2d of January he was convicted of an attempted robbery, and 'was afterwards tried at Cam. bridge and sentenced to 14 days' imprisonment. "He is well known," said the officer, " to the City police ag a bad character and the constant companion of thieves. In fact, he is one of the worst we have, under any circumstances."
Prisoner.-I have done my best to earn an honest livelihood, and 1 now keep a beershop.
Smith.-Yes, I know that too, and that your name is over the door, but I reaUy don't believe that one honest mast has entered it since you have had it. The place is of most disreputable character, and young thieves of very tenderyears are constantly found there. You once also kept a coffeehouse not much better.
The prisoner did not deny any of these allegations, and was fully committed to Newvgate for trial.
Tu.urAMs.-" R." and " I. P." have each sent the second half of a 51. Bank of Enigland note for the poor-box.
SO=AVARl[.-Mr. BURCHAlm has received 51. froma Mr. Blizzard, of High-street ; a post-office order for 1Os., from "D. P. ;" and half a 51. Bank of England note from

Vaccination And Smallpox.
L trVACCINATOZr ANYD SMALLPOX.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-In the Registrar-General's return for the last quarter of 1856, published in The Times of the 3d inst., it is stted that in the south-western division " Vaccination is neglected, and smaUpox has been fatal in several cases." Fourteen cases are rnentioned as having proved fatal at Salisbury, and seven at Looe, in Cornwal, where, it is added, " many persons delay, if not entirely neglect to have their children vaccinated."
This statement, I believe, conveys an imperfect notion of the state of the facts and the feeling prevalent in the minds of the lower orders with respect to vaccination * and I am induced therefore to hope that the importance of the subject, not only to the inhabitants of the two infected places (of the latter of which I am spiritual pastor), but to the country at large, will be my apolo for addressng you upon the subject.
The total number of seven fatal cases, though large iu a population of about 1,700 inhabitants, will give probably but a faint idea of the extent to which smallpox has lately prevailedamong the poorer classes in this place. In the arger number of cases, as in those which terminLted fataly during the last quater, vaccination has, no doubt, been neglected, but in many cases I find that it has taken place, and in some with all the indications which are usually considered to denote success. In whatever way, then, subsequent failure is acconnted for, whether by an imperfect inoculation in the first Instance, or by the necessity of periodical repetitions of the Process, or, as in one instance, when the operation had been apparently most successful, by the abistraction of matter from the pustule for the purpose of vaccinating other children-the consequence remains that, while the disease has swept throngh this and other places during the last year, the prejudice of the poor against that which we teUl them is a prevention of smallpox, hut which they see to be in many cases ineffectual, and beLieve moreover to be absolutely prejudicial, becomes stronger and more generaL. What I would suggest, therefore, is, in the first place, the exceeding desirableness of some authoritative exposition,of the cir. c nstances mder which vaccination may be relied on as having done its 'work as a preventive of smallpox ; and, in the second, the absolute necessity for devising some better machinery than at present exists for producing general vaccination among the people. At present it is a punishable offence in parents to neglect the vaccination of their children; practically, however, there is no machinery for taking cognizance of this particular form of delinquency. The district surgeon cannot be expected to move m the matter, for, independently of other considerations, popularity among the lower classes in his neighbourhood is an important consideration in the case of most of those who accept the ill-paid office of union doctor; the registrar has done his work when he has placed the printed notice of the duty and the penalty which may be inflicted for the neglect of it in the hands of the parents; and so, according to the old saying, " what is eveiybody'l business is nobody's business," and the act becomes in many cases a dead letter.
In the hope that this communication, if inserted in TheF 'ime, may draw public attention te a subject so manifestly important, I am. Sir, your obedient eei-vNd,
JAMES HUGHES.

The object of the association is to induce parents to keep their children at school longer and more regularly than is at present the custom, and to hold out to them an additional motive to diligence and good conduct. The conditions of competition for boys are that they shall have attended an elementary school for two years, and that they shaU have a certificate that they have attended such school for 176 days in each year, and possess a good character for religious knowledge. Girls are expected to possess a good hnowledge of neediework and the maldngof femnale clothing. There is to be an examination of the candidaths in the month of June next inx Derby, and the ninount given is iot to exceed 1001., which wil be distributed in sums of .1,, 21, and l. according to the proficiency of the candidates.' A handsomely printed certificate wil be given to each successful candidate, certifying the prize, which will be a valuable testimonial to employers, and tLe amount of the prze mwill be invested in khe savings-bank to the credit of the accessful candidate, and given up at the end of two yeha. Should the candidate die before the expiration of that time, then it will be handed over to his or her paets. In order to promote and extend knowledge among the boys after leaving school it is proposed to offer in subsequent years prizes of 5L, each to those candidates who shag pAss through a satisfac'ory examination in some one or two books to be selected by the committee. The two gr-t difflculties which have impeded the education of the children of miners have beeta the reluctance of parents to send their children to ichool, and to allow them to remain there while an ordinary elementary education is imparted to them. The practice is, when a child becomes useful at home, or can earn money at work, to remove it from school and the edu, cati ,Wl ichait may ave received issoon forgottent

A GeneralCourt-martial willassembloatForton Barracks to-day for the trial of Henry Jobson, gunner of theArtillery Companies of Royal Marines, for striking Colonel Parke on the occasion of being taken up for punishment on another charge, as we have already reported. The following officers
are ordered to form the Court: -Colonel Thomas Hurdle,, CO., President; Lieutenant-Colonel W. B.Langford, Liehtenant-Colonel G. C. Hant; Captains Ho E. Delacombe, W. P Searle, W. J. Pergelly (all of the Royal Mfarine Light Infantry); IL D. Paget, 66th Regiment; -H. W. Gwyn; M. Benldey, 97th Regiment; Pirst-Lieutenanti J. B. Seymour, and W. R. Jefreys; G. F.

On Friday last an interesting experiment was made on board the Waterloo, 120 guns, flagship, Captain Lord Frederick Kerr, to test the capability of Mr. Clifford's apparatus for lowering boats from a ship's stern. A sternboat of the flagship having been fitted (under the personal directions of Mr. Clifford) with his plan for lowering was during the day repeatedlytested. The great height from the water afforded an admirable opportunity of proving the capabilities of the plan. The boat was manned by 10 men, and lowered several times with ease and rapidity-on one occasion in 10 seconds-by one only of the crew from the boat. The trials were made in the presence of Captain Lord Frederick Kerr and Commander Robert D. Aldrich, of the Waterloo, and Captain James WVilcox, in command of the Hawke, 60 gans, screw steamship, and several other naval officcrs, and were pronounced highly satisfactory.
The Diamond, 27, Captain Cospatrick Hxmilton, arrived at the Great Nore yesterday, and saluted the flag of the Commaander.in-Chief, which was returned by the flagship Waterloo, at 11 45 a.m. Captain Lord Frederick Kerr, in command of the flagship, afterwards proceeded out to her in the Wildfire for the purpose of inspecting the ship, officers, and crew. The Diamond will come into harbour today to be paid off.
The Hawke, 60, screw steamship, Captain James Wilcox, at Sheerness, had her compasses adjusted yesterday. This day is named for her departure to take her station as a Coastguard ship.
The Dragon, 6, paddlewheel steam frigate, Captain William H. Stewart, C.B., at Sheerness, is being dismantled, and is returning her stores, preparatory to her being paid off
Her Majesty's steam frigate Arrogant, 47, Captain H. Lyster, arrived at Spithead yesterday from the West India station, after a long anc tedious passage, and a succession of gales and calMs. On Sunday morning, 60 miles west of the Liard, she spoke the Tagus, Peninsular and Oriental steamer, from Southampton, in search of the missing steamer Colombo. The Tagus had seen nothing of the missing steamer, and after spealdng the Arrogant stood away S.W. The Arrogant is ordered into Portsmouth harbour to be paid off.
Her Majesty's ship Indus, 78, Captain Hay, flag of Rear-Admiral Sir Houston Stewart, K.C.B., Commauderin-Chief on the North American and West India station, was officially inspected in Plymouth Sound on Saturday last by Admiral Sir W. Parker, G.C.B., Commander-inChief of the port, who expressed himself strongly upon the efficiency already attained, reflecting great credit upon Captain Hay and the other officers. Captain Hay still continues in hospital, but is rapidly approaching convalescence, and will probably resume the command in about three months. Captain Wiffiam H. Stewart, C.B., of the Dragon (son of the Admiral), has been appointed to the Indus during the absence of Captain Hay. Sir Houston Stewart takes passage in his own ship to the seat of his command, and vill rehoist his flag this week, it being struck only while waiting Her Majesty's commands at Windsor.
The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Company's ship Tagus, Captain B. Christian, which left Southamptor on Friday at 2 p.m., and the Needles on Saturday at 7 am., arrived In Plymouth Sound yesterday morning after an unsuccessful effort to meet the screw steamship Colombo, Captain J. S. Field, due at Southampton on the 4th inst., with the mails from Alexandria. The Tagus has been as far as long. 6 W., lat. 48 44 N., and has experienced strong southerly and south-west gales and thick weather, and bore up for Plymouth on Sunday evening at 6 o'clock.

To The Editor Of The Times.
-TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Having read in The Timnes of Friday last the report of thepresentation by Mr. Ronndell Palmer, in the House of Commons, of a petition oT one Charles Attwood for an amendment of the law for determixing complaints between masters and servants, into wliich my name was introduced in connexion with two separate cases of alleged hardship,in the one case, in my capacity of a county magistrateand in the other, as a master of servants in husbandry,-f hope I shall not be thought unreasonable in requesting so much space in your columns at the earliest convenient moment as will enable me to make public, as briefly as is consistent with perspicuity, the amount of my actual responsibility in each case. I will confine myself entirely to a bare statement of what I believe in the one case, and know to be the facts in the other, avoiding comment as much as possible.
On Monday, the 4th of August last, Mr. Beane, a gentleman farming about 100 acres of land at Great Parndon, came to me to complain of Charles Attwood having left his work without cause, and having refused to return. His statement was that Attwood came first to work for him in December, 1855, at the wages of 12s. a-week, always paid on the Friday evening, so that the fresh week began on the Saturday morning. He continued to work on those terms till Fridav, the 1st of August, on which day Mr. Beane's foreman, Green, mado a bargain with the men for thecomingharvestmonth; and with Attwood he agreed for the month, from that day, at l1. per week. In tke evening of the same day, when Attwood received his week's money, he said to Mr. Beane, "I hope, master, you wiU make the pound a guinea a-week for the harvest." To which Mr. seane made answer, " If you go on weU with your work- we shall not quarrel about the odd shilling," of to that effect. Attwood's work for the month was to be to go with the horses to plough till the corn was ready to ba carried, and then to go with them carting it. He commenced hisharvest month by coming and working with the horses on the following day, but came no more, but went and let himself to another master for the harvest,
Mr. Beane sent his foreman on the 5th to make complaint before me; on which I gave a warrant -the only means under the act of procuring an appearance. On the 6th the petty sessions were held at Harlow, at which there was no other magistrate present but myself.
Before any formal proceedings were taken I used every effort in my power with Attwood (as I do invariably in every similar case) to persuade him to go back to his master; but he positively refused to do so, though he acknowledged he had no cause for complaint against him ; and, though I told him what the alternative must be, he said, "I will go to prison." On Mr. Beane's foreman being sworn, he verified in every point the above statement of his master, with this addition, that Mr. Beane overtook Attwood as he was going to the bench, and said to hin, "Now, Attwoo$, you had much better go back to your work than be taken before a magistrate. you Z go back and fi>ish the week which you have began, I willgive yoyour IL, and you may then leave if you please." To this Attwood's answer was, " I wvll be d-d if I will." I again tried to persuade him to go back; and even after his commitment was signed I told tho pollce-constable if he would yet alter his mind he might, and the eommnitment might be returned to me.
In the secondcase of hardship in thepetitionermyposition was that of master, and the son of the petitioner was my servant in husbandry. Thomas Attwood had worked for me as ploughman and horsekeeper since quite the beginning of 1856 at 12s. a-week, except in harvest month, when he had 25s. a-week. His week ended, and his wages were
'aid on the Saturday evening; consequently, as horsekeeper, wm week commenced on Sanday morning. On Monday, the 15th of Docember, I went into the farm stable at 6 o'clock, when the boy told rae none of the men were come. Attwood was usually there soon after 5 o'clock. I waited till 7 o'clock, before which time the other men were come. I then sent one mile and a-half to inquire if Attwood was ill, or whether he waslikely to come, as there was no one to go to work with his horses. The answer brought back from his mother was that she had not seen him since Sunday morning. The consequence wvs that the horses had to stand still all that day. On inquiry, I learned that Attwood had fed the horses on Sunday morning, but had not been to them afterwards. On the afternoon of Monday, not being able to learn any tidings of ttwood, I engaged another man to go with the horses. On the Tuesday morning I found Attwood in the stable at 6 o'clock, as well as the new man whom I had engaged. I said to Attwood, " You are not to go with the horses to-day - tbey stood stiUl all day yesterday through your fault. i will have no words with you now; you may go; but before you do any more for me yon shal give an account of yourself before a magistrate, and I shall get a warrant." I have not seen him again since. I made my complaint to a neighbouring magistrate the next
dahave never seen tho petitioner Charles Attwood since his commitment until Sunday the 8th inst., when he came to my church, and afterwards he came up to me, and said he hoed I would forgive his son. I told him it was a pity he h not thought of that before he presented such a petition to the House of Commons; if he had, Tom might havo been back at his work long ago. He said with reference to the petition, "Oh, that was not my doing that was done while I was in prison, though, of course, I have been to Mr. Palmer, at Nazeing, about it several times since."
I have eonfined myself strictly to what I believe to be the facts of the caso in which I am implicated as a magistrate, and to what I know to be the facts of that in which my conduct is called in question as a master; and in neither case do I feel conscience-stricken that I have harshly strained the law. I am. Sir, your obedient servmnt.
