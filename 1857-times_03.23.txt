TN afew ~ys ou ill e caledupon to elect your
rbicha ~aveat ezttbetw--enu ns renud-er-it leea neocur on m rs; to enter into a lengthened -eplanation of my principles than if f were a stran,ger seeking for the firttime to obtair a seAt Parliament.
It is hardly needrul for me to dwell upon the immediate adnarrow cause of the present appeal to the country on the part of the existing Admistration In sending out a Plenipotentiry to Chins with powers superior to those of SirJobn Bowring. Lord Pa'roerstou has hmself practically oondemned thst unfortunate policy,for condemning which the present Parliament is to be dissolved.
The really important quesion at stake is the future fortunes of our own country. e are at least in acondition ot Eropenpeace, which It Ih the bounden daty of our rulers to maintain. It is not less strin
gent duty on theirpart to wravl themselves of the opportunityto push with vigour and s glenese of purose measures tenng to te social, zcoral and material well-being of the people. Snob questions pO##es
a peculiar interest in myreye andtheyebalTeverbedealtwithb yme, not in the spirit of pa snship, but by fairly testig them according to their own merits, a they tend ornotto promote the reateetlhappinew of thegreatest number. While we amend what is faulty we must he F careiul not to tamper with ihe principles of exiting institutioaN, or
the acrednesof individualrights. of these rights the most Important is that of Liberty of Consdence While I am myself a sincere member of the pure and Reformed Church happily established in our land. I contend for equal fair play on the part of the State towards alt other persons who with like sincerity hold different views
The sudden dissolution of Parliament will, be in one respects ble3sing, it It tends to qulcken the rOgreM of legal reform, which has bean paralysed in the feeble hands ioto wh itbaslately fallen -ay, quick and cheap jusUce for all clases Is what the nation demand and the new Parliament will fail in iteduty if it does not aeriosl an witbout delay devote Itself to this neeesitry
With referenoe to the Income-tax mybest exertions shall not be wanting to relieve the people of an impot, the burden of which pbeses directly or indirectly upon all of us, Any Adminitrtion must find the means to combine reduction of taxation with the maintenancs of our m,atTonal establshments upona footing alike eaficientandecosoaical, and yet must net make usuh roaction an excu forcidppipng tibe grant which direcwy tend to the immediatobene5t ef the whole community.
With me it Is no umme%ning form of words tosay thatlomr lnvl Interests will everbeoafisotobject. Living inyourpart of th3 comtry, and identified witb It as I aM the proser iof fdBtoue wil lwars be tome, as it has been, an ob edf personal iety.

They should do so promptly and decidedly.
The present election affords the opportunity. Another stuns is not likely soon to be theis, It ought not to be lost. Other matters may, indeed, for the momnent seem to be more presaing, but this, with its momentous; consequrences, ought to be borne in mind,
The warwith China will coDme to an end, Its immediate antece. dent sud andreut. will paw into the domain of history." But Popery willprvoe a source of increnasng evil, whether at home or abroad whether in our foreign or domestic policy. Wihahudw umn notbo defendedupon pricclple. cousistentiywiths the manintennceof our national institutions. Mr. Gladstone has admitted this, and that the grant would prres to he 1 a them In th~e side of Englond s o long an ti continues,
Protestant electors I we askc you toald us In plucking ont that thorn, that it may no longer be a soarce either of Irritation or of danger.
But it Is said that we are bound by a compact entered into aLt tstq time of the Unoion, to continue this grant, greater fallacy never existedl. There Is no such compect
Al, that the Act of Union cantaine, which can by any vossbIlity be supposed to relate to it, is In these words!:-" That a sum not less titon the sum which has been granted by the Parliament of Iretandi on the livneraof six Years immediately preceding the let day of January, ItDO,inpremiums for tha intemnal encouragement of agriculture or mnanufacvures, or for the maintaining institutions for piousL and chardtable uroes.esball boa p ied for a period of 20 yearsosafter the Union, to snblocal purpesesi rla nd, Lin such manner as the Parlament of the Utkted Kingdom shall dlrect.l
Thereil then, we repet, . no uch compact : and duty to ourselso
our county and our (idos requires that the grant should be with. drawn. his assetion is equally solemn and true. Duty to ourselvee reurei,frPoeyi an anti-socmal system ; duty tocar country,
ensreit, or Popryi an anti national system'; aunto loar Godtand BaTnns,r and to Romanis s themselves, requires it, for Popery Is anj anti-Chritian, anti-Scriptural, idolatrous, aud soul.desroiug ssem.
But the grant, It is said, is smalL. Be It so. No auth amount, however, is given by the Slate to any other body for the purpose of eclelsaastica education. 'Popery is the only body so faroueod. Why should Popery be sdeletd for State favour beyond all other sect.?
We ob'et howvr to the grranut upon princip-le. The hoot interests of tie conr eadit. repeal. We cannot here argoe the grae oestousatissue between Protertnism and ropery, wheheron hecegiator political grounds, Time aud space forbid. Thatwasdon attheperiod of the Great Rteformatlon in the 16th centry,andof he evoutin i th 17th. Nor will we abandon thie bla 'vntae goud o whch hoe eent. have pinord us,

If atree can belanown by its fuit, Popery stands self-condemned. The annals of that Chrch and the pagesofthiste7y sie up in jedgmet,tagainst her. Churebes once dies and pure, brought unilerher influence, have lost at once their purity and their Independence. Nor has that influences been leas disastrous to matons, Yet " Rome can flourish in the country which it rains," and, by dividing councils, whether in Cabinetg or int Churches, she scoksl the accmplishment of their over. throw andI her own exaltation. Thus, then, we kave Churches and niations, the vOles of Scripture, and the testimony of histoDry, Pointing to Popery, not indeed as the rook on which to build for safety, but lie the reckL to be avoided by those who would steer seenrely the vessel of the State, and be themselves presmerd from the ruin predicted of the great apoetacy--and Its Tictims.
But some affet to despis Popery. Are they therefore wise 1 let usseoowhat it isdoing.

Look at the resource is already possesses-I the number of itseebhools, colleges monasteries and nunneries, churc6es-aye, and splendid cathedrati, Regarding thesepoints in one concocted view, aist noet ear that we are at a crisis such as, pehaps, never before occurred ? Is Is too mnuch to say, that the now Parliamueat may dletermine the relative postions of Popery and Protestanttsm for years to come ?
A, few statistics may herebeoof service. Not to spealc of Ireland. there ate in Esglnud and Wa:ea 730 Bootishi churches or chapel, 10 colleges,W00otonvents, 23 monasteries, and 915 priests, and theme are In S, atiand 184churoehm ,chapels, or srtations,%six convrents, 130 Priests, und one college, and in our ooloninl and tribute y peceemlous there are no lenas than 55 Archabishaops,Biaobps, and Vicars Apotlc
Some of these have been educatwa a Pt0m u evne n then the evil we have infILted upon. Irelaffan oeo oetbot w doom. Others am tobefound intheooolonicesand in the UnitedgSates. It appears In the evidence under the recent Royal Commission of Inqulr~estMaynoth,that the pres-ent Itomish chebishop of Calcutta, the ishBisopsof Madras Hyderabad, and Adelaide, and the Romish Archbishop of Sl LoDuis: in the statea of Missouri were brought up t Maynooth, to say nothing ot presets now In Euglinauand Scotland.

Why, but because this system, Popery, which maany affect to despise as powerlews or feeble. Isto powerful that sueccessve Goverumento h4av foundx themselves unable to c3ntrol it?

LECTORS of the UNITED KINGDOM I You .L are asked, while you upholo the Church of England, to abolish:
hurch-rates, The Committee of XAymen, at the present criis, feel It their duty to bring the f.-lowing facts and reasons before you:-
1. The leos of annual reTenue by the abolition of church-rates may be estimated at £310,100,. It is said that this may be made up he voluntary contributiona. Experience doss not warrant this, The churrbeslin parishes dependent on voluntary suDppot are man- of them miserably neolected. Whence are new funds to come, especially in couLtry parihes?
2. But why abolish church-rates The awer of your oDponents it: because so many Perishes obJect to lev them. But, obser there are atout 12,O00 parishes in England and Wales. Returns recntly tmade to Parliament. from 9,428 parisbes, soow that out of that numb,r, P,274 have not refused, and continue to collect, the rate- only 416 relues It. Of the remaining perIahbs 287 have estates or other sourcesofsupport;and08-manyofthemtownparlrhea-aremaitaLined by varlous expedlen until the low is made effctive, In a few prses ratessar only Partally ooliezted, while some, who had formerly refused, bave sseu=ently irauts,d the sate. 125 consist of replies didh. cult to understend If among the remainlog 21,100 (from which there are no returns) there be any which have refused th salrae, it seems rearcely probable that a return of thbe fact would have been neglected.
tereore,In ninety-five out of every hundred perishes the rAte is
000ctAae D p&rishet to be despoiled. becaus 400 pauizhes to Ragland andWales refuse? Is thl4 reasonable orvsst?
3. It is asked, why net, for the sake of peace, give up chuxrch-r%tes?Our eY hiL Because weo must make previsiDn for the religious wor ship oI hose who cannot provide It for themsrelves, But we cannot have public worship without churces,t nor the oadintanoe of religion wlthout suficient provison for them. I the object be to overthrew the Ehibtahesbd Church. let that object be avowed, I[f the Church Ig to be upheld, hurch-ratessahould continue.

NEW MEMBER.
The O'DONOGHOE took the oaths and his seat for Tip. perary.
THE COLLECTION OF THE INCOME-TAX.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHIEQUER laid upon the table a report from the local offlcer engaged in the collection of income-tax In the county of Stafford, with reference to some complaints as to the collection of the tax in thatcounty which were made in the course of the debate upon the Income-tax Bill.
TEE RETAIL SPIRIT TRADE. Ia reply to Mr. Ouvmx.A,
TheCHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said, that the propriety of granting to wine and spirit merchants who were not licensed victuallers permission to sell a less quan. tity of spirits than two gaUons had for some time been under consideration by the Government, but there were difficulties in the way of such an alteration of the law which had not yet been overcome.
RETURNS.
Mr. V. HARCO'URT called the attention of the right hon. gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer to a return which had been presented to the House with respect to the urchase of the Erugel CoUection of pIctures for the ational Gallery, but which did not clearly and awurately show the cost of that coUection, and the amount realiked by the sale of pictures not thought deserving of exhibition. He hoped that the right hon. gentleman would take cae that in future these returns were made out in a more intelligible form.
NAPLES.
Mr. T. DUJNCOMBE.-Will the noble viscount at the head of the Government permit me to ask him whether since the withdrawal of theolegations of France and ngland from Naples, any overtures have been made by the King of Naples to the British and French Governments for the return of those embassies - and, if so, whether those overtuies are likely to be acceptable to the two Governments? I ask this in consequence of the appearance in Tke 7nes this morning of a statement, that an envoy has gone from Parls
ith a niew of settling the differences which exist betwreen the Neapolitan Government and those of England and France.
Lord PALTIERSTON.-No overtures, proprlyso called, have been received by the British and French Governments from the King of Naples since the discontinuance of diplomatic relations. An indirect intimation has, however, reached us that the Neapolitan Government was ious to know whether, if the King of Naples were to carry Into execution the convention made with the Argentine Confederation, under which the poltical prisoners now retained in the prisons of Naples were to be banished to tho Argentine Republic, that wouad be considered by the two Governments as a substantial beginning of that more moderate system of government which we wished to see established at Naples. SpeakIn only for the British Government, we do not think that clearing the prisons of Naples by sending the prisoners into banishment in South America, with the intention, no doubt, of replenishing those prisons by means of fresh arrests (hear, hear), would b SuchIa change of system as could be considered by us as accomplishing the purposes for wrhich diplomatic relatons were broken off. (Hear, hear.)
TREATY WITH MOROCCO.
Colonel W. PATTEN asked the noble lord at the head of the Government whether it was true that our Minister at Tagier had concluded a treaty with the Sultan of Morocco by which great facilities were secured for British and Euro. pean commerce throughout the dominions of thatnpotentateo and, if so, wvhether there wvas any objection to making public the provisions of that treaty?
Lord PALMERSTON.-The ansrer to my hon. friend's question will best be given if you, Sir, will permit me to go to the bar, and will have the kindness to call upon me when I am there.
The noble Vr8corNcv then went to the bar, and, having been calld uapon by the Speaker, presented to the House the treaty which had been referred to, and which was ordered to lie upon the table.
THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH TO INDIA,
Mr. BOWYER asked the First Lord of the Treasury whether Her Majesty's Governmeit had any estimate of the number of troops which would be required to protect the line of telegraph from Seleuia to Bassorah, and who was to pay for the maintenance of such troops ; also, whether Her Majesty's Government had any estimate of the amount of subsidies which mustbe given to the Arab tribes to forbear from injuring or interfering vwith the telegraph ?
Lord PALMERSTON said, that the protection of the line of telegraph in the Turkish dominions was part of the general system of polce which the Turkish Government would establish in that por'ion of the empire of the Sultan. He had no reason to suppose that proper precautions would not be taken for the security of the telegraph.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER,rm answer to the second question of the hon. member, stated that all that the Government had done was in certain contingencies to guarantee to the company which had undertaken to estab"lish this telegraphic communication certain payments. It wias in no respect answverable for the construAction of the telegraph or for its protection from Arabs. These were entirely the affairs of the compay.
CAA$PTAIN WOOD,
Capti RBAI who ha Previously p resented a gptition from Captain Wood, late paymsster of the depdt
ttalion at Winehester, complaining that he had been calld upon with the assistance of only one clerkto discharge duties,. in the performance of which two paymasters and seven clerks had afterwards been engagedp and bad thus beeh compeRled to resign, Jhgreby losin hI& chance of an additional pension of 9i'SJAhy moved or the production of copies of the correspondence which had taken place between Captain Wood and the War Department from the date of hIis appointment to the present time; but upon it being represented to him by Lord P ALsrroq that the order if made would, owing to the dissolution of Parliament, be of no value, thChon. and gallant member with. draw his motion.
THE CHINESE EXPEDITION.
Sir D. IX EVANS inquired of the noble lord at the head of the Government what nuhnber of Marines were Wobe seist with the expeditiont to China ? It was desirable that the Marines should beata largepro rtion^to the soldiaers of the line, as they were peculiarly well dapted for the opera;

Sir D. L EVANS also sked whether any deps habd been taken to relieve the de3titntion of the wives and childron of the soldiers who were quartered in the camp at Colchester?
Lord PALMERSTON replied that he was quite sure that the War Department badevery dissitoa to make all pratcal arrangements for the rehef ofthis distress,
THE PROROGATION.
The House had now disposed of all the basiness before it, and, after "Use of some minutes, Sir Augustus Clifford Usher of the Black Rod, appeared at the table and minimorted the Commons to attend in the House of Lords to bo present at the Prorogation of Parliament.
The SPEAKER, in obedience to this summons left the chair and proceeded to the other House, followed by Iord Palmerston, Sir G. Grey, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and about 60 or 70 other members. Mx. Disraeli and Mr. Henley remained eated upon the front Opposition bench, and Sir J. Graham, who came in after the speaker had left the House, in his usual seat below the gangway. On the Speaker's return, the zight hon. gentleman took his place at the clerks' table, and, the members ;ann1 gathered round him, he, as usual, read to them the Spee which ha just been delivered by the Royal commissioner. Having done this, he reoeived the congratulations and adietx of those over whose deliberations he had that day for the last time presided- and thus {he session was brought to a termination. The aiainent atill existed, but only until a Royal proclamation should number it with the things that were.
Preaching And Preaching.
PBEACHINE AND PBEAHIjNG.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIM!ES.
Sir,-I am glad to ee that the stone which I threw the other day into that sluggish pool, the preaching of the Church of England, has caused a great ecclesiastical fish to 'ise to the surface. I cannot for a moment doubt that " Cantab " is one of those Professors of Divinit whose classes are so well attended in that famous University. As fishes are know by their gills and fin I know him by his st,yle and logic; andthongh 1 do not care to mention his name, you may find it among the four greater Prophets.
Now, before I deal with this learned mans argument, I may clear the wa by advisin hum not to quote Pascal and Bossuet until he is qu1tce sare that he has mastered the elements of French grammar. If he will give himself a private course of lectures on that excellent little book, Prench in Five Lessons, he will learn-sup poing these are not mistakes of your com-
ositor,w 7ch I can searcely believe*-that the de betore campte ought tohavo been du, and that voix has always been feminine til this learned Professor made it maculine. , while taking this trouble on his own account, he will, for the sake of the genieral public, have the kindness to construe ecessu amore Doi I am sure we shall be all much obliged to hir.
But to the purport of his letter. Fortified by a sentence from the wr.tings of Pascal, he suggestshe is too charitable to say it outright-that I am "c a sayer of good things," and therefore " a bad character." Now, if I were to retort on this learned Professor in a drict contradictory, and declare that he is "agood character" because "he says bad thiings"-uancharitable things-of his neighbour, the fallacy of both the original proposition and its c ontradictory would be self-evIdent. But I am too generous to say thi-I only suggest it, and content 37yself with the remark that had Pascal never said anything more profound than thia " curiously embedded" sentence which the Professor has dug Up out of his remais, nowr somewrhat fossilized, his existence wrould bosas completely ignored by the wrorld of letters at the present day as that of the learned Professor will surely be 20 years hence.
WfelL, but I am uncharitable myself, because I have compared an archbishop's-not necessarily the archbishop of Canterbury's, it was reserved for the learned Professor to fit the cap on his friend's head -pread1ia with that of a Baptist minister, and
in favour of the Dissenter. Now, I exp?ressly used the term Archbishop of -in order that the miserable preaching whbich prevails in tho upper ranks of the Church, and not the dersons out of whose mouths it proceeds, might be designated. This abstract personilication wi not suit the Profesor; nothing will satisfy him that Ifdo not mean the Archbishop of Canterbury; and, having settled that point, he proceeds tosp the present head of the dhurch of e3ngland for the possession of virtues which I never said he ranted, and drags in an apocryphallegend of Stb John in order to strengthen Ahis position and heap rosas of fire on my head
And nowe, suppos I were to take this man at his word, could I not crush him ? Are there not higher duti6s than that of respect for a mild, wornout arch-
ishopn? Is thera not an Aaron's red which swallows thls up, together with el minor duties and all false shame, insthepconviction that more goodvmaybe done by speaking out as to the state of the Church than '! latterig any awhbishop, however estimablo and hrtuous? The Profeasor reads the Bible, I sUppose, sometimes, as well as Pascal. Hai~ he ever seen the text, "Suffer hlttle children to come unto me and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of Heaven ?" How admirably the Church of England, as at present constituted, secures this b'.y her servicesg 1 ow tenderly she nurses these innocents and entices them to her communion First of all, owe hve three servies rolled ito one; parts, each beautiful in itself, but incongruous and disjointed, andwearyingintheirpresentshape; a vain repetition and conglomerate of prayers, litanies, psslmody, and communion service; and, after al, a fearful exDectigo of drowsiness and disgast in the inlevitable sermon preached sometihes by a booy who would not earn lOs. a-week in any other trade, who has not and never will have any power o expression; sometimes by an old man, who is supposed to have been able to preach some 40 rears back, long before the memory of the oldest inabitant, but who cannot now be heard even by the clerk. "Go to hear old Parson - ptreach, Sir !why, I'd as soon listen to a bumble bee in a churn as listen to him," was the answer lately made by a respectable working man in a rural parish to anf expostula,on against attending a Dissenting chapeL Nor does your dseek, middle-aged divine, who ought to be old enough to have learnt the art of preaching, and not too old to have forgotten it, often make a satisfactory exhibition of his powers ln the pulpit. One I knon has a perpetual cold in hIs heed, In another the catarrh has slipped halfway down into his throat, in another it is deep-seated in the lngs. Thae faith that istens to these men ithout languishing to atrophy must be strong indeed. Another is a martyr to gout, an, his sermons are full of crotchets, and aches; and twinges. I ruppose, as the Alps melted at the presence of vinegar, our stony hearts are exectdhtoield to this sorry, sour stuff. Another is opsel and certainly his style iswso inflated as to beptattapping. Tareheart,th ewater cure may do you good. This man's wife teazes him; he has never a moment's peace; so discord and strife on earth, destruction and perdition to the Pope, with te certain hope of everlasting damnation to aUl the congregation, down to the smallest charity child, if they do not combine to pul down Maynooth, are thewarp and woof of every discours. The strange thing is that, though every one is eager to escape the agonies of these discourses, the menwho preach them go home ster their day's work is over and think they have done God good service. Nfo wonder, w.hen the Church of England pats them on the back and says, " Well done, thou good and faithful servant; thou hast had three full services and preachea two sermons of three-quarters of an hour each. SIroreover, thou hastnever had a single short service; thou hast always given the faithful full measure-two hours and a-quarter by the clocka; go home now in peace and eat your anup per." And as, by the obstinacy of the Church, which has accustomed herself to the notion thatanyone can preachthe fact being that few men can preach at al-the children's bread is note perhaps, thrown the doas, for there is no breae to throw; but still the children starve.
Again, if this learned Professor had thought of another text, and who it was that said, "Let the dead bury their dead, but follow thoui
me," he would have known that there are seasons in the history of the Church when al
eonslderations of natural affection and personal. respect must be thrown to the winds if they come into collision with the sense of duty which lies before
eu. The question, therefore, aris this such a season? Ltokat the millions on this country who scarce know thei right hand from their left. Look bt the cbsmae'of Lohdo w the ignorance of Man-

Think of th& tens of thousands in all large towns, and the teins of hundreds in rurhldistricts who have never heard so ,nuchas the name of Jesus, whoselives are passed in. apathy and ignorance, in wrong and robbery, in lust and infam, because they have either never beea to church at a in youth, or, being there, have returned disgusted by the-weariness of services rhich they cannot undertand, or the imcompetence of
iaters who cannot preach, Think of the numbers whom the Churci absolutely refuses to educate; think of the numbers of the poor practically excluded from Christian worship by the mere length of our Church services, so that, in large towns at least, the Church of England has come to be a church of the rich and not of the poor; and then tell me if this is not a season when this high and mighty Church of England-which, in its upper ranks at least, "liveth in luxury," and is, perhaps, " dead w.hile she lveth,"-might not afford to waive certain differences with the Dissenting body, and say, " My brethren, the harvest isready, but the labourera are few; join us in the great battle which, as soldiers of Christ, we are al bound to fight against sin and crime. You have a man among you able to make his voice heard, whose words touch the hearts of his hearers, who has the modern gift of tongues; our churches are open to him as to a labourer whom the Lord of the harvest has sent." This would be at once a dignified, a generous, and a
ise policy on the patt of the Church of 3ngland. Shall we seeit adopted I
And now I have done, with one question more to the learned Professdr, which a man so well veraed in the history of the Gospel ag will, of course ba perfectly able to answer. The baptism of 'the Apostles and of the frst centuries, was it infant or adult I Was it by immersion or sprinkling? Perhaps, as he knows so much about St. John's last moments, he will tell us whether the rite as " the beloved disciple" saw it solem d in our Saviour's days approached more nearly to the practice of the Church of England or to that pursued by Air. Spurgeon's form of Dissent.

HIGHLAND SOCIETY.-On Saturday evening the
HIG0 AND SOcI.-On Saturday evening the anniversary festival of this national and patriotic ociety was celebrated at tho Freemasons Tavern with great 6cld
in commemoration of the battle of Alexandria, where the heroism of the Scottish troops was so memorably displayed. The hall was decorated with much taste with the banners of the various leading clans. About 100 noblemen and gentlemen sat down to dinner, nearly aU of whom were in Highland costume or in full uniform, 25 officers lately belong. ing to the Highland brigado in the Cnmea havi
been specially invited for tho occasion. The Ear of Eglinton took the chair, supported by Major-General Cameron and Sir Malcolm M'Gregor, and there were also present Campbellof Islay, theChisholm, ColonelA.Cameron, Sir James Grant, Sir Arthur Halket, Archdeacon Williams, Colonel Lake, and Major Teesdale, of Kars, Deputy-Sheriff Crosley, Lieutenant-Colonels Clephone, Ewart, and Spence, &c. A most sumptaous dinner having been disposed of, the Chairman gave the usual loyal and patriotio toasts which were drunk with full Highland honours. The toast of the evening, "To the Memory of Abercrombie, and the Heroes who fell with him at the Battle of Alexandria," was next given, and drank in solemn silence. Other compli. mentary toasts, including " the Chairman" and the " Clefs and Clans," followed, and were eloquently responded to, till the close of the evening. During the course of the entertainment a reel of four was most admirably danced by Lieutenant Macpherson, Captain MKinnon, Campbell, of Islay, and Mr. Bain, the secretary. The band of the children from the Royal Caledonian Asylum was in attendance, and executed several piemcs with their customary taste and precision; and during the intervals the Qaeen's Piper gave Caledonian airs with all his well-known vigomr and clearness. The whole festival passed off in the most satisfactory manner.
COMPENSATION Pon RAiLwAY IKJURI.-At the County Sheriff's Court at York, on Friday, before Mr. W. Blanshard, assessor, the case of "W aterhouse v. the NorthEastern Railway Company" was heard. The declaration alleged that the plaintiff was a passenger on the defendants' railway, and that through their negligence he sustained various injuries, in respect of which he claimed 4,000b An action was brought, tne defendants suffered judgment to go by default, and the only question for the jury therefore was what amountof damages the plaintiffwas entitled to. The plaintiff was one of the passengers in an excursion train which was run into at Cherch Fenton station at midnight on the 25th of July last. He was seated in one of the carriages which was smashed to pieces, and sustained very serious injuries-viz, scalp woumds, contused shoulder, lacerated leg, and broken ribs. The plaintiff is a young man, 2S years of age, i3 married, and has one child, and it is doubtful whether he will ever be able to attend to business as ho was before the accident. After a deliberation of two hours and a half the jury returned the damages at 2,2001. A similar case, "Braim v. North-Eastern Railway Company," was next heard, the plaintiff being the husband of one of the passengers who was killed by tho accident. The defendants consented to a verdict for 1,000L, one half to go to the widower, and tho other half to be equally divided amoDg the children. In a third case,
Ni2cholson v. the North-Eastern Railway Company" the defendants agreed to give 1501. in oDmpcnsation for the m- juries sustained.

The Bank.return of lst week bein regardd al comparatively favourable, the English funds lisve been firm to-daY at a further improvement of au eighth. Consols for money, which left off last 6vening at 93i to i, were first quoted 93g to i, and they afterwards touched 93g. The final transactions, however, were at 93a to X for money and 931 to } for the 8th of ApriL xchequer-bonds closd at 98i to 99; India Bonds, 2s. discount.tw 2g. premium; and Exchequer-bills (June), 2s, disount to 2s. premium, (March par to 4s. premium.
In the discount-marlet there was a full inquiry for money at the current rates. At the Bank ;the demand wa3 moderate. The amount of gold with. drawrn for exportation vas 10,0001.
Foreign securities have been steady, with a limited amount of business. Turkrish Six per Cents
for the account, were negotiated at 981 and i, Mix the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, at 101+. The other operations comprised-.Mexl. can, for the account, 23&; Portuguese Three per Cents., 44{; Rusian Four-and-a-Half per Cents, 97i; SardimianLFive rCents., 90 and M; Dutch Two-and-a-Half per uents., 65; ana the Four per Cent. Certificates, 9.
The closing quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evemnig were 70f. 70c. for money and 70f. 90c. for the account, showing a reaction of rather more than an eighth.
The Riga Railway Company have announced " the successful termination of their negotrations with the Russian Govdrnment." Their concesfion has been extended from 56 to 75 years, the capital has been reduced in consequence of changes in:thQ length and route of the line, and "the terms iJ now arranged enable the directors to substantiate the original representation of a minimum interest of 6 per cent. upon the required capital." The shares are to be reduced from 1001. to 201. each, and the calls will be made over a period of three years. The exact details have yet to be received, and meanwhile it must still be difficult to form an opinion as to the value of the concession, although the sbares have improved upon the announcement. A favourable feature of the scheme, as it was originally understood, was that the shares with 801. paid were to be redeemed at 1001. The concession Is now stated to be prolonged to 75 years, but nothing is said regarding the terms of redemption. It must also be borne in mind that when the prospectus was first issued the public knew nothing of the intention of the Russian Government to swamp the European markets during the next 10 years with 45,000,0001. of their railway securities nor of their plan of diverting the commerce of R by constructing a line to the port of Libau and inePrusian frontier.
The railwaymeeting of the week, with the exception of the Caldonian Company, have comprised only those of secondary undertakings. The shareholders of the Great Western have authorized the directors to proceed with the Bill before Parliament to enable the Great Western, Bristol and Exeter, and South Devon Companies to afford further assistance for completing the CornwaU Railway between Plymouth and Truro, and for other purposes. The report of the Scottish NIorthEastern Company is not altogether satisfactory, but a steady improvement will, it is hoped, shortly take place. The average rate of interest paid by the company is stiUl as high as 41. 15s. 2d. per cent,, though this will be reduced as the bonds fall due, the directors expecting to obtain assistance on lower terms. The shareholders of the Bristol and Exeter Company have authorized their directors to support the BiU promoted by the Great Western and other Boards for completing the route between Plymouth and Truro of the Cornwall Railway. According to the report of the Selldrk and Galashie's Railway the directors, owing to an unadusted claim of the contractors, are unable to state tire whole of the liabilities. A special meeting will be called on a future day, when a complete statement will be submitted and proposals made for raising the necessary funds to effect a liquidation. At the North British meeting the report was adopted. It wai
stated that the revenue has improved, that the expenditure has been diminished, and that the finanoes are capable of discharglng every legitimate demand. The dividend of the Caledonian Company has been confirmed and the report adopted. The large increase of earnings has not been accompamed by any augmentation of working expenses. The chairman complained of the conduct of the Scottish Central Company in diverting the traffic from the Caledonian route. The Motherwell deviation line is still incomplete, but is expected to be opened at Midsummer. At the Edinburgh, Perth, and Dundee meeting it was mentioned that the whole of the debenture debt falls due in May, and that the directors are now engaged in making arrangemen's for renewals of the loans.
The committee of consultation appointed at the January meeting of the Australian Agricultural Company have just issued their report. It is well drawn up, and presents another remarkable iMustration of the way in which property at a distance belonging to shareholders m England is habitually squandered, the directors at home being too numerous and too much occupied with their own parsuits to bestow the prompt and vigorous watchfulness u,pon itwhichaprivateperson wouldfeeltobeessenhal to safety. In the present case the companyhave a paid-up capital of 380,0001., and a free grant from the Crown of 690,702 acres of valuable land in a flourishing colony, and yet it was found from the last report of the directors that, instead of a profit for the year, there had been an actual loss of several thousand pounds. The stock of horses, once famous, and obtained at a heavy outlay, has been alowed to become deteriorated and comparatively worthless. The merino sheep, which represent in the books 130,0001., are now estimated at 5,0111.; of the cattle large numbers have been irretrievably lost, owing to their not having been mustered since 1848; the correspondence has been neglected, 43 despatches from the directors on this side being allowed to remain without acknowledgment at one time; the annual accounts have not been transmitted until after the lapse of nearly a year; and speculative shipments from the company's coal mines, involving a loss of 6,4001., have been made without authority, and in the face of orders to the contrary. It also appears that the accounts in the colony have never been audited, and that large sums have been wasted in road-making. In this state of affiairs the only satisfaction is that the property of the company is now under the care of a newr superintendent, MIr. Eodgson, who is to act wFith a committee of advice in Sydney, while the directors have also sent out to the colony an accountant appointed by themselves, The conmittee concur in the expediency of suppressing the sheep establishments on the Port Stephens estate, and insist that this step should be followed by the dismissal of aU unnecessary hands. They also app rove the p lan contemplated by the directors of letting the ewcastlecollierieson lease. All further expenditare by the company on public works, such an should be left to the local Government, is discounte-. nanced, and, although with the extension of railways the deposits of iron ore on the Port Stephens estate may become so valuable as to render desirable the expenditure of 33,0001. upon a tramway, the committee urge that this should in no case be entered upon, unless the mines shall be previously let on lease at an adequate rental. The committee complain of the throwing away of large sums in applications for acts of Parliame.nt, one of which Is at
present in progress at an anticipated cost of 1,0001, and suggest that by coming under the Limited Liability Act the company could obtain a much better position. A reduction is urged in the office expenses in London, and mr. Coleman, the acconttant, has been employed to frame a system for the company's accounts, With dtict economy and rigid management for the future, although only meagre divdends can be hoped for at present, the committee, looking at the position of the vast tract of property possessed, are disposed to believe that the great expectations at one time formed of the undertaking may yet ultimately be realized. Finally, it is necessary to remark that they attribute the disasters lately sustained to the unfitness of Captain M. F. BrownriggAvho was named superintendent in 1852, and 41e want of promptitude of the directors in ordering his suspension The appointment seems to have en such as too commonly characterize our public companies, shareholders being led either by the private bias of directors, or the sanguine representations of candidates who will promise anything, to trust .their interestawithout control to the hands of peoPle whose pasthistory shouldhave been a warning. The directors, it is stated, conider the character of Captain Brownrigg for honour and integrity =Wl!m4 peached, hut " it appeArs," the committee obsei4e
" among other things, that he had soe time p>.,
viou to, his appointment failed In business an*compounded witli his creditorU." Th6y charge the board, therefore, with a grave error in having made the nOiinatiou, and impress upon the shareholders that t' no individual should hereafterbe app6inted to the responsible office of presiding over their affairs 'who has proved himself incompetent to manage his vwn.,,

The sales of all kinds of cloth have been on a very mode. rate scale, both to the home trade and for export. India cloths, such as the lower qualities of shirtings, madapol. lans, and jaconots, bave continued to attract more atten. tion than most other fabrics, but the business even in these has not been considerable. In these goods, as in printers and domestics, prices remain steady;* but the latter kind of goods have begun to accumulate in stock a little. For yarns the demand has been rather brisker in India and German qualities, but] the home trade buy sparingly. Prices are
BIRMINGHAM, MARIWI 2L
lhe preliminary quarterly meeting of ironmasters, which is fixed for next 'week, creates little interest, and the iron districts at the present moment are apparently more agi. tated by electioneering movements than by the present prospects and future stato of trade. Nothing, in fact, bas occurred-neither excessive demands nor extraordinary depreseion-which is calculated or likely to change the rates of last quarter, and consequently little doubt exists as to the maintenance of current lists. The iron trade through. out the district may be described as quiet, but there are
ght indications of more activitv, especially as regards the exports to the United States.
Some branches of the engine and machine manufacture in the neighbourhood are doing wfell, and railway orders are oming into the district more freely than a few months ago. i3bli, bower, business cannot be represented as more than ordinarily brisk, and somo establishments complain of slack-
The manufactures of Birmingham are suffering much from the continued high prices of metals, and so long as tbere is uncertaimty as to their maintenance the manufac. turers will give out as few articles of tin and copper wares for make as they can. The orders sent in by the factors are as numerous as ever, but they are extremely liht. Stocks among ironmongers and braziers throughout the country arc said to be low, but in the present state of the metal-masket they are loth to purchase more than required for immediate sale.
The export trades of Birmingham at the present time upyear to be most active. Some good orders from South America have recently been received, and these for the nost part are for local productions, the demands for.which have of late been limited. A large purchaser of papier maclF6 goods has visited Birmingham and made considerable purcllases of best desoriptions of articles from first-rate ra"aket s.
The cdged toolmonufacture is busy, and for agricultural Implements and husbandry tools the demand is brisk. This is. no doubt, to be attributed in a great degree to the season of the year, but orders have been this sprig more than ordinasily heavy.
NOTTINGHAM, MARBC 21.
A good demand has been experienced for framework. knitteId fabrics, which maintain full prides. When the elections are over there seems to be little doubt that a great
tpring trade will t,ke place. Letters from the United 8tates mention that a large amount of business is doing there, and that some of ths American buyers are on their way here again to make selections for the fall.
The lace wa-ehonses bave been well visited by home-trade buyers, whose operations have been about to the usual extent. A fair amount of business is doing in the various classes of goods. The trade are not yet aware that there will be any change in fashion likely materially to affect any established branch of the lace manufacture, though it is thought that a large quantity of bugled laces wvll be used in the coming season. Cotton yarns are at full prices, and silks are again dearer.
LEICESTER, AncH 21.
The hosiery trade in most branches is dull, manufacturers for the most part supplying goods for immediate wants. The continuation of genial weather will, doubtless, came an improvement in the demand for goods suitable for the season. As soon as the elections are over a livelier market is expected. Material continues very high.
BRADFORD, MARCII 21.
Thq worsted trade is temporarily dull. This is usually a rather quiet, eriod in this department, but the limitation af business is aggravated by the present state of political affairs. Purchases are therefore inconsiderable.
In yarns there is no material alteration to report. Where new contracts are entered into for worsted yarns-and they are received with caution-spinners demand enhanced rates, the general feeling being that at the termination of the month an advance must be acceded to in order to mnaintan the present rate of production. Cotton warps are not meeting a ready sale, yet prices do not give way.
The wool-market presents a little improvement. An active inquiry prevails for wools suited to combing pur. poses; a fair trade is doing at late quotations in all descrip. tions of long-stapled wools, aud where the staplers manifest any disposition to accept rates slightly in favour of the purchaser, for some quaintie, a good business is transacted. No permanent decline can, however, be anticipated, as. the npply of Endish combig descriptions is comparatively lig t. Clothing wools move off as produced at market at full currencies. The operative classes of the worsted district are in good employment.

LEEDS, MARcH 2L
There in no improvement in the trade of this distric'. The warehouses continue quiet, and the buyers that have been in the town have made purchases on a moderate scale. The orders from the country have been of little importance, and the cloth-halls have also participated in the general dulness. FOr tweeds, cicakings, and other spring and summer mix. tures there tas a pretty Sair demand this morning, and no other descriptions of goods appear likely to Th in much reqwest untilan aglteration i the state of political affairs tends to renviv trade from its Present langour.

He had great pleasure in telling them that the whole of those ques. tions had been amicably rranged, and that the present state of things between the two companies was most cordial. The whole of the accounts would be pre. pared and circulated among the shareholders on Satur-
ay. He had to propose the adjournment of tho meeting to Wednesday next, the 25th inst., at the same place. They did not propose to issue any report, as the position of the company was so clearly defined i their relations with the London and North-Western Company, which were perfectly satisfactory.
The Hon. A. KURAIRD seconded the motion, which was carried unanimoualy, and the meeting adjourned.

The wheat trade in this district hs boen remarkably dull. In the earliermarkets previous prices were with dificulty supported, but since then there has been a general declne of 1s to 2s. The damp weather has6not at all Improvod the condition of the samples brought forward. Melting barley of a good quality is now srco and stands at a good price, but the larger arrivals of Saae and other sots, wbhich aro much used by the largest browers, checks any inordinate advance,
At to-day's market %hero was an excellnt supply of wheat,but ascarcity of thebestqualities. Althoughtherowasno lekof buyers the trade was exoeedingly lagald, and nothing could be disposed oE exceptatareductlonof &d. to la&Derload(1s.4d,to25.8d.perquar ter). The show of barley was lrge.

The cattle trade has been lees buoyant, Here, to-day, there ws a lorge bow of both besets and Bheep, which enabled buyers to upply thoenselves amply with tcok of good quality at last week's rates,

The weather hasbeen fne, but yesterday and to-day were oxtremely col.d,
The local markets havo been rather dull, At King's Lynn, on Tuesday, wheat declined Is. to 1SL, and at other places a downward tendencymanifested Itself. Barley has on theowhole supported previous rates, Here to-day the best desciptions of wheat were a shado lower, and other sorts wero noglected, Barley, which maintained last wook's prioes, Is now coming forward in smaller quantities as the malting seasonisdrawingto acdoso. It is undergtoodthatthehigh prioe of this graln during the winter has led maany malisters to resort largely to forelgn, whhich has boon delivered on the eastern coast at Z0. to 32s.

London, Monday, March 23, 1857.
LO2flDOO, MONDAY, MARCH 23, 1W.
The House of Lords met on Saturday at 2 o'clock, and, after the Royal assent had been given to sevetal Bills2, the LORD CZANCIxOR~, on behalf of the Royal t,ommisasioners, read a speech, announcing Emx MAJniTY' intention inimediately to dissolve Parliament; preparatory tso that measure he for. iaally prorogued it until the 30th of April.
In the House of Commons, in reply to a question by Mr. T. Duxcoxss,
Lord P AnmsiRow said that, although no overtures, properly so called, had been received from the
ing of NAPLys, an indirect intimatioa had been given that the Neapolitan Government was anxious to know whether, if the KIG were to carry into execution the convention made with the Argentine Confederation, under which the political prisoners were to be banished to that republic, the Governmients of England and France would consider this s a substantial beginning of amoremoderate system. The British Government, he Maid, did not think that snick a clearance of the lTe apo}it an prisons, to be afterwards replenished by fresh arrests, would accomplish the purpose for which diplomatic relations had been broken off.
The noble lord having laid upon the table a treaty concluded with the Emperor of Monooco, said, in answer to Mr. Bow-ym, that the protection of the line of electric telegraph in the Turkish territories was part of the gener system of police established by the Turkish Government in that part of the empire,
The CHANCELLOR of the ExonsHi,xn added that the British Government was in no respect answerable for the construction of the telegraph, or for ,its protection from injury by the Axab tribes.
After some further business, the House vas summoned to the House of Lords, and the Sesion terrainated.
The fourth Parliament of the present reign has
The fourth Parliament of the present reign has now come to an end, and within the next fortnight a new Houso of Commnons will be chosen, which may, according to law, control the destinies of the country for the next seven years. The late Parliament has lived to a fair age, and, if we measure its duration by the importance of events, it may be said to be old. When it was elected the minds of men were stiU occupied with the economical struggle which, after having raged for fifteen years, was about to come to a close. Since that time a great change has passed over the nation. We have emerged into a period when foreign policy has in a great, perhaps an undue measure, engaged the attention of the country. It may truly be said that in 1862, and for several years before, the concens of other nations were of comparatively little interestto the inhabitants of these islands; in,deed, except some feeling for the wrongs of oppressed nationalitivo;vAd some curiosity about the result of French pblitical changes, there was but little attention~ liven to continental Europe, and MOX oni of the tempest which was alreay 'wvering. VWithin a year of the time that Uthi Great ExhibitioiL of 1851-that presumed inaifguaition of general peace-was closed, the faliig 6owers Qf the Whig GovernxneAt yielded before the attacks of its adversaries, &nd Lord DrBnB succeeded to office. Itwas under
his auspices that the late Parlianient was elected.
If it was a bad Parliament-if it fuiledin carx7inggreat measures or affirming great principles,-we cam hardly wonder at the fact. As far as man'a intention went, it was sumnmoned to decide on merely domestic questions; the course of events forced it to administer the affairs of a great European war. So far as the opinions, the principles, and the cries which gave the members their seats are concerned, it was elected on the narrowest possible basis. As often happens, a Government the fault of which was weakness and incapacity vas overthrown by a party which, though even less esteemed by the nationi, made a temporary display of courage and address, and, being untried in office, gave hopes to the somewhat impatient public of administrative capacity. The partisans of Lord DzaBY made the most of this fond delusion. They went to the country, as they would go now, as practical, though not boastful, Reformers, able to carry measures which the Whigs, with all their talking, brought in only to abandon. But it was necessary to keep a semblance of faith with the constituencies. For six years every orator on the Opposition side of the House had been engaged in asserting the great principle of Protection. Up to the year 1850 actual motions for the purpose of undoing the legislation of 1846 had been proposed to the Legislature and more or less supported by the leaders of the party. I these had ceased somewhat to rail at free trade in corn they were still eager to denounce on all occasions the surrender of our maritime supremacy. So, when Parliament was dissolved in the summer of 1852, it was necessary to go tothe countrywith an appearance of Protectionist opinions. The remembrance of those elections willnot easily pass away. Never was there such double dealing on the part of candidates, such simplicity on the part of electors. It need hardly be said that, with the exception of a few, such as composed the select band of 52 some weeks afterwards, there was not a man who stood for a county or borough who did not know that Protection would have to be abandoned, and was not prepared to abandon it. Having obtained neither the renewal of Protection nor any compensatory measure for the agriculturists, the Government of Lord DERBY was defeated and went out of office. The new House of Commons then transferred its wavering allegiance to Lord ABERDn . Then followed the Session of 1853, the best of the late Parliament's existence. The Coalition, as it was called, was composed of a number of politicians eminent as administrators and orators. It was formed amid the applause and gratification of the country, which thought that such an union of all the talents must necessarily produce a strong Government and effective legislation. For a time this expectation was not disappointed. The heads of each department seemed to run a race of energy and application with each other. There was no opposition, for the discredited followers of Lord DXXYR had not courage to raise their heads after a failure so conspicuous as that of the past year. There was a large crop of good measures prepared by the Whigs, but left, with their usual ill-fortune, unachieved. The new Cabinet, therefore, carried Bill after Bill in a manner which considerably added to their authority. While the storm in the East was gathering,-while the fleets of the Allies were anchoring in Besika Bay and Beicos Bay,-while the Vienna Note was being subscribed to and rejected, the people caling out for strong measures, and the Cabinet practising moderation,-some of the most importantpractical measures of late years were carried through Parliament.
The House of Commons might have long remained true to its allegiance to the ABERDEEN Government. But in 1854 mighty events were taldng place. War on its most extended scale had come suddenly on the country. Even Lord Jomf RussET, who had unwilingly abandoned his Reform Bill, was now fulUy convinced that the present was no time for the country's attention to be distracted from the great enterprise which it had undertaken. Soon came the expedition to Sebastopol, the victory of the Alma, followed by that collapse of military administration, of which the world has heard enough. The Government of Lord ABEBDBmr broke up. To do Parliament justice, it did not abandon the Ministry; the Ministry destroyed itself. Lord JoHN RfssELr, after having created complications in the Cabinet, and extruded an excellent colleague from his office that he miight occupy it himself, chose to desert his friends at the critical moment. A Ministerial interregnum followed. Lord Jon9 Russnr., Lord DERBY, and, finally, Lord PAuxERSToN, were called for. The last assumed the office which he still holds. Some of his present opponents still remained his colleagues. But Mr. GLADSTONE, Mr. zEsmEsr, and Sir JAsrEs GRUAs would not assent to the Sebastopol Committee. They resigned, and the Cabinet was formed as it remains at present, after having held office for the last two years.
In 1853 Parliament had passed the Succession Duties Bill, abolished the Advertisement Duty, provided for the diminution and extinction of the Income-tax, and sanctioned several other measures of only less importance. But in 1854 war had begun. This year and the succeeding are remarkable for little in the way of domestic legislation. The Oxford University Bill, the Bill for the Suppression of Corrupt Practices at Elections, and the Regulation of Publichouses, form the chief legislative achievements of the two Sessions. The year 1856 is fresh in recollection. Lord PsALERSTON'S star was still in the ascendant. Under his rule the armies of England had been re-created, the defects of organization rapidly made good, the voice of complaint hushed, the campaign in the Crimea carried to a successful issue, and the enemy exhausted. Russia had made through a neutral Power proposals for peace, and in March, 1856, peace had been signed on terms sufLiciently satisfactory. But the ill fortune of the late Parliament seems still to have pursued it. It was fated that after its first year the Legislature of 1852 should produce little fruit, and accordingly the late Session was passed in contests and delays which have left little
trace in the statute-book. The chief results were the Limited Liabilities Act, the Act for the Reform of the University of Cambridge, and the Act sanctioning the retirement of Bishops. The failure of the Divorce Bill, the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Bill, and the Lords' Appellate Jurisdiction Bill, is a proof how little the nation was able to settle down to the prosaic business of legislation after the excitement of the preceding contest.
In 1857 the Parliament has been struck with a premature death. We could not sympathize with the manner of its birth,-we cannot weep over its grave. It has, indeed, done one good work. It has boldly sustained those who were for boldly carrying on the war. It chafed against the delays of Lord ABnRzjEN, prudent though they may have been; it was indignant at the weakness of a RUSsELL, a GLADSTONE, and a COBDEN, and it stanchly supported Lord PA)znsrTON as long as he was purely a War Mnister. But there our praize must end. The IParliament has shown little aptitude and-littlo desire for domestic legislation-, and of late has plainly tended to transfer its allegiauce from Vthe Minister to those who had deserted and were designing to overthrow him. The country has been all through
,more singlo-mindeQd tharn thl -A&nuWbly which has
beeu the accomnplloe o' io many facions., Let us, Lojpv, then, that it il now send to Weetrhimter a body which' will play a more usefum and a more dignified part.
Lord ELLENBOROUGH'S grandfather, and the
Lord EL NuoRouGvns grandfather, and the founder of his family,! was the. author of many religious and scientific works, and became Bishop of Carlisle. Of his sons, one became Bishop of Elphin, another Bishop of Bath and Wells. His other sons and daughters, auid their numerous progeny, became clergymen or, clergymen's wives, or lawyers or lawyers' wives; and the Ex.rxBoRouGon page of the Peerage contains more civil and ecclesiastidal distinctions than, perhaps, any other. On glaneing down the eye, one notices the names of half-a-dozen episcopal sees, and a long list of diocesan Chancellors, Masters, Prebendaries, Archdeacons, and clergymen innumerable. Then there is the well-known Recorder, and a Custos Brevium of the Court of King's Bench. In the midst of the solemn procession, surrounded by mitres, surplices, wigs of many cuts, and every variety of official costume, except the military, comes his Lordship's immediate progenitor, the celebrated Lord Chief Justice. The great Lord EuBonouosr, if the present possessor of the title will allow him to be so called, was a great and strong man, and no one ever laid so strong a grasp on his country's most valuable institutions. The story is still extant that when his son and heir, the present Lord, vas still a boy, he was out riding one day, when he received news of the lapse of a sinecure worth 6,0001. a-year, and,
being warned thereby of the uncertainty of humanlife, he immediately took off his hat, and, laying upon it a slip of paper, wrote thereon the nomination of his son. This may or may not be true, but the son to this day receives more by virtue of his father's nomination than if he had annexed a kingdom or two to our Indian empire. Most of our readers will set down the Earl of ErxasloBouGH as singularly fortunate in his genealogical tree. It is entirely official and literary, and is a specimen of the highly artificial or Chinese system of society. It must have taken many hundred examinations, degrees in arts, divinity, and law, ordinations, consecrations, enthronizations, promotions, preferments, institutions, inductions, courses of study, and procees of all sorts, except naval or military, to make up such a family. In China they count nobility forwards-not backwards, but what would a well-conducted, studious young Mandarin, give for such a posterity ! In the abstract, and on every right view, it is really the most respectable ancestry, as far as it goes, in the Peerage. Yet, strange to say, we believe that his Lordship's sorest trial, the one " crook in his lot," is the strictly useful and pacific avocations of his forefathers and relatives. Were it possible to make an exchange he woald gladly " swop" the whole for one great warrior. To be sure, his Lordship does his best to atone for his legal and ecclesiastical blood, but it is still in him, and he may some day break out into a saint or a contented civilian. At present, the struggles of his own nobler instincts against the base nature of his family honours and the customs of peace are aptly represented in his crest. It is a cock, gules, chained round the neck, and charged on the breast with a rmitre or; when, therefore, Lord ELLENBOBOUGH tries to soar, or even flap his wings, he finds himself chained to tho ground; when he swells his throat for a crow he is choked with the family
mitre.
It is but common justice to bear this in mind in Lord ELEsBOnOuIGH'S case, since it accounts for much that would otherwise surprise us. When in Indit. he was always lauding the military at the expense of the civil service, and creating among his friends the same uneasiness as a young lady does when she is too much taken with red coats; he was, in fact, only restoring the equilibrium of nature. That just and modest power may be said to hate excess as much as she abhors a vacuum. Lord ELrTTzBnoaouo has to counteract siingle-handed the accumulated peacefulness of a family surcharged with so many ecclesiastics and 1awyers. So unwarlike a brood may be compared to a negative cloud, which creates a thunderstorm by its want of electricity. The true theory of the case is, not that Lord ELLNBoRouosH loves war, but that wherever he moves the military element rushes into him, as the salient point of a vast pacific mass. In other words, he is a war " conductor." Though he seems to make the explosion and the report, his own part in it is strictly negative. Thus in the recent debates, when his Lordship could never mention "Dr. " BowitNG" without giving vent to his disgust, no one supposed that he was personally a lover of peace. It was a case of electric collision-Sir Joml BownRn the least warlike agent of a war, Lord ELLNBOROUGH the least pacific point of an eminently peaceful family. By the same rule we mlust interpret the succession of thunder-claps in his address to the British electors on Friday night in the House of Lords. He fire up at the statement that Lord PAI,MERSToN hadbrought a glorious war to a satisfactory peace, not so much because the peace was unsatisfactory as because the war was not glorious enough. The same may be said of a succession of loud reports on the Estimates. The first duty he urges upon Parliament is, " more espe"c ially to be economical in those parts of the ex" penditure which have no connexion with naval " or military purposes." He goes through all the hateful particulars in which we have latterly been launching out. They are Public Buildings and Palaces, Royal Parks and Pleasure-gardens, Printing and Stationery, Edueation, Science and Art, Convicts, and, by way of a elimax, " special and " temporary objects." For our part, we could add to the list. We have already done so. If we differ from his Lordship, it is that we don't think it of much use simply to explode into notes of indignation at the increasing totals under these several heads. They call for a deliberate and careful treatment, and we certainly cannot think much the worse of them simply because they are neither naval nor military.
The rules for all public expenditure are the same as for personal and domestic expenditure-domeatic rather than personal, because in the last mere caprice is allowable. We must treat the nation as a numerous, growing, and still increasing family, With an improving income froTa various sources, with some necessities, many wants, and perhaps more temptations. In this case we use common
senso, or, at least, ought to use it. We consrider fiDrt the facts of the case; what we wish to do and can do ; what'are the objects worth trouble and expense; and what we have the means for. Above all, we apply the old and universal doctrine of the golden mean-neither too much nor too little. So we conceive it the first duty of the Legislature to bear in mind all the wants of such a community as ours, and to provide that all shall be met in their due proportion. We shall not go the rouvnd of all the wants of a people, but confine ourselves to those which Lord ELLENBoRoUGH conceives we are spending too much money upon. We certainly are behind all other countries of the Old World in Public Buildings and Palaces. Buck-
ingham Palace is not' too large or too goigeous. St. James's is not too capaeious or t grand for our Royal receptioxs. Teia*iji
is not overdone-with Royal residences, whemQueen I VIout.rA has had to build andmaintaintwe st herl own private expense. - We haYenot larger pic-
tealleries hic auterel fill; Indeed, whethrifor the higher classe#, Vwo masy expect to meet ,sometimes in the presence of Royalty, or for the people at large, who may wish for a more comraon ground, it cannrot be said there is too much or too 'splendid accommodation. Then, as for Parks and Pleasure-grounds, when. it is considered how much a man often wants for himself and a few friends, the two millions of the metropolis have not too much green award, and wood, and shirubbery, and parterre within easy reach of them. Close together on the West are the Royal Parks and Gardena ; on the North-west is the Regent's Park, and at the extreme East Victoria Park, and at the extreme South-west Battersea Park; but by the rule of analogy the North, South, and South-east might be supposed to wait Parks of their own; as, indeed, they do, If the annual expenditure on auch points increases it is because the population increases, and the difficulty of maintaining Parks and Gardens in the heart of it increases. But what we insist on is, tha7w'e have not too much of the thing; on the
contrary, too little. Then, as for Education, the! grant is open 'to zerious objections, for the system is very irresponsible; few members of Parliament know anything about it, and help is almost exclusively given to those who are most able to take care of themselves. But there is not too much education in the country; there are not too many children at school; the instruction given is not too comprehensive,
sound, ref&ned, or exact; on the contrary, we I
beiieve there is great deficiency in these respects. I Then, as for our convicts, we have not too ample provision even for them, when we. have lately been turning them loose on society, for mere want of penal colonies ind prison room; at the rate of several thousands a-year. ln all these instances, and laore, though the expenditttre may be increas-. ing, it is not because we do too much, and the cure is to be found rather in a more judicious than
in a more thrifty expenditure. I
In all theso matters it is the best economy in the enid to make " saving" not the principal, but
a secondary consideration. A man whose mind is' always bent upon saving will be sure to do things
imperfectly and insufficiently-to leave errors and' arrears, and to provoke a certain reaction towards a lavish expenditure. Every politician of but 30 years' experience must rememnber several reactions on the subject of economy, and as sure as day and night succeed one another there will be the same number in the next 30 years. The object in each several instance should be not to economize, but to do certain things well, and as cheaply as is compatible with the primary object of efficiency. In this country, as compared with other countries, there is a large, but, as we conceive, a not very difficult question, between the proper duties of the I State and the locality, or the subdivision of the State, in the discharge of certain responsibilities, The difficulty is brought within obvious limits by the truth, which all must admit, that it is the duty of the State to do what it considers will best contribute to success. Where letting alone will really answer the'purpose better than any interference whatever, that is reason enough for letting alone; but to maintain the dogma of letting alone even when it evidently leads to ill results, or to none at all, is heartless pedantry and a mere default of government. A State ought steadily to keep in view aU that wants doing, and do it as well as can be done; sometimes interfering with a strong hand and a full one; sometimes encouraging or directing; often letting alone; but always taking that course which promises the best for succees. The very worst thing is to let that remain undone which ought to be done by somebody or other. There can be no excuse for entire omission, though omissions there certainly are, many and great, in our social system. We cannot tLerefore join in a cry of economy which points simply to letting things alone, or to starving actual peace for the sake of pomsible war. Ours is a rich nation, and in many respects a liberal one, so it ought to discharge its duties richly and liberally. It may do these things economically, but not insufficiently or meanly, though it need not establish more sinecures of 6,0001. a-year.
How shall we get Mr. CORDEN'S speeches into a
How shall we get Mr. CoBDEh's speeches into a small compass ? They are very clever, very lively, and we dare say not a bit too long for their respective audiences In fact, we ourselves would a good deal rather read them than many others which come under our eyes; but what are we to do when it comes to our own turn to reply, and when we are obliged to put all we have got to say into half-a-dozen paragraphs ? Here is Mr. COBDzw arguing tooth and nail that the Chinese affair is all wrong; that Lord PALMERSTON is not a true Liberal, that he is not entitled to demand the confidence of the country, and that T7h 7tmes is at imue with itself in coinciding with a Minister whose policy it formerly disapproved. Well, if all the questions before the country could be disposed of as concisely as the last of these points, we should have easy work of it, for surely it is rather hard that Mr. CoBDnE should talk about our inconsistency in such a matter when in the very same speech and at the very same moment he justifies by the hour together the cooperation of any parties, however discordant, when their objects are found to agree, and establishes his own title to act with Lord Dx3y, Mr. DisRAELra, and the whole Conservative party whenever le thinks proper.
And now as to Lord PAiGMsrnToN's position and proceedings. MIr. COBDEN says we are invited by the dissolution of Parliament to make his Lordship a despotic Minister, to fall down and worship him, and so forth. The country is no more atder such an obligation now than at any other dissolution of Parliament. Lord PsiBsr ow has simply done what every Minister under similar circumstances bas done and will do; he has appealed to the country to ascertain whether an adverse vote will be ratified by the country or not, and the course, indeed, was even more than commonly obvious, for the Parliament had been elected under the auspices of the opposite party, and it was in the fifth year of its existence. Lord PALMERSTON goes to the country for support; so did Sir ROBsxuT PEEL; so did Lord DnaBy; and so, if he were in office, would Mr. CoBDEn. That is the support to which a constitutional Minister would naturally turn; that is the confidence which he must necessarily invite. If he obtain it he is confirmed in the power of government, but this power will be neither more nor less in Lord PALMRESTON'S hands than in the hands of any other Minister whose policy has received the sanction of the popular voice. There is no " worship" in the matter. We are not going to bind ourselves hand and foot for Lord PALmZuSToN any more than anybody else, or to release him from any particle of that vigilance or controtto which a free country should subject an Ahdministration. The exceptional feature of the case is not -in the crisis itself, but in the colour which Mr. COBDrw has given it and the light in which he has chosen to view it. Nobody wants to fall down before the Prime Minister or invest him with greater consideration than S'ny of his predecessors. He is dimply the head of an Administration *hich brought the country b.onourably out £of a. e*ly. ad destrict'ive -war; he has encountered in the Houtse of -Comnns, by a sumall' majorit, aioteequivalent to a Mote of-censure on; prooeedings in rhich le thbinks the country will proIbly tre -with hi
and not. with his opponents-; and he appeals to the country accordingly to ascertain the point ;-that
But why is one single name put forward insteaa of a " platformn"-why don't we have a "cpolicy T' Why, the policy of a Government is reflected in its acts, and the Government and policy are known in all political vocabularies by the name of the Premier. But why is Lord PAxzRsToN Premier, and bow comes he to be the head of the Liberal party, without, as Mr. COBDEN declares, having a bit of true Liberalism about him ? The question ought to be asked of the Liberal party itself. The headship of a political party is not conferred upon a man by his own vote, as a good many politicians have learnt. Two voices go to such a bargain. We rather think it is enongh to say that Lord P.&xERSTON does lead the Liberal party, and to point to the fact. If he is a bad leader, that is their concern, and Mr. COBDEN had better enlighten them. AU his arguments, in fact, apply not to Lord PArM?.ssToN'S present position, but to his position before the Chinese affair was heard of. If he is all that Air. CoBDEN describes, the vote ought to have been not a mere vote about affairs in the Canton River, but a regular want of confidence vote; directed against the Premier and his policy. We are not concerned to defend his Lordship at all points; we have differed from him often enough, and shall probably do so again; but it is plain anyhow that he is just as good a Minister now as he was when no one could be found better, and when the country was very glad to have him.
As to the Chinese rupture, the very last thing that ought to be said. about the matter is what wo sometimes hear,-that the case has not been taken on its merits, or that people have not entered into the details of the argument. Mr. COBDEN himself confesses that in the House of Coomons the study given to the papers on the subject was particularly notable, and he might have recollected when he said so that the result of this study was to yield only a bare majority against the policy of Sir JoHN BOWRING. But, though the public in general cannot be expected to wade through Parliamentary documents, yet we venture to say that what with the debates in both Houses and the comments upon them, the popular acquaintance with the subject, even in its technicalities, is vastly more extensive than usual. The isystem of registering vessels at Hongkong, the actual quality of the protection possessed under such system by the Arrow, the circumstances under which her flag was torn down, the measures adopted to obtain reparation for the offence, and all the'proceedings which followed, have been so dinned into the public ear from one side or another that the very names of the persons concerned are household words among us. We ssay, however, that there is and must always be a conception of such matters formed by the popular understanding, which is not the less likely to be just because drawn from the broad impressions received by the common sense of the nation. Besides all that is written on the Chinese quarrel there is a good deal which cannot be written or told, except by implication, even in the most voluminous despatches. There is the general spirit and temper of parties arising out of ,their relative positions; there are the conditions created by the actual situation of affairs-conditions which may either render it necessary to resent a slight offence or possible to overlook a grave one; and there are the probabilities suggested by the known dispositions of the characters or communities concerned. Now, we afirm that on every one of these points aU the ascertainable facts tell for the justification of Sir Jonx BownRio. He himself was a professed lover of peace, and a disciple pretty nearly of the Manchester School, while of Admiral SExv1rBou's judgment nobody says a word, except in praise. Yet these two authorities, as well as Consul PABIEs and all others, concurred in thinking it necessary to resort to force, and not precipitately either, for the despatches show us that they spent days in deliberation, and that YzH had ample time to make amends. In the next place, these proceedings of the authorities have the approval of all those who by their residence on the spot are cognizant of the numerous points which it is so diffcult to describe. There is no exception in this respect. Lord GRANVILLE told the House of Lords on Monday evening last that in supporting our officials at Canton Government was borne out by the testimony not only of every merehaut, but "of every Christian mission in China." Granted that our countrymen may carry something of the pride and assumption of Englishmen with them to Canton-what is there on the other side ? The most arrogant yet truckling spirit in the world-a spirit of such cherished and traditional animosity against us as to drive us into a fixed corner for our very dwellings; a spirit so notorious for what Mr. COBDEN himself calls its " turbulence and insubordination " as to be pleaded in justification of the most insulting conduct towards Europeans, and the non-fulfilment even of a solemn treaty ;. while, if we come to strike a balance between Englishmen and Cantonese, and see which is the likelier to give offence, no one can fail to remark that if we agree with Chinamen at four out of five ports, and get into disturbance at the fifth alone, there is a strong presumption, from the very nature of the case, that the inhabitants of this particular city must be more in fault than we. This is a plain view of the case, and we are certainly not surprised at its finding a good deal of favour.

THE COLLIERY EXPI,osION? NEAH BA1uNSLEr.- DOuring the past week little has occurred at the LundhiU Colliery calling for mention. On the evening of Saturday week,after long and mature considertion, the managing engineers determined to renew the current of water into the pit until Wednesday. On tho evening of the latter day the engineers again met, andaftera prolonged consltation, during vhich the temperature of the water in the pit and other facts were Iid before them, they decided to continue the influx of water into the pit until this day (Monday). It having been announced that operations for em ying the pit would in all probability be commenced on *ednesday, a number of the widows and relatives of the men who have perished assembled around the offices of the proprietors to &wait the result of the consultation. At the conclusion Mr. Nicholas Wood inrformed them that the water ia the Up-cast shaft not being of a uniform heat-it was 61deg. Fahrenbeit at the bottom, aDd G6deg. st the top-it was clear that the fire was stiUl snouldering in the pit, and asit would be extremely unsafe to draw out the water] until the fire was quite extinguished, himself an d the other engineers had decided to continue the influx of water; but they might rely upon it that not a moinent would be lost in emptying the pit and recovering the bodies, after it became safe to do so. The announcement crated much lamentation on the part of the women, and gave riso to a very distressing scene. Air. Morton, the Government inspector, stAted that the engineers were of opinion that vhen the water should have risen to the height of 60 feet up the shaft the fire would be extinguised, and that there was little doubt as-to-its reaching that height by today. On Saturday ths Water bad reached considerably above 50 feet, but it is doubtful whether to-day the tom.,erature of the water will be rufflcienvt uniform to aeitify the conclusion that the- fire is extinguished. In cso it does, all prepaTations havitig been rnade, the drawing out ,of the water will, no doubt, be at anco proceeded with. The
loroner's inquiry was ramedU on Thursda and Frida; but no evidence of special imnportance wa adduoed. Sn

THE DISSOLUTION.-The Parliament of Lord
THE DrSsoLurixO.-The Parliament of Lord Derby is dissolved. It was fall time. Five years is no bad lease of political life. The dissolation has come one day earlier than wo hoped for last week. The proclamation forcallingthe new Parliament followed immediately the prorogation of the old. Tho writs were sent off last night to overy constitunocy in the tUnited Kingdom. They are now sent direct to every returning officer, instead of to the High Sheriff of the county, as before, to be distributed by him. This now arrangement saves time and confusionr, and brings the elections for the different parts of the empure within a ahort apace of each other. The horough elections will tale place at the end of the week, three clear days1 and not more than six, being allowed after the proclamation by the returning officer. In the counties the elections must take place after eight das and before 12 days from the receipt of the writ. Tis i
quick work. The coalitions do not like it. They would rather boe allowed to keep on their interminable and ueless talk for two or three weeks longer. However, they have all made their election speeches in the Lords and Com. mons, and they must now attend to receive judgment and execution. It will prove, in the vrords of Lord John Russell, a very " penal dissolution" for many an ex-honourable gentleman. Lord Derby may see already, in tho list we sub. 3in, how far Lis rhetoric in the lords on Monday night
as prevailed over the country gentlemen of England. The foUowing Tory gentlemen-who aoted with Mr. Disraeli, as the phase goes, or, rather, under that very brilliant gentlo. man of Eastern descent-have retired from their places, and their " party" have handed over the vacant seats to Liberal country gentlemen of England;-

NUItDEROUS ABrYAY 2WRAP. BARusLLy.-One of the most murderous attacls which have occurred in this neighbourhood for some time, and which, it is to be feared, will bo attended with fatal results, was perpetrated on Friday night, under the following circumstances: -About half-past 11 o'clock, as Police-constable Robert Walker (a newly-appointed officer under Colosel Cobbel, stationed at Wombwdll, was going his round at Smithley, About a mile from the Lundi Colliery, he heard some men in a field in which were a number of sheep belonging to Mr. Bashforth, farner, of Aldam-house. Havng no doubt as to the intentions of the men, he got behind a hedge in an Adoining field, where he could partly see what was going on. Ve had only been there a short time when be saw tbree men drive the flock of sheep into the cormer of the field close to wbere he was concealed, a short hedgo only dividing them. Having caught two of the sbeep, one of the party asked, "Where shall we stick them?" Another rep led, '- Lot us take them down to the low end of the field,' which they proceeded to do. The constable baving heard the answer made at once prepared to attack the men and endeavour to capture some of them. For this purpose be took off his cost-bolt And latern, and followed them at the other aide of the hedge. On arriving at the bottom of the field he could only see two men, who had the sheep on the ground, and who were stooping over them. He struck one of them a blow with a heavy walking-stick, and the other be succeeded in handcuEffing, Another ma, who was no doubt of the three he first saw, came up and gave a. whistle. The signal was responded to, and five more men inshed to the spot, when a desperate struggle ensued, tho men being armed with life-preservers and butcher's knves. Walker's stick having broken, he sei7ed a life-preserver from one of the villsins, which he used with good effect. For a short time the constable withstood tho attack, dwuing which the parties in tbo scuffle rolled over the low hedge into an adjoining field. The knives and life-pre. servers were then used most unmercifully, t1ll Walker was completely overpowered and rendered Insensible. The men, including the one with the handcuffs on, then made off. Onthe policeman recovering he, with geat difficulty managed to crawl to the farm of Mr. Walton, about cn 3 ards distant. He was immediately conveyod to his residence at Wombwell, and medical aid called in, when it was found that two of his fingers were entirely out off, and a third was hanging by the skin, which was afterwards amputated. The two fngers were found in the field where the attack cocurred, having been severed by a knife. He was bruised and cut nearly all over his body having seven severe wounds on the head, all inflicted with kniives, his face cut in a shocking Manner, and one of his *ouldaet dislocated. He niow lies in a very preearious #$Vb,

wr ra
On Saturday night Mr. Horsfall, M.P., and Mr. Charles Turner, the Conservative candidates, appeared before a conliderable body of electois in Pitt-strect Ward.
Mr. HossFALL, M.P., referring to the Chinese vote, said, Lord Pahuerston was right on that question, *nh the motion of Mr. Cobden ..ught to have been zejected by the Houge of Comuions. For himself, ihe repeated, if returned he would not go to the B?ouse to be the representative of or to vote for any set -of men, but that he should consider every question -that would be proposed, and give an honest vote according to hisconscience. If Lord Pahuerston's measures were such as he could approve he should have his support; but if he brought forward himself, or through any member -of his Uovermnent, su;h as Mr. Lowe, a biUl to deprive Liverpool of her town dues, was he thea to .-spport Lord Palmerston ? (" No, no 1") He was opposed to the grant to Maynooth and to vote by
aoCt-his objection to the latter beiig that, if recognized %s a principle, it would be introduced into the House of Commons, and constituencies would uot know how -heir representativesvoted. He was opposed, he said, to Sir John Pakington's Education Bill, because it proposedto seolarie the whole system ofeducation, whereas tho highest authority they could have had said " The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom."
In reply to an elector,
3Mr. HoRSAiLL said he was opposed to throwing open the liquor trade, nd was in favour of Mr. Hardy's Beer Bill.
MLtr. TURNER also addressed the meeting, confning his temarks chie'fy to local question-, and to matters personal to himself. He was opposed to the Maynooth endowinent, -to a system of secular education alone, to the opening of places of smusement on the Sabbath, and to the proposition to throw open the liquor trade to unrestricted com.etition.
of confidence in Messrs. Horsfall aud Turner were It is expected that the nomination in this borough wil Lake place on Friday, and the electioo on Saturday next.
The canvass for Mr. Ewart, the Liberal candidate, is said -to be of the most promiising description.
MAlNCHESTER.
On Saturday morning a meeting was held of the requiSitionists to Messrs. Lowe and Potter at the corn-exchange. Machester, for the purpose of withdrawing Mr. Lowe and -of substituting a new candidate in his Place. Between 1,000 and 1,500 persons were present, and Mr. Alderman ellUd was again called to the chair.
The CHAIR3iANA having opened the proceedings,
hlr. HEUGII said a deputation had been to London to 'Wait upon Mr. Lowe with the requisition so soon as 4,000 signatures had been attached, which was a number -equal nearly to the number of electors who polled for .hlr. Denman at the last election. When they met Mr. Lowe he had expressed his anxiety to come down to repregsent Manchester, but his friends at Kidderminster had sent -an urgent deputation to him, and he had felt himself bound in honour to them, on Wednesday evening last, to declare -that, if elected, he would sit for Kidderminster; therefore ho could not accede to the reqiisition. They were greatly mrprised that Mr. Lowe, having g ven that pledge on Wed. inesday evening, did not give them earlier information of his decision. an the present crisis of the country, consider-ing that the feeling in Manchester was in favour of the _rliGY of protecting our commerce, it was their daty
do what they could to support that policy. There was a man present (Sir J. Potter) who had already a4ccepted their requisition (cheers) ; and there was another uman who had now consented to come forward and fi"ht 'this battle against the dictation of the gentlemen at Newal's. buildings, and against a coalition in the House of Com.
1nons, in favour of the policy of Lord Palmerston, and that was Mr. James AspinaU Turner. (Loud cheers.)
Mr. J. GARNairr moved, " That James Aspinall Turner, 7sq, be placed in nomination along with Sir John Potter for the snffrages of this constituenoy."
Mr. M.ULCOLII Ross seconded the motion, which was ;dso supported by Mr. OLIVER HEISWOOD.
The C"AIRMAN, in submitting the resolution, said they Vere in such a position that one active hour was worth two -talking hours. If Mr. Turner had acceded to the request of hia friemds his name would have been before the electors long ago. He had now acceded to their earnest wishes in a 2noment of difficulty, and contrary to his own inclinations, and that constituted a double claim upon their gratitude. He felt persuaded that MIr. Turner would never disgrace them, and therefore he had great pleasure in putting the 1notion.
The motion was then put, and was carried all but inanimously.
Mr. TuRiEBR then addressed the meeting. He had no wish to intrude himself unon the Manchester community. He came into Mancheater, in 1819, as poor a youth as any within its limit-, though of respectable family, for his father had become insolvent, and he himself in struggling to retrieve the bunsiness also became insolvent; but he had since naid his debts. He had risen by honourable conduct and industry. If it was the decided opinion of the majority of the -electors that the present members should be returned again he should not be disappointed; but he believed they did not represent the feelings of the great majority of the electors. He and Sir John might he undistinguished compared with Bright and Gibson, but at a11 events he thought they knew as much of commerce as Mr. Gibson. For Mr. Bright he sympathized, because he was suffering from less of health, and he believed him to have been a -valuable member of the House of Commons, but he did not Qthink the same of MIr. Gibson. He did not intend to detain the meeting; he did not wish to come under a variety of pledges as to his conduct if he went to the House of Commons; but there was no man in that assembly would have a xnore sincere desire to do his duty, to contribute to the pro-
of the country, or to aunp port their local interests. He had always hdmired the conduct of Mr. Brotherton, and, if elected, should endeavour to follow his example. He would touch on politics lightly, but he was a friend to progress. He Vas asincerereformer of every abuse, and would support every measure that might tend to promote the progress of the country. Ho felt it would be considered a great objection that he and Sir J. Potter were both of the same religion
muitarianien), and that not a popular one; but he would -always respect the religions opinions of other sects. He shoud never attempt to pull down the church, but would try to promote the cause of civil and religious liberty. ALoud cheers.)
Sir J. FOrrEt said he was there in consequence of a requisition signed by 4,000 electors, not obtained by paid can. vassers. He had taken part in Manchester in every active xaovement and in accepting this invitation he had no personal ambition to serve. He should desire no support but upon Liberal principles. He had not, as had been said, dishonoured his father, but if Sir T. Potter had now been alive Manchester would not have been dictated to by Newal'sluildings. (Cheers.) He had not left his old friends, but they had left him. He believed Mr. Bright had rendered important services, which would never be forgotten; there was no change of opinion in that respect, but there was a -change in the opinions of the electora as to the foreign policy. Be thought the presentmembers, instead of caviflingagainst Government, ought to have given them an honest and independent support. Ho should, if elected, go to Parliament as an independent member, and would snpport Lord Palmerston in every just and necessary war. He would never permit the flag of England to be dishonoured. He would not support any Government unless they were prepared to carry out progressive reform. (" Hear," and cheers.) He woald only go to the House as a reformer, and was willing to take slp the opnioins expressed by Mr. Gibson. Although he did not thinkl the ballot would be as useful as was expected, he was willing to give it a triaL. (A Voice-"You won't do for the Tories.") He would endeavour to support the principles of civil and religious liberty. The decision of that meeting had been the greatest gratification to him, as he should prefer rather to stand or fall by the side of his friend Mr. Turner than by the side of any member of Her Majesty's Government. He was not an eloquent man, but he was honest. He had done nothing he had need to be ashamed of before that community. If they returned him he would endeavour to dischaxgo faithfully, honestly, and actively any duties which might be imposed upon him, .(Loud cheers.)
A WORKING MAN, here said he wished to put a questionI to the candid4tes, but the Chairman advised him to attend. the ward meetings, and decided against it; and ar. Heu h told the man that, not being a requisitionist, he had no right at the meeting.
Another WORKItN;G hfAy said he wished to warn the committee that conduct like this would not do. He was mot a voter for Bright and Gibson, but there were many -electors wavering and undecided, and he would caution the -Committee that with them it would not do to carry things with isuch a high hand.
The meeting concluded by a vote of thanks to the chair. mian.
At a meeting of leading Conservatives held in Man-chester on Friday, Ur. James Crossley in the chair, It was rosolred,-
"That whi'e this meeting doe, net censider that the general policy 'fshe CooserAetire party in this city is Iavolved in the course which Certain individual members, acting under exceptiona i cicum. tancs, have thought it proper to slopt in retereno to the Present contest, this meeting Is of opinion that it is not desirable for the Con. servative prty, as such, to pledge self at Present to any course of action"
COVENTRIY.
The Right Hon. E. ELLCc, one of the sitting members for -his borough, addressed a meeting of bis constituents on Paturday afrernoon from the balcony of the Craven Arms.
After referring at some length to the administrativeefforts ef the Cabinets of Lord Derby andLordAberdeen,andpointing eout the difficult circumstances under which Lord Paimerston
UnUettook the goVernment of the country, Mr. Ellie went on to say that as soon as the present Parliament met the nmost bitter hostility was displayed towards the Premier by -those men who had mismanaged our affairs during the time of tho war; and of this feeling other parties in the House -took advantage. Mr. Disraeli brought forward a motion -,which necessitated the Government to provide taxes before they knew for what those taxes vrere required. The result wa that the budget was produced in haste. Against this l r. Disraeli and Mr. Gladstone brought forward, the one a STory and the other a Peelite budget. He (Mr. Ellice) did
not see *my great difference in the budgets. Whatever difference tf-ee was proved to him that Sir G. C. Lewis -ws the best financier of the tbree. Scareely had this ques. -lion been decided when that of the Chinese war came before -the House. It was necessary to pull Iord Palmerston -down, aud nothing would serve so well as to accom.plish it about a matter with which he had ;nothing to do. He (M&r. Elle) would first allude to the -origin of the war, he would then say how far he thoughtthe suthorities in China wero right in the course they pursued, and would finally give his reasons for au pOrtin Lord Palinerston ia the decision at which he hadarriv: in the matter. In the first place, the disputes had been going on ever since the treaty with China was signed in 1842. The Chinese, an odd people, hated their best customers. It was not Po 'with us, but it was with them. Our peopls at C0nton numbered about 300Q The first decided deQmoastration against us wwa made about the be.

ginning of last July. Tho town was tion ldedvwth offers of rewards for th& heads of the barbarhn foreigners. On the 4th of July an English nerchant was murdered, and soon after a French missionary was torture r and Ctl to pieces. Varions insults and petty vexations werealso offered s, and this at the hands of a rmzn who, having sub. dued a rebe lioninthe province of which lhe was governor, Put 70,000 persons to death. He was, then, in tome mea-. sure, A d an to be feared. The dispute went on till the 8th of October, when the Chinese authorities boarded the Arrow, and insulted our flag. Now, he did not think Sir 3. Bowring was wrong in taking immediate steps for avenging that insult. Hedaia think, however, that it would, perhaps, have been a more prudent course to make reprisals, and then wait for instructions from home before proceeding further. Bnt they could not in England judge properly of the circnustances of the case; it was easy to say coolly what ought to be done at a distance from the scene of danger. There was no man so wise as be who knew all the facts of the case. If there was any one who, in the difficult circumstances in which he was placed, deserved consideration, it wasSirJohn Bowring. Hehadbeen complainedof for taking the part of the Chinese, and for the prevention of smuggling. It had also been matter of dissatisfaction with many English merchants that he had enforced payments to the Chinese to which they were clearly entitled. When it was considered that the ferocious Governor Yeh was opposed to him, it could not be matter for wonder that he ado ted strong measures to save the lives of the 300 of his feliowcountrymen who resided at Canton. The right. hon. gentle. man here wenb into details respecting the earlier life of Sir John Bowring, stating that they were together pupils of Jeremy Bentham, who endeavoured to inculcate the principle of the greatest happiness to the greatest number. Sir John Bowring had, moreover, been seoretary of the Peace Society. Was he a man volantarily and ewith malice prepense to engae in an unnecessary war? Sir Michael Soymour, too, was one of the most prudent men in the service, and Sir John Bowring had no power to command him to employ his forces - it was entirely at his discretion whether he did so or no. Mr. E.ace concluded by stating that the vote of the Tories in the House of Commons was given with a view to throw Lord Palmerston out of office. He supported his Lordship because it was desirable that the Liberal ranks should remain unbroken. He dtd not believe that any man of sense would for a moment hesitate to say whether Lord Palmerston ought to have repudiated the acts of the agents of his Government in the East. He entirely acquitted his colleague, Sir Joseph Paxton, of any hostility towards Lord Palmnerston. He had no doubt whatever that the vote given by that gentleman was perfectly conscientious. Sir Joseph bad always stood by him to maintain the rights of the inhabitants of Coventry, and if they had voted in opposition to each other they had done so on questions of policy, and not on questions of principle. (Loud cheers.)
SHEFFIELD.
Mr. Overend having announced himself as a candidate a crowded meeting was held in the Town-hall, Sheffield, on Friday night, to hear the two members. The hall and the passages were so crowded as to cause much interruption in the earlier part of theproceedings. The utmoet enthusiasm prevailed, and the members were received with thunders of applause. Alderman R. B. Hoole was calied to the chair.
Mr. WILLrAsi FIsnER, presented an address of confidence in the members, which had been signed by 15,000 persons.
MIr. ROnBUC};, whio was received with loud cheers, said, I ought, at the commencement of what I have to address to ou, to return my best thanks to the gentlemen who have signed this address. They onlygive me and my colleague credit for that which we really deserve. (Cheers.) We have sought your favour by doing our duty as your representatives, and, so doing, we have received your appausc. For that I thank you. Sir, I look upon myself as born under an unfortunate star. I, Sir, am by nature of a somewhat indolent dlispostion, and Iam very much inclined to peace. But it has so happened that I have been ever at work and ever at war. My life has been one long contest-a political contest. I had hoped that by labour I should by this time have attained to the harbour of peace. I had hoped in the evening of my days to have been saved the trouble of a popular and very vehement election. I had hoped that Iand my colleague-for speaking of myself, I speak of him (cheers)liaving done our duty in that position in which you placed us, and I believ-e that we have done it with some advantage to you-I had hoped we should have been releved on the present occasion from this contest. But, Sir, I have lived to be disappointed, and I am now told that the gentlemen of Sheffield leave my side. (" Not all of them." Cheers.) But still, Sir, in looking around me I do find an absence or familiar faces,-men who I thought were my friends on public grounds, and they say that they forget a hfe of service in consequende of one vote. (Cheers.) I do not believe that assertion. I believe that that accident was sought for, that they endeavoured to find a cause of contplaint, and that they were glad to find one. (Cheers.) Sir, before I go into the statements I have to make on this occasion I wish to say somewbaf of my learned friend and opponent. (Cheers.) He has said, Sir, that he is my friend. I accept that statement. Far be it from me to introduce into political strifs any rancour. I wish to be on good terms with my learned friend, and if I have given him any pain I humbly beg his pardon. He has thought fit to findfault with the majority of the House of Commons, and in return I find fault with him. (Cheers and laughter.) He complains that I called him a Derbyite. I am sorry that memoryis so fleeting. I remember the year 1852. Iremember at that time that my hon. friend appeared as a Conservative. I also remember that at that time Lord Derby was in office. Now Lord Palmerston i8inpower. (Cheers.) Iknow that has a very great effe^t upon some minds. I am sure that it has none upon my learned friend's. (Laughter.) I suppose however, that he has changed his opinions, because in 1852 they were not thoroughly made up; but in 1857 he changed them. So in 1862 he may change them again. Now he is of my opinion; then he may be of the opinion of my hon. friend and colleague. In 1852, in a placard in my
psession, he said, "En everything I am opposed to
Roebuck; "but in 1857 he says, " In everytbing I am of the same opinion as Mr. Roebuck." (Cheers.) Now, Sir, my colleague and myself have for five years represented Sheffield. ln that time a great number of important questions have come before Parliament, aud upon the whole we have won the good opini.n of our constituents. Upon one occasion, indeed, I did more; I won not only your good opinions, but I won tho gond opinion of my country by the services I renderedtoEngland on the occasion of the Crimean expedition. But there camte a time at which it was supposed I and my colleaguo had given two votes that had created a great disposition in the people of Sheffield toquaneolwith us. One wasthe vote we gave upon Mr. Disraeli's motion on. the badget, and the other upon Mr. Cobden's motion on the Chinese war. Now., upon the budgetI will saythis; we believed that the people of England in 1852 had been taxed to a point beyond which it ought. not to go; 52,000,0001. were paid for the business of our Government. Of this about 26,000,0001 went to pay the debt; the other 26,000000l. went to carryon the ordinarybusinessofthe Government. In 1857, in a time of peace we found the expenditure increased 12.000,000l., very neariy one-half of the whole amount expended upn the public businessin 1852. Nowv, I speak for my lon. riend and myself when I say we thought this to be a greatly exaggerated increase, and that we should be doing a good service to thepublic if we referred back the budget to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in order that he might reconsider the expenditure and cut it down. Therefore wve voted in favour of Mr. Disraei'smotion on that ground and on that ground alone. Upon that ground we are said to nave lost the confidence of the people of Sheffield. ("No, no.") Then comesthe next question,namelytheChinese -atrocities I wiU call them. Upon this Mr. Cobden moved the House of Commons to this effect-that the papers laid upon the table did not justify the conduct pursued by our officials in China in the case of the Arrow. That was the proposition, and that is the proposition I have now to deal with. Now, I believe that in the public mind there is a great mistake upon this matter. Upon this matter of the Arrow what occurred ? It appeared that to China we had sent ont the secretary of the Peace Society. I say that in the hearing of may hon. friend. (Laughter.) He was plain Dr. Bowring when he went out, but we" ISir John'd him. Sir Johna Bowring had been secretary to the Peace Society, and was a disciple of Bentham. It was thought, therefore, that we certainly sbould not have war under Sir John Bowring. Sir John Bowring is but a man, and I will say more, he is avain man, and he wished to play a great part in China. Now, by the treaty with China we have insured to ourselves five separate ports into which we could go and carry our merchandise. One of these ports was Canton, but the people of Canton are a peculiar people. They are very like the people of Sheffield; they have a wiU of their own ; they won't be coerced by their governor. They are somewhat a rough people, still bearing a resemblacee to the people of Sheffield. (Cheers.) They told the governor they did not like foreigners, and would not have them in their town. The governor told the foreigners, and among these the English, that they were unable to carry into enect the treaty which they had made. Various Secretaries of State, Lord Aberdeen, the Duke of Newcastle, Lord John Russell, Lord Palmerston, and somebody elseI forget the name, but there were five ("Lord Grey")all said we must bear with this difficulty. lt folowed upon the treaty that in the end Tongkong was gr'rento England. Wosentagovernorthere, and established a council caUed the Iogislsture of Hongkong. This Legislature determined they would give a sort of license to vessels to trade uPon the Canton river. But by the English laws- vessel so ienacd must have for its ow.ner a British subject. Mark that ! But
there was this requirement. The decision of the Hongkong Legislature required to be sanctioned by the Qu een and Privy Council. That sanction wvas not given for some time, and in thei meantime a vessel called the Arrowv received a license from the llonrtong Legislature before that ordinance was sanctionedby he Legislatureof England. The Arrowwent up the Canton river upon a certain day in October. She v,wa
boarded by the police of Oanton. They said that on board that loreha were certain men who were pirates. Mandarins came on board, and they did actually takre away 12 men out of the 14, those men being supposed to be pirates. That boarding was said to lhave been an insult to the flag of England, an insult to British subjects, and to the British kingdom. Thereupon a representation was made to the Governor of canton, a man who delights inthe name of Commisioller Yeh. Well, what does he say? He says, "I don't know that this vessel was an English vesseI ;" and, as it turned out, it was not an English Tvesel. She was not entitled to protection at the time when it was claimed. I hope the meeting wil bear with me when I tell them they aTe not perhaps as familiar with international law as I am. 1 a merchant veesel comes Into a foreign port she is considered a part of that port, and when lying at anchor she is considered as in conjunction with that land which she adjoins. But if a military vessel comes into a foreign port she is considered to be a part of that country from wnich she colnes. Thus, if an English manof-war were to go into a French port, she wonld be conaidtred aa part of England, and i as ch wolb-of-war goes into an English port she is considered as part of France. There is a great distinction between the two, but it appears that by a treaty with the people of China they gLve up this regular rale of international law, atd they said, " that althongh the case ws different between European nations, we will Say ULW-w, wl not bo t s: British veseel withouL t. a conseri of thbe British ecsa, and, in conjunction v6ds the zitish ciwsel, we ilLbeard her.,

And that was the fact. (Cheers.) What could be more complete? But for this thing we battered down the city of Canton. (Cries of "Shame !") Then at this moment there comes another important matter into cousidesation. Tha Chinese returned those men they had taken from on board that vesseL Yeh says, " We will not board, without sufficient reason, any <English vessel whatever. This was not ant English vessel but I did not intend to dispute ours right to hoist your flag upon a vessel when it is in English posses. sion. We didnot Insult your flag, and didn't intend so to do." Well, I say that wa all anybody ought to expeet. (Hear, hear.) But at that moment thero came a new element into the matter. We have been excluded from Can. ton, and every sucoessive Minister has permitted it. There is apaper here from Lord Palmerston, who says, "Forbear from entering by arms, it would do no good; I beg you to be quiet, and not Insist upon it.' (Hear, hear.) Stil Sir J. Bowring says this is a capital opportnnity for insisting on the demand to enter Conton. Yeh said, "I cannot admit you. You have yourselves acknowledged the difficulty." The answer of Admiral Sey mour and Sir J. Bowring was, "1If -ou do not admit us in 4S hours Canton shall be bombcrdede" Yeh said, "Iean. not admit you ;" and thoy did bombard the town. With these facts before the House of Commons, what was I to do.? Was I to say that it was justice to bombard a great and peaceful city, buming hundreds and thousands of house, rendering homeless nearly half a million of peole; killing men and women and innocent children? Why? Because it was said the English flag was insulted, and that Sir John Bowring was not admitted into Canton. I, as an. Englishman, as an honest member of Pasliament, as the representative of the merciful people of Sheffield, said that was no justification for the burning of a peaceful city. (Loud cheers.) No, gentlemen, I may lose the good opinmonof the gentlemen of Sheffield ("No I no l", but I lam quite sure I shall not lore the good opinion of the people of Sheffield. (Cheers.) When I think of the sight that must have presented itself to the eyes of Englishmen, -a peaceful city as large s London blazing and burninghells fired into it from the fleet of England-her great name prostituted to such direful cruelty,-I say that my heart would not bave beenmin its right place if, in your name,1 could havesanctioned such a thing. (Cheers.) And itis said for this I bave lostthe supportofthepeopleof Sheffield. ("Nover !" "Only a few " "Only six!") England is to me that which I cannot explain. I have been an exile, gentlemen. I have heard her name meutioned when I have been on a foreign shore, and the very name has thrilled through me. There is something conneczted with her glorious name that has lifted me up, and made me, small as I am, feel myself a big man. (Cheers.) I felt that in my person England was there. Anid to see her renown cast into the dust :degraded, bemired, made diahonourable by persons who never ought to have borne power in her name (cheers), made meashamed, andin your name I declared that the shame should not attach to her. (Cheers.) Did I do wrong, gentlemen? ("No, no.") The time will come when that vote will be looked upon as a great instance of the right feeling of the House of Commons of England. Looking oack through the history of my country, there are times in which I think good mcn must have felt theirhearts sink. Compaing small thingswithgreat,Icaufancythat the great Milton, when he saw the popular tido turn in favour of the Stuarts,-he who had rendered himself im. mortal by his writings in the cause of his country and of freedom-I can fancy that'he mtnthave feltbittershame to see the fabric of liberty he had aimed to rear destroyed. I have thought what must have been the feelngs of Burke when he lost his seat for opixsing the popular will as to the American war. The popular will overrode the wisdom of the senator, snd we lost America. When Fox opposed the rFrench war, how his heart must have sunk whenthe popular will overruled him in oppsmg What iWll call the frantic feeling of the country. He was overruled, and we have oCO,000,000. of debt in consequence, and you have the nephew of Napoleon on the throne of France. Well, Isay, compaxing small men with great, ours is a similar case. We have opposed the popular feeling of the people of Sheffield in this niatter, because we think they are wrong. I never -was so reitai in my life tbat I was QhS as In tli matter. I have no interest In leading you wrong. I have no place to hope for or to protect. I am not in the Mtinistry, and have no hope of forming part of any Administration. (Cheers. I have told you that I was a man who by natare oved ease-was indolent. I love peace. I am told by some of my friends that the best thing I can do upon the present occasion Is to retire, and seel- to improve my bealth. (Laughter.) Now, a very old fritad and philo. s,,,hetr Jeremy entham, a man who used strange freaks st thoEglish language, talked of " interest-begottenpre. judices." Now I think this an "intereetbegotten" kind. n ss. They advise me to retire. They say i am worn out inthe public service-that I have not lrainsto conduct your afiairs-and they wish to be put In my place. (Cheers and laughter.) I am no orator, as Brmtus is-Brutus being tIr.

I tell you at once I want to extend the suffrage, and I want to protect the voter by ballot. (Cheers) Whether a man be a Jew, whether a man be l Christian, whether he be a Catholic, or wlhether he be a Dissenter, in the eye of the law I would have all men stand equal. That is my beilef. I may be wrong. You are to say whother you thinl me wrong. If you do so do not raturn me. But if you think I am right you cannot return lMr. Overend. (Cheers.)

M1r. H,%miFELD was asho received withi much cheering, and briefly addressed the meeting.
After a slight reference to the opium trade with China, -which both Mr. Hadfield and Mr. noebc condemned in the strongest terms amidd loud cheers from the mneeting, i
Mr. W. FIssEsE proposed a resolution:-
"That in the opinion of this meeting John Arthur Roebuck and George Hafiteld, Esqe., bave faithfuls and independently acted up to the principles wbich they avowed wben they sought the suifrags of the electors of Sheffeld; therefore this meeting considers them the moset St and Droper persoDs to represent this borough In Parliament."
Dr. HOLLANiD seconded, and hMr. H.Rvzy supported, the resolution, which was put and carried uninimously amid loud cheers.
The proceedings then terminated, after the candidates had briefly expreesed their thanks to the meeting.
HUDDERSFIELD.
Our readers will recollect the alarming accident which occurred on Thursday night while Mr. Cobaen was address. ing a crowded meeting of the electors in the theatre, and by which several persons were more or less injured In consequence of the accident the proceedings of the meetin; were broughtto am etabrupttrmination. To remedy thisand to afford the electors an opportunity of hearing a full exposition of Mr. Cobden's poltical views, a meeting of the electors was convened by circular to take place in the Gymnasium-hall on Saturday evening lat. There was a most crowded attendance of electors at thkeap pointed tune, Mr. W. Willans, J.P., echairman of Mr. *Cobden' committee, was voted to the chair.
Mr. CoBDEN, on presenting himself, was received withl immense cheering. Aftor apologizing for the weakness of his voice, which was caused by hs addressing 5,000 or 6,000 persons in the Free-trade Hal, Manchester, on behalf of hhi friend John Bright, and, recapitulating his arguments on the Chinese question, he went on to speak of the ballot and suffrage, to which he Wad before alluded. He said, connected with these there was an organic change necessary of as great importance as either, and that was the redistribution of electoral power in the country. It was possible to extend the franchise to any extent, and yet con. trivo to hand over the power to a feo families, as in the palmy days of the rotten borough system, by giving two seats to Ripon and one to Huddersfield, lSalford, or Dundee. The franchise ought to be distributed according to the population and wealth of a district, and in England it wool be found that wealth increased ia proportion to the population, forming the rule for an equal allotment of electoral power. Ireland would be an exception to this rule, but Ireland was an exception and anomaly in almost everything; and there they found that popultion had little reference to wealth. He was in favour Of shortening the duration of Parliaments fro seven to three years, bis reasons being that few were aware of the extent tovwhich a House of Commors might be coerced by the treat of a dicsolaUton. (Hear, hear.) Lord Palmerston during a considerable portion of last session, and the whole of this session, had exercised a considerable factious away ever the House of Commons by the cosiuns of having the powTer of dissolution in his
?ae,Why wr emes7ado goingto meet theirec
rtitUents ? One main consideration was the enormous ex penses inp witch they were mnuloted for shle elections, es. percia in Scotland, where, with the purest constituencie
the members were subjected to heavier legal and other charges tha.u in, England. If we had three years' instead of seven years' Parliaments, they would come to be considered as of bond fide duration; for it must be a crids indeed that would render necessary a disaolution before the time, and there would not be the same capricious exercise of the power of dissolutioni. This reform, coupled with that of the ballot, would save a vast amnount of turmoil and strife, as the effect of the ballot would be to put an end to the practice of canvassingat elections, and themore, frequent recurrence of elections would be considered by men of all parties as, a great boon. Hre observea that his hon. opponent had a plan for permissive balot, but he (Mr. Cob. den) was for compulsory ballot. He would make everybody vote by ballot, with permisive open voting-tlht was, any man who chose to put the name of his favourite candidate, Cobden or Akroyd on his hat or on his back was at libert
to do so. (Cheers.) A new Reform BiU was necesary; it was 25 years since there had been any such meare, and at present the government of the country was entirelyin the hands of an oligarchy of fropi 700,000 to 800,000-only that number being witbin the electoral pale. He was sorry tat Lord John Russell-and certainly the pluck of that little nobleman was always calculted to draw forth the admiration of his countrymen, and eseily Yorkslsirmen, who were food of fibting-still gi a e bot, as he felt certain that his view of reorganizing the Liberal party, with a view to aseactionat no distant date, was based upon reform.

Mr. Cobden arguled that should we take possession of any portion of the territory of China, it might give umbrage to the United States and embroil us with that country. Mr. Cobden then said he had been charged with being anxious to reduce our military establishments, so that wo should be ently defenceless. What he had said a thousand times in every direction 'was, that we Bshould spend 10,000,0001. on mnilitary and naval defences, but if any hostile attack threatened the shores of England he 'would as cheerf'ully vote 10O,000,0001 as 10,00%O00oZ.

It was not unusual to see among the items of receipt 500,000., 400,0001., or 600,0001. for old stores, and these stores he would venture to say had cost 3,000,0001. Of this wasteful expenditure he gave numerous instances. We ought to be sure that the money we voted 'was well expended, and this could never be done so long as the army, navy, and ordnance were under the management of the class of people who had so long had the exclusiven anagementofthosedepartments. (Loudapplause.'
Mr. COBDEN then, in answer to questions put, stated that he should, after their recent vote in favour of the Canton massacre, vote that the bishops be excluded from the House of Lords. He shonld not vote for the opening of the Crystl alace or Crystal Palace grounds on the Sunday, nor would he vote for the Maine Law.
Mr. SHAWv, constable of Huddersfield, proposed, and Mr. THom,AS MALLniSsoN seconded, Mr. Cobden as a fit and proper person to represent the borough, and the resolution was carried by an overwhelming majority. The result 'was received with rounds of applause.
The meeting terminated about 10 o'clock.
ESSEX (NORTH).
At present no Liberal candidate is in the field in opposition to the Right Hon. W. Beresford and Mr. Charles Dacane, but rumours have been circulated that Mr. Hony wood, of Marks-hall, will be put in nomination. On Saturday a very influential meeting of the electors of the northern division 'was held at the Caps Hotel, Colchester to hear an explanation from Major Beresford of the course he had pursued in reference to the Chinese question, and also an enunciation of the political sentiments of the new candidate. The chair was taken by Mr. C. G. Round.
Major BERESFOP.D, after some prefatory remarks, referred to the China question. When this China question was brought beore the House of Commons by
Cobdeu he considered the matter calmly and delberately, and as it presented itself to him he confessed that he did not like it. (Hear, hear.) Neither did
e Like the quarter whence it came. (Hear, hear.) He had in his Parliamentary career aced pretty faithfully with one party; he always had felt, and always should feel, a strong peroonal attachment to the leader of that partyLord Derby; and it was very diffiacult, under such cdrcumstances, for a man to think very differently from those with whom he had been accustomed to act. (Hear, hear.) But the path of duty lay before him- he thought Mr. Cobden's motionwns not a straightforwar, genuine, English act, and therefore he determined that he 'would not vote for it. (Lod eers.) Before thc civision night arrived he hu9s m sny opportunities of conversing upon the question with gentlemen who occupied a high position in the Conservative party, and he said enough for them to understand that he did not agree with them. The argaments which they used to alter his opinion did not succeed, and he than received a very pressing written application upon the subject. He would not state anything that should in the slightest degree be a breach of confidence, bat he wished to defend his conduct and to put the matter fairly before them. He answered that application immnediately and without couferring with a smgle individnal; and although at the time he 'wrote that letter he had not the slightest idea of its ever coming befo-e the public-although it was not written with any desire to curry favour with any party, yet, s that letter did express his opinions upon the question and upon the state of circumstances 'which then eisted, he would venture T,O trouble them with 'what he would call the poliical pat of it, and by the views therein expressed he was ready to stand or falL It said:
In the Aint place, I do rot like the company which you baTe lately been keeping or endeaaroring to keep. I w-il not enter Into the controversy ot wheiher it isa coalition or an agreement, or an approxima tion. Idonotllkesuchoo,npany. Itmtutbring discredit, and wi

Further I must look at the oonequeneea of such a vote in its resuts here at borue. A change of Government Is unzvoid3ble; na7, you acknowledge thatauchis thd object 3n view. ereo Imust confe6s that I am opposed to turning out an existing Adsinitratton unless I seeolainly a fair chaice, at leas,of establishing in Its placesa better one, which base reasonable prospect of holding itb ground. Now Lord Derby has proclimed to the country that be cannot form such a Government with Wr. Gladsone and Mr. Sidney Herbert. If he ha3 had no communicatioa (as I am told) with them, how can he make sure that they wi
not sgain dedlne? ani If they do oinwM not sach a coalition bring more discredit than strength with it? Another and a very strong obJection which I entertain to the chanre at this moment is the COnviction in my mind that the frst act of this coalition, a3 a doTerment, wil be to out down the ilitury eatimus, und to reduoe the army &gain to that state of L. eSidiency from which it has only just amerged-an inefcieney for which both Mr. Gladstono and Mir. S3idney Herbert were In some degree arcesorv and anwetablo for."
Such were the reasons which brought him to the conclusion not to vote for 3Ir. Cobaden's motion; but with regard to voting against it, having uniformly uaPn general subjects voted with his party, and with the fee 'gw which he entertained towards the leaders of that party, he thought it would be kinder on his part to retire into the country, and not to be present at that division. (Hear, hear.) The hon. gentleman then entered into an explanation of his views on the particular points in dispute on the China question. The Chinese intended to insult the English flag; they did insult it i and he would rather see a " turbulent and awgesuve po'icy" that'would resent such an insult, than any milkand-water nonsense that would trample that flag inthe dust. That flag had long 'waved over the 'rorld, and neither Chinese nor any one else should insult it with impunity; and he would say that the Minister who stood up for the honour of England deserved the applause and the support of the English people. ("Hear, hear" and cheers.) In sEying this, however, ho did not take upon himself tojuastifalJl the acts of Sir John Bowring- there were several points in his conduct'which require explanation, but in the absence of full information upon the subject he stil though' he ought to be supported as long as he was chief representative at that station. (Hear, hear.) He concluded by calling Upon the electors to rallv round his colleague and himself, and again vindicate the Conservative character of the Northern Division of Essex.
The meeting responded with " Three cheers for Major Beresford.e
Mr. C. DucA.arz next addressed the meeting at considerable length. In reference to the Chinese question, he said it was attempted by the Ministry to create in the country a feeling in favour of Lord Palmerston andto make it theogreat subject of discussion at the forthcoming election; but when the unnatural excitement which it had created had passed away, the great subjocts of domestic economy which had always formed the division between tho Conservatives and Tories would remain for adjustment, and therefore it was unjust to make the Chinese question the watchword at the forthcoming election. After all the consideration he had been able to give the question he had come to the concluson that Sir John Bowring was not justified. He regretted that the Government a month ago had not intimated theirintention of sending qata nobleman to negotiate and investigate the whole matter, for then the voice of the country and the House of Commons also 'would have been stifled. He was, however, in favour of the war being vigorousl,y carried on, and would sapport Lord Palmerston in bringing this anpleasant affair to an honoUrable and satisfactory termination, 'whether by negotiation or by open and active hostilties. (Cheers.) In reference to matters of more domestic interest, he expressed himself in favour of a re4uction of those taxes which pressed heavily on the poor man. (Cbeerm) He 'was opposed to the grant to taynooth. Church-rates he considered it their duty to continue, being an impost t which landed property had been subject from a remote period, and under 'which all sales had been effecoted. He then called upon the electors to rally round the Conservative cause in North Essex, andcsecure the return of the Rlight Hon. William Beresford and himx-
ResoIulions1were then adopted, expressive of the appoa by the constituents of the candidates, and ple gtho meeting to do all in its power to insure their return.

He was opposed t compulsory churchrates. But, although in favouar of civil and roligocs liberty he should vote against the admission of Jews into Parlian
fent, because, finrt, the Englis t Government was a Christian one, whichx a Jow -if consisfent would seek to
ubvert; and 'next, because an accesnion of texinoneyed interest in rarliament would exercise a most injnrious influence on the country. (Murmurs of disapprobation) In regard to6 the Mynooth grant, he should not vote lfor its being dicontinuedwhileotber sects receivedfor religions and educational purposes Government aid. He would vote for law reformi, army reformn, and financial reform. He was opposed to e incomio-tax, but was mtorein favour of a property and income-tax than of a tax upon the articles of niversal co-Fnsuption. Vote by ballot would have hisWmost decided supiport.
The sentimnents ontertairied upon political meamurs by the Hon. Messrs. Calthorpeand Wrottesley were then communicated to themeeting. Afterwhieh,
Mr. eoLrm was introduced, and said that lhe ash repared to support an extension of the suffrage, and woul vote for Mr. Locke King's motion. Was decidedly in favour of vote byballot.4esgsrded chuarch-rates as aninjusticetoDissenters, and injurious to churchmen. Would votefor theaadmission of Jews into Prliamnent. (Hear, hear.) He should he decidedly one of Lord Palmerston's supporters. Was prepared to lighten the tax in precarious incomaes, and would vote arainst the re-inmpsition of the ineome-tax in 1860. Shoul be infavour o the abolition'of pawsing tolls, Would uppott the reduction of the national expenditrei if that should be consistent with the maintenance of the efficiency of tho country.
Mr. Mathews having acceptedl the invitation of the previous meeting, he was considered as a candidate to whom the presnt meeting , orld give their support. A division then took place on bhalf of the other three candidates, when there were--For Mr. Foley, 25 ;theHon. Athur Wrottesley, 19; the Ron. F.

The chairman was authorized to publish throughout South Staffordshire thu decision to which the meeting had come, and to recommens Messrs. 'Mathews uad Foley to the general cofnstituency for election.
The mneetin g then separated.
The members of the iron trade are convened by their chairman to attend a meeting upon the reproenmtation of this division of the county, but it is not expected that their decon wil change the present aspect of affAirs.

Although Mr. Dillon first introduced hnimself to the London public as an actorof "drame," he has ever been sMIn bitious to display his talents inL impersonations of the socalled '"legitimate' kind. His first Shakspearian experiment was OtheUo, which proved most fortunate; his second, made vust now, amid every demonstration of public satisfaction, Is Hamlet
From what hasbeen seen of Mr. Dilon's previous eharacters,. it was not difficul- to foresee which side of Hamlet's eharacter he would make prominent,-to foresee that the emotional rather than the intellectual element in the Danish prince would be uppermost in his thoughts. To take up a speech u a thing external, and to displaingentity T carryng it through infinite varieties ot emphasis and expression, would obviously be foreign to his theory of histrionic art. You do not listen to him to studhis " readings," but to discover how soon his emotions will be identified with those of the character,-and we may truly*ay that the greater the warmth required the more hew "w arms un. Thnus, in Hamet, although the first two acts are careful y a*nd conscientiously performed, it is not tiU the third that Mr. DiUon's peculiarity Is revealed. The tenderness with which he survoys Ophelia in the midst of his ravings about the "nunnery," and to which he gives extreme expression by dropping on his knee and fondly kissing her hand, is natural from its spontaneous appearance, and his welcome to Horatio, on the entrance of the latter, has a frankness about it that is singularly tonching. Nothing of great moment occura at this mneeting of t e two friends, but the notion is conveyed that a kindly heart, long placed amid uncongenial spirits, has at lengt found a sympathetic being on which it can reposeThe watching of the Eing during the play scene is carried out through alU its details with immense earnestness, and the burst of triumph in which it results is most powerfuL Ia the " closet sone" anew arrangement is made, whichleads
to a noew histrionic effect, The ghost does not cross the front of the stage, but the lower part of the side and back scene becomes transparent, and the spectre is seen passing from behind the picture of the deceasedlKing to the point where it vanishes. Its steps are followed by Hamlet, who thus leads his mother round the apartment in a state of rapt attention, and the explosion with which he utters the words " Out at the portal," and sinks ia n chair, exhausted with the mental strain, is terrific. Throughout the whole of this act the actor has more and more entered into the spirit of the scene, and here is his climax. He has gained his audienoe, and now he may fearlessly pursne his victory through the two remaining acts, even though Iaertes does not allow him to display his fencing to the best advantage. - . ___

ROYAL SUBRBEY GARDENS.
The concert given, under th. di-rect-ion of Ki. Jullien, ont behalf of the ftunds of the Early Cloeing Association, n the new Music-hball of the Surroy-gardens, notwithstanding the unfavourable weather on Friday evening, attracted an im. mense crowd. If we ar rightly informed, there were nearly 7,000 persons present. The performaance was on a scala commensurate with the reputation M. Jullien has long enjoyed as an organizer of such vast musical undertakings There was his own band, with himself to conduct the orchestral works, and Mr. Alfred Mellon to preside at the instrument3l solos and vocal pieces. lisaea Dolby and Louisa Vinning were the singers; Mr. Lazarus (clarinet), and Miss ArabeflA Goddard p ianoforte), the instrumental performers, Mr. Land's chorus, too, was pressed into the service, so t'eat completeness and efficiency were insured in aU departments.
The programme (we were glad to find) embraced afairproportion of each of the two comprehensive schools into which music may be said to be divided. The " classical" was represented (andlargely represented) by Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber, and Mozart. We mention Mozart last, instead of first, simply because the single piece in the selection to which his name was attached was the second air of Chermbino, the pago in Figaro-" Voi che sapete." This lovely melody was for the most part chastely sung by Miss Louisa Vinning, who was not only encored, but would have entirely satisfied connoisseurs had it not been for a change near the end, where she took a note, of great consequence to the symmetry of the whole, a third higher, and thus spoiled both the beauty of the phrase and the effect of her own performance. Miss Dolby, who was also encored in Mendelssohn's " First violet," ventured on no such liberties, but gave thet graceful and expressive song n all its purity. In Mr. Balfe's t ery elegant setting of Lonefellowhs poem, "eThe green trees whispered lowf ,
pirs Dolbnu as equally snccetfuL Thi, too, was redemianded. The other vocal mo>rccaau ( w ere of far less miudical interest.
M. Julaiend a part in the programme, as chcf dco'hcf_urre was of the highest imp ortance. Besides the romantio and cbivalrous overture to WVeber's too much negylected opera of ec myanThc (which Beetoven bimselfd so ucary of praise, pronornced "good"), together vith frsDments from thes pastoral symphony and symphony in A (hslo. 7) of the great oermanmsterigoh admirably played-the Itaohan sgmphoiy (inrA) of endelssohn was given entire, and with surprisi spirit and preision. Late in the evecinp as this tch wh
was introducedsit was hoar d with M ndeviatine attention, and each movement loudly applauded by an a udiene not quite. soremarkable, by the eway for musical discemrment as many of those which th Juilien has long been in tbe habit of attractinggt his winter concerts. Another gatifyn circumstance w,as the enthusasm excid by the u iisa pianoforte concert of the same composer, thea whole of which was performed by Yiss Arabella Goddard, who,
t the credit of so young an artist, never comes forrd before a musical audience with mutilated versions of great wvorks. She played the coneerto of MKendelssohn in her very best manner, snd wras rewvarded by the ounaaimooa apprcciation of her hearers. Her brilliant execution of oneo o' the fantnsias of Thslberg(tbeMIoise) wrhichW of recent yeres,
has been partially abandoned for inferior productions of' the same class, created another and s differenb kind of sensation. The pianoforte compositions of Thalberg are s.x
cellent of their kind, and, having dont real, ser-ioe so the, imechanical development of the pianoforte, should not be. allowed to sink altogether into oblivien,
Between the parts there was uomeos4ted and enlivenia
dance music, conducted by M. J3 en, consisng of hiii "Excelsior Valse," "Mary Auhb JolTa," and a niew and capital set of quadriles entitled 'The Eglish J]ancers,

Sir JoiN PATrESOx, Sir W. H. MAIUL, thc rc7,.
bisep of CAxzIu[ny, and the BiAi, of L,oxDos.'
At 3 o'clock the committee was constituted al abovs for the purpose of delivering judgment in the Knightsbridge cases. The council-ohamber was densely crowded, and several ladies were accommodated with seats within tho bar.
Mr, PUBERTOlN LIGH delivered the judgment, which was to the following effect :-These cases como before ths Coturt by appeal from two orders in distinot suits, directing the removal of various articles of church furniture, in the one case from the district church or chapel of St. Panl, Knightsbridge, and in the other from the chbpel of ease of St. Barnabas, Pimlico. Although there is some distinction between the eircumstances of the two cases, they involve the same principles, they were included in one argument at this bar, and will be conveniently disposed of In one judgment. It app ears that tho district church of St. Paul was erected by private subscription; that tho income by which it is supported is derived from the rent of pews; that 3r. Lidde31 is the incumbent, and Mr. Home and Mr Westerton the two churchwardens. The two churchwarden, differed as to the propriety of certain ornaments of the church, and in Hilary Term, 1855, the suit out of which the present appeal arises was instituted in the Conaistory Court of London, by Mr. Westerton, against Mr. Home and Mr. Liddell, who are now the appellants. The citation called upon the appellants to show cause why a faculty should not be granted for removing the altar, or high altar, and the cloths used for covering the same, toge. ther with the wooden cross elevated thereon and affixed thereto, as well as the candlesticks thereon, together with the credentia, preparatory altar or credence table, used in the said church or chapel, and for substituting in lieu and stead thereof a decent and proper table for the administration of the Lord's Supper and Holy Comnmunion, and a decent cloth for the covoring thereof. The answer of the defendants alleges that the article of church furniture called In thecitationanaltar, orhigh altar, is in fact,and accordingto the true and legal interpretation of tho 82d of the constitutions and canons of England and Ireland as by law eatablshed, mensa co7n2g et dscens, or a convenient and decent table, such s is required by law for the celebration of the Holy Communion, and denies that the wooden cross is inconsistent with the laws, canons, customs, and constitutions of the said church. In subsequent passages of the answer this table is always spoken of as the altar or com. munion table, and it is alleged that the said altar or com. munion table, and the platform on which the same is raised, the wooden cross attached thereto, the gilded candlesticks, and the said idde-table or credence-table, were placed In the same church as the same now exist and formed part of tho furniture thereof at the time of the consecration of the dad church and of the furniture thereof by the Lord Bishop of London on the 30th of May, 1843. (App. 9.) Their Lordships understand that this table, described as an altar, or communion table, is made of wood, and is not attached to the platform, but merely stands upon it; that it is placed at the east end of the church, or the chancel, according to the ordinary usage as to communion table; that at the end nearest the wall there is a narrow ledge raised above the rest of the table; that upon this ledge, which is termed the "super-altare," stand the two gilded candlesticks, which are moveable, and between them the wooden cross, which is let into and fixed in the super-altare, so as to form part of what is thus described as the altar or communion table. The judgment complained of has not ordered the removal of the table or of the Candlesticks, but only of the cros, the credence-table, and the cloths. There is no appeal agalnst this order, as far aS it permits the table and candlesticks to remain, and it is therefore not open to their Lordshi ps to consider the Judgment with reference to the articles not ordered to be removed. The evidence as to the wishes of the parishiones upon this subject appears to their Lordships to show what, in such a case, might perhaps be expected, that with respect to these ornaments there are many persons Of great respectability who from conscientious motives are strongly attached tothem; many of equalrespectability who, from motives equaly conscientious, feel an invincible repugnance to them; and some, it may be hoped not a few, who, whatever opinion they may form of their intrinsic ralue, consider them as of no importance whatever in com. pari80n with Christian charity and concord, and who, whether they approve or whether they disapprove them, would infinitely rather sacrifice their individuaT feelings and opinions than secure their triumph at the expense of disturbiDg and distracting the church of 'which they are members. With respect to the case of " Liddell v. Beal," St. Ba bas is a chapel of ease within the district chapelry of St. Paul, of which the curates are appointed by Mlr. LiddedL In this case both the chapelwadens agree with Mr. Liddell as to the ornaments in question. On the 17th of January, 1855, a monition was issued against them, at the instance of Mr. Beal, an inhabitant of the district chapelry of St. Barnabas, by which they were monished to remove from the said chapel the rood-screen and brazen gates, together with the cross elevated and fixed on the said screen, and also the stone altar and cloths now usedforcoveringthe same, and the cross ornamented with ewels elevated therGon and fixed thereto with the caudlestcks and candles placed thereon, and also the marble credentia, preparatory altar orcredence-table, andto'substitute in lieu and stead thereof a decent table for the administration of the Lord's Supper and Holy Communion, and a decent coverng thereto, and to set up on the east end of the chancei of the said chapel the Ten Commandments as bv the laws, canons, institutions, and customs of the tnite-d Church of England and Ireland is prescribed. (Ap a.,cse 7.) The answor admits that between the chancel and the nave of the church there is a screen of carved wood, on the summit vwhereof a wooden cross is affixed. It admits, in substance, the existence of the stone table, or altar, with the metal cross attached thereto, and it insists that the article of furniture so described is a mensa conWgrua et decens within the meaning of the canons, and such a communion table as is requied by law for the celebration of the Holy Communion. It admits the use of various cloths differing in colour from each other as coverings of the communion table at different seasons, and that the covering used on the said altar or communion table at the time of tne administration of the Holy Communion is of worked and embroidered white linen, ornamented and enriched with and bordered at the ,ends with elaborately worked lace, and that the other articles bf linen used in the said office are also decorated and enriched withwhite lace. It denies that the credence-table is attached to the chancel, and alleges that the same is a moveable table, necessary and convenlent for the decent celebration of the Holy Communion according to the rubrics of the Book of Common Prayer. The answer then alleges that these ornaments existed in the church when it was consecrated in 1850, and that the services are attended by large and devout congregations, whose religions feelings would be violated by their removal. The judgment com-
lained of has ordered the church or chapel wardens of St.
abas to remove the present structure of stone unsed as a communion table in the said church, and to provide instead thereof a moveable table of wood; to remove the credence-table; to remove the cross on the screen, as also the cross on or near the present structure used as a coinminion table; to take away all the cloths at present used in the said church or chapel for covering the structure now used as a communion table during the time of divine service, and to provide and substitute in place of the said cloths one only covering for the communion table of silk or other decent stuff; and, further, to remove any cover used a.t3thc timo of the mnisitration of the sacrament, worked or embroidered with lace or otherwise ornamented, and to substitute a fair white linen cloth, without lace or embroidery or other ornament; to cover the communion table at the time of the ministration of the sacrament, and to cause the Ten Commandments to be set up on the east end of the church in compliance with the terms of the canon. As to the order directing the Ten Command. ments to be set up there is no appeal. When this case came by appeal before the Dean of the Arches aome additional evidence was given with resoect to the kssent of the Bishop of London to the use of these ornaments before the chpel 'was consecrated. But it does not appear to their Lordships to be necessary to go into this part of the case. Their Lordships will deal with each of the articles which are the subject of appeal separately; and, lst, with respect to the crosses, the point to which by far the greater part of the argument at this bar was addressed. No distinction was taken by the Courts below between the different crosses which are the subject of ppeal-between the crosses on what are termed the aitar or communion tables, both at St. Paul's and St. Barnabas, and the cross on the chancel screen in St. Barnabas. The learned judges have treated them as bein allsubject to the same considerations, and have orderea them all to be removed as illegal ornaments. But though both judges arrived at the same conclusion, there is some diference between the reasons asined for their decisions. Dr. Luahington seems to have held that the question was what ornaments could be shown to have been in churches in the second year ef the reign of E3dwvard VI,, by authority ofPriaet according to the rubric of the present Prayer-
book, accordnng to the true construction of those words? Sir J. Dodson, on the other hand considered the question to depend on the effect of certZan Royal injunctions and &A Act of Parllament agalnst the use of Imes, Among whicl he considered crosses tobe included. It 'will be neces sary. tq examine both these grounds of deciAon with the attentiop. and respect which are due to the eminent persons who have-adopte4 them- and first, as to the effect of the rubir. In dealing with this question it is necessary to remensier th.at there were many crosses, rome with, some whethr, the image of the Savour, whichwere in use in the llonas Catholic rntual; altar rees, precessional creae funeral crosses, and others, as well as painted or carved representatons of the ross not u8edin the services, but set up as architeQurai decorations of churches, and the question is whether the rubric applies to the latter elass. The rubric is ism thee-words :-.
" And here it is to be noted that such ornaments of the chuu.ch and( of the ministers thereof at all times of their minirtry sAbll be retained and be inuse aswere in this Church of En1glad, by autbotity of Parliament in the seosid year of Sig.rward Vt"
Dr. Lashington was-of opinion that by the true construcion d .these words referenou Int8t be had to the Act ef the 2daosl3d of Bdwarl VL. an the Pnyer-bok which it eqtahIi4I1rtbspumo.e oftdterminigwrat knaniente 'were t pisned, butihe was pscleed by the dHEii cuty ii S J4bee 'were 'words in that Prayer-bock 4es:htj byp lpt do the nsiniAu thqr wecg e

All the aeveril ioles used in the performance of the services and rites of tlhe church are ornaments. Vestments, books, cloths, chalices, and patens are among church ornaments; a long list of them will be found extracted from Lynde. woode, in Dr. Phillimore'a edition of "' Burrl's .cdesiastical Law." In modern times organs and bells are held to fall under this denomination. When reference is had to the first Prayer Book of Edward VIL, with this ex lanation of the term "1ornament," no diffioulty will be found in discovering among the artioles of which tho use Is there enjoined ornaments of the church as well as ornaments of the ministers. Besides the vestments differing in the different services, the rubrio provides for the use of an English Bible, the new Prayer Book, a poor man's box, a chaie, a corporas, a paten a be, and some other things. That these articles wereincluded in the term "ornaments of the church" atthe period in question is clear from two documents-nearl contemnporaneous, one before and the other after the esa1blishment of the first Prayer Book. In a letter of the Council to Cranmer, dated the 30th of April, 1548 (to be found in Strype's Mmlr a
of Oranmcr, vol. ii., p. 90), they complain of the conduct of certain churchwardens, who sent away their chalices, crosses of silver, bells, and other ornaments of the church- and in a commission in 1552 (Cardw. Doc. Ann., 112) the com missioners are enjoined to leave in every church or chapel of common resort one, two, or more bhalices or cups, according to the multitude of people in every auch church or chabel, and also such other ornaments as bv their discretion shab seem reuidte for the Divine service in every such place for tho tnme. If reference be now made to tho alteras tions in these snattersintroduced bythesewond PrayerBook of Edward VI., and the subsequent rubric to the Prayer Book of Elizabeth, the meaning wiUl be sufficiently clear. The second Prayer Book forbids the use of different vest. ments by the priest in tho prformance of the different services, and enjoins the use of a surplice only, and does not expressly mention the paten, chaloe, and corras After the overthrow of Protestantism by Queen ar, and its restoration on the accession of Queen Elizabeth a great controversy rose between the mnore violent and the more moderate Eeformers as to the church servico which should be re-established, whether it should be accord' to the first or according to the second Prayer Book ofdward VlI The Queen wasin favour of the first, but she was obliged to give way, and a compromise was made, by which the services were to be in conformitywith the second Prayer Book, with certain alterations, but the ornaments of the churb, whether thos4 worn or those otherwise used by the minister were to be according to the first Prayer Book. In confor. mity with this arrangement the Act 1 Elizabeth chap. 2,
ias passed, by which the use of the second Prayer Book was establshed, but it was provided "that such ornaments of the church and of the ministers thereof sball be retained and be in use as was in this church of England by authority of Parliament in the 2d year of the reign of King Edward VI., until other order taken therein by the authority of the Queen's Majesty, with such ad1vicea hri
mentioned." The rubrio to the new PrayerBookame to express the meanng of this proviso, is these wordsi-
IAd here is to be noted that the minister, at the tim of the Communion, and at all other times of ministration shall use such ornaments in the church as ainseby authority of Parliament in the second year of the rein of King Edward VL, according to the Act of Primn e in the beginning of this boot "
Here the term "ornaments' is used as covering both the vestments of the ministers and the several articles used In the services; it is confined to such things as in the performance of the services the mnister was to use, It wil be obh served that this rubric does not adopt precisely the lan. guage of the statute, but expresses the sume thing in other words. The statute says such ornaments of the church and of the minister "shall be retained and be in use;" the Rubric, "that the ministershall use suchornaments in the church.2 The rubric to the Prayer Book of January 1,
604, adopts the language of the rubric of Elizabeth, The Rubric to the present Prayer Book adopts the language of
the statute of Eizabeth; but they all obviously mean the same thing,-that the same dresses and the same utensis or articles waich were used under the first Prayer Book of Edward VI. may still be used. None of them, therefore, ean have any reference to articles not used in the services, but eet up in churches as ornaments in the sense of decorations. It was urged at the bar that the present rubric, which refers to the second year of Edward VI., cannot mean ornaments mentioned in the firstPrayer Book, because, as it is said, that Act was probably not passed, and the Prayer Book was certainly not in use, till after the
piration of the second year of Edward It, and that therefore the words " by authority of Parliamnent" must mean by virtue o£ canons or Royat injunctions having the authority of Parliament made at an earlier period. There seems no reason to doubt that theAct in questhonreceivedthe Royal assent in the second year of Edward VI. It concerned a matter of greaturgency which had been long under consideration, and was thee first Act of the session; it passed through one House of Parliament on January 15, 1549, N.S., and the other on the 21st of the same month; and the second year of the reign of Edward VL did not expire till January 28th. A missive of the Counc theBishops, dated Mlarch 13, 1549, N. S., spealm of it ag an Acb passed at the Parliament lately holden at Westminster ; and in the Act of the 5th and 6th Edward VI. chap. 1, seo. 5 it is ex. pressly referred to as the Act " made in the second year of the King's Majesty's reign. Upon this point, therefore, no difficulty can arise. It is very true that the new Prayer Book could not come into use unti after the expiration of that year, because time must be allowed for printing and distributing the books; but its use, and the injunctions contained in it, were established byauthority of Parliament in the second year of Edward V Imand this is the plain meaning of the rubric. It was contended by Mr. Sbphens, in a very able argument, that the canons passed in the reign of Henry Vm. had no Parliamentary authority in the reign of Edward VI., for that the true meaning of the statates relating to that subject paEsed in the reign of Henry VIII., is, that thee provide for the review of the existing canons by commissoners appointed by the King and give authority to those canons only In the meantc * e., during the continuance of the commision; that the commisdoners never made any report- ihat the commissions determined by the death or King Henry VM. - and that the Parliamentary sanction given to the canons ended at the same time. iit were necessary to determine this point, their Lordships think this argument might deserve serious consideration, although it is contrary to the general impression which has prevailed upon the subjeot. As, however, their Lordships entertain no doubt whatever as to the mean. ing of the words "a uthority of Parliament"' used in the rubric, it is useless to enter further into the question, Their Lordships, therefore, are of opinion that,;although the rubric exduded all use of crosses in the services, the general auestion of cros3es not used in the serices, but employed only as decorations of churches, is entirely unaffected by themrubric. If crosses of the latter descnption were in use in thosecondyear 'of Edward VI. they derive no protection from the rubric - if they were lawfully in use thev are not excluded by the rubric, though they might not have the sanction of the authority of Parliament. The next question is, are crosses forbidden under the term
imagesa in tho injunctions and Act of Parliament relied on by Sir John Dodson? It is laid down in the judgment, and was stroigly pressed at the bar, that the term "images" may apply to crosses; that "imaginescrucis" are oftenmentioned,aswvellas "imaginescrucifxi,etsanctoram," that the cross, at the accession of Henry VIII., was itself an object of superstitious worship In the Roman Catholic Church; that two services in its honour are found in the Roman Catholic missal- that it was abused like other imsges, and was abolished like other Images. It is iuapos. sible to deny that crosses are frequently spoken of among images, The Artioles concerning laudsale ceremonies, publised by Henry VIIm in 1536, under the head "Of Images," declare "that the worship is to be doneonly to God, although it be done before the images, whether it be of Christ, of the cross, of our Lady, or any other saint beside." (1 Cardw., Formularies, xxvii*) And passages to the same effect are to be found ia other contemporary documents. But the result of the best examination which their Lordships have been able to mako is that the term "image," though it may be extended by the context, is generally to benunderstood in a more limited sense. Although it is true that crossea have been abused as well as cruclfixes and imagm of saints, it must be remembered that thereis a wide ifference between the cross and the images of saints, and even, though in a less degree, between a cross and a crucifix A cross was used as a symbol of Christanity for two or three centuries before either crucfixes or images were introduced; it was used for ages before the Reformation, and has continued ever since to be used as an erisi^^ofonour, as an ornament both of buildings and persons, ecclesiastical and civil, public and private, without any relation to superstitious or even to religious aes, That this wa the view taken by some of the early refomer will sufiiently appear by a letter of Cassauder, to be prently mentioned. The distinction between the cross andimages is still more
formedinto the crucifix, oritself became the objectof adora. tion, it was the memorial of a real event, the most momentous that ever happened in the history of the world, and was worshipped, however erroneously, only in connexion with that Berog to whom all worship is due. The images of the saints, on the other hand, were often connected (to use the language of some of the writings to which we must referl with lying legends and feigned miracles; and it might well be that the worship and invocation of saints should be abolished, and the images connected with that practicebo swept away, while the cross was retained with the faith of which it was an emblem. The important cuestion, however, Is not what it was reasonable to do, but what in fact was done by the regulations forthe removal of images. The first set of injunctions of Edward VI. were issued in the first year of his reign, some time, as it was said, between the months of May and August, 1547. (Cardw., Doo, Ann, 5.) By these injunctions the clergy re required to teach the people that all the usurped authority of the Bishop of Rome has been justly abolshed. They are not to extol any images, relies, or miracles for any superstition or lucre, nor allure the people by any enticements to the pilgrimage of any saint or image; they are toteach that works devised by mes's fantases, beddes scripture, as wandering in pilgrimages, offering of money, candles, or tapers to relies or Images, or kissing or eling the same, praying upon boads or such like superstition, have not only no promise of reward in scripture for doing of them, but, contrariwise, just threats and maledictions of God, for that they are thingp tending to idolatry and superstition. The thiditem is l these words:-
"3. Item, That suchmes as they know in a of tiheir cures tobe or have been wsabused withI fl,,g4,.or offari °ofanything made thereunto,oroha rahal
they,i (an nmoOne 6ther tivatpersonsho% for the aviig fta mnost do sen ofto okut O

Itis clear fbat in this passage Images are spokenofasimag 3 of persons, and that 'only suCh imsges of aDy kind as had been or houald be the subject of superstitiou" worship wera toberemoved; anditshowsthatthehighaltar was to remaias fi had been before, with lights upon it, before the acrament, The 19th section?rovldes thatno person shat
change thie order or maner of common prayer, or Divine service, otherwise than is secfied In these injunctions until such time as the same shall bo otherwlse ordered by the King's authority. The 21st section provides for reading certain portions of scripture in English in the time of Eigh Mas. The 28th injunction is in these terms:-
28. Also, that they shall take away utterly extinct. and destroy all shrines, covering of mArines,al tables candlesticks, trindles or rolls ot way, pictures, aintings. and al other monuments of feigned miracles, pilgrimsaes idolatry, And superstition, so that there remain no memory of the same in walls, glss windows. or elsewhere within their churches or houses, And they shall exhort all their palrishioners to do the like within their several houses. And that the churchwArdens, at the common charge of the parishioners in every church, shall provide a comely and
.onest pulpit, to heset in a convenient plae within the same for the preaching of God's Word."
If this section be read in connexion with those which precede it, it is obvious that it applies only to articles which had been the object of feigned miracles, pilgrimages, idolatry, and superstition, and at all events could not include either crosses or images which had not been so abused, and which by the previous injunctions were to be retained; and, as regards the cross itself, its use was not only permitted, but enjoined, as the old services which required it were retained. The section could not mean that aU candlestcks should be removed from churche
for two were to be retained on the high altar. Still less could it maean that all tables, candlesticks, and pitures should be removed from private houses. Thai this is the true meaning of the injunctions is fartheshown by the Articles of Visitation, in which inquiry was to bo made whether they had been obeyed. The article applicable to this subject Is as follows:-
"Whether there do remain not taken down in your churches, chapels, or elsewhere, any misused imag with pilgrimages, clothes, stones, shoes, offering, issin candle. sticks, trindles of wax, and such other like; a rwhether there do remain not delaied and destroyed any shrines coverznn of shrines, or any other monunment of idolatry, superstition and hypocrisy. '-Cardw., .Doc Ann., p. 25. Anotheriu I s
" Whether they which have spoken and declared anything for the setting forth of pilgrimages, feigned relics, images, or any such superstition, have not openly recanted the same.C=ardw., Doc. Ann., p. 27.
The object of these injunctions appears to have been to abolish the worship or superstitious veneraMtion of images and reles; but they left entirely untouched the service of High Mass, and made no declaration as to the nature of the sacrnment then administered. Indeed, a subsequent ro clamation of the King, dated the 27th of December, 1047, forbids any discussion of the doctrine of the real presence until the King should define the doctrine. On the 6th of February, 1548, N.S., the ig issued a proclamation by which purtAshment was denounced against such persons as should of t eir private mind omit, leave done, change, alter, or innovate any order, rite, or ceremony commonly used and frequented in the Church of England, ana not commanded to be left done inthoreignofthe late King, other than such as Edward VI., in manner therem mentioned, had ordered or should order to be altered; pro. vided always tbat no man should be punished for omitting certain particular obeeriances therein mentioned, and, -among others, for noe creeping to the cross. The ceremony of creeping to the cross seems be explained by a constitation Of Gies de Bridport, Bishop of Aarum, A.D. 1246 (Wilkinse Conciiau, voL i, I. 713), which provides that on the day of our Savior's .taesion al the parish "shall come to worship the cross and offer according to their inclinations." In Strype's Memoriabs of Oranmer the practice is alluded to in these terms:-" And because creeping to the cross was a greater abuse than any of the others (for there the people said ' Crucom tuam adoramus, Domine ' " and the Ordinsl said, "Precedant clerlic ad crucem adorandam nudis pedibus," anditfolloweth in the said Ordinal, ' Poratur crux ante aliquod altare bi a populo adoretur," which by the bishop's book, entitledA NYIcarnstructon, is against the Second Commandment, therefore he, the arhbishop, desired of the King that creeping to the cross might also cease hereafter." (Strype's Mem, voL i p. 299.) It is plain, therefore, that up to this time the use of the cross wfas permitted, though mtsused images wrere, in the strongest and most general terms, forbidden. On the 21st of February, I548, N.S., however, another proclamation was issueo, upon the authority of which it is contended that all images, including crosses, were to be taken down. It is in these terms:-
"After our right hartye recommendations to your good Lordship; where now of late in the King's Majesties visitation, amonge other godlye injutetions commaunded to be generally observed tbroughe all partes of this his Eighnes realme, one was set forthe for the taking downe of all suche images as had at any tyme ben abused with pilgrimages, offeringee, or censinges; albeit that this said injunction hathein manypartes of the realme been wel and quyetlys obeyed and executed, yet in many other places muche stryfe andoontentyon hath risen anddailyriseth, and more andmore encreaseth about the exeecution of the same, some men beyng so superstytyous or rather vylfull, as they wold by
heyr good wylles rethyne al suche images styli, althouga they have been mooste manyfestlye abused, and in some places also the Images whiche by the aside injunctions were taken downe be now restored and set up againe, and almoste in every place ys contentyon for images, whether they have been-abused or not; and whiles these men go about on both sides contentyouslye to obtains theyr mmindes, contending whether this or that image hath been offered unto, kyssed, censed, or otherwyse abused, partyes have in some places ben taken in suche sorte, as further inconvenyence is very like to ensue yf remedie be not provided in tyme ; considering therefore that allmost in no places:of this realme ys any sure quyetnets but where al images be hoolly taken sway and pulled downe already, to the intent that all contentyon In everye part of this realme for this matter may a e clerely taken away, and that the lyvely images of Clryste shulde not contende for the deadeimages whiche be thing not necessary, and without whiche the churches of hrlst cont)nued mtost godlye many yeres: We havo thouht good to sigify unto you, that his highnes pleasure with th' advyse and consent of us the lord tectour and the reste of the counsell ys, that immeately upon the sight herof, with as convenvent diligence as you maye, you shall not onely gyve ordre, that all the Images remayninge in any churche or chappell within your dlocese be removed and taken away, but also by your letters signifye unto the reste of the bu,shopes within your provynce his highnesae pleasure for the tyke order to be gveu by thenm and every of them, within thelr several dioceses; and in th' execution thereof we requyre bothe you and the rest of the busshopes foresayd, to use suche foresight as the sAme may bo quyetlye donne with as good satisfaction of the people as may be."
It appears to thelrLordships that this proclamation applies only to such images as are the subject of the former proclamation, and that the intention was not to introduce within the prohibition articles of a description not before forbidden, but to do aswy with the distinction between images which had been, and images which had not been, abused. This prodamation, any more than the former could not tply to crosses, for the old services were at in use. The A4t establishing the new Book of Common Prayer did not pass till.near a twelvemonth afterwards, and that Act itself providesthatfor acertain term after its date the oldeeremninies should continue. This is confirmed by the proclamation issued on the 13th of May, 1548, by which clergymen were enjoned to teach the people on the one hand " to flee all old erroneous superstitions, as the confidenoe in pardons, pilgrimages, beads, religious images, and other such of the Bishop of Rome's traditions and superstitonwith his usurped power, which things be herein this realm moat justly abolshed," and then, on the otherhand, "straitly to rebuke those who will take upon them to run before they be sent, to go before the rulers, and to alter and change things m religion without authority." 'Itis deolared that it is not a private man's duty to alter ceremonies, to innorate orders inthe church, nor yet is it a preacher's part to bring that into contempt and hatred which the Prince doth either allow or is content to suffer."-(Cardwell, Doc. Anna Tp. 65.) The next authority relied on is the 3d and 4th EdRward VL, chap. 10, entitled " An Act for the Abolishing and Putting away divers Books and Images." The object of this Act was to enforce the observance of the now Prayer-Book, and of former orders with respect to image.
er enactng that all Antiphonals and other books of the services of the church other* than the authorized PrayerBook shall be utterly abolished it proceeds to enact that if ny person shall have such bookcs in his possession, or any images of stone, thniber, alabaster, or earth,graven,carved, orpainted,whichheretoforehave beentaken out f any
cnurch or chapel, or shalt stand in any churobhor chapel, nd do not before the last day of June then next ensuing deface and destroy the images, and deliver up the books for the purpose of being destroyed, such persons failin to deliver up the boos shall be subject to certain penallic ; but it inflicts no penalty on persons failing to deface or destroy the images, nor does itin terms order their destruction or defacement. No doubt, however, it implies that, to retain them is illegal, but it relates in their Lordahips
opinion to thc destruction of images already ordered tobe removed, but which either had not been remnoved, or, having been so, were stil retained for private veneration and wo - Ehip; and the images so described, for the reasons alreay s.isgned, cannot include crosses. The letter of King Edward 'VI. to Cranmer, directing him to give effect to this Ac., refers only to books, sayiug nothing as to Images. fus, mnatters remained as regarded the law upon the sub,tno
in question until thPe enud of the reign of Edward VL,for, although most important alterations were made an the ord, r of Divine service by the -5th and 6th of Edward VI., cha
1, and the new Prayer Book thereby introduced, they *ppy only, le the former3Prayer Book, to that which was to b use lan the services adritez of the church. Bat although their Lordships areof opinion that the law did not requiue theremoval fro ichurches of croes merely assuch, both Books of Common Prayer had excluded them from se in the servies. They were no longe to be employoi; and nothing is mnore probable, erefore, tha tham they could be tuaned to any. profit they would. be ma 'e the subject, either of ate, or robbery, and thet in tieo pop r disturbanceshich accompaniedt te great ohage in the religion of the nation, and in many cases auticipat d and outran the acts Of the Government, crosses would. ishae the fate of images; so that between the fanaticism, of t1e popullac and the cupidity of thLe courtiersa the Ornaments of tho churches, in every mense of that termn, would-be santjectto polatin ad dstrctin.

OD: the acoesion of - Qneen ary,. all the Old sLpestitions were testoed and bths Actg of Parliament to whichl we have referred were repealed.- The images which had not been taken down remained, and many which had been taken downwee restored. On the -accession of Eliabeth, in the year i558 ; the :atatutes of XQueen Mary on these matters wers reele the sipretae-Crown waagestablbed by'the Act fthe1St of Ezaeh, chap 1, and all such juris. diction in apirLitual iftters as hither had been or lawftlly might be exercisedhy any sprtualor elesiatcal authority was armixed to- the Crown of England, and power was given totheQucen anda her sucessors to appoint commismaissioners for the purpose of exerci sing ecclesiastical jurisdiction. By the 1st of Elizibeth, chap. 2, the woond Prayer-book of Edwad VI,, with certain alterations, was is-established, iWanctions were issue, snd articles of visitation framed, much tothe same effect with those already pronaiulgated in the 'reig of Edward VL. but which do not appear to their Lordship to extend the prohibition with respect to images. It isnowi, indeed, that at this time peat differences of opinion prevailed among the early reformers with respect to the useof crosses and cracifixes, and that the Queen was favourable to the uso of both; that she setained them in her own chapel, and although they were removed for a time in consequence of the remonstrances made to her, they were afterwards restored. (Cardw, Doc., Ann., 268.) But a great distinction was made
etwreen the cross and the crucifx, and the use oftheformer might well be permitted, while the other was forbldden.
ts is very mamfest from the letter of George Caander to Bishop Cox, dated at Worms, 1560, printed In the second serlesof theZuridl lZctrs, p. 43. Hethereexpreseshim. self in these terms-
" I understand that you are not altogether agreedamong yourselves with respect to the setting up the image of the cross or the crucifix In the church; but I do not sufficiently understand whether this queston refers to the mere figure of a cross, or also to the image of Christ hanging pon it. I have seen here a certain print which contined a croes only in tho middle, with some text of holy Scripture written on each aide; whence I supect that your question only refera to the figze of the cross.
Your Excellence is aware in what frequent use and in vhat peat esteem the figure of the cross was held among the early Christians, insomuch that it wa everywhere placed and represented in their buildings, sacred and profane, public and private, and this, too, before the practice of setting ap other imagesin the churches, whether of Christ himself or of the saints, had tome intouse; that on the destruction of al monuments of idolatry, by which everything was defiled, the figure of the cross, which was as it were a sacred symbol of Christianity, succeeded under better auspices into their places. And like as the word cross in the writing of the angelist an. Apostles mystically signiiies the passion, death, and triumph of Chist, and the aflictions of the saints, so also bytbefiuro of the cross everywhere setmup nd meethng the eye they intended all these things to be set forth, as it were, by a mystic symbol and infcre in men's minds;wvherefore thej nradeioxjnstd s- tinc'iou between the figure or repreetation of the cross, andall otherimages."
Of the cross thas used Cassander signiiies his xpproval That many of the English bishops objected both to crosses and crucifiese, and either ordered or sanetioned their removal from churches within their dioceses, and that in many othen they were defaced or destroyed by the violence of tho people, can adjuit of no doubt; and that this violence exended also to monuments In churches appears by a froclamation Issued by Qaeen Elizabeth against defacers o monuments in the year 1560; for it spealcs of these proceedings as "ia slander of sauch as in ffmes pest had in charge only todeface monuments of Idolatry and false feigned images in churches and abbeys:" expressions which tend strongly to confirm the meaning their Lordships have already attibuted to the injunctions and Act of Parliament of Edward VL Upon the whole their Lordshi
after the most anxious consideration, hxve come to the concluson that cros as uished from crucifixes, have been inuseas ornaments of churohes from the earliest rods of Christianity ; that when used as mere emblems of the Chrisstiant faitl:, and. uot as objects of superstitious reverence, they may still lawfully be erected as architectural decorations of churches- that the wooden crosg erected on the chancel screen of gt. Barnabas is to be considered as a mere architectur ornament - and that as to this Article they must advie Her Majesy to reverse the judgment complained of. The laws in force respecting the consecration of any bulldin for a church, and which forbid any subsequent alteration without a faculty from the ordinary, will be sufficient to prevent any abuse in this respect This desion, however, by no means dispos of the question as to crosses attached to communion tables, which it will be convenient to deal with in connexion with the altar at SL Barnabas, which is ordered to be removed. This article of church furnitare congsis of a thick marble slab, with a super-altare on t'he sadO nearest to the wal of the chapeL It stands apart from the wall, supported upon sdone carved arches, the arche resin upon a stone plintb, Which is let into and embedded in ta pavement on which it stands. The cross is attached to the supeo-altre, and stands between two large candlesticls, wbich;are moveable. The question is whether this structure is a communion tLble vithn the meaning of the law. The appellants, in their pleqdings, term these tables altars orcommunlon. tables; and i the argument theyv ave referred to two recent sttutes in which the word "altar" is used to signify the communionL table. Whenthe same thming is sifed it may not be of muchimpotanc by hat ame t is called; but the distinction tween an altar and a communion table is in itslf essential and deeply founded, in the most Important difference in -matters of faith between Protestants
ad Rouanists-vi., in the different notlons of the nature of the Lord's Supper which prevailed in the Roman Catholic church at the time of the Reformation, and those which were introduced by the Reformers By thie former it was considered as a sacrifice of the body and blood of the Saviour. The altar was the place onwhich the sacrifice was to be made; the elements were to be consecrated, and
bve' so consecrated, were treated as the actual body ana
blem of the vctim The Reformers, on the other hand, considered the Holy Communion, not as a sacrifice, but as a feast, to be celebrated at the Lord's Table; thougb as to the consecration of the elementsa and the effect of tl- consecration, and several other point they differed greatly amorg themselves. This distinction Is well pointed out in Cudwortlh's Di4course cerning the Tnc Nature of ake Lrdcrs Suipcpr, c. 5, p 27:-
"We see how the theological controversy which hath coat so many disputes,whether the Lord's Supper be a sacrifice, isalreadydecided;foritisnot'scrficium, but 'epulum de sacrificio; not a scrifice, but a feast u1pon sacrifice; or else, in-other words, not I oblatio sacrificli,' but, as Tertullian excellentlyspeaks, 'p"rtcipatio sacrificii!; not the offering of something up to God upon an altar, but the eating of something which comes from God's altar andis set upon our tables. Neither was it ever known among the Jews or heathens that those tables upon which they did eat the sacrifices should be called b the nrame of altars therefore he (St Paul) must needs call the communion table by the name of the Lord's table^e c*-, the table u
which God's meat is eaten, not his altar upon which it is offered."
That the Roman Catholie alars are constructed with a view to this doctrine of sacrifice admitsof nodoubt. Cardinal Bona speaks of them in these terms:-'9De Altan-
bus Novi Testamenti agendum eAt in quibus corporis et san. guinis Christi sacficium incruentum immolatur."-Lib. i, chap. 20, page 251. W-ith respect to the question, what is =reqired to constitute a Roman Catholic altar, we have been furnished with valuable information by- a treatise entitled Institutifrnes Liturga-m ad wumm &miinarii Rom%ni, by, Fornici, the present text-book of the Pope's Seminary. In thefirstpart, "De Sacrifcio Mss b"cbap 3, pagep 18, iD Altari e3usque ornata," it is Id down in the first place
nunquamextraaltarehoetiamnimmolarMY Itisthenstated that altars originally were made indifferehtly of wood or stone, but that many centuries *a the church ordered that they should be only of stone. Te term altar is thus explained:-" Nomine autem altaris intelligitur sUerficies plana ad saezificinm Misea immediate deputata." Ttealtar is to be in the church; it is to be fixed and immovable, " immobile seu fixum definitum super suis pedibus son base quod habet totam integram superficdem seu mensam smperioren ;" and it is requirod to be " lapideum et ab episcop
consecratum" The treatise then proceods to state that by most ancient usage, as earl as the Council of Tours, in the year 667, the standard of the cross, "vexillum crncis," was to be placed in the middle of the altar; it states that by the term " cross" is meant the crucifix - and it refers to two noriparatively modern declarations on the subject by the Holy See, one in 1746, and another in 1822, by which orders are given with respect- to the size and position of the cracifix on altars It then refers to the lights upon tho altar --"Ad utrnmque cracis latus creunm in MWisas sacmificio accendi jubet ecolesla," p. 22; and it refers to the rubric by which it is ordered:- Coliocetur crx et candelabra saltem duo." Such, then, as regards its form, is the Roman Catholic altar. A stone structure fixed In the church, and immovable, with a plane surface or snensa, on which the unbloody sacrifice (" sacriicium in-
craentaum") mnay beoffered; on which t e host and the .&Jhosi et calix") may be placed; with a crucifix
woadesticks, as essential adjuncts to it. At the date of the firt P~rayer-book of Edward VI. the doetrine of the EugliFh church as to the reAl presence and the natuare of the HmolY Communion was undecided; the book therefore enjoined no c'hange in the form of the altar, but spoke of the rite itself as the Lord-s Sutpper, commonly caled. the high masw, and of the structure mdifferently by the names of the altar and the Lord's Table. It contains a prayer for the onusecration of thea sacred 'elements, in which the signi of the cross Is -to be used. The bread is to beunxleavened, and round asit wagsaforetime, The core~oras,the
pten, the chalice, the vestments are all articles directed to beusedinthe Roman Catholic ritual, and spoken of by those names In the missal. But by the time when the ceconad Prayear-book -was introduced a great c'hange had taken place in the opinion of thLe English church, and the consequeLcce Was, that on the revision of the service thwes several maatters were completely alteredl; the use of a surplice was substitute for the several -vestments previously enjoinedl; the prayer f-or oonsecrtion of the elements was omitted thiough in thep resent Prayer-book it is restored; the bread and wine deliveted to thes comimunicants weree no- longer described as the body and blood of, Christ, asz was the case in the first Prayer-book ; the table was no longer spoken of as the altar, but as the Lord's table, or as God's boxard; andathe table is to have, at thl tiMfe of thq~commhni6n, a fair white linen cloth uponi it, Iand -ix -toastand in the body of the church or in ths ehineel, ivhere morning gr#er and eyenin%'pralier are ap-

The ld canon of 1601, that which Is now In force, introducees no material alters. tions. It assmes the existence inall churches of convenient and decent tables for the celebration of the Holy oammnunlon, and provides that they shall be kept in repair. It orders that the table be covere oin time of Divine servioe with a carpet of s l or other decent stuff thought meet by the ordinary, and at the time of the ministrAtion with a fair linen cloth, As becometh that table. Since this period no alteration has bqen made by the aw with respect to the nature of the table to be used. The rubric of the present Prytr-book provides only that at the communion time the table, having a fair white linen cloth upon it, shall
tamd In the body of the churcB, or chancel whero morngmg and evenig prayer is Appointed to be said; and the priest is to commenco the ser sto anding at the north side of the table. The term "a iltar" ls never used to describe it, and ther is an express d aoolration at the close of the servioe against the doctrine of transubstantiation, with which the ieas of an altar ond s tarifice are closvly connected. Under these circumstances the first question is whether the stone structure at St. Ramrabas ig a communion table within the meaning of the canons and the rubric; and their Lordshitm are clearly of opinion thlatt itis not. The caeris within the principle of Sir . Jeuner Fust's decision, in " Faulkrner v. Lichfielal" (3 Notes of Cass, 55) ; from which, indeed, the present proceeding istin effectian spyevor ing in elaborate judgment in that case the whole subjecors ofuscosed with a earning and ability which make It usteles on the present occasion to go further than their Lordships have already done, Into the authorities. The decree odmpl-ined of in the Apeal of" Liddellf it T a f,
has ordered tho church or chape wardens of St. Barabas to remove the present structuttre of stone used as a commnotaIand to provide instead thereof a mnoveablo tal o - Their Lordships ha at first some doubt whether the law bhad prescribed of what material the table should be madle; but on furthier consideration they are satisfied that the opinioni expressd by Sir H. Jenner Fuast and ado tedithe dece in this cas is well founded. The term " ebli," and the corresponding Latin word Itmensa," especiaiy when it isconsidera for whstpurpose it was to be used, naturally importsa table of the masterial of which tables are ordinarily made. The communion table was to be provided by the parish wras to be moveable, ntot by machinery, butt by hand an'was Actually to be very frequently moved. Wood is a lighter and cheaper material than stone, and the circumstance that the old altar was 'necessarily of stono would be an additional reason with the Reformers for rei'ring that the table should be of wood. The canons of 1.p.I rvd hti hl eo tha~t material-" mons pe de thbasco atosita shcallb ofAn although those canons, not hivingroev h a assnd, were not of themselves of binding force, it is probable that
b they eregerall,v acted upon, and they sufficiently show wawaat that time undergtood to be the proper material of the table which, under the Act of Elizabeth and the regulations of Edward VI, was to be substituted for the altar. The canons of 1604, which are now in force, do not contain any provision upon this point. They speak of the communion tables as things which alreadiy exist in parish churches, and provide for their re-
si,and give 3minute directions as to the coverigto be used. If anyv doubt had existed aLt that tieas to thoe material of the table itself it is not probable that the canons would have omit,ted allnoticeo oft quston, Their Lordships therefore, are satisfied that the decason upon this point in " Fanumer v.Lchfleld" is well founded, and they must advise Her Miajesty that the decree as to the removal of the stone structure At St. Barnabas and the cross upon it. and the substitution of a comnmunion table of weed, ought to be affirmed. Next, with respect to the woodenx cross attached to the communion table at St. Paul's. Their Lordships have alreadyv dcclsred their opinion that the communion table Intended by the canon was a table in the ordinary sense of the word, fliat and moveable, capable of being covered with a cloth, at which or arounid which the communicants might be placed in ore toptae f the Lord's Supper, and te queTio swhte the existence of a cress attached t the table is consistent either with the spirit or with the letter of those regulations. Their Lordships are clearly of opinion that it is not, and they must recommend that upon this pont Also the decree complained of should be affirmed. It mnay be urged, andl indeed was urged with great force by counsel at the bar, that in modern usage the communion table never, in fact, Is moved; that the general adoption of rails to fence off the table from the rest of the church shows that its removal is never contemplated; and that if it is not to be moved it is useless to require it to be moveable ; that if it be in such a form that a suffcient portion of it nmay be covered with a -'fair lien cloth to receive the sacred elements it is idle to insist on the whole being caable of being covered. To these observations the answer, Mtht the distinictioni between a-n altar and a table is in itself essential that the circumstances, therefore,J which constitute the distinction, howvertrilin intheseles,areforthat reason imrtat; nd hatwhe poitie rlesare established by l~~wcouts f jstie, hencaled ntoaction by parties entited o mintin hesui, ae bundtoenforce the law as themfin it leaingit o th Leislture ifit eesfit, in any annr toaltr i. Th net qestin i asto the
creO nce-tables. Here the rubrics of the Prayer-book become important. Their Lordships entirely agree with the opinions expressed by the learned judges in these cases, and in "Faulkner v. Lichfield," that in the performanee of the services rite3 and ceremonies ordered by the Pray r-book the directions contained In it must be strictly obsorved; that no omission and no addition can be permitted; but they are not prepared to hold that tho use of all articles not
expressly mentioned in the rubric, although 'uite con-
sistent with and even subsidiary to the servioc, is forbidden. Organs are not mentioned, yet, because they are auxiliary to tho singing, they are allowed. Pews, cushions to kneel upen,C pulpit-cloths, hassocks, seats by the comumunion table, are in constant use, yet they are not mentioned in the rubric. Now, what is a credence-table ? It is
simply a small side table on which the bread and wine are, placed before the consecration, having no connexion with any superstitious usage of the church of Rome. Their renroval has been ordered on the ground that they are adjuncts to an altar; their Lordships cannot but think that tboy are more properly to be regarded as adjuncts to a communion table. The rubric directs that, at a certain point in the course of th communion service (for this is, no doubt, tbe true meanlnu of the rubric); the minister sball placo
the bred ad dwino en th commurnion table, but whero they are to be placed previously is nowhero stated. In practice they are usually placed on the oommunion,table before tho
commencement of the service, but this certainly Pis not according to the order prescribed. Nothing seems to be less objectionable than a small side-table, from which they may be conveniently reached by tho officiating minister, and at the proper time transferre4dto the communion table. As to the reieneo-tables their Lordships, therefore, must advise a revers d of the sntenoe complained of. Next, as to the einbroldered cloths, it is sAid that th canon orders a ooverIng of silk, Or of some other proper material, but that it does thot mnOutio and therefore by implication excludes mdere than oe covering. Their Lodip are unable to adopt thisO ctoalution. An order thata table shall always
be. Qored wlith a cloth x Trly
tWA6alalways be covered 'with thosm lt rwt
cloth of the samne colour or tadltr. The object of this canon seems to be to secure &-^toth otfa suficiently hand. sone description, Ot to' gntd ainst toolnuch splendour. In practice, as was justly obseorved at the bar, black cloths are in many chuches used duna Lent, and on the death of the Sovergign, and some other occasions, and there seems notoing objectionLblo in the practice. Whether 'the cloths so dresuitable ornotisa mattertobeleftto the dizi. cretion of tho ordinary. In this ease their Lordship. doiot see any sufficlent reason for interferenoe, and they maus
therefore advise the reversal of the sentenco as to the cloths vsed for the covering of the Lord's table during the Vitne of Divine service, both with respect to St. Paul's and 't
St. Barnabas. The lut quegtion is with rosect to the embroidered linen and lace used on the communion table at the timo of the minishtration of tho Holy Communion. The rubric and the canon prescribe the mse of a fair white linen cloth, and both the learned judges inthe cotirt Below have been of opinion that embroidery and lame are not cobnsstent with the meanlng of thatexpression, having regard to the mature of the table upn which the cloth is to e used.AlloahterLM parnodipsdi y case to rtrirthinna rrower limitsthant any

In whioh the suit Was Instituted to restrain the defendtsn from carrying their line over a part of the Manchestr and Buxton turnpike road, so as to interfere with a branch road rvuning from Bugsworth. The merits of the case princi. pally depended on the dAtes at which the branch road was made and the Stockport Railway contemplated andad. vertised. These dates, as far as material, were as folows
The road was begun in 1850, and finised, to within aboutt 200 yards of the Manchester and Buiton turnpike road, in 1852. In 1853 the Stockport Railway issued its advertisement and depoeited its plans. In 1854 the formation of the Bugsworth road was suspended for want of funds, but was subsequently, in 1855, completed, the last portion of it being constructed in such a manner as to render it im. possible for the Stoekport line of railway to be carried out agreeably to its plans, as deposited. 'Under these cireumstances, the question arose as to whether the Bogs. worth road was or was not entitled to hold its ground against the Stockport Railway, and the Court held it was not. The trustees of the road were in a condition to know, before they oommenced the continuation of tbo road, that it would, as at present oonstracted, impede the line of railway which the directors were entitled by Act of Parliament to make, and, with this knowledge, the trustees had no right to come to a course of equity for relief.-Injunction refused.

This casue cae on upon an adjourned Enmons under these circumstances :-This sdt was instituted to admin. ister the estate of Samuel Burke, who left aU his pronty to tru stees, and, intcr atia, a certain piece of leasehold land with a cotton mill thereon, in the neighbourhood of Manchester, and held under a lease from Manchester College. A receiver was appointed in the suit, who, in 1846, entered into a provisional agreement with Mr . Ireland to grant a lease or the samepremises, according to a p lan then existing, subject to the approval of the Court, and there were covenants to repair, with certain exceptions, including damage by fire, whereas the original lease contained no such exceptions. In 1853 a renewed lease was granted of the premises, including in this parcel certain now buildings erected bylreland, andotherwise the snme as the first lease; and, ashe raiEed the question of his right to remove such buildings,an injunction was obtained to restrain such removal, and on motion to dissolve that inumnction an undertaking was given which resulted in a referenco to chambers as to whether it was beneficial to grant any and what lease to Ireland in pursuance of the a.grooment.Tbe chief clerk had certifiedthat It would 'ce benefial,sad this case now came on upon an objection to such reference,on the ground that the lease agreed to be granted to Ireland placed him in such a different position from the original lessee that, although he performed all his covenants, yet he might be evicted from the premises by the supenor landlord.
Mr. Eddes appeared in opposition to tho chief clerk's certificate; Mr. arslake supported it; and Mr. Bazalgette for other paLrties in the suit.
The VxCx-CnANCnLoE. thought that the trustees were not in a condition to give Mr. Treland such a leae as was contracted to be kiven to him by the agreement of1846. As a general proposition, upon the tendency of the authori. ties as the law now stood, a lessee of premises might during the currency of the term remove any buildings or fixtures merely applicable for the purposes of trade. Now, on looking at the covenants of the proposed demise, there was nothin In them to abrogate that nght which Mr. Ireland certain had as between him and his lessor. The question
then, waswhotherthe orighial and renewed lesesclasbed with those oovenants ? Certainly they did, because if Mr. Ireland pulled down any trade buildings it would forfeit the original or renewed lease, becauso the covenants were general to leave all the buildings in good repair and indeed an inunction was asked on that ground The trustees, thereore, oould not grant sach lease as thoy had contracted to grant, and the chief clerk's certificate was not correct.

This causo came on upon further directions, inquiries having been directed to the Master in July, 1848, with reference to cerin charity property belonging to a gentleman laamod Hanbury, who by 1 deeds, enrolled according to law, gave various sums of money, amounting by accumula tion to about 6001 por annum at present, for various charI. table.purposes, such as the purchaso of organ6, beef, the building of a cathedral, &c., and in one case directina that the sum of 1001. should accumulate until it produced r,ooa.
er annun, the donor dying in the year 1779. The heir-at. I an otber parties called in question the legality of these transactions, and the matter now came on upon the Master's report
Mr. Sw,anston and Mr Schomberg appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. aily, Mr. Glasse, Mr. De Gex, Mfr. Ware, and
fr. Borton appeared for the other parties; Mr. Wickens apppared for the Attorney-General.
The VICE-CIAN"CELLOR said, at present the Master had not stated of what the property consisted- there must, therefore, be an inquiry of what the property devoted to cbaritable purposes consisted at Mr. ilanbury's death, and of what it now consisted. Until this was known it would be premature to direct any scheme.

RE MiEEiONLTHsRBB SLAM AND SLATE SLAB COMPANY.
EX PARTE RY)L
Mr. Ssnm, on behalf of Mr. Thomas Rye, moved by way of appeal from a decision of the Master placing the name of Mr. Rye on the list of contribories of the bove company, that the same should be struck off such list. In November, 1846, Mr. Rye, in accordance with his own application, became an alottee of 30 shares in the hierienethihire Slate and Slate Slab Company, on which, in December, 1846, a deposit of Is per share was paid on his account The company was completely re istered and the deed of settlement executed in February, 1847. Two calls of 10s each per share having been made between February and July, 1847, and the same not having been paid nor the deed of settlement signed by Mr. Rye, his sharcs were, in the latter month, declare4 to bo forfeited. In 1849 an order to wind up the affairs of the company under the Joint-Stock Winding-up Acts was obtained, and in December, 1856, MirRye's name was placedon the list of contributories. Before the learned counsel had concluded his opening,
Mr. MALXLs (with whom was M. Roxburgh), for the official manager. said that, as it would be impoesiblo to finish the case to-day he hoped his Honour would alowit to stand over until 13ster Term, as from his PIr. Mains's) engagements next week he would be unable to be ln court.
Mr. SarTsTx expressed his perfect readiness to coneur in any arrangement which might be mnade to suit the convenience of Mr. Malins.
The VIoE-CsTuNczLLOR accordingly directed the motion to stand over until Easter Term.
No other motion occurred during the day requiring a report.

CROWN COURT.-(Before ir. JT=ticc W1LIIAisS.)
CHARGE OR, MURDIR.
laugh Orr was indicted for the wilful murder of Edward Dev,e, on the high seas, on the ad of July last.
Mr, Slade and Mr. Kingdon were counsel for the prose. cutiorn; Mr. Coleridge and Mr. Bullar for the prisoner.
A case of such fearful cruelty and atrocity as detailed in the opening of this case was, perhaps, scarcely ever heard. The prisoner, a fine-looking man, was the captain of a vessel called the Hannah Jane, of about 120 tons' burden. The deceased was a black man, a native of Boston, in the United States about 32 years of age, and was engaged as cook in the ship. The crew oftheship consistedof the captain, six men, and a boy. In February, 1856, the vessel sailed from London to Newcastle for a cargo of coals, and then proceeded to Senegal, then to Cape Verde Islands, to Rio Grande, and then back to England. While they were in the Senegal river the captain commenced a most extraordinary series of ecuelties-beating and flogging the cook day by day for four ,weeks until, becoming weaker and weaker from these crelties, death, more morciful than his persecutor, relived him from his sufferings on the 3d of July. He was beaten by the captain and the mate with ropes, with broom handles, and with a " cat," and when his back was raw he wvas scrubbed with a brush. The poor fellow ueed to cry for mnercy, and called upon the crew to come and help him, but the crew dared not interfere. When the vessel reached Rio Grande the crew informed the consul there of the treatment the cook had received, and of his death, but he said he could not do anything in the matter. The ship arrived at Plymouth in December, and then an inquiry was instituted, which ended in the captain being sent to prison for trial. The following is a detail of the ovidence.
John Reddington,-I am the deputy shipping master of the register at Plymouth. In December the prisoner delivered to me his shipping articles, which are signed by the prisoner. The name of the vessel was the Hannah Jane, the captain was the prisoner, and Devue was cook and steward. The prisoner aiso handed me the log; *in it is entered the death of the cook on the 3d of July. I believe
ethe entry to ham in the prisoner's handweriting. The entry is
in these d wor.dsCreY.- t O I G e OSdo thty At 7 30
There is another entry:
" ] Cook died July 3 I don't u now the cause, id not the eu lk 1 It appears that Atwell the mate, desarted at Rio Grandhm
trederickt Johnse.- am the shippieg-master at Pl,ymoutri. Thologbook, uc., wane handed to nem. I exammed the logboou , and then causee itquiry to be made into the deith
ot Devso. I communicated with the Board of Trade uson
the subject. I told the prisont r the entries in the logbook
were not satisfaetory to he, and I desired to mako farther
qrederidtook thendepositions of theicrew, ant I forwarded thevt the BoarmuofcTrade. Th trisnor brought Connuto my office, as the prisoner had made heavy charges of fines against Devue, amounting to 401., for breakages. I asked Conn whether he had seen the cook ill-used by the captain, and he told me that he had seen the mate ill-use him very much. He appeared inclined not to say much. I went on board the Hannah Jane. I went into the cabin, and Appleby, one of the crew, made a loud noise at the forergging, which I distinctly heard.
Cross-examined.-Conn told me the cook had broken mnany things, and that the mate had tied up the cook by the heels with his head down and beat him till his tongue hung out and blood came from his mouth, and that the prisoner was in the cabin at the time. There was a dispute between the prisoner and A pleby about wags. Th
prisoner refused to pay him what hPe claimed. There was no inquiry as to the death of the cook until after that question was settled. The prisoner told me he had put one or two of his crew in prison at Cork on the home voyage, on the 5th of December, as they had been fighting and stabbing each other, and stealng some pork out of the ship.
Re-examined.-There was no difference between the prisoner and Harver.
Edward Codd.-I am superintendent of police at Plymouth. On the 29th of December I took the prisoner into cmstody on board his vessel. The next day I went with Appleby on board the vessel. In the cabin Appleby found a cat under the cot; in the other cabin he found a portion of a brush. From a oupboard he took out a piece of rope with an iron ring at the end, called a "lizard." On the 31st I went on board again, when Conn showed me a chest in the day cabin. He unlocked it and I took out a bottle, and Appleby gave me two ropes. Appleby went to the galley. I was near the wheel. Appleby was to call out as if a person were in pain. Conn, who was in the cabin, could hear the cries.
Cross-examined.-I did not see Appleby on the day I arrested the prioner. The cabin was rather in disorder. The cupboard was full of cordage. I read the warrant to the prisoner, who said he had been before the consul, but did rot mention where, as to wages and that the men had said to a young man that they woulA do for him; that the men said he had poisoned a cook with some medicine.
Be-examiped.-He did not mention that Coni was the person who old him. Conn said he had received five doses of that medicine that was given to the cook.
Thomas Appleby.-I was a seaman on board the Hannah Jane. Atwe was mate. Haver, PhilHps, and Frazer were seamen. Edward Davue was cook and eonn was cabinboy, We sailed from London in February, and took in coals at Newcastle. Phillips deserted there, and we took Jarvis in his place. The cook was ill there for two days. The captain gave him some medicine. We then sailed for the Senegal river, which we reached in three or four weeks. We discharged cargo there, and Jarvis deserted. We set sail for the Cape Verde Isands. The captain went on shore and remained all night. He returned about noon
next day. He then called the cook aft into the cabin. A-fter he had been in the cabin he camne out, anad
the captain knocked him down with his fist by a blow on
the head. While down he kicked him five or six times
about the body. The captain was swearing very much. He then took a rope off the winch, and beat the cook with it as he was lying down. The cook cried out" Murder "' We then set sail for Rio Grands, in the Brasila Isaw the captain on deck, and the mate beat the cook with a broom. stick over the legs, asking what his dishes were doing there. The captain could see them, but said nothing. The next day I saw the captain beat the cook several times with a piece of rope as he was going along the deck. I was at the wheel that night. I could see into the cabin; the prisoner and the cook were there. I saw the captain knock the cook down, and then take a hand brush and beat the cook with it on the head and body while he was lying down. This is the brush. The next day I saw the brnsh. the handle was broken off. The cook cried out for help, and asked if any one would come and help him. The captain said he dared any one to come there. A day or two after I saw the captain busy making a cat. I have seen the captain many a time givo the cook a blow with bis hand or a rope as he passed him on the deck, and the mnate did the same in the presenc of the captain. After the cat was made 1 saw the prisoner and the cook in the cabin. The prisoner knocld teo cook down with the handle of the cat, and then trAb,to put two half hitches or loops over the cook's thumbs, but he cound not do it. The mate came down, and then they tied the cook up tight to the locker, and then the captain flogged him with the cat. The cook had on only a shirt and pair of trousers. It was my duty at the wheel every other night. The next night I saw both the captain and mate flog the cook with the cats, as the mate had made another one. I have seen them flog him on the hare bask about ten days before he died. I saw that more than once. I saw him flogged every nilit. I was at the wheel for three weeks or a mohth, and I have heard cries in the cabin on the other nights. I saw his back twice. Once was the night before that on which he died. It had sores all over it; parts where you could see the skin all knocked- up, broken and raw. The night before that on
wilL he died I saw both the captain and mate floghim. *e{ was lashed'down to a chest by the thumbs, xo thai. his, back~ wasOunided. Icounted 352-lshes. (Great sensation.) I; hbae seen the cAptain beat him with-the lizard. He struck: hMm on the cheek with it nine days b'efore he died. It cut his cheek open. I saw the blood. Forabout 10 or, U daya the, cookwas nImsaing All bands looked for him.L We found him,on the cargo in tne hold. The mate pulled him out, and, then the captain took holdl of Mmn and pulled haim out of the hatchwayv, and they kicked him aft into the cabin, swearing, all the time. When they were in the cabin I heard cries forward. The day before the nigbt he died he was yig on the deck; the catainturnedhiuxover, andsaid, "Let'shave a look at you, orld darky;"' he tore his shirt right upad I .aw the back all over sores' The captain tol} othe y t
fetch the oil-can And he oiled the cook all over. The captain ordered the cook's chest to be brought up, And ha
ut a shirt upon him, and he told bim he might live in the lougboat or in the topgallant forecastle, wbhleh is an open place. The capttain gave hima a biscuit. r did not see the cook till 8o'clok at night; he then called for Jack vayer. I went and found the cook under the topgallant forecaste, lying i hlis clothes; he seemed very weak and very bad. I remained with him two hours. He asked for tea. I went to the mate for it, but could not get it. I went again about 4 o'clock in the morning, and. round him dead and stiff. I went and told thefmate. He was laid out on the deck. His legs vwre ter-~ ribly swollen, and his body was sores all over. There were marks of blows on his legs and back. He was in good health till the flogging commenced ; he walked strong enough. After the flogging he used to walk very lame and catch hold of asny rope as he walked along. I saw the pri soner pat a looking-glass to his mouth, when he said le had died ot the diarrhcea. His body was thrown overboard. We arrived at Rio about the 24th of JulY. I expressed a wish to the captain to gO to the consul, but he said he would not let me go there. I had heard the other men make a similar request. They wentornshorebeforeme. Thecaptainwenton shore before I went. I went with the prisoner to the consul, he had been to him before. I found the prisoner and the consul together. I told the consul about the cook, as I have told it here. The consul said he could do nothing in it, and that I must go onboard and attend to my duty. Mystatement to the consul was not taken downn m writing. I returned in the Hannah Jane to Plymouth. I had not observed that the cook was dirty till after his death.
C.ross-examined.-The cook used to sleep where the other menedid. I never obEerved any dirt about him. I never found anything unpleasant abouit him. The men did not tell the captain that the cook stunk so they could not bear him. I never knew him dirty himself. I never heard any one complain of his dirty ways. I never complained, and there was nothing to complain of. The mate left after we had come back from the consul's, nnd I then acted as mate. I told the same story to the consul that I have told to-day. I complained to the consul about the provisions. I did not say anything about this matter at Plymouth tll I was sent for-four or five days after our arriv.l. I had a dispute with tbe prisoner about wages, and It wai not till after that that I told. I don't know which gave the greater number of lashes, the captain or the mate; but they took turns at it. There wats a li ht in the cabin. The captain had treated him pretty weU until the beatings commenced. The captain made the cat openly. I never eard the captain give any reason for his conduct to the cook. I have seen him flogged on his hare back four or five times by both captain and mate. The cook cooked all the food till within two days of his death.
John liarver.-I was a eeaman on board the Hannah Jane. I remember the black cook. 'When we were waitimg for water at the bar of the Senegal river I saw the captain knock the cook about on the pnraiL. One day the catain had left his chronosteter on his bed. The cook went down to make the bed and moved the chronometer. The eatain beat him on the head with A handspike. The next day I saw the captain and mate beat the cook with the stave of a cask. I saw the captain making the cat with part of a broomstick and some cords, and that night I heard the oook crying out in the cabin. I was the owr.Tenx night I heard the cook cryigout in the cabiand Thent And looked, audi saw bt ati n aefogn the cook, who was lashed down to the handle of the captain's cheat by the thumbs. His shirt was pulled up and his trousers were pulled down, and he was flogged on the ba
back. The mate flogged him first and thecaptainafterwards. I saw this repeated every night. I was at the wheel, and that was every other night. I have seen his backcovered with sores. The Sunday before he clied h a ahdu
to the fore rigging, his heels higher thanhishead. The mate beat him with a broomstick. He was lashed by the neck and legs. I have seen him oiled by the cqtain, who orderedme to wcrubhim. Isaid 1couldisot doit, asIdid not like-his back was so sore. Coun cruAbbed bis back. He was flogged after that. Two daye before his death they gave him 300 and some odd lashes. His body was full of sores and bruises after his death. I went to the Consul at Rio Grande, and told him how the cook had been ill-used. He said he could do nothing in it, but would aend the case over to England.
Cross-examined.-I did not complain of the cook to the captain. He was not a dirty man. I did not speak about his dirt. There was nothing to complain of in the man. I will swear that no one asked the captain to have him removed from the forecastle. The Consulwould not listen to us much about what we said about the cook. We did iot accuse the captain of poisoning the cook. I once struckthe cook with my open hand because my dinner was not ready. Tbat was the only time I struck him. I was before the magistrates at Queenstown about a black man stabbing me, but I said nothing of this transaction. I know howto use my filts, but I neverpractied on the cook. At Plymou^h the prisoner wished to have the Consul sent for. I ceased to be friendly with the captain when we came to Plymouth because he wanted to dock my wg. I was very good friends with him when I told tho Consl he had murdered the cook.
Re-examined.-I did not interfere with the flogging, for fear of being put in irons.
Edward Coun.-I was a boy on board the Hannah Jane. U on one occasion, by the desire of the captain, I called to the cook, who was in the galle-. As soon as he came out the captain shook him and' knocked him down on the deck. Ee asked the captain not to beat him. I recollect the mate and the cook falling out, and the mate beat the cook in the cabin. I heard him cry, thou lh I was in the fore part of shp. (The witness then spoe in detail as to tie facts related by the other witnesses.F I scrubbed the cook's hack with sea water and a brush by order of the captain. The back was then all sore, and the cook complained of the pain, but the captain desired me not to mind his crying out. Upon one occasion I saw the captain and mate flog him, and I counted the lashes. The captain gave him 48 and the mate .366. The captain beat him with the cat and the mate with a plaited rope with knots in it. When he was dead the body was cut every where. The mate saw him lying on the deck the night before he died, and kicked him on the breast with his heavy sea boots, and he struck him with a large heavy bleck. I heard him moaning after this, but I never heard him sneak after thot. There was not a good smell In the forecastle when he was in it. I heard alawers and Frazer complain that the deceasedl was dirty, ansd the captain ordered him out of thie forecastle. The captain and the cook feU out about the stores being wasted. I have seen Hawera strike the cook with his flst.
Re-examined.-The man was clean till after he began to beobeat, and then hegfot dirty.
John W. Harris.-I am a surgeon of Exeter. I have been in the court and heard the detail of the treatment. That treatment would tend to shorten life. It would unquestionably shorten life. The flogging would produce exhaus. tson and low fever, and death from the shock to the constitution. The wounds would slough and produce fever. I should ex ect to find the man sink under it within theperod named. 'The symptoms described are those of a man sinkimg under low fever. It is impossible that a man could have lived under it. There would of necessity be an offensive smell coming from him. The treatment would produce diarrhces.
Cross-examined.-I don't speak with confidence upon things I don't see ; it depends upon the case and the circumstances I hear. Any violence might tend to shorten life, and would depend upon the state of the body of the man receiving the injury. Every wound produces acertain amount of fever. Ineverycase of flogi ng theremiust be fever, in proportion to the amount of the punishment. I never saw a military flo g, I am hapy to say., I speak also of concussions and fa A blow with that block and
kicks oin the chest would shorten life; It would depend aon the violence with which the injury was inflicted. Thi block swung with a powerful hand would produce instant death.
Re-examined.-Judging from the evidence, I think the floggings would have reduced the man so much that very Httle was required to cause instant death. The man not being stunned by the blow, I thinlk the floggings were sufficient to cause the death.
Bearing in mind the evidence given as to the man's demeanour after the blow, can you give an opinion as to what was the cause of the death ?-I cannot discriminate.
Mr. Andrews.-I am surgeon to the 1st Dzoon Guard. I have heard the evidence. Assuming it to be true, the man could not have survived those injuries without medical assistance. I should not expect a strong healtby trooper to survive such treatment; he mieht eventually die from it. The frequent floggings affectedthe whole system. I have heard the evidence as to the blow with the block and the floggings, but not having seen the case I can form no opinion. I am led to believe that he would have died under the floggings, without the blow.
Cross-examined.-I can't discriminato between the two; but the floggings were quite sufficient to canse death. A violent diarrho3a might cause death without medical assistance in those latitudes. Effects of injuries must dependon the state of the body. Any wonnd is dangerous.
Re-examined.-There was nothing in the evidenec to show the man had diarrhea.
Mr. COLERIDGE made a most eloquent address to the jury on behalf of the prisoner, urgmg upon them that the prisoner was not responsible for the acts of the mate. He also pointed out discrepancies in the evidence of the witnesses, but he more particularly called upon them to discredit their evidence altogether, for it was impossible that if they had told the story they had detailed to-day to the Consul abroad that officer would have refused to take cognizance of the offence; and yet they far dola.ed that they had made their complaint, andasked
for justhce 1t vras clear that they never could have told a single word of this pretended transaction to the Consul, or he would have sent the prisoner home in custody, instead of his being allowed to return in command of the ship. If, then, they had not told the story at Rio Grande, these mnen had deliberatelY comne by pe-rjured evidence to take away this man's iffe. Whiat a fearful story it was they told that these two fiends should fly upon that unhappy blaock, the fated ship floating on the waters with its horrile cargo of sighs and groans, and yet these other men standing by, a-nd day by day allown these fearful acts to go on with. out a murmur. If they ha told thia sto -to the Consul in the presenice of the prisoner, dlid the jury Yinwk ta h p tain -would have been such a, fool as toallowta the ciap-n weapns heyrefrredto o rmai inthe ship for three monhs urig al te vyag hoe?Would he not in an istat hve hron tem veroar? Therefore ho. contnde tha th stry tey oldto-day was substantally ntru, or hey are amosta,ha as the mnen

witwhica theynIa4 .to deal, &nd therefore they were wit to convict theeprisonser because e did not utherfere to pre'vent the mate acting with suchi crnelt~y. Many a mran was weak enough to sand by afD ee an iury committed who lad not the courage to comimit the act himself; but that person could Rot be convicted of that offence. The jury, thereforer could not conviet -the prisoner when it was clear tbht if anypart of the story wan true the catewasthe real delinquernt.
Mr. Justic Wmna.'s, in tlmming up the case,t t aid the *uyhad a maost sacred and important duty to perform.
Thyhad beeni sworn to do justice, acting on the evidence, - and on theoevidonce only, between the cause of publif juticed and the prisoner at the bar; and as, on the one han dthea must not be deterred by any consequences resulting from their verdict from finding the prisoner guilty if they thought the evidence brought home to him the fearful crime; with which he stod charged, so,on. the other hand,they must not be led away by any feelings of resentment or indignation
for any acts of cruelt proved against the prisoner to.- find a verdict against hi, unlees they.-thought he was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the charge brought against him by the inOictment ; that cbarge was the crime of murder,an it was defined by the law to be a kilig another with malice aforethought; but it was ia duty to explain to them that the extmforetought" was t iot to be understoocdl ite ordinar sense as it
was used in common onuversation-it meant that. the. fact of taking away life had been, attended with such eircumstances as were the ordinary symptoms of a wicked, depraved, and malignant spirit. If a man used a deadly weapon they would infer that he meant to kill, ad that he was so deadly bent on mishoief that his condcuct amounted to malice aforethoughtr; on the oner hand, if a man used his fists, or a stik, or any other instrument' of
tOat sort not calculated to domnuch bodily harm,they ould,. generally speaking, infer that he did not miean to kill the pierson upon whom he inflicted the blows or to 'do him grievous harm, and, although he took away lie, they would not in' such a case infer that he wa soatuated by any malice, and therefore the offence would bemanslaughter, and not murder. :Nbw,
in the present case, so far as they could learn, the atins-. mnents of violence used were not instruments in themselves - dangerous, bing such things as a cat, or rope, or brush, hut
the case premd gainst the prisoner in this way, that upon.- the evidence thes instruments were used so often and so.- os uelly that the jury might come to the conclusion that they could not butt infer thLat such a depraved and malignant
spirit existed in him as would satisfy the imputation of.- malice. If they believed the evidence to the faul ex-
tenit, that it was substantially true, it was very difficult, to suggest to them any escape from coinizg to such aLn inference and drawing the conclusion that the offence, if any offence at all, was te offence of murder, and the only view. of the case whic'h could justify a verdict of manslaughter was this-if they should think the evidence of the conduct of the prisner hadl been exaggerated to such an extent that, altou-gh the death was attributable to the unlawful
violence1 of the prisoner, yet that this violence was given. under such circumstances that they could not infer that he nieantto doanygrevusharm tothe deceased; thattheoffence was unlawful admttedl of no doubt, because sithough it was
true, as laid down by the counsel that the master of a 3ner-' chant vessel had authorit over all persons in the ship, and: maight admainister reasonab(le correction, yet his authorsty in. that respewt was that of a, parent over a chid. Ho must take care that there was sufficient cause for chastisement, anid that the chbastisement was reasonable, or he would be cr.iminly rsosbe hr i o
a1ppert i ob any evidence of any occa-' amen for such chastisement, stil less for suclh immoderate chastisement as had been detailed. There was another point of kaw which had been raised upon the evidence, and upon which it was necessary he should offer
them some explanation. If they thought there was good' reason for coming to the conclusion that the death of the deceased was attributable to the act of the mate in striking the deceased with a block, or kicking him, or any other violence which he infflcted without the participation of the prisoner in that violence then ho thought the prisoner would not be responsible for his death ; and he muast be acquLitted, unless they thought he participate in
the act and encouraged it; because, unless he participated.- in it, the master of a vessel was not criminally responsible. for the acts of his mzate. If they thought there was good ground for concluding thAt the death was attributable en-
tirely to the violence of the mate, in which the prisoner did. not participate, they must asequit him ; but if teprvos violence and il-treatment were such that the deese a reduced to a state of debility, and by reason of that he fell a victim to the blow or violence of the mate, whereas he would not have been killed by it if he had not been reduced to such a condition by the -violence of the prisoner, then he was of opinion that the prisoner was responsible for the death of the deceased, which would not have happened but for the previous misconduct of the prisoner. The leaned Judge then read through the whole of the evidence.
The jury returned a verdict of (uiliy of 7manslaughter, and he was sentenced to be transported for life.

This action was brought to recover from the defendants, as the executors of a deceased person, named Hayton, the sum of 40 Z, as the cost of the funeral of that person. The defendants paiinto court 22de.c and denied their liability beyond that amount.
Mrz. Serjeant Parry and Mr. Chitty conlucted the plaintiff's case; a-nd Mr. E. James, Q.C., and Mfr. Johnson appeared for the defendants.
The plaintiff in this action, it appeared, was an und er. taker in London, and it seemed that the deaessed, 1ayton, was formerly7 a person in an hurabl

sureon who attended the deceased in sl ilnnd he was named one of the executors of hisil,nd enaed the plaintiff to conduct the funera through
talityhof aperson natmed Margette, who was known tonthe deceased. The funeral appeared to have been performed in
the most extraordinary, if not extravagant manner, the deceased having, it ap ged, been placed in a brassbound coffn, and t there was a soi t of "lyisg in state" prepared, after he was screwed down; and for the expeuses connected with this ceremony, amooh which was a charge for a new suit po cuthes,o tbac
silk scarf, and hatband and gloves for a person to " show up" the company who came to see the "1lyin- in state,"1 a very considerable sum was charged in the bii.l Another item was 1691. for "1reniembrancee' in the shape of scarfs and gloves, and "1elegantly embossd cards," which were sent to 66 persons. Witnesses were called on behalf of the plaintiff, who stated that all the articles were realy furnished, and that the changes were only the usual ones made in such cases, and a that what 'w done was by the authority of tho defendants.
Mr. JTAMxrs, in his address to the jury on behalf of the. defendlants, said that the grounds upon whic'h they in theoir position of, executors felt it their duOty too sothe clam shae by the plaintiff -were that the fumera=! been conducted in an absurdly extravagant manner, and 'was totally unsultedtothepositionofthe deceasse' who,althoughhohad, mAuch to his credit, succeded in amassing a conasiderable sum of money, 'was in reality in no better condition of life than a labourer, and that they had given no authority for such lavish and unnecessary expenditure.

This action was brought by a farmer living near Wolverhampton, to recover the value of certain goods seized by thedefendants under these circn,nstances The plaintiff's sOn, Richard, was a clerk to Mr. Walker, a solicitor at Wolver-
hampton, and was committed to custody in June last upon, a charge of forgery, whereby he had defrauded his employerto a large amaount.

The defendants, with this warrant, weant tothe plaintiff's house and carried from two rooms a waggon-load of furniture, which they alleged had been bought by the son and paid for with the produce of his forgery. The question now was whether the goods really belonged to the father or to the son, and upon this point there was contradictory evidence.

Mr. Serjeant Thomas and. Mr. Carrington appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Berjeant Pigott and Mr. Scotland for the efendant.
This was an- action brought by Edward Whalley, the executor of his brother, William Whajley, against the defendant Wilder, an auctioneer at Stafford, to recover 241. 8&, the amount of goods which the defendant had sold on credit. The defendant pleaded that he had done so by the consent of the plaintiff.
It appeared from the evidence of the plaintiff that in the month of Ma, 1852, he had employed the defendant to sell goods which had belonged to his deceased brother, and that the defendant sold them by auotion on the 25th and 26th of May, 1852, and rendered an account of the sale, vith a check for the proceeds, less the expense, withtheexception of the following item :-" To balance by goods bought by -Mr. Thomas Whalley,asagentforhis nother, 241. 8s." t was stated by the plaintiff that he hadnever given sny assent to these goods being sold on credit to aDy person whnatever; but, on his cross-examination, he said tat, in the year 1852, he had brought an action of detinne aginst his brother, Thomas Whalley, for detaining these goods.
On the part of the defendaut it was stated by Thomas Whalley that, at the auction, he had, with the consent of hig brother, the plaintiff, bought in these goods, at the desire of their mother, to prevent their being solid under their value, and that the plaintiff might have had them afterwards if he had chosen.
Mr. Justice CRtowDER, in summing up, said, it was the
of in auctionaer to sell goods and pay over theproeeoto his employer less the expensec, and not to sell on credit to any one unless by the assent of his employer. If the jury were salisfied in this case that the ptintiff had either bejore or fit the time of the sale given such assent, or after the Wale had ratified sach an arrangement, they ought to find for the defendant, and if they were not so satisfied, they ought to find for the plaintiff.
The jury found their verdict for the defendant.

James Cope, the assessor and collector of the land and property taxes at Darlaston, was charged with obtainiag vrious sums of money from divers persons by false pretences. The indictment contained as many as 21 counts, 13 of which related to the land-tax, and the other eight to the pr rty-tcx.
hlr Iuddleston, Mr. M cnamara, and Mr. Motteram ap. peared for the prosecution; Mr. Keating, QC., and. Mr. pcotlund defended the prisoner.
Mr. IIUDDl.STON, in opening the case, said, the prisoner had been for two or three years the assessor and collector of the land and property taxes at Darlaston. The charge now made agaist hin was that he had in numerous instanoes compelled parties to pay land tax who were not liable; and, with reepect to the property-tax, he had surcharged various parties beyond the sanm at which they were assessed. The frauds eommitted by the defendant had, as might have been expected, created a great deal nf dissatisfction, and the defendant thought fit to leave the country; but he had sinoe returned, and now surrendered himself to mneet the charge. He had written the following letter, which, though it must excite some sympathv in his favour, nevertheless seemed to contain an admission of his guilt:-

-Your affe*ionate Nephew." At the close of the learned counsel's opening,
Mr. KEATIZG said, he'wished to take his Lordshlp's opinion whether upon the facts stated thix indictment could be maintained. The 19th section of the Land-Tax Act of the 38th of George IIL, chap. 5, enacted, "^That if any assessor or collector, or other person or persons, shalU wilfuly neglect or refuse to perform his or their duty in the due and speedy execution of this Act, or shall be guilty of any fraud or abuse in executing the same," the commissioners should have power to impose on such person a fine not exceeding 401A; and by the 4Bth section it was provided that no assessor or coUector shall be liable "for or by reason of such executon" to anypenslty other than such as by the Act might be a 43d George LI., chap. 99, secs. 19, 51, contained dimilar provisions with respect to the property-tax colectors.
Mfr. Justice WinLrEs said, he.thought the present indictmiat was not instituted for anything done by the prisoner "in the execution of the Act," to which cases only the sections cited referred - but this was an indictment for acts alleged to be done by tne prisoner extortionately, in abuse of andanot in thelexecution of the Act. HisLordshiptherefore overruled the objection.
Several -witnesses were then caUed to prove that the prisoner had charged them with smaU sums for land-tax, and that their names did not appear in the land-tax assessment. Several witnesses also stated that they had been made to pay in respect of property tax larger snms than they were assessed,at in the assessment-book. It appeared that the prosecution was institnted by a committee of persons who considered theraselves to he improperly assessed, and not by the Government or the Commissioners.
lIr. KxATUG, in an elaborate address to the jury for the defendant, contended that it was shown in each case that the property wa assessible to the land-tax, though the names of the present owners did not appear in the assessment-book; and, with respect to the three overcharges to the property-tax, he contended there was nothing to show that the prisoner had done more than commit an inaccuracy. The learned counsel made some strongplobservations on the production of the defendant's letter written to his uncle, and contended that it was quite consistent with the pri soner's innocence of the present charge.
Mr. Best and Mr. Williams, county magistrates, and other respectable witnesses, gave the prisoner an excellent character.
llr. Justice WiLus, in summing up, said, that there was considerable doubt as to the land-tax cases. and he thought the chief question for the jury.would be whether in two of the property-tax cases the prisoner had wilfully made the overcharges, or whether they arose, as suggested, from mistake. His Lordship, in allusion to the defendant's letter, saidhe certanlydidnotike to see a kid seethed in its mother'smilk, andhe thought the letter in question was suffclent to have touched a heart of stone; but, whatever the jury might think of the uncle who had given up that letter, theymust say what weight they rwould give to it in connexion withi the other evidence.-

Mr.AItA said that, with his Lordship's sanction, he a-ould offer no evidence in sutpport of the other indict-
Mr. Justice WnazS said, the learned counsel must take his own course.
The prisoner was then Acquiuedon the other indictments, no evidece being offered, and he wFas discharged.
Mr., Justice Willes made a great effort, by sitting till a late hour, to conclude the business of these assises on this the last day; lnt though his Lordship did not leave the court till 10 minutes to 12 o'clock at night he found it ne. ceIrary to adjourn the Court till Monday morning.

John Percival, aged 22, farm servant was indicted for the manslaughter of Robert Mitchell, on the 22d of December,
185,.at Alfreton.
Mr. Morewood prosecuted; Mr. Bristowe defended the prisoner.
This case affords a lamentable instance of the danger bf practicaljokes. The deceased, a lad of 15, was in the habit of going to a farmer's for milk by a path which had got apparently the repute of being haunted * and on the aftesnoon in question, Monday )eoember 2, he went to Mr. Day's farm as usuaL. Whie there some conversation took place about mysterious knockings which had been hear4 and this led to a plot between the prLsoner and another 1ad to play a trick upon the deceased. The trick was this-the pnsoner coverdX himself with a white cloth and took his station by a stile on the footpath by which the deceased would return home, and the other lad accompamied the deceased on his way. When they got within xight of the stile and the white figure the other bo exclaimed, "What'sthat?' to which the deceased Answ M, "Nothing." But ashe approached nearer he called out to the figure " is that you, Jack ?" to which no answer was gien. The other boy then hid himself behind a tree, buvt the deceaed dsill advanced, and asked again the same question. Again no answer was given, but only a moan. The deceased, nevertheless, camae up the to figure and then discovered the prisoner. At that time he did not appear to have exhibited any symptoms of jt fear; but when he got home la ther described him as looking very pale and frightened; and when he was ased hatwas the matter he said that he had bee
frightened by seeing a wlite figure at the stile. Later that eveninghe apperd however, to have recovered, for he Lte his supper ana was 10km and playing 'with a young girt who wi m the house where a and his father lodged. fhe followng morning he was worse. He oould not retain food onhis stomach, and he became so unwell that it was necessary to call in medical aid. The doctors who saw him found him suffering from great depresson of the nervous system, andahe ultimately died in a state of great exhaustion on the Friday following. One of the doctors thought that the boy's system had beenweakened by overvwork, which would render any shock to the nervous systemnmore serious; but neither of them was able to exress any clear opinion that the death wvas the result of the fright.
Mr. BRASrOWI ohjected that the act which the prisoner had done was not unla wful, so as to render him guilty of m-aslaughter even if the death of the boy could be attributed to the frgh thereby occasioned.
The learned .JUDGE sid thatbhe&thought the case would fall within the definition of manslaughter, butt as the caso was a novel one, he would reserve the question if it became. necessary.
Mr. BiTRSTOWB then addressd the jury forthe,prisoner, contending that the evidence did not satisfactorily establish that the death had been occasioned by the fright.
The learned JUDGE summed up, and the Jury found the prisoner Not Guilty.
He was then discharged, having been In p risen since December, and being warned- by the learned Judge never again to indulge in practical jokes.

Mr. SARGOOD objected to the reception of Mr. Mathows's affidavit, upon the ground that it contained personal reflections upon Mr. Allcroft, which were not justified by the occasion nor by the facts.
After some discussion upon this point,

During the examination the wretched woman appeared much affected, shed tears, and buried her face in her nands.
William Aldridge, labourerSnthe Regent's Park, proved that on Tuesday morning, about half-past 6, he was orossin York-bridge, and his attention was attracted to an old shawvl nd a child's hood on the grass near the arch of the bridge. A park-keeper came up, and on showing him the clothes he procred the drags, and in about 20 minutes they plld,up~ the body of the deceased child. It was chandkerchbiefwas tied tightly round the chiled' neck a h ad ee strangled. The boy was removed to Marylebone Workchouse.
Mr Mushett, the house surgeon, proved having made a post mortem examination of the body. Death might have been caused by the ligature round the neck-, but it did not take place by drowning.
Benjamin Morris said he-binelieved the prisoner to be the wife of his wife's brother, and that his name was William Cratwley Be had identified the child taken from the
Mr. Tubbs, relieving officer of Marylebone, said he was present on the previous afternoon when the child wag identified by the list witness, and from information he then gle aned he took a constable with him to St. Pancras WorkMonse, where he found the prisoner in bed, she having attempted to commit suicide, and been conveyed there under direction of one of the medical officers of St. Pancras Mr. Wildoore). He asked her name, and she said it was Crawley. She afterwards said that was the name she went by, but that her real name was Price. Crawley had died in MaIrylebono Workhouse three or four years ago. He then asked her what famuily she bad and she replied, "A boy about seven years old, rho is liing with my sisterY He then cautioned her not to say anytlin more, as he might have to repeat it at the police-court; bUt she then added, bursting into tears and becoming very excited, "I had a baby, but I made away with it; do you know where it is now." He replied, " Yes, it is In the Marylebone Workhouse." Her exciterent increased, and she asked wherb it was found, and on his telling her she exclaimed, " I threwit over the bridge on Monday night between 8 and 9 o'clqclk
I was climbing up to throw myself over as well, when a. policeman saw me and hallooed, and I was then frightened and ran away." He asked her if the shawl (part of one she had On) was her's, and she replied, "Yes; and the other half of it was what the baby was wrapped up in. Since I made away with my child my blood has turned to cold water, aud I feel it about my loins now. The reason for my destroying it was, that It had been such a great sufferer fom disacsed kidneys, and has been under the care of Dr. Wildbore " He took her in a cab to the Marylebone police-station, and she was then charged with the murder of her child, who she said laad never been christened, but that it was registered in the name of Robert Crawley Price. The police-nspector who took the charge stated that when he read the charge over to the prisoner, although cautioned, he said, " I took its life because it had suffered so much, and I have suffered a great deal myself. I shou'dl have thrown myself into the water with my child if a policeman had not come in sight and called to me. I then ran away." She was then looted up and watched by twro constables

magnisrte) and asked if she had anything to say, repgied in the negative, and wras then committed to Newgat to talk her trial on the charge.e£ wilful murder.
WxSTNaNsni-Henry Richards, a cab-driver, was sum-- sanond by Mr. W. Snell, of 3, Belgrave-road, for maisbehaviour towards him.
Complainant, an elderly gentleman, stated that on the 6th ins. he was crossing from Pont-street to Belgrave-square, when he was suddenly struck on the chest by one of the sbafts of defendant's cab. He caUedCto him to paU up and he stopped, when in doing so, the shaft also struck complainanton the aide of the face. He then asked defendant why he was not more careful; he said "I am not to take care of you," and upon being reasoned with upon his recklessness he moved awray slowly, repeating the same observation.
John Stokes p roved that after the complainant had been struck the defendant behaved very improperly and offensivrely by telling him that he waxs quito old enough to take care of himself, and ought not to want anybody to take care of
Defendant said he was driving very slowly, when the gentleman crossed the road towards Cadogan-place. Re called to him, but not very loudly, twice, and in pulling up the shaft touched the gentleman's hat.
Mr. PAYNTR observed that elderly gentlemen were very often deaf, and it did not follow, if they did not hear and jump out of the way with the alacrity of youn ones, that they were to be run down. The least the defendant could have done after rdnning against the gentleman was to express his regret instead of making the unbecoming remarks wvhich had been proved.
Mr. Snellsaid he wasnotseriouslyhurt, and merely confined to his room for two or three days; and but for defendant's offensive behaviour afterwards he might have overlooked the matter.
Mr. PAyN-R= observed that it behoved all persons to drive very slowvly ait crossings, and aittill foot passengers had assd. To ldies frendsof is,had lost their lives through the inattention and carelessness of drives s as they were on wide crossings.
Defendant wfas fined 20s and costa, or in defasIt to be committed for 14 days.
Thomas Brown was finally examined, charged with a robbery at Mr. Jubb's, the Star and Crown, Broadway, Westmininter.
He made no defence, and was fully committed for trial.
CLzRsENwmL.-Thomas Millett, a dirty-looking fellow, residing at 28, Brewer-street, St. Pancras, was charged by Mary Millett, his wife, a sickly-looking woman, and Sarah Smith, his mother-in-law, with having brutaUy assaulted them, and threatened to murder them.
Mr. TyRwar asked the prisoner what he had to say to the charge.
Prisoner.-It is all the effect of drink, I am very so
Mr. TYlwmrrrv said, such conduct towards women could inot be tolerated. It was disgraceful, and if magistrates. ,were not to interfere to check violence of this description it wouldleadtoremark orcensre. The pooriwomenhadnotonly heen ill used, but their lives threatened by bim, and if something was not done to protect theratheresult would probably be murder. He felt it to be his duty to order him to find two responsible housekeepers to keep the peace towards his wife and mother-in-law, and all Her Majesty's subjects, for sixmonths, andit behovedhim tobe cautious how hb behaved himself in future, for if he was brought before him again under simihar circumstances ho would most assuredly send him to prison for the full term of six months.
le was conveyed to prison in default of bail.

PARIS, MRcsH 26, 6 P I Much of what has been lately said in the Belgian 'papers on the Neuchhtel question is, I am assured, lerroneous. Affairs are not in the advanced state 'theylhave been described. x de Hatzfeldt has, it is true, recently received despatches, but, contrary to what was hoped and believed, they do not contain his final instructions; theso final instructions he had not received up to last night, and I doubt whether they have reached him even to-day. What we know, however, for certain is, that the greatest possible dissension prevails in the Prussian Cabinet.
The Ministers are divided among themselves; some incline to a compromise, others hold out against any act which would be the renunciation of the King's aovereignty in the Principality. The King, -who is at all times slow to make up his mind, is bewildered by these distracted counsels. The army is of course against any sacriifice; the Kreuz Zeitung party also resists; and the Prince of Prussia has thrown the weight of his influence into the scale. If the King show a disposition to accede, he is reminded of the solemn engagement of 1850 to the 65 Royalist deputies of Neuchitel, when he lifted his arm and declared that he would never abandon them. The same pledge was taken by the Prince of Prussia in his own name and that of his children. Nevertheless, it is believed that an arrangement wil be effected. The conditions demanded will hardly be accepted by the Swiss. They will present lconditions of their own which will be equaUy distasteful to Prussia. Each party may, however, lower their demands, and, under the influence of the French and English Governments, a middle termwillbe found. At thermoment I write matters have not reached the point of fixing a day for the Conferences, but they will meet with as little delay as possible after M. do Eatzfeldt receives his instructions. It is but fair to say that Count Walewski is doing his utmost to bring matters to an amicable and honourable conclusion.
A private letter from Jassy gives some account of the expense which the Austrian occupation has occasioned the finances of Moldavia, either the Principality itself or the municipalities. It comprises only the time between the 4th of September, 1854, and the 1st of November, 1856 -

7,294,691 In the foregoing are not included the wood taken gratuitously in the forests belonging to the clergy, the salaries of the special employes for the army of occupation, the expense of lodging the military in private houses, or billets (which are gratuitous), as also fuel, light, beds, and clean linen, from the superior officers to tbe lowest ranks of the army, all which have been at the expense of the inhabitants. The rate for a General officer is 500 Austrian ducats yearly (the ducat is equivalent to 11f. 75c.) ; for a colonel or a major, 300 ducats; for a captain or a subaltern, from 100 to 200 ducats; and for a private soldier, 20 ducatz, at the lowest. As to Wallachia, one may have an idea of what the Austrian occupation cost it 'when it is known that the Treasury is encumbered with a debt of 22,000,000 piastres, which the last Administration left as its legacy to future Administrations.
A private letter from Cadiz mentions that, ac,cording to the latest advices from the Gulf of 3Mexico, the forts of Vera Cruz had fired on the boats of the Spanish frigate Ferrolana, though 'war was not yet declared. The conmander of the frigate demanded an explanation of this act of hostilty. It is added, that the commandant on the American station had anchored in the roads, and that there were several ships of the French and English squadron in those waters. The Mexicans boast that in case of 'war they can count on assistance from the United States.

THE SOUTND DUES.
(FROM OUR OWN conRsroDMr.)
BERLIN, MARCH 19.
The draught of the projected treaty for the redemtion of the Sound Dues, which appeared some little time back in your columns, underwent some modifications before it arrived at its final conclusion and. execution last Saturday, the 14th inst. This draught was the result of the negotiations that had been earriedonfor some time previouslybetween England, Prussia, and France, and to which Denmark had more or less assented; Austria, Hanover, and I believe the Hauseatic Towns, signified their accession to it as soon as it was made known to them, but subsequently various alterations have been made in it, in the course of the last few weeks, as will be evident from the following apeer of the actual treaty, which was signed on the 14th inst.
The treaty is concluded between Denmark on the one part, and Belgium, France, Great Britain, Hanover, the Hanseatic Towns, MecklenburgSchwerin, the Netherlands, Austria, Oldenburg, Prussia, Russia, and Sweden and Norway on the other part. Denmark undertakes on her part, in Art. 1, no longer to levy any impost under the name of Soimd or Belt Dues, Light Dues, &c., on any vessel, or its cargo, passing the Sound or the Belts, whether' the, vessels only pass through, or whether they put into Danish ports; and also not to cause any vessel passing through the Sound or Belts to be in any way detained or searched. The aforesaid dues shall not be reimposed at any future time in the form or under the name of navigation dues or tolls. In Art. II. she undertakes :-1. To keep up and maintain all the lights and beacons at present existing in the Danish waters and on the Danish coasts in good order, to devote care and attention to the increase and improvement of the same, without cost or charge to foreign navigation; to watch over the pilotage in the Cattegat, Sound, and Belts; to fix the rates of pilotage only with reference to the interests of navigation; and to permit private speculators, foreigners as well as Danes, to form establishments for towing in the Sound and Belts. 2. To come to an understanding with Sweden for the further maintenance of the existing lights and beacons on the Swedish and Norwegian coasts which at present eontribute to the safety of the passage through the Sound and the Cattegat. In Art. III. she undertakes, on all canals and lines of communication between the German Ocean, the Elbe, and the Baltic, to reduce the existing transit dues on all goods to 16 skillings Danish for 500 lb. Danish, and to introduce generally such exemptions from these transit dues as already exist on some of these individual lines of communication. Any advantage that may subsequently be conferred on any single line of communication shall be at the same time extended to all other canals and lines of communication.
On the other part, each and every one of the States participating in this treaty undertakes, in Articles IV., V., and VI., to pay, as an indemnity to Denmark, the sum specified against its name in Article IV. Each State is at liberty to pay off its quota within 20 years, in equal half-yearly instalments, which shall comprise the proportional amount of the capital and the interest on the arrears. Each State has separately to come to an agreement with Denmark as to the manner and the place where and the rate of exchange at which the payment is to be made, and as to the conditions for the entire or partial discharge of its quota.
According to Article VI., Denmark's obligations come into force on the 1st of April of this year. By that time the exchange of the ratifications of the treaty shall, if possible, have already taken place in Copenhagen. Those States whose constitutional polity renders it imperative undertake to procure the necessary approval of their legislative bodies.
Finally, Denmark has reserved to herself the right of coming to separate arrangements with such States as have not taken part in this treaty with regard to the fiscal treatment of their vessels, with this reservation, however, that the vessels shall neither be detained nor searched.
The United States of North America were not represented at the late Sound Dues Conferences in Copenhagen, the American Government having refused somne time back any longer to acknowledge the principle on which Sound Dues are collected at all; hopeful expectations are, however, entertained in Copenhagen that, now that an arrangement has been arrived at with the European Powers, that Gcvernment wiU be found less unwiling to enter into this generally received plan for the redemption of them. Despatches were sent off from Copenhagen to WVashington on this subject sufficiently early in February for them to arrive there before the closing of Congress on the 4th inst., so that it is not improbable that some answer satisfactory to Denmark may arrive in the Danish capital before the conclusion of the term appointed by the American Govemrnent for the determination of its treaty with Denmark.
Last Sunday Mr. Buclhanan, o" MTiniLser in Copenhagen, passed throughlIambu., his way to ndon, whither he is, doubtless, the be4rer of a copy of the general treaty just concluded with Denmark, and also of a draught for a special treaty to be concluded between that Power and England with reference to the mode which England will choose for the payment of her quota; he is accompanied to England by his second attac1U, Mr.Donald Cameron.

TH7E Cl OF TAINTOnv
It had been expected that the vrit might teach tbe city early enough on Saturday for proclamation to be made that dSy, so that after three clear daya' ntotice, including Sunday, the nomination might h%ve taken place on Thursday and the poll on Friday next. As coon as the Council held at Buckinghamn Palace on Saturday was ¢onduded a messenger was despAtched to the city with the writ, but, unfortunately, be dia not arrive until past 4 o'clock. The law of elections re. quires that proclamation of the writ should be made before 4 o'clock, and the writ was thus too late in arriving for the ceremony to take place on Saturday. Proclamation will therefore be made to-day; but, allowing the three clear days required by law, the nomination cannot now take place before Friday and the polling before Saturdayattheearliest. As Saturday is strictly observed as the Sabbath by the many Jewish electors for the city, it ig not impossible that the election may be delayed until the beginning of next week.
MIDDLESE.
It was reported on Saturday that Lord Chelsea, who has retired from the representation of Dover, would come for. ward for Middlesex upon Conservative principles. We believe, however, that Mr. Hanbury will be the colleague of Iord Robert Grosvenor.
BERBSEME.-Addresses have just been issued by Mr. Robert Palner and Mr. G. H. Vansittart, offering themselves for re-election, but Lord Barrington declines to see k a renewal of the sffrages of the consituency. Mr. Vansittait, finding that his pairing off against Government on the Chinese question has given dissatisfaction to a large number of electors, has entered into sn explanation of his conduct. He says:-
"Summoned Abroad ahortly before the opening of the seilon. I tooknopartin lts poiUtical struggles; if pre'ent, both on Dancia questions and on the war with China I should have cordlly supported Her Majety's Government; for, whatever doubts may attach to some Points of the dispute, whatever errors of judgment msy por
sibly have been oommitted, yet, taking a tair view of tbe whole quer tion, nd bearing in mind the unanimous opinion of al penonall, ac. qusinted with that county, I both approve and admire the conduct ofLordPalmten iolnsochivalrously upbholdng the honour and interests of England and the credit of pubic servants abrad."
The Hon. Philip Bouverie has issued his address to the electors. The hon. candidate expresses his views upon a variety of topics, and states that he would give his support to any measure which might afford the prospect of a settle. ment of the difficult and irritating questions connected with the levying of church-rates. He would also be willing to give his consent to a well-devised scheme for the extension of the franchise. Mr. Bouverie attended the market at Reading on Saturday, and met with a most cordial recep. tion from a large body of electors.
BRMiNGHA3L-There have been rumous of an opposition to the return of Mr. Muntz, but none is likely to occur. A public meeting of the electors is to be hell on Wednesday night, at which it is proposed to canvass the Parliamentary conduct of both Mz. MIuntz and MSr. Scholefield during the last and previous sessions; hut no serious opposition is contemplated, and if attemlpted it wrould be unsuccessful. The votes they gave against Mr. Cobden's motion have grtievously offended the " Peace party," but obtained thena many supporters.
CRESHREB (NORtsn).-Mr. W. Tatton Egerton writes from Rlome, where he has gone for the recovery of his health, and Mr. Cornwall Legh writes from London, to the electors of North Cheshire, offerimg themselves for re-election. There is no probability of an opposition.
COLCEMSTEB.-There is but little doubtthat Mr. Minlerand Mr.Gurdon Rebow will be returned forthis borough without opposition, Captain Paget R.A., the second candidate in tke Conservative interest, maving intimated his intention of retiring from the contest.
DUDLIY.-The opponents of Mr. Saudars have failed in obtaining a candidate, and he i likely to be returned without further opposition. Alderman Baldwin and Mr. Charles Shaw, merchant, of Birmuingham, were solicited to come forward, but declined the honour. Mr. Sandars states that he shall be an independent supporter of Govern. ment, and had he been in Parliament should have voted against Mr. Cobden's motion.
GATSHEAD.-Mr. William Hutt will be returned for this borough unopposed.
HEETFORDSI1BE.-In this county a compromisehad been agreed upon by the Whig and Tory election committees, the latter consenting to withdraw one of the late members in favour of the Whig candidate, on condition that the other two seats should be left undisputed in their hands. A misunderstanding which threatens to interfere with the compromise has, however, arisen-Sir H. Meux, the Conservative candidate, whom it was proposed to withdraw, having refused tosanction the arrangement, It appears that the resolution to concede one seat to the Whig interest was agreed upon at a meeting of the Conservative Registration Association, held on the 12th of March, at which Sir HL MIoux, Sir E. B. Lytton, and Mr. Abel Smith, jun., the members for the county, were present. It was left to a committee to decide which of the three should retire, in the event of the Whig committee acceding to the compromise, the meeting pledging itself to abide by the decision of the committee, whatever that might be. The terms of the compromise having been agreed to by the two committees, it was intimated to the parties concernea that the gentleman selected for with. drawal was Sir H. Meux, on account of the state of his health. That gentleman has, however, issued an address to the electors aunouncing himself as a candidate-a circumstance which has called forth the disapproval of the Conservative committee,who urge that the resolutions " honourably entered into shall be as honourably carried out." Sir H. Meux, in a second address to the electors, states that the time has not yet arrived for a full explanation of all the circumstances, but that such explanation will, he is assured, convince them that he has done nothing deserving a forfeiture of their esteem and confidence. Sir B, B. Lytton, in his address to the electors, says:-
' As to ' secrt coaltions or ' preconcerted combinations,' after the Eolemn donial of Lord Derby, and of the representative of each sectiO in the lleged * coalitions or' Combiuations,' no man can credit that cry unles he be prepared to erase from the English language tho name *gentleman' and the word honour.' That politicians of various parties wi meet in the ame lobby 'spon que3tions involving principles of humanity and justice, or the right interpretation of inter. national laws, Is an event which, whether convenient or not to the Mnisters of tho day, must continue to occur as long ru England has a frce P4rlamnent. I Approve the conduct of the Government in sending to Cbina, simultaneously with a force mslllrent to protect our countrymen and attest our strength, a pleni. potentlaty intrusted with powers to negot'ate for the termtnation of hortilities and improved relations of commerce. It this be the consequence of our vote the vote is amply vindicated; if tbh Government had prodeterined on it they should have stated so to the House, and there would bave been no majority against them. With regard to our domestic policy, I do not think that the country requlres the restless legls'atiot of incesalnt change; but ;whether in legal, administrtive, or n tnancl measures, which deserve the character of judicious amelioratIons, and are not merely experimental ha-ards, I cannot beHeve that Conservatives are tlb lems eniEghtened, the less the men of their century, because they will resolutely guard these organic institutions of Church and State by which the national character ha been formcd. The diffudon of healthfaulnowledge to the widest circle of our countrymen Is, and ever bha been, among my most cherihbed sim. But the more I see the pracical difficulties in the way of general assent to a nuiform ystem of national education, the more I am compelied to come to tbebelief tbat the best methexi of attaining Popular oeducationial advancement wll be by expending the mabcinery already at our DiipoiaL. The longvexed question of church-rates I sincerely desire to sea pennanently cet at rest in a conciliatory sDirit by a responsIbe ;Government, provided only, bht provided always, that the sot.:ameat be such as moderate and onlightened Churchmen can assent to without the strrender of any uiudamcental principle UDoU which thj constitution of a church Istablishment is based."
H'ILL.-Lord Ashley, who it wvas at first believed would be supported only by tho ultra-Prote3tant X}arty, hit ano ceeded in obtaining the support of ine of a- opinions. He profeases himself a,w arin Adheren' of Lc*rd Palrseref6n, and h n equally weol received by I.' ra!s aind - 'servatIves, Churchmen and Dissenters,. Ili- 'o. f success are very flattering, and it is not improoat: at e -ay be returned at the head of the poll.
IPSaVICH.-The address of Mr. .. C. Cobu-.d, the present Conservative member, who off.- lmrsel for re-election, was issued on Friday. The hon. g utleman expresses his continned adherence to Conservative princip esx nd with reference to the hostilitiesin China says:
'I regret that the coutnt has been dawn into a war which hs
too hastily entered upon; but trIust tbat by vigorous measures "nsI a successful issue of the peaceful mission oE the distinguished diplonmtist towhom, since the reent Hoeof Commons, the bonour and interests of this country have been confided by Her Maety's Government, it will be brought to a speedy codnciuson."
Mr. Henry John Selwin comes forward as the Conservative colleague of Mr. Cobbold, and published his address, also, on Friday. He condemns the conduct of the English represen. tatives at Canton, but " now that the deed is done And the honour of the country is at stake," he will give no ",factious vote" against the Government. Mr. Selwin further declares himself against the measure for the abolition. of churchrates, isopposed to theMaynothgrantanrefrd the ballot, and consder tht ay frthr Prlimenaryreformn is uncalled forby hecoutryatpreent H isatthe same time a strongsupporter of law rseforms,anadvocate ttfor a careful revision of the national expenditure, and the ainmost irine-

Aciair, the present Liberal member, offers himself for re-election, and in an address published on Frid says he is no advocate for a "turbuelent or aggresiy
policy," but ho should have given Lord Paloerston and his colleagues his support on the late Canton debate, ea he conceives it is vitaly necessary "that our fellow-countrv men, when they are unjustly attacked or op,pressed, should
be protected and our treaties with foreign rlowers enforced and respected." Mr. Adair further avows his intention to support a nh e xnsion oballot, the abolition ofurch-rates "andothr le measure famelioration inall , ouFr deaaren ts." Mr. Adair and Mr J. C. Mearsh-

Charles Cavendih Crluion d, the crivate seretary to the Premier, another candidate has been to contest the meat vacated by Colonel Harourt on Ceonservative prin6iplesMr. Thomas Willis Fleming, of South Stonehama. A sblic meeting was held in the losg room of the Grapes - otel, Cowes, on Friday evening, to hear Mr. Clifford explain his poitical opinions, M1r. Maturice Dear in the chair. Mr.
Olfodaddressed the meeting at considerable length. Mr. Alfred Barton moved and Mr. P. H. Matthews secndedthe following resolution, which was carried Unanimously :
"That Mr. Cliford's address was satisfactory to the maeeting and that be was a fit and proper Persn to reresent the Isle at Wight in the Commons House of P&rliacrnt."
LBzDs,-The division which has for some time extsted in tbo liberal pArty is in a great moasnx healdo1 and tbg"J4

He declared himself a voluntary in education, and as opposed to the Maynooth and all religious gants. He was questioned at some lengtb, after whitch it was resolved unmnimously to take lim to the poll.
MALDON.-MessTS. Peacocke and Bkamley-M3ore, the sitting Conservative members for this borough, are likely to find a formdable opponent in the person of Mr. Sutton Western, of Felx Hill, near Maldon ; that gentleman having tal-en the field in the Liberal interest under most pro=sng auspiees. In conhsequence of the expreseion of optmon im Mr Western's behalf, the Conservatives are gathering up their forces, and at a very large meetiog held on Thursday a resolution was adopted approving the Parliamnentary career of the sitting members, and pledging the meetirg to secure theirretmun at the ensuing election.
NEWPORT (Isa= OF WsIGHT.)-This borough be hotly contested. Mr. Alderman Rose, of the City of London, has entered the field. On the Liberal side there are Captain Mangles, of the Royal Mail Steampacket Company, and Mr. Buxton, son of Sir Fowell Buxton. 3Mr. Alssey, the Under-Secretary of State, one of the lto sitting members, has withdrawn.
NonRor.x (Es1).-The sadden retirement of Mr. H. N. Burroughes and Sir H. J. Stracey, the Conseryative candidates for this division, has excited a good deal of surprise and regret among their supporters. There appears to be a very prevalent opinion that at least one Conservative might have been returned, and that the contest was needlessly given up. Mr. Bmrroughes was re-elected without opposition in 1852, and Sir H. Stracey wras returned without a struggle in 1855 ; and the acquisition of the two seats by the iaberal candidates, Majior-Genleral Windhaim and Sir Bt. N. uxton, is one of the most important political changes yet noticed in the Eastern Counthes.
NORTHALLZERTox.-The Hon. E. Lascelles, brother to the present Earl Of Harewood, and a Consenvative, is a candidate for this borough, the prssent representative beine Mr W. B. Wrightson. After canvassing the electors, Mr. 'LasceUles has issued a second address, in wihich he speaks
confidently of hlis return.
NOMNGHAXAs-Mr. Ernest Jones has issued another ad, dress, and expresses his determinationto go tothe polL He has not, however, the remotest chance of success, as the majority of the electors are well satisfied with their present members. On Fridayrnight there was a meeting of the Liberal party, when tt was resolved to support Mr. Paget.
OXFoRDCrrY.--Atpresent thereisnottheslightestchance of either of the new candidates (both Liberals), Mr. C. Neate and Serieant Gaselee, retiring from the contest. The former gentleman, who has been residing in Oxford many years, is Senior Fellow of Osiel College, and formerly filled the situation of pnvato secretary to Sir F. Baring while Chanellor of the Exchequer. Serjeant Gaselee's bold expressions of his political sentiments have given great satisfaction to the Liberal electors, but it is admitted by all that if beth go to the poll Mr. Cardwell must win.
OXEonDscnmt-The rumour is still rife that the return of MIr. Henley and Colonel North will be opposed, Both gentlemen have issued addresses to the electors, but not a word do they say relative to their vote against Iord Pal. merston on the Chinese question. Mr. Harcourt has also addressed the electors, and thus alludes to the Canton afflair :
" I shal nok disu the cndnuct of or authorities, civil and naval, at Canton. It may possibly not have been nooessary to employ such strong meanres without the xanction of our Govenmetnt, but this toplo has been used, not for the imeroveisent of our position there, but In order to embarras and, if poiMble, t3 overset an Administratri which deseves, in ny opinion, our gratitude for its resolute conduct of the Russian war and ib resolute resistance to unsatisfactory tenmnof peace. Ibelievethatthebestmean arenow adopted eorendeavouring to place us on a becoming footing with the thinese em-
ire, and I am peraded that you will wish me to give to the Gover ment, in that respect, my ready support."
PORTsmoIuTII.-A hot canvrss, the forerunner of a hot contest, is going on in this borough. Viscount Monck has completed his canvass with most satisfactory promise. In aTn adress to the electors his Lordship says,-
The reslt of tho canvas In my favouz leaves zno doubt thatyou Wi do me the honour of returning me a third time ss o.,r reDresentative in Parlament. While I thank you heartily for your kind promlees, let me ask the fnrther favour of your early attendance at the Don on the day of election, which wil probably take place on Saturday rest, theo 2th inst."
Sir James Dahymple Horn El Iphistone issued his address to the electors on Saturday. le says,-
I believe that muLch may yet be dons to 14zhton the burdons of the taxpayers and cheapen the necessaries of life without unduly treuchiug on the emclency of our establishrnente. I am opposed to centralzation, and, being unconnected with any Government, I slbould feel bound, in al local matters, to make evr exertion to Promote the interesb of your borough. I am an advocate for rating all Government Property to the poor-rate. The result of the voto which has prodnced the dimsolution of Parlilament has been to oblge Lord Palmeraton to appoint one of the most talented and able men of the day s Plenipotentiary to China, and I trust he wi be sup ported by a foroe sufficient to place our relations with that country on a footing of permanent security. I am in favour of an extension of tbe franchie by a progresire and careful reviion of the present law. I am oppossed to the Maynooth grant, and will advocate the mlutenanoe, of the Protestantils of the coDutry in its ffll integrity."
On Saturday evening Sir James addressed a great meeting of 2000 electors and inhabitants at Portsea, Mv. Alderman Cornelius Stigart, ex-isyor, presiding. The candidate having addressed the meeting explanatory of his political sentiments as foreshadowed in his address, and several electors having also spoken, the following resolution was put and carried, all but four hands in the room being held up
"That in the opinion of this meetingtbe *Ime has nowarrived for the emancipation of the borough frotm the Influences under which i. has labonred for so manyyears, by which ie commercial progress has been so much hindered anad its importance diminished. That it I essential to omr interests that some change should take place In out representation, and that Sir JamesMphinstone ha candidate in every way worthy the support of the electos
The meeting ended with a great display of enthusiasm, and a resolution to place Sir James at the head of the polL
PRtESTOw.-The election contest for this town threatens to be a severe one, and a very active canvass is being made by the committees of the three candidates-two Liberals and one Conservative. Sir George Strickland addresssed a large number of his constituents on Saturday evening in the Imperal lHotel. In his remarks the hon. baronet expressed his conviction that the town would be truo to its interests and return two Liberal members. He had never been a servile follower of any Government whatever. Ie wlent into Parliament an independent man, and, if returned, he would continue so. He had voted more frequently against than for Lord Palmerston, instancing the fact that he had voted for the ballot and Locke Ring's motion. lord Palmerston, he3 said, was deserving of the tl:ank-s of the comty, because he thought he was by far the best Foreign Minister the nation had ever had. Sir George then referred to the various exciting topics of the day, and expressed his intention of supporting such reforms as mightlead to the advantage of the country.
SExuns (Sou'rH).-It is announced that Mr. Ingham will address the electors of this borough before the general election. There is no prospectthat the hon. gentleman will be opposed.
SEatEwsBuRY.-The present promises to be one of the severest contests this borough has ever witnessed. Mr. Slaney, Liberal, who represented the borough in six Parliainents, and is now again a candidate, arrived from Turin on Friday, and immediately commenced an active canvass. On Saturday evening he addressed a arge number of the electors at the Lion HoteL He rested his claims to their sulrrages on his former conduct in Parliament, he havinz been intimately assciated with all the reforms that b
been carried during the last 30 years, and more especially vith those having for their object the political and social amelioration of the humbler classes of the community. If returned to the new Parliament he promised to devote himself chiefly to the consideration of the same benevolent objects. He expressed no opinion respecting the conduct of the present Ministry or the Opposition. Mr. Tomline, the Liberal Conservative candidate, has not yet addressd the electors. Mr. Huddleatone and Major Phibbs, the Tory candidates, delivered lengthy speeches (for the second time) in the Music-hall on Saturday evening. Bot ara opposed to the Maynooth
rant and to the abolition of church-rates, unless provision is made for the maintenance of the fabric, MIajor Phibb- i5 opposed to the admission of Jews into Parliament, and both candidates are in favour of a great reduction in the income-
STAYIoi;sDnsnm (SOum).-At a meeting of the electors of South Staffordshire, heldat Wolverhampton on Saturday afternoon, Mr. W. Mathews, ironmaster, and Mr. Foley, eldest son of Mr. Hodgetts Foley, MLP. for Esst Worcestershire, complied with the solicitation of the requisitionists and consented to stand for this division of the county of Stafford. Both gentlemen, had they been in Parliament, vould have voted against Mr. Cobden's motion. There is not likely to be any opposition, as the majorityragainst Lord Iugestre at the last contest has settled the subject for some years to come.
STAD-FO"-LOrd Robert Cecil and Sir F. Thesiger have both issued addresses solicting re-election. Lord II Cecil in reference to the Chinese dispute says -
*- The alleged Inst oa the part of the Chinese appears from the papers toh ve beenneolusut, but auet of autheritylegalyjuatliaible ; and, even if it had bee an isalt, the atonuent exacted had been ample and abundant before the mercles destruction of the city or Canton began. This was the view taken by a majority of the House of Commons, including every single man of aiy srt of distinction,
rith the exception of those who hold ofice. Tbis remarkable agreement is of itself so strong an evidence of the justicoe of the vote that an attempt has been rnade by the Government to cinry it as a ' coalition for factous purposes.' But It is aimply ridicuous to E suppose that men so opposed in aims and felings ea }fr. Layad and Mrr. Gladstone, Sir Francis Baring and tBrd Stanley, Mr. Itoebuck snd Mr. Cobden, Mr. Christopher and Mr. William Williams, Lord John RueeU and Mr. D uIsr e wouldhave any 'factious purDoses' in cimmon, orcouldbe drawn into the same lobby by anythingelse thante ovewhelming merits of the ca."
Sir F. Thesiser, in reference to the same subject, ays tbat the lart he took was not the result of preconcert or combination with any one, butwas theexpression of his own independent and conscientious onviction, after a most care-
fuland anxious consideration of the whole of the papers. In conclusion, Sir Frederick says:
"Upon althogre at questisofthedaryo knowbow I bavoact

ADVERTISING FOR CANDIDATES.-The following
ADVERTISING FOB OANDrDATES.-The following curious advertisement appears in the Berwie*- Advcrtiqcr of Saturday:-"Wanted, a candidate for the representation of the county of Berwick in the Commons House of Parliament, the present hon. member not having, as yet, signified his intention of again comin forwardl Parties of mode. rately Liberal principles, and having the other requisite qTulifications, are entreated to make immediate application."
THE OpEnAT1ros AT CA2-ToX.-"FurtherPapers" relative to the proceedings of Her Majesty's naval forces at Canton were lhid before the late Parliament a few days ago-, and published on Saturday. The correspondence, as may be supposed, relates exclnEively to the details of the operations of the English forces at the seat of war. The most remarkable paper is a "notice" Lpurporting to be) isued by tho whole district of Sing-n (n-on), peporily prohibitinm the supply of provisions to the "Tr" ii barbarisus." This document is a precious specimen of the friendly disposition of the Chinese towards us, and of the meroy and loving kindness which may reasonably be expected at their hLnds. The preamble, so to speak, of the "notice" recites that " the English outlaws, runinn riot in rebellion and bearing themselves eontumaciously and insolently to China, had for a series of years committed mnore crimes than hairs can be plucked from the head to number ;" yet, notwithstanding their unbearable insolence, the Chinese Government was mercifaUy pleased, when they treated for peaceo, to extend to them "extraordinary favour, to forgive them their past offences and to allow them to trade at Victoria and other parts of liongkong." Instead of repenting (as it behoved them) of their faults, "a heart of mschief lay -withinthe English) " "their cupidity was insatiable." After sundry accusations of outrage and violence, the culminating offence of theEnglish,-theattackon Canton,-is denounced ;-"rude as tho boar andea erasthe wol£ they have pusbedtheirrebellion far." bhe hio h authorities of China, however, were stil liberal and indulgent, and, in a Christian spirit, refused to retaliate, until at length ." thebrmtenature"'of the English, waxing moreand moreferocious and perverse, thev ventured the length of scalingthowallsandenteringthecity. "'l'heyarea poisonto life.

It is intended to attach the dep6ts of the 23d Wilsh 'dkW)eers 82dRegiment, 9OthI3nhtI*fsatfry Ad9Sd m -the head quarters of which are under 4rderto es or China-to the Providional Battalion, ChAthan, au :o room can be provided for them at that garrison; - ,
Somointerestingexperiments bare been mde at lhat.- ham in the presenec of the officers of the Royal EoBi6err,s
nnder the sanction of the Secretary of State for War, for the, purpose oftesting the merits of an invention aubuittea toLord Pauniure, whicb, it was conddered, would have the effect of giving increased effoet to the charge of gunpowdeiused in the mapping and mining oporations carried on by the. men of the Royal BEgineers at Chatham. Astrong box wAsproposed to be made capLble of containing a charge ef 15Obf
weight of gunpowder; onesideofthis box,whichWAsallowl to remain open, was placed in the ordinary anner apinst a large beam of timber, intended to represent a stockade* On the charge being ignited bymeans of the voltaiO.baltterY
the beam was blown to a distanee of 15 feet. Another box was then made, to contai the same weight of gznpowder; beut firmly closed on aU sides; the effect of the explosion ha this inatance was to send the balk of timber a few inches. over 15 feet. A third experiment ws then made with a, box of the same size, and fiUed with the same weeight o
gunpowder used for tho former charges, but in this instane-t a portion of the box was covered 'with sandbags, placed atthe sides, for the purpose of acting as a resistance to the gunpowder in that direction, the principle being the xamet as that hitherto adopted in the Royal Engineers. On thel powder being fired the charge blew the beam of timber tcthe distance of 50 feet, thus proving the superiority of the.- methods pratised by the Sappers and Miners. The retulig of the experiments were considered very satisfaetory to thaEngineer officers.
The launch of the Renown, 91, wil take place at Chatham on Saturday afternoon next. T
