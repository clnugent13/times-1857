I EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris correspondent, dated yesterday, 6 p.m.:- In my letter of Sunday last, speaking of the place that would be selected for the Peace Conferences, I mentioned that the French Government had not, and would not, demand Paris, but that, if proposed by England, they would make no objection. I beEeve I can now inform you that Paris is the place selected. The Emperor Napoleon proposed to the English Government that London should be the place, and the English Goveranent, not to be outdone in courtesy, fixed on Paris, and expressed a hope that no objection would be made. This choice, of course, gives satisfaction here, and has been readily acquiesced in by Russia. Each Government will no doubt put its beat champion forward to represent it on the occasion, and the public voice seems to approve before-- band the choice that would be made of Lord Palmerston; nor would Lord Clarendon be an unpopular one. The Russian Government has fixed on 3I. Branow as its representative. It is not true, by the way, as has been stated, that an intimation has been madeto Prussia that her acceptance of the Austrian propositions is a sine qua non? to her admission to the Conferences. I believe no intimation has been made to her on the subject; and it is to be hoped that Prassia will be left in the same inglorious loneliness in which her own choice has placed her. - I should have said that the Russian Government previously ascertained that DI. Brunow would not be objected to by England and France. ML de Buol is spoken of as the Austrian Plenipotentiary. A letter from Constantinople, after giving some intelligence without interest from the Crimea, states, on the authority of letters from Trebizond, dated the 5th, that the communications were stil interrupted by the state of the weather. It was thought that if it improved, the army of Omar Pasha would enter into campaign and concentrate at Erzerouna, which was said to be menaced by the Russians. The Rediffs and Bashi-Bazouks who surrendered after the capitulation of Kars had been disposed of in that place. As, by the laws of war, they cannot bear arms against Russia before the close of the campaign, they have been sent to the towns of the interior. The letter goes on thus "On the demand of Dr. Banden, Marshal Pelissier has just decided that the convalescents who could not quit the hospitals of Constantinople to return to the Crimea without eanger of relapse on account of the severity of the weather, will remain tiU spring at Constantinople. " General Larchey and M. Angols, Intendant, had made I reparations for the constrction of new huts, which are now erecting near the camp of Masla, as a depot for convalescents, and every attention will be given to providing them with nourishment suited to their condition." The 1%abmor brings the text of the iltimnatumad. dressed to Persia by Mr. Murray, the British Minister. This document requires--1st. That the Persian Government shall set at liberty the Princess, the wife of Airza. 2dly. That it shall recognize Mirna as Consul of the Queen of England; and 3dly, that the Prime Minister of the Shah shall proceed to the English Embassy to there make an apology and withdraw his insulting note. Mr. Murray, in spite of some resistance, left an agent at Teheran, and threatened that he should be supported by an English squadron in the Persian Gulf. The CVaistiania Courier of the 11th inst. quotes the following letter from Tromsoe (Norway):- Daring the blockade by the allied fleets in 1855 of the Russian ports of the White Sea, not a single neutral vessel appeared in that sea, but many Russian vessels endeavoured to take advantage of the fogs, which are veryfrequent there, to-reach the Norwegian coast. Most of them, that is about 60, were captured by the combined squadrons. They had full cargoes on board, and as it was impossible to send them to England or France, the captors destroyed them by fre, after taking out their cargoes. The inhabitants of several small towns, situate on the White Sea, sold provisions to the allied squadrons, but the moment th Russian Government was informed of it, orders were teceived to discontinue all further intercourse with the enemy, and the delinquents were threatened with banishment to Siberia. In the meantime great exertions were mnade to excite the religious fanaticism of the inhabitants, among whom a blessed medal or amulet was distributed, which was infallibly to protect them against the arms of the tnbelierers, the name given to the English and French by the Russimauthorities. One nay form an idea of the inJury inflicted on ihe Russian trade by the fact that, in time of peace, nolessthan 600 vessels, measuring 120,ODO tns, enter the Russian harbours on the White Sea, independently of Norwegian and national vessels." At the close pf the market the commissary of the Bourso announced that he had received orders to contradict the report of an insurrection at St. Petersburg, no despatch of such a purport having been received by the Government. The Emperor yesterday visited the Palace of St. Cloud, to give orders for different prepaations to be made for the reception of the Empress, who, it is raid, is about shortly to takoup her residence there. The Emperor, ,on the proposition of the Minister of War, has appointed a special commission charged to examine an improved code of militW justice, The body in question is composed of M. Earoche, is President, GeneralAllard, GeneralCount de la Ruf, and MB. Lang;ais, Petitet, de Royer, Bouland, Duvergier, Foucher, and Chasseriau. "We are inWormed," says the Cosf itonnel,- B"y our correspondent at Turin, that L Massliso, d'Azeglio is namred as the representative of Piedmont at the approaching conSerences." The Aonifeur publishes the returts of the corn -trade in the different markets of France, during. the last week of December and the first fortnight of Janiury, from iwhich it appears that the average 15TIoe of the hectolitre of wheat, during that period, 'was 32f.- 20c. at Toulouse, Gray, Lyons, and Marseilles;132f. 47c. at M1arans and Bordeaux; :32f. 72c. at St. laurent and Le Graud Leaps; ;31f. 49c. at Mulhouse And Strasburg; 35f. 87c. at:Bergues, Ans, Roye, gois sci0, Paris, and Rouen; 31f. 60c. at -wantes and Sauanurj 1.9 85c. at Metz, Verdun, and Charleville and 31f. 5Wk. at St. La, Paimpol, Quimper, and Hennebon.

The receipts of the Orleans Railway diuing the week ending on the 19th inst. were 884,247f., or 130,148f. more than during the orrespondin,g week of 1855.

Things are for the moment at a standstill, there being a difference of opinion between the allies on the subject of the interpretation to be given to the fifth proposition. England stoutly maintains that Russia must; not again be permitted to fortify the east coast of the Black Sea, and Austria and France propose that the question should be left in abeyance until the Peace Conferences have met. The British Government is, however, extremely. desirous to come to a clear understanding -with its allies on such an important point before it again enters the diplomatic lists, and therefore a fewv days may elapse before the preliminaries of peace are signed. A diplomatic correspondence respecting the Aland Islands and the Caucasian coast is now going on between the allies of the 2d of December, and therefore considerable reserve is necessary on my part'; but it may be observed that it is. perhaps, not absolutely necessary that England should insist on the eastern coast of the Black Sea " being disarmed." Russia has herself destroyed the whole chain of forts on the Caucasian coast, and therefore the object of the British Govermnelnt would be attained if the status qto should there be maintained. The less that is said or written about the northern forts of Sebastopol the letter it wiU be for all parties, as neither France nor Austria are inclined to deprive Russia of what is now called her " legitimate means of defence." It mav appear somewhat strange that the person who a few days ago called the attention of the public to the fact of the omission of the important word " forts" in the third proposition of the allies should make such remarks as the foregoing, but you may believe that there are very exellent reasons for my so- doing. In order to avoid a schism, France and Austria may perhaps be induced to agree with England that the AlandIslands must not again be fortified, that the Consuls of the Allied Powers must be allowed to reside at the different Russian ports in the Black Sea, and that the stattus quo must be maintained on the eastern coast of the Black Sea, but neither the one nor the other Power is likely to go further. A London correspondent of the Attgsbu,.g Gazette, in his letter of the 15th inst., writes that England communicated both to France and Austria the sense which was to be attached to the 5th proposition, "but the Austrian Government did not inform the Russian Cabinet that it meant :--1. No more fortifications in the Aland Islands. 2. Consuls in all the Russian ports in the Black sea. 3. The disarming of the Circassian coast." It is unknown to me what truth there may be in the first part of the foregoing statement; but certain it is that men high in office aver that Count Buol was not informed of the exact sense of the fifth proposition until after Count Valentine Esterhazy had left Vienna. The protocol containing the preliminaries of peace has not yet arrived from St. Petersburg; but it is related that Prince Gortschakoff has received instractiors to sign it as soon as it comes to hand. Yesterday morning an Austrian Cabinet messenger brought despatches from St. Petersburg, but he had left before the propositions had been accepted. According to the Ost-Deutschc Post, the British Minister yesterday received an invitation to dine at Court, but such was not the case. It has produced a very singular impression here that the news of the acceptance of the propositions was not contained in the Moniteur of the 17th, as it is well known that the despatches of diplomatic men are always forwarded before the messages of private individuals. That the important news was taken advantage of in Paris at an early hour is certain, for telegraphic orders from Viemna to buy French Rente could only be executed on payment of remarkably high prices. As you must be aware, it was almost midday when the official despatch was posted on 'Change. The assertion of the Ereu3 Zeitnig, that it was owing to the exertions of Prussia that Russia yielded, has made Austrians in office so wroth that they openly express their contempt for the " emasoulated policy" of the Berlin Cabinet. The Oesteereidcische Cerrespondenz contains a long article in defence of the conduct of the captain of the Austrian Lloyd steamer Imperatrice, which some time since ran down-the French steamer Cygne, in the port, of Constantinople. The case is to be examined into by the "competent Austrian Consular Court" at Constantinople, and not, as has been stated, by a commission. composed of Austrian, English, and French naval officers. The M1inisterial organ considers. it necessary to add that the Consular Court wll be strictly impartial. The National Loan has risen to 82i, which is about 5 per cent. higher than it was on the 16th. It is the very height of the Carnival, and, as the Viennese dance all night and sleep half the day, you -will not be surprised to learn that there is a great dearth of news. PRUSSIA. (FROM our. oww coRu&qro.NxN-r.) BERLIN, JA2. 24. The day before yesterday I mentioned toyou the unexpected arrival at Copenhageni of three siall English vessels of war; the commander of ore of which, Captain Warrea , of the Driver, imme- diaelr on_his arrval landed and repaired to the British mission. A correspondent of the K6einischc Zeitong states that Captain Warren was the bearer ;of a despatch from our Government to Mr. Buchanan, our Minister there, instructing him 1to apply to the Danish Government for two harbours, as a winter station for our veiselz Istill cruizing in the Baltic and Bay of Finland. iMr. Buchanan is said to have repaired at I once to the MIinister for Foreign Affairs, Here von Scheel, and made him acquainted with the. desire of our Government, showing him at the same time the impossiiLity of our maintaining a strict blockade if all oiur Ahips were Att any timet to be compelled to leave those waters: The Minister undertook to lay the request before theBing in Council, he himself not beiiig able to ddei so grave a matter on his sole responsibility; ani a; he required the matter to be put before him in a - tanfgible form Mr. Buchanan forwarded him a not3 upon the subject the same day. The Council of State that sat on the 11th instantis believedto have been occupied with this subject, ana to have come to the resolution not to comply with. the request, on the ground that any such compliance would be a breach of the laws of noutrality. This answer was immediately telegraphed home and produced a rejoinder on the l4th to the effect that England 7must insist on having two ports opened to her fora few vessels of war to winter in. This message in the form of a diplomatic note was immediately handed by our representative to the Danish M1inister, with the request that he wouild forward him Denmark's final resolution as soon as possible. This correspDndentof theKotnerZcitui?g affirms very positively that at the sitting of the Privy Council on the 16th, at which the King presided, this subject was brought under discussion; but he is not able to state as yet (17th inst.) what the result was; only this much he knows, that the English Minister keeps sending off to, and receiving telegraphic despatches from, London. All that Ihaveto add to this statement is, that although the correspondent's letter -was written as far back as the 17th inst., it has not yet been confirmed by any other publc correspondence from Copenhagen. Letters from Paris have of late spoken of differences of opinion having already arisen between Sweden and the Western Powers, but which in the overwhelming interest of the prospects of peace were being overlooked. Sweden had concluded the treaty with the Western 'Powers, and by its means acquired a guarantee and security for her dominions; however, when it came to the pinch, she was unwilling to render any counter service ; probably the rumours of approaching negotiations with Russia on the part of Austria as month-piece of the Western Powers, may have rendered her doubly unwilling to compromise her position. What the Western Powers were said to require of Sweden was stated to be the opening of the Swedish harbours to the vessels of the allies during the next approaching Baltic campaign; this Sweden hesitates to do, as incompatible with the neutrality that she still proposes to herself. For the purpose of changing these views of the Swedish Cabinet it was mentioned that Admiral Jurieu was about to enter upon a mission to Stockholm, and as was the case -with General Canrobert, would extend that visit to Copenhagen. According to the colour of the Paris news we get now, we may infer that the Admiral's mission will for the present re- main in abeyance,- while if the news of thaKo1nischer - Zeitzong be correct, the English mission is already in process of being carried out. The King of Swedem issued instructions on the 5th ultimo that 25,00O lylSyfund of saltpetre should be ordered from England, and be imported duty free into Sweden. The local government of the town of B3dle has sent in a complaiat to the Coucil of the Swiss Confederation on the subject of the conduct of certain English recruiting agents, who refuse to give up to the authorities young men who are amenabl1 to punishment, and have endisted for thea purpose of escaping that punishment. The Federal Council is understood to have put forward its grievance on this point in London. The Russiau .5inister in Berne has been instructed by his Government to apply to the Federal Council for a carbine and rifle, as used in the Federal milit-ary service. The War Department has received instructions to comply with this request, as had already previously been done by others of a similar nature. General Rfidiger is said to be dangerously ill, and General Osten Sacken has for the present; taken his command. letters from Constantinople mention that Mr. Alison,Oriental attacl at theBritish Embassythere, had been despatched by Lord Stratford de Redeliffe on a special mission into Wallachia, to inquire into the true causes of the differences existing between Prince Stirbey and theEnglish Consul in Bucharest. Thi;s miission is believed also to be in some degrea connected with the approaching conferences for the regulation of the future administration of the Principalities, whiclh will begin as soon as the Ambassadors of England and France have received their instructions. Advices from Galatz of the 5th inst. state that despatche3 are arriving there every day from shipowners in the north. inquiring if their vessels have passed the Sulina or are still lying in the Danube. For the information of all parties interested, -these letters state, that Galatz has baan ever since the 16th of December cut off from all communication wit Tultscha and Sulina, in consequence of the Danube being frozen over, while the land-roads ara at the sanme tinie impracticable. The road from Tultscha to Sulina labours further under the inconvenience of running through a perfectly desolated country, and being infested -with bandits. From Rustechuk, however, under date of 3d inst., the statements run that the ice on the Danube is so fir that heavy loads are forwarded upon it by sledges and vwaggons. This species of communication has been for some days establshed between the towns lying up the river. On the 2d inst. 25 vehicles, that have been built in Bucharest for the English Land Transport Corps, aTrived in Rustchuk, and were forwarded the next day to Varna. ITALY. The Anrwzonia of Turin announces that, in consequence of Russia's acceptance of the Austrian prao positions, the enlisting offices for the Anglo-Italiart legion have ceased their operations. The Duchess of Parma, with a view to alleviating the position of the persons holding inferior Stata employments in her States, has just published a decree ordering that all persons whose salary is tlot superior to 1,200f. a year shall receive during the --first three months. of 1856 an augment&tion of a- third of their salary. The benefit of thic decree is also be extended to the officers and noncommissioned officers of the army. As to the Private soldiers, each man is to receive an augmenta. tion of seven centimes per day duing the time specified. The situation of the Pontifical Bank at Rome up to January 14 stood as folows :-Assets, 3,609,09D scadi; liabilities,.2,519,032sudi; leaving abalance (including capital and reserve) of 1,09D,057 scuai.

GEOLOGICAL DISCOVERIES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. I Sir,-In reference to the paragraph entitled " Curious Geological Discovery," which appeared in your columns yesterday, relative to the remains of an ancient forest having recently been discovered beneath the mud, sand, and silt of the "pool" at the new dock at West artlepool, and to the antlers of deer having been found in the thick bed of vegetable matter formed by the decomposition of the trees and other plants, I may be allowed to mention that vithin the last few days similar vestiges of a period long gone by have been discovered here, while an excava. tion-prelimrinary to the erection of a chimney-shaft-was being made in the immediate vicinity of the principal storehouses of this establishment. When the made-ground had been removed to tha depth at which the foundation of the chimney was intended to be laid, the loose and variable nature of the soil indicated the necessity of proceeding further with the excavation; and in the course of that operation the stump and roots of a large oak (which had apparently grown on the spot, and been sawn offat or near the former level of that part of the south I bank of the river) were discovered. Around the stump was a quantity of partiaUy decomposed sawdust and wood shavings, while between and under its roots were gravel and broken flints, with fragments of smal scallop shells, mixed with alluvial deposit, the latter resting upon a bed of solid peat. With the view of ascertaining whether the thickness of the peat was considerable, a hole was dug in it to the depth of five feet; and, together with numerous roots of willow, there was found among the soil thus disturbed one of the horns of a roebuck1 The spot whence this interesting and perfectly-preserved relc was obtained is about 60 yards in rear of the Arsenalwbarf, 20 feet beneath the present surface of the ground tere, and nearly two feet above Trinity low water-mark I am, Sir, your verv obedient servant R.

MONZYfY-ARKETanM CITY INTELLIGBN C. Friday Evening. The English funds have shown diminished buoyancy to-day, and have losed at a reaction of a half percent. Consols for money, which left off yesterday at 90 to J, were first quoted 90 to s, whence they graduilly declined to 901 to i, at which they remained to the ternination of business. For the 7th of February the last price was 90k. The prineipal cause of the heaviness seemed to consist in an increased demand for money, consequent upon some rather heavy sales by an influential broker and the payment of the final instalment on the Turkish loan. A few days back advances on stock for short periods could readily be obtained at 6 per cent., and this afternoon they were in great demand at 6 per cent. Lower prices from France likewise contributed to the prevailing heaviness. There was still a complete absence of political news, and the feeling with regard to the prospects of peace does not appear to have undergone any change. In well-informed quarters an impression is gaining ground that the approaching conferences will be held in Paris. Bank Stock closed at 209 to 210; Reduced, 90k; New Three per Cents., 9Ol; Long Annuities, 3i; Annuities, 1885, 16i; aIndia Stock, 218 to 220; and Exchequer-bonds, 97-i to 98. Indiabonds and Exchequer-bills were affected by the demand for money, and left off at 6s. to 2s. discount. There was again great activity in foreign seciurities, and some fluctuations ensued in prices. At the commencement of business much firmness was exhibited, but subsequently the market became weak, and sales then effected caused a partial decline.- In Turkish Six per Cents. the operations for money were at 91X and 90, and for the account at 91k, !, 89-, 90g6 90, and 90k. The New Guaranteed Four per Cent. Scrip was negotiated at i, k, and J discount. The final payment having been made today, it will henceforth appear as Turkish Guaranteed Four per Cent. Stock, and the closing price was 102. The other transactions comprised-Austrian Five per Cents., 8G and 85A; Brazilian, 101; the Small, 100 ; the Four-and-a-Half per Cents., New, 93X; Chilian Six per Cents., 103t; Ecuador, 5k; Granada New Active, 191 ; the Deferred, 7; Greek, 6¢;Mexican, for account, 21, 20k, andli; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 79, 79k, anda; the Three per Cents., 65J; Portuguese-Four per Cents., for the account, 471 and 48-; Russian Five per Cents., 104!; Sardinian Five per Cents., for money, 89i and 84; for the account, 88k; Spanish Three per Cents., for the account, 40i and 41; the New Deferred, for account, 23i and 23; Venezuela, for account, 28; Austrian Five per Cents. (payable abroad), 76; and Dutch Four per Cent. Certificates, 95g. In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rate upon Paris was again rather lower. Amsterdam and Hamburg were the same as last pest. The corn-market was less unsteady this morning, but without any positive change in prices. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a further advance of 1-lGd. to id. per lb., but with a tendency to diminished animation at the close. The last quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 68f. 45c. for money and 68f. 65c. for the end of the month, showing a decline of more than three-quarters per cent. At Amsterdam the marketfor Dutch stock is without alteration, but Russian and Portuguese continue to advance. The Champion of the Seas has arrived from Port Phillip with 124,000 ounces of gold, valued at 490,000!. Thedate of her departurewas the 27th of October. As the accounts from the Bank of France are understood to have been lately of a more favourable character, it is thouglht that a portion of this amount will be taken to the Bank of England. The prospectus has been issued to-day of the Bank of Egypt, which has been some time in course of formation. The capital will be 250,0001., in shares of 251., with power of increase to 1,000,0001., and the board of directors is composed of merchants and others of great respectability. The object of the establslsment is to supply those business facilities which have for some years been called for by the extraordinary increase of the resources of the country, especially as regards its grain exports and the overland traffic. The bank will be incorporated by a Royal charter, which has been granted by the English Government after commnunication with the Viceroy of Egypt. The prospectus has also been issued of a new metropolitan joint-stock bank, to be called the Western Bank of London. The proposed capital is 400,0001., in 1001. shares, and the chairman is Sir Henry Bulwer, while among the directors is Mr. Roebuck, M.P. The promoters call attention to the fact that this will be the first independent institution of the kind at the West-end, the existing joint-stock accommodation there being limited to that which is supplied by the branches of city establishnments. The advices from Hamburg state that large sales of Russian stock continue to be there for Berlin account. At the meeting of the Easterm Counties Railway which took place to-day, the motion for confirming the report of the committee, and requesting a continuance of their labours, was carried by a largp majority. A ballot is, however, to be taken, and as Mr. Waddington states that he holds proxies representing 1,379,280!., or 20,025 votes, while those obtained on behalf of the committee do not exceed 231,4701., or 4,299votes, this decision will, of course, be reversed. In the colonial produce markets during the week there has been a rather improved feeling, and prices are in many instances higher. An increased demand was manifested for sugar, and an advance was realized of fully i. per cwt., while in the West India descriptions operations were concluded to a larger extent than for some time past, both refiners and grocers being purchasers. Other classes have also been well taken; and thus, although a certain degree of timidity is yet observable, the favourable feature is presented of there being more frequent buyers even at enhanced quotations. E3xporters have likewise effected a fair amount of contracts,-a circumstance which had been anticipated, owing to the reduced state of the stores on the continent. To-day the market closed with dulness, the quantity offered being rather large. Nearly all was sold, however, and, although the better classes went at easier termns, extreme rates were obtained for the inferior kinds. Privately a good business has been transacted on the spot, while two cargoes-one of Pernambuco and one of Rio Grande-and a parcel of Manilla have changed hands afloat. In the tea-market there has also been a better feeling, and business has been effected in imost descriptions. Common Congou iswithoutalteration. For coffee the demand has been good. The plantation Ceylon kinds went offreadily at very full rates, while the native qualities were bought at a slight improvement. Large quantities of rice have been offered, nearly the whole of which went at 2s. to 3s. per cwt. below the highest quotation. Lately a very good business has been done, chiefly in iioating parcels, at prices about Gd. per cwt. above the lowest point. Saltpetre is exceedingly depressed, and sales are reported at lower quotations. The Peel River Company have issued their report, preparatory to their third annual meeting, on the 11th of February. It desclibes the results of Mr. Odernheimer's mineral survey, which has now been brought to a close, and which, notwithstanding the most careful experiments, has failed to open up any valuable goldfield, although the entire district examined shows the presence of the metal in small quantities, while the locality known as the Cordillera ground holds out a paying prospect, even at the present rate of wages. Under these circumstances it was resolved to reserve the latter, and to throw the rest open to the diagers at a license fee of 31. per month. Pn July 36 licenses were issued, and in August 51, but in September the total was only 15, the rate being considered too high. The Cordillera field was offered to an individual on lease at 1,500!. for six months or 2,4001. a-year, but declined. A mnall number of persons havetherefore been engaged to work it at certain- wages. The pastoral- and agricultural prospects of the company, on which reliance must henceforth be chiefly placed are stated to b3 making satisfactory progress. Up to the 30th df June last 4,474 sheep had been sold for 2,9661., and it was expected 160 head of cattle would be disposed of 'y the end of the year, when it was hoped S,he f2alstock remaining would comprise 70,000 sheep and 10,000 cattle. The capital in hand is 52,6521., of whclh 20,0001. has been authorized to be -expxernle4 ei the purcrasw of suatting atations, with a view to anincreased development of pastoral opera-: tions. The foUowing has been received with reference to the paragraph inserted on Monday regarding the London Wine Company:- Sir,-In your city article of the 21st inst. you notice the london Wine Company, and state in connexion therewith the name of Mr. Henry Robertson asM 'late of the fuim of Shaw, Maxwell, and Co.' Thepublic will infer from this that Mr. Robertson was a partner in the house, and that the business is extinct. Neither being correct, and your notice being calculated to do us considerable injury, we trust that you will, in justice to us, correct the statement, as the businems is carried on as umsal under the firm of W. J. a.well and Co. (Mr. Shaw's name having been withdrawn, be having ceased to be a partner on the 31st December, 1846). "WFe are, Sir, your obedient servants, ."4W. J. AWELL ASnD Co."

- RATILWAY INTELLIGENCE. EASh' COUNTIES. A special general meeting of the Eastern Counti% Rail'waY Vompany was held yesterday, pursuant to re.,uisition, at the london Tavern, Bishopsgate-street. The rcom was crowded to excess, and the majority of the persons present appeard to be under the influence of Arngry c erent. hae proceedings Were n-it quite so disorderly as at the last ameeting, but the spirit of turbulence manifested itself at intervas, and it is due to the proprietary to say that there occasionally occurred such wili scenes of uproar as worthily aushtined the reputation which the Eastern Counties Railway ompany has long enjoyed of being one of the noisiest cerporations in the empire. 3Mr. Waddington, M.P., the btir%nan, entered the room in company of the directors at 1 o'elock and was received with a shout of applause fro. ris friends, retorted with hisses axnd hootings from those who are less favourably affected towards him. The tumult wrhich his appearance elicited continued for some time, and tbe conflict of cheers and groans was kept up rery spiitedly, bLct upon the whole his reception was far less hostile than that which he experienced some weeks ago from the same assembly. He at once took the chair. The Secretary having read the requisition and the advertisement, Mr. SerjeW.t GASUEiE said that, as an independent proprietor, entirely unbiassed by vindictive feelings towards any person or party, he had a suggestion to offer which 'Would, as he believed, promote the regularity of their proaecediegs and carw their deliberations to be regarded with respect by the public. (Hear, hear.) The question about to be decided being, in effect, the fitness or unfitness of the chairman to be intrusted with the conduct of the company's affairs, he would appeal to that gentleman whether he would not best consult his own feelings by aHlowing some ,other person to take the chair on the present occasion| fCheers, hisses, and much tumult.) No doubt this suggeslion rmight be met by a reference to the act of Parliament, arid it night be contended that, until his period of office lad esxpired, which would not be until next month, the .chairman had a legal right to preside at such meetings as -the present; but if the chairman's feelings agreed -with his (Mr. Sericalnt Gaselee's), he would not stand aupon his legal right [A Voice.-'" He has got no feelings."), but would leave the room for a fer aninutes to enable the proprietors to elect some other memler of their body to act as chairmn.u (Cries of " Hear," nnd " No,") If the chairman wouad take this course he would be ina much better position to defend himself. (Cries *of "No.'} If, n the contrnry, he persisted in his deter. zunation totake the chairthat day,theresult of the meeting, 'whatever it might be, even though it should be to reinstate Idin offiice, would be viewed with deep dissatisfaction by -an immense minority of the shareholders, who regarded his 'coductwithgrave displeasure; andhe mightrelyuponitthat hisseatin thatchairwouldbe themost uneasyand disagreeable ht he had ever in his life occupied. (Cheers, groans, and laughter.) The Cas.TMLA1N (who was listened to with comparative -attention) said,-Upon the 7th of Decemberthere was a reso7ution passed in this room requesting that I would leave the chair. I then stated that until you had an opportunity -of reding the statement which I should put forth giving -an explanation of my conduct and defending myself against the harges made, I should not leave the chair. Upon the 11th of December aspecial board of directors was held, when 'thoee directors felt it to be their duty, in accordance with -the resolution passed by the proprietors, to request th:at I 'would cease to be a director of the company. I told them upon that occasion, as I had before told you, that I had a -complete answer to the charge (cheers and hisses); and that 'that answer should be forwarded -within a given time. I redeemaed my pledge (" Oh ! oh !" and cheers), and you are uet here to-day to decide-wiether or notIbave satisfactorily unswLeredtheaccusationsmade a,ainstme. ("No,no!"and "Y-estthe "Noea"prevailing ;butthemajorityofthe meeting -eutral-) As you decide to-day, so shall I determine whether or notl again take anypart in conducting the affairs -of this company; but until you shaU have decided the questiou wrhich is now before you, and the proprietors shall have had an opportnity of recording their vote, I shalhgive -the same answer as I have given hitherto, and shall retain the chair ofthis company. Cheers and uproar.) 3fr. BPRCE followed, and opened his remarks by observing upon a circular which had been advertised in the newspapers, the concoctors of which had had the audacity, he ssid to stato that theirlinewasin acondition of anarchy and confuson. (Cheers.) He declared that that assertion was unfounded, and, to prove that it was so,he stated that since fr.Waddington left the chair thotraffic had increased nearly -SC/t, a-week. He believed that many votes and proxies had been obtained by means of that circular-- Mr. HALT here rose to order. Was MLr. Bruce going to move a resolution ? Mr. BRUCE, amid considerable uproar, which rendered his remarks nearly inaudible, stated that it was his intention to do so. Ho v.as prepared to maintain allthe accusa-tions which he had originay made against M1r. Waddingtor6s manliement, and which had led to the appointment o"f the Committee of Investigation. He recapituLLted those -accusations, which Comprised the cooking of accounts, de'falcations in stores, improper leases, the charges with respect -to the Worth Woolw ich line, the East Sutiolk, and other miatterz, and denied that any of them had been answered. Heput it to the meeting whether they, as British merchants and British gentlemen, could for4et the past, and thus perrit the same things to occur an - He Lad never asked for a single vote or proxy; but he declared that the commercial honour of the country and the maintenance of every principle of right required that the meeting should support -the Committee of Investigation in a continuance of their labours. (Cheers, and "No, no '") For himself, all he could say was, that he should continue to do his best to see that statements of accounts were properly made, but he should never take ao. Active Part in the aeministration of their affairs so long as lJr- Waddington remained in the chair. It was said that .all the proceedings of the committee were the result of East Anglian influence.

Whatwas the state of the locomotive stock or of stores to the East Anglian -directrs? Nothing. If he had wanted to sacrifice their interests to the East Anglian Company,would he have taken the course that he had taken? (Conflicting cries of "Yes "' and "No !") Reverting to 2fr. WVaddington's statements, he urged that it told them all .about traffic, but nothing about the cost at which that trafflc was obtained; that it gave theni all the credits and none of the debits. In the case of tlhe N orth Woolhvich line, for example, MIr. Wad- lington had given them a flamirg account of the traffic, but ,had not said aword of an accident wvhich had occurred there in August last, and -which cost the company 8,1001. When that accident too; place the directors were told that it was a mere trifle, and that it would only cost soor., but they had found to their sorrow that it had cost them S,0001. (A Voice-"- Why, you are one of them.") He was told -that he was a director at the time; but individual directors were not expected to look into the minutiae of agreements, and matters of that description. (" Oh, oh r" and uproar,) In conclusion, Mr. Bruce moved- " That this meeting do confirm the resolution of the geneal meein" of the 31st of August Last, appointing a Coinsuittee of investigation, and that they be reouested to continue their labours till the 29th of February.' -Cheers and confusion.) Dr. RIEtxLy, in seconding the motion, took- occasion to -express his dissatisfaction that the section of shareholders -in complianice with whose re.uisition the meeting had been -convened should have put the proprietary to the trouble, expene, and inconvenience of assembling there that day; for they ought to have known that the general annual meeting would be held in a few days, and on that occasion they might e.xpect [A Voice.-" A Dividend'el (laugh-tcr.)-no; but more ample information than they at present possessed to guide them in arriving at a .sound decision upon the conduct of their directors, as -well as upon the selection of others to supply their places.

(Cheers.) When he thought -of the kindness which the company had at all times e:- uhbited towards Hudson and Waddington-when he remembered the cheers with which they used invariably -o receive every state-nrent which fell from the lips 'of thoee persons, as if al they said was gospel(laivghter), which it was not (continued laughter)-he had no -words to express his indignation at the manner in 'which such kindness had been requited. (Cheersand groans.) ¶Ilrey deserved to be placed in the hands of the public prose-ctors for makingt so ungrateful a; return for such generous favours. (Loud cheers, laghter, and hisses.) For 15 gears that he. (Dr Reilly) had been in the habit of attend- n1g the meetings of the company, he had been endeavouring direct their atteion to the scandalous manner in which theirafars weremanaged, but the proprietors would never listen to him (laughter and cheers); and now the result, 'which he had always foreseen, had at last falIen on thern-ruin, nothing less than ruin. (Cheers and laughter.) It was no fault of his -that theyhladnotgiven earto his warnings. Itwas rather ihis misfortune, for he was now involved in a common calamity with them, and had to endure the consequences .of a recklessness and improvidence which he hadI .done his best to avert.

The very snaJlness of his *"holding" wrould have deterred him from occupying so prominent a position. (A Voice.-" How many shares has raddinbton bore begy e it to be dins tinctly understod that the committee whth which he bad the onour of being connected held no proxies sent to them for any other purpose than the one which that corsnittee had been especially apone to promote. (HIear, hear.) Moreover, it should bet nown that the whole expense of the proies had been borne by Mr. Waddington, and that the committee had not fiched the halfcrowns of the prosietors. (Loud cheers, and lauohter.) In conclusion he waould submit it to the calm consideration of the meeting the following amendment and he felt adsured that by adopting they woaldhe taoing tat corse which Aould best conduce to their own interests:. "'Besolved, that this meeting, having^ reg"ard to the gene. zml position of the board of directors and the state of the company's affairs, is of opinion that the continuance of the powers and authorities vested in the Commit-tee of Investiga3tion appointed on the 3slt of August last, and confirmed and reappointed on the 7th of December last, is not consistent with the due and proper administration of those affairs, or calculated to further the interests of the shareholders, or to promote any useful purpose; and doth therefore resolve that all such powers and authorities do hereby cease and determine, ant that such coninuittee be and is hereby dissolved (shouts of "1 No, no I" and cheers); and this meeting, being of opinion that br. Waddington has fairly met and answered the charges brought against him (laughter, cheers, and ironical ap plause1 by the Commiftee of Investigation, and justified his geneTal policyof management (" No, no 1") further resolves that the dae and proper administration of the affairs of this company will be bestpromoted-byMr.Waddingtonresuminr the position in whic' he was before the appointment of such committee, and he is requested to resmme the functions and duties accordingly." (Cheers and hisses.) Alr. W. TEGG seconded the amnendment. Mr. HL=-s expressed his strong disapproval of it, obsenring that the conduct of the chairman and of those who had supported him in his ruinons policy was deeply reprehensible, and, if not reprobated by the company, could not fail to entail upon them the most injurious consequences. (Cheers.) That the directors had exceeded their legal powers and misapplied the funds of which thev were merely the trustees were facts which did not adnit of controversy. He attached great importance to that violation of duty, because it was to such misconduct on the part of chairmen and directors that were to be attributed many of the calamities that had befaUen the railway interest in this country. (Cheers.) However, he would not on the present occssion regard the olicy of the directors with any rmference to the question of legal principle. He would, forthe purposes of his argnment,dismissfrom consideration thatparticularview of the subcct, and would apply himself to these questions"Had the policy pursued by the chairman answered'! Had it served the interests of the company and promoted their prosperity?' He did not hesitate to assert that it had not done SD. {Cheers, and a cry of " Speak up, Helps It is a man of your name that we want he,e.") (Laughtr.) The speaker then proceeded to challenge the calulations of the chairman on nurnerous questions of inromneand expenditure, more particularly with reference to the chaimnan'sstatement that during his management there had been an enormous inerease in the earnisgs of the company. The fallacy of the chairman's computation consisted in thisthat he had contrasted the gross earnings at two dissimilar periods, instead of instituting a comparison betwveen the net returns during two corresponding seasons. (Hfear, hear.) The mileage of the company having been increased, it w2as but natural that the receipts should also be augmented; but it should be bornc in mnind that the expenses were enlarged and that the earnings of the amalgamated lines were divisible amonii a great variety of interests. Any attempt to show that tlie company had made, as the chairman would have them believe, 37 per cent. on their lines he could not but regard as a most andacious attempt upon the credulity of the2 company; for there was no one so ignorant of commercial affairs as not to be aware that his profits depended, not on his gross receipts, but on his net earnings. The speaker then proceeded to read copious extracts from the evidence taken before the Conmmittee of Investigation (already pablished), vith a viCwto showthat the chairman had engaedin stockjobbi22gspeculations which were calculatedtobeseriously detrimental to the interests of the shareholders. For his part, he did not want a stockjobbing chairman; nor did he relieve that it wouild be conducive to their prosperity that their affairs should be committed to the D2anagement of a Eerson enga6ed in any such speculations. (Cheer.) He had read wit equal attention the report of the coulmittee and the reply of Mr. Waddington, and the verdict which, upon his honour as a gentleman, he returned upon the evidence -as, that Sir. *Vaddington was wholly unworthy of the confidence of the company, and that it was im no degree desirable that he should continue to occupy the position of chairman. (Hear, hear.) Air. Toz0R drew attention to the amalgamations of the IEastern Counties Company with the Eastemn Union and the Norfolk Railways, which he contended were fatal under any circumstances to the main line. On such terms had those amalgamations been effectedthatthe isicreaseof ossreecipts afforded no test of prosperity, and that, so far frem increaSing traffic augmenting the dividends of the shareholders, it might, and actually did, diminish them. (Cheers.) He did not blame any individual for those amalgamations; because, although they had been entered into by M1r. Vaddington, it had been done vith the concurrence of thedirect(ors, and the shareholders had sanctioned and approv-ed the.ni As an instance of the effect of the arrangenments 'with the two lines in question, he alluded to the effect upon the comuany:s net receipts from a large coal and cattle traffic. Suppose that traffic were carried on at a profit of 20 per cent., the bargain with those companies gave to the Eastern Counties only 4G per cent. for their expendittre, instead of SO or 90; i.;d they were obliged to pay to the Norfolk and Eastern Union just as mnch as if they had made 54 per cent. profit, although they were not making more than 20. He said n1othing ag-ainst those companies; but the fact was that the Eastern Connties hadmadearninously badbarain. (Cheers,) He eould be the last man to proposejrepudiation of any decription; hut he believed that it was perfectly ssible to naodify that bargain without much trouble. In fact it appeared to hin to be nothing but plain and straightforward work to do so; for the act of Parliament wlhich Sanctioned the agreement not only gave them the riglit, but imposed upon them the duty of makimg the amalgamation complete, so that there should be no conIietiDsg interests whatever among the shareholders; but that they should be all united-the stock of the other lines cOUnting as so many Eastern Connties shares, and their interests bela' identical. The hr er was proceediung to dwellufntih iarrad'entents wit6tihe East Suffolkandwith the We and Fakenarn lines when the meeting became excessively turbulent and impatient, and in spite of a long protracted persistency oe the part of Mr. Tozer, he was at length compelled, inthe niversal nproar, to resumehis seat, and to make way for MIr, NOBBIS (a member of the committee), wio, aftera few introductory remarks, observed that at the period of the appointment of the committee upon the 31st of August Mr. Uoodson held but a small stake in the concern. He continued to be a very small holder until the committee had made their inquiry, and had published the evidence which they had taken, and then Mr. Goodson because the large shareholder which he had boasted of being that day. He took it to be a practical testimony- in favour of the exertions of -the committee, and of the course of proceeding which they had adopted, that Mr. Goodson had greatly increased his holding since the appointment of that coramittee. Prenvous to the appointment of the committee evidence was in existence that gross frauds had been committed, and that they had been defended by the governing body to such an eXtent as ahnost to amount to a guilty par ticipation; the permanent way was known to be in such a con ition as to require an enormous outlay to set it right; and the cLairman was in a state of mental paralysis witbhout the means of explanation. Then it was that he (Mr. Nlorris) proposed the appointment of a Committee of Investii,ation. Gentlemen were appointed who were unknown to each other; the chairman suggested that Mr. Goodion should be added to the hst, a proposition to which neitlher he (Mr. Norris) nor Mr. Goodson at the time objected. But before the committee amet SIr. Goodsor. had changed his mind, and he declined to join in the labours wh ich they had undertaken. That gentleman did not want to be instructed or to get information, or to know the truth of the alleg"ations which had been made, or to probe to the bottom the statements which had gone abroad; hut as soon as the la'cours of the committee had resulted in the mass of eidence which was before the shareholders he became at once alive and zealously active to serve his friend, and out came the requsition, headed by D Goodson d some 12 20a: others with whonj he vsi concert calling the present meeting; and calling it for what? Not for the purpose of rescuing a damagedyproperty and an insulted proprietary from the state to which they had been reduced, nut to ' consider the position of the board of dirctors." (Groans, and indignant demonstrations of various deserip. tions.)Why,importantasthepositionoftheboardofdirectors iBight be to them individually, itwas of noconse-ueneewhat ever as compared with the due administration o atirs of the company, and the safety of the public travelling over theirlhe. (Cheers.) He said, therefore, that thegentlesnan who had refused)to serve the shareholders upon the Committee of Investgaton, after he had been appointed uponI it, ought to have no influence in such an asembly as the present. (Cheers.) Having in 1851proposedthatMr Waddington should be reappointed chairman of the com pany, he (Mr. Norris) declared that he entered upon the committee with considerable predilections in his favour. He went into it with a determination to do bin ample, honest, and clean-handed jnstice. He was bond now, however, as an honest and upright man, to state before that assembly that. he entertained no longer those ipredilections in favour o1 the chairman, and that in opinmon he ought nos lorger to ocupy that position.

However suce cessful inch a course might be as a strokce of policy for grentlemen who were desirous to sit in Parliament, he apprehended that the shareholders of the Eastern Counties ailway Company would peremptorily and unhesitatingly decide that it was in direc contravention of their interests. (Cheers.) These things ipressed him (Mr. Norris) with the belief that the very amosphere of oficial life wToas cal culated to blunt those nice sensibilities bynwhich men usualy divined what belonged to other people and what belon ed to themselves. (Great applause.) It appeared to him Mtha there was a contairons immorality, and that there was no rfet.1ore prprieorshut in figh lt, or in the expulsion tho engaged in those fantastic miasures. He would now briefly advert to the important o lmesa tion of the permanent way. Mr. Ashcroft told ther in 1851 that 901. per mile should be set aside for makwing good dilapidations in the permanent way. For no Ion eriod, however, than up to August, 1852, had that hreeha dcone, and it had been iven up under the advice of the chairman. In February, 1852, the chairmnan, after a lon explanation about "1fish-jointed"' rails, said, "It is clea' to 3my amind that so far as the Easte n Counties line is comceriedthe prvvhinciple ofd ao, depreciation f is wrong. wouwll haveyourline keptinan efficietstate of hmaintenance; andeldio notsee, therpore, biwby you should set asideo a specificysumtof moaneyn fo thatpurse.

They told me nothing of all that; but after they had been sitting for upw;ards of twvo monthSs they catled upon me, for the first time, to givo evidence, aba the only information which I had then received a from witnesses who had been before them, who tOld mo that the tendency of all their questions was to implicate the chaiuman. When I went before the commnittee, having been but a short time in the room, and not knowing what a single witness had stated in evidence except from common runour, I was told by Mr. Ball that if the evidence which I had given was true that given by sny colleages was untrue. Feeling, from the first, that there was something beyond that committee, that a report was to proceed from them, and that an answer must be given, 1I`was naturaly cautious* and the more so when I perceived and was informed that the counrse of their examination was not calculated to protect the property of the shareholders, but that its whole object and purpose wms to prove that I myself had mismuanged the affaurs of the company. (Cheers, uproar, and a cry of " So you have 1") This, then, made me extremely cautious in the answers which I gave, and they were not, therefore, so copious as they would have been if the committeo had examined me in that fair spirit which I had a right to expect, and had ven me an oppoatmnity of bringing documentary evidence or te ose of showing what was thetrue bearing of the case. To illustrate the mode in which they proceeded, I may mention that a question was asked me wvth reference to the permanent way, and I said that I would bring them documents to show how the matter stood. When I returned the committee said that they had altered their queston in my absence; in fact, they had put it in an ent erent shape, and the consequence was that my documents were of noavaiL ('Oh I" anduproar.

He says that in 1851 Mr. Ashcroft recommended that 901. per mile should be set aside as a depreciation fund; the fact being that what Mr. Ashcroft recommended was that tho difference between the actual cost of maintaining the way and 90g. a-mile sliould go towards a depeeaon fund.; e NORRIS.-I fu said, "maintenance of wvy." The CRmua.-Well, I mean that too. We mean the same thing. The fact was, that Mr. Ashcroft'recoramended the 901 per mile, just as I have stated in my reply. As I have also stated in my reply, that reserve ansount was discontinued likewise on tho suggestion of Mr. Ashcroft, and it was not until after several months' con sideration that the directors came to a determination on the subject. But I have dealt with all these matters before, and I shall now allude briefly towhat has occurred to-day. Mr. Norris thinks it con- sistent with that spirit of fair dealing which he claims for i himself to say that we have become cab proprietors, add- I ing, "If youwantto hire acab theywiUlet it outto you, but if you want a job you onust apply to the chairman." (Laughter and applause.) If there is one man in this room whom I would put into the witness-box to prove that I am incapiable of a job, that man shoutld be Mv, Mr. Norris himself. ("Oh I") Mr. Morris has stated that there has been great laxity in the matter of stores. That has been all fully explained; but, I ask, is thero a merchant in this room, with a large establishment, who, on finding that a servant had misconducted himself, would at once break up that establishment, instead of getting rid of the erring servant, or placing upon him such restraints as would prevent future misbehaviour? To take the latter course in such a concern as this would, I think, I be far preferable to constantly harassing the proprietary about this store question with the view of keeping up an agitation for an object which is no+, perhaps, sd5lcienUtly explained. It has only been proved that you have purchased from two firms, and against those two you have commenced proceedings for recovery. [A Voice.-"The committee are doing that."] Mr. Brace has moved, -"That this meeting do confirm the resolution of the general meeting of the 31st of August last, appointing the Committee of Investigation, and that they he requested to continue their labours till the 29th of Eebmnary." Now, just let us see the mischief which this Comsitte of Investigation has already committed. (" Oh !" and cheers.) In the first instance, instead of urging upon MIr. Brnff, as you w ould suppose they would have done, the necessity of repairing the hne, they question him, and place obst:acles in hi way on account of the large e.xpenditure incurred. (Cries of "No, no.") I have that ucon the statement of Mr. Bruff himself. (A Voice,- It is not true.") Mr. Bruff told me that not only was such the fact, but that he had been before the Permainent Way Committee to ask them what he was to do in consequence of the course that was being taken by the Committee of Investivation. Such was the treatment accorded to Mr. Bruff, who had called the attention of the directors in the first instance to the permanent way, who had stated vhat would be the cost of putting it in efficient repair, who had suggested whether it would not be desirable to distribute the outlay over a certain number of years, and who had pointed out all that was necessary to be done upon tho subject. (Cheers.) So much with regard to that great bugbear-the permanent way-all danger withrespect to which Mr. Bruff informs me is past. The board of directors were quietly t repairing the way; they were not alarming the public mind, but they were repairing it for tho purpose of preventing alarrm- The Committee of Investigation, however, directed the attention of the public to it by a statement which is, to sAy the least of it, exaggerated, and alarming in the highest degree. (Cheers.) Wahat further has that com- ! niitlee done? Enoving that we, likle other railway companies, are in the mar et borrowing money, they, having access to the, documents of the Eastern Counties Board have, through an active partisan, M1r. Pulley, issued a statement in that Conservative feeling which would lead you, I suppose, to imagine that they want to preserve, instead of tryng to uproot and destroy. That committee, through Mr. Pulley, who has been in constant communication with them, state, for the purpose of making a poit, that you are borrowing money at the rate of 61 per cent. ; and, in order to give it a "' clincher," they repeat the assertion in their report. I ask why did they not state the whole facts ? Why did they not state that your deputy-chairman t (M1r. Brace) had neglected to borrow money until he was obliged to go to the lUnion Bank to ask them to give yon a temporary loan? Why did they not tell yon that it was ? mere temporary loan, made through your bankers, and that the Eastern Counties ought to Le in a position, from its revenue and receipts, to borrow money on terms as favourable as other companies, instead of, by their acts, statements, and reports, endeavouring to depreciate the value of your ptroperty ? (Cheers.) They ought to have said that th at was a temporary loan, that these were difficalties which must pass away, and that the property should be looked upon, as I am sure it will, hereaFter be regarded, as possessing large resources, capable of great expansion. (A oice.-' Not while you are there.") Your coal contracts will expire in Mlay, 1856. By means of them a large trafflo has been developed, but in future you will be able, owing to your past operations, to obtain much higherratesandamuchlargerrevenue. (Cheers.) But, as regards your permanent way, if you had adopted the principle of distributing the outlay over 10 or 15 years, as was proposed, and as is done by some of the largest companies in the kingdom, you would have created no feeling of alarm, you would not have agitated the public mind, and there would have been no indisposition to travel on your line; but your traffic, -which has increased,would have increased in: a much greater proportion, and your receipts, which are la~rger, would have become larger stilL (Cheers, confusion, and cries of " Oh P') If they had told you all this, they would onIyhave told yon that which you were entitled to receive-at their hands. But I say further, that if I hadnot come forward ("Oh! oh T') and given to youthat truthful, honest, and full statemeent of affairs wlhich I have given to you ("Oh, ohl") your property might, in the words of Mr. Xorris, have been "jobbed, 'and you would have been sacrificed. It is because I have been identified so fully with your policy, it is because that career, although now obscured by a temporary cloud, has been attended with such beneficial results, that those who have different interests to serve have availed themselves of this opportunity to destroy your property. (Cheers, groans, and hisses. Fmding that they had no case against me, Mr. Morris, who tells you that in 1851 he- vwas the means of bringing me back to this company, and who, therefore, must have felt that there was nothing wrong in my conduct, wishes to niix me up with one who, whatever may have been his faults, has nothing whatever to dowith the questionbeforethis meeting, (Groans and cheers.) Findirg that their case was weak,theythought to strengthenitfromextraneous sources, for they felt that in their weakness they could only be upheld by the prejudice which they sought to crtate. Bet for. tified by the thonghtfulshareholdersatadistance, andby that calm consideration which I trust will prevail when you come to give your votes, IHfeel convinced that this Committee of Investigation will be consigned to the sphere from which they issued-bthe management of their own private affairs and that the public will say, "H llowever carefuly you may look aifter sucl concerns, however wisely you .may conduct them, you have given the Eastern Counties Company such ataste of the perverse modc in which you manage an important public inquiry affecting millions of property that, whatever faith your own friends may have imyon, you cease as public men to be entitled to our confidence, and we cannot permit youtointerferefuther in our affairs." (Iond cheers, mingled with groans and hisses.) MEr. Lovsx offered afew words in explanation; but the: meeting was now in such a state of excitement and exhaustion that it would not give a hearing to any speaker, and nothingthat the hon. gentlemansaid w-as audible to onr rep,orters. The C nw,RI then put the amendment, when not more than 30 or 40 hands 'were raised in its favour, the vast maajority of the meeting voting in the negative.

GREAT WESTERY RALWAY. TO THE EDITOB OF THE TEES Sir,-Your able correspondent "Investizator' hardly sustains the character his assumed name confers upon him. He still persists in his extraordinary error of imagining that thenrrowgauge, comingsouthfromOxford, stopsatPleading. Lethiinbe informed that it is laid to Basingstoko, and, when connected (as it will be very shortly) with the SouthWestern, forms an nnbroken comamunication between Liverpool and Sonthampton. Iet "Investigator" take Bradshar's Map, and putting his penoil at Harlech, north of Cardigan Bay, drevr a straight line to Chester, then another line midv-ay between the Great Western and the l,ondon and NWorth-Western to London, and, lastlv another line midway between the Great Western and South Western, passing through Basingstoke to Dorchester, and he will have a very fair representation of the area which naturaly lies underwhat is called the broad-gauge districtan area embracing upwards of 21,000 square miles-or, even supposing " Investigator" will not allow that the " influence" he so strongly deprecates is co-extensive with the " Shrewsburys," but mnst stop at Wolverhampton, the extreme north of the offendin gauge, let him take his pencil and draw a line across WaRIes, from Cardigan to Woiver hampton, anad he will still have 18,000 square miles within the pale of that so-called " magnificent blunder," the broad gauge. INow, then, with the help of a httle of that " common sense" (which has given such apparent point to your c7orrespondent's prophecies), let us investigate the "commuercial q~uestion, ' so " sacrificed to personal prejudices and false- notions of railway economy." Common sense would dictate that the South of Wales is the steam-coal-producing country, London and the south ports being its markets; that to alter or mix parts of the intervening gauge now between those points would only involve confusion. Common sense says, now that one-fourh of England and Wales is interlaced with boad gauge, it would be a " commercial absurdity" to incur the enormous outlay requisite to convert the permanent way and rolling stock into narrow ga ; and that it is not because the broad-gauge district has happened from necessity to have one of its corners intersected by a north and south narrow-gauge route, rid Basingstoke, that there must also be a bit of narrow laid, from Reading to London, just to satisfy the incursive spirit of some -who have grown notorious for their defiance alike of Chancery and Parliamentary obligatious. Let the broad-gauge shareholders see, that in the extensive district they possess, they may soon, by careful worldng, reap a good reward out of their fast increasing revenue, and let them repel with indignation that sort of jobbery which would aim at a third line from Birmingham to London, and so rob them of their only chance of a reasonable dividend, I say, let broad-gauge shareholders see that it is notthe gauge but the management which brings them returnmfor thneir money. L,et them take for instanceazood narrow sue tbrouh communication, like the MancEester, Shefenla,sd ,ncolnsbsre, connecting two opposite armns,of the sea.

I USMSSA AYD IrORWA9Y AND MSWDE2'. TO TEC EDITORE OF THE T1S -F.S. Sir,-As some misapprehension osems to exist concerniF theexactobject of Russianamabition In the north of Xorwvjo -a misapprehension on the part of tie Constihtfonnct of which the Kord has t_ken advantage-1 may per,haps be allowed a little space in your columns to state the rmult -of my owl observations and inquiries on the ppot during a couple ! rnonths last spring and summer, in vIdch tine I visited allnmost every corner of the Varanger Fiord. The entrance of the fiord may hD considered to be a line drawn from MibergNess in Norway to the headlani-called by the Norwegians marlsganmen, in Russi. Betweena these two points is a distance of upwards of 20 EngL mies, deep -ter all the way; and this is the entrance which, accordaig to the NoVrd, is conimanded by the Nor.. wegisn fort of Vardo-huus This fort lies quite out of the entrance and not even opposite to it, being several miles to the north. Deficient as ' the isind on which it stands is in good harbo, it could never be of much use in watching, much less iti "ommanding," Taranger Fiord, even supposing the folt itself tobecapableofbeingraised beyond its present very humble pretensiors. Varanger Fiord gradually contracts as it runs westwa4, and, for a general decriptionr, may be said to be bounded by 3 north and a south eoast. The north coast is low and contains no hzrbouiN except the shallow and very in- different one of Vadso The south coast, on the otherhand,is very high land, ard fran al distance appears to be a continned ridge of momntain, but, on approaching nearer to it, it is found to be indented by several creeks, which pene., trate far into the land. About a third of this south coas' of the fiord, from Earlsg ae (which itself is low land) to the little stream caoled Jacob's _Eiver, already belongs to Russia, bet it contains no, gooa harbouTs, though, probbly, quite sucidently good ones for any Finnish produce that wo;ld ever find its way there. The reaining part of this south coast belongs to Norwy, and it seems to have been the Russian " Eldorado," rather than Hammerfest, which-is far beyond the tract of territoryRu&sa proposed in the first instance to acquire in esxchange. Iu this part of the south coaot of the 'VaraDger are sevm - ral excellent harbours, not at present ever used for shipping, but in the opinion of competent persoms admirably adapted for it. The principal of these lie about the inlets calei Bog Fiord and Bugoe iord, whirit, after running some dis. tance inland, meet together and muLke an iland of the inter. -vening coast. This iland is called S9agere The eastem paTt of Skageroe surrounds a remwrkable herbour. It is w.ell sheltered, roomy, hasa good bottom, and the water, branching into convenient creeks, is of the mo,4 accomino. datmng depth. It is -nspproacable from behind, and on; the sea side there are several low islets, exactly suited for the erection of protecting forts. Aharborur a Ifttle to the west., which has been talLed ao bautd. calels Bm-Un, but it is too small, and the water too dew f br the requirec object. Next the Neord requests the ConstutionweFtc look1 at the map to be cousineed that the Varanger Fiord is " at a con. siderable distance from that fortbnnte Eldonjo of the Norwegian coast where the water is never frozen." The Nord knows that it speaL-s literal truth in implying that in the V garaner the waters are occasionally frozen, but it keeps in the backgrounad te fact that itis only se ia those creeks which both run far inland and have a, oertair admix tare of fiesh water. The inmost part of the Varanger, culled MosaIc Fiord, was only clear of ice a few days, before I isised it in the middle of lay. But it- is not so vith the harbour I have descrbed in Skageroc, thougli.tbe deep ana narrow fiords running inland behindi it- ar- frosen every winter.

LONDON, SATURDAY, JANUARY 26, 186. The announcement of peace, received with so much pleasure in almost all the capitals of Europe, has, we fear, been heard with little gratification or applause by the citizens of Turin. The causes of jealousy andr mutual distrust wvhich have so long ranlded in the breasts of Sardinian and Austrian statesmen must produce a great divergence between the views entertainea of the present conjuncture by Piedmont and her allies in the'conflict. To us Austria is a country of which we have no jealousy. Her institutions are not our institutions, nor her principles such as we are in the habit of professing, but still we regard these mattersa with toleration, if not with' indifference, and are well content that she should manage her own affairs in her own' wvay,, without any desire on' our part to interfere withl them. But with Piedmont the case is,very different. It is only eight years' ago that the two countries met face to face in long and sanguinary e6balat, ana, though Austria used her victory with moderation, the scars are not yet healed which that war inflicted. It is therefore natural the intelligence -that 'Austria has achieved a sliecies of 'diplomatic triumph, and is likely to exercise no inconsi:derable influence at the coming conferences, should grate harshly on the ears of Piedmont, and that 'he should dread the ascendancy acquired for the; moment by a Power frowm whose goodwilI she deems that she has very little to expect. Nfeither can it be denied that the abrupt, we might almost say the premature termination of 'the struggle, must be a bitter disappointment to a State which believed, and probably with justice, that it lad everything to gain by the continuance of hos- tilities. Piedmont has ventured boldly and fairly' in the present struggle; she has played her little stake without shrinking fromn the consequences, and has thus given England reason to be proud. of her convert, and 'Italy of -a nation which leads the van in 'that path of glory in which it would be tha: mfety ana thEe happiness of the inhabitants, of that oppressed peninsula to follow. But Piedmont,nio doubt,' anticipated that in the course -f the nighty chaiges whichthii war was-liiely tolzming about something more than mere barren approbation-i something better, or at least more substantial than glory, would fall to her share. Nor was the hope unreasonable. E1iery one' must see that, had the conflict been protracted but a few months longer, the flames of war would have enveloped every country from the Baltic to the MIediterranean. Li,Le the Red Republican and ufltra-Socialist parties, the ihture hopes of Piedmont are much mixed up with war iand confusion, but for very different reasons. M3xzm and Litunx RoarN may hope, amid the ruin of society and the downfall of opu. lence and industry, to find their opportunity for forcing on startled and terlified communities the wild doctrines in which they believe they have found the secret of social regeneration. Piedmont, oni the other hand, hopes-and assuredly not without reason-that, amnid the uprooting of ancient systems and the overthrow of worn-out dynasties, the noble example she has set of the union of liberty and order might make her the protectress, as she has long been the asy- lum, of Italian freedom, and increase her narrow. territories to a magnitude more commensurate with the liberality of her principles and the justice and moderation of her Government. All these hopes hare been nipped in the bud, and we cannot wonder that Piedmont should feel some mortification at the sudden dissipation of so many wellfounded hopes and the disappointment of so many plans of future aggrandizement. Still, though her finances have tndoubtedly been heavily burdened by the war, and though her troops have suffered severely by the ravages oF disease and somewhat from the part they took in the glorious victory of the Tchernaya, there is no reason for Piedmont to abe4.e one jot of -lieart or hope, or to desponid and turn back in the noble career which she has set before her. She has not, indeed, been destined to achieve success in 'a monment, as a reward of the wise and liberal policy she has adopted, and the opening which the war seeraed to offer to her aspirations bas failed to present the occasion for which she sought. But such is ever the course of human affairs. There is'a strong and irresistible tendency in xight to triumpph ovet wrong-in wisdom and moderation to assert tneir superiority over folly and violence. But tlhe course of these compensating and redressing 'operations is slow and gradual, and neither nations nor men mnust expect to reap altogether as they have sown. Of this the Sardinian nation may be satisfied-that, if it has not gained aUl that it hoped, its participation in this war has been neither inglorious nior unfruitful. At the present day, when the most powerful nations are compelled to submit to Governments on sufferance because they can find nothing on which they can anchor their confidence-no man and no institution worthy of their affection or esteem,-Sardinia has shown to the world how liberty and order may be conciliated, the freedomn of conscience, of speech, and of writing may be vindicated, with an entire avoidance of tumult or anarchy. Sardinia has deserved well both of England and France by the moral as well as the material support she has afforded them, and England and Prance would act both unworthily and ungratefully if they forgot for a moment the benefits they have received fromr her. She has won the esteem and the confidence of Italy, and annihilated by the force of her example and the attraction of her institutions the miserable factions that have so long been seeldng to plunge the peninsula into anarchy, merely, as it should seem, that, exhausted by her own violence, she might fall back into the arms of despotism. Rome is no longer the holy city of Italy-it is towards Turin that the aspirations of the good, the wise, ana the free among her people are directed; she is the city of refuge to the oppressed, the pattern and archetype of what a regenerated Italy should and may one day become. Nobody can doubt that Sardinia occupies a mioral position such as it is seldom granted to any kingdom, small or large, to possess. As little can it be questioned that, with the support of England and France, and with her own military and naval resources, she has nothing to fear from external violence. To have conquered such a position is in itself an enormous triumph, and a nation that has achieved such a success may well wait in dignity and tranquility till the moment shall arrive, as sooner or later it will arrive, when she shall reap in a vast accession of power and importance the well-merited reward of so many virtues and so many sacrifices. It could not be for a moment suspected that England and France should continue the war after its main objects had been satisfied by the submission of Russia for the sake of the collateral benefits which its prosecution might offer to an ally; as little can it be expected that in the negotiations which are about to take place, or in the subsequent course of European affairs, England and France should show themselves unmindfui of the assistance which Piedmnont lent them in their hour of need.
The present state of political feeling in England is not unworthy of inquiry. It is continually said that party is extinct, and each man explains the fact according to his own views. One who maLes pretence to philosophical insight will say that there are blindness and confusion because men are not well instructed, and have vain longings for they kmow not what, so that Tories rush into enthusiastic liberalism, and disappointed Utopians shrink back into conservative caution. The moralist of an old school exDlains everything by the decay of sound principles; expediency, according to him, governs all the actions of this generation, and he looks with equal distrust on the leaders of his own party and that opposed to him. Yet all allow the fact that broad distinctions of opinion are no more. We may go so far as to say that in the present day nearly every man of sense is of the same politics. Opinions are moderate, and men are not even as @trene as their opinions. Without incurring the charge of optimism, it may be allowed to a thinkm*g Englishnan to rejoice at this condition of things. There is less difference becaulse there is niore discussion.. Men's minds are all similarly constituted,' and, when they impaitially examine, their conclusions ivili naturally tend to similarity. It may be said, too, that the identity of political sentiment in England has been hastened by the destruction of monopolies, privileges, and indefensible abuses. After all, the old parties represented the interests of classes, and only set up' opinions because it was necessaryr to have aIome conventional topics of discussion. The reign of equal rights has begun, and each man, finding he has nothing to gan by illegitirate means, naturally endeavours to advance the pubtlic good,'which le sees also to be his own. Some years since the Universities represented an unniistakable'politicalcreed. Oxford, more especilly, was supposed to fashion every mind within its influence according to ai certain type. - Cam. b4idgo had, it is dificult to say on what grounds the reputation of being somewhat more open to liberal ideas. But, on the wv-ole, the- Universities were high Tory constituencies, abhorring fancheater ancd abhorred in turn. . Cambridge dismiussed both her representatives for supporting the 1eform Will. Oxford had before done stern justice on the supposed betrayer of the.church.. Th'u, f*o men who have both EInce that time been at the head of their country's Government, and have earned the highest place in modern Englixh statesmanship, were cast out by constituencieswhich admired them simply because they no longer held stanchly certain 'well-defined opinions. Since those days what a change hax been vrought ! Oxford has abandoned the im'ni. bility, which she'at length felt to be torpor, and hw passed from one extreme to another of religious and political thought. Mr. GLADSTONS- represents, if anything, the unfixedness of the present Oxonian mind. Cambridge, wor3dng out her improved sys- tem of scientific education, has tacitly acquiesced. in what are caUled progress and enlarged -views. The representative whose death gives nse to the present contest retained his seat to the last; yet, in the language of Toryism, he might be described as having followed the maxims of expediency until they led him into a great and open apostacy. M1r. Gouxnumf was Chancellor of the ]Exchequer lnder Sir ROBERT PEEL; he went with him in hls lapse from the old principles; he assented to the repeal of the Corn Laws, and argued for the new policy as long as it was assailed. Yet he was re-elected, evenwhen the animosities kindled bythe conflict were at their height. It cannot be doubted thatlMr. GouLSumri, the liberalized politician, the mipporter of Whigs and Coalitionists, represented something in Cambridge which had nio existence 20 years before. It may be urged that the tTniversity retained MIr. Gon;uarN in his seat because it was accustomed to him and respected him personally. Such a feeling may doubtless have had weight, but we cannot but feel that Cambridge really meant to express an intelligent adherence to the new doetrintes which he and his colleagues had adopted; at least, the University would not decisively and acrimoniously pronounce agaimst them by such a step as the banishment of a representative. Before the present vacancy took place it may be said, therefore, that each University had at least one member who might on most subjects be called a Liberal. This recession of the Universities fiom the old Tory character makes the present contest for Cambridge less important, brut not less interesting. Two candidates are in the field, one of whora may be styled a Liberal Conservative, while the other actually calls himself a Conservative Liberal. It is easy to see that on a great utruiber of questions their opinions and votes would 'be the same. MIr. WAwoxx will probably not feel himlself bound by any formula of 1852. No man .ambitioas of distinction can now venture to propitiate a party or profession by the siuicidal consistency of clinging to names ancd watchwords when realities are no more. Should both the candidates hereafter sit in Parlianrent, the impulsive liberalty of the born Cowservative may sometimes outstrip the steady pace of the hereditary WVhig. Yet we are bound to accept Mr. WALroLE and hMr. DEb-fl according to their professions and antecedents. One represents the Conservative, the other the Liberal sentiment in the University, though the two forms of opinion are divided by no definite bouncd, and gradually merge into each other. The return of MIr. Dxursro, it seens to us, depends on the growth and vitality of the feeling which replaced Mr. GovrLumx in 1847. Has Cambridge become more Liberal daing the last eight years ? The steady ninority which has always held fast to popular doctrines will, no doubt, be active, and rr. DzNin- will count among his supporters some of the most eminent names of this country. On the other hand, a large section wIl vindicate its consistency and its attachment for what it considers the constitution. On the floating mass between these two solid bodies deponds the fate of the election. Now, if the common Cambridge feeling be in favour of the politics, and not merely the person of the late member, then M1r. DErN'mA has a very fair chance. He seems to represent as nearly as possible the opinions of Air. GOUnnvnK during the last 10 years of his career. HIe professes himself a sincere member of the Church of Engeland, and considers it an important function of the University to educate both clergy and laity in religious matters. He will aid in all measures for enabling the University to carry out reforms, but he is attached to the present system of independent colleges, and is averse from any unnecessary external controL Iadeed, unless a candidate were fully determined to uphold all that distinguishes the Universities, it would be useless and even reprehensible for him to seek to represent them. A constituency of which twothirds are clergymen must be expected to demand a man whose opinions on church subjects are clearly mnown. Mr. Goustuu- was an Ecclesiastical Commissioner, and we may beheve that Mr. D&a-'3w is as desirous to remove as quicldy as may be the remaining blemishes of the Church, without destroying her independence or weakening her authority. Neither candidate is sparing of blandishments to the learned, but somewhat impulsive, constituency. Each seems to attenuate his distinguishing characteristics in order to gain the votes of a body which is supposed to be 'wavering. The Tory is not quite a Tory, and the Whig not so very igifshh. However, the more Conservative candidate has probably the greater number of stanch supporters, and the middle party must declare in mass for Mr. DzrN-at if it would see hina its representative. Although we cannot believe that the result of the election will be of much mnoment either way, its course is certainly deserving of attention, and to those acquainted with the 7Universities full of interest. We may congratulate Cambridge on the fact that, in whichever way the contest be decided, she will be at least fitly represented. Both candidates are most respectable men, and we should hardly be sorry to see the two seats for the University filled by them. In the present day the Universities cannot afford to send infeiior men to Parliament. A member who is, or ought to be, speechless, is to fit deputy for these great corporations, with their privileges and prestige, their power in the State, and the animosity which continually threatena them, not whollywithout fault on their part.
We should think that no single column in. our paper ever comprehended so great a variety of ideas, of institutions, and, of modes of action and thought of professions, as the report that appeared yesterday of a hearing in the Court of Queen's Bench, headed " The Quxm v. the Archbishop " of C0ssiraxeiy." Seldom have we felt so utter a sense of the hopeless entanglement in whiefi Church and State have involved one another as on rising from the pergsal of that colun7. Here is the Case, if indeed it is possible to state a ease which seems to elude the grsp of lawyets, divines, and everybody who tries to handle it :-It appears that two or three years ago Arhieacon ])mmisoK preached or published a sermon containing a certain sacramental theory, founded, -w believes on te literal sense of the words of institution. As the Archdeacon is quite as wrm in his reprobation of Romanigt doctrines as -we oDuld possbly be, it is unnecessay to say that his iem are guarded against that extreme. The greatbody of English. divines, holding neither that extreme nor the other, and not being over-anxious to dogmatize where they had so nuch to do in- e- nouncing dogmas, have been content to leave the myatery in its own mysteriousness. The rchndeicon, however, seems not to be so satisfied, sad
W;nat is to become of Smithfield? Hitherto allotted to a thousand improper uses,-the burning of witches, the burning of martyrs, the gathering of rebel armies, the gathering of fatted oxen, the Wale of cattle, the sale of wives,-it seems to have been the Aceldama of London, the field of blood; and, if we cannot all at once determine what it shall be for the future, we can, at all events, determine what it shall not be. It shall not be the field of death and animal decay any more. The live-cattle market was bad enough; the dead-meat market, which it has been proposed to establish instead, is still worse. It would entail all the evils of the previous state of things, uith other nuisances in addition. Everybody has heard of the old Sibyl who came to the Roman King with nine volumes, for which she asked a very high-' price, 'and who askea the very same price for six of them,-and for three of them, after she haa'burnt the others. Certain 'of our city authorities are liLb that unreasonable 'old woman in the audacity of' their- demands, although we hope they will not be so successful with the Eo= SicurAny as ise was' with King TAaqvw. First of all they insisted on retaining the cattle market at Smithfield, which, so far from being a nuisance in their eyes, was a positive blessing, a rare beauty, a highly poetidal remniniscence of the country,suggestiveof shepherds'shepherdesses, pipes,'crooks, and eclogues. The nuisance has, happily, been swept away, but instead of gracefully yielding they now want to double it. The cattle, according to this proposal, are still to be driven through narrow and crowded streets to Smaithfield, dogs barking them on, and men twisting and breaking the tails of the poor brutes; but they are not to be driven there to be dispersed again; they are to be slaughtered on the spot.' The place is to enjoy atl the pleasant odours, the lovely sights, and the joyful sounds, all the balmy inhalations and invigorating influence of an abattoir, while the dead careswes may hang on the hooks till it shall be convenient for the public to buy theni, and the hideous offal may lie in 'the sawdust until it shall be convenient for the butchers to remove it. Those who have a special interest in the Smithfield property might surely be a little more modest in their demands-might surely show some little consideration for the neighbouring hospital-might surely have the common sense to see that the anthorities who exorcised the old devil of the market, and dissipated the old nuisance, wiU not so frustrate their work as to allow seven other demons worse than before, and a nuisance still more abominable, to take the place of it. It was obviously the intention of the act which abolished Smithfield to establish the dead-meat market contiguousto the cattle market, andabattoirs inconnexion with both. One of the principal objects, indeed, of the new market in Copenhagen-fields was to do away entirely with the practice of slaughtering within the town, and this for the double reason that the driving of the beasts through the streets is both dangerous and inconvenient, and that the slaughter-houses themselves are a pest. How have the city authorities managed ? In the first place, the lairs for the cattle and pens for the sheep in the new market' are anything but convenient, and others are used. In the next place, only a few slaughter-houses have been built in the new market, obviously to preserve the existing ones and all the offensive trades that belong to them; hence more driving, cruelty, danger, trouble, expense. Would it not be infinitely wiser, seeing that there is ample space for any number of abattoirsand a fine dead-meat market in Copenhagen-fields, to erect these on a suitable scale, all three together, instead of spending enormous sums in building palatial taverns,, the rent of which must be nuinous? Were the city authorities to do their duty in this respect, where would be the use of a dead-meat market in Smithfieldc? It will be remembered, perhaps, that one of thle arguments used against the removal of the cattle market from that quarter was its contiguity to Newgate-market. Why is this argument forgotten now that the former is removed to 'Copenhagen-fields, and we are threatened with another dead-meat market? Tlhat Smithfield will ever be turned to this use, we have no fear; we only wish that the authorities would go a step or two further, and deal with Newgate-market, at once abolishing the slaughter-houses in its neighbourhood.' The iarket itself might, perhaps, with advantage be stil kept for retail, but the wholesale business should all be transacted at Copenhagen-fields, proper abattoirs being erected there or in the immediate neighbourhood. 'If nuisances have everywhere an amazing vitality, city nuisances are immortal. There is an old saying to the effect that cleanliness is next to godliness. We believe it; and we beleve also that true cleanliness is not more common than pure religion. With regard to the latter, certain sectaries are in the habit of declaring that we are about to lose our religion as a nation-that the moment we completely enfranchise the Jews we shall cease to be a Christian people. The statement has more truth if we invert it, and apply it to our present subject. The neatness and cleanliness of the English in their habits are proverbial; but never until the last few years have we nationally recognized the necessity of this virtue, and a pretty picture the future historian will draw of our dirt and slovenliness, not in our personal, but in our municipal capacity! He will tell of the state of our prisons, and all the abominations that were allowed to collect there, and how long we were in sweeping them away. He will tell of the state of our sewerage,-how many lives were daily lost from the impurities of the dens and alleys of our great cities, and how, year after year, the cholera came and slew its victims, and we took no heed. He wi tell of the squalor of so many emigrant ships, and what frightful fevera used to break out in them. He will tell of- the citizens of London to this very hour drinldng the Thames water, and his imagination will perhaps help him to describe with all possible delicacy the pure sources from which it flows. He will tell of oar city graveyards reeking with the fumes of decomposing matter, the air impregnated with pollution, and a venerable archdeacon sniffing it up like a Sabwarn odour, and telling his parishioners that it is life. He wil tell of immense herds of cattle housed in the densest part of our city, while he will compare the practice with the free and easy habit of the Idsh, who sleep, and eat, and live in the same hovel with their pig and all her little ones. He will tell of the cattle driven through our streets, and ask whether we are more fastidious in our associations than the mountaineer of the pampas, who cuts the steak living from the buffalo, and cooks it by placing it on his saddle and riding hard upon it for. a dozen miles. He will tell of a dead-meat market in the heart of our cities, and wonder, perhaps, that we did not convert our drAwingrooms into larders, with, legs of mutton and haunches of venison hanging from the ceiling, lke hams in the kitchen. We have much' to learn, but we believe that the city authorities are more alive than they used to be to sanitary considerations, and are not without hope that they wil soon be brought to understand that the health and comfort of the whole comraunity are more to be valued than the convenience of the few who are interested in Smithfield and Newgate-market. -_-
We have great satisfaction in announcing that Sir -. Grey has advised Her 3Iajesty to remit the remainder of the sentence of 12 montha' imprisonment passed by Mr. Wfilson Overend upon 3Ix. Jackson, of Doncaster. In so doing, Sir G. Grey does not enter into the question of the innocence or guilt of theoprisoner, but reverses the judg,ment of Mr. Overend upon the ground that the prisoner had sot sufflcient time and opportunity allowed him. for preparng his defence. We trust that Mr. Wilson Overend will take the hint thns conveyed, and retire from a sphere of action forwhich heseems qualified neither by temper nor education. We have reason to believe that, according to the precedents of 181 and 1815, when Lord Castlerea,gh, who was then Foreign Secretary, assisted at the negotiations at Vienna and Paris, Lord Clarendon will represent Great Britain at the Conferences, which will probably be held at Frankfort after the preliminaries of peace are sined. Baron Brunow and Count OrlofE will, it is said, appear on the part of Russia.

INVESTITURE OF THE ORDER OF THE BATH AT PARIS. The Moniteur of yesterday publishes the following - " A most interesting ceremony took place yesterday at the English Embassy. The Order of the Bath was conferrel npon a number of general and saperior officers of the French army, who, in the Eastern war, had deserved that high distinction,which can only be obtained, according tothe statutes of the Order, for eminent services rendered to England. "Generas Bosquet and Regnaud de St. Jean d*Angely received the Grand Cross of the Order; Generals Niel, de Martimprey, Mellinet, Dalesme were appointed Knights Commanders; Generals Espinasse, de Bevile, Cler, Maneque, and Colonels Comignan, de Rochebouet, Reille, and others were appointed Knights Companions. " Conformably to the statutes, the members of the Order present at Paris were assembled; in addition to a number of English General officers, the three Grand Crosses conferred by the Queen's own hand during her visit at Paris,-his Imperial Highness Prince Napoleon, Marshal Valant, and General Canrobert,-were present. " At half-past 6 the ceremony took place with that peculiar pomp attached to the ancient institutions of England, which was heightened still more by the recollection of the recent great acts accomplished, and by the presence of so many illustrious personages, many of whose wounds are not yet healed. All the members already decorated wore tho insignia of the Order. " lord Cowley, tho English Ambassador, having his Imperial Highness Prince Napoleon on his right, performed the act of investiture under a dais surmounted by the arms of the Qneen of England, and wearing the Grand Collar and Cloak of the Order. Having read the different letters patent of the Qaeen, he handed the insignia to each of the new Knights, led up to him by two introducers. His Excellency then made a short speech, recalling the glorious titles the new members of the Order had to the favour of the Queen and to the gratitude of England. Lord Cowley expressed tho pleasure it would have afforded the Queen to have performed the ceremony of investiture in person, and concluded by wishing them, according to custom, a long and prosperous life, which would enable them to enjoy tho honours conferred upon them. I nmediately after the ceremony the banquet-haU was thrown open; places were arranged for al the guests. His Imperial Highness sat opposite the Ambassador, with Lady Cowley on his right hand.- At dessert the Euglish Ambas. sador proposed the 'Health of the Emperor of the French.' "Prince Napoleon replied as folows - I" MyLord and Gentlemen,-Iproposeto you the 'Health of Her Majesty the Queen of England.' In the name of my comrades of the army of the East I thank Her Mfajesty for theihigh distinction which she has deigned to confer upon us; if, in our devotion to the most just of causes, for which we have fought and triumphed, we stood in need of an encouragement and a recompense, we should find them in the striking proof of the favour of an august Sovereign and of the gratitude of a great people our ally. ' In the name of the army, to the Queen of England ! " " Lord Cowley then proposed toasts to the French army and navy, and Count Walewski proposed the 'H ealth of the Army and Navy of England.' " In conclusion, the English Ambassador proposed a fuial toast as most opportune and important in the present state of affairs-a toast to the speedy conclusion of peace, to the legitimate hope which the new negotiations gave to the allies, and in particular to the English people, to see finally a termination of the evils of war,-evils (added his Excel. lency) the full extent of which the illustrious soldiers hero present are able to appreciate, as they were spectators and many of their glorious comrades victims thereof. " Thisflte, so complete, is another link between the two armies and the two people; it is of a nature, from the recollections it will leave among eminent men who have received such high marks of the favour of Queen Victoria, to cement the alliance of the two great Western Powers, upon which the future destiny of the civilized world rests."

FOREIGN INTELLIGEBCE. - -ITALY. (EOM OUR OWN COIESPOsNMNET.1 8 portion of the folowing appeared ia our second edition of vesterdav:-l TURIN, JA-'. 20. The unexpected intelligence promulgated by means of the telegraph within the last two or three days may fairly be said to have electrified the .orld, and caused speculations, both moral and material, on the vital question of peace or wrar, which very naturally supersedes every other topic here, as no doubt it has inmost other parts of Europe. 0n the Bourse the usual effect of such news was imnmediately perceptible; stocksandshares rose, and the price of grain and breadstuffs fell proportionately; ^ but that such fluctuations were merely the result of foreign quotations must be concluded from the very general opinion among commercial classes that peace, though so much desired, is by no means so easy of attainment as the sanguine would believe. To many in Italy, of course, the idea of peace at the present moment is the shipwreck of long-cherished hopes, at least apparently so; thogh, perhaps, as in most other cases, the result may prove the shortsightedness of their own views; therefore, instead of instancing to you the opinions of those who do not wish for peace as an example of public feeling in Italy, I will quote the remarks of journals wrhich must be above all suSpicion of that nature, premising that they are singualrly in accordance wfith the sentiments expressed by their habitual oppo0nents. The papers I allude to are the offlicial Garettes of -Verona and Milian, which, in discussing the substance of the despatches from Vienna and Paris of the last two days, are by no means inclined to place much faith in peace resulting immediately from the present Russian acceptance of thleAustroWestern proposals, as they remind their readers of the unsatisfactory conclusion of similar negotiations last year, and attribute the conciliatory tone of the St. Petersburg Cabinet to the menacing attitude of that of Vienna -now. At the same time the Austrian Charge d'FAffaires at Turin received a despatch from his Government, informng him of the acceptance of the terms by Russia, and authorizing him to communicate the intelligenceto the SardinianMinister for Foreign Affairs, and the Prussian Minister received a like notice from his Government, which he also gave the public the benefit of, with the additional information that it was the Berlin Government which had effected the peace! As I have said, the views of the Veerona and Milan Gazeaes are generally shared bypeople of all political opinions as regards the uncertainty of peace, but as to the credit due to thie VTiennaCabinetforits part in the transactions a very wide difference exists. It can be no secret that the greatest distrust exists in the mind of every Italian, official or unofficial, who has had to do with that Government, and therefore we need not be surprised that suspicion of deceit is the first idea which occurs on hearing of any change of policy at Vienna. These feelings have been engendered by long years of misgovernment, so that, if unjust in the present instance, the Austrian Government has only itself and its hereditary policy to blame for it. As it is, the general belef appears to be here that Austria is still more the friend of Russia than of the Western Powers, to whom she wilL ultimatelyprove faithless. This judgment may seem little worthy of attention to the wise men of the West, coming from an insignificant people without power, but it is a people who have had great experience of the Government in question, and we know that truth comes from the mouths of babes and sucklings. The Lombard Bishops appear determined to put their powers under the new concordat to the proof as soon as possible. They have now addressed a requisition to the Government of Vienna for the reestablishment of the ecclesiastical censorship, finding they could aet no satisfaction from the local Government at RIilan, and in this the best informed persons seem to think they willbe unsuccessful, but that the supreme Government will retain in its own hands the power of confirming or not the clerical denunciations against the press, merely allowing the ecclesiastical authorities to do the jackal's duty. A private letter from Florence says that the Government of Tuscany pursues the clerical and absolutist doctrines dictated to it from Rome, Vienna, and Naples. The Princess Buttera, widow of a Prinee Scordia of Palermo, who has been residing for some mnonths at Florence on account of her own health, and in order to be near her children, who are at school there, has been orderedbytheTuscan Government either to separate herself from her children or with them to leave the Grand Ducalterritories ! And this is said to be the consequence of a private correspondence between the King of Naples and his good cousin of Tuscany, who dares not refuse to execute such paltry spite. The decision of a mother under these circumstances cannot be doubtful, and she will without loss of time transport herself atid family, notwithstanding the inclemency of the season, to the only free soil in Italy,-Piedmont. How changed in this is the Government of Tuscany from the mild despotism of the same Grand Duke previous to 1848 ! But now, while expelling widowed mothers, and prohibiting anything in the form of liberal publications, a new ordoanwnce permits the use of masks, and the small emrployds of -G-overnment, as my correspondent informls me, are advised to mask themselves at the fetes of the CarnivaL Sineethe ratification of the Austrian concordat, he says also, the Tuscan clergy have assumed greater pretensions, and everything tends to indicate a similar convention between Tuscany and Rome before long. The labours of the Sardinian Parliament during the last few days have been entirely confined to matters of local interest. This is the month, in which so manyanniversaries occur, forthe first time, of deaths in the Royal family. The Couirt is con. sequently in ietirement at Polenzo, and tho season' of Carnival is nearly as -dull this year at Turiiias ltt. .~ -, .. SPAIN. (Ns*3 OUR OWN cosRRsoNnE2NT.) --- MADRID, JAN. 19. - It is rumoured that an attempt will be made to repeat the events of the Tth on a larger scde, and Senor Calvo Asensio put a question to the Government yesterday on the subject, but Senor Escosura declared that order should be preserved at all cost, and that the Government was quite prepared for any event. There is littlo doubt that there are some parties who want a complete change of tlings in one sense or another, and who are striving to turn the distress which prevails in various parts, owing to the want of work and high price of provisions, to political account. In a great number of cases the heavy rains which still continue here and seem general throughout the country have put a stop to the public and private works going on, and numbers have been thrown out of work in consequence. Some hundreds of people went to the house of the first Alcalde yesterday, and others to Espartero, demanding employment, and the corporation met in extraordinary session last night to consider what can be done. Many-perhaps most of the applicants-were real cases of distress for want of employment, but others are probably of a different character, as was shown a few days since at Malaga. A Malaga journal, after giving an account of a tumultuous assemblage there on the 10th of men who all professed to be in a state of distress from want of food and labour, caUls attention to the fact that a number of them, who were taken by the MIunicipal Guard as they refused to disperse, were found al to have more or less money about them, the least sum being 12 reals (nearly 3s). Some had several Napoleons; or five-franc pieces, which still form the greater part of our silver currency, and pass for 19 reals each; and on one of them a gold ounce (16 dollars) was found, together with five Napoleons and other smaller silver coins. Many had pistols or other arms, including most formidable knives, called Ywrajas de mutee. The inundations produced by the heavy and longcontinued rains, which no one remembers to have lasted so long, have, besides tShe daminage to land and houses, a,ggravated thre distress prevalent in some parts by preventing communication with the districts from which they received their supplies of provisions, &c. This is the case at Seville; the country round it is under water, the Guadalquiver hascarried away the new stone bridge, and the suburb of TI!una, on the other side the river, is overflowed, and the water at San Bernardo is two yards deep, the only communication being b boats. People ascend the tower of the Giralda to see the sight. The garden attached to the Palace of San Telmo, the residence of the Duke and Duchess of Alontpensier, is under water, and the provincial deputation from a simila cause have applied for and obtained permission to hold their meetings at the Royal Alcazar at Seville in consequence. The tieatres and shops were aU shut, and great numbers of beggars paraded the streets. Various charitable associations contributed to relieve the distress; the corporation distributed dafly 900 large loaves, and the Duke and Duchess of Montpensier 600. At Malaga the authorities offered soup and bread to the necessitous, but persons were heard to address some of the assembled groups telling them not to accept food, but only pecuniary relief, a demand which the Alcalde of one district was weak enough to comply with ; but the Governor of the province, in a suitable address delivered on the occasion and since published, overruled this practice, and ordered a sufficient quantity of nutritious soup and bread to be distributed daily to each applcant, but no money given. The general law on anonymous companies of credit passed the Cortes at the close of the sitting| yesterday, and the reports in favour of three proposals for the formation of banks of credit sent in by the Credit Mobilier Company, by various firms established in Spain, and by M. Prost and other I French firms, were also adopted, and the concessions to form these companies voted. A deposit amounting to 10 per cent. on the first instalment on the shares issued, or of 1 per cent. on the total capital of the as-Dciation, must be lodged with the Caja General do Depositos within 30 days of the concession being given. The concession of the projected railway from Madrid to Saragossa to the Great Central of France is gazetted to-day, Count de 3Mory and the other directors being represented by Senor Salamanca. It is to go by way of Guadalajara, Siguenza, and Calatayud, and the Government to give a subvention of 240,000 reals per kilometre. A Royal commission has been appointed to report on the best means of removing impediments in the way of the internal traffic of the country in connexion with the proposed tariff reform, and the throwing open of the. salt monopoly. The MUarquis del Duero is named President of the Commissio'n, -which is of the directors-general of various branches of the revenue and other public: functionaries. The funds are a little flatter this afternoon. The Three per Cents. were done at 36 50, and the Deferred ditto at 23 20.

Trss SmawE BELGIQuE.-SoUTHArON, Jan. 25. -This new screw steamship, as stated in 27 Z 'i s of yesterday, returned to Southampton last night, having left this port for New York on the 6th inst. Iahe Belgique, as is already known, is the pioneer of a line of steamvessels fiom Belgium rid Southampton to America, to be followed by others now in course of construction. The Belgique was advertised to sail from this port on the 1st of Jana and in conimemoration of the event a ddjelIzer was Prepare, by the Mayor and corporation, to which Captain lack and the officers of the ship were invited. Unfortunately the vessel did not arrive until too late, and the banquet took place without the expected guests. Owing to an accident to thebollers, she did not sail again from this port nutilSnday morning, the 6thinst. Therewere thenon boardlfirstclass passenger, S second and 24 steerage or third-class passengers. bat4a'clock itheafternoon ofthe foDvowing day the Belgique was compelled to put into Plymouth, it being found that the vessel wcas leaky and tile pumps choked. tere she ewas inspected by Government officers, and, beingO temporarily repaired, put to sea agai on the 10th inst. other leaving Plymnouththe wi nd continued fair until the afternoon of the toth, when it shifted to the westward, and durino the night blewra gale, hichlastedttherfollowing day Onthes 1thnit ;as discovered that thc vessel had sprung a leak, and in the evening the captain finding that the exertions of the crew oere insufficient, demanded the assistance of the passengers to work the p tups , nit is stoated, e did not believe the ship w;ould host12 hours longer. The greatest consternation and alarm at once arose on hoard, and everybody immediately applied themselves most lustily to the pumps, but after working a short tune it wias found thatthey had become choked, and thereby rendered useless. Buckets wrere then brought into requisition, nine only of which were found on beard the ship, huthby the use of coolkin" and other utensiLs, together with the continued exertions ot the passengers and crewv, the water was kept under. This was continued until the Belgique had reiached about 70 muiles westward of the Lizard, when, in consequence of the vessel making water so fast it w,as deemed prudent by the captain to steer for the nearest land, which was supposed to be the Western Islands. UJpon this information those on board redoubled their exert.ions, and succeeded in further reducing the wvater in the ship, which at one time is said to have contained nine feet aft andfour-and-a-half in the engine-room. On secondconsideration it was determined by the officers of the vessel to make for Cork, but, the water still getting less, the captain fancied that he could continue the voyage to Ne ork. On hearing this the crewv at once decided upon doing no mnore work, and positively determined that, unless the ship was either taken back or put into a near port, they would do nothing more on board-a decision which Was agreed to by the passengers. On finding that to proceed would be useless, the captain at once shaped his course for Southatmpton. Besides the fact of the vessel havin leakedtoaconsiderable extent, it was discovered that one of the boilers was burnt out, and that the foremast and mainmast had both settled. The statements of the passengers (to some of whom we are indebted for the above, no partiears being procurable from the officers and those connected with the slup) are most deplsrable. They say that they were compelled. to live upon almost theworst of food, and that on the arrival of. the 'ship at Plymouth, finding that their rations were withheld from them, they purchased at that port necessaries to assist them during the voyage. The thirdclass passenger acoomniodation is also said to be of the worst description, not a portion of it being cleahed during, the whole time tha lelgique vas at'sea. The passengers state their entire dissatisfaction at tho conduct pursued on hoard the vessel, and they are now at this port, an.dously waiting an opportunity to proceed to New York. The cargo of the Belgique is to be discharged at Southampton; andbthe vessel will g6 into the dry.dock for repairs. The unfortunate commencement of this new line of steamers is much to be deplored, as, although it was foreseen the ships could never be expected'to comnpete with the British or Amdrican steamers on thuo New. Yorkcroute, yet such a succession of disasters was hatrdly looked for. lt is stated that the ships and engines are not in-accordance with the EBnglish - notionas on thEese mattters, anid that as at present coastrndct d the vessels are totally nutfit fosTran9satlitipl steam asnigationl,
B RTI - SH Y ' - '' hWA ]BRITISM -ARWWJ -THE, ORM. (nomi OUR OWb- CORRESNDENT.) ': CAMP BEFO1RE SEBASTOPOL, JAiX. IL The recent thaw, and the soft weather we have since had, have been very trying to'the new roads, which have supported the test -pretty welL Mlud there is, of course, in abundance, and mud there would be upon any roads on which the traffic was so great and constant as between the Camp and Balaliava, and here and there are holes and sunken places, but men are actively engaged in filling up and repairing, and I trust that our highways wvill be pretty tolerable throughout the winter. The nature of the 'stone employed in making them is unfavourable to their durability; it is a sort of mixture of lime and sand, which crumbles and softens under pressure and wet. Here in camp we have had a couple of days of that tremendously heavy weather which renders it necessary to keep a spade and besom at one's hut door, in order that one's visitors may be dug and swept out of the pedestal of mire mounted upon which they usually arrive. The changes of this climate are very rapid and great, and can hardly be healthfuL On Sunday we had the hard frost I described to you in my last; yesterday was a mild and delightful spring day, with a warm sun, and little wind, and people were sitting and standing out at their hut doors. Already, since the frost departed, in some parts of the camp the young grass begins to spring up. It is yet too early to suppose that the frost and snow are over for the winter. last year it froze hard and snowed heavily more than a month later than this, and a change of wind, too,may at any time bring us severe cold. Meanwhile we are making the best of the tolerable weather to complete the hutting, and all day long men are entering camp in large parties, bringing up boards and beams, so that, should the heavy rains stil hold off awhile, it is to be hoped that aU will be properly sheltered. As regards the dress of the men,; the short frocks lined with fur, and the fur and leather caps are comfortable and convenient, but in the article of boots they are less well provided. They wear boots up to the knees, drawn on outside the trousers, and made of tanned cowhide. The upper leather appears good, but I hear innumerable complaints of the soles, shape, and sewing. The boots are for the most part much too large, and give the men sore feet, besides adding greatly to the fatigue of walking. I have been told of many instances when, after a day or two's wear, the sole parted from the welt and upper leather. In short, that they may fit and wear, it is necessary that the feet of the boots should be remade; and, to do this to any serviceable extent there are not enough shoemakers in the army. So bad are these boots that some officers of corps have applied for permission to cut away the feet and convert the legs into greaves, to be worn with the aiamunition ancle boots; but it-is not known whether this will be allowed. The original idea of the boots was good; but then they should be strongly and closely sewed, so as to make them as far as possible waterproof, and they should be near. enough to an' exact fit for them not to be a drag upon the wearer when he walks up from Balaklava or the stores with a load upon his shoulder. I frequentlyseemen wading through the heavymud, and, at everystep they take, it seems a matter of doubt whether the boot will cling to their leg or remain sticldng in the road. Surgeons, too, have told me that the least sore on the foot becomes aggravated by the constant fretting and friction, so as in many instances to lay men up. One of two things is evident: either the Government has not paid a high enough price to obtain a good article (which is unlikely), or the contractors are making undue profits on inferior merchandise to that which they were bound to supply. The sufferers are the soldiers and the service. The Fourth Division of Her Britannic Majesty's army in the Crimea is rapidly acquiring the name of the "Fast Division," on account of the energy and vivacity of its efforts to be jolly under difficulties and to dispel the tedium of winter in camp. its greatest and most successful attempt in this way has unquestionably been the establishment of a Theatre Royal, with dresses, scenery, properties, orchestra, and all other requisites. Towards 8 in the evening, from various points of the camp, the audience may be seen converging towards the edifice in whicb the performances take place. It needs a strong love of the drama or a great aversion to evenings at home to take a man from his hut at night in this season, and to send him floundering through the slough of I despond, intersected with ditches and dotted with holes, on which stands the British camp before Sebastopol. In the absence of hackney coaches lanterns are in request, and there is never aoomplaint of empty benches, but, on the contrary, tickets are greatly in demand. The theatre (which is soon to be exchanged for a larger one, about to be constructed) is half hut half tent, wooden sides, and a framuework roof filled up with alternate breadths of canvass and chintz; small shelves, fixed round the walls, suipport candles; the orchestra, including three violins, enlivens the audience in the intervals of the performance with waltzes and polkas, interspersed with such popular airs as " Sir Roger de Coverley," 0 Pop goes the Weasel," &c. Boxes and gallery there are none, but one large pit, with rows of benches, not very solid, and which occasionally give way, depositing their occupauts upon the floor, which, in such weather as we have lately had, and thanks to Crimean accumulations on the boots of comers-in, is unpleasantly apt to assume the appearance of a muddy road. But such small desagrg meats as these are trifles in Crim Tartary, where mud and brokenbenches are too common to excite attentionor cause annoyance. The curtain, neatly constructed out of an old tent, draws aside, 'and the play begins. The first pieces performed were To Paris and Back for Five Pomnus, and Box and Coz Jfarried and Settled. These had a very satisfactory run. A week ago they were replaced by two other farces. Here is the printed bill of. the play-not sold at the doors:- "THEATRE ROYAL.-FOURTH DIVISION.

From. the preceding you perceive that tlhe Foiaath Division ccrps drnmatiue is entirely of the mascu- gender. You must not on that account imagine that we have not highly fascinating jeitnesjfremi7eres and most seduictiv~e sou2ffettes. Notwithstanding the absence of stays M.r. Lacy waS a charming Betsy Chirrup, and his agonies of apprehension and jealousy as Lousa Fitzjohnson drew tears (of laughter) from the audience; Mr. Stuart was highly correct as Mrs. Barker, and Mr. Saunderson cast down his eyes with becoming modesty in the character of the ittorney's daughter. Of course, the Ladies were got up with an ample amount of buckram and padding, and, although they all looked rather solid armfuls, one could not feel at all surprised at their power over the hearts of their respective admirers. Of the male characters, the most perfect was that of John Buttercup, extremely well acted by Lord Alexander Russell, who showed considerable experience of the stage. CaptainEarlewas verycomic and Buckstonian as the moustached attorney's clerk; Dr. Shelton was ferociously Hibernian as Cornelius O'Pake, every hair of his whisker hinting at slugs in a sawpit, and his demeanour, when arrested by the two policeman, was that of a lion, overpowered but untamed. The said policemen, be it observed (they were very correctly attired in blue, with the due allowance of letters and numbers on their collars), were bandboys of the Rifles, each about three feet high. Their heads barely reached to Lieutenant O'Pake's elbow, and their desperate efforts not to grin, as they hung on by his wrists, resulted in a series of physiognomical contortions quite painful to contemplate. The minor characterswere all respectably filled, and the scenery (painted by that distinguished artist Mr. Shaw, of the 21st Fusileers), [although not quite equal to Grieve or Beverley, passed muster very well in a Crimean hut. The performance over, the curtain was again lifted, and there was a dance uponthe stage, in which the actresses displayed infinite grace, although they rather detracted from the feminine effect by exchanging their bonnets for hats and forage-caps, and by placing cigars between their beautiful lips. The firsttwo performances, on Saturday and3Monday last, were for the men, the two succeeding ones for the officers of the Fourth Division, and those of last night and to-ni,ght for offlcers of the army generally. The new house, which will accommodate a much larger audience than the present one, is expected to open in about 10 days.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-3r. Skinner professes to answer my challenge in "a few words," which, however, are ten times more than rny question. Out of this superfluity of words, that looks as if designed to obscure the confession he is forced to nmake, I gather that he cannot produce one single instance in vhich, since the existence of our present liturgy, his consruction of the rubric prevailed. On that point I am ratisfied. But, thus admitting the universal and invariable usage,he tries to get rid of its authority by asserting that " in my first letter I did not hang my case on that issue." Has Mr. Skinner eyes ? has he a memory? or is he trying to answer a letter that he never read? I appeal to that letter, and to every m'an who has read it, whether the chief, the mai, the Iconclusive argument of that letter, was not usage - "1 the umiversal and undeviating practice of the church;" "'that all sufficient justification, uninterrnpted usage"; "usage, the paramount interpreter of all law f ",the unde. -iating usage is as old as the rubric itself ; even the strictness of our common Law admits that communis erorfacit jus, so that,'even iflmy interpretation were erroneous, it is so common, so universal, so hitherto undisputed, that it may be taken on that wide ground to be now the law of the church." There are passages of that first letter in which Mfr. Skinner ventures to say that I " did not hang the case on the issue of usage." Your readers will observe that Mrr. Skinner, after what I must call shuffling through the question put to him, endeavours to start a new ihare, and, ad inridiarmz, " wonders whether I will insist on pews and a sitting posture," Uw. This impertinence (I use the word in its strict as well as its secondary meaning) is only worth notice as showing Mr. Skinner's a-tiety to escape from the topic which he had volunteered to handle, but finds too hot to hold.

CAM,IBRDGE VNV2EBSrTy ELECTIOVR. TO THE EDITOR OF THE T1IES. Sir,-We, the electors, naturally expect to be informed of the political sentiments of the candidates.

IHe says in his address,-" It is aImost needlers for me to state m litical opinions and princples, as they may be betteriaTved of by my votes and my conduct than they can be by any professions of my own." -Whenamemberretrm.s to his previous constitents he may reasonably presme that theynave watched his Parlia- yentai7 conduc. But why should the University electors observe particuaarly that of the memberfor 3lidhi ' ? High as the nan c of Walpole starids iu political and lite-r eminence, he who now rejoices in it mnust have an excee ingly exalted notion of-his own poetion to believe that all jicademic5l eyes would be intent own-his course. Or, scondly, does he seuose that they thusvob e the conduct of every LP. t e whole of any maws tin e woul ecarcely suffice for this.

LA W BREPOT. COURT OF CqTANCERY. LPTOaNNS-NIN. JA. 2N-. ITOOPER V. COOKE. I (Before tfli LoiD CHANCELLORJ) sS uas in appeal trom a dIecree 0t the laster of the Rolls. B indentures of lease and release, dated the 6th and7th of ugust, 1778, a piece of land was conveved by Peter lIooper (through vihom the plaintiff claimed) to Jolm Perry and his heirs, to the ulse that the said Peter looper, his heirs and assign6, should and might for ever thereafter receive and take from and out of the premises thereby conveyed the yearly sum of 4L, with power, in case of the non-payment of the said rent-charge, to distrain npon the said premises for the same, and to enter upon the said premie and receive the rents until the said rent-charge should be fully satisfied, and all arrears which should growr due while he or they should be in possession. "toiether with all costs. charrs and expenses as should belaid out and expended by hum or them, or occasioned bythe non-paynent thereof." In 1822 the piece of land, together with some messuages erected thereon, was sold, subject to the said rent-charge of 41., in consideration of a perpetual rent-charge of 401., which becamevested inthe defendant Cooke. In 1342 the premises had become greatly dilapidated and untenantahle, and, having remained unproductive until 1855, the plaintiff (whose rent-charge had not been paid since 1841) brought ejectment and obtained possession of the premises. T e defendant's rent-charge of 40?. had also remained unpaid since 1842. The plaintiff repaired the premises in a substantial manner, at a cost of upwards of 500t., and had sincebeeninpossession of therents, amounting in the wholeto 396?.13s. 4d. Hehad, however, expended a fArthersum of 2071.7s. 4d. in necessary repairs, leaving a large suam due in resaect of his outlay and the arrears of the rentcharge. The defendant, the owner of the rent-charge of 401., made de-inand of possession, but the plaintiff refused to deliver up the possession except upon being paid the balance due in respect of the repairs, and the arrears of the rent-charge. The defendant then commenced an action of ejectment, and the plaintiff, being advised that he had no defence at law, allowed judgment to go by default, and filed the present bill to restrain the defendant from taldng possession of the premises, except upon the terms of paying the arrears of the rent-charge, together with the moneys expended by the plaintiff upon the premises. The Master of the Rolls, upon the hearing of the cause, dismissed the bill with costs. From this decision the plaintiff appealed. M{r. Ls.OXr, Mr. SELWI-N, and Mr. HowE were heard for the appellanut. Mr. R. PniBst and Mfr. WmEUBRnsc supported the decree. Mr. SELWYN having replied, The LoxD CuASCEnnoR delivered judgmern, and, alter going through the facts as above stated, said the case of the plaintiff depended upon two questions-1st, whether by the true construction of the deed of 1778 he had a lien upon the property for the money he had laidout in improving it; and 2dly, assumning the plaintiff possessed no legal lien, was the dIefendant estopped from setting up that defence by reasn tof is conduct, as alleged by the plaintiff, in remainin; quiet nwhile the money as laid out, and thereby acquiescdng in theproprietyof theeRlpendituren Uipon thelastpon t,if itwere necessary to decide at, he (th Lord Chc olaitr) would be iN favour of the view tha ere had been no acquiescence to prejudice the defendant. hEowever, on the main pointnanmelythatrelating to the lien-he entirely concurredr ith the oaeter of the Rolls in thinkiing that the question was notone for a court of equity. Eitherhthe plaintiff had a legal right to the possession of the property, or he had not. Nlow, all arrears of the rent-charge of 4t. had long since been paid out of the rents of the houses, unless the plaintiff was entitled to say that he was also out of therthbe ecouped the amount he bad expended in improving the property. W hether he was s,o entitled was a pure q6uestion of law, upon which, of course, hinged his rtee to retain possession of the premises, and owhich tprned upon the construction of the deed granting the rentcharge. It wvas for a court of law to say whether the money laid out by the plaintiff in improving the property w-as an excpense " occasioned by the non-payment of the rent-charge ?' and therefore he (the Lord Chancellor) would not prejudice the case by expressing any opinion upon the matter. There was no difficulty whatever in obtainig the decision of a court of law upon the subject, and therefore the appeal must be dismissed with costs. As, however, the plaintiffliad made a slip in sayinghe was advised that he had no valid defence at law, the bill would be dismissedl jfupon the terms that the defendant withdrew his judgment gained by default in order to try the action upon its merits. All proper admsissions would also be made on each side to bringthe n fairly.to an issue, whether the covenant in the deed let in the expenditure incurred by the plaintiff -Ordered accordingly. LEE V. GREES. This appeal from a decree of Vice-Chancellor Stuart was argued on Saturday last, and stood over for judgnt The facts were that the plaintifs obtained a decree of this Court against a person named Holmes, and on the 10th of August 1253, registered the LaLe, in order to make it a charge upon his real estate under the statute. Holmes was declared an insolvent subsequent to the prenouncing of the decree of this Court, but prior to its being registered, and on the 2Sd of July, 1853, a vesting order was made by the Insolvent Court of all his real and personal estate in an as agnee. This order had not been registered according to the provisions of the statute 1st and 2d of Victoria, chap. 110, and the question, therefore, arose vhether the plaintiff's right under the decree of this Court had beun in any way interferede ith by the vesting order before mentioned. The ViceCancelor held that it had not, and made a decree to that effect in favour of the plaintiffs. The LofsoCeAmCELLO now gave judgment, and said thatbeforethepassing of the act making decreesof this Court available against real estate no such right existed at aw;. By that statute it was necessary that the decree should be registered, and, until that was done, he was of opinion that the decree acquired no additional power under the sta- tute. In the present case the vesting order in in solvencyl had been made previously to the regsration of the decree, and under such order, therefore, all the insolvent's estate became vested in his assignee. The judgment of the Court below must be reversed.| (Before TheC LORDS JvgnIcxs.)I DAVIAS V. T11E E:ARL OP DYS!.RT. After the disposal of the petitions in lunacy, the Court| was occupied a considerable tune in this appeal motion from a decision of the MIaster of the Rolls.

DrE 1VTRV'1N- - (Before Vice-C?hanecdtor Sir ToM STUArRT.) *XJs was a motion on behalf of the plaintiffs, that the first defendant, De Virenne, might be ordered, under section 44 of the 15th and 16th of Victoria, chap. 86. to represent one Hudson in this suit under the following circumstances: -This suit was instituted by a manager and shareholder and the representatives of deceased co-managers and shareholders of an association for trading purposes in India against De Virenne, a shareholder, and the representatives of deceased shareholders, except the representative of a shareholder namedHudson, who died several years ago in Calntta, having by his will appointed the defendant, De Virerine, his executor, who proved the same in India. The biR praved for an acconxt of the partnership assets, and for a contrsbution among the shareholders towards paying offthe liabilities of the partnership. Hudson hadnopersonal representative in this country, and De Virenne had refused to take out administration to him here. Mr. C. 1L Roupell supported the motion, and Mr. Rogers resisted it. The VICE-CHaNCELLOr made an order as asked. (Before Vice-CAianedlor Sir W. P. WooD.) STIFF V. CASSELL A3D OTHES. This was a motion for an injunction on the part of the -plaintiff, the proprietor of the London Touriusd, to restrain Mr. John Fredenck Smith (one of the defendants) from writing the continuation of a tale of which he is the author, called Dick Tarleton; or Lewons of Life, or any other tale or work of fiction, or otherwise, for (Asssdl's Fiustrated Family Bceicapoer, or for any other publication which shall be sold for a less price than 6&L; and to restrain the other defendants, who are the proprietors of the newspaper in question, from publishing or vending the said tale, or any continuation thereof, &c. The suit involves a dispute bcetween the proprietors of the two rival periodicals, each having an extensiva and profitable circulation, as to which of them shall be entitled to the exclusive services of the defendant Smith, Iwho, in addition to Dick Yarledon, has written various other tales or works offiction, under the titles of Woman and he, Master, Hinnie Grey, The Soldier of Fortune, &c., this question depending upon the constrction and priority in int of date of certain agreements which have been made Ct=een the author and the respective proprietors of the two periodicals. Mr. Rolt, Mr. W. M James, and 3Mr. Smythe a peared in support of the motion; on the opening of -w-ch an objection was taken on behalf of Smith by Mr. WILLcoCe (with whom was Mr. W. Morris), that i' should not be proceeded with at all events as against him, he having been su3mmoned by electric telegraph from Tours! on Monday evfeninlg l.ast only, and not having, as he deposed, had time to meet the case, which he accordingly asked migtht stand over, and that a spedial examiner ms8ht be anpointed with a view to the exmination of thevansous parties. The motionthen proceeded as againstheotherdefend&nts, and atthe conclusion of the plaintiff's case, The VIaE-CEaNELose said that he must certainly Lear the case made by the defendants, but it had strack him all alongasbeing most inconvenient that it should not be hesrd as against Smith at the same time, and it would be better that some arrangement should be come to for the motion to stand over altogether till next seaL Mr. D-N=um (with whom is Mr. Goren) for the defendants Cassell, retter, and Galpin, the propnetors of the newspaper, said that they were quite ready to agree to this ar""'irent, but that they could not undertake not to pub is the next number of the periodical, on which great .labour had been.already expended and capital. laid out, the practice being to prepare the nambers ome weeks before actual pub'lication. It was ultimately arraged that r.

Priws, at Guildha?Z, befo.n Mr. J"ulicc ERL andc ommon Juriea.) This was the first day of the second sittings in london. BtTTCHI-f V. PRICE. The plaintiff stated in his declaration that the defendant bad, without reasonable afid probable cause, given the plaintiff into custody on a charge of felony, and had had him taken before a magistrate, who discharged hini; that the defendant had afterwards preferred an indictment against him at the Central Criminal Court, and on the indictment coming on for trial he was found " Not guilty " that the plaintiff had brought an action against the defendant, chwas tried on the 10th of June, 1854, when a verdict was found for the plaintiff, and that the defendant had since obtained a rule fora new triaL The defendant pleaded '*Not guilty," and that he had reasonable and probable cause for SUppOSing the plaintiff guilty of a felony. Mfr. Serjeant Thomas and Mr. Chamock appeared for the elaintiff; and Mr. Home and Mfr. Campbell Sleigh for the It appeared from the case as stated on behalf of the plaintiff that he was a plumber and glazier at Hackney, and the defendant was the trustee of certain property in leetstreet. The plaintiff's father kept a publichouse sn Wilderness-lane, near the St-and. On the 2h of October, 1852, a person of the name of Mullins, who kept a publichouse at, 183, Fleet-street, called upon the elder Butcher, and offered him some beer engines and the metal tubes attached to them for the sumn of 21. The plaintiff agreed to take thenm at that sum, and went with his sen to bring them away. They took the beer engines home, and on retuning to get the metal tubing they were given into custody by a person of the name of Bunn, who was acting as thagent of the defendant, to whom the house occupied by Mullins belonged. They were taken before Sir R. W. Carden, the magistrate at Gtildhall, and charged with stealig the articles they had purchased; but on the case being heard they were discharged. The defendant, not satisfied with this, preferred a bill of indictnent before the grand jury behind his back, and he was again put upon his trial or stealing the beer engines, and again acquitted. Witnesses were called in support of this statement. The plaintiff, on being cross-examined, said that he bad never been in custody for stealing bills; he had never been before a magistrate for five minutes on such a charge. He had been in custody on a charge of stealing bricks, but that had been dismissed. The defence was, that the defendant had let the premises i in question to Mullins, with all the fixtures which were upon them, and that Mullins had no right to sell them to the plaintiff; that the plaintiff had been informedat the time he and his father were taking the things away that the articles were the property of the defendant, and that Mullins had no right to sel them; and that, notwithstanding what was said to them, the plaintiff and his father had removed them to their own premises. On the plaintiff being taken before the magistrate, that gentleman having formed an erroneous op'mon about lMullins having the right to sell the beer-engines, the defendant had conddered himself justilled in going before X grand jury and preferring an indictment against the plantiof, as he bad good grouends for believing that the plaintiff had taken the things feloniously, he knowing that they wiere not the property of utlinst A ifrther defence was, that the plaintiff was given into custody by Bnnn without the authority of the de fendant. Evidence s as called in support of this view of the case. Mullit s swore that he did not sell the beer-engies to the plaintiffis father. The counsel addressed the jury for their respective clients. His IORDwsmr, in summing up, said that the first nestion ifor the jury wrould he whether or not they believed that the defendant bad taken upon himself the act of Bunn in giving the plaintiff into custody; if they found that he did not do so, then their verdict would be for the defendant. But if they should think the other way, then they must say wheher they thought there was such reasonable and probable cause as to justify the defendant in giving the plaintiff into custody, and afterwards prosecuting him. If on both points they found for the plaintiff, then they must say to what damages they considered him entitled. The jury gave a verdict for the plaintiff on the first question, with 15i. damages; but they did not think the defendant had prosecutedmaliidously. ** In the report of the case of " Bruce v. Measor and wife," in the Coart of Queen's Bench, mentioned in Tec Tim`s of yesterday, it was stated that the plaintiff is the editor of the CiviZ So-vice Gazette. Mr. John Boulger requests us to say that he is now the editor of that paper, 3r. Bruce's connexion with which, he says, ceased in "ulast.
COURT OF COMMON PLEAS, WEsTusmm, J,u. 25. (SiWings in Banco, in Hilary Terms) This was a special paper day, and the Court was occuped all day with earing a technical argument ofno public interest. (Sittings at Nisi Prius, at Guilda, before Mr. Justice Wuss aud a Comnmon Jury.) LISTOTT V. THE SOU'TH-EASTE5Li RAILWAY COWTA. Mr. Serieant Byles, Mr. Hawkins, and Mr. J. Thompson were counsel for the plaintiff; and Mr. Knowles, Q.C., and M. Monk appeared for the defendants. This was an action brought to recover damages for an assault and false imprisonment of the plaintiff by the servants of the defendants. In the month of Novemtber last the plaintiff went with some other persons, includizng a little boy, to visit some property of which he was the owner, near Gravesend, and returned by one of the trains of the defendants, which left Northfieet about 5.22 p.m. On their arrival at New-cross, where the tickets of the up-passengers are usually collected, the boy's ticket was missing, and the plaintiff, or his friends, told himto hide himself behind them ia the carriage; he was, however, discovered by the collector, and on the plaintiff's refusal to pay for him he was, according to the account of his witnesses, taken out of th5 carriage by the servants of the company, and detained in the waiting-room of the station until the nex' train passed, when ho was forwarded to London. It appeared that the missing ticket was found, and it was urged that, although the plaintiff had acted wrongly in inducing the boy to hide himself, yet that no fraud upon the railway company was intended. The defence was, that the plaintiff was drunk, and that so far from having been dragged out of the carriage he had insisted upon getting out hiimself and being detained at the station, and witnesses were called who swore distinctly that no assault had been committed on him, and that he had not been imprisoned for a single moment. Mr. Jusice WILLES carefully summed up the case to the jury, and remarked that there were many discrepancies in the evidence given on either side, but that it was their duty to say to which set of witnesses they gave the most credit Alter a short consultation the julry returned a verdict for the plaintiff-damages al.
COURT OF EXCEHEOUER. JA. 25. In RE THE EARL OF CORNWAT.T;. 19 ! fSittine in Ban en. This was a rule on the part of the Coinnissioners of Inland Revenue, raising the question for the opinion of this case, whether the legacy duty on four annuities crested by the will of the late Ear of Corwallis should be calculated according to the tables and on the scale in existence at the tine of that nobleman's death, or in accordance with the tables and on the higher scale created by the Succession Duty Act (16th and 17th of Victoria, chap. 51), which, though it did not come into operation till after the death of the earl, was yet in operation at the time when the executors, at the termination of a year, required the commissioners to calculate the amount of duty due to the Crown. On that occasion the commissioners claimed to affix the higher scale of duties unader the recent act, but the executers objected thereto on the groud that, as the annutihes bore date on and attached from the death of the testator, the coutrse proposed woulld give a retrospective operation to the new act. Under these circumstances the present proceeding was adopted. Mr. M Sara and Mr. HODososs appeared for the executors; and contended that on the true construction of the act the] duties ouqht clearly to be calcullated under the old tables; buat that, if it was left in doubt, the Court ought to construe the act in favoutr of the subject, and adopt that scale which would inflict the lowest amount of duty. Mlr. BIGOnT, for the Crown, argued that, on the plain words of the 31st section of the Succession Duty Act, the commissioners were bound to adopt the scale therein provided, as they had been required to calculate these duties "after that act came into operation!' Until the commissioners had so calculated there was no specific debt due to the Crown, though, no doubt, some amount of duty was payable; and, if the period for making that calculation did not occur till after the act came into operation, the tables therein prescribed mutest be followed, even though the duties attached in respect of anntnties created by the will of a testator who died before the act was passed. The Cnrsr Bnt.os said, at the close o1 the argument, that judgment woulld be delivered shtortly. Judgment deferred. (Sittings at Guildha1Z-in Hilary Term, at Nisi Pr Ls, before Ml'. Baron BRAnsWxLr and Commonz Jurfes.) This was the " second sittings" in the present term for the trial of London cause.- The list contained 24 cases for trial, one-half of which number came under the-deuominstion " remanets.". Iflf V. DATTflS Mr. Mellor and 3Mr. Archbold conducted the case for the plaintiff, and Mr. Edwin James, with Mr. Hawkins, represented the defendant. This was an action to recover the sum of 751., the amount of abill of exchange which the plaintiff had given to the defendant, and paid for three shares in the South Wheal Jane Gold Mine, in CornwalL. Thiappeared to be one of the very many mining speen-. lations hr1eriZ compames to work ther have een projected, in some of whichthefoimatior of the company baa beenachieved, whileinthe bthersthatend hasnot een omplinbed, The present adventute ce with the latter categor-the company was flot formed, the cqpital 'was not raised, the ine s not work6d, and so far as was apparent the concern had been abandoned. It had been pro. posed to divide the mine into 512 shares of 15L each, the deposit to be paid as follows -5l. per share on allotment, 1 51. more per share in four mnonth,s and the remaining 5. per share in eight maonths. Then it was proposed that a sum of 2,56%V. of the capital should, so soon as the deposits were paid, be appropriated to the workin of the mine. With the view of aig the interests of the comnpany, a meeting was held at Southampton, at which a deputation from London were in attendance, and, in consequence of the flourishingyrospects shown in the statenients made, the present plainti said he was induced to. make the purchase of three shares at 25g. each, through a - gentleman named Dyne. For those shares the plaintiff gave his acceptance for 75L That bill he paid, and he now brought his action to recover from the defendant, to whom the shares he had purchased had belonged, and to whom his acceptauco had been remitted by Dyne, the person from whom he had bought them. Several witncsses were calUed for the defence, but there ws no evidence given to show that the comrany had been completed, that there was any costbook, or mideed that the mine had been worked. It was, however, attempted to be proved that the defendant had not sold the shares in question, but that they- had been sold by a mining aent, named Francis, to Dyne, aind by the latter resold to the plaintiff Mr Ji3nsrs, having summed up the evidence for the defendant, Mr. MELLor was heard in reply. Mr. Baron BRA3WELL left it to the jury to say whether the evidence had proved to them that this mining com-an had or had not been formed. If they should be of o that it had not been formed, but was what was denoninated an abortive company, then, in that case, the representations upon which the plaintiff had made his purchase of these shares was not a correct represeatation, and he would be entitled to recover back the money he had paid for them. They would also say whether, in their opinion, the dealing had, through Dyne, been between the defendant and the plaintiff. The jury consulted a short time, and then returned a verdict for the plaintiff-damages, including interest, 76!. 16s. 6d. They also found that the plaintiff had paid this money to an abortive comrny, an that the dealng was between the plaintiff and the defendant. Verdict entered accordingly.

He doubted whether the ban]krupt was possessed of the. capital of 679L, as set forth in his accounts. The present debts and liabilities were 2,000, and the assets did not exceed the statutable 2niniunzs with which he could come into that court. The trade and personal expenditure was 1,0321., and the profits were only 5i41 There was no fraud, but there was ample evidence of reckless trading; and on that ground the Court would adjourn the certificate for 12 months from this date, and, when granted, to be of the second class. Hois HooulR granted protection for three months, refusing the application of a creditor for certificate for arrest.
rNSOLVEZT DEBTORS COVT, Jaan. 25. Lf RE JOVATnAx nrrce (Before the CamF Com3ssioNxi This insolvent applied under the Protection Act. Mr. Macrae had opposed on the first hearing on behalf of Mr. Baxter, vwho hnd sold the insolvent a quantity of osiers, for which he was a creditor to tho extent of 611, and the Court on that oceasion was of opinion that the insolvent's conduct had not been quite fair, and that an immaediate final order would not be granted. The insolvent to-day offeredto set aside 151. a-year from his earnings as a fellowship porter for the benefit of his creditors. Mfr. MYACRA., on behalf of M£r. Baxter, accepted that proposal, and withdrew the opposition. A day was accordingly named for the final order. (Before Mr. Commissioner MURPHY.) LS RE HENRY SQUIES SSHRAPNEL. This insolvent, son of the late General Shrapnel, the inventor of the Shrapnel shell, applied to be discharged from prison. Mr. Sargood opposed for Messrs. Paine and Co., drapers, at Maidstone. The insolvent had been a lieutenant in the West Rent Militia, and was indebted to opposing creditors in the sum of 961., of wlhich 50W. was money advanced upon the deposit of a bill of exchange for 391., accepted by the insolvent's brother, now in Canada. The remainder of the debt was for goods supplied. The insolvent, upon being questioned as to his roeans at the time of contracting the debt, admitted that he was in embarrassed circumstances, but, in consequence of the great public utility of his father's invention, espeeialy at Sebastopol, he had been promised, and expected to obtain, an appointment under Government. He had had some property near Maidstone which he had dispesed of. Mlr. S.1GOOD complained that his clieri'ts debt had been contracted without reasonable expectation of payment, and asked that farther information respecting the sale of property might be given. Mr. Lrais, the insolvent's attorney, said, his client was utterly without means to produce witnesses. He had been compelled to remain in prison since March for want of means to petition, and now it was only by the aid of an allowance from the Court that he was enabled to apply for his discharge. Mr. Comnissioner MURnY said, as regarded one portion of the opposing creditor's debt, that for goods, the insolvent was not justified by his circumstances in mcurring it but his long imprisonment was a sufficient expiation. As the insolvent was evidently in great poverty, the Court would receive the further evidence required by the opposing creditors upon affidavit, and upon its production the iasolvent woulda discharged. The case was then adjourned until Tnesday.

Last year, vhen the mighty Baltic armament wD assembling at Spithead, two or three persons essayed in the public prints to bring tne heads of departments to 6 sene of the necessity of having small steamboats for conveying: both officers andmen in bad weather to and from the sbhorc at stated times during the day. If, Sir, it is necessary for the pomp and observance of war etiquette to make ships ro out to Spithead and Plymouth Sound, surely the lives that are risked by it oh ghtto have some consideration shown for them. If the hearts of officials have become hardened and proof to the finer feelings of an enlightened public, it is high time that efforts should be made to soften them. Last war, I read, men had very little liberty g mted them, but now it is quite the reverse; shore istherule ship. the exception; therefore that presents an additional and very cogent reason for the Admiralty to order something of the sort; but, perhaps, as in the early days of rmilways. no improvements took place until a director was kIlled, so, in this respect, until an admiral or some bigwig is drowned, will there be no redres.

THEm; L' D2L.wPROC DEDI NGS TEIx uzLzr CAqy.-The relations of Palmer and the friends intercate&L in his defence complain strongly of the prejudgment of his, case by the press, and consequently by the public. Theyrepresent that, as all the circumstances alleged amount to nothing without the medical evidence which unites anud directs them with fatal perspicuity to a point, the case will, in fact, turn on a queSsSon of science, on which they areprepared to Prove a difference of opmion inhigh authorities; that the fiu=ln* of antimony in the body of Mrs PaImErmay not be] considered the findind of voisomny that, bowever correct Professor Taylor's analysis, his reasoning: from its results may be illoical, and his deductions perhaps scientifically incorrect in the judgment of higher adepts in chymistry. They alege themselves to be doubtfuL of getting afair and impartial hearing, so great is the accu-- mulation of prudice. It is intended, therefore, to rcmove thecase, ifpossible, tothe civil side by certioran, with a-view of obtaining a trial by specialjury, as well as to change ther venue. But a special jury does not follow as a matter of right, even though th%. case be removed. The statute & George IV., c. 50, sec. 30, relating to speciaIjuries, does 3ot give a special jury in criminal cases, so that it is a questionx whether the common law jurisdiction of the Queen's Bench is sufficient forthat Court to grant one. It is quite possib,e that the Court will exercise this power, if the Crowvn consent, as it possibly may in a case ef so peculiar a descn . tion. Should Palmer's legal advisers fil in this course, t certiorari will be applied for, and an attempt will also be made to obtain atrialat bar, where aspecialjury could be granted. In Viner's "Abri?gVrn&nt,' Trial N., mention is made of a prosecution for highway robbery at the instance of the hundred, where the ground fora trialat bar was that it was fearedhe would be too violenxtly prosecuted' that the hundred might discharge themselves by his conviction. In Palmer's case the defendant has the same fear from a different cause. A BuRar_t CAVuCT rY A DoG.-James Wilson, -who stated that he was a shoemaker from &eeds, was charged before the Sheffield matitrte on Thursday with breaking into the house of Jobm tarsn, of Spital-street, Tomeross-lane, on Tuesday night. It appeared -in evidenco that MIrs. HIarrison went to bed a little after U i'clock, placing the key of the house door, which she h locked, on the ledge inside the window, closing the window ana shutters, but not fastening them, that her husband might be able to get in without difficulty on his return. About 1 o'clock on Wednesday morning Mr. Samuel Warburton, butcher, Tomcross-lane, and his two sons, who are about 14 orl6 years of age, were passng, on their way to the railway station, and, on turning the corner into Spital-street, saw the prisoner getting out of Harrison's house window. The prisoner, who had white stockings on, and his boots in his hand, jumped out of the window, and ran into a yard belonging to the house. One of Mlr. Warburton's sons followed him, Mr. Warbuton himslf running towards the end of the passge leading into the yard. Prisoner immedately aftciwards rushed out of the passage, and ran up Spital-street as fast ss he could. Mr. Warburten followed calling to his other son, who was at the top, to stop the man. TSe boy attempted to comply with his father s command, and was knocked down by the Prisoner. Mr. Warburton, whoWas accompanied byhis dog, thereupon called out, "Stand aside, lad, andl'll make the dog catch him," and immediatelyaerwards said to the dog, "Fan, go and catch him." The animal, which was .nite eanal to the task, ran after the prisoner, and, coming up with him before he could get out of sight, seized him, and threw him down, without, however, doing him any injury. llr. Warburton ran up and seized the prisoner, 'hc had still his shoes in his hand, andwho raidtohim, " You would not have caught me, but Iwas afraid the dog would worry me." Prisoner was obsezved to take something fromn his pocket, and throw it away. He was taken back to Harrison's house by Mr. Warburton, who found the sash of the window more than half up, and called up Mrs. Hlarrison, whose husband had not returned. She, on coming down stairs, found that z jcket and other articles belonging to her husband and a lodgerhad been removed from the place where she left ther, and placed inside the. window ready to be taken away. - The prisoner was conveyed to the Town Hall and deliveredinto the custody of Constable William J,aughton, who found upon him a 'box of matches and a fawn-tibket.

The-Royal mail packet ship Champion of the Seas has arrived, with advices irom Melbourne to Tthe 27th of October,:188 passengers, and124,000 nicea of gold on freight. She also brings a large 'Caalo, which includes 1,185 bales of -wool, 13 bales f shleepgkins, 40 casks of tallow, 382 packages of 'tin ore, 3,120 bags of copper, 3 easks of oil (the produce ofiNewZeaLand), &c. The packet ship James Baines 'with the mails of ,the 5th oE Augus, arrived at VZelbourfie after a ]?assage of 7 dags from L;iverpool. Theelectorni. lists for the mining districts had been issued. 7he polling was fixed for the 15th of November. The Avgus remarks:- a e "oWe-werealreadyfeeling impatient, and we think not writhou.t jug groumds, at the prorogation to the 6th of November. The nevr constitution is now here, and for many Seasons. it is most desirable that it should be brought into operation as soon as possible." - A public meeting was held ini Melbourne on the 15th 'of October to: consider the conduct of Sir Henry Young, the Lieutenant-Governor of Tasmania, in endeavouring (to use the words of the Melbourne Herold), first, to " browbeat -the Legislature of thai colony, and, failing int his attempt, to thwart *further proceedings by a sudden and ill-advised prorogation." The mecttng was presidea over by the chief -magistrate.- The followitng resolutions were adopted: " L That the power recently claimed and asserted by the legislative Council of Tasmaniato compel the attendance of vtnesses to be examined before select committees of the *said Council is indispensable to the due exercise of one of the most important functions of a legislative assembly. "' 2. That the arbitraryconduct of SirHenry FoxYoung, the Governor of Tasmania, in suddenly proroguing the Council for the purpose of forcibly suppressing inquiry into the conduct of certain officers of the convict department of the colony, charged with the grossest malversation of their respective offices, and the Unprecedented mode of prorogation adopted by him, in going into the Council at a late hour of the night, in the midst of a debate, without the Isual formal notice, is an abuse of the powers confided to himt byEHer Most Gracio ts MEajesty, which is calculated to bring her name and authority into contempt, and which old, -if successful, be utterly destrectivo of the independence of the Legislatureg "39 Tha' this meetingasympathizes with the Legislative Council of T.smaniain their conflict with an arbitra and irresponsible Executive, and tenders to the said Counci the assurance of its cordial support in m.aitaining inviolate their right to inquire into abuses affectin" the welfare of the colony, and thereby maintaining the righsts and liberties of the people whomtheyrepresent. " 4. W'hat the right worshipful the chairman be requested to forward cop,ies of the resolutions passed at this meeting to the lon, the Speaker of the Legislative Council of Tasmania, to his Excellency Sir Henry Fox Young, the Governor of that colony, and to his Excellency Sir Charles otham, };.C.B, Governor of Victoria, weith a request that his Excellencywi be pleased to trnsmit the same to Her Most Gracious Majesty.' A similar meeting was held at Glamorgan, Tasmania, at whlich the following resolutions were passed: "That itis the opinion of this meeting that the proceedings of his Excellency the Governor and Executive Council, since the last meeting-of the Legislative Assembly, have been rash, hasty, and unconstitutional, in thwvarting the endeavours of the select committee in the investigation of the convict department for the gross neglect charged against it, even to enormous loss of life. "That this meetin' is of opinion that the antagonistic position in wh ch the Executive and Ieislature are placed with regard to the mode of carrying out the inquiry into the abuses existing in the Imperial Convict Department *is detrimental to the interests and welfare of the community, and calculated to impair that confidence in, and respect for, the legislative and executive bodies which are essential to the peace and good government of the colony. That, regarding the,presence of any Imperial department having interests conflicting with those of the colony, and administered by officers not under the control of the local Legislature, as utterly incompatible -with the beneficial existence of free institutions, this mleeting is of opinion that the Executive and Legislature should strenuou_ly urge upon the Imperial Government the absolute necessity of at once transferring the control of the Imperial convict department to the local Legislature, the Imperial Government repayingto the colonial treasUrY the cost accruing to the colony from the presence of Imperial convicts until the anne shall have become- free, and cease to be Scharge on the colonial revenue. That this meeting is further of opinion that the examination of Dr. Hampton or any of his department at the bar of the House is not indispensable, or even necessary, to the efficient prosecution of the inquiry into the abuses committed by those officials; and that such inquiry should be conducted in a manner which will not necessitate a renewal of the collision with the Executive at the re-assembling of the Legislative Council, at which time this meeting is of opinion the representatives will best serve the ioterests of their consttuents and the welfare of the community generally by proceeding with the many important measures now before the Council, more especially that of bringing into operation the new constitution. *' That it is the opinion of this meeting that the course which has been pursued by the majority of the Council is at the same time constitutional, temperate, and requisite for the due maintenance of the rights, hberties, and privileges of the inhabitants, not only of this colony, but of the wvole of the dependencies of Great Britain." Accoimts from the Ovens report a very large yield of gold. A lump of 11b. weight had been picked up by a miner, and one party took out in a week liOlb. weight.

THE POISONINGS AT TANOCHESTER. Mr. Bradlaugh, of London, is still pursuing his investi tion of the charge against Dunn, Monaghan, and Barry, for poisoning Monaghan's father, and proper steps have been taken to obtain the exhumation of Monaghan s body, that it may. be subjected to a post mortees examination. The search for the body, however, has so far proved abortive. He was buried in the 'ground attachedc to St. W1lfred's Catholic Chape, Hulme, which, though only a comparatively new place of sepulture, is sufficiently crowded to throw many obstacles in the way of the search. On Thursday it is said that upwards of a dozen bodies had been removed without finding the right one, nor had the search been more successful up to a late hour yesterday. In the examination of Mr. Holland, surgeon, on Wednesday, some portions of his evidence were rejectedcby the Court, because one of the accused parties (Dunn) was not present, statements criminatingan absentpersonnotbeing admissible undersuch circumstances. The evidence so excluded was to the effect tliat Dunn had said that the monthly payments were made in shares, and that it was agreed, when the money should be obtained from the Diadem Assurance Company, they (meaning James Monaghan, George Barry, and Min" himsell) should "hook it" to Australia. When -the prisoner James Monaghan and Dunn went together to Mr. Holland's house, Monaghan was dressed in black, and on the occasion, according to the evidence of Mr. Holland, when he first heard from James Monaghan of his father's death, they both said that dysentery had caused his death. Mr. Holland asked James Monaghan to "prove it," and he produced a certificate signed by Mr. Hatton, surgeon, stating the cause of death to be "chronic dysentery." This, Mr. Holland thought, would be about September. At this point Mr. Bradlaugh asked, " What did he say had been given to hime' The witness replied, "Dunn said he had given a few grains of acetate of lead to hiu." This was said in the surgery; and James Monaghan vwas-in the parlour at the time. 'Dunn also said afterwards, in the presence of Monaghan, that a glass of whisky was given to John Monaghan when he was upstairs; but the witness did not think that the prisoner James Monaghan heardthis, or that James Monaghan said anything about it.' Question.-n your oath, did James Monaghan say anything to you about what was done in the bedroom? -Answer.-He said there had been a glass of whisky given to old Monaghan; and Dunn corroborated it. He said they had given him a glass of whisky, and Monanhan said that they had dosed it; but I don't think he i-ew there was anything in it. The witness's reason for thinking so was that Monaghan never mentioned it. The wituess had a book called the 3fcdical .lAt'manac. It contained a description of all kinds of poisons. He never showed it to James Monaghan. He had sho,n it to Dunn once. James Monaghan was not there then; and the witness and Dunn were all who were in the place. The witness thought at the time Dunn had a lag dog ho wanted to do somethigvwith. He thoughtso be cause Dunn's vwife had been bitten by a do-" and she herself bad stated that she would poison it. T'his the witness thought was towards the latter end of the'year. Mr. Bradlaugh, we may add, is still continuing his investigation of the case.
MJrTE-ExETE Thrursday.-The Exeter polcehave to-day apprehended a woman, named Mary c-eeks, on suspicion of having murdered her son. It appears that a few days ago the body of a fine boy, aged about 4 years, was found in the Exe river, nearStarcross. A black apron was tied tightly round its face and head, and there were indications that the poor child had been foully murdered. Information was forwarded to the Secretary of State, who immediately offered a reward of aOl. to any person who would give information about the child. During the past week a person residing in Exeter has communicated with the police, and the result is that the 'woman Weeks, who left Exeter yesterday for Plymouth, has been apprehended. She appears to have lived as servant in two or three publichoussa in the city, and had an illegitimate child of the same age and havinc slinihar appearances as the murdered boy. The cluld was kept by a person in Exe-lane untiil a few days ago, when, mn consequence of her refusal to keep it any longer, Weeks came and took herboyaway, and said she should send it home to her mother, who resides at Sticklepath, near Okchampton. One night at 9 o'clock a woman resembling the prisoner was seen, apparently weeping, standing near the river Exe, and a child's frock and another article of wearing apparel were subsequently found near the spot. It is thlerefore suspected that the poor boy was thrown into the river Exe, at Exeter, and that the black apron was tied round its face and head to prevent its making any alarm and to facilitate its death, and that the body was carried down by the current to the spot near Staroross where it was discovered.

The Chalmers andWideawake sailing transports went into Portsmouth harbour from Spithead yesterday to dis. charge fittings, &c.,'andbe paid out of the service. The Bucephalus transport, lying off the Arsenel wharf at Woolwich, yesterday broke from her moorings, in consequence of -the heavy weather in the river, and carried away the bowsprit of the gunboat Dove, but without effecting any other damage. A heavily-laden barge was blown under the. piles of the newly-erected pier and sunk. - Five 68-pounder guns, weighing 95 cwt. each, were yesterday shipped, with their carriages, on board the Little Ben, one of the Ordnance schooners, at Woolwich, for the purpose of being conveyed to Sheerness. These guns complete the requisite number of 14, which constitute the equipiAentof the floating battery Thunder. The following warrant has been sent to offies con dna-- ing reginents, the object of it being to grant to recraits of the army a kit on joining the service:- "VzICTORIA R. "Whereas, under our regulations and orders for the, army, it is prescribed that a recruit, upon being finally apjproved, shall receive as bounty a sum of money in cash and necessaries; and whereas it has been represented to ns that it will be e.xpedient that the recruit should receive his boanty in cash, and should on binl approval be supplied with necessaries at the public expense: our will and adeasure is, that on and after the 31st day of January, lSSb, allrecruits enlisting in our army shall receive gratuitously a stock of necessaries from the stores of the Director-General of Ary Clothing, wthich shall be kept up by the soldier at his own expense, under the present or sach other regulations as may be determined upon by one of our principal Secretaries of State and our Commander-in-Chief. "The articles to be supplied to every soldier who enters our army are detailed in the inclosed statement, which comprises every article of necessari'e required for soldiers of all branches of our army. "Given at our Court at St. Jiumes's this 22d day of January, 1856, in the 19th year of our reign. " By Her Majesty's command, , ANMIIE." The warrant then enumerates the articles of necessaries allowed-for Artillery, Sappers and Miners, Heavy and Light Cavalry, the Guards, regiments of the Line not being Highland regiments, Cape Mounted Biflemen, and, lastly, Highland regiments. In consequence of this Royal warrant the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief has issued the following circular:- "Horse Guards, Jan. 2$ "The Field-Mfarshal Commanding-in-Chief, with the sanction of the Secretary of State for War, is pleased to direct that that part of the bounty for recruits which relates to stoppages for the supply of necessaries, on final approval, shall abolished, and that the recruit shaU hereafter be entitled fo receive in money the actual sum specified as bounty. " It is also intended to supply him with a complete kit at the public expense. "TUnder this arrangement it becomes necessary to equalize the bounty. Although the cavalry and artillery recruits received a higher rate, the apparent difference was absorbed in the cost or additional artic es of eguipment not required by the infantry soldier. Those articles will in future be furnished by the Government. "3uring the war the scale of bounty for cavalry, artlery, and infantry wrill be as follows-viz . *On attesting . . £0 5 0 On intermediate approval ... ... 0 15 0 On fmal approval .. .. .. ..4 0 0 Total bounty ... ... £ 0 O "This new distribution of a soldier's bounty will enable him to remitaliberal sum tohisfamily, or to depositmoney inthc savings'-bank, to facilitate which the Secretary of state for W'ar will cause ample instructions to bogiven; and the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief is confident that recruits will take advantage of the opportunity to benefit themselves by providing for the future, or of affording that temporary assistance to their parents which many of them have already shown an earnest desire to do. " Volunteers from the embodied Militia, on extending their services to the line, will receive 11. on being attested; and as they are considered fit for duty a further sum of 5L. on final approal will be allowed them, ;makng in all a bounty of ft. and kit complete.

Pursuant to a resolution of the Dablin TownCouncil, the Baldoyle corporation estate was yesterday offered in lots by public auction for a tenancy of 31 years-the Lords of the Treasury having by letter intimated that under any circumstances no longer tenure could be granted. The biddings were taken per the statute acre, the highest bidder in every mase to be declared the purchaser, subject to the approbation of the town-council-rent to be charged from the time the tenant was put into possession, and the last half-year's rent to be paid in advance. The prices brought by the several lots varied from 31. Us., the lowest, to 41. 10s. the statute 'acre, excluding lot No. 1, which brought 61.7s. 6d. These rents are fully up to the present high standard. Seven of the ten lots put up were let, and :the; re3maining 'three withdrawn, from the insufliciency of the biddng,s. The town of Baldoyle and the ad- ioining portions of the estate still remain to be sold. it is estimated that, when the entire property has been let, it wrill yield an increased revenue of nearly 2,000l. amnually. HE GOVERNMENT PROVISION CONTRACT. The Cork contractors are, it seems, highly displeased at the stringency of the terms imposed upon them by the Admiralty, and at the extreme minut& ness of the mpection of the provisions delivered at Iawlboline. Both combined, they complain, make fu"lfilmnent impossible. THE IISH CORN TRADE. Accounts from Cork mention thatthe corn-market held on Wednesday exhibited symptoms of greater firmness, but quotations remain unaltered. It is stated that large stocks of Indian corn, between 35,000 and 40,000 tons, are at present held on ac-- count in the city, besides considerable quantities of other grain, but the amount in store of sweet foreign wheat is believed to be small. Large quantities of grain are also understood to be held in most of the western ports. TRSSATLANTIC CO3UNICATION. It is all but officially announced that Mr. Malcolmson, of Portlaw, Waterford, the eminent steamship proprietor, is about to place a line of screw steamers betweenLiverpool and New York, touching at Queenstown on the outward and home voyages.

MANSIATGHTR ON THE HIGH SEAS.-AI inqiueAt was hld before the borongh coronerof Liverpool on Tiurs. day on the body of William Henry Barnes, a seaman on board the American ship Driver. It appeared that about a- fortnight ago, as the vessel was making for the port of Liverpool, the deceased quarrelled with a boy named Peter Conley, whom he brntanly beat and kicked, whereupon Conley drewv a knife and stabbed him in the abdomen. - -When the vessel.ved at Liverpool the wounded man was taken to the Northern Honits. where he died on Wednes- day. A verdict of "Manalanghter" was returned'against Coaley, who was comomitted for trial.
THRE AfETBOPOLITAf BOA,j OF WORKS. __h Ysterday,'at 12 o'clock, the, treopoltanBoard of Works net f6r the transaction -.r business in the Council Chamber, GruldhaU, wbich .s for the present been conceded for their uise and accomnodation by the Common Council of the city of london, Mr. Thwaites, the president, occnpled the chair. There was a full: 'attendance of the members, and the public were present in so large a nv.umber that the space appointed for their occnation was inadequate, and the board assigned to theme the whole of theoseats below the gangway at the foot of the ehanmber. THE DUTIES OF CoSmTES. On the motion of Mr. DIXON, seconded by Mr. OFFO73, an elaborate digest, presented by the chairman of the Metro- pus Local Management Act, sO far as it relates to the duties andfuctons of commnittees to} be appointed by the board for carrying into execution m;any of the provisions of tBhe sdtatute, WaS ordered to be sent- to each of the district THE PBESnID-ND 'rUE PRES. The PRESEN-T said, there was a matter personal to himself to which for a mornent he wished to direct the attention of the board. Certain articles had appeared in some of the public prints, in which an unwarrantable use had been made 'of his name (hear, hear), and lie was desirous to state that which it was probably unnecessary for him to state, that he knew nothing whatever of the wnters of those articles. He thought they had taken a most unwarrantable liberty with his name, and he repudiated them. (Hear, hear.) -He would only further say that such publications would have no effect whatever urn his public conduct at that board, or cause hm to de-nate one iota frorm that strict line of duty -which he had marked out for himself in the responsible and honourable position to which he had been caUed by the suffages of the beard. (Cheers.) ELECION OF ENGiEER TO THE EOARD. Previous to entering upon the election of the engineer to the board, which was the principal business of the day, a discussion ensued upon the motion of Mr. loiman Taylor, seconded by Mr. Hal, for suspending the business wlhich stood on the programme before the election, in order to proceed at once -with the consideration of the appointment of engineer. T'he motion was opposed by Major Lyon, Mr. Doulton, and Mr. D'Iffanger, who deprecated the undue haste shown by a part of the members to proceed with an election which ought only to-be made after the utmost deliberation, and the impropriety of departing for that purpose from the regular order of the business of the day. Mr. CoLia;soN contended that if the board elected their engineer that day they would be committing themselves to the adoption of a particular system of sewerage, and cautioned them against precipitation in so important a matter. IHe moved an amendment, -which was seconded by Mfr. Hows, that the order of business should not be departed from. Mr. Deputy HARRISON said, the mover and seconder of the amendment had indicated but too dlearly the course of proceeding they intended to adopt in reference to tho election in question; and he would only observe that if the board did not elect their engieer until the great pipe and tunnel controversy was settled, they wc-ald be without an engiueer for the next seven years. (A laugh.) The resident had referred to the improper liberty which abeen taken with his name by certain anonvuus writers in some part of the public press. A similar liberty had been taken with himself; but he (Deputy Harrison) hoped he should outlive the slander of which he had been made the object, uniustashefeltittobe. Hesoughtonlytobeusefultohis fellow-citizens, and if on that occasion or any other he should so far forget what was due to himself and them as to be a party to jobbery of any kind, he should sacrifice everything he held dear, and be no longer worthy of a seat at that board. (Cheers.) Mr. BRIsTowx ridiculed the notion that in electing the engineer they would be in any way whatever commnitting themselves to any particular scheme of drainage, or that in so doing they would be choosig a dictator, as some members seemed to apprehend. (HIear, hear.) The motion of Mr. Tylorwas carried on a show of hands, and the beard at once proceeded with the election. MNr. WOORRYCH, the Secretary, read the list of candidates for the appointment-Mr. J. W. Bazalgette, 1, Greekstreet, iSoho; MIr. R. liawlinson, 34, Parliament-street- Mr Thomas Cox, Croydon; Mr. David . eRy, herone b en: gineer, Wolverhampton* Mr. W. Y. Freebody, 9, Dukestreet, Westiunster; iudt Richard Dixon, Rotherham, Yorkshire; Mr. J. A. 32In, 14, Chatham-nlace, Blackfriars; Mr W.Tregoe, 1, Chelsea-villas (West7, Brompten; and ar. Booths. On the motion of Mr. L. Taonor, seconded by Mr. ThSnere, it was resolved that the number of candidates shougld be reduced to the four who, on a show of hands, should be found to have the highest number of votes;and en the names being put to the vote the choice fell on Mr. Bazalgette, who hadi 32 votes; MEr. Henry, who had 23;Mr. Rawlinson, 16; and Mr. Boothe, 12. The applications for the appointment were then read by the Secretary. Mr. Basalgetts stated that he bad been regularly educated to the profession of an engineer, and had for 20 years been actively engaged upon large and publeo works of a varied nature. Previously to his connexion with the Metropolitan Comumssion of Sewers he acted as resident engineer to the Tame Valley Canal, where he constructed a large number of locks, bridges, and heavy earthworks. He was also engaged upon extensive works in Portsmouth D}ockyard; in embanking and reclaiming lands from the sea in Ireland-in the improvemnent of the navigable channels of 'rivers-the construction of railways, and other works. In 1848 he was appointed upon the engineering staff of the Metropolitan Conmigsion of Sewers; and for the last three years he had held the responsible position of chief engineer to that commission, and he referred with confidence to the sewerageworks executedunder hissuperintendence, amounting in value to 500,0001. sterling, as giving the best indication of his special knowledge of the state of the metropolitan sewerage, and of the peculiar requirements of the service. Mr. Bazalgette's application was accolpanied by testi'monials from Mr. Robert Stephenson, Mr. L M runel, Sir W. Cubitt, Mr. Philip Bardvicl-, Mr. James Simson, Mr. G. P. Bidder, Mr. J. IL Rendel, Mr. John Hawkshaw Mlr. T. Hawksley, and other. eminent engineers and architects. The application of Mr. Rawlinson related his professional history during 27 years in much detailoriginally as a builder, and afterwards in the construction of the extensive docks at Liverpool under Mr. Jesse Hartley; in the capacity of assistant-surveyor of the Liverpool corporation ; in the drainage of several large towns in the kingdom under theLocal Board of Health Act; and, lastly, as a member of the commission sent out to the Crimea by the Government, to assist in devising and executing measures for improving the sanitary condition of the camp, and also of the hospitals at Scutari hir. Henry's application stated that, not being personally known to any member of the board, he rested his claim to their suffrages entirely on the principle of qualfication, arising from experience, fitness, and capacity, so emphatically recognized and adoptedat all their meetings. He at present filled the office of bhro eneer and surveyor to the Local Board of Health inWolverhampten,one of the most important and densely populated towns in the kingdom, and had just designed a complete system of sewerage which had received the unqualified approv of those who, by their scientific attainments and research, were regarded as among the most enlghtened supporters of the sanitary movement In preparing the report end numerous drawings by which hesonghttoelucidateand develops that system, he had been gaided not merely by ingenious theories, bat by close and practical observations, ivolving incessant personal labour and experience, which emboldened him to thnk he was especially quahlied for the office he now sought. He added that, when elected to his present office, he was an utter stranger in Wolverhampton, and obtained the appointment purely on the strength of his testimonials, with regard to sengeering qualifications, from Sir John Burgoyne and other eminent persons. This gentleman's application was fortified by extracts from various reports made by the muncipal authorities at Wolverhampten, in which he was highly complimented for his great professional sldll and the excellent practical advice he had afforded them from time to time. Mr. .NICHOuTY said, he had to state that since he left home that morning he had received a letter containing most serious and extraordinary charges against one of the candidates for the office of engieer to the board. It was not an anonymous letter, orhe would have treated it with the contempt which it deserved; but it was from a gentleman who gave his name, and who called upon him (Mr. Nicholay) as an independent member of this board-he did not know why he had been so designated-to bring it under the consideration of the meeting. He (Mr. Nicholay) felt it his duty to comply with that request, as an act of Ijustice to the candidate in question, in order that he might have an opportunity of making any answer he thought necessary to the charges which the writer of the letter had brought agamist him. With the permission of the board Mr. Nicholay read an extract from the letter in question, as follows:- " lMr. Bazalgette, one of the candidates for the ensineership to the board, states in his printed application or the post that he acted as resident engineer on the Tame Valley Canal, and there constructed a large number of locks, bridges, and heavy earthworks. It appears, however, on inquiry at the canalcompany's office inBirmingham, that Mr. Bazalgette was not resident engineer on the Tame Valey Canal, auddidnot constructthelocks,bridges,andheavyeaxthworks of that canal; but that a Mr. Holland was resident engineer at the commencement of the canal in 1841, and, after him, a Mr. Horn was resident engineer till the completion of the canal-in 843, MIr. Bazalgette being one of five subordinates under the resident engineer. The engineers-in-chief were Messrs. Walker andurgess, from whose office confirmation ofthe above facts has been: obtained. M!fr. Bazalgette further states, in his circular, that he was 'engaged upon extensive works in Portsmouth Dockyard,' but, upon inquiring at the Admiralty and at Portsmouth Dockyard, it appears that Mr. Bazalgette's only engagement there was as a draughtsman on probation, during four months in 1842, at 5s. per diem pay." The writer added that he conceived it to be his duty; on public grounds, to place in M1r. Nicholay's hands those fhcts, with liberty, should he think fit, to bring them before his colle^gues an the boa,rdL.,. .- 1r. li. TALwOR asked-if the writer of the letter was per. sonally known to Mr. Nieholay. MIr. NICHOLAY said, he had no personal intimacy with the gentleman, bat he had seen him, andl had heard much of him in public. (Cries of "Name 1") He had no desireh whatevertoconceal thename ofthe,writer. Theletterwas signed "F. 0. Ward."l (Oh, oh I") r. L. TAYLORt said, the board would never have had the letter read if MIr. licholay had given the name of the writer of it beforehand. He wondered Afx. Nicholay read such a letter from such a man. - (Hear, heat.) Mfr. NIcuorxY said, he was no advocate of Mrr. Ward. The letterin question had been addressed to him in Isis capacity of a member of this board, by a member of the-late Comnnission of Sewers, well acquainted, he presumed; -with Mr. Bazalgette, and he thoughthe could not do otherwise than bring it under the considerationof the board.,- (gear, bear.)- - - Mr. TAYLOR said, there was nothing in the letter tlatrequired an answer from Mr. BaxlAgette. (" Oh oh V) The fact was, his friend (Mr. Nicholay) had discovered a mare's nest, and the thing was too ridiculous for the' 'boardl to entertain-it for a moment. , Mr. DouVL oxr submitted that the letter *a' unot'a thug to be sdfled in the wav in which Mr. Taylorwishedtodisoe of it. It washa question wich affeted the honour and cbs raster ef the had, -The statements put forward in ti letter awte plain and intelgible, and he was astonished to bear f. Taylor say thei&ewas nothiings it vflfcVcaIlled-for an answer fromllr. Banlgett. (HEear, hear.) On the motion of -tMr. -SAVAG;, each of the four candi.dates.vas ullowed to address the board- 1 Mr. BAZALGETE did Eo first, and related his expeneeas an engineer in much the same terms set forth in his writn application, of which an abstract has alredbeenygiveni I rply to the charge of Mr. Ward, he stated that one-balf of ithe engineer's work involved in the construction of theTmne Valley Canal was done underhis imnediatesu tenaee, and the other half underthat of Mr. Holland; and that he (Mr. Bazilgette) constructed 13 of the locks. on the canal, and many other heavy worms He admitted he had sme years go held a comparatively humble situation in Ports - mouth Dockyard, which be had purposely accepted in order to gain that experience in his profession wichebad since been of immense service to him. In that positionhe was engaged inpreparlng plans and supenintending works in the dockyard, but not as a draughtsman, as mr. Ward had alleged. He added that for the last siL years and a-hia the whole of his timeandattentionhadbeendevotedtothepracical study of the vast subterranean system of sewers in this metropols, 350 miles of which he had constracted, and iot a sigle sewer which he had constructed had failed. - MIIr. Eawbuson and Mr. Henry also briefly addressed the board inmtheir turnin explanation of their experience as engineer the former gentlemn- being interrogated at some length by Major Lyon and Mlr. Hunt in reference to the success or otherwise of some of the dra orks in large towns which had been zonstructed inder amioes. Mr. Boothe said, he had come forward as a candidate, not so mucch in the hope of being elected, as with the view of bringing under the consideration of the board a particular system of sewerage, in perfecting which he had devoted much time and attention. He was proceeding to develope his plans when the PxlErsnm- reminded him that this- was not the proper occasion to do so. Several of the members asked bin what works be had constructed in accordance with his plan ? He repliedl thaLt when Wheatetone invented his electric telegraph he could refer to no precedents in proof of its value, nor could Brindley when he projected his system of canals. He was precisely in the samne position. Mr. Dourrox complained, with some warmth, that Mr. Bazalgette had not given a satisfactory answer to the specific charges brought against him by Mr. Ward. Mr. gette had also stated in his circular that in 1848 he was appointed upon the engineering staff of the Metropolitan Commission of Sewrers; but he({Mr. Doalton) found, ton reference to the records of that comm;ission, that Mr tagalsette was, in 1849, a year later, acting in the capacity of surveyor and inlspector of nuisances to the commus- Mr. Husr ea Iland that discrepancy by stating that aboutrS o 1u9 there was a discussion in the Court of Sewers as to whether the engineers under the commission should be called engineers or surveyors. Mr. BAZAGETE was recalled and reiterated the statement in his printed circular, that he was appointed on the engineering staff of the commission in 1848, to the best of his belief. Mx. ]YIfry,uxGsn suggested that,- as it was highly desirable that the board should be as udnanious as possble in the election of so important an officer as their engineer, that unaimnitymight be attained by the retirement of Mr. Ilawlinson from the contest, ("Oh loh l") The PRms.mn- said, the sulggestion. of the hou.member was onewhichthe board could not entertain. Thev had four candidates before them, and they must discharge their duty by electing one of them. The names of each of the candidates were then submitted to a show of hands, when there appeared for Mr. Bandette 31 votes, for M1r. Henry 15, for M1r. Rlawlinson 12, and for Mr. Boothe L Mr. Boothe was, therefore, struck off the lit and on the second show the numbers were-for Mr. Bazalgette 32, for Mr. Heny 12, and for Mr. Rawlinson 10. The lastnamed gentteman then retired; and on the third p oIl the numbers were-for Mr. Baalgette 37, and for Mr. Henry none, the friends of the latter feeling it useless to vote twhtere the majority was so decidedly in favour of Mr. The PsSmmEN-r put the formal motion, that Mr. Bazalgette be the engineer to the board, when 39 of the members voted in his favour, and the election therefore fell upon him. ELECTION 'OP ACCOUNTANT. The hoard then proceeded to the election of an accountant, for which appointment there were 44 candidates. The lumbers were eventually reduced to four-namely, Mr. G. S. Hatton, the accountant to the late Commission of Sewers, Mfr. Kingsford, MIr. Buckton, and Mffr. Dover. Mr. Hatton was elected by a large majority. COAlfT1rEES OF TEE OARD. On the motion of Mr. Deputy HanRisox, seconded by Mr. Cosax-son, it was resolved,- " That on Monday next the whole board should resolve itself into a committee to take into consideration the appointment of the following committees.-L To hear and determine appeals. 2. For finauial purposes, 3. To consider bylaws:. 4. To confer with vestries and district eards. 5. To report on duties of the board under the Building Act; and, 6, to examine and report on claims for compensation." THE SUBORI)TATE OFFICEs. On the motion of M-. Deputy HnuRIson, it was referred to the committee on the dukes and salaries of officers, to consider and report what clerks and other officers should be appointed in the departmeots of the clerl, engineer, and accountant, and what salaries should be assignedto each. At the instance of Mr. DouLTos, Mr. Davis, Mr. Savage, and Mtr. Atkins were added to the committee. THE TREASURE: AND SUPERIN-SMM ARCHrIsTE Mr. TumEi3r brought up the report of the committee a; to the appoitieat of the treasurer, which recommended that the Bank of London be chosen for that office, the offer made by that establishment having been considered by the committee as most favourable to the beard. The report also defined the duties of the superintending architect, and recommended that his salary should be 800l. a-year. The report was received, and, on the motion of Mr. TUNsE, so murch of it as went to iecommend the appointment of the Bank of London as treasurer, and to define the duties of the superintending architect and his salary, was adopted. It was also resolved that the security required from that bank should be 50,0001. ; that the board meet on Monday week at 12 o'clock, to elect the superintendent architect, and that applications for the office be received until the previous Saturday. Mr. HxWxsS brought up the report from the committee as to plans for a board-room. WIDTH OF STRETS AND ALLEyS. The bylaw regulating the width of streets and alleys made by the board on the 18th inst., and given at length in this joumnal on the following day, was confinned, on the motion of Major LYoN, with a modification as to the penalty. On the motion of MIr. Ftw, it was resolved that the Registrar of Public Health in the metropolis be requested to send to each member of the board a copy of his reports as issed. The board, after sitting nearly six hours, adjourned to Friday next, at 12 oeclock.

The programme was good, but not quite so intersting and not quite so udiciously varied as at tho firt corcert Madame Golaschmidts ihare of it wss mnore labo. nious and taxing, but less generally effective. Nor did she, at the outset, seem altogether so well in voice a befor4although, as frequently happes with her, this. -mpresion entirely wore off as she wanned.into energy wit her singing. Her first piece, the slow' " Rondo !' for voice and violin oabigauo ( Be Pagrore) of Xozart was rather carefNUlly studied performance than one of genuine and graceful expression. The intonation was not so invariably faultless in this a5 is genexally the case vita Madame Goldschmidt, even in passages where the greatest sdatinig power is demAnded; and there was, from beginni6 to end, a certain heanine an-d absence of spontaneity. ln the next meorceau, -howejer the gifted lady took a signpal revenge. Thii was the great sccna of Agatha, from Der retiutz A. moresplendid displayof dramatic singing has arelybeen listened to. The stage situation, with all its exciting acces. sories, vas vividly conjured up by the eloquence of the songstress, who, carried away by her own enthusiasm, appeared to forget that she was in a concert-room, and sang with as much fervour, earnestness, and "lafser aller" as she could possibly, umder any cirumstances, have exhibited beforo the footlights. Genius was declared in every accent, phrase, and impulse. The audience could not fail to be moved by such a demonstration of ski,such a power of portraying tho most changeful and passionate emotions through the medium of the voice; and the applause was, as our Parisian friendsdenominateit, "fr2lntfiquc." In anotherstyle,the well-known recitative and iario of Amina, from the Sonndao buau-" Come per me sereno"-was a performiace of scarcely less consummate excellence, though, if we may be - llowed'so to express ourselves, the music of BeHini is not so absolutely homogeneous to the nature and idiosyneraof the Swvedish vocalist asthat of her nearer of kin, Carl Maria Von Weber. Nevertheless, how greatly she excel, in this k-ind of vocal exercise those -who remember her at Mr. Lumley's theatre in the Laymarket cannot have forgotten.- last night Mradame Goldschmidt sang the caratina of the innocent and joyous village maiden with as much facility, as prodigioas a command of voice, and a sentiment as deep and well imagined as ever did Jenny Lind of seven years sice. Whether her cadenzas and joriturc should be criticized as too ornate, too elaborate, not always in the strictest taste, nor always finiLedtothe t tmost nicety, we are unprepared. to say. What they are now, however, they wer then, and, take them for all in al, their lrre sistible charm is undeniable. They may not belong precisely to the Italian school of vocalzation; but they, belong to the schoolof JennyLid-a school which, with ll its faults (asByron has said, somewhere, of oneof the. poems of Scott) "cannot be imitated, because it is mimmitable." In short " Come per me sereno " was, thoutgh in, every s opposed, a worthy pendant to Agathas sccna ; and if we wished to name some special beauty to distinguish it (apart from its general tone of feeling) from other per-. formances of the same familiar composition, wemiight point with confidence to the artfully managed gradation, from mca socetofortc, in the last brilliant passage of the coda, which we have never heard attempted by any singer except Madame Goldschmidt, and which we mnch doubt iI any singer but herself could accomplish. The "Bird Songe of Taubert (in English), and thle "Herdsman's Song," a Swedish melody (iu the original. tongue), completed the performances of Madame Gold. schmidt. The first, besides beingexpressed vith natural aad, delightful archness, was amarvellous piece of execution. B3ut the imitations of the wild unmeasured utterances of thbe feathered tribes were much too frequent and redundant, while the abuse of sustained notes (" sons Jfds), from loud to soft, and eice versd, together with the exagerated ap. plication of the lengthened tri-jo, was, it is our duty to insist, unworthy of an artist. so magnificently endowed as Madame Goldschmidt, andwith auditors of taste anda efine. ment mnst in some measure have defeated their ownobject. In a far greater degree, however, theobjection appliedtothe"Herdsman's Song," where the counterfeit (by meas of two muffled head notes, that we thought would never cease), of the distant and gradually receding sound of the cowboy's. horn (we presume) must have made the judicious grieve. A little of this harmless pleasantry is chaming enough in its way at the end of a long concert; but, carried to such an excess, it borders upon caricature. It is certaily not sing- ing. One simple ballad, like "John Anderson my Joe" or" Ald llohin Grey," 'which Madame Goldschmidt warblesto such perfection, would have been worth a dozen such. displays of eccentric vocalism-although, itmust boobserved that the song of Taubert and the national Swedishl melody are both very pretty things of their class, and, when their characterLstc effects are not overdone, must always beacceptable from the lips of such a singer. At the same time,. let us bear -witness to the uproarious applause which followeed at the end of the 'Bird SongY That of the Herds-- man did not taLe so Indly. Was it that the "flcd7le" had. been detected? Hlerr Otto Goldscbmidt performed Mendelssohn's piano-- forte concerto in G minor with a vast deal of animation, but. scarcely with sufficient delicacy at times. He also intro-- duced tvo very clever " studies" of his own composition (in 1) flat and A minor), which could hardly have been played. with greater spirit and exactness. He was much applauded, Herr Deichmann (who was intrusted with the obligatoin Mozarts " Rondo") performed De Beriots 9th Air Vari! for the violin; and the programme was further enriched by "adamina" and Larg' o al factotum," both carefullysung by Signor F. Lablache. Mr. Benedict conducted with his accustomed talent; and the band played the over-- tures to Weber's Obcro,z and Spontini's Vcsfale-the firstall geuius, the last all emptiness.

The coroner said he filly concurred in theverdict. ST. SAvroun's, SoTwARxs-There are manyinteresting things in Sudirerche, the South-worl of London, but none so much so as St. Saviour's, the church of the- riory of St. Mary Overy, notwithstanding the treatment itha received. It has a nave, transept, choir, and Lady Chapel, with a lofty tower at the intersecton of the trand sept. The Lady Chapel, choir, transept, and tower were, restored some years ago, partly under Mdr. George Gwilt-and partly under Mr. Wallace; but the nave, left for a timewithout a roof, was taken down and rebuilt in most incongruous and ugly fashion. The church, of which portions. remain, was commenced in 120S, and these show how fine a. specimen of the early English style it was. The proportions of the original nave were pleasant to loolk at, and some of the sculptures were of much interest. With care, and someewenditure, the ancient nave might have been restored; and this church, which inly surps in the tbay Wetomintster tAbwe andeSt aciuel'tos,igta hav beenm preserved intact for muttre generations. However, the old ave was removed, the present struct ore erected on its site and certan mlbertes taken with the trnsept of the curch.o These Gnalersant additions consist of large ladder-like, unsightly staircasesp large galleries, and vooden pa*aition which so clog up -and disfigure The fine proportions of the transept, destroy the view from the choir, and ar so con trary to good tae, thatwe feellirl.inedto state cut nohingt so bad is to beinetwaith in London, and that is saying a either b the architectural stued nt,byis those cuious inb oW matters. Thereis an intereisting monument to the date 1ow0, the bunisa of E camond Shakstbare, planer in tho church."

THE SrATuE OF CEARFEs L AT CAnii-G Ross. -The great object of, what was done to King Charles's statue was security. It had. origially been fixed to a slab of black marble, which had become fractured, and been pieced with Portland stone. - Sir Francis Chantrey had some measures taken afew years baclk for its greater secu zity, but it was thought advisable recently to do something 'more decided. Accordingly under the direction of W. Scott, the shattered slab as been taken out, and one of granite, a trifle thicker, inserted, first securng the stones which form the cornice by the Insertion Oflt ope chain bound all romd it below the granite slab. The sb itself iss1;eoured to the pedeta by copper bolts running into the sztonework below, and the feet of the hors are siiiaruly secured to.the slab. As one foot is raised, the Centre Of gravity is very mauchon one side of tho supports,- sothat there IS a decided train upon one of the feet, which were fornd to be -eery-insecure ly fastened. this has novw been effectualy remeied.
