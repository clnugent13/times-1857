This being Goo& Friday it was oberved as a, holyday, and the Bank, Stock-Exchange, and other places of public resort were closed.
The Bank of France returns for the past month, published this morning, are satisfactory,- but not monre so than 'had been anticipated. The bulliou shows an increase of 508,0001., the total being now'9,400,0001. There is also an increase of 563,0001. in the note circulation, of 432,0001. iu the deposits" and 700,0001. in the discounts. The Government; balance presents a decrease of 1,387,(001., btut, OD', ,the other hand, the advance of 1,600,0001. made by the Bank on Treasury Bonds has been paid ofL; There has been a alight sugmentation-160)000t.or the loans upon Rentes, but the small total out Pon]
railway securities has experienced a further reduction of 22,0001. The premium paid for artificial purichases of bullion during the month has been 16j0001., and it may therefore be presumed they have amounted to more than a million sterling.

Fall Of Five Houses And Loss Of Life.-
FALL OF Frvl HousEs AND Loss OF LlFr.- Yesterday morning, between 10 and 11 o'clock, some houses, which had been under repair in Bow-street, Covent-garden, sadden,ly fell down, and several workmen whho were engaged upon them at the time received serious injunris. One man, Morris Gibbon, was crushed to death, and another, Donald Shaen, had both his thighs broken, and was otherwise so much hurt that he is not expected to survive. Is appears that in Bow-street, Covent-garden, nearly facing the Police-court, had stood for nearly a century a number of small houses, forming the principal portion of what is termed Russell-place. These houses were two stories high, and flanked the back of the Albion Hotel in Russell-street, and two or three gublichouses in Bow-street. These houses had been allowed to get into a very dilapidated state, and, being surveyed by the j ry of tbecityof Westminsterand the offcial agent of the Bedford etate, it was deemed advisable that they should be pulled down. Consequently, for some time men have been employed in casting down the brickworkand removing the timoers of the buildings, which occupation they continued yesterilay morning, Themen commencedtheirdanoerouscing at the usual hour in the morning, and among those so employed were John Sheen, aged 40, of No 1, Middle Searlesplace, Temple-bar; Timothy Madden, aged 67. of Neal'spassage, Seven-dials; John Sheare, aged 34, of Eart-street, Covent-garden; Morris Gibbons, of 4, King-street, Drurylane;andChristopher MAnley. Themen had continued for ssme time at work, when those who were in the first-floor had their attention arrested byseeing the southern wall of one of the houses bulge forwards, They immediately called to their fellow-workmen to rmn for their lives, but before sufficient time had blapsed to do so the house in which the poor men were fell, causing the four adjoining to follow, burying four out of the five men in the ruins. The police, under the orders of Mr. Superintendent Darkin, immediately proceeded to the spot, and went actively to work to extricate the unfortunate men from the ruins. Although the police were exposed to the danger of Dosing their own lives by the continuous falling of briclks, they never relaxed their exertion, and in the poe of little more than half an hour they extricated four unfortunate persons from the rubbish. The sufferers were forthwith removed by the police to King's College Hospital, when, as above stated, it was found that Morris Gibbn had been crushed to *death, and that John Sheen had sustained a fractured skull. and that part of his jaw was so badly injured that, unon one of the bouse surgeons attempting to remove a broken tooth, a great portion of the jaw came away with it. This poor fellow also remains in a very dangerous state. Donald Shaen is between 30 ani 40 years of age, and it is stated has a wife and several children. The man named Titmothy Madden escaped with only a dislocation of the shoulder and trifling external injties, and nothing unfavounrable is apprebended inhis case. As is often the case in all fearful accidents, Hlanley, who stood in greater danger than any of the others, managed tojump away, with only a alight. sprain in the back.

Great Exhibition Of Art Treasures.
GREAT EXHIBITION OF ART TREASURES.
I (MOM O1JR our ooxpox...,
MAlCHESERB, &f4it 9.
The industrial metropolis 6f England has long been distinguished for its commercial and politicaL activity. It mauufactures cotton goods' fr every, nation under the sum, and it has effected a revolution in our fiscal policy. -But no one cver antici-- pated that to its other triumphs it would add that of being the first city in Britain to acknowledge in a fitting manner the claims of art. Yet so it is, and the E xhibition lof' Art Treasures, which is to be opened on the 5th of next month, promises to be 'as successful as the most thriving mill on the banks of the Irwell, or even as the League itself. The scheme, which has been conceived' and :'completed in less than e twelvemonth, is far more comprehensive than is generally supposed. While remarkable for the absence of that industrial element which formed the chief feature of the Great Vxhibition of 1851, and of which Manchester is so justly proud, it embraces within its seope all the objects that come under the denomination of fne arts classified and arranged in such a manner as to be pr'oductive of the greatest amount of pleasure and instruction. Galleries of ancient and modern paintings, a collection of portraits, numerous works of sCU ture, a general museum of art, courts of water colours, engravingz, photograpbs, and Oriental productions are included in the plan. One object is to illustrate in an effective and instructive manner English life in bygone tines; another, to exhibit a collection of portraits of persons eminent in British history; a third, to mark the progres of miniature painting; and a fouith to give a chronologicalthiltory of British art in its widest sense. About 900 pictures by ancient masters, the same number-of modern paintiDg, between_( O nd X40 portiailts 4200 miniatures, upwards of 1000 'water-colour drawings, a large and choice collectio'n ofengravings, the Bernal and Soulage collectios, and a multitude of articles in marble, alabaster, wood, ivory, and the precious metals, constitute an exhibition such as has never before been een in England. The National Gallery and Marlborough-house, it is true, contain soime noble pietaree, but the enormous amount of private treasures prevents their being considered national collections, while the obiects of art in the British Museum are spoiltanidegraded by the neighbourhoodof anass of worthless rubbish. According to Dr. Waagen, a competent authority, there are in Englan objects of art which exceed in interest and value those of any other country in the world.; but up to the present time they haave been distributed in private houses throughout the kingdom, unkInown and unseen by the public. To Manchester belongs the honour of collecting in one spot all the choiceest produetions of artistic genius which England possesses, and of erecting for their reeption and exhibition an edifice which is Itself a marvel of taste and skill. For the purposes of such an exhibition Mauchester appears to be, -without exception, or with the exception of the metropolis alone, the most suitable place that could have been selected. It is the eentre of a distriet teeming with a population exceeding that of London and Paris; it possesses railway facilities admirably adapted for bringing and returning visitors within one day to and from their own residences; and, above all, its leading inhabitants have the requisite, amount. of taste, energy, and -wealth. All classes, from the Queen downwards, have contributed to the success of the umdertaking. The works of art now in the building or on the way thither are of almost priceless value; and it is' impossible to estimate too highly the liberality of those-who have determined to gratify the publie at some inconvenience and risk to themselves. Many of the nobility and gentry, including nearly all the wealthiest and best known connoisseurs and collectors, have sent the flower of their galleries and museums, and it may truly. be said that almost every mansion-house in England has furnished its picture, its engraving, or its piece of carved work.
The Exhibition building is erected at OldTrafford, a western suburb of Manchester, about tw miles from the Exchange. It is constructed of iron, timber, and glass, and may be described as three glgantic tubes, placed side by side, each with a semicircular roof. The middle tube, which is much the largestefthethree, formsthegreateentralhall ornave, and the two smaller tubes picture gaUeries. There is a transept at the western end, where, too, is the only gallery in the building. Without going minutely into the construction of the palace, it may be stated that the outside walls are formed of a row of columns placed a few feet apart, the intervening spaces being filed with sheets of corrugated iron; and at the distance of 48 feet there is an inner row of columns separating the central hall from the picture galeries. A row of coupled iron columns, light and graceful in appearance, and connected at the top by the open girders which carry the roof of the central hall, runs the entire length of the building. The roof is covered with corrugated sheet iron, wth the exception of a broad strip at the top, which is glazed. Water is conveyed. down hollow columns into drains; and the ventilating arrangements are excellent. The articles exhibited will be thoroughly protected from fire, rain, and damp. Exteriorly the building has a very plain appearance. The faqade consits principally of a semicircle for the nave and two semicircles for the picture galleries, corresponding in their contour with the general section of the building, with wings extending a distance of 450 feet. It is white in colour, relieved with red brick, and the semicircular ends are fitted with ornamental fanlights and glazed. An ornamental entablature around the central areh bears upon it, in coloured letters, the inscription "Art Treasures of the United Kingdom." The ends of the transept are also formed with glazed faulighta. The decoration of the interior-a pointof prime importance-hasbeen designed and executed with exquisite taste. Gaudiness has been avoided, and the result is peculiarly chaste and pleasant. The columns inthe central hall are of bronze, their capitals being relieved with gold. Rosettes of the same material ornament the cornices, and the ribs of the ceiling are bronzed at the edges, the centre being white with a veUlum tint. The aides of the ribs are ornamented with scrolls of Vitravian and Grecian character, in white and red, the face being relieved with gold and light bronze. What are called the purlins of the roof are white marked with red lines, and the panels between the ribs are of an aerial gray, with maroon lines, showing the margin. The side walls of the central ha are of a rich maroon colour, while those of the side gaUeries are covered with paper of a neutral tea green tint-an admirable background for paintings. The roof decorations of the central haU are continued in the picture galleries, where there are a number of allegorical emblems, together with the names of great painters chronologicaUy arranged. The length of the buildingis 704feet, and its breadth 200. The central hall alone is 104 feet in width; it runs of course from end to end. The picture galleries are 432 feet in length, and 48 in breadth. it is calculated that the building will contain 40,000 persons without causing inconvenience. The cost will not be less than 80,0001. Such are the principal features of a building which, though it does not, as Mr. Fairbairn has stated, rival the Vatican in its stateliness and solidity, nor the Louvre in its gorgeous interior, is yet a casket not unworthy to hold the matchless gems of art which a few days will see collected within its waUls.
The arrangement of the collection is of course, a matter of the utmost importance. Without proper classification and order the Exhibition would lose more than half its value, even as a mere spectacle. A few words will suffice to eoxplain the distribuation of the exhibiting space. The walls of the central hail are to be covered with portraits, arranged chronologically, incltuding a gallery of Lancashire worthies. Some 20 cases, similar to those used in Marlborough-house, containing a miscellaneous collection of objects of art, will occupy the spaces between the pillars along a portion of the nave. The sculpture, armour, carvings, and a thousand other treisures of art which it is impossible to enumerate, will be placed in the great hall
which will be decorated with flags, flowers, ana trophies of various kinds. One of the aide saloons will be used as a gallery of ancient pictures, and the other will be devoted to the exhibition of modern paintings. Beyond the transept thero is a court for engravings, another for Oriental productions, and a third for the water-colour, drawings of emainent mnasters. The photographs wrill be exchibited in the gallery which runs round the west end of the building, where a large organ is in course of erection.
In the selectioii of a site for the Palace the Indis. pensable requisites of purity of atmnosphere antd faclity of acces' -hve not; been forgotten. The
building rises to the windward of the iountle3s chimneyo. pf anchter,. while there is railway communication from all pars ,f the count&to the very door of the Exhibfti6n. Vhe-S6uiith 3unction and Altrincham Railv4y runs by the south aide of the edifice, and' siding con4ecti it with a covered plitform, 800 feet in, 'rlngth, -for the use of .'isitors-
Pasengers from London on the one handj or Carlisle on -the,-other, can be carried atraight.into the Exhibition-an -advantago -which is, jcistlyexpectel to contribute verymaterially to tliefinancial success 6f the undertaking. 'The iotWicitGardens'idjoin ,on the north tide; they will be open -at all timei during the Exhibition, -
The scene in theinterioi of the building at present is extremely aniMated. (Groups of workmen are everywhere engaged in giving the last-toucheg to the decori,tions. A athe upper end, within the semicircular roof of the central aisle, painters are forninrg in ornamental letters upon a highlydecorated ground the line-
"To wak-e the soul by tender trokes of art,"
corresponding to-the admirably chosen words placed over the entrance-. . - ...
" A thing of behuty is a joy for evOt In
The important and difficult task of hanging the pictures has commenced; Mr. Peter Cunninglham is putting up the Vandykes, and.threatens to anticipate the scheme recently sanctioned by Parliament of forming a collectioi of the portraits of persons eminent in British history. In one of the side galleries Mr. Augustus Egg .may be o)served marking the posations of the Turners; Constables. Martins, Wards, and. all th ,o'therOdern paintings 'which have been intrusted to his.care. Mr. Scharf, in the other, has made sOme progress in the hanging of the ancient pictures upon a principle which -ill be afterwards explained. The superintendent of the general museums r. Waring hu stationedbmself in the centre of te grejst ha, U-.ere he classifies and arranges as soon as they arrive articles in,old, tilver, bronze, wood, ivory and other materiald SheBernal and Soulage collecions are in the liands of Mr.Webb; while,at ilsort distance from the Palace,. Mr. Pratt has established an arnoury, irhere, nlnder the superintendence of Mr..PlanchU the armour from the Meyrick and other collections will be cleaned and arranged. Mr. Deane, the general commisioner, appears 'to pose the po*er of ubiquity. He is always. in the right place it the right time, and nothing can go wrong without hiz being present to note and rectifyit upon the instant. Industry reigns kupreme, and yet- there is n6o bustle and.confusion, such s marked the few weeks which preceded the openingof the GrestExhibitionii-THyde Park. Much of the scffolding has been rem4ovod, everything is in its proper place, and there is nothing to interrupt the view' of go elegantproporti6ns and beautiful decorationa of the central halL - New objects.of interest or amussrnent meet the-eye at every turn. A portrait standing on its head, or a draped statue prone upon the ground, has a rather curious effect. The of Henry VmI. ,when stripped of its armour is a somewhat ludicrous object. It is not uninteresting to notice, among the contributions of' -,er Majesty, an old cas, from Windsor Castle with the name of the Prince Pegent upon it. But, above all, it is pleasant to observe the perfect order and regularity with which the whole business is conducted. As the time approaches for the opening of the Exhibition it is possible that there may be some disorder; bxt at present everything,goes like clockwork. A great number of cases, some of them very bulky, Arrive every day, but they cause no inconvenience. They are removed from the trucks to the tranzept of the building, where they are opened, and their' contents at once taken to the spot where they are to be exhibited. Frequent removals of worka of art are thus obviated, free, circulation throughout the building is never obstructed, and the officials are always able' to accomplish the work of the day.
Inland And Submarine Telegraphic Communication.
INLAND AND SUBMABAIVE TELEGBAPHIC
COOMMUrICATION.
TO THE EDIT OR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-,No one who as read the able article in 2%e Time of the 8th inst. under the above title can fail to wish ,uccess to a project which promises to bring telegraphic com. munication within the reach of the poorest in this country, and to enablo those who correspond with foreign lands to do so at a moderato- expense. Bat it is more especialy with regard to our great and increasing Indias empire that the formation of a cheap and rapid mode of communication is at this moment to be desired, both in the interests of the'publi and of the Government. It is a matter of some importance, therefore, that the aid oE those] improvements in electric telegraphs 'which the Article I have alluded to so lucidly explains should be employed in any scheme which may be adopted for a line of Indian telegraphs.
I learn from good authority that the company who are about to carry out 3r. Allan's patents is the " United Kingdom Telegraph Company," who obtained an Act of Parliament in 1851, and that they propose, as one branch of their ocean scheme, to carry a line from these shores to Gibraltar, thence to Malta, and so on to Seleucia, there to join "the European and East Indian Junction Telegraph Company," who are about to carry a line to the head of tha Persian Gulf and conect with the telegraphs bronSht ta that point by the East India Company.
The advantages of this line over any which may be is contemplatlon through Austria or Frnce are obvious.
It puts us in direct communication with Gibraltar, 3alta, and all the Mediterranean stations.
It secures perfect imnmunity for our Indian message from the posaible interference of foreiga and perhapshostile Governments. It forms a bais or main line for the best system of Mediterranean telographs which could be de. vised.
And, above al, beingrelievedfrom the charge enutailed upon messages by the tai of the continental lines andtheexisting English submarine lines, which ar very heavy, the cost of transmitting messages to India and the Mediterranesan via Gibraltar, would not be one-third of the amount which it will be found necesary to charge if the continental lines be adopted.
I have reason to know that the merits of this scheme have been pointed out to the Government, and offers made to them to complete it within 12 months. It is with dismay, therefore, that I read a letter in 17Ke Time.s of to-day from Mr. Lionel Gisborne, in which he states that it is Iu under. stood that the English Govermuent have made arrange. ments with an Austrian company for a complete system of telegraphic communication at the eastern end of the Mediterranean."
it is to be hoped that Mr. Gisborne is misinformed, and that the Government are not so blind to their own interests and to careless of those of the public as to adopt an imperfect and oxpensive scheme,whena cheap and e cient one hes ready to ter hand. But, inasmuch as Governments cannothavethe eyes of Argus, and Government officials may not be all immaculate, it is even possible that what Air. Gisborne asserts may be true.
I entreat you, therefore, Sir, to let T7w Timnes raise its voice in the interest of that pablic over whose welfare it has so long watchod with fidelity and care, and if we are at last to have an Indian telegraph use the influence you navo so faily earned and so justly exercised to obtain the bst and cheapest that can be planmed and carried out.
. enlose my card, and have the honour to remain, Sir,
Your obedient servant.

To theCONSERVATIVE ELEMTORSof the COUNTYof LA ARKL
Gentlemien,
IT is not without a feeling of great diappointment I. that I findmyselfdefeated in thp recent eonteat, whenIhad every resron to bope forsuccess. Bunthe feelingsw ith which I bid son farewell are free from all bltsenes% as I relect on the gallant and strenuoua exertions of mauy kind friends in my favour as the epreentative Of the Conservative Party.
The narrow majority by which our opponents carried the coDntyonly confirms me in myli>evi sis oonviition that if all the Conservatives and fniends of the Conetitstlon had been true to themselves, they woutf, witbout difficulty. have triumpbed in the battle thathas been fought. But so long as the members of any party are lineneedby minor conatderatioti-so long as gentlemen, profesting in generalimi-. lar dpolifeal opinions allow their volces andvotes to depend on triflng aba es of difference between the candidate and themselves, And eaCh elector reqnuies an entire concurrence with his Individnal views on every single point, so long moat every candidate meet with the defeat which Ihave experienced,
The presenu Is not the first instance in which our adversaries have taught us n useful lesion * for whatever may be their differences. or even their disseasions, whbe a great principle Is at stake, they merge tbem all, aad combine in a united party to car out their objects.
May I be permitted on parting from you to offer oneword of counsel, and humbly to express the opinion that yon *tM possess In this county the tower of returing a Conservative member. I m ure that it you will at once unite in an asoclation which shall combine all those who formerly were zealous in the cause suscess msat ultimately crown your etforta: and ar I can sa Is, that es a oounty gentleman who clings to the political opihions he has ever maintained, and without any mere se'dsh or personal views, it wi he my happinesu and privlege to oooperatewth you in so great and worthy an object, In whatever way my =lctanoe can be rendered asAillae.
In the circumstanoes iu which I am now placed by the adverse vote of yesterday, I have comfort in the conviction. that whlUe I have fought the battle to the -best of my abilities, I have not conspnted to purchae a single vote at the sacrflee of principle. At the close of this arduou. contest I remain professing in every partlcular the opinions with which I started, and I bave that whieh must eTvr be the beet consolation In the bour of defeat, that I have conducted my Canvss thsoughout with the mcst perfect courtesy towads my honourable opponent, and that I have neither myself, nor, so far As I snow, has anyone entitled to represent me, said a word or done one act which I have now cause to regret. You who have read the daily scrrilous attacks made upon me by the newspapers writing in the intcrept of my opponent. and who have seen thote articles misrepresenting my declaredopinfons and attackin'cmy cbaracter which have been industrousdycirenlated among the electors by BirEdward,Colebcro'ee'a Committee, will judge whetherIhavebeen met in the same spirit of courtesy and fairness by those conducting the contest on the otber frde,
Aud now, gentlemen, I mest touch on feelings near and dear to mry beart. Itis tome a most sorrowful concidence that the defest of our party occurred on the Tery day on which we lost that nobleman whose family have been so long associated witb the Consevatie Intereets of tbls great county. Our defeat is the defeat of a party. and may be retrieved, but the los of him we deplore is the lose of the whole cotmty and is Irreparable, The expresions of our regrets and the note R triumph of our opponents are alike hushed as we stand by the grave of him who was mnch and deservedly bonoured by alL
And now, gentlemen, it. conclnsion, I may asure you in all sincerity ibat with the present hour I seek to banish any unpleassnt feelings. whics may have sprung up in the course of the canvass while at the same time I shall ever fondly cherials the remesibrance of the many proofs of kindne a which have been shown to me during its progress by those upon whom I oould have no claims save that of our common Conservatisc
I have the honour to be, Gentlemen,
Your most obedient humble servant.

LONfDON, SATUPRDAY, APRIL 11, 1857.
An interval of settled tranquillity, at once explained and justified by the known prosperity and general content of most classes of that empire, has of late relieved European observers from any necessity for speculating on the state of France. Recently, indeed, the office of moralizing seems to have been appropriated by our neighbours, some of whom have been shaking their heads at our debates, our elections, and the triumph of Lord PAnmnRSTON, with here and there an expression of belief that we were rather in a bad way than otherwise. M. DE LAMAILTINE, we remember, arrived at this conclusion some years ago, and even gave such a practical effect to his opinions as to withdraw his property from England and seek an investment for it under institutions more stable than our own. We reed never, horiever, be at the trouble of going abroad for these agreeable omens. There are always plenty of our own countrymen prepared to assert that England's sun is setting for ever, and we suppose the satisfaction experienced in such croakings must be an incident of AngloSaxon nature, for Americans, we are told, are invariably to be found who, though perfectly impressed with the grandeur of their ultimate destiny, are nevertheless ready to maintain that the actual state of things around them is ruinous and menacing in the extreme. The real secret of all these prophecies is easily discernible. In countries where political power is necessarily a fluctuating element, and where the interest of one class or another may prevail in its turn, the party of the Outs finds its consolation in disparaging that of the Ins, and the downfall of the whole fabric is predicted as a natural sequel of the policy preferred. Luckily, we are inured to this kind of ruin, and can get through a good deal of it without much harm.
It is not, however, without reason that France has recently been exempted from the notice vwhich in former days the unstable character of its institutions and politics so naturally invited. Nrot only has the present Govermnent been secured from disturbance, but this immunity has been enjoyed through periods of financial pressure, high prices, and evcn European war. On the surface of affairs, indeed, there appears but a single feature calling for special attention, and this is one of so peculiar a character as not to be very readily appreciated in a country like our own. We are informed periodically either by notifications of arrests or on other occasions of a similar description that Secret Societies in France stllt exist, and within these few days it has been stated that some stir was discoverable in quarters where the agency at work was presumed to be theirs. It is, of course, rather difficult to pronounce
upon operations which are presumed, by their very nature and object, to be removed from public cognizance; but, as far as opinions can be ventured upon such a point, we are not disposed to attach much weight or importance to the machinations thus reported.
The mere existence of Secret Societies, or associations instituted for the preservation of secret doctrines, is not peculiar either to the France of the 19th century or to any one country at any particular period. A new and distinct vitality, however, appears to have been imparted to the Secret Societies of the Continent by the measures of repression which were adopted by the absolute Governments a'fter the expectations raised at the settlement of 1815. In Italythe Carboanriaoquired prominence; in other kingdoms various forms and names were assumed by the initiated; but it was in France that this singular machinery was most extensively established. In that country the Secret Societies, more especially after what was regarded as the coup nltanqz of 1830, embraced both doctrines and objects of a more decided character than had ever prevailed before. Among the former were those of Socialism or Communism as developments of Democracy, wlile the latter took the shape of sanguinary aggression against existing Powers. OriginaUy Secret Societies were essentially defensive in their nature; they represented invariably some oppressed or persecuted sect, and their object was less the overthrow of any established doctrine than the preservation of their owvn from utter extinction. But in France the initiated combined together to create or improve opportunities for the subversion of the Government under which they lived, and their assumed success, followed by their ultunate failure, in 1848, has left their representatives at the present day prepared to vindicate their power and doctrines by renewed conspiracy and outbreak. These are the Secret Societies of which information reaches ua at intervals. Englishmen, whose ideas of such associations are drawn from the harmless examples of Ancient DTruids, Odd Fellows, or Foresters, will be at some loss to understand how they can import any derangement to the constitution of a State, but such is undoubtedly their adopted mission, although, for the reasons subjoined, we do not think the element of disturbance can at present possess much real power.
It is obvious that such societies must have a positive object in the institution of some Government of their own choice in place of that subverted, and that this substitute, if their efforts are to be successful, must be approved by the nation at large. The aim of the initiated in France is notoriously the establishment of Democratic Socialism, but it is perfectly certain, beeause it has been openly proved, that such a political creed is distasteful to the population of the country. Without entering into the origin or causes of this repugnance, we need only remark that the insurrection of 1848 placed the Democratic Socialists actually in possession of power, and that theywere unable to maintain it from sheer want of popular support. France would not have a Republic of anykind, still less a repubEc of Socialists. The decision of the country in this case was even more strongly pronounced than in that of the Orleanist dynasty, for that was simply allowed, when assailed, to fall without aid, whereas the Republicans were directly superseded by appeal made to the nation. We cannot, therefore, conceive that France would now be disposed to acquire through peril and convulsion institutions which, when quietly offered, she declined to accept. Neither do we attach much weight to the numbers or strength sometimes ascribed to the affiliated associations. If their progress could be independently ascertained they would no longer be Secret Societies; if not, the reports must have proceeded from those who had an interest in magnifying the truth. Secrecy is in itself essentially the protection of the weak. There is another consideration, too, which might explain the accession of novices to societies like these without really importing any serious results. Mystery has always charms, and many a foolish young artisan might join an association at the suggestion of his comrade without the smallest design of carrying out its principles in the fashion contemplated by its leaders. We have no doub- that the societies in question exist, and that their chiefs, even after the purgation of 1852, are active and resolute. In fact, the complete proscription of their doctrines yields pmecisely those conditions under which such leagues would naturally he called into action; but we have good reason for presuming that a very large majority of the French population, comprising the vast bulk of the middle classes and the peasantry, are so far -satisfied with their present institutions as to entertain little desire of cbange even in the abstract, less stil through a renewal of convulsion and terrorism, and least of all for the sake of chimerical principles tte absurdity of which they bave already experienced and deliberately renounced.
There is nothing more interesting to watch than
There is nothing more interesting to watch than the changes which have come, or are coming, over the English race in the various regions where it has settled and taken root. Canadians, citizens of the United States, tropical planters, and settlers at the Antipodes have all assumed, or are in process of assuming, their several characters. Climate, institutions, occuDation, and mode of life, have their share in producing these differences; but the first is the most potent agent. Americans and Australians are Englishmen with a sunny sky. That they should fail to receive more warmth of temperament, more quickness of feeling, and perhaDs more delicacy of taste, from the bright light and pure air in which they live would be surprising indeed. But, wide as may be diversities, there are still some general characteristics which never alter. The Anglo-Saxon is always enterprising, self-reliant, domineering over men of any other stock, an indefatigable planter, builder, and trader. These are his great or good qualities. On the other hand, he carries with him one fault to every region of the globe. Intemperance in drink is practised as much under the scorching suns of the Southern States, or amid the hot winds of the Australian wilderness, as in our own moist and foggy atmosphere. Temperance Soc;eties, Teetotal Socicties, and Maine Liquor Laws, are unable to eradicate the evil, which lessens only inasmuch as society becomes every day more humane and civilized. it would be a strange thing to find in any part of the world men of our race deserting the ardent alcohol of their fathers for the milder drinks of the European continent. Yet we canmot but think that such a result will be brought about by the lapse of time. Our people may never become as abstemious and as undesirous of stimulatUig beverages as the Italian or the Oriental, but it is quite probable that, under the influence of a warm climate, their tastes may be contented with drinks less exciting than those to which they are now accustomed.
For instance, the Australians, our youngest ofshoot, are now seriously turning their attention to the culture of the -vine, not with the wish to imitate any particular Etiropean growth, but as a batfral aud permanent production of the country. In America the thing has been long talked of, and in certain districts practised; but the same obstacle to success has intervened as will probably impede the Austrahan experiment. Wine-
growing is the pursuit of a poor and laborious
peasantry, content with little, and able to give up I their whole time to the culture of a smaU area. The husbandman and his wife, in a good vineyard, are always watching the shoots, carrying earth up the hillside to replace that which has been washed away by the rain or parched into dust by the sun, clipping, pruning, and digging, and must often be content in the end with a narrow and precarious return. This will not do for a pushing people in an empty country, and wine is not generally grown in the States, simply because the average production is not remunerative at the average price of labour. However, the Australians appear, from the tone of some of their newspapers, to be sanguine of success. Samples of their wine were sent to the Paris Exhibition, were pronounced excellent, and honoured with a medal. Why, then, should not the production be attempted on a large scale Why should Australia be dependent for its beverages on London firms, who send out bottled ale and brandy more or less genuino at enormous prices? Australia produces good wine, which the Australians like so much that it is all bought up, and there is none to be had. In a few years, with enterprise and industry, the country may not only supply itself with wholesome drink, but make large profits by exporting the surplus to Europe. We are glad to learn that there are farms in New South Wales which actually produce from 15,000 to 20,000 galons a-year each, and that there is sufficient inducement for new farmers to invest capital in vine cultivation. It is not impossible, therefore, that the present generation may see our greatest dependency the seat of a great production of the most generoug of beverages, and perhaps rivaling France and the Rhineland in the quality and celebrity of its growths.
We can well anticipate that a supply of cheap and good wine may change the tastes of the Australians, who will find it more pleasant in their almost tropical climate to quaff some Antipodean rival of champagne or claret than to heat their blood with exotic ale, porter, and gin. Perhaps, in accordance with the custom of Anglo-Saxon colonists, they will transfer the names of celebrated personages or places to their new vineyards, and this newest of worlds will have its Clicquot and its Johaunis'erg. We wish them ful and speedy success, not merely for their own sakes but for our own. There can be no doubt that the production of wine, or at least of good wine, in Europe has positively diminished of late years. The grape disease, in conjunction with the unsettled state of the Continent and the deficiency in crops vitaly necessary to subsistence, has limited the supply, and there is no immediate prospect of abundance. Even if the cultivation extended, it would probably be unable to keep pace with the increased demand. France and Germany produced nearly as much wine fifty years ago as they do now, and within that time whole races have come into the circle of wine consumption. In those days Russia and the United States could hardly be said to exkt as wine-drinking countries; now they are disposedto carry their taste for this luxury beyond even the old established countries. Of late years the increase of wealth, the spread of civilization, and perhaps of vanity and the desire of display, have immensely increased the demand for the more delicate wines of all kinds, and particularly those of France. We are, in fact, threaLened with a dearthof good wine at any reasonable price. Why, then, should we not hail the prospect of a supply from. the Antipodes ? There is no reason why the hillsides of Victoria and New South Wales should not produce a grape of as exquisite a flavour as any that ripeus from the Rhine to the Atlantic. Geelong and Paramatta may one day be household words among us. Under the influence of high prices and more temperate habits, the importation of foreign wines has greatly decreased within tie present generation, and the reduction of duty would confer but little benefit; but with an in~ creased production of less fiery wines than ere at present consumed the question of a more free admission would become worthy of the attention of politicians.
The defence offered by Mr. STAPLETON to the
The defence offered by Mr. STAPLETON to the charges brougbt against him as Director, and subsequently as Deputy-Governor of the Rloyal Britsh Bank, just amounts to this,-that he was not an active and conscious participator in that series of abominable frauds and iniquities which has brought ruin and desolation upon so many families. Even if this were true-we say, even if this were true-in what position does he stand before his countrymen ? Here is the case of a man of mature yeers, a member of the bar, a member of Parl:ament, who by his own free cho;ce-for the sake of adding to his income-takes upon hinself the responsibilities of the direction of a large commercial concern, who allows fifty iniquities to pass unchallenged under his immediate eye, and who, when the crash has come and the ruin has fallen, comes forward to claim a foors pardon. That is just the plea which MIr. STAPLETON endeavours to make out for bimself. He was cajoled, deceived; he had much reason for complaint; his colleagues kcpt hin in the dark; he couldn't get at the account-books; he couldn't judge of the value of the securities. This went on for a time, and then we have anotler phase of the defence. When he became aware of the iniquities which were in course of perpetration under his sa-nction and the sanction of, his colleagues, was it for Mr. STAPLETON to give the alarm? No I The point of honour was to persevere and be true to bis companions. He remonstrated, he made propositions which were rejec'ced, but he continued to hold his seat in the Direction, and to act even as Deputy-Governor. Enough was extracted from MIr. STAPLETON, although his examination was conducted in a very merciful and tender spirit, to show that for a long time after he knew the Bs.nk was hopelessly insolvent he stood by and held his peace, if he did nothing more. Of course, when somewhat pressed-and he was never very hardly pressed-upon any inconvenient point, he had ready the stereotyped answer, " Vith regard to that my mind is a " perfect blank." It is not the ftrt time in the forensic history of England that " Yon " m i 9-ordo" has been the motto of a witness vho feared the consequences to himself of a more direct reply. In all such ca-es, however, the val-ae of the excuse is to be teLted by the contrast between the extreme precision with which the witness remembers even the most minute facts which can tell in his favour and his utter oblivion of whatsoever may prejudice his own interests. NvVith regard to the latter class of incidents Lethe has passed over his brain, or his back wasjust turned when somethingpeculiarly strong was in course of concoction. He remembers well that his back was turned, or that he had just stepped into the next room for a mouthful of lunchieon-he has not forgotten about the luncheon,-and so on throughout the usual catalogue of shifts and prevarications. The case of Mr. STAPLETON is a very bad one in this respect-that he was well aware that his name and position were ulsed as a lure to attract other victims into the trap, and he made no effort to undeceive either them or the shareholders, not even by the feeble measuro of withdrawal. Bit by bit, even according to his own confession, the whole series of rascalities which haa beeh concocted and catried out by his predeceesors and colleagues was pufolded before him, but he atiUl persevered-he still continued to lend whati eve o£ assistance or repute Light be derived from
the use of his name to this miserable tWrupt concenm when. he must have well kchown that every succesive day on which its offices were opened for the tansaction of business was a fresh outrage upon the first principles of morality and common honesty.
The first incident connected with the ranagemeat of the Bank in which we find him in company with his colleagues was the visit to Sir JT.4 s MATHESON. It wil not have been forgotten that CA&xxoN had gone there too for the expres plurpose of securing Sir JAes's accession to the concern. The letter from ESDAILE to AMPOy, which is now famous in the annals of the Royal British Bank, was produced again on Wednesday as proof of the fact. Now, it is not a little remarkable that Mr. STAPnLEToi, the newly-made Director, is found at the same time staying on a visit with Sir JAMxs; but "he knew nothing "about the letter at the time. He recollected "Mr. E$DAILB coming to him, and telling him "that Mr. CGuinoN hoped he would induce Sir "J&ajrn MAT.SnOXN to join the Bank, and to be"come its chairman, and he quite laughed at the "idea, as he knew that Sir JA&sinS only came to town "to attendParliament." We will, however, grant that Mr. STAPLETON may have only been made a cat's-paw of on this occasion, and that he had not at that time been initiated into the impure secrets of the Royal British Bank, and the more recondite mysteries of the green ledger. T#t appear's, however, that somewhere about the middle of October uneasiness was felt even among the Directors as to their financial condition. The' met and talked matters over; but Mr. STAPLETON had just stepped out to luncheon, or something of that sort. The book showing the state of their account at the Bank of England was on the table, but he never lboked at it. In November the state of Mr. Huarruny BRowN's account was brought under Mr. STAPLETON'S notice. " That rather "startled and alarmed him " but he did nothing. Mr. BRowN had promised that he would see to the matter when 'he came to town, and upon this satisfactory assurance -Mr. STAPLENO rested content. Did 'he take any pains to inquire into the real position of the ships which had been mortgaged to the Bank e Oh, dear, no I "How could he inquire ?" " By " searching the register." "cHe never did that." This gentleman, a barrister of some 17 years' standing, a man of mature years, who had voluntarily, and for the sake of gain, taken upon himself the responsible office of Director of a Bank, did not even know how to assure himself of the value of property which had been mortgaged to the concern! MIr. STAPLETON'S next noticeable act was to sign the certificate to the Board of Trade which represented-we know now with how much truth-that :the 30,000 shares had been completed and the "501. paid up." Then advances had been made to the extent of 190,0001. to Mr. lRlows, to MIr. DE TAPE, and MIr. RiGBy, and upon the WVelsh mines. This beingthestate of affairsupon the 31st of December, Mr. STAPLETON was quite surprised to hear from Mr. ITNRLATER'S mouth, for the first time, that the total provision made on the day named for bad debts was just 3391. 17s. The 5th of February was a memorable day vwith Mr. STAPLETON; he then, despite of all he knew and al he suspected, accepted the office of Deputy-Governor. Then the green ledger was no longer a sealed book to him, and he ascertained the state of CAM-sOoN's account, but stiU he held on. Then he becalme aware of the state of Mr. OLIVZ'S account-still he held on; then of Mr. M'GREGoR's account-still he held on. Mr. STAPLETON, it seems, was not without certain feelings of self-complacency as to his knowledge of banking affairs all this time, for he thus remarks upon the conduct of a very wise person named Bri CrER, who refused to take vip shares which had been allotted to him:-" Mr. " BLACI;ER was a very nervous man, and I did " not consider him a good judge of banking "affairs." Then there was the attempt to drag Deputy DAKLN into the filth; proceedings were contemplated against him; and all this time M1r. STAPLETON was actively engaged at the Board. Then it was determined to pay a dividend un on the supposed profits of this miserable banLkrupt imposture, and again MIr. STAPLETOSN was a party to the resolution. We have not space to run even in a cursory manner through all the particulars of this disgraceful story, as brought out in the course of Mr. STAPLETON'S examination on Wednesday last, but we canuot dismiss it wvithout a slight allusion to the closing act of all, for which the Deputy-Governor must take his fair share of responsibility.
This act was a negotiation -with the London and Paris Bank. The Royal British Bank, ruined and insolvent as its Directors and its Deputy-Governor well knewr it to be, was to make a loan to the London and Paris Bank. Mr. LrNKLATER put this question to MIr. STAPLETON,-" NWas not that loan " by the Royal British Bank to be placed to the " credit of the account of the London and Paris
Bank, in order that tley mi-ght go for t1heir " charter, and say that the cap;tal ha4l been paid "up ?-Mr. STAPLETON ultimately admitted "that it was." This most vile and scandalous imposture was the fitting close to the proceedings of the Royal British Bank. It is, if we remember the story aright, a misstatement onMr. STAPLETON'S part when he says, " The run on our Bank came, and " the two Banks went down together." Our recollection of the matter is, that the London and Paris Bank never got beyond the stage of inception, and never transacted business at all, the shareholders retiring in time from such rotten grotund. Be this, however, as it may, can any cardid and unprejudiced person read this simple statement, as taken from his own lips, of the proceedings to which Mr. STAPLETON was a party, and hold him to be in a position one whit better either than Mlr. ESDAILa or MIr. PELLATT ? For the first part of the res geear which occurred r.fter be joined the Direction lie asks for a fool's pamdon; but we maintain that even this cannot be conceded to him. Any professional man-let us say any surgeon-is bound to bring to his business a certain reasonable amount of skill, failing which he will be made answerable for any calamities which
may ensue. Is the Director of a Bank to be the sole exception to tlhis salutary rule 1 There came, however, a period in which M r. STAPLETON admits
that he 'was well acquainted with the true state of affairs, but still lio persevered. Ruin to others and dishonour to themselves were the consequences of what he and his colleagues were about, but they held on their path and made no sign. Mr. STAPLEToN now represents Berwick in the House of Commnne.

"Poisoning By Photography."
"POISONING BY PHOTOGRAPHY."
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-My attention having been attracted by a letter in The Times of to-day with the above terrible beading, in relation to the use of cyanide of potassium as a photographic agent, perhaps you will allow me, through the medium of a spare corner of your paper, to endeavour to correct an error that seems very prevalent of late regarding the use and nature of this chymical substance.
I may nieDtion that there are technical reasons for the use of cyanide of potassium in photography which do not .allow of hyposulphite of soda being substituted as a fixing agenit, as sugges9ted by your correspondent "A. V. G.'
The caso of Dr. Atlerstone, which appears to have raised the fears of your correspondent, aud to which he attaches so much importance, I believe to have been much exaggerated in its detail<, to say the least of it; for, during my own prac. tice of photography (some 10 years), I have frequently undergonec the inconvenience of getting some cyanide into a cut, bhit there the affair has terminated.
"A. V. (." wouldleadyourreaders to infertbattheinstant the cyan,iJo of potassium touches the bare flesh the poison circulates :n the veins, alarming symptom8 present themselves directly, and we are led to the inevitable conclusion that death eijl and must close the scene.
Such, ho wever, I can assure photographers, from actual experience, is nvot the case; and in muitigation of "A. V. G.'s" agony at the siuppobition of his meeting with the accident In a late experiment of his, I can only say that if the fatal drop had comie in contact with his unprotected flesh it would simply have made it smart very much. Nothing of la more seri,.us nature would have followed. He may mako hinuiEelf quite easy on that point.
The fact of cyanide of potassium as used in Shotograpby causing such results as indicated by "A. V. .' is simply ridiculous, for, on examination of the formula recommendt4 for its use, we find that a drop of solution contains 1-240th -of a grain of cyanide of potassium, and the active poisonous element in this quantity is 1-720th of a grain.
Now, this quantity, I submit, is not sufficient to cause -any derangement of the aystem; in fact, there is no more danger in using cyanide of potassiun in photography than there is in drinking alcohol disguised as sherry at -dinner.

Rain fell in tor. rents, inundeting many of the roads to a considerable depth, aid inflictlig serious injury upon the young crops. A district of country about three miles from the town was visited by a remarkably heavy fail of hail, the stones being of an almos u precedented size and covering theground forhours. We have not heard of any mischief heing done in Stsmford by -the lightning. but at South Luffenhain, a village about seven niles distant, it struck the thatched roof of a large b36rn on the premises of Mr. Tailby. This ocourred shortly before 6 o'clock, while the owner was on his way home from Sta n- ford market. The barn had been completely filled only the day previous with grain (wheat and barley), both tbrashed and in the straw, and the whole of this speedily became one mass of fire. The neighbours rendered prompt and energetic aid, being well supplied with water from the late heavy rain, but they were unable to prevent the flames communicating with the house, one portion of which was thatched and adjoined the barn. The valuable contents of -the barn were completely destroyed, and considerablo -damage was done to the house, though, fortunately, a por-tion of it, bhich had a slated roof, vas saved. Upwards of two hours elapsed before the arrivnl of engines (one from *Uppinghamn, six miles distant, and anotber from Stanford); consequently tbey were of very little use.

The Transit iron steam troophhiP, Commander Ennis Chambers, was got into dock with mu.'h difficulty on Thursday afternoon, but the water did not clear out in time to enable any accurate report to be made on the disaster that evening. On inspecting the ship when the dock was empty a hole about the size of a dinner plate, though more jagged than circular, showed itself, through which the water streamed in a fierce current; the hole is at the distance of the second sheet of iron from the keel on the starboard side just before the foremast. This hole has been made, it is now discovered, by the Transit's own anchor running into her, but which part is not known-it is believed to be the fluke; the stock was carried away, it is supposed by the weight of the ship resting upon it, as her bottom is rubbed bright about the length of the stock. This seems feasible, as the anchor wasalmo3t "up and down," owing to theshallownessof the water she brought up in. When she auchored off Yarmouth (Isle of Wight) she had only five fathoms of water under her, hers elf drawing at the time nearly 25 feet I The disaster must have happened on the morning of Wednesday, about 5 o'clock, whereas the vessel anchored about 6 o'clock on the previous night. The engineer was the first to dis. cover the accident by going down into the engine-room, when he found himself up to his waist in water; the alarm was then given and three pumps set to work; the troops were all got aft so as to lighten the pressure forward, and, finding that the leakage did not decrease, the vessel was put about for Spithead and Portsmouth harbour, which she happily reached in safety and without assistanceThe troops and baggage were immediately transferred to the Bellerovhon, and hands from the ExceUent and Marine Artillery barracks set to work forthwith to pamp to keep her afloat and to got out the ammunition and stores. AU her powder is damaged, sugar and peas spoilt, flour and oatmeal damaged, and all other matters under water. The men employed were up to their necks in water in getting the ammunition out of the fore magazine. The bread being stowed aft has not suffered like the other provisions, which were stowed forward. The Transit owes her safety to having seven different water-tight compartments, so that the water did not get aft. Blacksmiths and shipwrights were put upon her immediately the water was out of the dock, and worked upon her all the night of Thursday. and by 11 o'clock yesterday morning the external damage was repaired and water let into the dock to ascertain if she was watertight, and, this proving all right, she was got out of dock and into the steam basin.
A court of inquiry on the co mmander, master, and officer of the wtch was helct yesterday by Admiral-Sxperintendent Martin at his offi ce, but which, being a closed court, we cannot report. It is expected, however, to be merely preliminary to an open cour t-martial, when aU the facts vwiU be laid before the pu blic. It is a singular but discreditable fact that the wholo family to which the Transit belonsthe UTrgent, Perseverance, Assistance, &c.-never put to sea since they were admitted into the fleet without some dis. aster. The peculiar manner in which the Perseverance made her d'?b.de in the service-by " turning turtle" iu Woolwich basin-our naval readers doubtless remember.

Relative Rank.
BBLATIVE BANK.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TDIES.
Sir,-Allow me to corroborate the statements of your correspondent " R. S." as to the annoyances medical officers in the army havo to bear from the ambiguity of tho term I ' relative rank." At the present time, especially in Crimean regiments, nearly every medical officer has many men superior to him in rank who are much younger than himself, and the majority of whom are infinitely inferior to him in abilities and education. Now, these gentlemen, being young officers, do not know the importance of the surgeon's position regarding the welfare of the army, and are consequently inclined to interpret the term "relative rankr very favourably for themselves, looking down upon the medical officer, whom they speak contemptuously of, as -'only a doctor" or " a pill," as the case may be.
Older officers generally listen with deference to tho statements of medical officers, from their knowledge of the importance of asurgeon's position, bht they even occasionaUy letthe medical man know that he is no officer at al in reality, but only tolerated because he is necessary for the good of the prmy. Now, it is not a pleasant thing to feel that yon are tolerated, especially when you know you have aU the advantages acquirements can give on your side. This feeling is so strong that every medical officer in the service is reserving himself for a grand effort to obtain a reform of the Army Medical Department-a reform that must eventually be effected, so great aro the grievances felt.
In the Crimea 100 medical officers signed a petition to Lord Panmure for reorganization of the department; it, however, somehow fell into the hands of Dr. Andrew Smith, and he returned it with the " snub " that the gentlemen signing it did not know what they were signing about. Itwas re-sent, and a second " snub" was received-this time from Lord Panmare, who has a habit of buttoning up his pockets whenever you suggest anything in which the expenditure of money is concerned. Mr. Stafford, who saw what medical officers could perform in spite of maladministration at Scutari, then obtained a committee of the House of Com. mons to inquire into the grievances medical officers complained of; and their report substantiates these grievances and advocates their removal. Their suggestions Lord Palmerston cannot undertake to carry out at present, because he is taking off the excess of income-tax; bet this must be reaUy a very poor exonse when we consider the paltry *um the alteration would make to the country. A petition has since that time been signed by.250 medical officers in the kingdom-in fact, only seven gentlemen, who were afraid of losing promotion, objected to signing it-and for. warded to the different universities and colleges for the members to use their influence to obtain the same " relative rank" for army medical men that medical practitionere receive in civil life, and this has been most warmly responded to by the members of the colleges to whom it was sent. When a feeling so universal and strong as this is proved to be once takes footing in the minds of educated men, the time must come when it works the reform it advocates, although it may take years to do so.
To a certain extent it is a war of mind against money, a tussle that generaUy ends in favour of the latter, unless some power gives the former the precedence; in this case it may be managed by substantiating the "relative rank" of medical officers.
With many thanks for the kind manner in which you have always advocated the cause of army medical officers,
I remain. vonrs trnly.

Sir.-Your report in Thle Times of to.day of the speech of Mr. Whatman, MLP. for West Kent, at the declaration of the poll yesterday, is liable to a misconception which I claim permission to prevent. Mr. Whatman referred to a proposal which I had made, in whioh certain Roman Cathohics had concurred, to which he had himself in general terms consented, and which appears to have been approved ny the freeholders present.
That proposal was the making uver the buildings to the Roman Catholics, and the payment of a sum of money, not '*in satisfaction of all claims for tho anaaalpayent," which might seem to mean such a sumu as noald produce interest equal to the present annual psymc t but in satis. faction of all vested interests, This proposal, carriedinto tflect in a liberal spirit, means giving th n Catholics such a sum as would have carried on the.

The Rent Crisis In Paris.
THE RB.NT CRTI,S IN PARIS.
Under this head the RevuC temp.wainc has publisbed Ats interesting article by the Comte de Tourdonnet. The author, starting from the facts stated in the report of the Prefect of the Seine of December 2, 1856, from which it appears that the number of houses built since 1851 far exceeds the nuisber of houses pulled down, comes to the conclusion that the great demolh ions that hxve been in progresw in thisi capital for some years past are but a secondary cause of the present exorbitant rate of rents, and that the prime and permasent cause thereof is the revolution that is gradually eing accomplished in the tastes and mannera of the ParisiaBs. The 8implicity of former days, he contends, has given way to expensive habits and to a taste for luxury, w ch, in d oe proportion! has pervaded all classes of citizens - a fact which Is not ony applicable to the inhabitants of Paris, but to the whole of Europe, and may be considered a peculiar feature of the period in whicb we live-a period, he thinks, of moral decline. Hence it is that speculators, instead of building houses for the middling and lower classes, have exclsively built for the rich, leaving a vast amount of population to find shelter as well as they may. That the present inconvenience as regards the higher rents is but tem,porary he admits, but maintains, on the otber haud, that those more suited to the limited means of the majority will experience no diminution for a long time ct, coizie, and at all events will never return to the moderate rate of former years, because, as before stated, the rise is not accidental, but owing to a permanent cause-a graoual social revolution. The demolitions were a necessity resulting from three distinct causes-the desire of embellishing Paris and ridding its monuments of the unseemly buildings and narrow streets which concealed them from viewv; the requirements of public health, which imperatively demnanded the removal of those hotbeds of disease with which the centre of Paris abounded; and the equaUy important consideration that, in a strategical point of view, the narrowness of the streets in certain quarters might afford a comparatively small number of revolutionists the m,eanis of successfully resisting the ublic force and spreading alarm, not only over Paris, but ove all Europe. The State and the city joined, therefore, in carrying the improvements into effect as speedily as possible, the demolitiom s were executed, and the ground sold to private speculators, whomn no law could bind to any particular kind of construction. and who therefore laid out their cKpital in splendid buildings far sbove the means of the humbler classes. Here 51. de Tourdonnet sounds a note of alarm, and warnis proprietors to hear the voice of reason in time and lower their present exorbitant demands, since, however strong a Government may be, it might yet be taken by surprise in the case of a sudden and iiniversal outburst, and might be unable, at least for a time, to avert the venaeance of an infuriated multitude, of which the landlords would be the first victims. At the same time the author of the article deprecates any legislativo interference with the ruling price of rents, and condemns other violent remedies lately proposed; one in particular, advocated by the anoDymoUs wnter ol a pamphlet entitled PIus de Propric&aires, according to which the btate ought to buy up aU the houses in Paris and lease them out on moderate terms. M. de Tourdonnet unrelcntingly exposes the absurdity of such a plan. le next enters into the domestic habits of life of the working classes, and shows that the maxim which allots one-fifth or one-sixth of a man's revenue to the payment of his rent is by no means applicable to them, and that their rent must beara mnch lower proportion to their arnnual income. This is not only the cash with the workman who earns his bread by mere manual lhboi'r, but also with many a functicnary stricken in years. many a clerk, many a one, in short. who derives his livelihood from mentallabour. The latter ciasses. noreover, have to contend with another difficulty, that of being obliged from their position to dress in asomewhatmore expensive style. It is by thesethe rent-crisis is most severely felt. This state of things has forced a large number of the populatin to emigrate from the centreto the eircumference of 1'aris. From tine i mmea orial certain trades have beea located almost exclusively in certain quarters of Paris, and the workmen belonging to these trades naturally clustered around the centre of their peculiar handicraft. The demolitions have broken up all these partial agglomerations, and it now becemes important to examine whether it be expedient to renlove the working classes from the centre to the circumference, and whether they should dwell in the neighbourhood of the manufactures to which they belong. Both these questions the author answers in the affirmative He even examines a third question, which an Englishman may find irrelevant, but which is quite in accordance with the democratic tendencies of French society, viz., whether this removal of the workmen will impede the fusiob of the various classes of society; and he is of opinion that it will not, since many derks and lower functionaries will be induced to follow the working classes to the outskirts. In order to render this emig-ration as little onerous as possible to the classes in question, the author proposes-First, cheap omnibuses, esDecially destined to convey the workmen to their centres of activity; and secondly, the removal of certain trades, especially those which are carried on by machinery nnd steam, from the centre of Paris to its circumference. He examines the expediency of erecting ctJs ourriares, and condemns them as being contrary to the tastes of the workmen, to their sense of individual freedom, and also, from the agglomeration of individuals of both sexes, to the interests of morality. But what he recommends is the erection of buildings containing small apartments. An apartment of from 33 to 35 square metres he considers sulfficient for a family of five persons. Such a subdivisionof space may often becontrarytotheintereste of a proprietor; still many lodgingsof thatsize maybe constructed even in tbecentreof Paris; but alarge numbershould exclnu sively be built in the outskirts within the octroi walls. Here tle author enters into many technicalities concerning the building and distribution of such houses, but especially recommends builders to avoid uniformity in the construction, both in the interest of art and that of the landlords, so that every man may find convenience according to his taste. Now, by what means can speculators be induced to invest their capital in a class of buildings which do not offer the pecuniaryadvantages so surely attainable in the case of elegant houses at high rents It is notorious that the poorer classes do not pay so regularly as those in easj circumnstances, and that they do not keep their dwellings in such good condition. As a set-off to these brawbacks, the State may offer gratuitous subsidies, concessions of ground, the opening of wide streets, exemption from taxation, &c. According to the plans approved by the Conseil des lIatimcnts Oivius, a house of four stories built on a surface of 150 square metres, will contain four small lodgirgs on each floor, thus accommodating from 75 to 100 persona. A house of this size, built in the outskirts of Panis, would coat 60,000f., ground and al1, In the course of tweo years about G00 such houses might be built, offering shelter to rearly B0.000 inhabitants, at a coat of 36,003,000f. This, the author thinks, would suffice to put an end to the present crisis.
The Representation Of Huddersfield.
THE REPRESBNTATION OF HUDDERSPIELD.
TO THE EDITOR OF THCE TTEES.
Sir,-The publication of a letter in your columns from Mr. W. Willans, the Chairman of Mr. Cobden's election committee at Huddersfield, " with respect to Mr. Cobden's defeat," calls for a brief remark or two from myself in behalf of Mr. Akroyd and his supporters.
As regards the part taken ia the Hudderafield election by Sir J. W. Ramsden, I am able to say that, notwithstanding the hon. baronet's strong personal desire for the success of Mr. Akroyd, his agents took no part in bringing about the defeat of Mr. Cobden or the success of Mr. Cobden's opponent.
Without presuming to speak of Sir J. W. Ramsden in the patronizing tone assumed by Me. Willans, I may say that the proceedings of the hon. baronet in Parliament have been watched here with great interest and satisfaction; but whether the representation of the West Riding, or that rf another, but still Yorkshire constituency is to be the "4 prize " for a continuance in the path already entered on is not for me to remark upon. The matter so put is too indelicate for public controversy.
Mr. Willans ascribes Mr. Cobden's defeat to the fact that "he was late in the field," and that " his health broke down in the middle of the contest." It would be unjust to Mr. Cobden himself to let these assigned reasons pass 'without refutation. In the faet of declared candidateship Mr. Akroyd had barely 20 worldng hours' start, and to suppose that it was necessary for Mr. Cobden, in such a borough as Huddersfield-an important part of the West Riding, which Mr. Cobden has represented for the last seven years, to make himself known against a comparative stranger, is an idea too preposterous to require serioas notice. As regards Mr. Cobden's health, though I would not for a mo. ment be supposed to cast a doubt upon the fact that his wonted health gave way, yet I may be allowed to, say that when the Manchester speech of Mr. G. Wilson appeared, which contained the first public announcement of Mr. Cobden's illness and its nature, Mr. Willans himself, before the day of nomination, issued a public caution on. the subject, bidding the electors to "baware of false reports," averring that Mr. Cobden had recovered, and that he would appear on the hustings.
The fact is, that the great body of the Hnddersfield constituency disagreed with Mr. Cobden both on the issue which he himself raised before them-the Chinese question-and on his conduct with reference to our national policy inT regard to Russia and Turkey in the late waa. Tim electora of Huddersfield could not forget that Mr. Cebden hal pleaded for the destruction of Turkish. In&pendence, and for the pos6ession of Constautinople by the Czar and his northern hordes. Neither could they forget that )a% was about the only Englishman that expresse4his joy at the destruction of Poland as an independent Stat.. The Euddersfield election, therefore, was determined on the samegrounds and from the same caxsesthat led to the West Riding meeting to which Mr. Cobden himselh appead oDN the breaking out of the late wa a, to reqect his policy and to uphold the Government in its vesistanee of Russiau aggression on th territory of the "sick man.' Thes
considerations induced moDe than one-half of the registered eleetora of Ruddersfield to record their votes. against Mr. Cobadn, acd that, too, without the exercise of any ir nauenca oeher than the promptings of true English feeling -and the determination to snpport those who Lhad in timne pft, and who in times present, were disppsed t uo our conuiry's bonour. It is to there causes and' nobaofiling health or the 2) hours' start which Mt l A'royd ha' over hi3, that MIr. Cobden owes his defeat6,
1Whe,ber 1c ~was wi; in Mr. C7obden's frieuds to subject hikm ~to tat d' sfeat, hai5g, as they had, enenr moral sraiulqtd 'bfie- ,nd that it, was inevitabla if the poll was apptu1e& :twoXa~tforrs~.ta decide.

Cumberland And Westmorland Wrestling.
CUMBERLAND AND WESTMORLAND
WRR9TT.Tva
The great annual wrestling meeting of the natives of the connties of Cumberland and Westmorland resident in Loff
don took place yesterday, and attracted an assemblage of 3,000 or 4, 000 persons. The weather was exceedingly fine, 'which, with the anticipation of good sport, consequent upon there being some very good men in London, may account for the largeness of the assemblage, which considerably exceeded that of former years. For some seasons past these sports have been celebrated at Hornsey-wood-house, but the committee, from a variety of causes, changed the scene of action this year to Mr. Baum's, the White Lion, Victoria Park station, Hackney Wick, where a large party of polce, under the direction of Superintendent J. Beokerson, were in attendance to preserve order. Those acquainted with this style of wrestling are doubtless aware that it is divested of all brutalty, the mnen vwrestling in their stockings; and the results are consequently dependent upon the amount of science displayed by the several competitors.
The prizes were divided into two classes-a silver wateb, and three snuffboxes, for the four first in succession under llst. ; and a corresponding number of prizes for those between 11 and 16 stone. Besides these, as an introduition to the sport, was a foot race, with nine comnristors,
fortastriein prizet wih the following wereuegaged-
Thomas Mien, Samuel Frani;land, Reginald hrudd George Brown, John Andrewsr, John Fothergill, James Duckworth, iles Johnson, and John go itnh.worthn The race was won, after three heats, by Samuel Frank

To The Editor Of The Times.
TO THEB BDITOR OP THB TIMES.
Sir,-Great consternation has arisen among brick-makers,
brickburners, excavators, and others concerned by a very| recent proceeding on the part of the parochial authorities of Islington, and the infliction of a fine of 51. by a magistrate at ClerkenweU upon a builder for burning a small quantity of clay in one of the roads now forming at Holloway, almost uninhabited, and nc-withstanding the immediate residents offered to prove that they suffered no inconvenience.
One of the inconsistencies is, that up to the last momeat the parochial authorities have sanctioned and enconraged the trade by additional assessments on -he first appearance of any sucn operation.
Are ballast clay burning and brickmaking in open fields and moderate-sized clamps such nuisances as to countervail all the advantages of cheap ballast and bricls for roads, sewers, and houses? The authorities have weU ':no wn that brickwalters have been contracting for the removal of their breese and ashes; that they have been digging and accamulating, turning and soiling clay, investing a1 their capital, and making every other preparation for blnming on the advent of spring. The labourers, also, have contractad for tbe season. Are thvy all to- be turned out of empl6ymeat, and their wives. and families thrownn upon the parish ? Have our laislators intended-will not our Ministers prevent-the sudden 2min of all who have th-m invested their capital and entezed intD contracts to make large quantities of bricks and pay heavy royalty reats, whetier made or not?
Is a new difficulty. to be created against that great exigeney-the iner2aso- of house accommodation? What is to become of the- clay hitherto burnt? Wlat of all the ashes, breese, and soil collected and manufactored duriug the winter, under contracts with the boards them-
Snrely this comnpllcatio-a of rnin ana difficulties is not to be decided off-handin the police-court. It thera te an evil that requires c"rrectionlet it be judiciously remedied. For one season at, least, b3ckmaking in smalf clamps might be allowed.
An appeal should be made by bh csrnakesa and builders to the SecroWary of StAte, and, if nscessary, to the metroolitan members for a deoutation.

The Washington Epidemic.
THE WASHIBGTOA ZPIDEfIC.
(Prtom the Z'ew York Thinas.)
The epidemio whioh reoently visited Washington city, and by which so many of the guets at the National Hotel were affected. ha1 attracted such wide attention that I have thought a more particular notice of it than any hitherto gubhlied would prone interesting and acceptable. The ge.eral facts are already known. The disease is diarrhma of an unusually obstiate type, accompnied freqietl~; by serere colic, alays by marked and sudden prostratlt.'n. and generally byr nausea nd other symuptoms indicX'tmg exceeding weakness and sensitiyeDess of tbe stomach. In most casea the torgue of the patient is found by the p ysioian to denote more or less inflmnmation of themucous me rane of the stemach. Different sgb. jects present many moditications ot thnag, oup of symptoms, but the foregomng we:e found to exist, igz reater or less deo gree, in nearly alL. V rions theories have been disonssed with a -ciewv to asocerting the cause of the sicknets, all of shich I propose to glance ai ill the course f this comn;ini cathon.
The disease first made its appearance early hi Janury, during a season of very vatiablo weather, subject to extrawr dinary changes of temperature, and, I may add, atfa sesai when gaiety and dissipation in Washington were at.the fn2B tide. t did not spread far, however, untl about ej middle of the month, immediately after the great thaw w3ichisncceeded the severe snowstorm of that season. At SkiS time the hotel was full, containing, I should suppose, some400'or E50 guests. The building, as is well known, ia old fashioted1 awkward, and not well arranged for comfort, conveniece, or perfect ventilation, But the enterprisiDg le&iees, Messrs. Guy and Briggs, by dint of extensive reperis and re-furnishing, and watchful attention to the conduct of the house in its various departments, managed' to overcome th,as serious drawbacks to public favour, and to secure a contented as well as numerouse household. The tables were served with care and neatness, the viands well cooked, and the dining-rooms compared favourably in all respects with the besthotela in that section. Frequently the guests-of whom I was one-complained of the foul air in the passages during a foggy day when the weather was
damp and the atmosphere heavy, or when we had a day orI two of unsually warmn weather for the seasn. Still scarcely anybody thought of fearing an epidemic as the result of any apparent cause.
Somewhere about the 15th or 20th of January the regular boarders began to be taken down in large numbers daily, and by the first week of February there were very few of them who were not suffering severely. Among the number were President Buchanan, Senator Hale and family, Senator Jaines and family, Senator Brown and family, Senator Bayard's family, Hon. J. Glancy Jones and family, Senator Fessenden, Horace H. Day, of New York, and friends; Marshall 0. Roberts, Cyrus W. Field, and probably 200 or 00 otbers. M own family were among the sufferers, and two of my chl den are even now but lust recovering, afteran illness of two months. One chalsactentstic of thecomplaintisthat the patient,afterbeing quite recovered and even when removed from the locality in which he was first afflicted, is suddenly prostrated by a return of the ailing with all its original malignity. " I can't get well and stay well" is the aLmost universal exclamation of the sufferers, who have proved, perhaps, by half a dozen relapses, the "vanity of human hopes." As may readily be supposed, the National Hotel soon became depopulated, for its old boarders either left the city or changed their quarters ; and asrunour, withitsthousandexaggerating tongues, carried the story in every direction, stranger guests soon learned to avoid the house. Ruin stared its proprietors in the faceruin, made doubly dark and hopeless by the thonsand idle stories as to the cause of the sickness, which discharged servants and other petty enemies embraced the occasion to circulate-thus not only destroying the business of the establishment, but creating the supposition that the sickness was a consequence of some culpable neglect or carelessness on the part of the hosts. It is but just to say that they took early measures to discover the cause of the sickness, and never remitted them for a dav.
But now there came a change. Soon after the middle of February the disease began to abate. Few or no now cases occurred, and there was a general improvement in the old omes. So marked was this favoarable change That by the last of the month the panic was allayed, public confidence was restored, and the National filed again to overflowing. It was while the house was thus crowded by those who thronged to witness the inauuration paeat that the
disease broke out again with, its original violence, and hundreds are still suffering in consequence; even countimg out the host of men who spent their week at Washing ton in scenes of reckless disspation, socking in bad rnm, turning night into day, and their stomaahs into swill-tubs -but ad of whom wil for all time to come declare that they were " poisoled at the National," and wonder at their providential escape.
Before proceeding to consider the various theories upon which different parties have accounted for the epidemic, let me remark that it was not confined exclusively to the National HoteL On the contrary, disease of the stomach and bowels was quite prevalent at the same time in different parts of the city,-disease accompaniet by precisely the saule group of symptoms, marked by the same malignity and obstinacy, and affected by the same classes of remedies. Among my own acquaintances I know of several cazes elsewhere. At Brown's Hotel there were quite a number soon after the January thaw; but they yielded readily to medical treatment. At Willard's Hotel there were several eases, although pains were taken to conceal the fact Among the sufferers at this house I may mention Dr. Chatfer, a representative in Congress from Massachusetts, who found it necessary to resort to very violent remedies to check the complaint. Persons doing business on the avenue near the National Hotel, and who were in the habit of frequenting the honss without partaking of food there, were similarly affected, and even the barbers who occupy a shop in the house, but had no other connexion with it, were forced to ' follow the fashion," These facts are imirt'nt vwhen we come to consider the cause of the disease, because they seem to furnish us as a basis of investigation the simple suggestion at least that there may have been at Washington same general cause producing irritation of the stomach and bowels, which, combined with some other local cause at the National Hotel, produced the serious aggravation of the symptoms in patients living at that house.
Let us now examine the theories upon which it has been sought to account for the troubles. To do so justly we must discard entirely the hundrcd reports to the effect that Jobn Smith who " ato a single meal at tho National," has since died, and that a posti mortem examination showed " half his stomach and kidneys to have been eaten away by arsenic." This sort of nonsense is at once discarded by every intelligent physician, and is entitled to no weight. If we seek to get at the truth it will be necessary to draw our deductions from well.established facts, for which we have some responsible author, rather than fromu these uncertain, indefinite rumours. The first thcory which obtained was based upon the rat-poisoning story which I exposed a few days ago. To recapitulate briefly,-It was said that arsenic had been used to rid the hotel of rats, that the vermin, having partaken of the poisoned bait, jumped into the water tank from which the house was supplied, and so administered to the guests the poison -which had already
murdered the four-footed animals. This story, originating I with a discharged serv.nt, And timed so as to be greedily I swaUowed by the panic-stricken sick-had no foundation. The tank in qaestion is utterly inaccessibleto vermin of any kind, and was carefully cleansed every day. Nor was the water from this tank used for drinking or cooking purposes, this being supplied direcv, in pines, froni a clear, sweet, and abundant spring which weUs out of the earth some hundredsof feet from the hoteL Besides, I msy say tha' the arsenic story never was credited by the Washington pbysicians, who found present none of the symptocis of poisoning by that dtug.
The next favourite theory was thai of copper poisoning, consequent upon the use of copper cooling utensils. This had for a time many disciples, including oDe or two physicians, although it also was repudiated by most of the faculty at Washington. Some of the boarders, including a wellknown gentleman of this city-all thoroughly convinced that the source of the trouble would be found in the kitchen, and fully prepared to see the cooking utensils covered with verdigris-constiluted themselves a committee to make examination. They reported at once that they fomnd the palace de cuissc in the beet possible condition,-the tables clean enough to eat from, the utensils nearly all tinned to prevent corrosion, and the entire department in excellent order. One of tie gentlemen thought be discovered sppearanos of verdigris m the greasy deposit which collected upon the sourt kettle just at the surface of the liqind compound then un ergoing the process of manufaeture. This, he feased, might resclt froi the wearing-off the tinning and the exposure of tbo copper in some spots in the soup kettle. Accordingly, he scraped up a quantity of the suspicious material lor further examination; but a careful analysis by Dr. Antisell, of tie Smithsonian Institution, failed to discoverthe least trace of copper. Other analyses by tbe doctor of selections made at the samnetimte from milk, meats, and game, failed to find anyy mineral poison whatever, or to discover any cause of disease. The result of his analysis of the water in use I shall refer to in mnother place.
This seemed to dispose of the copper theory; and, although I have conversed with ten or a dozen physicians who have attended the sulMrcrs by thia disease, I have found none who were entirely ready to accept that tleors es the true one, and few who wouls listen to-it at all
while all of them declare that the spmptoms woui be more likely to be produced by either of several other. cases. But these conclusions did nok_ satisfy the suffer-wa
tiat tiey were not poisoned. Sick, debil't;e, nervous. aud cross, many o them were Teternieeiadito be poissmed any!iow. Indeed, ii would seenu to have been a ]oiut of honour withthem to majintain, the idea, just as though to be sick without aid of arsenic or copper was equivalent,to disgrace. These got the notion, that some malicious wretch, envious of the prosperity of to. Louse, or some enemy of its proprietors, was infusing poison stcaltkily and regulhaly into the food at such times that discousry i;s difficult. The idloness of thissupposition is exposed by the fact that so mnany parties who never ato a moutV fPl1 in the house suffereA eurally with those who dined Maily. e-, sides it is iacredible that anybody having the opportunity to be guilty of so fiendish an act would have escaped the close Ecrutihy which was observed to deect any such
illany ; for if that is tho cause of the sick3%sm the admin
aistraticns of the poison must have been made at least threc times a-day for twro months past-else<howv happens it *that the progress of the disease has been so.stendJr, and its effects so nridversal and so lasting ?
Pinally, we COmelO to the theory which, for one, I have adopted after long, and, I confess it, somewhat emaciated consideration, and which it seems tome w-i commend itself to the judgment of those who bare followed me closely in rapid history of tho epdeumic, It is the theory which the physicians of Washingcss generally inaintain,and which has been vindicated by tfe Board of Health of that city. And, by the way, tfs Board made their first examination of the hotel on ' a abouttthe 20th of February. At that time their atten'iDa was not addres to the aubject of the sewer age, aid they reported unanimously that they could discover lto loal cautse of disease Now, upon thorough examuvinirion, they declare their conviction that the sickness is conseqsuent upon the uephiiic vapour genehrated in t he aewar, sik, and ceaspools connected with the hotel ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ete
The following, ataWsmai, I believ%, will 'estialt the acouracy of tjese eoou3Asions, wil bo found entirely coDsistqut 4. tJs, -will asccz,ed facts, aaCi
count for the greAta Wrevalence of the disease at the Nationxl, vtwitlfig g it was found elsewhere in the city at the satw 0 , iyftb*ont becoming epidemic in other localities. Eveqy tr2nger who goos to Washington is at fixlt gubject to rlasation of the bowels, and some. time,' to serious irritation. This is clearly traceable to the quaiity of the water, which is chiefly supplied by Eurface spzrings, and is highly charged wita earthy Falts, which make it, in fact, a modified mineral water. On the occasion of heary rains or thaws thig peculiarity is aggravated by the surface water flowing into the springs. Suddtn changes of temperature, subject.isg one to colds, and calculated to debilitate, are of themselves promotives of disorders of the digestive organs. When tbe disease biokle oat at Washington both these irritating canses were present-the thaw succeeding the great snow carrying quantlt0es of surface water to the springs, and the variable temperature and sudden cbasges of. weather contributing its quota of tlWe tronble. Dr. AntiseU, the chymist of the Smithsonian Inst itution, after s yring' the water at the time he did the soup, neat, &c., gave h-%

Irrigation Works In India.
IRRIGATIONIV WRKS Ir 1WDIr.
TO THE EDI-TOT1t OF THE TIME9-.
Sir,-Mly attention has lately been direct-d to somer powerfully written articles -which appeared'a few years-ago in Tle Timms on the subject of-irrigation worke.in.bidia. E rememberthattheseatthe timoafordedgreethopesnd encouragement to the friends of progress in our Esztern empire that. a matter of such importance would not longer be allowed to sleep when advocated by a jouTnal carrying with-it so much weight and influence. That they had the effeot of rousing: the apathy of the Government to,the necessity of exertion is weil knov;n. Minutes wero written, plans- considered, and works recomniended. Some of these have been executed, and others are in progress. Bat the great stumblingblock which obstructs all important philanthropic undertakmgs in Inidia- namely,no surplusrovenne and theconsequent wantof inoney-ha asusual, intezvened, to afford the Government sufficient excuse for.aot doing that which vwithout doubt they are well covvinced should be done, and that which they would do if they had tbe mieans. The attempt to raise money on loan at the usual ;nte of interest. hasproveda failure, and under.these circumstances, perhaps, we can scarcely attach blame to the Government that they should not have executed worls, requiring a large expenditure, even with the fair prospect that the expenditure might, within a very brief period, repiy itself. If, however, the Government have not the means at their own command to construct a system of works on which the de-elopment of the resources of the country depend, they. have the power of attracting those means from-this,.country, where ample capital exists, and of making the same available for the purposo in view.
In one of your leading articSes to which B bave above re-- ferred you express a hope " to see the day6 when, instead of Australian land orgopld companies, or6 touth Aierican mines, we shaU see in the London Share4ist the names oE Indian Irrigation Companies." But t:e years have.
lapsedsince these remarks wero penned, aud, although
innumerable companies have in the intezim sprung into. being for almost every other conceivable purpose, I am not. cognizant of one having. appealed to the support of the British public for the object of- irrigating.and making pro-
ductive the waste and uncultivated hinds of India. There ia . -sdoubtedly a reason, for this. What is it? It cannot be that such works will not. prove rnmuneratir, for the profit derived from, those.*at have beer, bronuht into operation almost exceeds belief. Thirty-nine works of irrigation in the Madras Presidency, undertaken =nd hept in repair by the Government, on which the cziginal expenditure. amounted to 53,0001., bave yielded within a few years an annual net profit of 6W.& per cent.,_.nd of these l have,
produced an annual returna of -1384 per-tent. Tako tha-greatwork of the Godavesy. Anicut, not bcluded in tbe above, regarding -which the a Madras Public Work ReDor' thus speaks :-" Even while the work, are in progress and far from being. completed, and while a large part oftheir effect r9 of neceasity stil undeveloped, te. direct returns in revenue have amaounted, taking each year's increase
of revenuc in compiirison with the whole o:penditue. up to that thine, to above 62- per-sent. per, Panman on the capital laid out; andthereis no.doubt',bateverthatthe fnture returrs will be enormously.larger.
And alU tbiw has been obtained, it. should be remembered, FIterally withount any outlay, without-any sncrifte of income whatever; for in every year of the progrem- of the work. the increase of rovenue has beenanaterially isencess of the exDenditure."
What- more romising field than tbesoefacts.reveal could. exist for the employment of British cz.pital? And where shall we look for equivalent- returns, with 13ss risk, less
delay, or less uncertainty ? Aseuredly thborewon why this. . ficld, of enterprise has not linag since b*en ocruried cannot asiso$rom the nature of the works themslves. To quote. thoewords of your own reviaw on Colonel Goeon's book onr publiecworhs- in India:-"What makes. these statement% 3ore. rema.-kable is that these extraordin.-ry successes are. ebeckered'by no failures. Whereven a work has been carefolly planined and inlrust-i to officers of co3upetent sl-dll, it has unifsrmly,succeeded when it bas. beea allowed to be brought- to completion."
The real difficnilty. which meets averut.niertaking sf this.
hind a4 the outsue istha positionin.,whic4 the Govenment - standa, in relation to works of irrigstioa, and th2.insur, mountable obstacle -which this. presents in the way ',f a. j'int-stock a'sooiatica worlin-an them successfull y unless

A letter from Constantinople of the 80th ult. Eay;g-
" The most important fact of tho week is the visit of tho Sultan to the Admiral's ship, the Royal Albert, His High. ness had announced his visit for Saturday, and preparations were immediately made for his reception. Ee was paid the usual honours; the men manned the yards, and received him with three hurrahs, while the bands played the national hymn of the Ottomans. His Majesty visited overy part of the vessel, and his attention was particularly at. tracted by the engine, which is of great power. He remained on board about an hour, and then returned in his caique, amid a salute of 21 guns, which was replied to by the batteries on shore.
" A telegraphio despatch from Bucharest having an. nounced that the Austrians, who began to move on the 22d, had quitted the Moldo-Wallachian territory, Admiral Lyons weighed anchor yesterday at half-past 5 o'clock, and proceeded to the Sea of Marmora, the Royal Albert leading the way, and the steam frigates following. There now remains only the Coquette gunboat.

The demand will be complied with, and steps have been taken for their return to Bulgaria without loss of time.

M. Dumont, statuary and member of the Institute, has been commissioned to execute a statue which the population of Mauritius are about to erect to the memory of their ancient Governor, Labourdonnaye. The real founder of that important settlement was Labourdonnaye, who was appointed Governor by the French Government in 1734. Previous to that date it had been almost entirely neglected for the Isle of Bourbon, and was in the most impoverished and abandoned condition. The new Governor at once perceived its importance, with its two excellent harbours, to the European Power having possession, as France then had, of India; and the exertions he made for its improvement were great and successful. Port Louis, where he fixed the seat of Government, was, in fact, created as well as fortified by himn. During the 11 years of his administration he rendered the isand a prosperous and valuable colony, and even after France had lost her Indian possessions Mauritlus continued to be of importance to her as a naval station. It is hardly necessary to say that Mauritius is the scene of the popular tale by Bernardin St. Pierre, Paul and Virginia. The wreck of the St. Geran, which forms the most interesting incident in the tale, really took place in August, 1744. Notwithstanding all his services in India and Mauritius, Labmnrdonnaye, like several other distinguished men o the same period, met with the most ungrateful and cruel treatment. On his return to France for the purpose of answering the charges of powerful enemies, set on by his persecutor, Dupleix, he w,as thrown into the Bastille, and remained a close prisoner several years without being allowed to make his defence. His mnocence was at ldst admitted, and he was set at liberty in 1752. But he was ruined in fortune and in health, and he died in 1755, the victim of the grossest wrongs. His memoirs, in which he recites the sad story of his misfortunes, were published in Paris in 1750.
Count de Persigny, French Ambassador to the Court of St. James's, is expected in Paris for the Easter holydays.

AUSTRIA.
(]romI oVB OWN CiBounm OlNDiNT.)
VIENNA, APR.IL 7.
Yesterday it was generaUy stated that an Austrian corps was about to be posted on theSardinian frontier but the Imperial Government neither has ordered nor intends to order troops to be concentrated on the western frontier of Lombardy. The Oesterreichische Zeitiuig of this morning has a leader on the subject, which merits attention, as it expresses opinions that are entertained in official cireles. The following is a brief summary of the article:
"As Austria is not fond of unnecessary demonstrations, sho will not place a corps of observation in the neighbourhood of tho Sardinian frontier. There is no good reason for supposing that the. camp which is about to be formed near- Alessandria is a demonstration against Austria. . The Sardinian fizitary Gazette expressly says that it is not, ' and the Turin papers are not in the habit of concealing their real oplinons.' The Turin Cabinet may, perhaps, think that the troops have been long enough in contact with democratical elements, and may consider it advisable to revive their military spirit by removing them from the larger cities to a distant camp. The presence of 20,000 Sardinian troops at a distance of a few miles from the frontier is not a oircumstance of such importance as to render it necessary that Austria should take awa counter-measure. Count Paar was recalled from Turin bcause his Government was exposed to the insults of the suemi-officia (o.flcose) organs of the press; but now that the point of honour has been properly cared for there is no reason why new misunderstandings should aris. As the camp at Alessandria will contain hardly one-fifth of the number of men that forms the Austrian armay i Italy, the Imperial Govermnent can well afford to ignore the 'evolutions? of the Sardinijas, whether they be political or military."
A short time after the Archduke Ferdinand M dimilian had taken pomession of the reins of Government he addressed a kind of circular to the authorities of the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom. The document has not been publisheed, but it is known that the GovernorGeneral directed hir, subordinates " to guide
the people, without putting them into leadingatrings, to keep them from transgresting against -the laws without fettering them." His Im ei3 Highness requires from all the employ&e placed under him " a prompt and conscientious discharge of their duties strict impartiality in their interpretation o? the law, truth and candour in their official reports, and a treatment of the public which shall be at once mild and worthy of persons acting in the name of the Sovereign." By the foregoing it is to be seen that the youthful prince has the best possible intentions, but persons who know the real state of things in the Lombardo-Venetian provinces are of opinion that he wil soon be heartily tired of his new post. The Ultramontane party is more powerful that ever in the Liombardo-Venetian kingdom, and the dislike of the people for the Roman hierarchy is almost as great on this side of the Ticino as it is on the other. Baron Burger, the Statdholder of Milan, Is said to be so completely in the hands of the clergy that he does nothing which could by any possibility give them umbrage.
On the 4th the baptism of Baron de Bourqueney's child took place at the Villa Metternich, and much flattered was Madame de Bourqueney at receiving from the veteran diplomatist who acted as godfather, a bracelet containing a medal on which is his portrait. The medal was intended only for the members of the Prince's family, but an exception was made in favour of the French lady, who, to use an Ultramontane expression, is in spiritual relationship with the sponsor of her child. The mention of Prince Metternich recalls to my memory an interesting fact. A few years ago, when the Prince was at Brussels, M. Thiers inquired whether he would be received if he called on him. As the courteous noble replied that he should be happy to see M. Thiers, the latter paid him a visit. The result of the interview is to ba seen in the last volume (the 15th) of the Histori of thie Cowsnlate and the Empire. The French historian wished to obtain from the celebrated statesman some information relative to the policy of Austria in 1812. The Prince desired M. Thiers to put on paper any questions which he raight wish to have answered. Some 12 or 13 questions were asked. To 10 of them the Prince gave a reply st once, and he subsequently procured from the Austrian Foreign-office documents which enabled him to answer the others.
Great preparations are being made by the Eungarians for the reception of the Emperor, and the municipality of Peath intends to erect a temporary pavilion for the reception of their Maesti which will cost about 5,0001. Prince Paul Esterhazy has ordered four splendid uniforms for his body-guard, and rumour says that he has resolved to astonish their Majesties by the magnificence of an entertainmnent which he wi give them at one of his numerous castles, The approaching change in the currency will subject the creditors of Austria and Bavaria to a loss. In Bavaria the loss on every 1,000 fiorins will bs2 flori, and in Austria it will be even greater. The Vienna papers state that Sir ffamilton Seymour has received leave of absence, but such is not the case. The British tMinister is Just at present very much occupied, and could not possibly quit his post; at least, the Austriaus say so, and they generally know pretty well what the resident diplomatista are about.

MADRID, APRIL 5,
We have entered the annual decade of fleshly mortifications-black dresses, tolling bells, salt fish, and solemn faces. On two days of the week now commencing no vehicles are allowed to circulate in Madrid-a prohibition which gives a strange and unnatural stillness to a capital where generally there is a good deal of cart and carriage traffic. The promenades in the Retire and Prado are the onlypastime the austerity of the season leaves to the belles and dandies of Madrid. In the evening the music and ftniones, pomps and ceremonies in the churches, attract crowds. The theatres are all closed for 10 days. The Teatro Real, where Italian opera exclusively is given, has been particularly good this year. After this week it opens again for a month, but with diminished forces. Two of the best of ita singers are now on their road to the Haymarket, where, if east winds and London fogs do not detec,iorate their tones, they can hardly fail to give great satisfaction. Mademoiselle Ortolani is a young and very agreeable singer, whose voice is of pleasing freahness and quality, and who in 'parts wel adapted ' her leaves little or nothing to be desired. She has been particularly successful here in Rigoletto and Lucia, and her style of singing will,It think, be liked in England. Vialletti, the 6asso ,rofonwdo, who is also engaged by Mr. Lumley, hasbeen here several seasons, and is deservedly a favourite, both as a singer and actor. His Bertram in Robert le Diable is considered the best that has ever been heard here. He takes with him on his journey northwards the applause and good wishes of his numerous Madrid admirers, and some magnificent diamond shirt-buttons, sent to him by the Queen just before his departure.
The Bolsa is closed to-day.

French and English International Fat Cattle Show.
_FRE2OC and BNGLIlS r NieRxA4Io)
FAT CA TTLE SHOW.I
PARIM, APRIL 9.
On Wednesday, the show being opened to the public at 9 o'clock, a very large number of Deople asembled to inspect the best animals that Prance can produce, and to wonder at the fatness1 and comely proportions of the English cattle when compared with those exhibited by French grazier3. Among the company were the Baron de Beville, Count Kergolay, MM. Lefevre de Sainte-Mlarie, Gareau, Tisserand, Baroche, De Monseignat, Buadement, Porlier, F. R. de la Trehannais, &a., and Messrs. Fisher, Hlobbs, W. Torr, R. Stratton, A. Harvey, C. Stevenson, John C. Morton, ani many other distinguished French and British agriculturists. His Excellency M. Rouher, the iinister of Agriculture, visited the show yesterday and minutely inspected ell the various dasses.
As far as we can judge at present the gathering is eminently successfuL If, on the one hand, there is a falling off in some classes, particularly English sheep, on the other hand there are very many remarkably good animals, both of Eniglish and native cattle, while the show of pigs is both large and meritorious. All animals sold are to be butchered at the Paris abatoirs, and the Show Committee are to be furnished with every information necessary for determining the weights of the several parts of each animal, which, combined with the knowledge of the breed and the manner of feeding will be of great service in pointing the attention of French farmers to the value and economy of inproved;descriptions of livestock. The French are not admirers of fat meat, but they are great consumers of milk and butter, so that we must not criticize their breeds with the predilections of an English grazier and stall-feeder. Still, we perceive among animals of tremendous frame, or coa-se unkindly quality, many possessing elementa of great improvement as regards their fatting capability; and some of the crosses with English breed show, in a very marked degree, the advantage as well as indicate the mneans of such improvement.
The classes are aranged geographically, so that cattle of one breed sometimes appear in various parts of the yard, and each district has two or more classes for diffierent breeds or ages.
The "FirstDistrict," including Normandy and other provinces where estates are larger than in other parts of France, and the breeding of cattle and agricultural improvements generally can be cad-ed out on a considerable scale, has contributed some very good specimens both of pure and crossed breeds. The Prince de Waoram's short-horn and Swiss, and Count de Torcy's ox, which obtains the prize of honour, are exceedingly good animals, well proportioned, fine in bone and in quality of flesh, beautifully fed, and possessing both size and handsome appearance. Two good white Charolais, short, compact animals, having a better "round" than "rumap" of beef, and two of the Flamand breed, of very large frame and capable of much improvement, are noticeable in this class. The prize Comtois ox of M. VaillantLaby (Nord) haa very good meat and a broad level back, contrastin v we with another of the same breed in winch the ribs slope off miserably from the backbone. A Cotentin, five years old, of enormous size, extraordinary depth of carcass, and rather symmetrical in form, is shown by x. Adeline (Calvados). The two shorthorns of M. Grasourdy (Orne) and the shorthorn and Manceau of M. :idard (Ome) are very well formed, long, wide, and nicely proportioned, particularly excellent i
capacity of chest and outspringing rib, and with a kindly touch, having the smnall and handsome head and fine bone which render them in quality worthy of an English show.
In the " Second District," and class of beasts four years old and upward, the crosses of shorthorn and Normandy and shorthorn and Manceau are the best, a shorthornt and Breton being also very free from that heavy bone which dlstirnuishes so many of the pure native breeds. Of the pure French, more than four years old, none are really fat; the small Breton blac and white oxen are narrow, and far from symmetrical; the Nantois, almost of a fawn colour, perhaps of the nicest quality. M Grifin's (Maine-et-loire) two red Salers cattle are very good in some points ; M. Orieum (Vend6e) takes the Poissy prize for a Choletais of considerable merit, remarlkably good in the hind-quarters; and in this class, also is a Manceau ox from the department of Maine-et-ioire of most colossalmammoth-likedimensions, but correapondingly plainand coarse in character. Several Choletais cattle in this class exhibit great substance and depth of carcass, and are evidently calculated for attaining to a considerable weight without an undue proportion of bone. M. Rivet's (Maine-et-Loire) prize Choletais is very level, wide across the hips and chine, nicely made up in most points, and decidedly very creditable, both to the breeder and feeder. The Parthenais gray or fawncolouredcattle are capable of very much improvement. The Manceau, crowsed with the short horn has made a very weighty ox,, with finer flesh and the property of earlier maturity, than pertain to the orignal breed.
In the "third district" the Garonnais are at once recognized as the breed which, with the Charclais, are often seen in England; and, indeei, these two breeds possess, perhaps, more than any other that compactness of shape, full chest, and chine, and freedom from coarse bone or tbick skin which may be developed into the characteristics of our Durhams or small Herefords. Some of theLimousin, Garonnais, and other light-yellow or buffe-oloured cattle are very badly shaped, with high shoulders, hollow backs, and pla:n heads. One cross of the shorthom with Limousin is a great advance upon the original form and quality, this breed being capable of improvement, especially by aiming at finer frame and thinning off the excess of "superphosphate" in favour of a larger proportion of good meat. A Cotentin ox in this class is of enormous size, with wonderfully heavy bone and a tremendous head. Certainly breeds which yield such gigantic specimens as this need only to be judiciously crossed with finer qualities in order to secure what is so much desirednamely, great size combined with rapidity of fattening. Two Gascon cattle in this class, of a yellow-brown colour, with horns turned up in a lyre-like form, have a handsome appearance, and pretty fair quality of meat. A Limousin and Garonais cross is shown, of considerable size, but too much of the buffalo in its form; the prize cross between the same breed is much more shapely. A cross between Garonne and Swiss is one of the plainest animals in the yard, very coarse in frame, with a high shoulderand neck-chine, ponderous legs, a thick hide, and a huge hanging bely, betokening a property of devouring much food without a compensating return in beef.
In the "Fourth District," M. MNichel's (HauteVienne) shorthorn and shorthorn Limousin are of very good quality, and in this and some other examples in the class the wonderful improvement of the shorthorn cross, when compared with the pure breed, is very apparent. The Limousin cattle from the department of the llaulte-Vienne are distinguished for their great length and less bone than others of the same general breed.
The "Fifth District" comprises some good beasts, particularly a white Charolais-exucedingly good in many points,-the meat of firm and beautiful quality, back level broad and well-covered, form
very compact and symmetrical, and head very handsome. The majority of oxen in this division, and indeed, in all, are only just butcher's meat, and are astonishingly inferior to the English stock as respects their fatness. Two Bourbonnais, no less than 8 years old, shown in this class, are large unwieldy beasts, with legs and joints massive as those of an elephant, and having little enough of beef upon their ribs, in spite of their bulky dimensions.
The "Sixth District" contains some moderately compact-made good Charolais, and some inferior Comtols, together with a very exceUent shorthorn Manceau.
In the class for lots of 4 each are some very good shorthorn crosses, some excellent Charolais, some small Breton cattle of really good quality, from the department of Loire-Iif6rieure, contrasting very favourably with others from Finisterre, which are very poor. The red Salers and red Auvergiat cattle, both of large frame, from the department of Maine-et-Loire, and the small white and yellvw Nivernais from the department of Nievres, are all capable of great improvement in form and feeding qualities.
The class of calves number 16, principally of the Cotentin breed, from the Seine-et-Oise, one or tiro being exceedingly good in form and forward for their age.
The only foreign cattle beside the Brltish eodsa
of two of a Hungarian breed, which were not con-- sidered worthy of a prize. They are of t giayishwbite colour, have sbarp backs, thin curved neocks
maud Ioiig stratht horns, in a V form, and remind one of the antelope rather than a domestic barn-door bullcik.
The sheep -ate hr lots of 20 each-in classes for young sheep, morinas, and half-bred merinos, longwools, and short-wools. Some of the inerinos are very good, only one lot having on the fleeca superfine wool, for which they are so celebrated The prize pen of half-bred merinos are shapely and handsome, but with the characteristic defects of the breed; and one lot, on the other hand, has these defects in an extravagant degree-the backs being sharp, loins high, necks reminding one of the deer or giraffe, the skin wrinkled in thick folds in front of the shoulder, and the leather dewlap depending li-e the pouch of a pelican, being too indicative of unldndly feeding properties and the wasting of too much weight in offal proportionately to the amount of good mutton. The greatest attraction consists of the two prize pens of Dishley-
Ierino3, those of M. Pilat (of Pas-de-Calais) obtain. ing the silver cup. The latter are a perfectly even lot, beautiful in form and character, with very good mutton ; the former have also great size and substance, fine heads and legs, and some very firm good meat. They far surpass in merit the English Southdowns brought to the show; indeed, it is surprising what a different shape is revealed to the eye when the Down show-sheep are stript of their close covering of wool, from the level backs, expanded forequarters, and other admirable points which artistic clipping has previously assisted to produce. The mall Artesiena, from the Pas-de-Calais, with specked faces and legs, have beeni improved by crossing with English sheep, but are very far inferior to the improved merino, beng poor and verynarrow, with long thin necks. The Berrichons from the Loire-et-Cher, after crossing, retain too much the form of the " soda-water bottle ;" and the Southdown Picards, from the Pas-de-Calais, are very deficient behind the shoulder. The prize-crossed B3errichons, from the Seine-et-Marne, are certainly very fair in quality.
We add only a few words as to the show of pigs, numbering 65 entries. The white Normandy breed assemble in greatest numbers, and the priz animal of M. Gilbert (Seeie-et-Omse) is a beautv, very well covered with good pork, and uncommonly good for its age-only 10 months. The secondpri7e pig is of great size, and has beautiful quality and long fine hair. One animal in the pure-breed class, of the Normandy kdnd, is a complete contrast to the former, having a long coarse snout and rough spinelike bristles, and too much of the forest character about it to be profitable in a modern farmstead.
Among the foreign and cross-bred pigs are some beautiful Berkshire and New Leicesters and Berkshires. M. Allier's (Seine-et-Oise) second prize pig is extraordinarily fat for its age. The prize pig of ML Pavy (Indre-et-Loire), of Middlesex br ea, is exceedingly well-fed and of excellent proportions and quality; one of the New Essex or Fisher Hobbs's breed, shown by M. Allier, and several other pigs, show that English breeds are being extensively introduced upon French farms, as well as effecting great improvements in the French swine by crossing.
We looked in vain for any collection of implements, steam-thrashing machines, or even for a stall of specimen seeds and produce, such as generally accompany our own fat-stock exhibitions. Would such an addition to the Show, as specimens of French farm-implements and produce, have been less interesting and instructive than a vast array of flags and the parade of a military band?

Sir,-I enclose for your edification the answer whicb has been drawn up to the late BishoD of Norwich's addres3. Finding much fault in a-late article with Bishop Hinds as a bishop, you could find none with his address; and that you were right in this respect is proved by the fact that High and Low Church all agree that that address is chaste in expression and beautifully touching in diction. To answer it there are some 1,200 clerles in this diocess, and among so mnany the public had a right to expect such an answer as ought to emanate from a body of highly-educated men. But what is the fact? An answer is drawn up by some half-dozen of our dignitaries, and sent forth "with authority" to the great body of the clergy to be signed, which is vapid, poor, inefficient, and scarcely grammaticaL Ishould not, Sir, have troubled you had I not felt, with scores of others, that some protest should be made, and that the clergy as a body should not be considered responsible for the thing put forth.

Sir,-May I ask you to say a word for poor M Seacole ? There has been a subscription got up for her which is yet In its infancy, but I miss many names on the list which ought to have been inter primwo. And for what does Mrs. Seacolo deserve a subscription? For courage, devotion, gooddess of heart, public service4, great losses undeservedly incued. I have seen her go down under fire with her little store of cr. ature comforts for our wounded men, and a more tender or skilful hand about a wound or a broken linmb could not be found among our best snrgeons. I saw her at the assaults on the Redan, at the Battle of the Tchernaya, at the fall of Sebastopol, laden, not with plunder, good old creature I but with wine, bandages, and food for the wounded or the prisoners. Her hands, too, performed the last offices for some of the noblest of our slain. Her hut was surrounded every morning by the rough navvies and Land Transport men, who had a faith in her proficiency in the healng art, which she justified by many cures and b removing obstinste cases of diarrhea, dysentery, and similar camp maladies. These are facts for the world at large, not for any officer of the Crimean army, to whom they are known already. If this poor woman had boen paid what Bhewas owed-if she hadbuttheamountof the '"little bills" cashed by her In the Crimea, and not paid at home, she would need no subscription; but she has been unfortnate, not only in these respects, but she has been deceivod and robbed by one in whom she placed tust and confidence.
I hope the public, as weU as the army, will give enou h to Mrs. Seacole to, set her up-late in life, poo soul ! though it e,i is all she asks-for a fresh start in the world, and that as she was liberal and kind, so may she receive a Idnd and liberal tupport.

BERLEN, Ar8
The six armne corps, as the xix infantry corpx &e now called, were mentioned in a preceding letter a5 composing the " First Army ;" there is, however, no longer any "' Second Army," and all bodies of troops not directly attached to this first main army are designated as "separate corps." The forraer terms, " Active," " Central," "West," and "South Army," have ceased to have any significance or application, since all have been united with thename of First Army, under the command-in-chief of Prince Michael Dmitriewitech Gortschakoff I., Adjutant-General, General of Artillery, and Stadtholder of Poland. The propriety of superseding the designation of infantry corps with thati of armee corpsseemstohave beenrinducedby thecircumstance of the additional brigade of dragoons having been attached to it, by which alteration the proportion of eavalry to infantry in a regular armfe corps-viz., six regiments of horse, to 12 regiments of foot-has been attaineod
The union of the Guard and of the Grenadier corps under one common commander has also been done away with; and each of these bodies of troops forms now A "separate corps." The higher charge3 in the army Altogether, and more particularly the enormous staffi with which they were accompanied, have been very much simplified. The post of Com. mander of brigades, whether of infantry er of eavalry, has been abolished throughout the army, with the exception of the separate Corps in the Caucasus, where they are still filled by M1ajorGenerals. The Generals of Brigade have been attached to the Generals of arw,e corps and Divisions, as Assstant-Generals (Pomoschtschik), and subor dinated to them. There is at least o,e such p1o moAchtschiQ attached to every division of infantry, and to every division of light cavalry two, a senior and junior Ponoschtschik. In addition to the simplification of the routine of business thus attained the retrenchment of expense must also be very considerable, for there are about 80 posts of Brigadier. Generals thus swept away, together with their bureaur, adjutants, orderlies, rations, &c.
In addition to the Assistant-Generals,each division of infantry and cavalry has a chef of the staff, under whose control the staff of the division with the usual personnd stands ; on the other hand, the very numerous staffs that were formerly attached to each arm6e corps, have been abolished, and thus the Commander of Division has become much more independent. Throughout all the changes in this branch of the service the intention is apparentthat in future there shall be less red-tapery kept up by the staffs; while, on the other hand, the miii tary command is exercised much more directly, and is not so liable to be weakened by intervening instances.
There havo also been changes effected in the separate Caucasian corps; the Brigade of Caucasian Grenadiers of the Reserve has been extended into a divisionof CaucasianGrenadiers ;theformerconsisted of aregimentoi GrenadiersandoneofOarabineers, but the latter is composed of four regiments of Grenadiers. The two regiments here added have been formed out of the 41st and 42d regiments of infan try, which composed the 2d Brigade of the 21st Divi
sion of Infantry; and in the places of these latter the two new regiments " Crimeal' and " Sebastopol' have been raised. The total number of regiments of infantry thus remains unchanged-viz., 84 With regard to the frontier battalions attached to this corps (Grasian, Black Sea,'and Caucasian), it is to be noticed ithat Ithe 16 battalions Black Sea have been reduced to six; but whether this has been occasioned by losers during the war or by draughting the men off into the two new regiments, Crimea and Sebastopol, is not clear.1 The reserve, which has been thrown into abeyance throughout the rest of the army, is still in ful force in this "separato corps." It consists of a reserve brigWde of Grenadiers, a reserve brigade of infantry for each of the 19th, 90th, and 21st Divisions of In4ntry, and a half-brigade for the 37 frontier battalions. The existence of the reserve battalion of Rifles, in the separate Caucasian corps has already been mentioned.
While speaking of the frontier battalions, it may be mentioned that of latejtwo Cronstadt frontier battalions have been raiseda and attached to the Guard; that there still exist, as before, 10 battallions Orenburg, 12 Siberian, and 4 East Sibe. rian,-all attached to the respective separate corps. On the other hand, the former 22 Finland battalians have been reduced to 10. In all these frontier battalions the hitherto existing organization of brigade has been retained.
On the whole, although a considerable number of new regiments have been formed, it does hot appear that any material increase has taken place in the Russian standing army; on the other hand, the reserve and supplementary bodies of troops which had been raised for the term of the war have all been disbanded, and of this whole reserve force there exists now in connexion with each armUe corps only the cadre, or skeleton, of a division of reserve infantry under the command of a lioutenant-general, with a major-general as his deputy or assistant. The sole exception to this is formed by the divisions of Artillery, which still retain their reserve brigades extant and active. The 12 reserve regiments of the Infantry of the Guard, 12 ditto Grenadiers, each consisting of three battalions, together with the 84 reserve regiments of infantry (First Army), each consisting of two,reserve and two supplementary battalions, making altogether 408 battalions, have all been disbanded. To these latter must be added the reserves of the different kinds of cavalry and the whole militia of the empire. But, although the troops of the reserve have been disbanded, the syatem of the reserve organization has not been abandoned, but, on the contrary, retained, and every care is being bestowed on it to bring it, if possible, to perfection. On the whole this system is considered itd Russia to have worked well; succh imperfections as have shown themselves are not looked on as outweighing the many great advantages it offers-such, for instance, as the facilities it gives for forming new battalions for the Active Army.
One of my informants to whom I am indebted for the above particulars of the changes that have taken place of late in the external organization of the Russian army assures me further that a no less
remarkable chango has taken place in the mnorale of the army. The intellectual activity of the military,
in common with the general spirit of the whole nation, is described as in a state of rapid development, and the army is said to have already arrived at a consciousness of its having entered upon a new phase of its history.

hich really begin to form a morst attractive feature of the exhibition. Yesterday the Sheffield andBirmingham courts, and the Cour belongtn; to Xr.Holt and Me 81-s,Ela on were crowded with adrming 'vitorx. The Ceramic Court, with its chef Bceurres of Savres aud Worcester, was also thronged, and an exquisite plaque from the latter place, in imitation of the Limoesenmel, and representing a soene from Dante, deservedy atimeted great approbation. At the tropical end of the buildiag, where the bark of the mammoth tree has been erected, there was of course a great crowd to gaze upon that colossal specimen lof Transatlantic vegetation. Thia tree, in -comparison with which the great Adonsonias of Cape Verd seemndwarfed to mere saplings is from California. about 23G miles from San Frandisco and 15 fromthe diggings ofIffurphy'aCamp. About 80 ofthera have been there found towern high over a11 round them, and each are known to the go7d-Ugger by some peculiar name more or less appropriate. There is he "Miners, Cabin,' 300 feet high and 80 in circumference, nmd the "Picneera' cabin," which has been half blown down, but still rears a monstrous jagged stnump, 150 feet into the air. The "Three Sixters," the most perfect in the grove, grow from one root, and are upwards of 300 feet high each. The "Old Bachelor" is a forlorn looldngvegetable, standiuigquite alone, 'with a rough andragalookingbark. The "Father of the Grove," as he is called was blown down, it is supposed, in some great hurricane many years ago, and now "lies supine, extending many a rood." The height of this monstrous tree wa no less than 450 feet, and down its trunk, which is hollow, a man can ride on horseback, it is sid, for more than 100 feet. Near this gigantic trunk grows the "Old Maid," with a "beggarly array " of withered leaves, and her head, unliko any other tree in the grove, entirely bare and bowed, as if with grief. There is also the Hermit, 320 feet high i the " Green Mountain," 350 ditto; and the " Siamese Twins," which have one colossal trunk nearly 60 feet diameter, but separate at some 50 feet above the earth, and then tower high into the air. The bark of the tree which is now at the Cryst Palace was called the "Mother of the Forest." Its full height was M3 feet, diameter at base 31 feet; judging by its conoentric rings botanists fix its age at 4,000 years-an almost fabulous antiquity for a tree which wa so lately green and flourishiDg. According to this estimate it must have been growing when.Nineveh was a mere collection of tents, and ere the captive Jews had begun their laboura on the Pyramids. The bark which is now erected at Norwood was cut from the tree in pieces eielt feet Ion
each was rearked and numbered as it came off, so that the whole is now fastened together precisely as it stood for tens of centuries on the slopes of the Sierra Nevada. The thickness of the bark is 18 inobes, and tlke weight of the 90 feet erected at the Palace nearly 60 tons.
The very Curious and hideous mud-fish, from the river Gambia, which was kept in an aquarium at this end of the Palace, has behaved quite characteristically since his arrival in this country. Some time ago he escaped from his tank, and wandered none knew whither. The other day, however, while cleaning out the large flower fountain at the north end of the building, the mud-fish was found at the bottoms grown twice as large, having passed his leisure time since his escape In devouring the imimense quantity of gold and silver fish with which the fountain was stocked.
Neither wine nor malt liquors were sold in the Palace during the hoer, of afternoon service. This arrangement appeared not a little to surprise and disappoint the public, and, if one might judge from the expressions now and then let fall, seemea to give rise to anything but a pious turn of thought among those who from the countets moved thirsty away. The picture gallery and the gardens were much vislted, especiallT that part of the latter where Mtr. Peters has established his archery ground, and where a crowd of ardent young bowmen contended all day long for the honour of shooting nearest to the target. The practice was not bad, the extensive sloping bank of earth on which the targets stood being repeatedly struck.
The Crystal Palace Company's band and t!he band of the Coldstream Guards were in attendance throughout the day, and performed a carefully selected programme with their usual taste and skill. The conduct of all among the immense crowd of visitors appeared, as far as we could see or hear, to be unexceptionable.

The Transit.
THE TBANSIT.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I was lookhng out for it,but it has ariived soonEr than I expected I M old young friend the Transit has knocked a hole in her bottom, and has entered a suicidal protest against going to China, coupled with an ominous sort of hint as to what she will doif the authord±ies force her on the voyage. Of course it was a pure accident, but as of unlucky generals so of znlucky ships-don't use them, should they be the best in the world. If, however, the Admiralty be, as it generally is, obstinate, then I suggest that Sir Charles Wood, whose love of a eaefaring life and nautical acquirementa are well known, should go out in the Trransit as a sort of material guarantee that the Adniralty believe in the good ship; or, if he be too valuable, or if his departure for the time should be taken as a vote of want of confidence, let them aeud out some other member of their body not desirable to be got rid of, whose appearanoe on board would be a perpetual "1 cave" to the offioer of the Watch, and a comforting assur. ance to the passengers.
No ship shouid be allowed to knock a hole in her botonm on the fluke or stock of her own anchor. She ws in a tideway, and the officers should. have known when she would swing, and how mtnuc waterwould be under her. When we see the officers of the merchant service sloins this sort of thing we shall begin to think they are unavoidable, but I ihould like to know what Mr. Cuaard, or the Penuar and Oriental or the West India Mha C nr, otay of our great puliie eo03

The Late Colliery Explosion Near Barnsley.
DiE LATE COLLIERY PXPLOSION NEAR
BARNSLEY.
The coroner's inquiry into tlhe circumstances of this (xplosion, by which no less thau 180 persons have lost their .iveS, was resumed before M.r. Badger at the Brampton Bull's Head Ion on Thursday, when Mr. Joseph Cue, the viewer and underground mana.-r of the colliery, was examined. Mr. Morton, the Goveruneict Inspector of Mines, the proprietos, and other gentleuiesn were present, as at previous sittings. The inquiry has now occupied seven days, during which 47 witnesses have been examined.
;The evidence with regard to the circmnistances immediately attending the explosion, and as to the condition and managemont of the mine prior thereto, beiing now exhausted, we lay beforu our readers a view of the whole case up to that point in the subjoined digest of the evideuce.
-A few preliminary explanations may render the evidence more generally intelligible. The LundhiUl, like most other large pits, has a " drawing shaft," up which tho coals are drawn, and through which the miners descend and ascend. The air enters the pit through this shaft, and returns up a ventilating or "up-cast" shaft, 40 yards distant. There is a third shaft, which, however, only extends to a seam or bed of coal some distance nearer the surface than Ihe one which was being worked. WYhen the air reaches the bottom of the drawing or " downcast" shaft it is divided and carried in different directions, and by various con' trivances, all over the workings before it reaohes the ventilatingshaft. Among these contrivances are "trap-doors," "stoppings," "brattice-boards,""pack-walls," &. In those parts of the pit where the workings are in the rmore advanced stages the ventilation is effected by the carrent being turned up one airway and down another, and as there are a large number of airways of various descriptions running both parallel and crosswise of oach other, barriers have to Ib erected, more especially in the principal roads, to divert tho air up the crossorads. When these barriers havo to be p'aced in roads along which coals have to be constantly conveyed to the shaft they assume the shape of doors, and are known as "trap-doors." Boys are generally employed to open and shut these doors as the corves pass, anid are caUed " trappers." When the barriers have to be placed in parts not used for egress they assutme the shape of walls, careEflUy plastered so as to be air-tight, and are caled " stoppings." In drifts,-namely, long recesses (whether they be " boardgates," which are made for main roads, and are some yards wide; or whether they be the narrower " slits," " headings," &c., which are recesses running from the boardgates at right angles)-that part which is beyond the last point of communication with other recesses is ventilated by placing a partition of boards along it, not less than two feet from one side, so that the air passes up one side of the partition and down the other. This partition is caUed " brattice " or "bratticing." "Pack-walls" are erected at the sides of the " goaves" (namely, those parts of the pit from which the coal has been got), and are for the twofold purpose of supporting the roof, so as to preserve roads and aircourses between the goaves and the unworked coal, and to carry air to the men who are working "banks" (breadths of coal) up the sides of the goaves. The " face " or " facing" is that end of a drift (whether "bank," "boardgate," "slit," &c ) where the coal is boing got, and is consequiontly furthest from the ventilating current, and to carry the current to which " bratticing," &c., is used.
* In the foUowing digest it has not been at all attempted to follow the order of the witnesees, but to take up the various points raised in the inquiry, and deal with them in the order likely to render them most inteligible to the general reader.
The explosion occurred about 20 minutes after 12 o'clock cn Thursday, the 19th of February, while oporations were auspended for dinner. Nearly four hours elapsed before any one reached the bottom of the shaft to attempt the rescue of the persons who were in the pit. Those who did deseend found the coal on fire aronnid the bottom of the ventilating shaft. Between 7 and 8 o'clock an immense fame burst from the top of the ventilating shaft, and before 9 o'clock the mouths of the downcast shafts were closed, as the only means of cutting off the current of air by which the flames were fanned into fary, X nd arresting the progress of the fire which threatened the destruction of the pit. At 'his time only 19 of the 208 persons in the pit at the time of the explosion, had been rescued, and the closing of the shafts cut off aU hope with regard to the fate of the remaining 189.
From the testimony of Mr. Maddison and Mr. Webster (managers of adjacent collieries), and of other witnesses, whose evidence we published some tinie ago, it appeared that no unnecessary delay took place in descending into the pit after the explosion; that the dozen men who undertook the hazardons task of exploring the pit made every possible effort with a view to the rescue of any who might be stiUl alive, and did not leave the pit until, so extensave and vehement had the fire become, there was the greatest danger of a colapse of one or more of the shafts. AIso, that it was not decided to close the mouths of the downcast shafts until that course had become indispensable to the safety of the pit, and until, in their opinion, no hope remained that any of the persons left in the pit were stilU aive, and all chance of rescue was at an end, even if they had been alive.
Statements have since been made aUeging unnecessary delay in descending the shaft after the explosion; and several witnesses (one of whom had addressed a letter of accusation to a Sheffield newspaper) have been examined. It appeared that the charge was wholly without foundation. The remaining part of the evidence with which we now proceed to deal has reference principally to the state and management of the pit previous to the explosion, and to the cause of the calamity.
Twenty-three of the witnesses examined were miners employed in differents parts of the pit u1) to the morning of the explosion. All of t hem, withonlythrceor four exceptions, spoke of the general ventilation of the pit Ps excellent, saying that they had considered the pit generally as safe as any in which they ever worked, and that they had always plenty of air in their own particular workplaces. Two or three of them even said that they had ha(l to complain of the current of air being too strong and "swealiDg" (wasting) their candles, but never of having too little air. Those who left the pit, as nearly aU of them did at different hours on the morning of the explosion, also stated that the pit appeared to be in as good a state as usual in every respect at the time they came out. A few of tho men, however, had special complaints, and from others Mr. Morton, the Government inspector, elicited admissionJ of what were pronounced to be irregularities-namely infringements of the rules adopted and approved by the Secretary of State for the working of the pit.
Rule 4 requires that "the underviewer (underground steward) or his deputies (locally calld ' fire triers') shaU daily examine every working-place with a safety lamp before the miners descend." The Lundhill pit has been worked by day and night "shifts" (or turns), and four " deputies" were employed, two for the day shift and two f.-r te night shift. Three of these only-namely, John Warhurst, Richard Corbridge, and Benjamin Beevers-survive, tho fourth deputy (William lliogworth) having perished in the pit. From the evidence of the survivors it appears that the above requirement had been in the main complied with. Beevers, however, who was on the night shift during the wveek of the explosion, and examined the workings on one side of the pit while Warhurst examined those on the otber side, said he did not examine all the working-places, hut only those in which men were going to work that cvening. On being told by Mr. Morton that there was very important need for his visiting all the woskplaces, witness replied that Warburst generally visited the remainder after the men had begnn work; but he (witneKs) acted under tho orders of Warhurst. Rule 4 further requires that the miners shall not be allowed to descend the shaft " until it has been signalled from the bottom that theunderground works have been examined." It appeared, however, that the miners had been alowed to descend the shaft, but not to leave the bottom of it before the signal was given.
Rule 9 requires that one of the deputies on the night shift shall remain in the pit " to see the deputy coming on the day shift, and report to him whatever may require attention." Beevers said he believed this requirement had not been complied with, himself and Warhurst, who were on the night shift, having left the pit at 3 o'clock in the morning, which was an hour before the arrival of the depu. ties on the day shift.
The evidence of the deputies was to the effect that they had examined the "goaves," as required by Rule 6- m,mely, twice a-week, though some of the miners said they had been for considerable periods and not seen the goaves examined. They, however, admitted that the goaves might have been regularly examined when they were not at work.

ness as to whether the deputies had visited them during eachshift. Whiam odge said they adnotalwaysvisited him, as did alo some othes one mainer stating that he did mnot report that a "blowe" occured in his workplace about 7 o'clock on the evening before the explosion, because he did not see any deputy between that hour end 3 o'clock next morning, when he left the pit. Some of these witmesses admitted that the deputies might visit their workpisces during some part of the shift when they were a¢sent. Othfer witnesses said they were visited- by a deputy dusing every shift, besides having their workplaces examined before they went to work.
Mr. Benjamin Sellars, mineral surveyor, made a tstrvey of the pit about a fortnight prior to the explosion; and accordingtobhis testimony themine was judiciously divided into four distrits for thepurposesof ventilation, andthe currents of air were fairly distributed; so much so at the faces of the leading banks or "benks" and the extremities of the levels and boardgate, that he felt as safe there as in the jury room, The pit was in as good a state of yentilation as any he had seen in the neighbourhood. He was 'also of opinion that the "sepopings" were well and substantially butlt ; indeed, there had never been any quaestion on that point. Mr. Sellars, however, was of opiniosi that the arrangements with regard to the furnace were not ijdicious. The furnaces in ooalmines are placed close to tie bottom of the ventilating shaft, the object being to promote theourrent of air through the pit. Astbegacesemitted bywthe coal throughout the workings are carried off by the currents the air, especialuy in tho csem of "fiery" seams (i,e. seams un 'air miht havo frely i t t he n it n sily charged

the furnace. He admitted that in a number of the pits I

From the evidence of John Goodison, the survivor of two n,en whose sole duty it had been to attend to the furnace It appeared that the rule which requires that the fmrnace tenser on duty shall never leave his post until another arrives to relieve him, and that the farnace shall never at any time, night or day, Sunday included, be left without an attendant, bad been strictly complied with. Witness also stated that he had alvays kept the furnace clear and burniDg briskly, and never saw any blue fame over the furnace, or any other indication whatever that the air passing over it was impregnated with eases to a dangerous extent. There was also the evidence of Deputy Corbridge, that less than half an hour before the explosion he saw the furnace, and it was then " all right."
Samuel Abbott, a miner, complained that the pit was not rightlyventilated; and, on que6tions being put, it was fonund that his complaint in particular was, that there were only single $-trap-doors" at the beardgate ends where in his opinion, there ought to have been double ones; arnd that there was not sufficient air in the following-up bank of one of the fallen boardgate*, to which allualon i8 made else. v, here.
Abbott was the only witness who complained about the single doors, but Mr. Sellars was of opinion that double doors should be adopted in all boardgates, in case the Pit is worked with naked lights. in future. The only double door in the pit at the time of the explosion was in the airgate leading direct from the drawing to the ventilating shaft.
Another matter of inquiry was the distance between the "slits," as affecting the ventilation, and it appeared to be considered that they were too far distant from each other. The evidence of John Long, George Bamsden, and other witnesses was that during the management of Mr. Pearce, a former underground steward, the slits were driven at distanced of 20 yards from each other; but since Mr. Coo came into office (which was four or five months before the explosion) they had been driven as much as from 40 to 45 yards from each other. On this point Warhurst (deputy) deposed that the slits, which were of the requisite height and width, were generally about 20 yards apart. Of slits running out of boardgates there was only one instance in which they were further apart than 20 yards, but on the end there were slits from 40 to 42 yards distant from each other. When in working on the level they kad gone as far as 40 yards from one slit before driving another brattice boards had been used, but they had driven slits on the end as long as 40 or 43 yards without brattices. In so doing they had used candles, never having had occasion to use safety lamps in such cases. They had not been in the habit of having more than one sht open near the face of the boardgates or
By Rule 23 brattices are required to be kept not more than 12 feet from the " face." On that point evidence to the following effect was adduced :-Wm. Lodge found, on going to work on the evening prior to the explosion, that the man on the day shift had improperly left a heap of coals in his workplace, so as to impede the air current and, having sent for deputy Warhurst, he complained that his brattice boards were 34 yards from the face. Lodge's workplace was a bank on the level. Warhurst satisfied him that there was no gas in the place, and it appred that Lodge's complaint had reference more particularly to the unhealthiness of working so far from the current of air than to any danger from gas. Lodge said Warhurst's excuse for the backwardness of the brattice was a lack of material. He (Lodge) had not previously made, nor had he heard of more than one similar complaint. Five or six other witnesses said they worked with brattices varying from 15 to 3o) yards from the face, or were working 20 to 30 yards from an air course without bratticing at all. All admitted that they were not troubled with gas, and most of them thought there was no need of any or more bratticing. as they had plenty of air. Two, however, thought differently,-namely, Pchard Coldis, who said if there had been gas in his workpace it would have exploded, as there was no current ; and Henry Holt, who thought there ought to be more bratticng, allegg that less was used in Lundhill pit than in other pits where he had worked. He knew one man who had had to stay at home a day for want of bratticing. He had seven months ago complained of the want of bratticing, and was told that it was never put up in the slits. He did not complain afterwards. There were plenty of men to put up bratticing, but a lack of material. (None of the above witnesses worked in boardgates.) John Long, who worked in a boardgate, said he had once had to complain of the brattices being six yards from the face ; but on the night before the explosion it was sufficiently near. George Rawsden, who worked in a boardgate, said he saw the gas " flush" at the candle en the 10th of February, and his brattices were then 12 yards from the face. He reported the circumstance, and extra brattices were put up before he went to work next morning. William Abbott, who worked in the fourth north boardgate, said his brattices had been at times from five to seven yards from the face, though gas was be regularly seen in his workplace.
TAe evidence of the three surviving deputies as to the bratticing was to the following effect :-Warhurst, who was examined at great length upon the point, denied telling Lodge that there was a Lack of bratticing materials, and said there was no such lack at that time, though he said that there had on one or two occasions been a temporary deficiency of bratticiug, fron its nothavingbeen suppliedpurluant to order. He aamitted, however, that the rule which requires that the bratticing should not be more than 12 feet from the facings had not been complied with in all in.- stances. Mr. Coe, the underground steward, had very particularly required that in boardgates the rule should be strictly complied with, and on the night preceding the explosion there were no brattices in boacdgates so distant from the facings as 12 feet. But in levels, ends, and slits, himself and the other deputies had not considered it necessary to comply with Rule 23, and levels and slits had been driven as far as 42 or 43 yards without bratticing, though on the night preceding the explosion he did not think the brattioing was anywhere else so far behind as in Lodge's place, where it was from 20 to 30 yards from the face. The reason for not keeping the bratticing so near the face in slits, ends, and levels as in boardgates was, that though the coal " made" (emitted) considerable gas in boardgates which are worked to the rise, it made scarcely any on the end or level, nor ever had, and he had never seen any gas in levels, slits, or ends. Warhurst added that it was customary in all the pits in the locality to depart from Rule 23 in working on the end; that no miner but Lodge had ever complained to him of the distance of the bratticing, but many had complained that in consequence of the nearness to which it was carried to the face the current of air was so strong as to waste their candles. Sometimes when he had gone to put up bratticing, pursuant to Mr. Coe's orders, Itbe miners had sworn that they would not continue work if it was done, and on some occasions he had been obliged to listen to their remonstrances, finding that if the bratticing was put up tl,e current of air would be so strong that they would not be able to keep their candles lighted, even though they had wooden shades to protect the light. To the question, " Bas Mr. Coo sanctioned the breach of Rule 23 with regard to brattices on the end?" Warhurst replied,-"I am not aware that he has been strict with us about brattices in the silts or levels." Corbridge also admitted that the brattices in the slits and levels had not been kept within 12 feet of the facings, adding that it had not been thought necessary, and that nobody had ever complained of the bratticing being too distant, while plenty had complained of the ourrent being too strong. The deputies had no particular orders from Mr. Coe about brattices in those parts. It was elicited from John Thompson that the boys stationed at the " trap-doors " to open and shut them were in the habit of going to the furnace when operations were suspended for dinner in the day shift and supper in the night shift, and remaining there from half to three-quarters of an hour. Corbridge admitted that this had been permitted by himself and the other deputies, but said no corves passed through the doors during the absence of the "trappers." John Goodison, the furnace tenter, said he always sent the trappers from the furnace in time for them to get to their doors before the " hurriers " (the persons who push the corves in which the coals are conveyed from the workplaces to the bottom of the shaft) began to bring corves through. Thompson, however, said some of the miners at times continued working during supper hour, and that he hurried for himself, and had taken corves through the trapdoors during the absence of the boys. The danger with regard to this matter is, that if the hurriers Lad to open snd shu t the doors for themselves they would incur the risk tf leaving them open, to the obstruction of the ventilation, rather thau be at the trouble of leaving their corves to shut them. Corbridge statedhe had no knowledge thatThompson or anybody else had taken corves through the doors during the absence of the trappers.
While the testimony to the excellent character of the general ventilation was almost universal, there was evidence of inefficiency in particular parts from exceptional causes.
Thus W. Habershaw said that about three months before the explosion the principal airway between the third and fourth boardgates on the north side fell in for a distance of 20 to 30 yards, to such an extent that topass up it a man would have to go on his hands and knees. The sectional area of the fallen Dart of the airway was thus reduced to much less than 30 leet(thearearequired byone of the rules)
He worked in the bank which this fallen 1irway was iniended to ventilate for six weeks after the fall, and the
oustruction was not then remedied,-a " following-up" airway which was commenced for the purpose of replacing it faling in also. Both in the bank and goaf which the fallen airwvay was intended to ventilate there would be danger of gas actumualating, not half the due quantity of air being carried into them after the fall. John Dunstan, 'who had worked in the bank of the obstructed airway up to the Tuesday night before the explosion, said, after the first six weeks the airway became entirely stopped up, and that in consequence the only air which went to his bank was wbat passed throuph the fallen stones, and that was very little-scarcely suacient to wave a candle. When last there (a day and a-half before the explosion) he did not, however, notice any gas in the bank. Beevers deputy) believed the fallen airway was never entirely closed, hut it did not come under his inspection. Corbridge (deputy) said the fal had been gradual, and no part of it, except that replaced by a following-up bank, occurred so l0ng as three maonths before the explosion. He admitted tias during the fortnight preceding the explosion the next airway nearer the shaft, between the same two boardgates. had also been gradually faling in and a f"foluowing-up"1
bank was ben su driven to replace that also, but wasc not. completed. (hs answers to questious conveyed the inmpression that, in his opinion, due effort had been made, though without succs, to rplace the two fallen airwaysw
He last examined Dunstan's bank end the "cgoaf"e of the other obstructed airway three dayb before the explosion, and found them quite free from gas. In Dpustahes bank there was net a suffcient urreoit of air to blow a candle out, but quite sufficient to waste it.
Illngworth (the deputty) examined the north side of ith pit on the moming of the explosion, and the preslumption is that he examined the parts which the fallen airways were intended to ventilate, and also that he found them free from gs as he reported to Corbridge after the examiination that all as right, but., Illingworth having perished by the explosion, this cannot be positively ascertained.
Warhurst, however, spoke generally to e-xamining every. part of the pit during the night before the explosion with-
o0t finding a single place, either in the old or new woridngs, il which the gas would fire a, his lamp. The deputies satributed the falls to the extreme t'enderness of the roof, and said they could not be helped, and that, with these two exceptions the rest of the airways were in a satisfactory state. Abraham Levitt, a packer, who gave evidence unfavourable to the managemnent in other respects, said
he visited the anks of one impeded airway on the mornin7 f the explosion, and at other times, and considered t safe to work in them with naked lights, there being air enough to turn a cacdle. He also testified, with regard to the length of time the airways liad heen obstructed, that making a following up bank was the most expeditiou3 mode of remedying such an obstruction.
As connected with the falling of the roof, we may now advert to the "packingo-namely, the building of walls to support the roof a the coal is won.
Willsm Habberhaw stated that about two months before the explosion, and while he was working in the following-up bank whichthefallen airway was intended to ventlate, he complained to the assistnt underground steward and to Warhuist of the want of packing, the packwalls being 20 yards from the face of the bank, and that they toldlhim thero were many "worse off" than he in that respect. He considered that it was not safe for the packng to be more than from four to six yards behind. tWitnesg admitted that on his complaint the packing was carried: 10 yards nearer the face, and that he understood (for he was not then working in the same place). that at the time of the explosion the bank in question was packed to within the proper distance of the face. He, however, made a general complaint that, in consequence of the underground steward reducing the wages of t e packers a shiUing a day, all the skilled men with the exception of four or five had left, and labourers and navvies who were ignorant of pits had been employed in their places;and that, in consequence, the packing generalyhad got behind. He further alleged that the packers were allowed to work with common oil lamps, or with safety Ilamps from which (the lamps not being looked according to Rule 1) they took the gauze, in which the safety consists; and, while ad. miting that they might safely work with unprotected lamps in some parts of the pit, said it was not safe for them to use such lamps in the old workings (which they had done), because in case of a sudden exudation of gas the unskille& packers would not know how to extinguish their common jamps or put the gauze on their Davy lamps. He had secn Warhurst and the assistant underground steward visit the packers when working with naked lights. In reply tot he above statement, Cozbridge (one of the deputies) said that the packers worked in couples, one building and the other carrying him stone, like a masons labourer; and that all those who built were experincced men. He admitted that the stone got from the roof and used for packing was inferior material for the purpose, and that the roof was so extremely tender that it had faUen in place, though props had been sed in addition to the packing. He had reprimanded the packers for taking the gauzes off their safety lamps, but had not taken the precaution to give them locked lamps, although Rule 1 re quired that safety lamps should not be given out "without being previously locked," and the packers were required to use safety lamps. Two packers were at work in one of the fallen boardgates on the day of the explosion, and had perished. Abraham Levitt (the only surviving packer) con-
med the statements that the wages of the packers had been reduced, and that men ignorant of pits had been employed in the place of skilled packers, but, on being closely examined, admitted that all the men employed as pckers, with but one exception, were practical colliers. Be also. admitted that the previous underground steward had permitted the packers to use common oil-lamps, but that Mr. Coe, the ppresent steward, had required them to have safety lamps. On the day preceding the explosion, and at other times, he had worked with a candle, as well as a Davy lamp, because thelamp-oil was bad. In doing so he was acting contrary to the orders of 31r. Coe, but Mr. Coe's son and the deputies had seen him do this and not reprimanded him. He had complained of the badness of the oil in the presence of all the remen. When the packers had only safety lamps they took off the gauze, though they knew they broke Rule 20 in so doing. Witness could not say that the reduction of wages caused the packing to get 20 yards behind, and admitted that when it was behind the roof was supported by wooden props. He also said that, so far as he knew, all the packing was well up at the time of the explosion, and that the pack-walls were firmly built. George Hartley, lamp cleaner, said he had had no complaints of the badness of te ooiL Warhurst, whose duty it was to provide oil, however, admitted that there had been complaints of its inforiority a fortnight before the explosion, and at other times. By way of accounting for the laxity of himself and the other deputies, he said the pit was so safe that, although the packers were required to use Davy lamps, it was considered a mere form. The packers had not latterly been allowed to take any lights except Davy lamps, which he admitted were not locked. He never saw the packers have the gauzes off their lamps when in the goaves or old workings, but he had seen them have them off in the airway close to the old workings. The state of the goaves is a question of considerable imn portance, inasmuch as several of the miners have expressed an opinion that the explosion arose from a faU of roof forcing into the working parts of the pit a quantity of inflammable gas which had accumulated in the goaves from a want of efficient ventilation. Warhurst, who, as before stated, was a deputy on the night shift, aUeged that he " carefuly examined the goaves on the evening before the explosion. They were quite clear of gas." Similar evidence is given with regard to p art of the goaves by Beevers, the other deputy on the night shift. Corbridge said he examined the goaves on the south and west sides of the pit before the men went to work on the morning of the explosion, and it is presumed that Illingworth, who is among the Iaed, examined those in the other parts at the same time. Corbridge found those he examined free from gas so far as he could get into them, and received a report from Illingworth in general terms that all was safe on the other side of the pit. Themanagementwith regardto the goaves was, however, not considered by all to have been quite satisfactory. In the goaves, the roof being tender fals freely, but it does not fall " doss up," and this being the case it is alleged that air should have been introduced to ventilate the unfallen parts by means of holes through the pack walls at short distances-a plan which was not adopted. On this point Mr. B. Sellars, in reply to a question with regard to working the pit with naked lights in future, said,-"I think if certain holes were left in the 1ack walls, so that part of the air could circulate through the goaves, the gas could not accu. mulate so as to burst through and igite at the candles. But
do notthink it possible to ventilate th goaves with the naterislsat present used for building the ack waUs (namely, stnen from the roof of the workings). The necessary apertures could only be made by building the pack walls of better stone, or other materlal to betaken into the pit for the purpose." George Blackburn and Henry Holt, miners, also considered it essential to the safe working of the pit that the goaves should be ventilated, as indicated above. The former stated that on two occasions when fals had taken place In the goaves he has heard rumbling noises, caused, as he supposed, by the motion of gas liberated by the falL Holt sa d there must have been accumulations of gas in the goa-es, because there was no ventilation to force it out. Both are of opinion that the explosion arose from gas being forcea out of the goaves by a fall of roof. Other miners made similar statemeuts, with the addition that the gas had very likely accumulated in parts of the goaves inaccessible to the deputies. To this it should be added that none of the few survivors speak to hearing any faUs on the morning of the explosion, and that some of the miners said falls of roof had not generaUy been followed by exudations of gas.
One of the most important questions raised in the inquiry was the propriety or impropriety of working the pit with naked lights, and on aU matters bearing upon this question the Government inspector made mostminute inquiries. The rule on this point requires that, " The underviewer or his deputy must see that safety-lamps are used, and candles excluded whensoever and wheresoever danger from firedamp is apprehended," but does not absolutely require that the pit shall be worked with safety-lamps. Warhurst and Corbridge both state that they ordered safety. lamps to be used by the miners whenever and wherever it was necessary to use them. The witnesses generally did not complain of any laxity in this respect, and one of them said he had been ordered to use safety-lamps onall necessar
occasions. But from the evidence of Burrows it appeared that rule 18, which reqcuires that when a miner receives orders from the underviewer;or deputy to use a safety-lamp he shall continue to do so until he receives counter-orders, bad not been complied with. When the deputies had orderedhim to use a lamp, they told him to use it " until the gas was worked out of. his place," and left him to the exercise of his own discretion about returning to the use of a candle, seldom revisiting his work-place to see whether the gas had been carried away. He, however, he said, was careful not to use candles again until it was safe to do so. WVe have it on the evidence of Warhurst (confirmed by Corbridge) that on the day of the explosion there was not a single Davy lamp in use by the miners in any part of the pit; that theyo ad never been required to be used except sometimes in the boardgates, when there were "feeders" or "blowers" of gas, whch had but seldom occurred, and were of a very " triRin" coharacter. r Feeders" or "blowers" are streams of gas whiich occasionally issue from fissures in the coal, antd when there is no accumulation of gas in the surrounding atmosphere they will, on a light being applied, blare like the gas from a jet. It is considered dangerous to light them.,
annain the absence of due ventilation they, if no` lighte-t
soon, cause such an accumulation of gas as would lead to an explosion.] Bearin,gupon the question of whether safety. lamps were always ordered to be used "whensoever and wheresoever danger was apprehended from gas"' is the following evidence as to the circumstances under which they were note used:
Joseph Swift said he had sometimes seen a little gas in his workplace in the first north boardgate. He did not work with lamps at the time, but had brattice boards not more than two yards from the face.
John Thompson and others had seen "blowers" lighted by candles and blaze, but the ventilation was so efficient that the surrounding atmosphere did not contain gas enough to explode. He had continued to work with candles in such cases. John Dunstan, who worked in the bank of one of the obstruoted airways, in which there was scarcely air enough to wave a candle, said he was never told to use safety-lamps, and continued to use candles. Thomas Dallison, who worked in the bank of the other fallen board. gate, said he had used a candle since as before the fall, The air in the hank, though diminished in quantity, was in a decent state, and he had never seen ny gas, except about 7 o'clock on the evening before the explosion, and then only ust as much as the candle would "fldush" at. In reply to questions this wvitnes added that he had put his candle somewhat out of the eurrent to prevent it from wasting when the gas " flushed " at it, and that immediately- on ob. Berving the gas he moved it. He did not considertherewas any danger in Using candles in this bank, not even when 'the gas fiushed at it. John Long said he had seen blowers of 'gs in his boardgate, and that on thcse occasions thedeputies . gave him safety-lamps "when it was necessarytousethem."
-Levittm the packer, said he had seen "blowers," though not frequcutfy, an two or three different parts o the pit. The miners in thoseplaces were using candles at the time. his witness thought it safe to work the pit generally with -candles. G.Ramsdensaidhehadseveraltimesseen gas in the 'So. 1 north boardgate, where he work-ed, the last time being uwards of a week prior to the explosion. -He reported 1
circumnstance to Deputy Illingsworth. The bratticing wali 12 yards from the face at the time, but additional bratticing
'was put up the same evening. He -was not ordered to use a safety-lamp when he saw the gas, and did not do so. Wit. ness also said that on one occasion the gas flushed at his candle, but it was when, contrary to rule 1Z, he had placed his candle behind a prop. He was not on this occa. sion ordered to use a Davy lamp. Corbridge (the deputy) ndmitted that a week before the explosion he sawv a blower on the north side of the pit blazing. It was but a slight blower, and he ordered it to be at onee put out. He did not thereupon order Davy lamps to be used in that nart of the pit. He had seen scores of such blowers in his time. To thistheGovernmentinspectorrejoined, "AndI have seen hundreds of such acts of imprudence."
The above evidence bears more especially upon the question whether, on the assumption it was proper to work the pit with candles generallv, Davy lamps have been used in all cases where special circumstances requiredtheiruse. One of the miners (Henry Holt), however, was of opinion that candles ought not to be used at all in the v orking of the Barcsley seam of coal, and by implication that they ought not to be used in the Lundhill pit. Bearing upon this question is the fact frequently admitted in evidence, that the Sarnsley seam as worked at Lundhill is a fiery one, and also the following evidence .
Samuel Abbott, who worked on the fourth north broadgate, said gas might be constantly seen ; the straight boardgates made (emitted) it regularly. He could hear itexud. ing constantly. Peter Luadrick also stated that durin the last month there had been frequent blowers of gas. There is also the fact that the roof is an extremely tender one ; so much so that it is said to have been impossible to prev'ent the falls in the two airways which have been alluded to aS obstructed,; and fals of roof are likely to cause sudden exidations o gas.
lMr. Selers, mineral agent, who had examined the pit, said, the ventilation of the " following-up" banks was not so good as he could have wished, though he did not apprehend danger from the state of them, and from what he learnt of the roof he did not think it was possible to maintain the air-courses and following up banks in a better state than they were in. In reply to questions by the Government inspector this witness considered that the managers were justified in working the pit with nakedlights; and that in case they altered the furnace, placed double instead of single trap-doors in the boardgates, and ventilated the goaves, as mentioned elsewhere, he saw no objection to working the pit with naked lights in future. There would be great difficulty in working the pit with Davy lamps, from their liability to break and other causes. Ii farther saport of the propriety of working the pit with naked lights (princpallycandles) is the evidence of the majority of the miners examined, that the pit generally was one of the best ventilated they had ever worked in; and also the statement that, generally speaking, the falls of roof, which are msad by some of the miners to have been gradual, not lage and sudden, have not generally been attended by exudations of gas to a dangerous extent - and also the testimony of Mr. Child, mineral survevor, who examined the pit in January, that it was efficiently ventilated, well conducted, and well officered. It was, however, stated that the Oaks Coliery (where a very serious explosion occurred some years ago), and some of Earl Fitzswlliam's pits, in all of which the Barnaley seam is being won, are being worked by the use of Davy lamps, instead of candles or other naked lights.
William Lodge said that rule 17, which requires that "when a miner is using his safety-lamp he must see that his hurier does not use; a nakedlight in the same workplace," had been regularly violated. His hurrier had three or four times used a candle when he had been using a safetylamp, and he had seen others do the same.
As to the cause of the explosion, generally speaking the more experienced witnesses declined to offer a suggestion. The miners displayed less reserve, and gave their opinions on that point. Most of them attributed It to a fall of roof in the goaves, driving out an accumulation of gas, while Warhurst (the deputy) thought it had probably arisen from the leaving open of a "trap door." The men generally, including some who had lost near relatives, said they did not blame any one on account of the explosion
* The examination of Mr. Joseph Coe, the viewer, occupied upwards of five hours. His evidence will be found to tear upon most of the questions raised in the foregoing' evidence, but, as it possesses special importance, we append it in a separate form, in preference to incorporating it with the preceding evidence. Hr. Coe, examined by the coroner, said, he was appointed viewer of the Lundhill Pit in Octo. ber last, and had the entire control, management, and supervision of the underground workigs. He was in the pit on the day preceding the excosion, when he examined the ventilating currents, and found them circnlating in their usual quantities. Mr. Coe then detailed with great minuteness the particulars of an examination which be made of the whole of the workings on the north side of the pit on that day, made with unusual care, because of an intended absence for a few days. The whole of the worings, including the goaves, he found well ventilated, perfecty free from gas, properly bratticed, and in every respect in the best working order. Among other places, Mr. Coo examined the third and fourth bank gates on the north side, both of which were partly fallen in, and also the banks and gooves ventilated. by them. He found a strong current passing up both of the fallen bank gates; but part of the air whieh would have passed up them in case they had not been obstructed, was passing regulating stoppings, so that the current to thefallen bank gates was not so great as to "throttle" the air -i e. prevent the current by the too geat presure. The banks and goaves of both the fallen banklgates he found perfectly free from gas and well ventiltted, the curent in the portions of the bank gate beyond the obstruction being sufficiently strong to extinguish his candle in one instance and nearly so in the other. Men were working with naked candles at the faces of the banks of the fallen bank gates, and he considered it perfectly safe for them to do so. The only other obstructed air course was a slit between the first and second following up banks of the straight board gates, but this was not such a fall as seriously to impede the current or cause any accumulation of gas. He had intended to make a similar examination on the south side on the following day, but was prevented by the exilosion. He had examined the souLth side on the LIonday or Tuesday previous, but not so minutely. There were no falls on that side, and ke found everything in a satisfactory state. The straight board gates, in which the witness Abbott had said there were constaut blowers, he had not examined since the Friday or Saturday preceding the explosion. He did not on the last examination find any gas in the straight board gates or in the headings at the top of them. he brattices were only 10 or 12 feet from the; face of the straight board gates. He did not find any blowers of gas, but a little gas was made in the face of all the board gates; not more, however, in the face of the straight board gates than in others. The blowers referred to by Abbott were, he believed, some distance from the face, though he had never seen them. The blowers of gas at Lundhil1 were not large issues of gas, but small ones, such as he should call " feeders," such as if a light was applied would blaze like a small jet of gas or a candle. He had never seen there any blowers of gas of much magnitude, or which he considered at all dangerous, nor were there many small ones. The hissing noise spoken to was caused by the gas forcing its way through a little water. Generally speaking, the blowers were near the face of the boardgates. With regard to the complaint as to the distance of the slits, Mr. Coe said he had them driven 40 yards apart only where there was plenty of air and the roof was good. When they were only 20 yards apart, as the board gates were proceeded with every alternate one had to be made up by a stopping, and the other left open for hurrying purposes. The object of driving them 40 yards apart was to prevent having the alternate one to stop, and he did not think there was any danger in it. There were two headings north and two south from the top of the straight beard gates. Of those on the south side one was 10 and the other 20 yards long. The current being strong up the board gates naturally went into the headings to some extent, but there werenobratticing orotherprovision for carrying it into those headings. They had not deemed it necessary to put up brattices in headings of that length because the headings were driven on the level and they never found any gas IU driving on the leveL The reason there was not likely to be so much gas made in driving on the level as in driving board gates which were carried to the rise was that in driving to the rise they cut the cleaverages, or fibre, of the coal at right angles, but in driving on the level they went parallel with the cleaverages. It was the custom, however, when they drove on the level for more than 20 yards to divert the current up them by means of bratticing; and of the two headings to the north of the straight board gates there were from 2to 25 yards of brattice in the bottom one, which was from 30 to 40 yards long, and he believed a single length of brattice in the top heading, which was not so long. The length of brattice put into headings depended on cir
cumstances of which the deputieswere generally the judges; but he (Mr. Coe) gave o rs for bratticing wherever he found gas on ma;ung his examinations. There were no feeders in the headings, and naked candles were used iu them, which he considered safe. With regard to the packers, Mr. Coe said, they were all competent and, he beHoved, careful men. They worked in couples, and care had always been taken that one of each couple was no only a competent, but a reiable man. The packers as a rule used naked lights, but were required to have with them a safety-lamp for use in case they had togo into the goaves, which they were prohibited from enterig with a naked
Mr. Morton.-Then,it is not true, as statedby,Defuty Corridge, that they always workedwith unlockedsafety-
*Mr. Coesaid it was correct in the sense that they had always safety-lamps with them, but not correct in the sense that they were not allowed to work with naked lights. As to the packers taking the gauze off their lamps a little mistake might have arisen in this way. The owners provided lamps and oil; the packers bought candles for themselves, and sometimes, rather than buy candles, they had used the lamps with the gauze off, where they were at hberty to use candles, Though the pack walls had to be built close to the goaves, he sanctioned their use of candles, considering it as safe for them to use lights as the packers in the banks where the pack walls had to be built. The bebt olive oil was always su plplied for tho lamps, and he had heard no complaint of its being bad. He gave each of the miners a copy of the rules about thr eeks before the explosion, though many had had copies previously. Had been in the habit of pointing out rules to persons whom he found breaking them, The total number of men and boys employed in the pit was 288; three-fourths worked in the day and one-fourth in the night.
He did not think the number was too great considerine tha Size of the pit. The average quantity of coal got was ?rom 6500 to 600 tons in the 24 houzs.-Would not the getting of such a large quantity of coal liberate a great deal of gas ?- In a fiery pit he should object to work beth night and day hifts, but he did not think there was any danger in it at Lundhbi, so small was the quantity of gas emitted, He never saw anywhere in the pitwhich would explode at a naked canae, Never saw a paIclof gas anywhere except the small quantity given off -by lo leeders at the board gate faces, which are about 20 in jumber. B He had paid the mot particular attention to the goaves, having even, ta satisfy himself, broken tho yule by trying them with a
naked candle, and never found any gas in them whatever.
The followzing evidence was then given as to the cause of the explosion:-
The Coroner.-Are yoa enabled to state what, in your judoMr Coe,-I have thought the matter very carefuly over.
It has occupied my serious attention, and 1am utterly at A loss to amcount for it.
Air. Morton.-Although you may not be able to aecount for the explosion, have You not formed some notion on the matter ?
Mr. Coo.-I have formed a notion, but it is merely a hypotbetical one. We have a very tender roof above the coal, about six or seven yards thic!k, which falls in the goaves very freely. Abovo that is a much stronger roof, n early te n yards thick, whinch I presume will support the weight above it after the lower roof has fallen for a consi. derable distance. Immediately above that strong roof are Some seams of coal and a seam of wehat us generaUXy known as "sblack hale," from three to four feet thick. The seams of shale and coal give out gas in considerable quantities
After the bottom roof had fallen down bythe extension of the goaf, the stronger roof above may have given way and liberated the gases in the measures above. That being the case, the gas may have come out inlarge quantities and uddenly, in which case it would necessarily explode on coming in contact with the nearest naked light. I merely give this as a theory, and cannot be positive s to the fact.
Mr. Morton.-It is a very probable theory. Do you consider this the most probable cause
Mr. Coe.-I do not form a belief on the matter, but if I did that would be the cause to which I should attribute the
B^y the For man-I had never seen any fall of this deBy 3Mr. Melrton.-Had you ever observed anything to lea y2ou to the SuppOsitiOn that such a thing would shortly
Mr. Coe.-No; I only now suppose there may have been such a fall from what I saw of the diking, and from my experience at other places. Mr. Coe then gave evidence as to the exertions made to get down the pit as speedily as possible after the explosion, the efforts made to explore it, and the necessity of closing the shafts as the only means of n rof venting the pit from being irrecoverably lost, and preserving a chance of the bodies in the pit being recovered. His evdenee entirely confirmed that previously published on those points.
Cross-examined by Mr. Morton, Mr. Coe said he was responsible for the proper ventilation and management of the anderground workings, which were placed entirely under his care. He had always once, and often threo or four times a week measured the strength of the air currents according to Rule L The least quantity of air ho had found
asgt ugh one side was 25,000 cubit feet per minute. e had every day and night employed careful and steady men at the furnace, including Sundays, although the furnace was neglected from Saturday night until Mlonday before he became viewer. The lamps were not locked according to rale 1, becauise they were not in use in any particular place, but were merely taken out by the packers as a precaution. There had never been any deficiency of bratticing materials. When the explosion occurred he was baving a low level driven to aecuro the ventilation more efficiently, such level not having been made when the pit was opened. He was fully at lberty to do whatever he thought necessary for the proper working of the 'it The orginal divisions for ventilation were judicious; he had not altered them. He knew of no contracted places in the air-currents except those he had named, and there were only two other a.uRates of which the sectional area was even in a Plight degree less than required by rule. Before the explosion he thought the furnace was constructed in & safe and judicious mode, but, > gz the correctness of his theory that the explodon had been caused by a large and sudden influx of gas was correct, he thought the furnace both at LundhiUl and in all others of the Barnsley pits liable to sudden eruptions of gas should be fed with fresh air, and that the "return" air of the pit should be carried over the furnace through a " dumb drift," so that it might not come in contact with the furnace. He thought so beasuse there was danger of the return air of a gaseous niine firing at the furnace. He believed in the instance at Lundhill the gas had not fired at the furnace. He had not been able even to surmise either where thegas: entered the pit or fired. There were between 40 and 0 trapdoors in the pit, and with the exception of those between the shafts all were single ones, including those at the bottom of the boardgates. Ho did not think ventilation by measm of trapdoors an efficient mode, and at the time of the explosionwas havinga level drivento do away with them. In the absence of the level, double doors would be safer than single ones, but he found the doors gingle when he became miewer, and it was customary to have them single. Rule 24 required that doors in the prinoipal airways should be "checked or doubled." Those in th3s pit were checked, bat It was only so far as the return air was concerned, and the leaving open of any one of thom would nearly stop the ventilation of some district of the mine, and cause it to become fiery. On the present system of getting coal they could not dispense with an of tbe 40 or 50 doors in the pit, only a few of which (those at the boardgate ends) were opened and shut by "trappers," the hurriers having to open and shut the others themselves as they passed through with the corves of cdals. He had had no complaint of the leaving open of trapdoors
Under all these c nmstaroes, and keing in view his supposition with regard to the sudden ax of gas, ought not such a mine to be worked exclusively with safety lamps?-From his experience he was certainly of opinion that all mines in the Barusley district ought to be worked exclusively with safety lamps. He also thought it desirable that the viewers of the district should meet together to discuss points connected with the management
He had had very little trouble in enforcing the rules of the pit. Erom his experience in the north of En land, in Stafferdshir:, and in the Barnsley district, he had come to this conclusion, and he stated It boldly,that the mode of getting coal prevalent in the Barusley district wa the most wvretched and dangerous he knew.
It vas objected that this was not evidence, but both the coroner and the proprietors of the pit said they were desirous to give as much latitude as possible in so important an inquiry.
MIr. Coe, in reply to Mr. Stewart (one of the owners of the pit), said the furnace at Lundhill was constructed on the same principles as those in the beat colheries in the Barnsley district. He had fuU authority to make any alterations he thought necessary. He did not before the explosion think it unsafe to work with candles. Mr. Stewart ho with Mr. Simpson, had only recently become a partner had constantly urged upon him the necessity of the strictest attention to ventlation, and he had told Mr. Stewart, what he stil thought was the case, that the ventlation was perfect. He was always given to understand that no expense was to b spared which would secure the safe working of the pit; that the proprietors did not wish their money to be pt in competition with the lives of their workpeople.
r, Morton.-Allow me another question on these answers. Taking your own answers, that the ventilation was perfect, the use of candles roper, and that the furnace was constructed on the mode wXihh, I am sorry to say, is customary in the neighbourhooe of Barnsley, does not the result in this case show that nothing but the exclusion of naked lights, and the introduction of safety lampns, and the carying awray the return air without its coming into contact wvith the furnace can guard against danger from one of those sudden influxes of gas of? which yoa have made
Mr. Coe.-In my opinion, decidedly so.
Mr. Stewart.-Those measures we (the proprietors) shall carry out in our pit. We will have nothing which wFill expose to danger the lives of our wrork,eople. What we did previous to the explosion we did believing it to be the best.
In reply to further questions, Mtr. Coo said that on the recent cnange in the firm hoea relieved of the duty of mcanagement as regarded mattersonthe surface, that he might devote all his time to the undergroand management, wvhich he had done, w ithout his salary being reduced, though the salary of the person taking the surface management was equal to what he had previously received for the entire management. That, in addition, Mr. Holt, of Wakefield, colliery engineer, was appointed to superintend operations
Byt O.tMOo~n.Sinc those changes he had devoted his chief attention to underground dutecs. At such collieriesas LandhiUl there ought to be a competent resident agent to devote his whole time to underground management.
This concluded Mr. Coo's evidence. Proclamation was made, but no further evidence was tendered.
In a conversation which ensued the foreman of the jury suggested that if deputies wvere appointed under the Government Inspectors, sO that inspections of all collieries could be made ate shurt intervals-say a month-but at irregular and uncertain tmes, to prevent anybody connected with the collieries knowing of the coming of the inspector or deputy beforehand, the Government Lnspectors might be kept Informed as to wrhether the rules and regulations were compled with, and wohether or not mines were being safely worked and thus prevent many aocidenSs.
Mfr. i,!orten stated that it wrould take eight or ten days longer to empty the pit, and eight or ten days more wrould
give evidence before the jury, dt
The foreman expressed a strong desire that some measure sould be adopted to relieve the jury from the disag,reeable and dangerous task of viewing the bodies, and a conversation ensued, during which it was stated that Dr. HIolland, Sanitary Inspeotor to the Board of Hecalth, had visited the pit, and given some highly valuable suggestions with regard to the recovery and removal of the bodies, and the coroner tprombised to task the jurya liUttle as possible in viewing the bodies. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ di Tot.

The Adulteration Of Bread.
THE ADULTERATIG OF BREAD. 7
At a meeting of the Board of Works for the Hfolborn District, held the 16th of March, 1857, the foUowing report of the Medioal Officer of Health was read, and ordered to be printed for general circulation among the inhabitants of the dietrict. S. W. HOPWOOD, Clerk to the Board.
To Tim BOARD OF WORKS, HoLBoRN DisT.RIor.
Gentlemen,-Sinceo the date of my appointment I have constntly visited the markets and shops where fish, meat, vegetables, and fruit are exposed for sale, and have also directed the inspector to viitthe public streets and marketg, especially Lether-lane, on Saturday nights, where sunc thgs are sold, and, as you are aware, in several instances, foo of an improper end ha been detected and seized. My attention has also been directedto the adulteration of various articles of food sold in this district. It is manufactred articles alone that admit of adulteration, and espedally de. mand my interferenoe. The quality, good or bWa, of those provions which are sold ln their 'rav' or original condition is sufficiently Aapnt to enable the public to pro tect themselves. Adulterations may be divided into twjo classes-the one, such as mix chicory with coffet, is a commercial fraud; the other, such as colouring pickles with salts of copper, is a crime.
"It is with the latter class alone, as injurious to bealth that i health offioer is concerned. Of aU manufactured articles of diet bread is the most important, consequently it has Iclamed my earnest attention. On analyzing numerous samples of that article purchaued of different bakers in the district, I have gene rl found them more or less adulte. rated with alum; in other respeets the article has proved good and wholesome. Notwithstanding that the law (37th George II. cap. 98, sec. 21) prohibits under a penAlty the use of alum n the manufacture of bread, it is admitted, even by bakers themaelves, to be so used under the name of 'stuff' I am satisfied that this sophistication has been ractised with the most innocent intentions. The bakers eljeve the portion of alum mixed with the bread to be quite harmless; to a certain extent it is a comme:dial fraud, though it is a reat convenience in -the manufacture, and improves the quality of the bread in certain respects which the public ap. pear to value. If it be perfectly harmless I coneive we have no right whatever to interfere in the matter. However, it is my deliberate opinionthat,.although alum is not a poison yet that its use in the manufctumre of bread is injunous to health, and concurs indirectly with other things in increas.
igthe mortality especially 4of young children), the staple article of whose dietary is bread.
; "The more effectually to discenntenance this practice I will briefly detail some of the grounds whereon this opinion is founded
" The well-known medicinal effect of alum is to confSne the bowels. It is also well known that small doses of alum repeated for a considerable time will produce at frst co-w tiveness, afterwards great irregularity of the bowels-that is to say, alternations of costivenems atid looseness, and at length continued looseness with ulceration. The quantity of alum which I have generally met with in bread has been in the proportion of from half a drachn to one drachm in the 41b. loaf; so that the man who consumes half a loaf a-day swallows every 24 hours from 15 to 30 grains of alum. Now, it is found that even 12 grains per diem, taken by a healthy adult, il produce constipation. Its effects on children vould, of course, be greater than on adults;- a smaller qjuantity would suSfice to produce the dsarrhcaa and dysenterc symptoms, and they would appear sooner. Alum entes .ntochymcalcominaton iththegluten of the flour, therefore I admiCt that itsgeffects in breLd are les active and injurious thain when administered in its pure
impuity Iin the bfreqent constpation,headaches liverderanements, &c., of those who are dependent on bakers for their bread. The fatal diarhcea o ants under three years of atnmay also have arisen from, or have been aggravated by, this cause.
" As this adulteration ias bee practised for a very great leDgth of time, I cannot recommend the adoption of an harsh measures for its suppression ; I would suggest thatal bakers in the district should be cautioned gainst it. If any flagrant cm oocuws where the injury to health is clearl
made out, Ib3oa fedrit to be my duty to advise your board to take 'he neocesary proceedings to prevent its recurrence.
" Whn the bakers are duly informed of this opinion, I am in hopes that they wiU of their own accord cease to use alum inmmdng brd The bakeris $lea at present is that it is harmless, that the public ' like it,' and I'wil have it.' So that the more effectuiall to put down an adulteration
whic is julousoheLith h ulco hi part should cease to set So high a value on these qualities in a loaf which
