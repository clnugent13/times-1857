Every possible exertion was made to rescue the poor fellow by throwing out life-lines towards him, but he was unable to avail hnimself of them, and it is said that when he was taken out of the water by a grapnel, nearl,

MONEY-MABKBT and fITYINTBLUrGNCB.
Fridy Evening.
The English funds opened with considerable steadiness this morning at the firmer prices of yesterday, and the market subsequently manifested more tendency to animation than has been observable for a long time past. Ultimately, however, although the improvement had been well maintained to the official close, an announcement was received that the Bank of France have again increased their rate for the purchase of gold from 4f. to 6f. per mille, and several speculative sales took place. Consols for money were first quoted 924 to 7, whence they went to 93 to i. For the account the last official price was 93A, but after regular hours operations were entered into at*930 to i. The business of the day was rather extensive, purchases being freely made by the public.
L.oans on stock were occasionally obtainable at e~ per cent., but some few applications were made to the Bank where the accommodation was granted at 7 per cent. for 14 days. Bank Stock left off at 212 to 214; Reduced, 9l} to 92; New Three lRe 92 to~; j ndi Stock, 221 to 223; ceto i; IndIa-bonds, .10s to Ss. discount; and Exchequer-bills (Mbarch) 6s. to ~3s. discount.
In the discount market to-day there was rather less pressure, but the demand at the Bank was understood to be active.
Foreign securities in the early part of the day were firner, but the highest prices were not in aU cases supported. It was stated that accounts have been receivedco the confirrmation of a decree raising the sinking fund on the Peruvian debt from 5 to 7 per cent. unconditionally, and transactions took place in the Four-and-a-Half per Cents., for the account, at 76i. Turkish Six per Cents., for money, were negotiated at 94k and 94, and for the account at 944 and J. In the Four per Cent. Guaranteed the operations were at 103o. Venezuela was firm at 374. The general business comprised-Brazilian, 1004 and 991; the Five per Cents., New, 99i; Danish Five per Cents., 101; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., for account, 76i; Portuguese Three per Cents., 45f; Rusian Fourand-as alf per Cents., 954, 96, and 95i; Sardinian Fiveper Cents., 90o; Spanish Three per Cents, 41; the New Deferred, 244 and 25f; and Dutch Twoand-a-Half per Cents., 644.
In the foreign exchanges thins afternoon the only alteration of importance was an improvement in the rates for Austrian paper.
The corn-market was agan ratherfirm this morning.
The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a moderate business, without alteration in prices.
The inal quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 69f. 70c. for money, and 69f. 85c. for the end of the month, showing a decline of an eighth from the lower prices of last evening.
The notification regarding the augmented offer of the Bank of France for gold caused much surprise this afternoon, as it has been stated that the position of the establishment haa not experienced any adverse change. The unavoidable inference, however, is that the governors see no hope of being able at present to trust to their stock of bullion being upheld by the natural course of tho trade of the country.
Further advices from Paris mentioned that the doubling of the capital of the Bank of France, which is at present 3,760,0001., has been definitively resolved upon.
The Bank of Fvrankfort has raised its rate of discount from 4 per cent. to 5 per cent., the point at which it stood in February Last.
The specie brought by the Atrato from the West Indies is 138,0001., of which only 48,5001. is silver, and the remainder gold, which will be sent to France. The large arrival expected from Mexico by the Magdalena cannot be looked for until about the 2d of May, too late for the India ail of the 4th, the quantity required for which will therefore have to be procured from the Continent.
A further sum of about 10,0001. in Australian gold was taken to the Bank to-day.
The produce markets during the week have been influenced by the stringent rates of discount, and in some cases quotations have experienced a further slight decline. Less inquiry has existed for sugar, although the better descriptions generally support the prices which prevailed before the short recess at Easter. Four floating cargoes have been taken for the united kingdom, including one of 1,000 tons of clayed Mani, at 36s. for distant arrival, which is 6d. cheaper. The returns of this week's deliveries are looked forward to with unusual interest; 1.00,800 baskets of Java are advertised for sale by the Dutch Trading Company on the 19th proimno. In coffee the chief feature has been the public sales of plantation Ceylon of the new crop, which went readily at very high rates, particularly thegood and fine coloury sorts, these realizing a considerable rise upon the valuations. Cocoa is again lower. Very few transactions have taken place in tea, and there is en entire absence of speculation. Common congou has been sold at a slight decline, and a few parcels of green are also reported at lower rates. Of rice sales have been upon a limited scale, prices showing heaviness. The public sales of spice have gone off without material variation. The market for rum is extremely firm, with few parcels offering for sale. Saltpetre, after a further decline of 6d. to ls., closes to-day much firmer, and fine Bengal on the spot is worth 41s. 6d. to 42s. For arrival several hundred tons have changed hands, present value 40s. to 40s. 6d. per cwt.
The following balance-sheet in the bankruptcy of Messrs. Fox and Henderson was filed yesterday, showing a nominal surplus of 35,2431. These figures seem unexpectedly favourable, but it is nevertheless affirmed that the valuation of the assets has been made with care, and that a very satisfactory final result may be hoped :-

A fresh representation on the claims of the holders of the confiscated Spanish coupons has just been addressed to the President of the Council at Madrid by the Chairman of the Bondholders Committee.
The next sales of colonial wool are fixed to commence on Thursday, the 30th inst. According to a circular of Mr. W. H. Willnan the arrivals since the lat sales have been about 55,265 bales,
At the Court of Bankruptcy to-day a further dividend of 2s. 6d. in the pound was declared under the estate of the Royal British Bank. This, with the Us. 6d. already paid, will make a total of 8a., and it is fully expected that a third dividend of 2s. can be realized in the course of two or three months. More than half of the creditors having consented to accept the proposed payment by the shareholders of Os. 6d. in the pound, this arrangement, if adopted, will raise the total to 16s. 6d. It is also thought that the Welsh works may be turned to greater advantage than was at first anticipated, and that consequently there is the possibility of an amount of 18s. 6d. in the pound being eventually secured.
Thereturn from the Bank of England for the week ending the 11th of April gives the following results when compared with the previous week -

and prices in some cases have exhibited a further advance. Foreign and colonial have been steady, the transactions having been limited. Indian de. wcriptions were in greater demand, and the small Eshares, inclulding those of the Panjaub and Eastern Bengal lines, were purchased at an advance. After the usual hours there was a slight reaction in all cases, and quotations were then rather lower. IAttle alteration occurred in banking, rinig, and miscellaneons securities, the operations having been unimportant. Punjaub left off 2 to i pm.; and Riga B to; pm.

LONDON, SATUDAY. APRIL 18, 1857.
Among the passions which belong to human nature we may recognize what may be called a passion ior size. Those primitive works of fiction whlich feed the childish imagination appeal very hold]y to this passion. They go straight to the point, and create without ceremony men, houses, and lions ten times bigger than actual men, real houses, and live lions. But this is not the only quarter in which this appeal is mad". Science, with all its gravity, copies fiction here, and appeals to the same passion exactly as the childish fairy tale did. lVhat single ingredient in astronomy, for example, tells more in creating a taste for that science than the enormous distances in which it abounds? The figures which represent the distances of heavenly bodies from us, or the speed with which light, or the speed with wh)ich electricity travels, have the same fascination for the scientific that the numbers in the banker's book have for the covetous imagination. The one set of figures constitutes the conventional symbol for space, and the other for wealth.
Whoever wants to feed this natural passion for size in the primitive way, and to see a true giant in its own line, must viBit the bank of the Thames st Millwall. But before he goes we recommend him, unless he is very well versed in the Book of Genesis, to turn to the 6th chapter, and refresh his memory as to the dimensions of NoAu's Ark and the " fashionY of its making: " The length " of the Ark shall be 300 cubits, the breadth of it
60 cubits, and the height of it 30 cubits." So, reckoning the cubits at a foot and a half, we have a ship 450 feet long, 75 feet broad, and45 feet high. Wbile the visitor is collecting data as to ships, sacred and profane, he may turn out " Marlborough" in the Navy List, and there he will see that the largest line-of-battle ship in the British Navy is exactly of 4,000 tons burden. And now let him get on board a Greenwich steamer and be steamed through the picturesque Pool to Miliwall. Just opposite Deptford he will be aware of something pre-Adamitic wallowing in the mud of the Isle of Dcgs-a stranded saurisn ship, to which even NOAH'S Ark must yield iprecedence, and to which all the Marlboroughs, and Wellingtons, and Merrimacs, and Niagaras in the world are mere cockboats. An iron hull of the burden of 23,000 tons, nearly 700 feet long, and 60 high, will meet his eye-the hull of Mr. SCOTo RUSSELL'S Great Eastern steamship. We must give a few more figures, for every figure is a monster, and worth
looking at separately. One is a figure of 30,00), *-tle nLumber of the iron plates which compose the !enormous erection, each wreighing the third of a ton, and each fastened by 100 rivets. The ship will accommodate 4,000 passengers, 800 of whom are first-class. On sm emergency she could arry 10,000 troops. She will contain 10 boilers, and 100 furnaces. The cylinder of every engine will be six feet in diameter, and will weigh five tines as much as the great bell of St. Paul's. The screw propeller wil be 24 feet in diameter, and the diameter of the paddlewheels will be 56 feet, or considerably larger than the circus atAstley's. The principal suite of saloons will be 400 feet in length, and a promenade round the deck will afford a walk of more than a quarter of a mile. This monster ship will combine steam power in both shapes, screw and paddle, with sailing power. She will carry 11,000 tons of coal, she will be lighted by gas made on board, and the electric light wil flicker like St. Elmo'g fire at night from her masthead. She will spread 6,500 yards of canvass, and her speed is computed at 15 knots or 18 miles an hour-a rate which will perform the voyage to India by the Cape, and to Australia, in little more than a month. Who would not wish to be the captain of this gallant ship?
With these principal figures, then, gone through, let us inmagine the Great Eastern afloat, and on her road to Bombayor Melbourne, andwith her ordinary complement of passengers on board. The first idea which strikes us is the multitude of faces on board. It will, in fact, be a whole town afloat, and much more than a town of 4,000 population, because it wiU be a floating town of 4,000 grown-up persons; at least, with comparatively few exceptions, each of them being what is called an " individual," .-by which we mean a human being of size to command notice, and having to appearance, at least, a mind and will of his own, together with a formed air, tone, and manner peculiar to himself. In this sense even yon mladies are individuals. All this crowd of individualities will be collected within the dimensions of 700 feet by 60. What a new shape of human society! Take the 800 first-class passengers by themselves, and what room does even this number afford for the formation of all kinds of different circles and sets, which will know nothing of each other, one man only just knowing another by sight, and hardly that I How many immeasurable social chasms will be collected within a few hundred feet ! How many Mr. SurTns will there be who will not speak to Mr. Joas during the whole voyage because he is not in the same set ! How many Mr. JoNEsES will pay back MIr. SxriE in the same coin! Between how many " nice" young ladies and " proper" young gentlemen wiUl there not be a great gulf fixed, because in the eyes of anxious mothers the said young gentlemen are not desirable persons, but mere penniless bipeds I What flirtations wil there not be behind boats, what rivalries, and, if many Americans voyage by the Great Eastern, what duellings may we not expect on that ample deck ! In short, what an epitome or camera-obscura of the world will the Great Eastern present ! It will be worth any aspiring novelist's while to take his berth to Australia or India and back again, simply for the great convenience of having so much human nature brought before him within so small a compass. It will be the mountain brought to MAo:NrFT, the world condensing itself before his eyes, for the sake of being observed and examined. The rapid succession of faces will bewilder him at first, but individuality will come out in time, though he must be sharp about his work, otherwise the Great Eastern will have stopped her screw and paddles before he has got any results. If his material is enlarged, his time is much curtailed on the new system, Farewell to long voyages, with their appropnate quarrels and matche--their lovemakings, jiltings, reconciliations, and irrevocable unions ;-voyage life has entered on anotlher phase. For what is a month ?-it is gone before we begin to think about its going. How will the old voyagers look back to the romantic days when a roomfull of persons were their own company for four months, gradually forming enmities or friendships, when attachments rose up among " young people" unconsciously and by the mere passive influence of the scene ! We are growing a busier nation every year, and cannot afford time for more than one chapter of this sea romance.
But we must not let the appeal to imagination supersede the real practical result of the grand experiment of the Great Eastern. The poet, as he surveyed this vast sublunary scene of restless industry and adventure, was struck by nothing so much as the triumph of man over the sea. He expresses himself as more than struck,-as sAocked.
"Nequicquiam Deus absldait
" Prudens Oceano dissociabili "Terras, si tamen impic
" Non tangeada r&tes transiUunt vzda."
He a?gued that the sea was a providential appointment, and that it was impious in man to struggle against it,-he had no right to unite what GOD had separated, and connect land with land when the Divine power had inserted water between. We have long seen the weakness of this argument, and arrived at a much better doctrine of final causes than this. But, if any one wants to see a good finishing blow given to the Horatian argumentat least on the Solvitur ambulando principle-he may see it given by the Great Eastern. That mighty fabric indeed does not talk, but it acts,-its act being a month's voyage to India or toAustralia. That act, while it is a speechless, is at the same time the most powerful answer, that the religious scruples of the awestruck poet could receive. A reflecting mind will see in such a voyage a much more natural, proper, wise, and obedient fulfilment of the designs of PROVIDMIwCE than anytimid self-confinementand servile deference to a barrier of nature would have been. It will appear that the sea was made to alternate with the dry land, not that continents might be disconnected, but that man should have the opportunity of exerting his skill and invention in connecting them. The result of this great experiment in ship. building, if it answers, of which there is little or no doubt, will bo a consolidation of the British
Eimpire such as we have not yet seen. Half of the space which separates the various sections of it from the mother countiy and from each other will be annihilated. Our colonies will be brought comparatively close to us, and, Yhat is almost of as much lmportance as the actual vicinity gained, they will be more than twice as near to us in imagination. The difference between a month'ts voyage and two or three months is all the difference to the imagination. We think of a place as within reach, and within a bome distance, if it is only " a " mornth off." The whole Empire is thus brought into a honme compass, and obtains the addition of strength which so much greater union gives. We shalU find ourselves paying visits to and receiving visits from India and Australia. Our friends will come over for the summer with return tickets, and the British Empire will become, in virtual compass, a province.
The Neuchâtel Conferences threaten to become
The NeuchAtel Conferences threaten to become the Poland of Europe. Everybody knows on which side right and justice lie, but the cause is not one of sufficient importance to enlist the sympathies or secure the active co-operation of the human race. The King of Ptussu., it appears, is holding out on the money question. He wishes to strike a good bargain with the inevitable. AUl that was said.
upon recent occasions of the point of honour and the nice susceptibilities of the dwellere in Potadam may be reckoned as so much Vapour, or as the mere flight of winged words. The King of PRuSsIA is a prudent man in his generation,--he loves honour well, but thalers and groschen even more. There is balm in the chink of the precious metalsGilead is that bank on which we can draw at sight with the certainty of honoured checka. Why, after all, quarrel with the Prassian SovxRBGN for such a conclusion to his highflown assertions of the dignity of his Crown ? A 'good round sum will conclude the Nouchatl question; and this, after all, is not the worst result at which the Parisian diplomatists could have arrived. We shall know at least what we are about, and what is the pretext upon which the peace of Europe is to be troubled by Prussia, if trouble there is to be. "Make it guineas t" and the dogs of war will be coupled up, and the Prussian Bxr.ow. will quench her hissing torch in the muddy Spree. The King of PUSSIA, -we say again, is a very prudent man. In smaU things, as in great, his circumspection and provident forethought are conspicuous. When the great nations of Europe had met in battle array on the grim shores of Crimean Tartary, and the treasures of the world were cast forth like sand, and the blood of Europe's bravest and best was shed like water in that great contest which turned the course of history, the cautious Monarch stood aloof, and made his game. Let the world wag as it might, let the future of Europe be European or Muscovite, that signified but little to the politicians of Berlin, and to the carriers who were to make their fortunes by neutralizing the Baltic blockade. This was a great coup. The prudent SovxRBiGN, however, who conceived it and carried it out is not unlike that celebrated elephant who could with his trunk lift a cannon or pick up a needle with equal facility. Small gains are not to be despised, and, in the absence of any greater operation, the little Neuchitel affair might certainly be looked upon as a godsend. But first it was necessary to raise the price of the article in the market. iNeuchAtel must be considered as the symbol of European peace. In this case tho nations of Europe would be disposed to look favourably upon the question of pecuniary compensation. When so great a blessing could be secured for a certain price in money we should not be careful to higgle about price, nor to tolerate any hesitation in the Swiss people upon settling-day. Arms and armaments were thrust in the foreground. Arrangements for the transit of troops through the territories of reluctant populations were negotiated with various petty Courts, with whom dynastic influences and family ties weighed far heavier in the scale than their own dignity and independence. It was loudly proclaimed by the K W's agents, and never denied by himself, that when once the political prisoners were liberated every other point would be smoothed down. The only question was one of the susceptibilities of pedigree and the dignity of a Crown.
Well, the prisoners were liberated, under the auspices, if not on the direct admonition, of the powerful Court of the Tuileries, and the parties to the Neuchatel dispute were summoned before a Tribunal of Hlonour. Alas for the misnomer ! it was found practically that the point of honour was far from being the real point at issue, and that a Tribunal of Commerce would have far more speedily terminated the dispute between the litigant parties. The question at issue was not one of honourable punctilio, but of monetary interest. The King of PRUSSiA, it appears, is holding out for a larger price than the Swis are wiling to give for the total emancipation of the Canton of Neuchatel from the traditionary thrall of Prussia's KIG. We cannot wonder at the spirit of chapmanship which the Swiss have displayed in the course of the negotiation. In the first place, the Swiss are chapmen born, ready to deal with the first comer for the blood of their children or the milk of their cows. They are, moreover, fully justified in saying that the ware which the Prussian negotiator offers for sale is but a soap-bubble at best, and should not command a higher price than the ordinary market value of goods of that description. What is it the King of PRuSSIA is giving up ? What consideration is he offering for the money payment which his emissaries are now demanding in his behalf 1 The value of a nominal sovereignty over a Principality in a distant part of Europe is, of course, infinitely small to the present King of PRuSSIA or to any future Sovereign of the House of BRADND BURG, although to the Swiss it is an object of considerable importance to rid themselves of a claim which can ever be used by factions at home to disturb the tranquillity of the Cantons. There is another reason which just for the moment renders them more unwilling to loosen their pursstrings. Their negotiator, Dr. Kuax, who seems to be a gentleman of a very sanguine temperament, had possessed them with the notion that the dispute would be terminated without any cash payment if they could but make up their minds to yield the point of the liberation of the prisoners. They are naturally disgusted with a blunder which procures them so disagreeable a surprise.
At the present moment, if we may judge from advices which we have recently received from Paris, the negotiation, as far as the Swiss aud Prussian Plenipotentiaries are concerned, is at a standstill. Each has reached the limits of his instructions, and they cannot agree. M. DE HATZFELDT had made certain demands from which he would not recede, and Dr. KEEs certain offers which he would not enlarge. 1Tnder these circumstances, the other representatives, having excluded the two dissident Plenipotentiaries from their deliberations, have, it is said, settled among themselves the draught of a convention which they will force upon the acceptance of the Swiss and Prussian diplomatists. We know not how far compulsion is possible in such a case, but at least one would fain hope that if the refusal should come from the side of Prussia, the great Powers
would entirely withdaw from every guarantee, or implied guarantee, which they have ever given to Prussia concerning the relations of her SOVFREI(ou to the Principality of Neuchatel, and for the future leave the head of the House of BRA-WDP.NBURG to assert his claims to that shadowy supremacy in his own way. On the chances of any rejection by the Swiss of any conclusion to the difficulty which may be suggested by the active and fiiendly interference of the great Powers we need not enlarge. If they are so injudicious as to neglect such an opportunity of getting out of this difficulty, the best thing we can do for the future Is to leave them to themselves and the King of PRuSSIA.
The first serious effort for the advancement of
The first serious effort for the advancement of mnilitary education is involved in the General Order which we published yesterday. The deficiencies of the service as it stands at present are now so universally acknowledged that we need recall nothing which may provoke an irritating controversy. It is sufficielnt to say that the Government has felt it a duty to take measures for the instruction of those who are to be intrusted with the most responsible situations in future campaigns. A great deal hsw heen said respecting Staff appointments, and in no paticular have the
forethought of foreign countries and the neglect of our own been so much dwelt upon. The great military monrchies to which a knowledge of the art of war is a, condition of existence have all paid, within the hat 40 years, unremitting attention to the education of the offlicers who are to superintend the choice and disposition of camps, the discipline of the army, and the conveyance of order France, Prusia, Austria, and Russia have Vied with each other in the quality of their schools, and as far as we can learn from the late war the labour was not thrown away, the culture produced its fruit in season. Ourallies andourenemy were all able to keep on foot large armies with more success than we maintained our smaU one; without any display of splendid ability on
either side there was a large amount of mili- I tary knowledge constantly present, and applied at each conjuncture. Our own deficiency in such acquired skiU was, without doubt, the cause of the reverses on which so much has been said and written. So deep has been the national feeling on this subject that no Government could dare any longer to neglect reform. We have had, indeed, several times in our history similar outcries, followed by torpor as soon as the danger was past. No reform of our system followed tho American war, and even the improvements introduced during the Peninsular campaigns were suffered to fall into ruin under the pressure of aristocratic interests, aided by the lethargy of a long peace. But now public opinion has the power and the opportunity to cause its demands to be complied with. The popular anger, though sleeping, is not dead, and it so happens that there are no great questions before the country which can take away its attention from the subject of mniitary reform.
At the suggestion of the Government, therefore, the Duke of CA.RniDGE has isued this General Order respecting the acquirements which wil be con..idered necessary before appointment to places on the Staff. One of the distinctions most frequently urged, lately, by General officers, who could not deny the nepotism and favour which distinguished their appointments, has been that the personal Staff of a General requires no military qualities, and that, one man being as good as another, a Commander of the Forces or a General of Division might legitimately choose his Aides-de-Camp among his sons and sonis-in-law, his nephews, and his cousins. Hlow little the Government and the Horse Guards are inclined, on mature reflection, and after due examination of foreign Fystems, to acquiesce in this notion may be learnt from the first paragraphs of the Order, which relate to Aides-de-Camp. To prevent for the future deficiencies which we must suppose to have been observed, the Aide-de-Camp will be required to write a distinct and legible hand and compose English correctly, to have a good colloquial knowledge of one foreign language, to be able to sketch country, to know the use of the pocket sextant, to have a thorough knowledge of regimental duty and tactics and field move-
ments on an extended scale, to understand field] fortification, both as regards construction and correct description on reconnaissance. It will hardly be doubted that these acquirements are about the least with which an officer filling the responsible position of Aide-de-Camp ought to be furnished. To give orders verbally, to enter into explanations, to answer questions, to take back to the Commander the result of an interview or a reconnaissance, certainly require some little strategic knowledge, and we cannot but think that the country may require from all whom it employs so necessary an acquaintance with the elements of the military art.
Deputy-Assistant-Adjutants-General and Deputy-sistant-Quartermasters-GeneraI will be required to have a knowledge of sketching and plotting, trigonometry, geometry, and logarithms; to write, read, and speak at least one foreign language; to judge of ground and its proper occupation by all arms; to have a perfect knowledge of castrametation and the principles of permanent fortification; to be thoroughly acquainted withi geography and military history, especially as relates to the campaigns of anclent and modern Commanders. Assistant-Adjutant and Assistant-Quartermasterg General will have, in addition to the foregoing, to show an acquaintance with the elements of mechanics, hydrostatics, and geology; the construction of military bridges, dams, &c. ; the principles of strategy, and statistics of the army.
Such are the acquirements deemed necessary for an appointment on the Staff. They are certainly of no great magnitude, and when we consider what sort of things pass examinations are, and how much easiness of temper in the examiners, and a wish not to injure a young man's prospects, lead to the aoceptance of any answers which are not manifestly indicative of gross ignorance, we may well imagine that the _-plrants to Staff appointments will have no difficulty in cramming a sufficient amount of technical knowledge to enable them to qualify for a nomination. WVe are therefore glad to hear that this order is only preparatory to the establishment of a College for the instruction of Staff officers on a system which sball insure to the country the services of the best men who may present themselves. We shall be glad, in short, to see that the Report of the Conunissioners on this subject has not been " burked." It is pretty plain that even the lower branches of mathematics and the " colloquial "knowledge" of French or German which are declared necessary in the Order will be better learnt at some established place of military education than at a private tutor's in St. John's-wood, or out of school hours at Eton or Harrow. We trust, then, that Sandhurst may be placed on a proper footing, or some other College founded to do that which Sandhurst now fails in doing. A military College numbering its hundrsds of young men will soon generate its own spirit of emulation and its own corporate feeling. In a few years a new race of officers will arise as superior to the present as professionals in any pursuit are superior to amateurs. a In the meanwhile this educational test, however humble, will exclude some of the most unfit, and be a protest against the nomination
of any one who is plainly unqualified.

WELSH-SPEAKING BZSHOp&
Letters from Lord John Russell and the Earl of Derby relative to the appointment in Wales of Bishops who know Welsh are published by the Rev. B. W. Morgan Middleton. Be writes-" It is a matter of pubhl mud deplorable notoriety that the only bishops in Christen. dom who cannot preach the gospel or administer the holy sacraments in the language of the people of their dioceses are those of that portion of the church of England established in Wales The result is that nine-tenths of the Welsh people have seceded from a system which perpetuates in the nineteenth the most pericions cor. rptions of the pre-reformation centuries I beg most respectfully, to ask your Lordship, on publio grounds, as the leader and representative of an important party in the State with which the Church of England is by law conneocted, whether you wiU be prepared in Parliament to advocate the recommendation to the Crown of such clergymen only to fiU the four episcopl sees in Wales AS Are pWacticauy conversant with the language nd fcelings of the Welsh people?' agug n
Lord John Russell replies .-
"I agree with you that it is desirable that bishops in Wales should understand Welsh, and with that view recommended to the Crown the present Bishop of Llandaff, who had studied the language; but I cannot agree that the cboice of the Crowrn should be restricted to natives of Wales, aU other qualifications being made subordinate I fear it would be necessary, in order to a cormlete identity (f language, to confine the choioe not only to Wales, bht to the diocese in which the vacancy happened. However, I hould be glad to see any Welsh clergyman of learning and bility appointed to a Welsh see." Lord Derby replies:-

Tii UlnmTE Sr A25 ANTH ENGLiSH D -PuTE srrH CHL-It is said, happily not on indisputable authority, that the American Government has refused to cooperate with autiaud in the endeavour to bring the Cantonese and the Imperial Comunissioner to reason, and to establish the relations of the foreign residents and merchants with the Chinese inhabitants and officials upon a satisfactory footing. If this is really the case, the part taken by Mr. Buchanan's Cabinet is deeply to be regretted. The assistance which we might have received from the United States squadron in the Chinese waters would not, indeed, have been either necessry or inuportant; but it would bave been hot - satisfactory to the feelings and serviceable to the interest. of this country to enjoy the support of the United States in compelling the Chinese to afford redress for their past offences, and in placing matters for the fiuture in such a position as may effectually prevent the recuxrrence of such contests as the present. Had the Cbinese Government found that the three most powerfulnations represented at Canton were unanimously resolved to take vigorous measures for the repression of such outrages as those latelv perpetrated there, and were prepared to insist conjointlynupon the concession of full nd sudnicient guarantees against their repetition, and the establishnient of a system which should it sure a prompt and effectual settlement of all future disputes between natives and foreigners, it would probably have Deen found that even the obstinac of the Colestial empire wBs r,ot proof against such a combinattion t mnst be remembered that the Arnericans sre Also interested in the maintenance of peae and order in the ports opened to oreisgners by thu 13overnument of Pekin; that their trade, as well as ours, suffers by the continuance of the present state of things; that the lives of their citizens are quite as much endangered as those of British subjects by the exclusive fanaticism of the Chinese. The populace of Canton will care very little whether they immolate a free-born Yankee or a subject of Her Britannic Majesty; and the rabble of neighbouring villages, when aroased to frenzy by the appearance of a foreign garb in their streets, will care very little whether the inoffensive foreigner whom they hunt to death for presnxning to take a walk in the country was born under the union jack or the stars and stripe. The cause is onein which aU civilized nations who have any dealings with the Chinese ae alike interested-the cause of humanity and common sense against a ferocious barbarism. It is much to be regretted that tunder such circumstances there should be any doubt as to the sympathies of America. We boye that the report wbich has reached us is not only pren ature, but incorrect, and that no personal illwill to this country whicb inay he entertained by any memober of Mr. Bnchanan's Cabinet will prevent the President from acting, iashe iH imperatively reqnired to act, for the interests of butmanity and civiliz4tion, and for the protection, of his fellow-citizens in Chinia or engaged in the Chinese trade. It is manifett that the assent of America will he esenUtia, to any thorough arrangei.et.t of the difficulties which impede the cnmmunication between Chinese and foreigners; and, this being the ca.'e, it will he best that their course should be taken at once, asd that they should insist conjointly 'ith England and France. on a final and satisfact4ry aett`inuent (,f all matntrs in digpute, snd the adoption of such regulatione as voay enable the foreigi Powers to put i stop t'o the lawless con,luct of the Chinese populace and the prolix excuses of officials. Should the Government of the United States decliue to take part in this goAd '-ork, it must be done '%ithout their massistanue; but it wonld be more consonant with their national dignity and with a true and farsighted policy to ud'.pt ^ hold and energetic courne, and to take that position and exercise that influence to which their interest in the question eutitles thein.-M{aschecsir Guardean.

Mr. WRIGmr, pursuant to notice, moved, "That the Board contribute one-third of the estimated expene of purchasing certain premises in Fendall-street, Bermondser (estimated at 1601.), for the purpose of widening seh street.
lr. CARPNAB. seconded the motion.
3Mr. Deputy HBF&lso50N would move as an amendment the addition of the following words to the original motion" And that the like principle be adopted in all cases of lut. provement that reoeived the approval of the BoardL. He thought thatif ehe locality needed an improvement, and was wlling to eontribute two-thirds of the outlay, the Board, if it sactioned the project, ought to give the remainine third.
Mr. HO L TAYLOR seconded the amendment, which he coDnidered embodied a proper and intelligent principle.
-Mr. DOULTON thought the Board ought to Dromote loca1 improvements, but he considered the Board could render sufficient aid by enabling the various pariehes to raise fuands for local improvements and to spread the repayment over a number of years, and occasionally, where urgent necessity existed, to contribute a portion of the expense. He oon.* tended that the city of Lmndon improvements-at least, all the important ones-had beee'paid for by the metropolis at large; and the city now desired to throw the expense of improvements upon the localities themselves. As to the I amendment, he objected to it on the ground that it bound
the Board to contrbute a particular sum, whereas he could well conoeive cases to arise in which it might be desirable to give a larger or amaler proportion. As to the case of Bermondgey, he believed it would be politic to give the su3n asked for in the original motion, otherwise the Government would take the matter out of the bands of the Board, to the great detriment of local self-government.
Mr. Hows objected to discussing so large a principle as tilat involved hi the amendment witho .t due notice of motion,-a principle which, if carried out, might eventuall lead to the contribution of millions, and he thought that al
:mprovements should be dealt with according to the merits of each particular case.
Mr. DL1NXxs could neither vote for the motion nor amendmpnt. If he did so he conceived that he would be establishing a precedent.
Mr. D'IFFrANEE said that if the Board had unlimited nmeans at their disposal, of course all sorts of improvements n,liht be effected, but under present circumstancee the Board might refuse to expend any large sums until they had carried out the main drainage, two sew streets, and the parks. Money was not pouring in so fast as it was originally supDoe it would.
Mr. WARSsupported then motion, but did not consider by so doing that it would bind the Board to contribute to other improvements.
Mr. WXLIflSON did not think that the amendment was at all neoessary.
Mr. FEW supported the motion.
Mr. SsXLr.Y said he was the first to break ground upon this motion, in respect to Baldwin's-gardens, and thought it was the duty of the Board to go on in this line of actor, and adopt it as a principle. As to the amendment of Mr. Deputy Harrison, he thought it would unnecessarily tie the harnds of the Board and prevent them from dealing with perticular cases.
1r. DLXoN thought that a large amount of metropolitan improvements ought to take plce at the expense of Govem. mnent.
Mr. BURSLEM could not see, for the life of him, where aU the money that would be required for such improvements was to come from. They had not been called together to clt off the ends of streets or widen small ones, in particular thoroughfares. He could not vote either for the motion or the amendment. If it could be shown that this was a metropolitan improvement he would vote for it, bat he could not see that such was the case.
Mr. HANvxzs believed that Board had nothing to do with local improvements. The present motion wasa race for extravagance, and one of the wildest schemes ever broached in a public body.
Mr. CARPINIAL aid it was the duty of the Board to improve the poor and low district,, and bring theni up to a staudard even as high as Kensington.
a he CHArRxAN put the question, and declared tho asutntlment to be negatived by a large majority.
-Mr. Deputy HARRssoN then moved anotber amendment, merely omitting the word " like" from the former one.
This led to a further discussion, but eventually the original motion was pat and carried by a majority of 26 to 8. - After disposing of some routine matters connected with tbe chief engneer's and superintending architect's departments the Board adjourned.
The Reward Of Politeness.-M. Guénin, long
T1z RgWAniD OF POLITqESS.-M. Gu6nin, Iong known as a notary at Paris, expired not long ince, leaving to his fatily a very handsome fortune. He owed his =rsz advance in life to the following strange oircumstance:Forty years back X, Gu6nin, then a notarys clerk, and dependent on his salary for i living, resolved to establish himself somewhere in the departments. While looking roundto see wbere an opening umght present itself he was called by a hAwsuit to the centre of Frauce, and took his place at the diligence-office. Ten minutes before the moment for starting the clerk prooeeded, as usual, to call over the names of the travellers, when two of them stepped forward at the name of Gu6nin-the younz clerk and as
elderly gentleman. As the object in dispute was a corner seat, and as the journey was to last for two nights and a day, each was naturallv anxious to establish his claim. At 6.st the young man, addresitng his competitor, said, " Sir, y'ur age gives you an kdvantage which I yield to without a n,urmur, and I therefore re"uest you to take the seat in. dispute." The other consented, and the clerk placed hims, If in the middle by his side. The politeness of the youDg n,an naturally opened the way to conversation, and before the journey'K end the elderly travelier had learnt the whole historyof his companion, with his hopes of establishment and bis miodest atpiriLtions. " On your return to Paris," ',dd the elder personage, " come and see me. I know a good mnany of the gentleweu, connected with the law, aiid I muay give perhaps s','ne good advice." At the end of their jouruey they separated, the young man promising to pay a visit aH requested.

From Key West we learn that the scientific expedition sent out by Williams College left that place for Bahia Honda, in the schooner Dew Drop, on the 26th ult. They had been higbly successful in their xresearches in natural history.
The New York Chamber of Commerce had appointed a committee to proceed to Washington to request President Buchanan to strengthen the American fleet in the Chinese seas, for the protection of American interests and property during the war now Taging; also to appoint a Minister of high -character to represent our Government.

The Legislature had recently mrade some inquiry in regard to the habits of Judge Watson, and sufficient against him had been ascertained to warrant the serving upon him of a notice to show cause why he should not be impeached.
ihe Newt York- Herald of the 4th inst. says
"As we have all along predicted, the difficulty between 3pain and Mexico will be arranged vwithout recourse to war. Our Waihington despatch announces that the Spanish Minister has received intelligence from his Govermnent to the effect that the expedition which has been fitting out to -p0 te agninst Vera Cruz will not proceed to its destinrhon. A luore intelligent understanding of the question in idispute between the two Government,, together with the friendly interposition of France and England, has led to this result. An extract from the Spanish organ iu this city, which we publish elsewhere, confirms this imnportant new.. The enterprising parties in New Orleans and New York who have been so hopefully awaiting the commencement ot -hostilities will inow turn their faces to other fields, and perhaps Central America may receive a share of their attenuon. "
By the arrival at New York of the steamship Texas, from Aspinwall and San Juan del Norte, we have important rumours from Nicaragua. Two weeks' later intelligence fromi alker's head-quartei a at Rivas is stated to have been received. On the 16th of March the General, with 400 men, attacked the enemy at St. George; but, learning that another force, under Chamorra, was at the same time making a counter attack on Rivas, he returned thither, and on the way encountered them in full retreat, and hotly pur-ued by lenningsen. Being surrounded the -enemy were panic struck. The men met their fate with scarcely any resistance, and were slaughtered in g-reat nnmbers. They themselves admit to have lost 327 killed, and 300 wounded. General Walker 'was well supplied with arms, ammunition, and provisions. A rumour prevailed that Ex-President Rivas had been assassinated. No particulars are given. There had been no fresh engagements on the San Juan River. The men under Colonel Lockridige's command were still stationed at Serapiqui aiid on the island at the mouth of the river San Carlos. Colonel Lockridge had received large reinforcemnents, and his hopes of forcingr his way up the river and joining Walker were greater than ever.
From Peru we learn that the revolution continued to lose ground. The British mail steamer New Granada, ea rinte to Panama, had been met by two of Vivanco's revolutionary war vessels, and had been robbed of a large quantity of arms and specie. This act of piracy will throw the ruvolutionary fleet into the hands of the British men of war, and will probably be ti means of terminating the struggle m favour of Atesidont Castilbla.
The cotton-market at New York was active on the 3d inst., and the sales footed up about 6,000 bales, a large portion of which was in tran-situ. The transactions were based upon middling uplands at about 14fc., and middling New Orleans at
14gc.. closing firm at quotations. A private de- I spatch from Charleston quoted middling cotton at 34c., and stated that the market was much excited. Flour was rather firmer, esnecially for the lower and medium grades, with a fair amount of sales, including some lots for export. Wheat was held above the views of buyers, and the small sales made afforded no correct criterion of the state of the market. Corn was in good (demanid, with sales of new soutbern and Jersey yelow at 68c. to 70c.; old ditto at7Uc. to 72c.; and old white ditto at 73c. to76c.; Pork was heavy, with sales of new mess at $23 25c. to $23 40c.; for the inside figure a check was given on the day. Sawars were firm and in good demand, with free sales, which footed up about 2,000 hogsheads and 2,000 boxes Savannah. Cuffee was steady, but quiet. Freights were easier for corn to Liverpool, while other articles were unchanged, with a fair amiount of engagements. Teas were again active, and besides a public sale, which went off with spirit and at fall prices, about 6,000 half-chests of Oolongs (black) were rmade at private sale, closing at an advance of about 3c. per lb.
There was a very irregular stock-market on the 3d. Witll more than the usual activity prices were inuch urILettled. The tendency, however, was downward, and at the close there was a heavy feeling among speculators.

The New Grenada anchored in Panama Bay on the moring of the 21st nlt. Between the ports of Huanchaco and Lambayeque the New Grenada was boarded by boats from the Peruvian vessels of war Tumbes and Loa, and $32,000 and some cases of accoutrements, &o, which were on their way to Castilla's forces, were forcibly taken out of her; the strong room was broken open to get at the money. On arrival at Paita Captain Strachan entered a protest before the British ConsuL A passenger on board the New Grenada from Valparaiso has favoured us with the following nar; ative of this affair-
" On the 15th of March the Royal Mail steamer of the Pacific Steam Navigation Company, New Grenada, on her route from Valparaiso to Panama, was anchored in the Bay of Lambayeque, and had despatched to the shore her paswsengers and part of her freight for that place, when, at 8 a.m., she was boarded by an officer, armed with pistols and cutlas, from on board a Peruvian war steamer, which had followed her since the day previous from the port of Fluanchaco, and is one of those which had some weeks before passed over from, and been declared a pirate by the constituted GoverDment of Peru, under the President Castilla, to the insurgent General, Vivacco, at present in a itate of insurrection; the officer stating that he knew there were on board the company's steamer arms and money belonging to General Castilla; presentinga paper to urove his authority, and demanding them from Captain Strachan, who commanded the mnail steamer. This latter explained that he knew nothing whatever of the contents of the cargo; that the bills uf lading and ship's papers did not indicate any property as belonging to General Castilla,; that his duty was merely to take care of any property which was intrustod to him, and deliver it to the rightful consignees; ar.d, consequently, he could not give up anything to any one else. The offlcer in reply said that he was determmed to have th- packages which he demanded, stating that it was useless to resist, as he had force on his side; so that if Captain Strachan did not give them up he shouldtake them by force and that he onlr allowed five minutes to Captain Strachan to come to a decision
'Captain Strazhn then proceeded to his cabin, and was indicting a reply, an act ecarcelt possible by reason of the bs istwerous and repeated interruptions of the offlcer, literally rearing out that he would have nothing to do writh written answers, hut would only accept a erbal one, and that he uould not allow a moment more than the atead time before proceeding to foce.
"To write an answer in the midst of this disturbance was scarcely possible, but it was at last drawn up, and presented by Captain Strachan, accompanied by his officers, to the man, dressed as an officer, who had made the demand. He, however, refused to receive it, or any other than averbal reply,wbich must be simply categorical-' Yes' or ' No.' Captain Strachan repeatedly told him that there was his answer, this was constantly refused; and at last, on the repeated demands as to whether he would give him the moneyand goods he desired, or whether be should take them by force; Captain Strachan told him that he would not give them up with his consent, but having no means of resistance he could not oppose him by force; that if he took them it must be by such, and he could only protest against his aots, which must be on his own reesponaibility.
"Four armed launches were alongside; their crews were ordered on board, and about 60 men, with pistols and cut. lases, ostentatiously displayed, sprang on the deck, and oi ders were given thom to cut down any on board who should attempt to go forward.
" The whole affair was like a melodrama at a minor theatre. The men were of all colours-blacks, mulattos, and some few English sailors, who, however, looked cowed and ashamed at their position as forming a portion of as dirty, villanous a set of ruffians as could be brought together; most of them having a drawn cutlas in one hand and a pistol in the other, apparently eager for some pretext for seizing and sacking the vessel.
Tho man in command, to whom no resistance whatever was offered, now stormed out his orders in a voice of thunder. The vessel was taken possession of, six men being placed at the wheel, and as many more at the windlass A party provided with implenients for the purposewasordered forward to take the goods; they soon broke open the hatch. ways and abstracted a large quantity, which they carried off, besides breaking open other packages, which they partially robbed. During tbis operation others, wbo were appa,ently officers, opened the bar-room, and helped them. elves to liquors, forgetting, however, to pay for thesu in eturn.
"The money was, however, in the treasure-room,tbe iron doors of wbich offered nore resistance The fellow in command of the party came aft, and demanded the delivery Of she specie, or the key of the room. Captain Strachan told
,im that, being forcibly deprived of the command of his ship, he should give no orders whatever,
"' Well,' stormed out the "alant Peruvian, 'I will then be captain and give commands.' Large chisels and hammers were soon produced. the door wrenched off its hinges, and specie to the amount of S32,000 abstracted This, with 'he goods p'eviously taken, was then put into the launches
hich were alongside, and carried away.
I In a dead calnm, the British ensign hung drooping from its staff, as insulted and humiliated it dipped from the stern into the sea. The attacking party went off with their , rize, and to have completed the whole scene, nothing further was required than a martial band to strike up "Rule, Britannia," and the diapla) at the masthead, of a large burgee, with the proud motto adopted by LordPalmerston, ' Cttis Romanus som.'
" On board the New Granada, March 18."
Captain Strachan has entered a protest before the consul at Payta.
The Chili papers are unusually devoid of interest, being principally filled with discussions on the merits of the various railroad routes proposed. The President left Valparaiso for the capital on the 16th nIlt. Two smart shocks of earthquake were felt at Valdivia on the 17th, but no damage was done. The crops in the South promised to be short, in some cases not yielding more than the quantity of seed sown. Labour was scarce for harvesting, and wages consequently high. The Chili war steamer Esmeralda was sent on a cruize to the North, and Callo was presumed to be her destination, to watch Castilla's actions, his plan of procuring foreignera to retake the ship-of-war and fight the Revolutionists baving created considerable disapproval in Chill
The Chilian national schooner Colipi was wrecked at Coquimbo, and the Spanish ship Rosario, laden with wines, for Guayaquil, was burnt in ValDaraiso Bay on the 21st, and all her cargo destroyed.
Business during the fortnight ending February 26 had been unusually brisk, purchasers coming into the market from all quarters. Prices of almost all articles were a shade higher. Hides were in demand, at $17 per quintal; copper, in bars on shore, $22 per quintal.
There is very little news from the Republic of Bolivia. Thle country 'vas apparently quiet, but revolutionary moveiments were apprehended.
The PAciic Steam Navigation Company's steamer Santiago has been purchased by Castilla, the President of Peru, for 160,000 dollars.

MIND YOUR STEPS.-Some correspondence has taken p lace between Mr. George Burnett, of Dundee, aud Mr. George Armitstead, the candidate for that burgh at the recent election, relative to the rumour that Mr. Armitstead had danced on Sunday at Memel. Mr. Burnett ways:-" While travelling with Mr. Mason (of Memel), conversing on various subjects, he mentioned your name, and narrated having been in company with, and, as I understood, travelling with you and MIrs. Armitstead when yotv were iast at MemeL He told nie that he had a conversation with Mr. Armitetead about religious matters, in which he expressed his idea that there was more pretence in Scotland than real religion, and using such expressions aud arguments, if they may be so called, as are generally used in discusmin such a subject, and when he finiished the narration, ae added-'I wonder what sbe would have thought if I bad informed her that her husband danced in my house on Sunday the labt time he was in Memel' These, if not the ipsisiina rirba, certainly couvey the exact meaning of the words uLsed by Mr. Mason on that occasion. I must add that Mr. Mason on that, as weU as on other occasions, exprevsed himnsel f in favourable terms about you, and therefore Iam sure be would not wish to do anything or say anything to prejudice your character. As a friend of yours, Iowever, I must be pnrmitted to add that surely your nijemiory nmust have deceived you about the affair of your having danced vii Sund.y, as, although I have not mentio,ned the matter, I bave heard it commonly talked about both at MeImel and in this country; I can see no object Mr. Mason could have in making a false charga of the kind; and I t-el ouite sure be would have contradicted it if he could. nstead of thlis, in a letter to me, dated March 26, he say, ah.nmt a tWlegra ph which was sent to him on tho subject by, I uhink. Mr. Johni Don -'The telegraph of Tuesday I received, but you cannot expect me to give any communica. tioi n to what occurs in my private house by any of my Jrimndb visiting iiie.'" In his reply Mr. Armitstead says:-
- There can be no ' deception' in my 'memory' on the sub. ject, as I woulil tiot have violated my religious principles wi thout rememiiberinjg the circumustance. I bave such facts 2l.rady in my possesaion as will satisfy any honest-minded muan, and expeec to get further proof."-&o1.".4,

The Royal Mail steamer Magdalena had not arrived out at St. Thomas's at 8 a.m, on the 2d. The Clyde was on the Spanish Main route; the Conway at Barbadoes; the Dee at St. Thomas's, for Jamaica, and the Derwent for the Windward Islands; the Eagle at Jamaica; the Solent on the Gulf of Mexico route; the Thames, at St.Thomas's, for the Spanish Main route; the Trent, at Carthagena, with a broken shaft, to be assisted to St. Thomas's by the Clyde, on her way up; the Wye, at St. Thomas's, to sail for England about the 1st of May.
Movements of Her Majesty's Ships.-At Port Royal, March 27-The Imaum, Termagant, Tartar, and Victor. The Arachne and Falcon sailed on the 25th on a cruise. At St. Thomas's, April 2-The Basilisk. At Greytown-The Cossack, Archer, Intrepid, and Pioneer. The Orion was expected daily from Pearl Key. At Panama-The Esk. The Tribune sailed from Caillo on the 11th of March for China, and the Pearl was to follow from the Chinchas Islands. The Indus, with Admiral Stewart, had arrived at Bermuda, and would sail almost immediately for Carthagena. The Boscawen, with Admiral Fanshawe, bad sailed for England.
The United States' steamer Cyane was at Colon. April 16, in lat. 50 7 N., long. 6 55 W., the Atrato passed the brig Tompson. of Worldngton, atanding to the north-west. OfE the Lizard she passed a man-of-war steamer going to the westward.
Advices from Jamaica are to the 26th ult. Since the departure of the last packet few events of public interest had occurred. The Hon. George Cunningham, proprietor of Roslin Castle estate, in the parish of Trelawny, and senior member in the House of Assembly for the same parish, had been gazetted, and taken the oaths as Custos Rotulorum of the parish, vice the Hon. H. H. Shirley deceased. A disturbance took place in the General Penitentiary on the 17th of March. Some of the prisoners complained of an insufficiency of food, which not being increased in quantity, they began to pelt the officers of the institution with stones. As a precaution, a small detachment of soldiers was seit for, but before their arrival the mutiny was quelled. Three of the ringleaders were Bubsequently flogged within the prison walls. The Jamaica Railway, which had been temporarily closed in consequence of the necessity of building a new bridge over the Rio Cobre, had been partially reopened. The long drought in many parts of the island had been productive of serious damage, and a murrain among cattle was in existence. The prices of meat bad risen in consequence. Coffee was not procurable at latest dates under 40s. per 1001b. for ordinary quality. New corn was held at 4s. per bushel. No operations in cheese to report. Sales of several hundred barrels of flour had been made at 38s. The last receipts of alewives were placed at 24s. per barrel. Rice was very dull, and stock much in excess of demand. Last sales of pimento at 3d to 3id. per lb. Prime mesa pork sold at 102s., and heavy mess was held at 124s. per barrel. Sugar at 23s. to 25,. 6d., according to quality. Exchange on London-Jamaica and Colonial Banks-90 days, half per cent. prem.; 60 days, 1 per cent, prm.; 30 days, 1i per cent, prem. Private bills at par. On New York, merchants' bills 1 per cent. premium.
From Demerara we are glad to learn that the cholera had ceased to prevail in the city, and clean bills of health were issued to vessels sailing thence. The epidemic stiU lingered in some of the country districts, especially on the east coast, but it was gradually dying out. In Berbice the disease had run its course, and that country was almost, if not entirely, free from it. The weather continued wet and cold during the previous fortnight. The young canes had suffered much from the latter cause, and presented a very stunted and unhealthy appearance. The new Militia Bill had been introduced in the Court of Policy, and read a first time. A proposition had been made to the Governor and Court of Policy to make Demerara one of the stations of the submarine telegraph which is projected to connect the continent of South America and the West India Islands with Europe and North America. The proposition was looked upon favourably. Freights were very low-sugar, Is. 6d. to ls. 9d., at 2id. to 3d. Produce was scarce, and the supply of tornage over-abundant. Trade among the merchants was dull.
At Barbadoes the finaneial condition and prospects of the country were most satisfactory. The accounts laid before the House of Assembly for the quarter ending the 31st of December last showed a balance of 19,7371. 5s. od. in favour of the public, and the ordinary revenue of the quarter exhibited an increase of 3,4411. 9s. 9d. over the corresponding quarter of last year. Great activity prevailed everywhere, and the satisfactory state of the sugarmarket and the high price of produce had operated in various ways Ieveral sugar estates had changed
11u-s, arAd large prices were realized. The agCi&Ultural condition of the country was promising, and, the showers of the past month or two having brought the canes to maturity, crop operations were in active progress. A fair amount of sugar had been made, the yield of the canes being satisfactory. The produce shipped to date was reported to be:_ Sugar, 3,167 hogsheacls, 161 tierces, and 215 barrels; molasses, 376 puncheons. The young canes were clean, healthy, and vigorous. Labour continued abundant, and sugar was being manufactured at an average cost of about 11. per hogshead. The Dutch bark Snelheid, Captain ilenning, bound from Paramaribo (Surinam) for Amsterdam, with a cargo of 298 hogsheads of sugar and 45 bales of cotton, was wrecked on the Cobblers; not a vestige of the ship was to be seen at daylight. Of the captain and his son (15 years old), two mates, seven seamen, and a passenger, only the second mate and four seamen were saved.
A public meeting had been beld at the Courthouse at Antigua to hear Captain Raasloff's explana. tion of his submarine telegraph project, and a resolution of approval, proposed by the Lord Bishop' was adopteo.
The Legislature of St. Kitt's had been in anxious debate on the ill-fated Executive Council BilL The advisers of the Crown had not yet determined whether an immediate dissolution should be resorted to, or whether it would be more prudent to retain the pre3ent members on their easy chairs.
The press was eagerly urging the passing of a Medical

attendance upon the poor. The Govornor-in-Chief bad gone on a vsit to Dominica.
At St. Lucia the unusual state of the wvather at this aon of the year had completely oven brown all the prudence and calculations of the agricnljturists respecting the manufacture of produce and aU early shipment to the home market. In some part3 of the island the quantity of water had even been detrimental to the growth of the young canes by leaving pools of water in the cane holes, by which a rapid vegetation is checked; while, on the other hand, the planters experienced great difficulty in procunng dry fuel to take off the crop.
Captain V. Touchard, the new Governor of Gxuadaloupe, a;rrived at Basseterre on the evening of the 4th, and on the following morning landed and assumed office.
The present prospects of Turks' sLdand (says the ,Royal Standard of March 21) ae very cheering; at *Salt Cay and East Harbour several proprietors have aliready gathered small quantities.

Peace has at length been concluded between the H aytian Empire and the Dominican Republic. The French Admiiral, Count de Gueydon, has obtained from the Emperor Soulouque a formal renunciation of his pretended rights on the territory of the Dominican Republic; and he has gone further, and isnured interual peace to St. Domiingo by taking away on board one of his ships the exc-President
S5antana, who had been kept mn prison since theI accession of Baez. The ateamer Acheron, with Sa;ntana on board, arrived at Basseterre, Guadaloupe, on the 8th inst.
Captain Rlassloff, the projector of the submarine telegraph communication between the West India Islands, Europe, and America, arrived at St. Thomas's on the 28th ult, in the English schooner Angler, from Antigus.
From the Asp2nawall Cousrier of March 27 we learn that the President and Cong,ress of New Granada have refused entirely to negotiate with Mr. MIorse respecting the matters upon which he was commissioned to present the demands of the UJnited States' Government. They have further informed Mr. Morse that the Americans should be very well satisfied that there wvere no more lives lost, and that no more damage wvas done in the riot of the 15th of April. The answer of the New Granadian Government, of which the above is the substance, has been despatehed to his Government by Mr. Morse; and meantine, having suspended all commouncation with the aforesaid Government, Mr. Morse await the ansaero of his own at Bogota.
Great Exhibition Of Art Treasures.
d.BRAT EXRIBITION OF ART TRBEABE,.
(FRoM OUR OWN COBRmSPONfDEw.)
lA?CHESTER, AeRm 16.
There is no diminution in the daily arrivals of contributions at the Palace. Yesterday nearly 200 cases, some of them very large, were received by Mr. Deane, the general commissioner, and to-day the number is expected to be sdill greater. It is of the utmost importance that those who have not yet forwarded their contributions should do so as soon as possible, in order to enable the officials to have everything ready for the opening on the 5th. Notwithstanding the great additional pressure of business during the last few days, there has been no interruDtion of that order and regularity which have from the first characterized the management of every department of the Exhibition. Thus far not the slightest injury has been done to any of the numerous contributions already received. All the caution and care that could be desired by the most anxious contributor have been, and will continue to be, observed by every person connected with the undertalkig, and it may confidently be predicted that, unless some accident occurswhich it is impossible to foresee, and against which no human ingenuity can provide, every article in the colection will be returned to its owner in the same state in which it left him.
The collection of water-colour drawings will be exhibited in a galery at the west end of the building. There will be illustrated for the first time the history of that art for which England is so distinguished abroad, no continental school having as yet approached us in water-colours. The light ia distributed on the same principle as in the other portions of the edifice, and the gallery is capacious enough to contain more drawings than the room of the Old Water-Colour Society in Pall-mall-east added to that of the New Society in Pall-mall-west. The department has been placed by the Executive Committee under the superintendence of Mr. Holmes, who has been actively engaged for the last six months in visiting and soliciting contributions from the principal collectors of water-colour drawings. Mr. Holmes has made a very large and important coUection, showing the progress of the art from the time of Cosens and Girtin, who may be called the Van Eyck and Cimabue of painting in water-colours, to the present day. Every artist of any eminence is represented by his best specimens, and the gaUery, when completed, will be unrivalled as an exhibition of English watercolours.
The earlv history of painting in water-colours is illustrated by some of the finest works of Cosens, Girtin, and Barrett, contributed chiefly by Mr. Stanfield, R.A., and Mr. Leslie, R.A. The gallery also contains a choice collection of the best pieces of Varley, De Wint, Cristall, Glover, Havell, Nicholson, Pyne, Wells, and others of the leading artists who in 1805 founded the first Water-Colour Society. At that time water-colour drawings were mixed up in the exhibitions of the Royal Academy with paintingsin oil, -an arrangementto whizl- the water-celour artists naturally objected, and hence their anxiety to have a society and a gallery of their own. That the separation of the two branches has had upon the vwhole a beneficial effect upon both cannot be doubted. It is certain, at all events, that the advance which has taken place during the present century in the fascinatinig department of watercolour drawing dates from the establishment of an independent association, and the walls of the gallery under consideration amply prove how much the art is indebted both to the professional ability and the professional spirit of the masters whoso naes we have mentioned.
Passing along the gallery the attention of the visitor will be arrested by specimens of masters of a later period-of William Westall, Augustus Pugin, Charles Wild, and Copley Fielding. The examples of the last-mentioned are of the rarest quality. Nothing could be more interesting than to observe the influence exercised upon its younger members by the society established by Glover, Cristall, Wells, and their contemporaries. It seems to have inspired them with an intense desire to aswsrt, in the best and most effectual manner, by putting forth their whole porters, their equality with painters in oil, who were, perhaps, too much disposed to underrate their talent and their department of art.
The stream of historical art in water-colours is continued to the present day by specimens of all the leading members of the two existing societies. The varied excellences of Cox and Cattermole, Haghe and Warren, De Wint and Harding, Lewis and Haag, Taylor and Hunt, Muller and Fripp, are illustrated by examples which are familiar to all who visit the annual exhibitions in Pall-mall. Who has not seen and admired the " Weighing the Deer," by Taylor; the " Vesper Bell," by Cattermole ; the " Loading the Hay Barge," by De Wint; the " Hop Gatherers," by Cox; the "Falls of Tununell," by Harding; the " Encampment in the Desert," by Lewis? H ere, too, are many of the most beaxntiful drawings by Stanfield, Roberts, and Prout. It has been said that Turner was even greater in water-colours than in oil. That question is difficult to decide; but it is satisfactory, at aU events, to observe that his watercolour drawings in this gallery are both numerous and superb. They sbow howmuch hewas indebted. to Girtin, but they also demonstrate how much at last he surpassed his master. For so noble a collection of water-colours. the great value and beauty of which it would be almost impossible to exaggerate, the public are indebted to the generosity of the Queen and Prince Albert, Colonel Rogers, Mr. Moss, of Liverpool, Air. Birchell, of Preston, and Messrs. Henderson, Leaf, and Smith, of Londop, who are among the principal contributors to this department of the Exhibition.
The collection of engravings will be exhibited in a square room beyond the transept,on the south side of the building. It also has been placed under the charge of Mr. Holmes, who, with the assistance of Messrs. Paul and Domiiinic Colnaghi, of Pall-mall, has assembled together what the British Museum, with all its treasures, could not exhibit. A more choice collection of engravings, or one more thoroughly illustrative of the history of the art,
from the period When it Was rescued fromn obcur-hy by Marc Antonio iin Italy and Albert Dbrer irn Germany to the present day, does not exist, Sue.- mens will be seen here the intnnad value olf PMich exceeds that of mwny esteemed oil psintings Not a few of them are valued at between 3001. and 4M. each. Such an exposition of the art is greatly L'eeded in more respects than one. It will be reinombered that a few years ago it was asked in Parliament why the admirable engravings in the British usem were not exhibited to tie public fraed and glazed. We forget the reply, but nothing wras dons, and the engrainugs continue to be
reerved by Mr. Carpenter in portfolios accsible to cononisseur anld to thoee who cn shour a special claim to inpect them. Fc some time, however, the opinion has been gaining ground amongthose who tU&e aninterestil artthat,judgizg from the crowds which are always eolected round print8hop windows-vitness the gatherings at the ahops of Colnaghi, Ackerman, Graves, and Leygatt m London, of Agnew ane Son in Manahester, and of Grundy in Liverpool-tbhe public have- a greater liking for engravings thaa. our senators havehitherto been disposed to believe. The expense, too, of furnishing engravings with tbe best glass and small bead frames is so trifling tkat even a mevaber foLanbeth or the most rigid disciple of Mr. Hmne. could hardly object to a vote for so exceUent a purpose. The examples in this galiery were taken direct from the portfolios of tffleir owners and placed in appropriate frames made for the purpose-at the expense of the Executive Committee-by the delicate hands of Messrs. Colnaghi.
Among the chief contributors of engravings arethe Duke of Buccleuch, Dr. WeUcxley, Mr. P '6her, Mr. Hawkins, of Bignor, and Mr. Felix Slade. The specimens of Marc Antonio, Ecdhnck,. Nanu teuil, Faithorne, Hollar, Sir Robert Strange, Woollett, and Raimbach are exquisite; while those of our old mezzotinters-Smith, Faber; Fisher, and others-are so remarkable that they cennot fail to raise in the estimation of foreign artists the English school of engraving. All the most eminent engravers of the present day-Bran. dard and Wallis, Goodall and Willmore, Stephanoff and Cousins-are represented by many of their most admired productions, and ample Space has beeni devoted to some of the fin sat works. of French engravers. The collection, in short, is of an extraordinary character, and is expected to be one of the most attractive features of the Exhibition. One great charm of it is that it contains many exquisite engravings from pictures exhibited in other parts of the building. Thus the visitor will be able to walk from the painting itself to the engraving, and compare their respective merits. In some instances he will observe how much better the engraving is than the picture-as, for example, in the case of Woollett's far-famed engraving of West's " Battle of La Rogue "-while in others he may think that the engraver has not done justice to the originaL
The gallery round the north end of the transept Will be devoted to the exhibition of a numaerous and interesting collection of photographs, arranged by Mr. Delamotte, himself a skilful photographer, to whom the Executive Committee have given the exclusive right of taking a series of views of the Exhibition. The collection consists of samples of all our best photographers, and includes portraits of many of the most distinguished men of the present day. Prince Albert is a most liberal contributor to this department.

MORE LECTIoNEEING RIOTS.
After the close of the Antrim poll on Monday there was a riot in the town of Ballymena, an account of which is supplied as follows by the Banner of l&lster:-
" About 5 o'clock a dense mass of men congregated about the Court-house and down High-street, beyond Kennedy's hotel, and they shouted, gesticulated, and moved in a way which told the on-looker that they were not disciples of the Richard Cobden or John Bright school. Further up, beyond the post-office, an immense mass was seen pressing on towards A.inaworth's hoteL In the midst of these was John Rev, -of 80 DonegalIrtreeA, -who appeared to attract the attention oftthis crowd. Eb mtoied steadily on to the hotel door, occasionaly casting a significant glance at the " boys' around him. He stopped for a short time outside, apparently enjoying the demonstration, which appeared to us anything but friendly. Shortlyafterwards he ap. peared atone of the front windows, which had been forcibly removed to afford Mr. O'aara an opportunity of addressing the people. For a short time he did address them; but all on a sudden the speaker was interrupted by a voUey of stones, which crashed through the adjoining window, at which one or two friends of Mr. O'Hara's stood. A rush was made by the police in the direction from which the stones came and a scuffle ensued, the mob being victorious. At tsis stage the High Sheriff made his appearance, as well as the stipendiary magistrate, who endeavoured to dissnuade the people from abusing the police, but it was all in vain-stones were flung at them over the houses, out of entries, and along the street. We saw several bleeding profusely from stone cats. Stil the police refrained from inflicting summary vengeance on the rioters. A loud cheer near the mark-et-house announced the arrival of Mr. John Jellett, who rushed down the street towards the stone-throwers, at whom he gesticulated and shouted lustily, avoiding, as be went, the missiles which were furiously flung at the police. By an admirable manceuvre he succeeded in directing them down the street towards the bridge, and for the time being freed the police from the dangers with which they were surrounded. About this time companies of the 51st and 4th Regiments arrived, who formed opposite the hotel. They were followed bva troop of the Sth Hussar.-, wh%made several taeffectual attempts to clear the streets, which at this time were densely packed by a mob almost entirely composed of Orsaigemen. The magistrates, seeing the threatening state of matters, read the Riot Act. The mob not only refused to disperse, bu' continued to fling every kind of missile which came in their way aginst the Hussars, who were ordered to charge, and instantly they swept like lightning through the masses, many of the people receiving cuts and contusions of a very serious kind. Charge after charge was made before the rioters were dispersed and order was restored. In the mn6le one poor felow had his nose completely cut off, two or three of the H:ussars were unhonred, and agreatmany ridden don. When theyfonnd they could no longer witbstandthisshockther went in groups todifferent parts of the town, smashing as theywentseveral houses of persons, whose loss must be considerable. The rioters were draughted, we learn, into town to meet the 'Cr aigbilly men," who, they alleged, were to assemble in great force that evening, but who, nevertheless, did not come. A company of ship-carpenters from Belfast came down by train the following day, but their services were not required, and they returned in the evening, and evinced what their intentions were in one of the carriages by faUing on some feUow-travellers, who, but for the interference of Mr. Hlanson, the High Sheriff, and other gentlemnen, would pro bably have been inmates of the General Hospital to-day Several of the ringleaders were arrested, and bailed out on the folowing day by Mr. Jellett."

Although only a scanty supply of sport was provided, yet the. meeting was marked by incidents of nmch interest and importance.

Marshal Serrano had an interview yesterday with Count Walewaki on the subject of the quarrel between Mexieo and Spain. M Walewski is extremely desirous that this unfortunate affair should be amicably arranged, and is leaving nothing undone for tlshat purpose. The English Ambassador also is lending his co-operation, and indeed both Governmnents, acting as they are in concert, will leave nothing undone towards the pacifi~c solution of a difference whieh would be attendedv with such serious complications. A great deal, of course, depends on the Mexican Envoy himself, and on the nature of the instructions he has received. The latest despatches from Madrid corroborate what I mentioned yesterday respecting the moderate views of the
;panish Government, and their anxiety to settle the afiir if it can be settled without dishonour.
A private letter from Lisbon, of the 10th, gives some information of the intentlons of the Portuguese Government with respect to the affairs of China. An expedition is in course of preparation in the ports of that kingdom. It is composed of a corvette, a brig, a steam despatch boat, and a transport. The garrison of Macao will be raised to 400 men, selected from the best troops of the army. Macao was ceded to the Portuguese in 1579, in the reign of Henry, the succeesor of Sebastian, in recompense for the services which Portugal had rendered to the princes of the dynasty of Taitsing. In virtue of that concession, which was renewed in 1725 by the Emperor Yungehing, and again in 1790 by Kiaching, Portugal had the property of the establishment of Macao, which was administered by a Portuguese governor, while the Emperor of China preserved the right of appointing a Mandarin to watch over the interests of Chinese subjects. For the last 50 years, however, matters have changed. The Mandarin was allowed to assume the right of administration of the settlement, and cruelly oppressed the foreign population, while the authority of the Portuguese Governor dwindled Into a merely nominal one. Some years ago the Portuguese Commander, Amaral, who represented the Sovereign of Portugal, tried to enforce respect for the Portuguese flag, and was assassinated by the Chinese. Portugal, supported as she will be by other and more powerful Governments7 appears determined to profit by the present occason, and maintain her rights in China. The garrison of Macao will be plaeed under the command of a Governor, whose nstuctions are to re-establish in the settlement the authority of PortugaL
The Pays says:-
" A letter from London glves us some details relative to the instractions given to Lord Elgin for his mission to China. He is to have the superior direction of all affairs In that part of the world, and for that purpose he is to receive foU powers from the English Government, with 'Whom alone he is to be in correspondence. He is to decido on the opportuneness of all warlike operations, and to fix the time for commencing them. In case the authorities of the country should think fit to send propositions of arrangement, he is to endeavour to obtain the following concessions :-L. The old treaties are to be renewed and extended to eight ports of China, in place of five; and, in addition, English trading vessels are to have the right of putting In, from strees of weather or for repairs, to every point on the coast. 2. England is to have, like Russia, a college at Pekldn. The head of that establishment, which is to be composed of five members at least, is to be charged with all official relations with the Chinese Government. And, 3d, the English are to havo m ilitary posts in al the towns in which they have consuls or agents. A piece of ground shall be conceded to them at Shanghai, and another at Canton, on which to raise forts and form military establish. ments, the strength of -which shall be fixed by common accord. Inde pendently of these principal conditions, other secondary points are left to the judgment of the English Commissioner."
Letters from Marseilles of the 14th mention that the Grand Duke Constantine will arrive there on the 25th. He wiiU be received on his arrival by Colonel Fav6, of the Artillery, and Orderly Officer to the Emperor; M. de Belmont, one of the Emperor's Chamberlains; and the civil and military authorities of the city and department. The Grand 3Duke would appear to be somewhat startled by the great preparations for his reception. He has therefore prayed that he may not be made to figure in any very conspicuous manner. His journey, he says, is chiefly for the purpose of information and study, and he >refers being treated in a more quiet manner. Eie expresses a wish to decline grand evolutions, grand reviews, &c., and be allowed to see the countrv like a quiet well-behaved member of society. The lovers of display and effect are somewhat disappointed, but, I suppose, will acquiesce.
General Luders, who has been in Paris for some days (indeed, Paris swarms with Russians just now), has had a private audience of the Emperor. The General is, of course, traveling for his health, and intends passing the season at Yichy. The Russian Government has enraged for its steam navy several French engineers and firemen, at very high wages.
Feruk Khan had an interview yesterday with M. Hilbner, the Austrian Minister, on the subject, it is said, of a treaty of commerce.
Dr. Kern and M. de Hatzfeldt, the Swiss and Prussian Plenipotentiaries, had interviews with M. Walewski to-day; not at the same time, however, but separately.
The Government was, I believe, anxious that the elections to the new Legislative Body should be held about the end of June; but, the Minister of the Interior having consulted with the Prefects of Departments as to the most favourable period for that momentous operation, many of them have replied that, in their opinion, September would be the most convenient season, as the lours of the harvest will then be over.
Speaking of the Chamber of Deputies naturaUy remi ds one of the other branch of the Legislature -the Senate. This imposing body has been more than once twitted with passiveness and inaction in the great work of law-making. The Emperor himself thought it necessary some tune since to touch them with the spur. One Senator, M. Drouyn de Lhuys, decllned to submit to this treatment, and resigned his functions. I think it right, however, to say that the Senate has not always shown itself deaf to the call of patriotisn or apathetic when the Constitution of the empire was on the point of being violated. Some time ago a project of law imposing a tax on carriages was presented to the Chamber of Deputies, and voted by a large majoritsy. It was sent up In due course to the Senate, ~who decided that such a law was hi(ghly unconstitutional, and kicked it out. It may surely be permaitted to indulge the most sanguine hopes that by 'what or by whomsoever the glorious Constitution of the French Empire shall be hereafter touched in its purity or integrity, the patriotism of that venerable body will protect or avenge it. The rejection of the project of law for a tax of 100f. per annum upon carriages is a noble record in the annals of the Senate whtch posterity will not fail to look back to with pride. It is true that each Senator is himself obliged to keap a carriage, andthat he is the first who would be obliged to pay down. They who know the unselfish patriotism of the body WMll reject with becoming indignation the suggestion that the disbursement of five napoleona per annum had any. thing to do with their decision. The bill will be brought in again soon; be it so-the Senate will not be found wanting to the country, or to itself, on the trying occaSlon.

VIENNA, APRIL 14.
as soon as it was known to the Bdrtish and French Cabinets that the Austrian charg6 d'taloaires had been recelled from Turin the English and French Ministers at the Court of Sarinlia were instruted to advise Count Cavour to cheek the exuberant zeal of the writers for the GovernMental organs of the press. Sir damei
Hudson and the Duki e de flrammont obeyed thehse orders, and, for a time, the Corresponduof ItalienGe and thefOpaien abstained from those violent attacks on Austria in which they had so long indulged. Dut ng the last few days, however, the papers in question have displayed an inclinlation toreturn to theharge, anduareent numbermof the Cori-espndanee Ift'2isnns contains anarticlewhich the Austriuns decLare to be "most perfidious" The non-ofscial Ministerial organ asserts that Sardinia feels a great sympathy for Germany and it s a of the Confederation in very olattering terms. It was the object of the writer to call the attention of the Germans to the faet, that the hostility of the Satdinian Goverhment towards Austria does not extendto the other Federal States, and he therefore affects to consider Austria a non-German Power. As you are aware, the Imperial Government has repeatedly afnirmed that it is desirous to avoid any hostile collision with Sardinia, but it must be remembered that tho military force of austria is not under the control of the Cabinet. The Emperor is chief of the army, and it receives its orders immediately from his Military ! Central Chancellerie,which itotally independent of
the civil authorities. Connt Griulnne, who is at the head of the Military Central Chancellerie, is, with the exception, perhaps, of the Cardinal-Archbishop of Vienna, the most influential man in the empire, and on him the future relations between Austria and Sardinia will mainly depend. One great reason why reorganized Austria makes so littlereal progrees is that she has no Premier Minister, no man who enjoys the confidence of his Imperial Master in such a high degree as did the late Prince Schwarzenberg. At present there iS too little unity of purpose; earh Mouiniater goes his own way, and unfortunately it continually happens that it is not the way of his colleagues. It la a patent fact that whawt pleases Baron B3ruck displeases Baron Bach, and avics ersd, and Count Buol is so much occupied vrith foreign affairs that he has neither time nor inc]ination to attend to home matters. It iS my sincer6 wish that Austria may thrive, and become a Powar which shal inspire haussia wvith respect, but it appears tome that she is not in the right path. She attends too much to trifies, and consequently neglects matters of high importance. If the question is the curbing of the press, or bandying words with a second-rate State, like Sardinia Austria is never found wanting, but she seldom displays becoming energy in mattersof greater moment.
zorein policy is besides almost always of a negative kind, and consequently she does not enjoy that consideration to which her innate strength entitles her.
As you were informned in my letter of the 8th inst., the Paris Conference has done marvelously litle towards the settlement of the Neuchitel question, lf the information which has reached me be correct, France and Enland are beginning to lose patience with the King of Prussia, who still obstinately insista on his sovereign rights to Neuchitel being acknowledged before he renounces them. The Powers agree in thiking that Switzerland ought to pay a "ireasonable" indemnity-500,000f. perhaps-to Prussia, and Prance and England are eaid to counsel the Swiss Confederation to consent to King FrederickWilliam's retaining the empty title of " Prince of Neouchatel," as he seems to have set his heart upon it. Eis Prussian Ma. jsuaed styles coten g "Margrave of Anspach" but the IRjngsofsBaaria has never thought it worth while to pronest against hisdoing so. The Emperor of Austria still has "iCount of Hedapsburg" among his titles, but neir t he Centon of Berne nor the Swiss Confederation fears that he will lay cl isto sovereign rights in any part of Switzerland. The Berne correspondent of the Lravafort Post Zeitung says it has produced an unpleasant impression in Swstzerland that Baron von E[ubner supported Prussia during the sevensittingsCof the Conference; but the Swiss must not quarrel with Austria for displaying so much energy about a mere matter of form. She has tacitly recognized the reformed Federal Constitution, and she can render no greater servicn to Switzerland without giving offence to Prussia. The chances are, that if Prussia and Switzerland should remain obstinate, the Powers will, after having persuaded the contending partiese to ubmit to their decision, form themselves into a court of arbitration. If Russia and Austria should refuse to agree to this, France and England will probably declare that the Conference is dissolved, and for themselves recognize the independence of oweuchfpteL
The following paragraph, which is from the 9th volume of the 71erors of fhe l)uke de Ragzssa, deserves the attention of British and French statesmen. The question is the Treaty of July iS, 1840, for the pacification of the Levant:
"The Conference assembled, and the protocols accumu, lated, wiithout the parties being able to; come to an under. standing. Cabinet messengers traversed all parts of Europe, but without result. lFrom the very beginning Bussia assumned the best and moat becoming attitude. She refrained from interfering. Strong in the advantages resulting from her geographical position, Russi well knew that, as the principal heir to the Ottoman empire, she would be able to lay down the law to all at the momentt of its falL. She saw, however, in the difference of opinion which prevailed
between thOe Engish and French Cabinets a mseans of breaking off an alliance which offended her. She decided to make sacrifices, and to gIve a new ' face ' to the London Conference by drawing nearer to the Whigs, who were then at the head of affais. Although the Emperor Nicholas had a strong and well-founded antipathy to England, itwas not so strong as that which he felt for Louis Philippe. He thought it would be a great victory to put an end to an alliance which he abhorred, and It afforded him inexpresible pleasure (une jouitsane indicioze) to separate two allie3 who, after hsving been separated for so many centuries b opposing interests anacient enity, had been brought together by the force of ctircmstances In order to attain his aim, no complaisane to wla s too great.

The French Marshal observes that het s unable to undeBrand how Austria and Prussia, who were influenced neither by their interests nor by their passions, could become parties to such a treaty.
A person who is well informed on all RLussian matters states that the postion of Count Valentine Eaterhazy, as Austrian Minister at St. Petersburg, is almost untenable. Great reserve is displayed m official circlen if any mention is made of the unsatisfactory relations between the two Governments, but the end of the matter will assuredly be, that Count Esterhazy will receive a prolonged furlough, and leave a simple Charg6 d'Afares to carry on the current business.

(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDEN.)
BERIMl, ApRim 15.
Last night I telegraphed to you the news that had arrived here from Copenhagen, that the King of Denmark had the evenung before accepted Herr Von Scheele's resignation as Minister for Holstein and Minister for Foreign Affairs. This news, unexpected as it was, and considerably more satisfactory than any well-wisher of Denmark had ventured to expect, is at variance with the apparent probabilities of the case, as I described them to you in my le.ter of the 11th inst., and which I find corroborated in all the correspondence I have seen from Copenhagen since the first intelligence of all the MUiisters having resiged became known. The circumstance of the Minister for}ioreignAffairs having been invited to the Royal table a day or two after the resignation of the M iv to meet Duke Carl of Gluicksburg and the Royal Pinces, and of a long audience which preceded the dinner, seemed to show that the reconciliation with the future heirs to the throne, which he had manceuvred for in his late anti-Scandinavian circular despatch, hadtaken place, and that therefore lIerr von Scheele was now tirmer than ever in office, while his colleagues, who have abided consistently by their Scandinavian, nastlonal, and Eider-Dane convictions, were to be thrown overboard. On the 5th, the same day that the break-up of the linistry took place, the King visited Prince Christian of Denmairk, presented his congratulations on his birthday, and communicated to him his promotion to the rank of LieutenantGeneral; and everything seemed to augur that the despotic Russian-like system known to be affected by~ the heir-presumptive and heir-elect to the throne had obtained the ascendancy by the open rupture of Herr von Scheele with its opponents On the 11th there was a Council of State held in the Palace, and, though its reasults as to the acceptance of the several resignations of the Ministers did not transpire at the time, aU the journals of Copenhagen were of the same view, that Herr von Sc;heele would retain his former position in the favour of the Kng, and would be commissioned to formna new Mmiistry. That he would find the greatest difficulty, amounting almost to impossibility, in doing so was also to be foreseen from the events of last autumn when, after four weeks of incessant being and negotiating, he was obliged to offer the Presdency of the Council to Herr von Andrae, who despises and op-
,and the Ministry of the Interior to r eger, of whom he had said that he would never sit at th same table with him. It may be that Herr von Scheele has already arived at the conviction of the impossibility of his conducting the Government any further, and has consequen-tly acquiesced in his own retirement.
In the first telegraphic despatch, announcing the resignation of all the Miuisters, it was carefully stated, on the part of the correspondent in Copenhagen who sent it off, that the break-up of the Ministry was not occasioned by any foreign influence. It may be true that the ultimate occasion of the rupture was mere personal incompatibilities in the Ministry, which found a special vent aud expression a propos of the manner in which the late communications were made to the Rigaraad with reference to the Sound Dues redemption; these were, singularly enough, all broug,htto the knowledge of the Danish Council in Gerroan, although,
lmost without exception, the members present all understood Danish, and it has hitherto been the fashion on al occasions to use the Danish language, whether the German members present understood it or not. On the other hand, it is not to be doubted that the conflict with Germany has beenl the real, thoukgh the indirect cause of the rupture. The Rigsraad was to meet again on the 14th inst., when the Holstein members who had
hitherto stayed away, that they might spend! Pasion Week and iEaster with their families, intended to take their places in Oouncil in full numbers - and the three weeks' time for reflection that the derman Powers had allowed to Denmark on the subject of her treatment of the German Duchies would expire at the end of the present week. All, the
Ministers, with the exception of Herr von Scheele,I are Eider-Danes, and consequently more or less
favourable to Scandinavians. Herr von Scheele has1 of late taken to opposing both these views, while his own treatment of the German Duchies has brought Denmark into very serious complications. It appears, therefore, that Herr von Scheele retires from office either because he cannot find men to work with him, or because the policy he has hitherto followed towards Holstein and Ljauenburg must be abandoned. Baron von Plessen, formerly Ober-Preeident of Altona, whom Herr von Scheele not long since deprived of his office on recount of his patriotic opposition in the Holstein Estates, was sumnoned to Copenhagen on the 14th inst., and it seems highly probable that he will be made Minister for Holstein, in the place of the man who lately deposed him. If this takes place Denmark will have to congratulate herself on a great danger escaped, and on a better course being entered upon; the Scandinavian union with Sweden and Norway will have become sil more practicable, the renunciation of the entire-monarchy scheme more probable, the restrictionof Denmark to theEiderfrontier almost a certainty, and theyrescue of the German Duchies from incorporation into Denmark all but attained. In a letter from Copenhagen of the 13th inst. I read that, in fact, the King of Denmark is well disposed, and intends to accede to the propositions last made to him by the German Powers; these do not go so far as to require any revision, and much less repeal, of the preeont entire-monarchy charter, but require only that the sx paragraphs in the Constitution lately octroy
O Holstein, on which the Estates have not as yet been allowed to deliberate or make their voice heard, shallbe submitted to them for their aequiescence. It was by means of these six paragraphs that the Danish Government had abstracted from the cognizance of the Holstein Estates all the subjects of vital interest to the duchy, such, for instance, as the management of its own State domains, &c. In the course of the summer the Danish Government promises, as I hear, to convoke a special session of the Holstein Estates, and it will then be for the Holsteiners themselves to protect their own rights.

SIR JOHN BOWPING ON THE CHINESE
BABBABITIES.
The Liverpool Courier contains the following letter from Sir John Bowring:-
" Hongkong, Feb. 2.
toccMy dear Sir, -I doubt not that it wil e a gratification to my Maux friends to hear from the best authority that we are all recovered from the effects of the poison of which several hundred persons partook on the 15th of January. About 10ib. of arsenic had been mixed with a batch of bread issaed from the largest Chinese bakery in the colony, and the excess of the quantity led to iiniediate alarm,applicaffon of emetics and speedy ejection of ' the perilous stuff.' It left its effects for some days in racking headaches, pains in the limbs and bowels, &c. In my family, my wife, daughters, three guests, my private secretary, and myself, besides several servants, ate of the poisoned bread.
LayBowring's has been a bad case, as it I7s thought some of the arsenic had got into the lungs, butt danger is over now. This mode of warfare is hard to deal with, and will, I am sure, excite a general sympathy and indignation. Large premiums have been offered by the Mandarins to any who shall set fire to our houses, kidnap ormurder us and many unfortunate wretches of all nations (as the hatred of the Chinese is indiscriminating) have been seized decapitated, and their heads have been exposed on the wall of Canton, their a8sassins having been largely rewarded; they have even torn up the bodies of Christian men from their rve in order to decapitate them and expose their mutilated sklls tothe public gaze. All this is sufficiently horrible, but I doubt not the results will be most beneficial, for certainy we shall exact indemnities for the past and obtain securities for the future. We shall not crouch before asassination and incendiarism, you may be assured. I did all that depended upon me to promote conciliation and establish peace.
whi auobviously mys duty, hut every effort I'made was treated with scorn and repulion. The forbearance with which the Chinese have been treated has been whollmis.~ understood by thqem, and attributed to.our apprehenmons of their great Pwe -and awe of the majesty of the I Son of Heaven.'

COURT OF BANKRUPTOY, Basinghaurt,,a,

IN BE THE ROYAL BRITISE BANK
(f r f
(Bcforc 3fr. COMMn93uncr HOLROY-D.E
This wag a meeting for the proof of debts and declaration of dividend.
Mr. Tter appeared for the assignees; Mr. Bagley, Mr. Roxburgh, *nd Mr. Aiory appeared for creditors.
An application was made on behalf of Mr. Ransay under these circumstances :-Mr. RaIsay kept a deposit account at the bank; also a drawing account. There were due to him at the stoppage 7501. on the former, and 691. on the latter account, and a proof had been admitted for that amount. Mr. Ramsay took 10 shares of the bank of its third ad last issaue, just as the bank was on the eve of stofping payment, and at a time when the directors of the bauk and Other officers must have known that it was insolvent. Mr. Ram. say had not been made a contributory by the Court of Chan cery. The assignees had, however, stopped the payment of the dividend on Mr. Ransay's proof, end au order wa now asked upon them for its paymrent. An alleged liability of 5001., upon a call of 50L per share upon Mr. Raimy's 10 shares, was the only ground upon which the dividend warnnt oould be withheld.
MrT. LiKLATzaa"id, he had not receivea any notice of the present application. It was impossible in a case where there were 4O000 creditors to be prepd to maet an application of this. hind withouat notice.
Te Comussr8oim concurred, and an adjournment was ordered.
Mr. BRoxBnGuI.-There is another application I hAve to make which I think ought to be made at the same time. ort is an aplicationo prove a debt against the oftt nbehalf oMrPou,wow Ioadepositor in the Royal Brts &k o tesm f20 nal oOOl as for money had and received by the bank.

Mr. LnuuriTi-Ianrighy understand the object with which this apitonsmAde nd I ca ae h efrect of it. It ce wouldbebetter-
3 Mr. ROXBURBG.-Had not you better hear the grounds of m2 application to prove?
Mr. TI -I apprehend you cannot go into the question now. Let me see the proof.
Mr.RoxB:stunG.-I-propose to doitby examination of witnesss vi voce.
Mr. LnixnTrxa-You wfil he good enough to presnt a proof as that is the way to deal with it. When you co.a
ider the question of the proof, it should be before the Court in a proper form. Is Mr. Proud here 2
Mr. ROXUItUGH.-Yes; it can be done by examniation If the Court thinks fit, and I amquite sure that in a case of this description your Honour would, prefer to adopt that oourse, or perhaps it should be reduced to s. deposition. In theXmonth of August, 1855, Mr. Proud, being a customer of the bank, on or about the 18th of August went to the bank, when a clerk there named Brookes persuaded him strongly to take sres in the bank- that the directors were about to ie a series of new shares, and it would be lighly advantageous for him to do so. He saw Mr. Gatherell, who is a manager at a branch office, and in a weak moment Mr. Proud consented.
3fr. IT ELATE&.-Of which branch do you mean ?
Mr. RoxBuncGH.-The Strand branch; and on the 18th of August, on his being told that 101. per share was all that was required according to the circular in respect of those shares, he paid on the 18th of A st 1001., being 101. per share, and the receipt was in this form :-"Received for the Royal British Bank, from 3r. James Froud, 1001., which is placed to the credlt of his deposit account opened upon application for newshares in the bank book here. Signed, George Anderson, for Cashier; William Gatherell, for the accountant." Matters remained in this state. Mr. Froud heard no more of it til the month of December, 1855, and no doubt many of these dates willbhe fresh in your Honour's recollection in connexion with the circumstances of this bank. Mr. Proud then received this letter:-
Mr. L£1KLTEB.-WhSo is tha signed by ?
lIr. ROXBInBGuL-By Mr. GatherelL Then a letter was written to Mr. Gatherell by Mr. Proud, expressing his surprise at being called upontopay on th.se shaes, inasmuch as he had been toldby a circular which was isued in September, that the remaining 401. per share was to tpaid at the convenience of the shareholder, who would in the meantime receive 41. per share; and to that letter a reply was Mrqested, but none was sent. Within a fortnight of that time he saw the manager of the bhak again at the Strand branch, and complained of the application for the money. The manager stated the object was to have the shares fully paid np and to comply with tho requirements of the Board of Trade. Then Mr. Gatherell sested 'hat Mr. Froud should accept bils for the 4001., but that he refused to do. Mr. Froud again went to the bank in May, 1856, and said he should be ina condition to pay up his shares on the 35th of June, which was the time mentioned in the circular, but that he felt very uneasy about paying the money, as he had heard something respecting thebank and doubted its stability. The manager assured Mr. Proud in May, 1856, that the bank was as sound as the London and Westminster Bank, although the shares were at a dicount observing that it was a bon fcde undertaking, and that they did not do as other banks did-rig the market. Mr. Froud then paid another 1001. on the 23d of May, after this conversation with Mr. Gatherell-I made a mistake - Mlr Dickson is the manager of the Strand branch and Mr. Gatherell is the manager at another place. On the 30th of June Mr. Proud again called and saw the manager, and again referred to his fears from the rumours he had heard about the stability of the bank. The depreciation in the price of the shares was stated by the manager to be caused by persons taking up new shares having to pay up their calls. Mr. Froud, a simple man, was satisfied with this representation, and gave a check for the remaining 3001. on the 30th of June, 1856. He then received a letter, enclosing the receipt, and was requested to call and sign the deed, and early In July Mr. Froad called at the bank, and was taken into the office by Mr. Gatherell, and he s1gned his name in the book, which I presume was the deed, with a few fly sheets for signatures, and then the certificates for the 10 shares were received by him. Within a very short time after this the shares became more and more depreciated, and Mr. Froud, being alarmed, again saw the manager of the Strand branch, telling him if anything occurred to the bank it would ruin him, and the manager then assured him again that the bank was in as good a postion as any bank, and if Mr. Froud did sell the shares he could not get rid of his liability, why did he want to sell them at a sacrifice ? He asked him to buy more, as they were low, but he could give no advice ; all that he knew was that the bank was good, and Mr. Proud said he should like some further information, and the manager rave him a letter of introduction to the manager of the head office in the city. Mr. Froud went there (this was in the middle of July, 1856), and upon being introduced to him the manager said, "You are one of the new shareholders,'
shook hands with him, and begged him to be seated, and gave him a long explanation as to the position of the bank, and said 3r. Cameron owed no money to the bank which was not amply secured, and that none of the directors owed a spence to the bank. He further stated that the bank had sustained a loss certainly not exceeding 20,0001. Mr.
roud then inquired if there was a dividend. The manager then said there would be one, but that it would be less than usual, as the directors wished to make good the whole loss out of the dividend. Then Mr. Froud stated that he had heard that the accounts had been " cooked," and the manager
T.uLwTEI.-Does he give the name of the gentle. mau who made that statement ?
Mr. ROXBURGHL-YeS, Mr. Craufur.L Mr. Proud called again on Friday before the bank stopped, and saw the managing director, Mr. Macleod, who told Mr. Froud that he had been connected with the bank from the formation of it, nd handed a printed balance-sheet to him which was said to represent the true state of the affairs of the bank. Mir. Froud said he would take it with him and consider it; at the aame time he said he heard that they were about to make another calL .Mr. Macleod said, " No- they would never make another call." Mr. Froud alluded to the application for shares, and Mr. Macleod stated that as soon as they were at the lowest, the directors were about to buy them all up (a laugh) and that they would rise as fast as they had fallen (laughter); and! ass proof of that, one of the directors had purchased shares at 401. per share the Friday before the bank stopped. As Mr. Froud was going from the bank, hlr. Malleod took him by the hand into the bank, and asked him if he wanted to buy upsbaresi(laughter): andthatone of,the directorshadbought sares at401. per share, and that person might go to a broker who had shares to sell. Mr. Proud unfortunately did so. These are the facts which I shall prove by the evidence of Mr. Frond, as the circumstances under which hetook the shares in the hank. I shall also ask you to use upon this proof the evidence that has been given in this court by W.r Esdaile and by Mr. Apaley Pellatt in reference to the affirs of the bank at the period to which this proof is directed, and then I shall ask to be allowed to prove for a sum of 5001., as money had and receivedby the bank of Mr. Froud, on the ground that he has been induced by fraud to take the shares, that the contract is wholly void on the ground of fraud, and that Mr. Froud is entitled to recover back his money. That is the evidence Ipropose to give to-day-the evidence of Mr. Froud, Mr. Bsdaile, and Mfr. Apaley Pellatt. With reference to the drawing account I apprehend there wfll be no difficulty. As to Ithat, I apprehend the assignees will make no diffi.
culty if the amount stated is coirect. Under these or. cumstances I submit that Mr. Froud is entitled to prove for the amount of the 5001. received by the bank, and I need not caU your attention to the cases which have held that where a party has been induced to take shares in fraud he is entitled to recover back the money he paid for those shares. That was decided in the case of "Watner v. Sharp,"
"Burns v. Pennell," and several other cases.
The COMMSSIo t-" Burns T. Fennell" Was on th:s
point; it was a Scotch case, which was decided in the Vouse of Lords.
Mr. ROXBURCOL-Yes, Sir; and I need not say that this is a question of very grave importance respecting the sharebolders, and they must by some means or other obtain the decision of the ultimate tribunal of this country upon their liability in respect of these shares,-the liability contracted
under the circumstances I have detailed. If there ever was a case in which the money could be redeemed under a contract on the ground of fraudulent representation, this is that case. The manager of the bank represented the
bank to be in a perfectly solvent state-the capital as paid, that the directors did not owe a sixpence to the bank, aud representations of that character, which are endorsed by the bank directors, endorsed by the general maager at the head offlice of the bank, and are pat into the hands of the party bulg the shares-that the capital wras all paid up, and that the oney was invested in convertible securities, when, in pointof fact instead of that being the case, the bank was inmsolvent. I suppose if there over was a case in which to rlie a man from the consequenes of a contract of that kind this is that came, and my clint is desirous of putting it In a way of trying the question before your Honour. I thenru fore sabmit to you, when the evidence is taken, that if I
stablixhlsuekaisea shl enUtle mr to reoove at law upon the fa, I shall bays etabluh.d a tight of proof ; and if you shall be of opinion that the ce ig lot one of those cases, my chent, if le think fit ca by.a ,,ry hort and xpeedy procee try ethe Iqution before the Court of Appeal, which wouldo le expenslive and more speedy for the determination of the queseion thian any otaer course of proceeding than am be sugeostd; asdtherefore it is that I shall press this proof attr? givmg the evidanee oE Mr Froud, coupled -with the evidencoe of Mr. sdaie and Mr Apsley Pellatt.
TheCorma ssisoNR- With respect to the factg for the present purpose, I will take it that the ft are as stated by the learned couuseL Assuming the facts to be as he says, I shall have no difficulty in disposing of the cue8.
Mr. IDNKLATE.-Your Honour wil permit me to stato that this is a pablic sitting for the purpose of A dividend A great deal of business is to be done, and there am several matters requiring your Honour'X attention as well as my own.
The Co3M8so,rnt.-I am going to dispoes of it. Mr. ROXBUsGil.-With great ubmission-
Mr. LTNxrAvxa.-I ask your Elonour not to digpose of it. Mr. RoxBuRno.-I apprehend I am entitled to prove a debt.
The COMrsSrONMRn.-Yes; and I must dispose of it.
Mr. IarNLATan.-I ask Tour Honour to adjourn the consideration of this inquiry mn order that the assignees may be prepared to meet the ase which the learned consel prowpoes to make.
The Cos?,t srozu.-I Will state my reon.
Mr. I&TLATEB.-At present there is no sufficient e.idence, and if we go before the Court of Appeal we should be involved in a labyrinth.
M/rr. ROXBUIRGL-I Wish to avoid that by taking tho evidence; then I could Crry it to the Court of Apejwith the evidence of Mr. Esdailo and Mr. Apaley Pellast.
Mr. LflTBLABTz.-I object to the evidence of Mr. Eadaile and Mr. Apeley Pelhtt being used.
3r. RoXBUBOH.-Then I propose to examine them sagain.
Mr. LT'lih A .-That is what I wish you would do.
The COMUISSIOhN-An examination that wouldoccupy any length of time cannot be gono into now. I will allow you afterwaras, if it be necessary, to take the evidence with a view of going elsewhere to get the opinion of the Court of
ir. RWOX:BURGH.-Sir, as far as the question of proof is concerned, if the assignees would consent So put the facts I have stated in the form of an auidavit, to be taken as evidence, I havo no obJection.
M{r. LIxArs.-No, no.
Mr. tioxnus'3n-If not, then I tender mry eient for The COMMrMOb n.R--Then it must shtnd over for that purpose. I cannot let one gentleman interrupt thecourse of the business of to-da. It is a very common course to adjourn any matter when it requires more than ordinary consideration.
Mtr. RlOXBnUR.-This ig certainly a matter requIring consideration.
Mr. LINKLaT!B.-Your Honour max remember that mY fzlend, Mr. Field, on the pert of 70 or SO new shareholders, made a smilar application tothat which the lerned counsel has made.
The CObns OMM.-I MAy state at once the ground on 'Which it appears to me that no proof can be admitted under the banlruptcy. After the cases which have been deter. mined at law with regard to the liability of a shareholder who May have been induced to take shares by fraud or misrepresentation, it seems to me that a peson who stands in the position of having bwen induoed to take shares by the fraud or misrepresentation of an individuaL, whatever evidence you may have against that individua, who may have deceived yoU, you cannot have the right of proof against the partnership; and for this remon. If he is iable as an individual partner to the creditors of the partnershi,
it seems to me it is quite lear he cannot prove sist the partnership, which would be a proof against those who stands as creditors to him. Execution might isue aainst hin as a shareholder who has appeared to the world as a partner, and therefore he is under all the liabilities of a shareholder. According to the ordinary rule in bankruptcy, a person in that situation cannot prove in competition with the other creditors.
Mr. R0XBURGH.-Sir, with great submission, that is not my case, and therefore I wish to go Into it fully, If your Honourwll give me an appointment. My case is totaly di;tinct from the case your Honour put.
The Cosmm o Rt.-I understand you to say that Mr. Froud was induced to take these shares by fraud or mis. representation.
Mr. ROXBURGE.-It never has buen decided by any court of law that he is liable to reditors.
The CoSso N-I understand the learned counsel to state that Mr. Froud haa signed the deed.
Mr. RoxBUnoH.-Just so; but that is not all that is necessary to make him liable to creditors. In the case that Mr. Field brought before you the parties were returned to the Stamp-office as shareholders, and that made them liable to creditors. My client never was returned to the Stampoffice, and it never has been decided by a court of law that he is in an way liable to creditors. It will be my duty to submit to t'le Court that he is not in that position, and all I -ak is that I may have an appointment for the purpose of taking evidence.
Tho Co3MISSo0z1TER--You are quite right in asking that. Mr. ROXnuRG.-Then, Sir, I will take anappointment, with your permission.
Mr. INnLATZR.-Considering that this is a similar applcation to that which Mr. hield made the learned counsel cannot very well expect to get through it in a day. I thInk Mr. Field had four days.
The C'osrauso-NlR.rhe learned counsel may have an appointment.
M3r. ROXBUGr.-I will undertake not to be an bour.
thiy-£ r1 x.--.ey observation is with reference to
s application coming on at the same time as the others; it is ,te clear it would be useless to take one day.
lhe CoMsIsWoIN-It would be useless, I think.
Mr. ROXBURGE.-Then, your Honour will be good enough to name a day. I am quite satisfied that this question of his possible claim cannot by possibility take an bour, if it is not oontested by the signees. If the examination of MT. Esdaile taken by the assignees is allowed to be read it cannot take an hour. After the opinion your Honour has intimated It will be very short.
The COssM TSSIOI -I am very sorry not to be able to accede to what you wish, bat my experience in this court bas led me to know that it is impossible to say how long a matter will take, and, therefore, Icannot do it upon the Assurance that it will not take an hour.
ar. ROXBURGH.-MI I can say is that It ought not to take an hour. We could get through both matters in one day, and it would be a great convenience to my cUent
The Commissioner then appointed the 27th day of April and the 4th of May to hear Mr. Roxburgh's applcations.
An appliation was next made by Mr. ASORY, on behalf of Mr. ucan. Macdonald, for an order upon the ainees for the payment of a sum of llOL., under the foUowing circumstances:-Mr. Macdonald was a merchant abroad. He transmitted to the Royal British Bank biUs of exchange to the above amoLnt, for *oUection on his behalf. The proceeds of the bils were not received until some time after the bank had both stopped payment and it had become bankrapt. The amount had passed into the hands of the official manager. That gentleman did not dispute the validity of Mr. Macdonald's claim.
Mr. LntxATEB said, the official manager had paid over to the assinees, by order of the Vice-Chancellor a sam exceeding100,000f . He bad, however, been allowed to retain 5,wvl. to meet demands that mnighit bo made upon the est*te. There was no evidence that the sum paid over to the official assignee in a lump included the specific sumn now claimed. ~ ~ de
The COstarSO sssER. held that M?. Macdonald most apply to the official manager. There was no sufficient evidence that the specific sum claimed had pssed to the assignees.
Mr. AMsORsY said, he should brng an action against the official manager.
Mr. BAGLEY tendered a claim on behalf of Mr. Myers under these circurmstances :-Mr. Myers had entered into a contract to make for the bank certain alterations in the South Sea House. He had received a sum of about 6,0001. on account of that contract, and he now sought to prove for the balance of account. The admission oF the proof had been delayed a considerable time, and Mr. Myers was without a dividend. Hope so long deferred had made Mr. Myers very sick, and he trusted the proof might be no longer delayed.
Mr. LWNLATER was instructed to say that Mr. Myers had no cdLim whatever. The contract, as produced, set forth that a sum of 7,3721. should be paid by the bank for
-ertain alterations, and there was a proviso that Mr. Myers should be subject to a penalty of 100 per week if the contract should not be completed within a certain time. It wasnot, as he was informed, fully completed within five months of that period, and the assignees were even at the present time without the requisite vouchers from the surveyors, Messrs. Nelson and Ince.
Mr. BkGLty said the orginal contract had been departed from by consent, and that asum of 15,0001. had been agreed to be paid instead of 7,f)000 Additional alterations were required2 and which required also an extension of the period over which the contract extended.
Mr. INXL.t^AT said be wras informed by Mr. Paddison. soicitor to the bank, that the contract had not been duly fulfilled, and that Mr. Myes had subjected himself to the
ponalty m ientionea therein. -If h- (r ter) wasr rightly informed, Mr. Myeors was a debtor rather than a creditor to the estate.
Mr. Myers complained of the delay, on tho part of lr. Nelson, in furnishing information. Ultimately an adjommment was lordered that evidence might be given in sapport of the proof.
Wr. IJNKELTER said, on a previous occasion Mr. Field (Sharpe, Field, and Jackson) appeared for upwards of 70 clients who preferred claims to be admitted as creditors for the same reasonsl as those now given by Mr. Roxbh on behalf of Mr. Ramsay and Mr. Proud. He (Mr. Lin ter) had taken care that these claims involved an amount of 60,0001. or 70,0001. No examination of the directors should take place until they had been disposed of. He had received the letter (now read) from Mr. Sharpe, undertaking that the whole of the clauns were relinqnished with the exception of two. In the claims of these two shareholders there were peculiar circumstances. It was to be regretted that Mr. Roxburgh did not take the same course as Mr. Sharpe. He _tIr. Linklatcr) now asked for an order in accordance withte contents of Xr. Sharpe's letter, relinquishing the claims.

A claim was put in by Mr. James Evans Green, trustoo for the directors of the General Friendly Institution of Iambeth, for the payment in full of a sum of 201. 10.
Mr. LINKLATER Was Willing to leave it to the Court whether this Was a case within the provisions of the Act of the 10th of George IV.,in respect to the payment to officers of friendly societies duly enrolled, of debts due to thoce institutions in full.
The CosrsuIssSoIN-j referred to the heading of the bank pasbook, and said, the account appeared to have been opened in the name of the trustee of the institution. He could not consider that a trugtee was an offioer of the institution. Tbe proof could therfore be admitted only as an ordinary debt.

31r. LIu AT ,-Sir, with referenoe to the estion ?o the bank at preaent, it is inportant that I should eoomunz. cate to you the result of the proceedings up to this day The debts p roved atte_etigpeiusly o thad imontday
to 514,14!. s. ,d. The proofs of to-day amount to about 4f0001, andyourHonourb h eritteda claim to be entered of ,00., makin a total of proofs and claims today of 9,000 .; 5O that tne total amount already proved and claimdd would be 5230001. A dividend has been already paid of 5s. 6d. in the pound, and theassignees are in a oition to-da
to declare a further dividend of 2s. 6d. in the pound, and I Am happy to say even the money asets of the estate are not yet exhausted, for, if with ordinary diligence we have good luck, we hope to be able to make a further dividend of 2a. in two monthr, or even 2c. Gd., and I tust even then that the aets wi not be exhausted. It is Imuportant that I should make this communication to the Court because the forthcoming session of Parliament is one in which it will be incumbent upon those who have the interest of the creditors at hest, for the purpose of enabling the assignees and those who are anxious to bring about some general compromise, to take measures for that pupose. It may be, and it has been found exceed. Intly diicult, dealing with so many creditors and so rany de tors, to bring all to a common understanding, but we have succeeded in getting from certainly more than hal
the creditors their assent to the com?romise which has been proposed by the shareholders of 6s. bd in the pound beyond 'what the assets in bankruptcy will realize. The dividend which has been declared and that which is to be paid to-day will amount to 8s. The further dividend under this bankruptcy we have no doubt Will amount to 2s. oertainly, and posibly to 3s., and that will enable the assignees to make a dividend under this bankruptcy of lOs or lls. in the pound. If it were but ios. in the pound, the 6s. 6&L which is offered by the shareholders would increase the total composition to 16s. 6d. in the pound, and it certainly does strike one as being most desirable for the creditors, and certainly for the shareholders, to use their united efforts to bring about such A reselt; and the asignees have exerted themseves, and the committee of depositors have been unremitting in their duties for the purpose of aiding in this compromise, and it is hoped that no step taken by any person will have the effect of preventing that taling place. It is just possible that the iunfortunte delay which has arisen from the dissolution of Parliament may have deprived some of the shareholders of the means of paying the contributions with which they might have been prepared. Even that I hope will not endanger the general result of it. Then I should h?o Parliament would *ve us some power of dealing with a shareholdor byr himself, and enable us to discharge him from his liability to creditors generally; however much in theory it may have been considered good, inasmuch as it involves un. limited liability, it has been found in practice to be detrimental to the interests of those whom it was intended to serve. The result of the proceedings here, I have no doubt, Will give satisfaction to the creditors. They will see that
with a certain dividend in bankruptcy, and with a fair ,rospect of that which will be got from the shareholders, It is their interest to withhold proceedings until those who have been intrusted with their mterest in the end obtain that advanta e for them which they have asl long desired. The divide.d, owing to the very great exertions that have been made by the official assignee, audI may say by Mr. Cooper and others in his office, have enabled us to say that, though the number of creditors is ao large, the dividend will be payable on and after the 28th of April, and we shall have the use of the South Sea House, which has been sold for 11,000D., the fittings being taken at 1,4001. That 12,4001. this day will not come into the present dividend, and therefore we shall have a certain further assetan available ready-money asset. I have also the satisfaction of being able to say that a vessel belonging to Mr. Humphrey Brown, the Ellen Lindsay, is on her way. We expect from that and other securities to realize 1,0001, or 1,5001. a a future period, and therefore the prospects to which I have referred ar ex-cedin yfair, and Ihop may be realized at no distant period. We have had a most able and satisfactory report from surveyors of considerable eminence,-auctioneers, 'ith reference to the Welsh works, and we are not without hope that A sum exceeding possibly 40,0001., if we should be fortanate, will be realized for the estte. If we were so successful the dividend which I have mentioned would be in. creased, because there are other debtg outstandinz -uhich possibly, by very good fortune. migSt increase the dividend
for this estate even to 2s. in the pound. I am quite sure the assignees will spare no pains to bring about so desirable a result. It will be one whichIthinkwill be creditable to the ad. ministration in bankruptcy, one for which we have all fought very eagerly. Your Honour was pleased to name Wednesday next for the examination of Ir. Alderman Eeunedy. Mr. Alderman Kennedy is abroad and unable to attend on Wednesday, and it is oonsidered desirable to delay Mr. Eumphrey BroEws examination till after Mr. Aldermn
ennersb he poses to be here on the 29th. The time Inot be lostb = We have the exceedigly impor. tant duty of examining the auditors and accountants, and there will be also, in consequence of the singular and extra. ordinary statement of Mr. Stapleton, necessarily a short further examination of him. I do not wnt to say more upon it at present, but I propose, with your Honour's permission to proceed on Wednesdav next with that examination, for the prpose of shownng that some of the statements have bewithout foundation. The 30th inst. is appointed for the last examination, and the assignees had hoped that the balance sheet would have been prepared and filed by that time. I have no doubt the accountant who has been employed by the ignees for thepUrpose has found his duties exceedingly laborious, and no doubt he has been diligent in the preparation of it- but, having regard to the several periods at which rests iave to be made he has found it impracticable to file it. I a. told that a very few days wll see it completed, but I can scarcely hope that there will be sufficient time between this and the last examination to allow the assignees to give it that attentionL which undoubtedly it would receive rat their h nds.
-The CODLLIrSVSbOXE.-There is only one thing that one
desires could have been added to the statement mads by Er. Linklater-that 20s. in the pound would be paid, which in the case of a joint-stock bank the public always expect
should be realized. Looking at all the circumstanes oft this unfortunate case, it may be desirable that the compromise should be carried out, which is perhaps more than we might at one time have been led to anticiDate
Mr.LIKiLsTM .-That is so, Sir. The great mistake which the shareholders made was in not coming forward at once witb such a sum of money as would have prevented the sacrifice of their property; it would have been undoubtedly the best policy, and would have been the most honest, There is an additional advantage which the assignees have now whch they did not possess beforenamely, the assistance of Mr. Wyld, one of the members for Bodmin, who has promised his assistance in conjuncetion with the Attorney-

LI@,YD V. TIlZ SOIUCITO1RS A,ND GENERAL LIFE ASSUACE
R?l-V
(Before ahe LORD CHA?4CELLOR.)
This was an appeal from a decree of the 'Master of the Rolls. The bill was filed by Rebecca Lloyd, the widow of Jomn Lloyd, who died in November, 1S54, to have the benefit of A purchase of a hfe interest in a bum of 3,6541. 10s. 9d Bank Annuities, made by her husband in the month of MIrch, 1848. It appeared that the plaintiff was entitled during her coverture to considerable property settled to her separate ose, that her husband's means were very limited, and that he was obliged to petition the Insolvent Court in the year 1852. The question at issue between the plaintiff and the assignee of her deceased husband rested entirely on the balance of evidence as to whether the purchase-money (865).) paid by John Lloyd was his own money, or was
handed to him by the plaintiff as savings out of her separate estate. There was another question in the suit between the plaintiff and the assignee for value of Edingtsn, the vendor of the life estate, as to whether the whole purchase-money had been paid. The Solicitors Assurance Society were the cortgagees in possession of the property. The Master of the Rolls decided in favour of the plaintiff.
MIr. SELWYN; and Mr. MORGAN, as it was an appeal from the whole decree, opened the cas. for the plaintiff.
Mr. Toller and Ur. Walf ord appeared for the appellants; Mlr. Follett and Mr. Adams for the trustees.
The LoRD CHANCELLoR, in agreeing in toto with the hlaster of the Rolls, said that, although primd facie the purchase-money was the money of John loyd, the evidence was conclusive as to the fact of its having been handed to
ini by the plaintiff out of the savings of her separate estate. The Master of the Rolls was also quite right in directing an inqpiry to ascertain whether all the purchase-money had been paid, and therefore the appeal must be dismissed with costs.

EX PARTE iIARPER, IN RE JONES.
The facts relating to this case were that Messrs. Harper and Parry Jones entered into a renewed partnership in 1843 to continue for their joint lives, and it was thereby agreed that on the death of either partner the survivor should pay an annuity to such person or persons as the other partner should appoint, to be paid half-yearly during the joint lives of the widow of the pre-deceasing partner and the surviving partuer, or that the surviving partner should durng the same time pay to such appointee or appointees one-fourth of the profits of the business. Mr. Rarper, on his marriage, settled this annuity with other proprerty upon his inteaded wife. He died before 1851, and subsequently Mr.-Parry Jones became bankrupt, and Mrs. Harper claimed to prove for the arrears of her annuity up to the bankruptcy, or for the value of the annuity, or that she might have an account of the profits. It appeared from Mr. Jones's affidavit and other evidence that Mr. Harper died very greatly indebted, together with his partner, upon the account of the partnership. Mr. Commissioner Balguy decided against the claim oi the widow.
Mr. Kenyon supported the appeal; Mr. Bacon and Mr. De Gem were for the assignees ;Mr. Charles Hall for the bankrupt.

EX PARTE THE v ICAR OF ST. MARTIN%', STA.MFORD
sARON, LN RE THE MIDLAND RAILWAY COMPANY.
In this case the Midland Railway Company have taken eertain lands belonging to the vicarage of St. Martin's Stamford Baron, in Northamptonshire, and the purchase. money, amounting to 2,0001., it was now proposed to invest in Three per Cents., and the only question arose as to the party to receive and apply the dividends. The vicar had been and was now incapable of attending to the duties of his office, and the secretary of the Bishop of Peterborough bad received and applied the income in paying a ourate, &c., and a petition was now presented by the son of the vicar, asking that the dividends of the 2,0001. might be paid to the secretary of the bishop, to be applied in the same manner as the income had heretofore been applied by him during the vicar's incapacity, the residue income only amounting to 147/.
Mlr. WVIIITELEY appeared upon the petition, and, after some discussion,
His HONOuR made the order as asked.
IN RE PALMER'S SErrLEAIENT.
Mr. SMYT1TE appeared in support of a petition by the tenant forlifof a sum of 2,6001. Three per Cents. for the *ppointment of now trustees, under the Trustee Act. It appeared that there were originally four trustees of the fund, then 2,0001. only, but now increasedby accumulations; the survivor of those trustees died in 1832, and the parties In whom it was now vested by representation were two ladies, who had been appointed executrices of the will of a representativo of the suiviving trustee. Four persons were now proposed, two on behalf of each set of parties, and the coats were asked to be paid out of the eorpus of the fund.
Mr. H. R. YouN a, for parties entitled in remainder, said that the parties whom he represented were oontent to allow the fund to remain as it was, and did not think it necessary that trustees should be appointed- the tenant for life was the person for whoso sole benefit tils application was made, and he ought to pay the costs.
Mr. Ware appeared for the parties in whom the fund was vested.
The VICE-CHANCELLOR thought that the corfur must bear the costs. It was quito within the ordinary scope of the duties of any party when all the trustees were dead to procure new ones to be appointed.
(Before Vice-Chansellor Sir J. STUART.)
TIlE COURT.
The VICE-CIIA,NCELLOR in the earlier portion of the day, eaid that the atmosphere of the part of the court in which he sat was so offensive that it almost incapacitated him from proceeding with the public business. He suffered no much yesterday from the foul atmosphere he had inhaled in the-court that it was with difficulty he continued sitting until the usual hour, and when he rose he was quite unwell. Unless what he complained of was remedied he should be unable to sit in this court.
It may be unnecessary to state, what all will expect to hear, that the contrivances for ventilating the court are most clumsy. Fresh air can icarcely be admitted without causing a strong draught, and through an aperture made in the ceiling for the purpose of enabling the foul air to escape a shower of blacks frequently falls on ,the bar, to their no small annoyance. Nor does that part of the court which is appropriated to the bar and the public enjoy an immnunity from those odours of which the Vice-Chancellor complains. The breezes which a person meets on entering the court are certainly not of the fragrance of those " Sabexan odours" which.cause the mariner to slack his course as he sails by the ' 8picy shore of Araby the blest."
The VICE-CIIANCELLOR disposed of several petitions, opposed and unopposed, but none of them furnished any materials for a report.
(Before Vice-Ohancelor Sir W. P. WOOD.)
CRESSWVELL V. HANKINS.
The VICE-CIIANCELLOR delivered judgment in this case, which, however, presented no feature of public interest. The chief question in the suit arose out of the special customs of the manor of Dymock, in Glocestershire, as affecting an alienation made some years since of certain lands held of that manor by a tenant in tail, who had afterwards procured from the lord a release to him and his heirs in fee of the seignorial rights; and which alienation his Honour held binding on the issue in tail, though not having been made by fine or recovery.
Mr. Rolt, Mr. Jaames, Mr. Chapman Barber, Mr. Whitbread, Mr. Herbert Smith, and Mr. Stiffe were for the several parties.
GEDYE V. THE DUKE OP 3HONTROSE.
This was a motion inthis suit on behalf of the defendant, calling upon the plaintiff to elect whether he would pro. ceed at law or in equity as to an alleged trespass, in respect of which he had commenced proceedings at law. The suit in equity had been instituted by the plaintiff for the rpecific performance of an agreement for the sale to him of the defendant's leasehold interest in certain premises at Twickenham, called "Little Marble-hill," and also for compensation by reason of the plaintiff hanng been kept out of possession since the 1st of December, 1856, and for an inquiry to ascertain the amount of such compensation, and for the delivery to the plaintiff of the formal possession of the premises. lt appeared that the plaintiff and his family had gone down on the 5th of January to take possession and had remained on the premises, notwithstand"ig tat the delivery of formal possession was refused by the defendant's agents, on the ground of some dispute as to the precise terms of the agreement. While the plaintiff was on the premises, the defendant, treating the plaintiff and hisfamilyastrespassers, hadonthe27thofJanuarysentto the house some men (as allegedbythe bill) "of lowcondition," who remained there untl removed by an order made in this suit on the 31st of January. By this order an qesm ent to the plaintiff was also directed, which was execu y the defednnt andbor dat the5th f Jnuaye useunl to is obaiin ths rde te laitif meddhsbl,b statng hathad husbee don, ad cmmecdpo

The 'Vicz-CnANcELLOR decided that the plaintiff must elect. The action at law related to the identical subject. matter of the suit in equity and of the compensation thereby asked, which compensation it was clearly compe. tent for this Court to ascertain in the suit. The interloeu. tory order obtained by the plaintiff in January had been the means of giving him an assignment of the premises, which amigninent, by being executed as of a date previously to the trespass comnplained of had the effect of conferring on the plaintiff a legal title anterior to such alleged trespass, by which he had been enabled to put on the record at law a declaration in the particular form of an action of trespas, which he could not have done wrhile the case only rested in contract, This was an accident which this Court could not allow to-^vary its settled ruleathat where a plaintiff had come to equity for relief, he could not at the same time put his claims nuhder the jurisdiction of a Court at Law,
The plaintiff elected to proceed in equity.

Sir. F, ThESIGER (with whom was Mr. Webster) moved for a rule to ohow cause why there should not be a new trial in this case, on the ground of misdirection. The action was brought to recover damages for the infringement of a patent, of which the plaintiff was assignee, and which was originally granted to a Frenchman, named Etienne Masson, for improvements in the preservation of vegetables, &c., for fleets and armies. At the trial, which took place before Lord Campbell, at Guildhall, at the sittings after last term, the plaintiff failed to prove that the assignment of the patent to him had been registered in the office of the Registrar of Inventions, as required by the 35th section of the 15th and 16th of Victoria, chap. 83. Under these circumstances Lord Campbell said the plaintiff must be nonsuited;* but, as he declmed to be so, and appeared, his Lordship directed a verdict to be entered for the defendant on the sixth issne,which raised the question whether the patent had been duly assigned to the plainti£ The learned counsel said he was quite taken by surprise by the objection.

BAGGALLY V. DAVEY.
Mr. HKEATING, Q. C., moved, pursuant to leave reserved, for a rule to enter the verdict for the plaintiff for 1001. The action was brought to recover damages for a trespass in breaking into the plaintiff's stable and taking away his horse. The defendant, among other pleas, pleaded not pDOsessed. At the trial, which took place before Mr. Justice Crowder at Stafford, at the last assizes, the plaintiff proved tiat he had purchased the horse of a man named Nix for 1001. on the 26th of September, 1856, and that he kept it tiU the 2d of February, 1857, when the defendant, who was a veterinary surgeon at Birmingham, went into his stable, took out the horse, and carried it away. He then sent and told the plaintiff what he had done, and gave him his address. Nix was called, and confirmed the plaintiffs evidence as to the sale of the horse. The defendant was caled, and swore that he had not sold the horse to Nix, but had only lent it to him; but it appeared that he (Davey) had been insolvent and 8wore that he had no horse. He (the leasned counsel3 had taken two points-firast,; that there was a good sale ; and, secondly, that the defendant was a trespasser. The jury found that there was a good sale to Nix, and that there was a vestmg order before the sale to Nix. In these circumstances the learned judge directed a verdict to be entered for the de. fendant, but gave him (Mr. Keating) leave to move to enter the verdict for the plaintiff for 100l. The learned counsel contended that, notwithstanding the vesting order,'the plain. tiff had such a possession as would enable him to maintain the action against the defendant, who was a mere wrongdoer.
Lord CAMPBELL said the learned counsel might talke a Rule nisi granted.
KEINZBICK V. HORDER.
M1r. EDnwnef JAMES, Q.C., moved, pursuant to leave reserved, for a rule to enter a verdict for the plaintiff for 201. Th e action was brought to recover damages for criminal conversation with the plaintiff's wife. At the trial, which took place before Lord Campbell, at Guildhall, at the sittings after last term, Lord Campbell held that it was necessary for the plaintiff to prove the marriage, but reserved leave to him to move to enter the verdict in his favour for 201. The learned counsel said the question now was whether the plaintiff was bound to prove his marriage, it not being trversed by the defendant's pleas. The declaration charged that the defendant " debauched and carnally knew tho plaintiff's wife ;" to which the defendant pleaded only the general issue. The question depended on the construction of 16th Pleading Rule of 1853, which said that, " In actions for costs the plea of not guilty shall operate asa denial only of the breach of duty or wrongful kct alleged to bave been committed by the defendant, and not of the facts stated in the inducement, and no other defence than such denal shal be admissible under that plea; all other pleas in denial shall take issue on some particular matter of fact alleged in the declaration." The learned counsel contended that the marriage was admitted on the pleadings, and that if the defendant wished to deny that the person debauched was the plaintiff's wife he ought to have pleaded a plea to that effect.
Lord CAMPBELL said the learned counsel might take a rule.-Rule ni,i granted.1
SCHUSTER AND OTHEBS V. MAEELLAR AND ANOTHMR.
Mr. BOVILL, Q.C,, moved for a rule to show cause why there should not be a new trial in this case, on the ground that the verdict was against the evidence.
The action was brought to recover damages for the conversion of 50 tons of spelter shipped on board the Emperor, but of which the defendant had improperly siened blfs of lading. At the trial, which took place before Lord Camp. bell, at Guildhall, at the sittings after last term, it apw,ared that the plaintiffs, who were merchants in London, had Purchased a arge quantity of spelter, upon an arrangement which they had made with Messrs. Coles Brothers that they should have the goods for exportation, on the plaintiffs being satisfied as o payment. The defendants were the owner and captain of a ship named the Emperor, which had been chartered by Messrs. Van Notton and Co. for a voyage to Calcutta. The charterers putthe ship upasa generalship, and having employed brokers to obtain cargo, Coles Brothers engaged freight for the spelter on board the sahp. The course of business was, when the goods were put on board, for the shipper to take the mate's receipt in exchange for the goods, and on a subsequent production of the mate's receipt the captain signed the bin of lading. In the present instance Coles, who had engged the freight, appldinto the brokers for the bill of lading but without p reducing the maWs receipt; and they, finMing from the sip's returns that the goods had been put on board, delivered the bin of lading. It turned out that Coles had got the bill of lading without the authority of thejplaintiffs, and had immediately endorsed the same over to the Oriental Bank as security for an advance. The present action was then brought, on the ground that the defendants had improperly parted with the bill of lading without obtaining the mater
receipt. The plaintiffs obtained a verdict for the value of the spelter, 1,200L The learned counsel nowvcontended that the verdict was against the evidence, which sbowed that the broker was justified in parting with the bill of lading to the party who engaged the freight, on being satisfied by the ship'a returns, or by the cargo book, that the goods had been put on beard.
Lord CAMPBELL said the learned counsel might take a rule to show cause.

Mr. MnWARD said the present action was brought to recover a penalty of 501. from the defendant, who was high bailff of the County Court of Liverpool, for practising as an Attorney in that Court, in violation of the 29th section of the 9th and 10th of Victoria, cap., 95, which provided that no persn holding the said office should act "1as attorney or agent for anyary in any proceeding in the said court.," At the trial, which took place before Mr. Baron Martin at lAverpool, at the last ass8ies, the plaintiff obtained a verdit, but leave was given to the defendant to move this Court to enter the verdict in his favour. The leanmed counsel said the rOceedings taken in this case were under the Absconding Sebtore¢ LAct (the 14th and 15th of Victoria, cap. 52), andL were all in the Superior Court; but an application had been made to the judge of the Country Court ior the arrest of the debtor. T was not " a proceeding in the court," biut an application to the judge personally, so that the case did not come within the section.
Lord CABIPBELL said the learned counsel might take a rule to show cause, and, as the same question was raised on demurrer, they might both come on together.
PARKER V. SHDWELL,
Mr. Serieant Srsstst moved for a rule to show cause wh
the verdict entered for the defendant on his plea of justilyi cation should not be set aside, and a new trial granted, and why a verdict should not be entered for the plaintiff for 111. The action was brought to recover damages for giving the plaintiff, who was the defendant's butler, into custod upon a charge of stealing his (the defendant's) plate. T
defendant pleaded a long plea of justification, which in substnce stated that the plaintiff had charge of the defendant's plate, and of the chest and loset in which it was locked up, that a portion of the plate was stolen, and that the defendant gave the plaintiff into custody in the belief that he had stolen it. At the trial, which took place before Lord Camp. bell, at Westminster, at the sittings after last term, several questions arising on the defendants plea were put to the jury, and on their answers his Lordship decided that the defendant had reasonable and probable cause for what he had done, and directed tho verdict to be entered for the defendant. The learned serjeant now contended that there ought to be a new trial, but the Court expressing ai strong opinion to the contrry, the learned serjeant moved, ipursuant to leave reserved, to enter a verdict for the plainti', on the money count, for the sum of 111. This sum had been paid by the plaintiff tothedefendant when he was in custodiy, and in order to procure hi5 liberty,
ana to get nri of the criminal charge. 1'he jury had found that the defendant believed the plaintiff to be guilty, but that tho plaintiff was not guity, It was said the parties had compounded felony, and as they were in par!idel*co, the plaintfit could not recover the money which he had paid. Tho learned serjeant, however, contended that the parties were not in part delicto. The defendant, undoubt. edly was to blame, for he had received the money, believing the plaintiff to be gauilty. But the plaintiff knew that he was innocent, and in paying the ll. he had done no more than pay the money to get rid of an unfounded charge, In fact, he was under duress and imprisoned, nd having been thereby induced to pay the money, he was entitled to recover it back.
Lord C0spBELL said he had already expressed his opinion that the ill, ought to be returned to the plaintiff- and he was dsapointed that that had not been done. AG Lord-

The action was brought to recover damages for breaking and entering the plaintiff's garden and damaging his wal], &C. The defendant pleaded that it was not the garden and wall of the plaintiff. The trial took place in Sussex, before Mr. Baron Channell, at the last assizes, when it appeared the parties were tenants in common, and that the defendant bad taken the coping off the wall and built upon it, and had assumed exclusively property in it. The learned baron thought the action could not be sustained by one tenant in connmon against another, but the learned counsel cited authorties to show where the circumstances amounted to an ouster, as was the case here, trespeass could be maintained.

GLA?-VThLE V. YMER.
Mr. Francis Was counsel for the plaintiff, and Mr. Serjeant Thomnas for the defendlant.
The plaintiff kept a coffeeshop at Islington, and the defendant kept the Norfolk Arms publichouse, in the neighbourhood of Bethmal.green, where a loan society was held. The plaintiff wanting a gum of money applied to the loan society for a loan of 601., aud it was arranged that a bl of sale should be given of a billard-table and other articles for 601. The assignment -was absolute, but subject to a proviso forredemption upon payment of 601. before the 30thof January, 1858; butthe plaintiffoovenanted to pay 101 every three months until that 601. should be re-paid. Only 501. was advanced. The first instalment was not paid in October when it became due, and in December a person named Walton, accompanied by another man, went to the plaintifi s house and demanded the payment of 101., being the first instalment. The plaintiff said he was not then prepared to pay, but should have some money shortly, when he would pay. Walton said that would not do for him, as he could not come there for nothing, and his expensea were 31., and unless that sum, together with the 101., was paid he should at once take the table and other goods. The plaintiff said he would go out and try and get the money; but on his return he found the billiard-table, gasfittings, and other articles in a van, ready to be removed, and they were aU taken away, and were afterwards sold. This action was then brought for an unlawful conversion of the goods.
Mr. FRA.ccis, having opened the plaintiff's case, sdd the whole matter would resol,e itself into a point of law upon the construction of the assignment it being a question whether the defendant was justifie in takdng the goods until the expiration of the time for which the loan was made-namely, the 30th of Janury, 1858. He, therefore, suggested that the whole matter should be left to the learned judge.
Mr. ~erjennt THos agreed to this, vand the jury were The plaintiff was caUed to prove these facts, and he stated, in addition, that at the time the bill of sale was given it was understood that nothing was to be taken until after the expiration of 18 months from the time of the loan and the bil of sale being given. He afterwards saw the defendant, who said, as the plaintiff had not paid the 101., he was obliged to take the goods.
The goods were sold by auction for 41L 6e.; when the expenses were deducted, the amount was 381. 4a
The learned JuDGE said the whole question arose upon the construction of the bill of sale.
Mr. Serijeant T}IOAs said the bil of sale was an absolute assignaent of the goods ; the covenant to pay by instalmeents must be taken with the proviso for redemption upon payment of the money. The failure in payment of one instalment was an absoute breach of the covenant, and the whole was at an end, so that the power to redeem did not apply, and the goods were the absolute goods of the party to whom the goods were assuned.
Mr. FaRrcIs sai the truo construotion of the deed was that the goods were pledged until the 30th of January, 1868, and that the sale was subject to the proviso for redemption,
The learned JunDG said there ought, in his opinion, to be judgment for the plaintiff. The defendant might have brought an action on the covenant for nonpayment of the mstalment. The damages, in his opinion, should bo 601.

JOFES V. THIE PROVINCLAL ASSVRAWCE COMrPANY.
This wAs an action tried at Liverpool assizes on a policy of iunsuance- for 1,0001., granted by the defendants, andL a verdict was found for the plaintiff for this amount.
Mr. ATHERiTON, Q.C, now moved for a niew trial, on the ound of misdirection. The action was brought by th, Fones, the father, as administrator of J. P. Jones, the de. ceased, on a policy effected in the defendants office on the 28th of February, 1855. The deceaed died on the 4th of November, 1856. The policy contained a proviso that if any of the statements or allegations relating to the state of health of the dleceased at the time of effecting the policy should be untrue, or if the insurance had been obtained by any untrue averment whatsoever, then the policy should be void, and all the premiums paid to the company should be forfeited to the company. The deceased, after stating that he had never been afflicted with various complaints, stated,"l Iam now in good health, and do ordinarily enjoy good health." The pleas set up that at the time the deceased effected this pohicy he was aware of a disordler which he had which tended to shorten life; that he was not in a good sate of health, and did not ordinarily enjoy good health. The facts disclosed at the trial were, that the deceased's father was a flour dealer in Liverpool, and in 1851 the deceased became afflicted with dyspepsia and weakness of the stomach; his father was advised to take a farm for him after sending him a voyage for the benefit of his health. A farm was in consequence taken for him in Flintshire, where he resided afterwards. In 1853 he had a severe illness, and a still more severe one in 1854. The learned judge who tried the cause told the jury that, although the deceased must have known of his severe ilness of 1854 when he effected the policy, yet if in his own mind he treated it as a hght matter and not as material to be brought to the
knwedge of the defendants, then it wouldE not como within the conditions of the proviso. The learned counsel contended that this ruling was wrong, and referred to the case of "I Andern v. Fitzerald" (4th vol., House of Lords Cases, p.484), which decided that the truth of the answers given, and not their materiality, was the question, and con-
tede'dtat i was the bounden duty of the deceased to haen stated tht h hhad had the illUneses hehad suffered
from.

Mr. DoWrDsSwLL now moved to set asside that verdlck on the ground thatit was against the evidenee. It appeared that a projected bank, called the Westminster Bank of London, had promised the plaintiff, who was formerly a stock-broker and sometimes consulted by persons as to the best means of placing out their money, 501. for every person ho could induce to become a director of the bank. The p Iaintiff was consulted by General Bigno and had introducod the secretary of the bank to him, and, as a friend, had advised him to become a director, and in cons ence General Bignoll became a director, and the plaintiff sued the defendant as one of the projectors for his 501. A plea was placed on the record alleging fraud in his having thus procured General Bignoll as a director, in concealing from him that he was to have 601. for persuadin him asa &dis interested friend to give his name to the bank, But the jurv found a verdict on the plea generally for the plaintil

This it wasi admitted was a fatal defct, as the causte as not thereby legally determined; and it was proposed by the defendant's counsel that the Court should act upon the clause empowering them to send back the award in that event. One of the arbitratoor, however, had died slnce the award WaS made, but ats that case was provded for by the order and power given to the Court t appoint fresh srbitcator, it was seu est d that the Court would act upon that clause, though it appeared that the award, tschnically wrong as it might be, was iAn effect a proper one as the action was one of a triefng character and oght never to have been brought.

Mr. JA3=s submitted, at the conclusion of the plaintiff's case, that there was no evidenoe of negligence on the part of the defendants.
Mr. Baron W&TSON said that the case had better go to the jm
12r%erjeant PARRY summed up the plaintiff's case.
Mr. EDW- JAMES, in addreesing the jury on behalf of the defendants, said that he trusted that a verdict would not be returned against the company because it had beon originated in France, which had been urged as an argument against the defendants by the counsel for the plaintiff. It
ras stated that there was a large sheet of ice upon the step. If that had been the cAe, would not some of the other pa. sengers have met with a similar accident? Persons getting in and out of an omnLibus caused an aocumulation of mud upon the step which in wasm weather became peasy, and in frosty weather froze and became a lump of ice such as waI complained of. Surely the public could not expect the omnibuses to stp every few minutes for the purposo of having the steps cleaned, It Ws evident that the accident might have been avoided by the plaintiff; as it had been by the other pasengers if he had used due care in getting out. Under these circumstances, he contended that the verdict must be in favour of the defendants.
Mr. Baron WATSOme, in suamming up, said there were two questions for the jury to decide upon-first, was the omniBus in question the propery of the defendants?
The jury said they ieved that it was.
Mr, Baron WATSOI then said that the second question would be, was there any negligence on the prt of the defendants' servants? The company were biound to provide proper conveyances for the convemnence or the plic. It was clear that if there bad been the pieceo f Iceupor,theste when the omnibus started, and it had not been zemove, there would have been ross negligence on the part of the conductor; and even f it had accumulated from time to time from the feet of the passeugers and the conductor had neglected to swreepe it away, it wod be such neglect as would render the company liable. The jury must Say whether, in their opimon, the injury to the plaintiff~ was caused by his stepping upon the piece of ice on the step, and whether such piece of ice was left there negligently by the oompany's servants. If they found these quetons in favour of the plaintiff, they would.givehim such danages as they con. sidered would be afaircompensationfor the injuries and loss he had sutained.
The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff-damages 60Z.

ADIMALTY COURT, FIDAY. APRTr. 17
TIIE LE VATT.LA pM- T--I
(eforc Dr. LuSInTxnTn I
The Norw brig Idun andtheFrench shipLeVaiuant, the former ennnd the latterin balast, were brought to anchor in the Penarth-2r0ad, and remained there several days. On the 3d of Jan last a gala sprung up from the S.W., and at 8 p,m. onthe 4th the wind having shifted to the N., the vessel came into conhat. Tho brig charged the Le Vaillant, first with giving her a foul berth, and secondly with sheering asainst her; whereas the Le Vaillant alleged that the coUision arose from the brig driving against her. Cross actions were brought by the respective parties.
Dr. AnDDAMS and Dr. DANEz were heard for the IdunDr. BAYxoRD and Dr. TwIss for the Le Vaillant.
The RLDERBRXTHR by whom the Court was assisted, were of opinion that the LB Vaillant was solely to blame.
The Court pronounoed acoordingly.
TrA BEE-COLLrISxo.
This was a suit promoted by the flat Swan against the ship Bee, to reoover the loss arisng from a collsion between them in the river MHeey, opposite to the small landing stage at Liverpool, on the 26th of November last, at 9 am. The flat was oonveying coals to a steamer in the river; the Bee, in tow of a steanit, was proceeding from theQueen's Dock basin to the Sandon DockM The weather had been foggy, but, according to the Swan, it had cleared for a few m-inutes at the time of the coUision; the Bee, on the oontry, contended that it was very foggy, the foe having come on very suddenly. The Swan alleged that, observing
large screw steamer, the Anglo-Saxon, at anchor, in the way of her course, she let go her anchor. In about 20 minutes she descried the Bee and the steamtug, and on their arriving abreast the Anglo-Saxon they suddenly starboarded their helms, and struck the Swan so violent a blow that she sank in deep water, but had since been raised with great difficuty and expense. The Bee attributed the collision to the Swan improperly dropping her anchor, and thereby bringingup under her hawae.
Dr. Byfrd and Dr. Twi appeared for the Swan; Dr. Deane and Dr. Wamibey for te Bee.
The learned JuDG said that the Bee, having starboarded her helm, the onus rested upon her to justify that act; he therefore called upon the learned advocates for the Bee to open the case.
Dr. DxAxm and Dr. WArEY having addressed the Court,
The learned JUDG: without bearing counsel on the other side, said that the Elder Brethren and himself were clearly of opinion that the blame attached entirely to the Bee, and pronounced accordingly.

(Before the CHInW COISSIONER.)
This insolvent, who bad been a hipbroker at Hull, was opLoia by Mr. Denny and was supported by Mr. M'Oabrey.
T0e opposig creditor, a ooachmaker, complained that the insolvent had purchased a gig of him without any expectation of aying for it, as his circumstanoes at the time were hopelessly embarrassed. It was further cornplained that the inolvent had left Hull, where nearly alibis creditors residedc and hadometoLondon, where he had been arrested by a friond.
The CBXIF Comssom ordered the case to stand ad. ourned for further aocounts to be filed, and intimated his

3N RE ELISHA ARCHER.
This isolvent, a pianoforte maker, was opposed by Mr. Reed and was supported by Mir. Sleigh. The chief point in the case was an imputed fraud in a charge which the insolvent had made upon his property in favour of a man named Morrison on account of an alleged loan of 801. The Insolvent, Morrison, and the wife were separately examined, snd all swore to the advano at different timer of various sums, amounting in the aggregate to SOl., bht upon crossexamnation they differed maaterially in their accounts of the circumstances aitending each advance.
The learned CO1IMussrox expressed his utter disbelief of the exi e of any such debt to Morrison as had been alleged, and pierefore the c l ihis favoar was a fraud. The insolvenj would be discharged at the expiration of six months from the vesting order.

William Brooks.-I uan a cab-driver, and know the wiess Denond, whom I drove about 10 months ago or thereabouts toCuter-street, Houndsditch. He had two bags in the cab full of something, but I did not see what they contained. They were put into a house on the left. band Fide, about the middle of the street. As far as I can recollect, the woman who lived with Dermond as his wife was with us. I was taken off the and in the Moncriea, and went to Hooper-square. I do not know who put the bags into the cab. Desmond paid me 3s. 6d,, which was less than I ought to have had, as I waited nearly two hours in Hooper-squar I saw some men whom I did not know at Hooper-square but no women.
Crossexaminel-I was fetched here by some man fromn this court, but I do not know his name. I saw Desmond last night. He asked me if I remembered going witk him to Hooper-square, and I said "Yes." I do not remember moving any goods at any other time for Desmond, I never removed any waterftight boots for him to my own residence, nor to the Crescent. I have known him for two or three years, but only as being in Mr. Moses's servioe.
By fr. Downing,-I never to my knowledge saw tile prl. soner Reynolds before.
By Mr. LewLis-Until I was fetched here I spoke to no one on the subject.
Francis Maybury, licensed carmxn, Biliter-street.-The prioner Maybury is my son, and has aesisted me in m

This witness expressed his fers that he migh' be injured in his business by the reports which bad appeared in the newspapers, an impression had probably been produced among merchants that he, and not his son, was the person cbarged; but Mr. Lewis and the Lord Mayor both acquitted him of all blame in the matter, and intimated their belief that he was too weD known in his business to be prejudiced by anything that had transired.
Ann Woods-I live with Mrs. Wild, in Christopher. court, Whitechapd. I remember seeing two boxes standing agnst the wall m the court last summer, but I cannot say exactly at what time. They were white boxes about three feet long. They remained there about 25 minutes- but I do not know who brought them there, nor who took them away. I know none of the prisoners
John Campbell, Jones-buildings, Whiterhapel-The wit. ness Campp belwho was examined the othTx day is my wife.

Robert Cox.-I am mate of the ship Mary rnne, now lying in the St. Katharine Docks. I remember on the Ist of April, 1856, receiving packages to go to Port Adelude. They were numbered from "1,088" to "1,093." They were covered tranks, and marked on the top " G," and on the side" C C." We conveyed them to Adelaide, where three of them were opened in my presace I ca

Mr. Lewis.-But no boots and shoes, I suppose.
Witness.-Yes; there was one boot-& very old one. (Lraughter.) TAhe contents of the boxes could nothave been changed on the voyage The three oases owhich I did not see opened were left at the merchant's warehouse. We did notburing any of the cases back with us, nor any of the
Bdward Rogers, Custom-house officer.-A box is now in thQueen's warehouse which came by land carrie from IAverpool with the Customs' se on it. I asited at its openingt and found in it nothing but ashes and such rub I was present when Mr. Isenberg saw that box.
Hidebrand Hadfield, foreman to the St Katharine's Dock Compan ,re-examined.-I received the goods mentioned in the sipping note produced on the 28th of March. I had them placed on the quay, where they remained until the lst of April, when they were shipped on board the Mary Annee,hvig previously been in charge of a watch. man and a constable.
Mr. Lewis then applied for a remand, contending that he was justified in doing so by the evidence in the case of all th rIsoners, with the exception, perhaps, of the wrman
The Lol:D MAros.-I do not see anything to affect the prisoner Collins.
Mr. Lewis.-Where is a doubt I should offer no opposition to ball; and the officer Hayton can tell your Lord. shRi that he will be able on a future day to produce further evience of an important character, and probably a portion of the stolen property.
The LORD MA.O.-Well, we will hear what the offioer has to say.
Hayton,S 688, was then sworn and said,-From the information I have received within the last day or two I shall be able to bring further evidenoe.
The LoRDMAYOil-Does it relate to one of the prisoners, or to all?!
Witness-To all.
Mr. Lowiq.-And do yon think you will be able to produce some of the stolen goods? Witness.-I do,
By Mr. Humphery.-I received the information I refer to last night.
Mr. Downing contended that Reynolds was entitled to his dischare, as the only witness called in his case to corroborate the evidence of Desmond knew nothing, except that he took two sacks of something to a house in Cutler-street, without any attempt havin been made to show that it was the house in which Reynolds lodged.
M'Carthy.-And there's no evidence against me, except that of Desmond, who, as I told you the other day, had something to do about a snuffbox and a telescope with that policeman.
Mr. Steadman.-Yes; there's something in that, I think, which ought to be considered.
lMr. Lewis.-I submit to your Lordship if it is fair to make these observations. If there was anything in this affair of the telescope and snuffbox some one must know something about it.
The LOBDX MAyoR-I believe that some one does know something about them-and some one in this court, too.
Mr. Steadmmn-Yes; there (pointing to Hayton) stands the receiver, and (pointing to e'Carthy) there stands the thief.
M'Carthy.-I hope your Lordship will take bail for me? The LORD hYo,o-Yes I will take bail for you alL Aftera few iinutee' deliberation with Mr. Goodman,
The LORD MYos. discharged the two women, but told them their presenoe would be expected at the next examination of the_other prisonear, who were remanded for a week, Reynolds and M'Carthy upon their own security, and the others with liberty to put in bail themselves in 501, and one security each in the same amount.
Bail for Maybury was at once tendered and accepted, but Collins, Boyce, and Pickering were required to give 24 hours' notice.

A NEW POISON.-M. de Luca has just communi-
A NEW 3'oIsox.-M. de Luca has just commaunieated to the Academy of Soiences the discovery of the poisonons principle of the.ryclamen Europxeum, or common .sowbread. This tuberculous plant has long been used in imedicine as a violent purgative, and externally as a re'solvent and a remedy for the ear-ache ; but it was
-mot known that it contained a powerful poison, pro.ducing effects not unlike those of the curara, which the Iudians of -the Rio .:Negro use to poison their arrows with. M - do Luca obtains it by digesting the aroot for 45 days in alcohol, then pounding the root, digesting it again -in a fresh quantity of alcohol, an;i repeating this process until the pulp had lost its acrid taste. All the tinctures thus obtained are tien left to spontaneous evaporation in a cellar. At the end of about 40 -days a whitish sulbstance is deDosited, which, a&ter being repeatedly washed in boiling alcohol, is left to dry .in the dark. The cyclamine, or vegetable base of the cyclamen, thus produced is white, opaque, and brittle, and enmits no particular smtell; it absorbs the hlumidity of tbe air,-becomes transparent and gelatinous in water, and ass rues a dark colour when exposed to the action of light. It 'is a cnrious fact that, while pigs can eat..ny quantity of thoroot with impunity, not only the aetive principle itself, *but even the natural juice of the roo,t, acts as a poison on small fish, if mixed with the water in wIich thoy are in-the proportion of I to 3,000. Four graLames of the juiee injected into the tracbh:a of a rabbit causee it to die in osevulsions in the conuse of ten minutes. Bromine appears to be an antidote to this poison, or at least to mlig-ate its effect econsiderably ; it has the same neutra. lizing,ower over theourara.poison.

The Kidderminster Riots.
.BE IDDIRMINSTER RIOTS.
KIDDERMINSTER, APRIL 17.
The adjourned examination of the parties charged with being implicated in the riots at th blate election for this borough and in the savage attack upon the Right Eon. Robert Love tcok place to-day at the Town-hall, amid a renewal of the excitement which has attended this inquiry throughu,a. It will be remembered that at the lut examination on Saturday, reported in Thc Times of last Monday, 27 persons were *haged with being concerned inthe riot, and that, no evidence being offered in reference to six of them, they were discharged. The following were remanded to this day, and now appeared to answer the charge, viz.:Mr. Alfred Talbot, gentleman; Mr. Renry Chellingworth, gentleman; Mr. W. Pitt, butcher; Mr. B. Wellings, Robert Westwood, Henry Westwood, William Wood, George Barker, Albert Perrins, John Cook, George Parker, Samuel Payne, and Benjamin Potter.
Mr. Kettle appeared again to conduct the prosecution; Mr. Huddleston and Mr. Byrne (all of the Oxford Circuit) appearing for the accused.
Mr. Kx'Lr stated that since the last examination some otber evidence had been communicated to him on the part of the prosecution which he wished to offer., He accordingly called
Mr. Ceurzon, who deposed that he was in conversation with Mr. G. A. Bird, attorney, at about a quarter past 4 o'clock on the day of the polling at Blakebrook, and saw Mr. Alfred Talbotin the crowd. He said, "Well Bird, will you try again after this ?" Mr. Bird observed that he appeared to glory in it. Mr. Talbot seemed to glory in it, and sad, " I told James Pardoe they'll put him in the river if he gets to the bridge;" he added, "they'll put both of them in the river." Mr. Talbot afterwards went among the crowd.
Witness went another way to the town across the fields, and, therefore did not see Mr. Lowe and his party go along the road to Mr. Shephard's; but saw him leave to go towards the town.
Mr. G. A. Bird, attorney, of Kidderminster, corroborated Mr. Curzon's statement. When Mr. A. Talbot came up he asked witness whether he would try again. There had been some stonethrowing then. Mr. Talbot said, " I've done what I can to prevent this ;" and he added that Mr. Pardoe had insulted him, aud he would do no more. He also said, "I know what they intend to do. When they get to the town-bridge they mean to pitch James Pardoe and Mr. Low%into the river." Witness said to him, "Well, You are a nice fellow; you seem to be rojoicing at it ;" and he afterwards said, "Do you think Lowe will ever show his face again 'p" Witness did not see where Mr. Alfred Talbot went.
On cross-examination witness said, he was one of Mr. Lowe's party. Did not remember Mr. A. Talbot telling him that he had offered Mr. J. Pardoe to accompany Mr. Lowe and his friends to the town.
Mr. Woodward, capet manufacturer, deposed that he saw Mr. A. Talbot, and asked him where his brother, Mr. Pemberton Talbot, was. (Mr. P. Talbot is a friend of Mr. Lowe's.) Mr. A. Talbot said he had requested him not to be present. He also said, " It looks as if there'd be a little rough work before it is done."
Cross-examined.-Anybody could see there was likely to be some rough work. Heard the Mayor appeal to Mr. A Talbot to address the people. Heard him tell the people to
home and not throw stones, and thought he meant what
WiUliam Holloway, a labouring man, said, he was at the booth. Heard Mr. A. Talbot address the people, and afterwards saw him in the crowd. The people said, '-Mr. Talbot for ever !" and he answered, "Go a-head, boys !" Stones were thrown after that. This was hofore Mr. Lowe left the booth.
Eliza Johnson, married woman, was on the bank opposite the Rev. Mr. Shephard's house, with Ellen and Eliza Lee, when Mr. Lowe and his party got into Mr. Shephard's house. Saw the stones being thrown in all directions. They came over her head from behind. Eliza Lee said she was frightened, and Mr. Chellingworth said they need not be frightened, as they would neither hurt her nor him if they kept out of the way.
Cross-examined.-Mr. Chellingworth came out of the road on to the bank, apparently to be out of the way. Did not hear Mr. Chellingworth say, " Let them all have a taste of it." Should have heard him if he had. If he had remained in the road he would have been in the thick of it. Did not see Mr. Chellingworth take any part in the row.
Hannah Sylvester proved that she saw Mr. CheUingworth standng opposite Mr. Shephard's house, where Mr. Lowe and his party took refuge.
James Mayer, labourer, deposed that he saw Mr. Alfred Talbot address the people. He mid :-" Now, lads, don't throw any stones, for although we are beaten we are not forsaken." Some stones were then thrown into the booth. The witness also deposed to seeing Mr. CheUingworth opposite Mlr. Shephard's gate, and heard him say: -" He's got enough. He won't come again." Witness did not know what they were talking about.
Mr. George Gwynn Brown, surgeon, of Stourport, deposed that he was at the hustings about 4 o'clock on the evening of the poll, and saw Mr. Alfred Talbot there. Mr. Talbot said the mob was very mueh excited, and that we must take care of ourselves. He said there would be a row. Some stones were then thrown by the mob.
Cross-examined.-It required no divination to perceive that there would be a row; in fact, there was a row already.
This closed the case for the prosecution.
The magistrates thenretired for a fewminutes. On their return,
The MAYoR (Mr. Kiteley) said, they had considered the evidence as agamst Mr. Henry Chellingworth, and had come to the decision-which was an unanimous one-that there was no ovidence against him
Mr. CheUingworth was therefore discharged.
After some argument as to the course to be pursued, the depositions of all the witnesses for the prosecution were read over.
Mr. HUDDLESTON then addressed tho Bench on be half of the accused. He denied the inginuation which had been thrown out, that this was an organized. plot-an organized attack-of 6,000 or 7,000 persons upon Mr. Lowe and his party. It was a fact, unhappily, that in Kidderrainster since the borough was enfranchised, and probably before, there had not been that sympathy between master and man which was desirable, and the consequence was that at electionsin Kiddermiuster the non-electors commonly had a popular candidate who was opposed to the candidate put forward by the masters and electors. He denied that there was any organized plot; if there had been, the proceedings of 6,000 or 7,000 persons musthave had a muchs more disastrous result. Ho expressed the regret of himself and the friends of Mr. Boycott that such violence should have been exercised towards Mr. Lowe, and repudiated all insinuations of previous concert. Ee would not offer any evidenoe in answer to that given for the prosecution with regard to the men who had been seen throwing stones; it was right that they should be required to answer for it elsewhere; but with reference to the case of Mr. Talbot he would rnaintain that there was not a tittle of legal evidence against him. It had been suggested that Mr. ralbot, in addressing the mob and caUing on them not to throw stones, spoke ironically, and that his appear ance on the liustings was the preconcerted signal for the attack. He denied this in toto. The fact was, as had only that morning been proved by Mr. Woodward, that the Mayor himself Mad requested Mr. Talbot to address the mob in order to calm their excitement. Mr. Huddleston then called the following witnesses:
Edwin Tudor, cooper, was at the Black Horse at half-past 3 on the day of the polling. There were a number of persons these. Went to the polling booth after he had met them. About 50 persons came out of the Black Horse to go to the poll. Mr. Boycott and Mr. Talbot went with them to the booth. Heard Mr. A. Talbot say, as they were going along, "This won't do, lada; throw those sticks away." Took a stick from a boy and threw it away himself. Did not hear any language of an exciting nature from Mr. Talbot. Stones were thrown when they got into the booth. When he got to the booth he heard some one say, 'Mr. Talbot, try and stop this." He assisted Mr. Talbot into the booth, and heard him say, " Don't throw an y stones."1
Oross-examined.-Some persons had sticks. About a dozen sticks were thrown away into a field before they reached the polling booth. Saw Mr. Talbot leave the booth, but did not now where he went to. There was a shower of stones came into the booth while witness was there. Mr. Talbot appeared anxious to protect, and as if lie disapproved the proceedings of the crowd.
Mr. George Hooman, of the firm of Pardoe and Hooman, carpet manufacturers.-Heard Mr. Talbot offer to aocompany Mr. Lowe from the polling booth. There was a good
eal of stone-throwing, and witnoss was struck on the side of the head with a, stone. Mr. Talbot remhrked-" Mr. Lowe had betterego down with me and Mlr. Boycott to the town" He appeared anxious to protect himi. Witnes
endeavoured to communicate to Mr. Pardoe what Mr., Tralbot had said, but was not sure-that Mr. Pardee understood-it. Was one of Mr. Lowe's mspporters.
-Cross-examined.-Mr. Talbot appeared to have some in-: fluneoe h epe n nevue to restrain them.
Th aitae eortrdtoce-uto h oeon
Benjamin Wellings, .obert Westwood, Henry West. wood, William Wood, George Barker. Albert Perrins, john Cook, -Samuel Payne, George Parker, and Benjamin Potter, for rioting at the hustinps, were committed for trial at the assizes. Bail was accepted for their appearance.

This closed the proceedings.

MILITARY AND NAVAL INTELLIGRECE.
The sailing transport Xooresfort, at Woolwich Arsenal, hs shipped three complete batteries of Artillery, a large quantity of reserve stores, and the greater portion of the baggage belonging to the troops ordered to take passage on board that vessel for China. The shipment of the baggage will be completed to-day, and the troops v'ill embark from the pier at 2 o'clock p.m. They consist of two full comp&niesof the 13th battaion RoyAl Artillery-namely,Captain Longden and Captain Middleton's companies. LieutenantColonel W. T. Crawford, 13th battalion, 'who is appointed to the chief command of the Royal Artillery in China, takes passage in the Mooresfort,'with Commissary-General Young, C.B., and Dr. Pickett, of the transport department.
The Royal Marine Artillery being below its required establishment, an order has been issued from the Admiralty for volunteering to be opened from the Royal Marine Light Infantry companies. The qualifications required of volunteer are that they be not less than 5 feet 8 inches in height, of good conduct, and general intelligence. On the order being announced at Chatham yesterday, .10 men belonging to that division immediately volunteered, and as soon as they have been approved by the Admiralty they will be handed over to Captain W. P. Draffen, Marine Artillery, who has been sent from Portsmouth to take the oommand of the volunteers.
The new heavy.class steam-frigats Diadem, 32, is nearly ready for trial of her machinery; she got up steam in her boilers on Thursday in the basin at Portsmouth.
The Blenheim, 60, depot ship of the steam reserve in Portsmouth harbour, Captain the Hon. F. T. Pelham, C.B., has moved from her moorings at the north part of the dockyard to Gosport side, out of the way of the ran of the slp from which the Royal Sovereign screw three-decker is to be launched this day week.
Mr. Grant, the Controller-General of Victualling, visited Portsmouth yesterday, and transacted business connected with his department.
The ward-room officers of Her Majesty's ship Excellent gave a complimentary dinner on board on Thursday, in honour of Mr. Charles Stark, on his retizing from the position of mathematical instructor after a period of 25 years' service on board that ship, during which time he has instructed nearly 400 officers in the mathematical branch of the gunnery course. His total service in the navy mounts to a period of 39 years.
The Scorpion, 6, Master-Commander J. Parsons, which was paid off at Chatham yesterday, has been in commission nrly four years, having sailed from Plymouth in 1853. Dnring the whole of that period she has been stationed in the West Indies, where she was employed as surveying vessel, principally off the northern coast of South America, Carthagena Bay, St. Lucie, St. Thomas's, Santa Cruz, Cuba, and Bermuda. While surveying off the northern coast of Cuba the Scorpion discovered a large Spanish vessel of 1,000 tons, called the Primera de Catuluna, on shore on a reef, and a total wreck. The vessel was bound from BarcelonA for New Orleans ; and the Scorpion, after great difficulty succeded in rescuing the whole of the passengers and crew and landing them at Havannah. On arriving at Bermuda Commander J. Parsons left the vessel for the purpose of continuing his surveying duties, when the command of the ship devolved on the master, Mr. J. P. Dillon. The Scorpion left at Bermuda the Nile, 91, screw steamer, Captain G. P Mundy. During the time she has been in coin-

The Late Fatal Accident In Russell-Place, Bow-Street, Covent-Garden.
THE LATE FATAL ACCIDEN' IN RUSSELL.
PLACE, BOWV-STREET, COVENT-GARDBR.
Mr. Bedford, the coroner for Westminster, resumed the inquest yesterday afternoon at Kling's College Hospital on the body of Maurice Fitzgibbon, a bricklayer's labourer, who was killed on the morning of Good Friday last by the faUing of a wall in Russell-place, Bow-street, on which occa. sion three other men were seriously injured, one of whom, John Shehan, a plasterer, has since died.
Mir. Philp, solicitor, attended to watch the proceedings on behalf of the widow gof Shehan; and Mr. Lewis, of Ely. place, appeared for Mr. Howse, the builder, who was em. ployed by Mr. Parker, architect of the Duke of Bedford, the landlord,!to pull down the buildings in the court; which his Grace was induced to do in order to remove an intolerable nuisance in the neighbourhood, the houses having for a long time past been wholy eccupied by prostitutes an other persons of a most disreputable character.
The jury were resworn for the purpose of continuing the inquiry as to the cause of both the deaths, and after the body of Shehan bad been viewed and identified,
Mr. John Manley, of No. 3, May's-buildings, Bedfordbury, plasterer, was examined. He stated that he knew John Shehan, the deceased. He was eng-..ed in plaster ing the waU wbich fell on Good Friday. He saw tLe accident, and assisted in picking Sheban up out of the rains of the waiL Thepolicebrought stretchers andtook him away. Shehan was standing on a pair of tressels, getting the wall ready for plastering.
The coroner said he had received a joint Report from ir. Parker and Mr. Hakewill, the district surveyor, which he would request Mr. Hakewill to read.
Mr. Hakewill then read the foilowing report:-
"We theunereluedhain made a very caref el examnination of the wall and premi'eo intuRsilpiaoe, the scene of the accident, we

" The five houses In the court hlad been entirely remnoved to the level of the ground floor, leaving only the front and party walls of the basement foor with the timbers and joiats of the ground floor, leaving aLe0 the whole of the back wall, the fall of which is the subject of this
We etnesured the ack wll in question. It was 70 feet lng and
25 feet high from the ground floor to the too, and 7 feet 6 inches from the basement to the groxnd fIloor, making tbe total height 32 feet

The four partitionL wells of the houses (whlch had been taken down) had been huUt in and Incorporated with the wall In qusestion. They therefore contributed to the stability of the structure, and their removal must, consequently, have weakened it; for it wil be seen that this walul of the size and dimensions asove given) was standing 'without later'al uptorts.

Ur. Hakewill, in answer to questions by the coroner, said the immediate cause of the wall faling was the decay of a piece of bond-timber at the base of the wall, lea i the wall standling on only half its thickness, the brickso0
being l8 inches; a few courses above the mortar being perished and filled with living animals. Had the timber re.nained sound the wall in all human probability would have stood. The decay of the timber was not discoverable, except by opening the ground and laying bare a portion of the walL e should certainly have plaeed temporary shores or have left a part of the party waU standing; but he thought it likely that the actual state of the case, as discovered by the subsequent survey, would have been passed over. On that account he had left a portion of the wall still standing, that the jury might
able to judge for themselves how unlikely it would be to suspect any such cause of accident to exist. The materias of theohouses were very ancient. He should think from the style of the building that the wall had been up 200 years. There could be no question that a survey ought to have been made on both sides of the wall before any work was commenced upon it; and the wall ought to have been shored up.
Mr. Lewis.-Do you think it necessary to shore where a Wall is apparently sound?
itness.-As a precautionary measure it would be better to do so.
Mr. Parker was re-sworn, and in addition to his former evidence, which was read over to him, said that the cause of weakness in the wall was entirel;r hidden from the eye, o that a survey oould not have discovered it. They must have cut into the wall to have detected it.
BJ Mr. Lewis.-Mr. Howse was employed by him (Mr. Parker) to pull down the houses in the court for the Duke of Bedford. Mr. Howse had no interest whatever in the premises.
Mr. Way, house-surgeon of the hospital, was then exAiined. He stated that he had made a peal mortcre examination of the body of Maurice Fitzgib6on. There were three lacerated scalp wo uds, but no fracture of the skaull or injury of the brain. The lunps were very much gorged with blood as in cases of suffocation. The heart was empty, owing to tse violent manner by which the deceased
dmet his. eath. Witne.s had no doubt that the deoeased had died from suffocation. The other injured man (Shehan) had his leg and thigh broken, as also the bones of the nose. The thiga was amputated by Mr. Ferguson the same evening, and the deceased at first went on well, but on the following Wednesday he commenoed sinking rapidly, and died about 1 o'clock in the day. Ths cause of death was exhaustion from the injury to the amputated limb. Had the limb not been amputated he would not have lived so long.
Henry Guy said he oocupied premaises nt the back of the wall which had fallen down, and that about half-past 5 o'clock on the morning of Good Friday a person named Scott told him that some rubbish was coming into his premis
and witness then saw the wall give way and fall. He was about three feet from the wall when it fell. He saw three persons taken out of the rubbish. The whole of the wall fell together in one body.
Mr. William Howse was re-examined.-IHe stated that he was a builder, and was employed by Mr. Parker to take down the buildings and to get rid of the old materials. The removal of the buildings was under his superintendence. He considered it was safe for the wall to stand. The roof of the stable did not bear on the walL He was at the pre. mises at half-past 9 o'clock on the morning of the day before, and he then considered that the wall would stand without support. The wall was 9 inches thick, 25 feet high, and 70 feet long. The wall was unattached on all sides from the ground floor. He did not see poor Shehan. He had been removed. He was in attendance every day, and had seen no danger. Had the wall fallen the day before it must have faUen upon him. The expense of shoring up the waU would have been paid by the Duke of Bedford, and he himself would have had a profit out of it. There was no contract for the work.
John Wheldon, 4, Paternoster-row, bookseUer, said that, about 24 years ago, he resided in Russell-place, about which time a fire occurred in the range of stabling which adjoined the wall, and it reached the wal itself. After the fire was extinguished he saw smoke coming out of the wall, when a personJresentwith a crowbar took out a large piece of burt 'mbrC from the walL He could not prove anything further, but he thought the inference might fairly be drawn-
The Coroner.-The inference wil be drawn by the jury. At the same time I think yon have done quite right, knowing this fact, in coming forward and stating it to the
John Mills MichelL inspector of police, said that at halfpast 10 o'dock on Good Friday morning he was at Bowstreet polioe-station, when he was informed that some buildings had fllen down in RusseU-place. He wentthere, and saw the deceased, John Shehan, lying in a helpless state. Tbe bone of his left leg was obtruding at the knee. There was no portion of the wall upon him at the time. He assisted in taking him to the hospitaL Witness asked him how many men were employed on the works, when he said there were four, and as only three had been seen he pointed out where the fourth was likely to be found, and Maurice Fitzgibbon was afterwards found at the place so pointed out by Shehan.
This being the whole of the evidence,
Mr. Lewis asked permission to address a few observations tothejury; but
The Coroner said it was contrary to the rule of that court to allow counsel to address the jury where the inquiry was merely preliminary, and he was of opinion that the jury were quite competent to come to a just conclusion without the assistanoe of Mr. Lewis. The jury had to consider one single point only-namely, had the deceased, or either of them, come to their or his death by the negligence of any other person ? It was necessary in order to support that charge that the jury shouldtake into consideration aU the surrounding circumstances. The question was whether Mr. Howse was criminally responsible for what had happened. The property in question belonged to the Duke of Bedford, who had ordered it to be removednot because the buildings were dilapidated, but because they were occupied by prostitutes. Mr. Parker, architect to the Duke, employed Mr. Howseto puUl down the housesaudhere he (the coroner) could not help expressing his regrec that this matter should have been entrusted to Mr. Hlowse in a case where an architect was employed by the Duke of Bedford. If Mr. Parker had paid a visit to Russell-court from time to time he would have known what was going to be done, and he would have seen while the femoltion of the buildings was taking place whether any support of the waU was required or not. He therefore much regretted that the whole of the responsibility should have been cast upon Mr. Howse. There could be no doubt that the faUing of the wall had been produced by the means stated in the joint report of the architect and district surveyor. and that the deaths were caused-one by suffocation, and the other by the severe shock occasioned by the injury received. The jury would say whether they considered Mr. Howse to be criminally guilty of negligence; if so, they must hold him responsible for all that happened. Mr. Hakewil stated, in us former examination, that it was not his duty as the district surveyor to Inspect this property with a view to the safety of the public, beause it was a case of pulling down buildings, and that it was only his duty to make an inspection when it was a case of building up premises. He very much regretted to hear this distinction drawn, because it appeared to him that as many evils were likely to arise from the puUing down of buildings as could happen from the building of them up. It had been the habit of juries to return a verdict of "Accidental death" whenever the evidence feU short of a criminal charge. That might have beeR a very harmless course as the law formerly stood, but since other remedies were afforded to the friends of the deceased by proceedings in another court, he tbought it possible that in some eases a verdict of accidental death might be improperly used as a plea against any subsequent proceedings ,y the relatives of the des. Therefore he would suggest, if the jury felt that, although there might not attach any criminal responsibility to any person, yet, if it appeared to them that something had been omitted to be done which ought to have been done, they might steer a middle course, and, instead of returning a verdict of accidental death, they might say that the deceased came to their death by such and such means, caused by such and such circumnstances. Thus the parties would be left free to take whatever other course they might think proper to adont.
The jury then retired to consider their verdict, and after being absent about three-quarters of an hour they returned and delivered in the following verdict :-"That the deceased, Maurice Fitzbbon and John Shehan, came to their deaths by the fa=bng of a wall, some portion of which being in an unsound state, not exterally visible; yet they are of opinion, through an error of judgment, sufficient precaution was not taken to secure the same.
The Coroner.-A very proper conclusion, as far as My humble judgment goes. Gentlemen, you could not do otherwise. Ilt is a very serious question at all times when walls fall down, and one of the advantages of these inquiries is to expose the errors of men engaged in this sort of employment, and thereby prevent the occurrence of similar calamities.
Mr. Philp.-In this case of poor Shehan, a widow and sLx children are left whoUy unprovided for.
The Coronor.-Aye, there is the evil. Buthow hap ned it that the police did not look to the state of these buildings ?
Inspector Michel said that the court, being private property, had been closed at both ends by the Duke of Bedford's agents, and the policecould not have entered it without cemmeitting a tresspass.
The return to the inquisition was then signed by the jury, end the proceedings terminated.
