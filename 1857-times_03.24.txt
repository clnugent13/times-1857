Gentlemen, -The Members of the Committee who lately acted In concert on behalt of the Sharebelders to bring about a dissolution of the Company, are willing to assist agin In the protection of the Shareholders, by an examination of the accounis, and resitiung sucha Items as may appear unJustiliable. Before, however, they en;age in the inquiry, they are desirous of ascertaining the views and wishes of the Shareholders opposed to the proceedings of the Directors, and to molicit their support.
A request by one of the scrutineers for a lis of the names of the Propreters, and the number of votes each polled aLt the meeting h"eld on th lth ixet., has been retused- I is verTy desirable that the.Com. mittee thould ascertain from the Ahareholders who gave their prexies to the Directre whether such proxies were duly employed in voting against the amendmenit, viz, an examiation of the, accounts.
I remain, Gentlemen, your obedient servant,

To the ELgEWoTRj ot the SOUTHERN DIVICON of the l Gentlemen , of STAFFORD.
AVING thbi day been selected by a large and most H influential body of tbe Liberal interest to become a candidate In onjiunction With M,r. W. MatheWS, I hasten to solicit your suffrAgee at the approaching Election.
I offer nmselt to your notioe as a stanch supporter of civil and reUSioua liberty.
I am an advocate for an extension of the suffrage, and a supporter of thehballt.
I am In favour of the total abolition ot church-rates.
refrence to the present Government, and the question on which arliament has been dissolved, I wish to remark that Lord Palmersten took the bo at a time when otbers shrunk from it. and carried un triumnphantly to the conclusion or a war Into which the country seemed to have "helplessly drifted:" and beleving tho present Prime
Minister to possess, in an eminent degree, the neh-merited oonfidence
enation, I shall not hesitate to gve to hi Government a cordial. though wholly lne.ependent, r 2pport.
The numnerous and important interests of this ditict, in the prospeity of which I a personally eonremned, shall receive moyconstant
cre and support; and in these matiers I hopae, an one of your representatihlvese, to avail mnyself of the experience of mny frlend Mr. W.
Ibelieve my opinions wMi be found in unison with those of the majority of the elector: and bout4vu do me the honour of electing me, rmy time sbaU bedevotedtoyour iterests, and by oonstant attention t' my public duties I will endeavour to render myself worthy of the h4ghest honour to which an Enghlhman can asoire, namely, to represent his natlve county in Parliment.

To the XLECTORS of SOUTH STArFPORDSBIRE. Gentleren,
ALarge and influential numnber of the Liberal electors
have done me the honour to request that I wDI all 'ow myself to be put in nomination ss a candidate for this division of the county at the approaohing General EIection.
A regtry of upwards of ,1p00o TOv signficantly points to the fact, that, In aiL future etocttone for South Itaffsrdsbire, thevoice of the industrial portion of this peat community must have weight in the choice of its members; and that the electors are prepared to aert the principle that from among the productive clas one rat least of its representatives must be chosen.
It is on this ground that I have been induced to respond to the flattering and pressing invitation which bau been made to me.
If a long and intimate oonuexion and an extensive acquaintanoe with the tndustrid pursuits, together with an ctive participation in the Daiblic business of this great and Important ditrict, constitute a qualification for the discharge of the grave duties which attatch to your Representative, I venture to ho I maybe found not wholly untfitted for the office. At tho mems ttme I cannot conceal from myself the fact that the edficient discharge of those duties demands maore of strength and activity than I can hripe for any long period to enjoy.
To my optnious I need hardly refer. A Liberal-in the large and generous sense of the term -Ibave for many years idontified myself extensively with the great political movements of tbe Midland district. and before the election abundant opportunity will be afforded me of
Thoe nd explaining m ay views Indetail

flAYING been invited by a considerable portion of JJ. the influential electors in the coanty to offer myself as a Oandidate for the honour of representing you in Parliament. I do not hesitate to ask for your suffrages at the approaching election.
The broad ground on which I rest my appeal la that of faithfully represntig te vewsandprinciples cf the lAberal party, and sympathieingcordiallywitsh tnhe progrese of civit and religieos liberty.
I share what Is maniestly the general feeling of regret throughout the rontry, that Lord PalmerBton has been driven to a premature diolutionof Pariamentbytan unnatural combination of parties. It
Is1my convcin that he is entitled to the gratitude of the peple of England for htsv ciross and efficient Administration.
It would bo my ere, if elected, to proemote such measures as may tend to the improvement of our sodal system, especially by the enlrement of the oonstituency and the advancement of education.
To an Administration that would strenuously exertthemselvesfor the settlement of the church rate question, I would give my hearty
siith'a dnoere attachment to the Church of England, and to those grat Prostestant principles established at the Reformation, I would gladly oee erased rom the Statute liook all clidisabilities on account of religious belief.
It is hardly necessary to say, that I should support a well considered economy i x every department of the State, aan such reforms in our
civil and military serrie as recent circumstances have shown to be

Gentlemen
ibon nvited by influential gentlemen HAVIN4 with on e Uthe Borongh to ofter myself as a candidate, at
the approaching election, for the high honour of representing you tn the Etouse of Comlmons. I hasten to announce my acceptance of this Inviettion and to inform vou that I shal have the pleasure of paying my prsonl repect toevery electoir with the least possible delay, for the purpose of solicitig theirsauifrages and support on the day of
Mattersofbusiness havealready brouhtme, In some measure, into ounexiotn with your port; and I, 1therefore, do not appear among you
I apprehend that you will not roupider It an objection that I have been for some years, and stil am, actIvely egageg a a ipower and
lam a sincere mnemaber of the Church of ERuland and opposed to all further concessions to Popery. It is imposasible to estimate how large a portion of oUn civil and relgious libeIrties we owe to the glorious Reformation which freed us from the trammels of a Church which stifles al free discussion and toleration. At the same time I will sup-
Port almeaurisM calculated to advance the interest of true religion and sound education as regaros all nlasees. whether of my own communionx or of those who conscientiously dissent therefrom.
It will bemy earet endeavour to further every measure adapted to maintain and advance the boet interestesof the country, whether at
home or abroad. Iam in favour of eonomy in ouirnublircestablishments, but I wHilt ot coneet to measues which will diminish their real efficiency or'endanger the credit of the country, oni which our wholeocommercial prosperity rests. I believe much may be donsein this respect, whichb, while it leaLves our resources unimpaired, will afford a sensible relief of taxation.
~Wbats-er ma.y have been the orign of the existing state of things In C$hina, therecan be no doubt that tte honour of the Eglish flag must he firmly upheld. The dignity of this gret country mutt net ho lowered, nor the LlTea and property of our absecntoDuntrymen ieopardined; and,hliowever anxious I may be to secure the blessings of peace, It is,iniml opniWon, imnpossble new to recede.

a_rea giovean account of mystewardship,andlIagain offer myself asacandidate for the repre-sentation of South Wilts.
The first two years of the present Parlimenkt witnessed the succesful prosecution of great legislative and fisca reforms.
In the colonies dceeprooted disoontente were wisely allayed. To India guarantees were given for an improved sytem of government : whllo pablic employment was for thae first time thrown open to mnerit and ability, irrespoectve of political or personal favour.

In W14 we declared waLr with Rusas,iaan antaconist gigantrc in her power,but,who,.abusingbher strength,sought byin aggressive policy to
Ovrbear a weak and semi-barbarous State ; It was a war at once just, politic. and ncsay It was marked at Its coammencement byasre
ofvictories such as have seldom, If ever, illustrated the first campaigns 01 our wars ;and our army, brillant In the field, showed no leesa heroism under sufferisge and Privations still more trying-sufferings, the causes of which have meen faishully described in the admirable report of two imen, towards whom the gratltude,of the country lane found an enthusiastic expression.
That war was terminated by the Pence of Paris. which secured tones, on the wbole, all the objects for which the war had been under. taken, while the wire chan)ges In our military organization. introduced in the winter of 1854, and energetically carriedon In the followinglear, and, above all, the stabMtstr of our finances, enabled us to show ourselves to the nations of Eurore still fresh and ready for further strugglee, when our enemy and our allies semuEd alike exhausted.
Pesos being concluided, and the yeaLr of transition from war to peaoe having elapsed, it aLppeared to me that it woud be Indefensible to inks advantage of a technical error to fasten upon the country for another yeas the continuance of the war income-tax, which pressed so heavily on Ohs milddle classes, both agriculturl and commercial; and I rejoice that Her Majesty's Government shared In that opinion, and interposed no obstacle to the eaptimton of the tax
Though giving a general support to Her Majesty's Government. I have not suppressed my oonvicticus when a measure appeared to me Injurious to the interests or Inconsistent with the honour of ouLr country, On guch occasions, while refusing to eater into any party combination whatever, I have not been deterred by taunts or calumnies -the-, alshoos o a ay. frm gvin tothat which I thought
In he hinsedisuseos e ad wo u~insto decide_

Iurged the ending out immediate reinforcements, in order to crush the war by an overwhelming superiority of force, and the apyolutmect Of tmoan of weight and character to take the management of the war and the negotiations out of the hands of Sir John Hvowring.
I am glad to say that both are now being done.
dany with whom I v,eur ally act, and for whose motives I have the higBest respect, arrived at i different conclusion from myself; I regret that we should difler, hut L too, voted on the merits of the case alone, with a strong conviction of right, and without any party object or combination whatever.
To any measure, however, whether brought forward by the Governmentor by individuals, which appeared tome to be conducive to the pubUo welfare, I have given my hearty DUpot.
If returned to Parliament I shall cont& inuthe same course, furtherIvS all well-considered reforms, and eapeclaUy those reasures for the better instruction and organizstion of our army. whieh I believe to be necessry to its esisciescy. Looking upon them as urgent, I have pressed them on publio attention, arud I bave now, at the instanoe of the Government, undertaten the conduct of an inquiry into the whole sanitary system, and concition of the army, b"th at home and abroad, with & view to guard. so far an human precautions can avail; against the recurrence of evils from which we have Fo severely suffered.
By liberal, but moderate and enlightened, legilation, and by the ronttiuance of a fical policy which has reduced taxation, while it has augmented our revenue, the well-being and contenzment of the oommnunity can be best preserved ; while abroad, a firm assertion of our own rights, combined with respect for the indepentenoe of otber nations, and a crupulous adherence to good faith in our tra nsactions with them, wilt guarantee ecurity and honour to Brtish subjects and to the British flag teronuhout the world.
lUpon -hese principles I sball continue to act should you again do me the honour of returning me to Parliament.
I have the honour so be, Gentlemen,
Your faithful servant.

(IMOM 0U OWN CORRESPONDET-.)
A& portion of the following appe&red in our coona tion of vesterdAv:-1
PARIS, MARCIH 22, 6 pj,
The French Chambers, which, with ironical courtesy, are denominated Legislative, drag their slow length along, and noiselessly approach the tern, of their languid existence. Deputies are, however, beginning to bestir themselves with a view to their re-election, and the Prefects and other agents of the Government are, on their side, on the look out for men who, if they are inspired by no very ardent attachment to the rggime, will, at al events, give as little trouble as possible. A canvass is going on, not in the free and boisterous demonstrations of England, to which our attention is so much turned, but in the subdued and noiseless action suited to a system which interdicts aU unpleasant expression of the public wilL It is but the passing breeze which only ripples the surface of the pool enclosed in a barrier of granite, which shuts out aU excess and stops every outlet-the sigh of the wind which merely stirs the surface; not the rude ancd wholesome gale, which scourges before it the sluggish vapours, and purifies while it agitates. Such as it is, however, there is a movement; the few who have not yet given up the thought of seeing a Parliamentary Government once more in France try to preserve their seats, and hope against despair itself, and the rest, to whom the name of Deputy is also dear, work hard to secure their seats, their patronage-andtheir salaries. The movement is in great part attributable to the apprehensions of the monopolists that the Emperor is really desirous of making a breach in the barrier of commercial prohibition. The late project of law, which was prepared after great doubting and deliberation, introduced only such modifications in the tariffs of this country as fell short of actual prohibtion, and sufficed to fill the whole land with terror. So strong was the opposition it encountered, and so formidable were the means used to excite alarm and discontent among the ignorant masses, that the Emperor hesitated to hazard in favour of commercial emancipation a coup d'itat which yet was comparatively easy when suppressing political freedom; and, as you are aware, even the scanty reforms of his project were postponed for some years more. To guard as much as possible against the recurrence of the danger are the efforts of the Prohibitionists now directed, and in these, it appears, they are seconded by some members of the Imperial Cabinet. It was doubted by some whether the Emperor himself was sincerely in favour of a liberal system. The incidents I am about to mention would show that these doubts are unfounded, and that if he has not hitherto more openly manifested that disposition) it is because even le declines to encounter difficulties which, perhaps, are more formidable in appearance than in reality. M. Levavaseur, a rich proprietor add manufacturer of Rouen, is one of the representatives in the Legislative Chamber for the departmient of the Seineliferieure. Re has been a deputy for some years, and from his wealth, his station, and, doubtless, other useful qualitiesm is eminently popular with his constituents. What his political preferences may be I cannot say, but in his legislative and social capacity he has been a firm adherent, or, at all events, a constant supporter, of the Imperial Government since its establishment, and thus he naturally looked forward to the support of the Government in his election canvass. His surprise, however, was great when he learnt that, instead of support, he was menaced by official opposition, and that a new candidate was to be started against him. M. Levavaseur had not -committed the crime of advocating free trade, but he was suspected of having seceded frons the standard of Prohibition. He was known to have expressed the opinion that the time for absolute prohibition had gone by, and admitted that France was at last in a condition to imitate in some degree the commercial policy of nations even less favoured than she is. He was all the more encouraged in these views as he was under the impression that the Emperor himself shared them, and that his profession of faith would be an additional recommendation for Government support. In this he was mistaken. Bie found that his decided opponent was the Prefect of the department, acting, no doubt, under the instructions of his immediate chief, the Minister of the Interior; and this opposition appeared not long after a visit, now some months ago, to the departments of the north. M. levavaseur considered be was carrying out the wishes of the Government by giving up prohibition, though defending a high rate of protective duties, while the official pretended that he was running counter to the wishes of the Emperor. M. Levavaseur was extremely puzzled; he determined to come up to Paris and hear from the Emperor himself an explanation of the difficulty. He did come to Paris, and had an audience of, His Majesty. Of the details of the conversation between them I am not aware; I only know that he was informed that by his advocacy of tariff reforms he by no means forfeited the goodwill of the Emperor, however he might have earned the hostility of the officials; and I may add that M. Levavaseur found, to his surprise, the Emperor far more liberal than he had ever supposed. His Majesty has a good deal to think of, and words spoken during a hurried interview are oftenforgotten. M.Levavaseur thought it prudent to draw up a memorandum, setting forth his complaints of the conduct of the Ministerial agents against himself, and this memorandum was -deposited with the Emperor's private secretary, to be laid before His Majesty. It is evident, then, that --the Emperor is far from being a Prohibitionist-is, perhaps, not even a Protectionist ; but that some of his ow-n Ministers are increasing the difiiculties to his carrying his plan into execution. It is to be hoped, however, that in spite of the opposition of the Prefect of the department and his superiors, the election of so influential a convert will be secured.
The conflict which has arisen with AL de Dreux-Breze, Bishop of Moulins, continues to furnish ample material to the organs of the Paris press and the departments. The two more serious grounds of complaint against that prelate are his publication of certain synodal statutes, prohibiting the clergy of the diocess from having recourse to the secular tribunals against episcopal authority, and his habitually requiring the eventual resignation of the priests he appoints to parishes concurrently with those appointments. Both practices are pronounced ilegaL In virtue of the Concordat with Rome, it appears that those priests are notremovable. A complaintagainst the bishop was forwarded to the Minister of Public Instruction, and by him was referred to the Council of State. The Council of State referred in turn to one of its sections for the purpose of drawing up a report, and it communicated directly with the prelate. M. de DreuxBreze's reply is described as diffuse and rather .evasive, but there is sufficient to indicate that he does not recognize the authority of the Council. The report of the comrmission (M. Suin is the reporter) will probably be against him, and also the majority of the Councillors. In the meantime the Emperor has written an autograph letter to the Pope, probably urging a friendly remonstrance, or perhaps suggesting the appointment of a coadjutor, _as the most prudent way of turning the difficulty. The same law which makes the cur6 irremovable protects the bishop also.
. de Dreux-Breze was raised to the episcopacy -during the presidency of the Emperor. His politi-al opinions are Legitumist, and in religious doctrine be is Ult'aGontane. He was one of the few prelates, -if, indeed there were any others-who did not _~i+*+uas s4e -a o the i P
^,ww ; ne apsmofthe infant Prince. To be -onsistent he should have refused promotion, honour, or emoluilent ifom any but a Legitimist
Government. M. de Dreux-Brez e is the second son -of the Master of the Ceremonies who was sent by the Court in 1789 to com the Tiers Etat to break
up their meeting, ad to wbsQ n Mirabeau made the famous answer " Go tell your master that we are here by the wilof the people, ad that we shall not quit this palace except by the foree of bayonets."
The Council of State has, or soon will have, another proposition before it direesed against persons who assume titles to which theY have no right. The Counts, Viscounbt, and Barons, who, like the Cpainted jay," deck themselves in borrowed plumes, are numerous beyond calculatiom. They
infest us everywhere. It is proposed to make it penal for any one to ansume a title the genuinene-s of which he cannot prove. Such assumption
vas penal, I believe, till 1832. At that period the law was abrogated. Any fool
was allowed to give himself w hatever fo - briquet he thought proper. It may be doubted whether there are many adventurers--d lies i driadustrie or members of the demi-rWnde-worth Wk-
iDg of who do not promote their suew ae iia ter X
respective lines by souse such brilliant appendage. The utility, however, of a penal enactment is equivocal, but the adversaries of the Imperial Governmeint approve it highly, as it will, in their opinion, excite much discontent among the " plucked," whether Imperialists or not, and consequently increase the number of its enemies.
M. de FaUoux's reception at the French Academy vill take place on the 26th. As it is the custom, the speech prepared for that occasion has been submitted to the inspection of an academic commiss'ion. One sentence-the concluding one, I believeit was thought necessary to retrench, owing to its decidedly Legitimist character. The academicians, though well disposed to carry on an indirect warfare against the Government, are too prudent to commit themselves openly, and M. de Failoux's flowing but too unmistakeable period has been cut short. In former times it was usual to introduce a compliment of some kind, more or less vapid, to the person who was the chief of the State. The custom has been entirely omitted in the case of the present Emperor.
Accounts from Naples state that the King has authorized the modification of the prisons iu his dominions, and ordered considerable improvements in the penitentiary system. For some days past it has been rumoured that the King is disposed to make concessions in favour of his unhappy subjects. Several attempts at a reconciliation were made, but without success. Now, however, it is said that a M. Pinelli is deputedto Paris charged with a mission, which, of course, is not official, but still a mission, and which it is thought may lead to a reconciliation.
A French Cabinet courier left to-day for Turin with despatches for the Duke de Grammont. The suspension of diplomatic relations between Austria and the Court of Turin seems certain, notwithstanding the efforts to prevent it.
A letter from Rome of the 19th inst. states that negotiations are proceeding between the directors of the Lombardo-Venetian and the Roman Railway Companies for anamalgamation of those lines, which are connected at two points, Ferrara and Bologna. The Duke de Rianzares and Count Antonelli, who are one the president and the other the vice-president of the board of directors of the Roman Railways, are actively occupied in studying all questions connected with the railways which are to run through the Roman States, and it has been proposed to them by the directors of the Lombardo-Venetian Company to construct and work in common the sections from Ferrara to Bologna and from Bologna to Ancona. The Government, it is said, approves this arrangement.
His Highness Said Pasha, Viceroy of Egypt, published during his late journey orders to each of the governors of the provinces of SennaarKordofan, Letaka, Berber, and Dongola, regulating the rents and taxes to be paid by the cultivators of the soil, and abolishing various oppressive customs which former governors countenanced. His Highness further regulated the military service in those provinces. The first order is dated Kartoum, the 26th of last January. It says that, being occupied in devising plans for the prosperity of the country and the happiness of the inhabitants, he will begin by protecting them from oppression. When he arrvecd in Soudan and saw the misery which existed in consequence of the inhabitants being oppressed with taxation and overcharges, he demanded of the sheiks and the inhabitants who came to meet him what he could do to secure their tranquillity. They replied by praying that his Highness would reduce the taxes levied on each sakil to 250 piastres.
"But," said his Highness, "as my love for my people impels me to give them the greatest possible prosperity and to secure their affection, and as, moreover, I wish to restore confidence to those who have expatriated themselves, in order that they may return to their country, their minds free from all fear of oppression, injustice, or excessive taxation, I have commanded that the taxes shall ba fixed at 200 piastres for each saeki, and no more."
The Pasha then commands that the chiefs of districts who formerly collected the taxes shall be dismissed and the soldiers they employed disbanded. Henceforth the villagers themselves will pay the taxes into the hands of the sheiks. In order to induce the sheiks to act fairly by the inhabitants, they are to be remunerated for their aervices. The proprietors of houses where travellers receive hospitality are to be exempt from taxation. Everything which the Government requires, such as camels, provisions, or workmen, is to be paid for, and there is to be no more forced labour. The inhabitants are to be encouraged to cultivate indigo, cotton, and sesame for oil, of which they are to enjoy aU the profit. All offences against the laws are to be tried by the cadis, and the sheiks are to execute the sentence. His Highness next commands that a postal service shall be established between Cairo and the Ghezireh, in Sennaar-Kordofan and Taka, and from Ghezireh to Albou-Khamat. Stations are to be established for camels and dromedaries at ten hours' march distant. He tells them, in case those stations should be attacked, to let him know the fact at Cairo, and that he wil send a force " which will carry terror into the hearts of the aggressors." In conclusion, the Pasha observes that hitherto the thieves and assassins sentenced to hard labour for life had been confined in the prisons of Soudan, whereas if they had been transported to a distance from their families it might have had a better effect in deterring them from crime, and that henceforth those sentenced in Soudan to hard labour for life shall be sent to Egypt to expiate their crimes, and those sentenced in Egypt shall be sent to Soudan.
The French Government, in consequence of the importance which the colony of Senegal has acquired within the last few years, has appointed a superior officer of the navy, whose duty it will be to direct and centralize, under the authority of the Government, the movements of the ships of war at the colony. By the same decree the captain of the frigate Duroc is named to fill that situation. He is to reside at St. Louis, and is to hoist his flag in the steam cutter Podor.
The Patrie announces that the arrangements for the amalgamation of the Paris and Lyons and the Lyons to the Mediterranean Railway Compauies are concluded. Three shares of the Lyons to the Mediterranean Company are admitted against four of the Paris and Lyons Company.
The Journal de Constantiwple of the 12th, which had announced the capture of the British steamer Kangaroo by some Russian gunboats, now corrects that information, and announces the safe arrival of the Kangaroo in the Bosphorus after having landed her passengers and freight on the coast of Circassia. TheRussianAmbassador had demanded explanations of the Porte, which had appointed a commission of inquiry. An armistice for three months had been concluded between the British and Persian troops.
Accounts from Corfu are of the 9th. The late elections in that island had been annulled, and a dissolution was considered probable.
The 3foniteur publishes a report to the Emperor from the Chancellor of the Legion of Honour, giving an account of the disposal of 400,000 francs intrusted to him for distribution among the old soldiers who served between the years 1792 and 1815. More than ,000 old soldiers had petitioned for relief. A selection was made, and the 400,000 francs were divided among 4,207 chosen from the most aged, the most needy, and the most deserving of the applicants. It appears from the report that
tnere still1 exist in ]!rance and in Algeria76',769 soldiers of the old Imperial army, of whom more than 4(0,000 require assistance from the Government.

VIENNA, MARcH 19.
According to authentic advices from Bucharest, the Commissioners for England, Turkey, France, and Sardinia are already in that capital. M. Lichmann, the Austrian Commissioner, will probably arrive there this evening. M. Basily, the representative of Rossia, ia still here, and here he intends to remain until he has received positive information that the Austriams and Turks have completely evacuated both princpalities. In as far as the Austrians are coneermed Us mind will soon be at rest, as official news has been received that all the Imperial troops will be on this side of the frontier within a week. The Freneh papers have recently stated that there has been some approximation in the views of France and Austria in respect to the Danubian Principalities, but the news must be received with great reserve. Austria will certainly not object to a Customs Union, or to any o,her measures that may be caloalated tb- develope the resources and increase the prosperity of the two PrinoipaRties, but she will never voluntarily consent ts their political union under one sovereign.
The ,onientz of this paragraph will sufficiently epia tr jpur readcrs why Eo much has. been gaid
in my correspor'dence respecting the Concordat and its probable tonsequences. The Cardinal Archbishop of 9ienna, who has long been dissatisfied with ti'.,d way in which the " press-bureau!' has discharged its duties, has now taken the matter into his own hands, and demanded the entire prohibition of five daily papers, all of which have a good reputation in Germany. They are,-the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, the Hamburger Nachrichten, the |Neue Miiiwlwater Nachrirhten, the Fratkfurter Joutrinal, and the Breslauer Zeitung. His Eminence further demands that the correspondents of the foreign papers should be " kept in better order." The meaning of the sentence quoted is that no writer for the foreign press shall in future be allowed to make any mention of the continual and dangerous encroachments of the Roman Catholic hierarchy. In a pastoral letter which has just been published the Bishop of Budweis, in Bohemia, complains of the lukewarmness of his ilocL-, and menaces them with most severe disciplinary punishment if they do not mend their ways. As the rev,.father in God is of opinion that the Roman Catholic who only confesses once a year (at Easter) is little better than a lost sheep, he insists on frequent confession, and orders his clergy to refuse to administers the last consolations of religion to those who do not obey his commands. He also threatens to refuse to permit the mortal remains of the refractory to be interred in consecrated ground. A letter addressed to the Yolksfreulnd by a priest clearly shows that the violence of the bishops has produced a most unfavourable impression on the people. The rev. gentleman complains that the body of a deceased person is often quite cold before the priest is sent for, so that he is unable to administer the sacrament of extreme unction. The fact is that many Roman Catholics in this city refuse to confess and receive the sacrament before their death, and the relatives. fearing that the priest may decline to bury the corpse in consecrated ground, send for him afterwards, in order that extreme unction may be administered. The Bishop of Leitmeritz, also in Bohemia, has just published a list of questions wbich, in his diocess, are to be put to all the candidates for the sacrament of marriage. The questions to be addressed to the bridegroom are 24 in number, and among them are the following:-
12. Are yon related to your bride?
"16. Had or has your bride a sister V'
If the priest thinks fit, he is to put the following questions:-
" 17. Did you ever promise marriage to the mother or sister of your bride?
" 18. Did you ever have sexual intercourse with the mother, sister, aunt, or first cousin of your wife P'
A widower is to be asked whether he, during the lifetime of his deceased wife, has had sexual intercourse with.his bride. The bishop further orders that similar questions are to be put to the bride, and in addition to them the following:-
"418. Areyou pregnant, and, if so, does your bridegroom know that such is the case ?"
The affianced couple are to be questioned in the presence of each other and of the witnesses. Tn addition to the foregoing, every non-Catholic bridegroom must solemnly promise to the priest that all the children which his Catholic wife may bear shall be brought up in the faith of their mother.
The day before yesterday, while the Empress was taking a drive with one of her maids of honour, she suddenly asked her whether she knew where the Princess Thurn and Taxis, the widow of the late Grand Master of the Household, lived. As the reply was in the affirmative, orders were at once given to drive to the Singer S+rasse, where the Princess lives, and a visit of condolence was paid by Her Majesty, which must have been more than a matter of mere form as it lasted nearly an hour. On Monday, in the evening, the Empress held a cerde, as it is here called, and it was remarked that Her Majesty has lost a great deal of that timidity which she displayed before she went to Italy. The same observation was also made the next evening in the apartments of the Archduchess Sophia, where there were private theatricals for the amusement of the I full-grown guests, and a magic lantern for the edificationof therisingjgeneration. For the first time since she has been the consort of the Emperor, Her Majesty spoke without hesitation to the gentlemen attached to the Court.
Yesterday it was decided by Government that the contractors for the Austro-French railroads should not be permitted to " capitalize" their 10 per cent. tagitiame. The gentlemen in question proposed to make 40,000 new shares, and to take them at par, as ain indemnification for their 10 per cent. tantiOme during 99 years.
During the last three weeks several letters, in which mention was made of M. Bianchi, of Mantua, have been received here, but the statements of the writers were so contradictory that it was impossible to make any use of them. Yesterday, however, some information was obtained which is probably correct, although it came from a military source. M. Bianchi has recovered from the wounds inicted on him by the officers, and the latter have been acquitted. There is some reason to believe that M. Bianchi had been indulging in strong drinks before he went to the theatre, and that he, and not the officer, began the quarrel. How it happened that the officer who attacked an unarmed man with his sword was liberated from prison my informant was either unwilling or unable to state. By the by, the last number of the Chlarinari, in which the glorious victory obtained by the Austrian officers over M. Bianchi at Mantua is ilustrated, has given such offence to the Austrians that a formal complaint is lik-ely to be made to Baron de Bourqueney on the subject.
The A lgsburg Gazette learns from Turin that the Roman Catholic Bishops in Savoy were already beginning to take advantage of the misunderstanding between Austria and Sardinia. Monsignor Losonna has published what he is pleased to call " a pastoral letter," which contains little but abuse of Count Cavour and of a constitutional form of government. The Bishop of Annecy, who declares.Piedmont to be " a very hotbed of disorder and social spasms," concludes his address to his flock with the words *Death to Liberty !"
It is rumoured that the Archduke Charles Louis, the present Stadtholder of the Tyrol, wil soon be made Governor of Gallicia. The youthful Prince, who is one of the most devout Catholics in the empire, is said to have a strongly pronounced dislike to the heterodox Russians. Count Jellachich, who is but the shadow of his former self, will come here on the 24th for medical advice. The Ban, who three or four years ago was full of strength and vigour, is now an old man.
RUSSIA.
(FRtOM OU BERLIN contMoND2Tr.)
BIERLIU, fsAcn 2L
A recent number of the Northern Bee publishes a number of particulars connected with the journey of the Grand Duke Constantine to Switzerland and Sardinia, which come up to so recent a date as the end of February. From them we learn that the Grand Duke has made the acquaintance of our young Prince Alfred in Geneva, at the house of his sister, the Grand Duchess Anna Feodorowna, who has for many years past lived there. The reception which he met with at the Court of Turin and generally fromithe population of Piedmont Eeems to have given the Grand Duke, and more particularly his suite, the greatest satisfaction; the latter have even made3 the discovery
that the Piedmontese have a very considerable and natural fondness for the Russians.
The leading Russian journals are at present devoting their columns and their attention to the political events in England, in which te greatest interest is evinced; the novelty of telegraphic despatches bringing information of the debates that took place in the bouses of Parliament within 24 hours of their publication to St. Petersburg, thus anticipating t-he ordinary channels of information by about eight days, tends to enhance the lively interest naturally felt in any crisis affecting the Government of Rnssia's great rival. I need hardly tell you that the lacubrations the events in London give rise to in St. Petersbrg are not exactly of a nature to be palatable to kord Palmerston's admnirers; neither in these, nor & the various articles on the subject of the diferences beteween Persia and England, which EeemL no* to la setled, is there anything worth my pitting beifoe your readers. The NorHern Bee points cut, with & eertainr degree of acerbity, how Paris has become nowr the v'.entre of all the diplomatic business of Europe; nC't only were the Peace Conferences at the end of the' late war held there, but also more. recently the tet'tlement of the peace between England and Pers.,a, though France was no party to tlhe war, hau taken! place in Paris; and even the Neuchatel affair, in
spite of the precedent thatELondon has in its favour, I LiR being brought before the fires. of tbe ropsj~
Powers in the French capital. The observation I made to you some time back about the political szathies of the Russian press still holds good.
ie the animosity against Austria, which has been openly manifested aver since the war entered into its concluding phase, continues unabated and undiminished, the more than conciliatory language towards France has lost all its warmth and courting tone, while the asperities felt towards England during the war are rapidly vanishing and giving place to a feeling of respect and a convnction of the mutual necessity of the two countries to each other. A very thin veil is now allowed to obscure the expression of the conviction that the intimate alliance with France has already produced all the good it is likely to produce, and may now be dispensed with. With the spring and summer the Danubian Principalities and the Black Sea will be entirely evacuated, and then the former amicable and commercial relations between Russia and England, that had previously lasted for 300 years, cannot fail to be restored. This return to a former state of feeling it is however admitted will not prevent collisions of various kinds occurring between the two Governments, and even without any instructions between their servants in Asia, where the interests of the two countries are opposed to each other; in Europe, on the other hand, the two countries have one common interest -viz., while cultivating all amicable relations with France, not to cede to her that overwFeening influence which she at present exerts in European affairs.
The hostilities in which China is now becoming involved with one, if not more, "barbarian" State, form a subject of the highest interest to Russia and the press there; the very words used by the leading speakers in the recent debates in our Houses of Parliament have been faithfully translated into Russian journals, an amount of accuracy and circumstantiality that has hitherto never been bestowed on any foreign discussions. Tho opinion which the Russians at first formed, that these hostilities on the eastern coast of China would lead to an increase of their trade on the western land frontier of that empire, seems to be giving way to a lively apprehension that they will produce the opposite effect; this is expected to arise, not so much from the usual impoverishing effects of war as from the circumstance that the interruption of the Chinese commercial relations with Europe is stopping the import of slver at the Chinese ports: the price of silver is already very high in that country, and there seems now every reaon to expect it will rise considerably higher. The inevitable consequence of this excessive rise in the price of silver in China will be, that the Chinese demand in Kiakhta for Russian merchandise is likely to be very materially reduced.
The reports of a contemplated treaty of commerce and navigation between Russia and France gain rapidly in consistency; it is now confidently affirmed that the draught of the treaty is already entirely elaborated, and that its final execution and publication are only delayed until the very thorough revision of the Russian tariff, which is now being most assiduously laboured at, is completed.
The Managing Committee of the Company for building the Russian railways notified on the 12th inst. that the fourth portion of the first issue of shares in Russia, that is to say, 150,000 shares, is about to be opened to public subscription. The subscription is to be open from April 16th (28th) till April 23d (May 4th); the araount to be paid down is 12r. 60c. per share, which on allotment is to be made up to 60r., or 30 per cent. of the whole amount. This intimation has, naturally enough, drawn the attention of capitalists and economists in Russia with redoubled acumnen to the examination of the merits of the entire question. For the sake of those at a distance it will be expedient for me 'to select from the numerous articles that have of late appeared on the subject one that was published iu the EconomicsiZ Advertiser of St. Petersburg a litfle time previous to this advertisement of the opening of the subscription listsbeingpublished, premising only that its expressed intention is to remove the impression still lurldng in Russia that foreigners will make too good a thing out of the construction of railways in Russia. Of the latter it is said that the foreigners have for the most part estimated the costs of constructing the lines far too low. Marshes, considerable streams, which often overflow their shallo w banks and lay larze tracts of land under water, ravies or deep and wide rain-gullies, which intersect the steppes ofL Newv Russia, the very rocky terrain in the central governments of Russia, more particularly between MIoscow and Oral, the total absence of stone and wood in the steppes, &c., are circumstances which will necessarily render these constructions very difficult and expensive. Iron, even if it is to be imported from England, will be fearfully eiihanced in cost by the expense of transport; the price of labour in those thinly-populated districts cannot yet be estimated, and the inevitable suspension of the works during the winter months will cause considerable accumulations of interest on the capital paid in, and even when the lines approach completion the want of fuel cannot fail to be very sensibly felt.
Among the advantages that Russia will derive from these works, whenever they are finished, is pointed out that with these increased means of locomotion it will no longer be necessary to concentrate large bodies of troops in localities where it is difficult or expensive to provision them; and the fortresses, which have hitherto been kept up chiefly for the purpose of accommodating these large bodies of men, and of protecting the necessarily large quantities of provisions for their support and their mat4riel of war, can in future be considerably reduced. The State is at present at an annual expense of 6,000,000 roubles for the maintenance and repair of the canals and high roads, while the arrangements for
psting (horses, &c.) cost the country 7,000,000. Into both these departments, doubtless, great reductions will in future be introduced, an earnest of which is given in the permission issued by the Government for the civil and military engineers in its service to enter the employment and pay of these foreign private speculators.
The Chelsea Board Of Inquiry.-Yesterday
TsRz C}ELSEA BoARD or IToQuuy.-Yesterday was published, by order of the late House of Commons a memorandum and explanation in regard to a section of tLo Report of the Board of General Officers appointed to ingqre into certain statements contained in the reports of sir J. &leill and Colonel Tulloch. The explanation was called for by the First Lord of the Treasury and the Chancellor of the Exchequer with reference to the alleged insufficiency of the land transport service and the supply of forage, the want of whicb, it is intimated in the report, was owing to the omission on the part of the Treasury to send out a proper sopply of that article from England. This explanation was caed for last August. Sir C. B. Trevelyan's explanation occupies a space of somae 22 pages. Having completed his narrative and explanation of the proceeinZgs of the Treasnry with reference to the series of Commissary Filder's letters, Sir Charles thinks " he may justly state that so long as those letters were suggestive and indefinite, and not immediate, the Treasury proceeded towards the fulfilment of his Euggestions and recommendations with a proper reference to the circumstances before them. But when, as in the latter letters, the suggestions bad the character of requisites, and became precise, pressing, and urgent, they were immediately acceded to by the Treasury, and distinct directions wero given to carry them promptly into effect." " In this view of the proceedings," he adds, " they are entirely free from the blame implied in the Report of the Board of General Officers in respect to the non-supply of forage; and ac cordingly, even if the want of forage had been the proximate cause of the failure of the land transport, and consequently of the sufferings of the army, the Treasury could not justl, be held in any degree responsible for those sufferings." There are copious appendice.
BRTS}H SAILORS nI VsuopDiA.-On Thursday last two free negroes, William Carter and John Powell, seamen on boa,d the British bark Bilow, were arrested in our city for being absent from their vessel without leave, and were orderod by the Mayor to be punished with stripes by virtue of an Act of Assembly in such cases made and provided. The punishment was commuted with the assent of the captain of the bark to the payment of costs of arrest and other usnal charges, to which, however, Her Majesty's Consul, Mr. G. P. R. James, demurred, upon the ground of the negroes being British subjects, and therefore exempt from the punishment to which otherfree negroes were liable for a violation of the aforesaid Act of Assembl. Our worthy Mayor, however, maintained his authority mn the matter, and gave Her Majesty's representative the alternative to pay charges or submit to the punishment of the negroes, the former of which he adopted under protest. The decisionof the Mayor in this came is in striet conformity with State sovereignty, the maintenance of which is absolutely necessary for the preservation of the rights of the slaveholdine States.-Norfolk (Virginia) 4sp&s If the South could hot make the North fight for despotism, we should soon sea an abatement of the pretensions of the slaveowners, and a great improvement in their conduct towards foreign countries.-Neteoyrk Europjan,

[A snmmars of the following, received by electric telagraph, appeared in our second edition of yesterday:-]
SOJTHAMPTON, MoiNDLy.
The Royal Mail Company's steamship Parana, Captain T. A. Bevis, arrived this morning with the West India mails, in charge of Lieutenant John Brown, X.N., Admiralty agent. Her dates are-- Nassau (Bahamas) ... Feb. 17 Grenada ... Feb. 28 Belize(Honduras) ... - 17 St. Vincent ...March 1 Kingston (Jamaica) - 27 St. Lucia ... - 2 Jacmel (Hayti) ... - 28 Xatinique - 2 San Juan (Porto Guadaloupe - 2

The Parana was delayed at St. Thomas's till the 7th inst., waiting for the Royal Mail steamer Trent, with the mails from the Spanish Alain; but, the latter vessel not having arrived, the Parana proceeded on to England on the morning of the 7th, and we are consequently without mails from that quarter.

This steamer brings 26 passengers. On freight she has specie, in silver, $15,440; gold and silver coin, $21,386 50 cents.; and old silver, $515-total, $37,341, 50 cents. Her cargo comprises 191 serons of cochineal, 230 serons of indigo, 90 bags of cocoa, 8 cases of succades, and 40 packages of sundries.
Her Majesty's ships at Port Royal, Jamaica, on February 17th, were the Termagant, Imaum, Arab, and Pioneerw on the Wcindward Island station, the Eurydice and Brilliant. The Basilisk was on her way to Bermuda, to join the Admiraln; the Euryalus at Hlavancho ; the erachne at St. Domingo.
The United States' steam-frigate Merrinac called of St. Thomas on the 5th inst., but having several cases of fever on board she was noS allowed to comamlunicate with the shore, and on the 6th sihe pro ceeded on a cruise to the northward.
There is no news from Jamaica. The new Governor was anxiously looked for, and every day expected. The Legislature was not in session. The island was generally healthy, and the ensuing sugar crops presented a very cheerful aspect. Mining operations were reported to be very favourable. In butter there had been some sales of Irish at 14d. per lb. There was no coffee at market, and no operations in corn to report. Re-sales of flour had been made of 1,500 barrels, at 42s. per barrel. The stock of lard was very light, and there had been sales at 12d. to 13Sd. per lb. The last sales of alewives in cargo realze 24s. per barreL In pork sales of mess had been made at 105s., but the stock being very light 115s. vas demanded; a lot of 600 odd barrels prime mess sold at 92s., but the market was firm at IOs. for that description. Rice was dull of sale-at 14s. 6d. The sugar-market was very active, and sales averaged 22s. to 25s., according bo quality. Nothing to report in tobacco. Irisn tongues were very scarce; a small lot sold at 68s. Exchanges on London, at Jamaica and colonial banks-90 days, i per cent. prem.; 60 days, 1 per cent. prem. ; 30 days, 1J per cent. prem.; private bills at par. On New York-merchants' bills, 1 per cent. prom.
At Barbadoes the attention of commercial men was occupied with a project started by the " West India, North and South American Telegraph Company," to lay down a line of submarine telegraph, connecting the West Indies with the North and South American continents, the line then to be placed in connexion with thetransatlantic line which is about to be laid down. Public meetings had been held to hear the scheme explained by Captain Raasloff, a gentleman of great reputation as an engineer, lately inthe service of HIis Danish Majesty. The proposed terminusi of the submarine telegraph is St. Augustine, in Florida, or siome other convenient point on the south-eastern coast of the Jnited States. It will be carried thence to St. Thomas under a concession which has already been obtained from the Government of Denmark, and thence to some suitable point on the coast of South America, vid the West Indian Ilands. The required capital to lay down the line will be 350,0001.; and it is proposed that, while the British Government should be asked to guarantee the company (on the line cominig into operation) business to the extent of 7,0001. per annum, certain of the West India colonies most favourably positioned for the laying down of adirect line should also guarantee the company for a term of years basiness to the amount of 7,0001. a-year likewise; which would together be a guarantee of 4 per cent. on the assumed capital. The company, wishing to have as direct a route and few stations as possible, had determined to appeal in the first instance, to Barbadoes, Demerara, and Antigua. The plan had been weU received, and the House of Assembly had almost unanimously adopted resolutions approving the project. His Excellency the Governor had, in reply to a deputation, promised his cordial support to the measure. The weather at Barbadoes continued cool, and somewhat tantalizing for crop operations, wrhich had, nevertheless, been active, and a fair amount of sugar had been made. 1,363 hlids. 89 tierces and 76 barrels had been shipped to the 26th ult. The health of the island was all that could be desired.
From Trinidad advices are to the 27th ult. A detachment of the left wing of the 41st Regiment, under the command of Major Bush, arrived from Portsmouth on the 17th, in excellent health and spirits. In the absence of arrivals, flour had taken an unexpected rise since the previous mail. Provisions had also inproved in value. 1,350 bags of East India rice (yellow), from Demerara and Barbadoes, had arrived, and remained mostly in the hands of importers, as the offers made for it by retail dealers were not sufficient to corer cost and charges. Dry and pickled fish was getting in demand, which would continue during the season of Lent. In p roduce there was a very dull fortnight to report, little or no business being done. The weather had been so exceedingly wet that nearly aU estates had suspended crop operations for the moment, and the season bore aU the appearance of continuing a wet one. Tonnage not required just now.
His Excellency Governor Kortright met the Legislature of Granada on the 17th ult., and opened the session. The Bill for incorporating the town of St. George and enabling other districts of the colony to incorporate themselves had been thrown out. The weather had turned out very unfavourable for the reaping of the sugar crop, in which a general beginning had been made throughout the colony. Heavy rains daily interrupted the manufiacturing process, and rships which ought to have had quick despatch were thus detained waiting for produce. The public health continued good. B3usiness was pretty brisk, and expected to continae improving.
From MIartinique we hear that the unfortunate inhabitants of GrosMorne have been the victims of another fire, which befel them on the 2d of February and totally consumed the few houses which had escaped the conflagation of Christmas-eve. Subscriptions were being raised in Guadaloupe and Martinique for the benefit of the sufferers. Sugar was reported scarce in the St. Pierre market, and the prices there ranged from 32f. to 35f. per 50 kilogrammes (about 26s. to 29s. per cwt.).

The accretions to the fund from this source now amount to 400,0001. The increase in the income of the " Common Fund" bas justified the expenditure of 5,0001. in making better provison for the cure of souls The total number of oenefices permanently augmented by the Commissioners, exclusive of sew districts, amounted, on the Ist of November last, to £76, with an aggregate population of 2 389 352, and the annual grants made in respoect of those benedces, exclusive of the value of land and tithe rentcharge annexed in certain cases, amounted, in the ageregate, to 46,763L The total number of districts constitutea by the Commissioners up to November 1 was 249t and their aggregate population 864,0S1 aind of these 209 districts have already been provided with churches, and so become ",new parisbes," and the incumbentg thereof have become entitled to an annual income of 1501. at least, besides dues and surplice fees.

Monday Evening.
The E5nglish funds opened this morning at the mproved quotbtions of Saturday, but the market -was dull, and there was ultimately a reaction of orn eighth. Consols for money were first quoted 930 -to i, and the last transactions were at 93i to § for zxmoney, and 934 to I for the 8th of April. Ex-chequer-bonds left off at 981 to 99; India Bonds, 2s. discount to par; and Exchequer-bils 5June), 3s1 di count to par, (March) par to 3s. premium.
In foreign securities there was not much activity, iut prices on the average continue to be fairly supTported. Transactions took place in Mexican for the acocunt at 23ft and J. Turkish Six per Cents., for mnoney and account, were negotiated at 98$. The general business has comprised-Brazilian Four-auda-Half per Cents., New, 98i ; Ecuador New Con*olidate, 15; Mexican, for account, 23- and i; {Peruvian, for account, 77j; Portuguese Three per eents., for account, 45i; the Three per Cents., 1856, 45 ; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 97-; ,the Small, 98- Sardinian Five per Cents., 90k. s;panish Three per Cents., for account, 41j and .
the New Deferred, for account, 256 and *; and I)ufch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 65.
The final quotations of the French Three per 4Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were
'0f. 55c. for money and 70f. 75c. for the end of cIhe month, showing another fall of an eighth.
In the corn-market this morning there was a -decline of 2s.
About 31,0001. in gold was taken from the Bank to-day for exportation.
Advices from Brussels announce that the Governmnent propose to convert the Five per Cent. Belgian Bonds into Four-and-a-Half per Cents. A premium of J per cent. is to be allowed to holders accepting 'these terms, and the entire operation is to be comipleted by the 3d of April. A sinfilar proposition w*-vmade at the end of 1852.
It is stated from Amsterdam that an application for the new Snanish loan of A. Mires to be quoted in the official list has been rejected. The rule on -that Bourse is the same as in the London Stock-
kxchange vith regard to the securities of countries degraded by acts of confiscation.
Letters from Hamburg state that the moneymarket has again become easier, the rate of discount having receded to 5 per cent.
It appears that the capital allowed by the Russian -Government for the Riga Railway is 1,636,5001.,
'with a guarantee of 4i per cent., of which i per -.nt. is to be applied as sinking fund. The directors -estimate the actual cost at 1,340,0001., and they
-wil consequently be enabled to issue the 201. shares at a discount, so as to make the guaranteed interest cqual to 5 per cent. The arrangements originally held out by them in their prospectus wil therefore *)e v:rtually realized, the company not being responsible for the damage subsequently inflicted on the prospects of the undertaking by the intention of the Government to construct a line to Libau, and to issue other Russian railway shares upon conditions that must cause them to become a drug.
the prospectus has been issued of the Tzinidad Bailway Company, with a capital of 300,0001. in 101. shares. It is proposed, in the first instance, to -construct about 50 miles, to bring some of the principal sugar districts into connexion with the coast, and an application will be made to the local Legislature for a guarantee of 6 per cent.
Owing tothe mails frost Santa Martha, Carthagen.a, Colon, and Greytown not having arrived at St. Thomas when the Parana sailed, the specie brought by that vessel is only 7,6001.
The accounts from the manufacturing towns for the past week show no material variation, the attention of all classes having been directed to the approaching elections. At Manchester the markets -have been steady, but without animation. The Biirmingham report mentions the receipt of improved orders for iron from the United States, while there has also been a full export demand for other goods. At Nottingham business has been well sustrined, both in hosiery and lace, and a great spring trade is relied upon. In the woollen districts there has been dulness.
The departures from the port of London for the Australian colonies during the past week have com-prised six vessels-three to Sydney, two to Port =hillip, and one to Adelaide,-with an aegregato capacity of 3,740 tons. The rates of freight have exhibited greater firmness.
In the general business of the port of London 'during the past week there has been increased ac-
tivity. The total number of ships reported inward was 238, showing an augmentation of 95. Those included 54 with cargoes of grain, rice, &c., 22 with cargoes of sugar, and 3 from China, with tea and silk, comprising 24,784 packages of the former, and .4,800 bales of the latter, worth about half a million at rling. The number of ships cleared outward was 310, including 11 in ballast, showing an increase of 9.
A Parliamentary paper has just been issued show3ng the total imports of grain and floir into this -country for the past year, fromn which the following table is compiled. It will be observed that threefourths of our total supply of foreign flour were obtained from the United States, in addition to Three-fifths of the amount of Indian corn and more tian a fourth of the amount of wheat:-
The Foam has arrived from Shanghai with *Z43,6001b. of tea and 1,383 bales of silk.
In the Berlin correspondence of The Times it will be noticed that subscriptions have been invited at St. Petersburg for a portion of the new railway scheme. The lists are to be open from the 16th of -April to the 4th of May, an;a 30 per cent. is to be piaid upon allotment.
The following relates to the Kinzigthal Mining 'Company:-
" Sir,-The Kinzigtbal Mining Association accounts are inadvertently misstated by the Mining Joscrnal, quoted by :outhismorn,ing. In the English disbursements appear 'raughts of Mes.Rothschild, of Frankfort, upon the Lou(on administration, providing thereby the funds disbursed in
.cess of mining products as they appear in the German 31anAce-sheet. The error consists in treating the English daughte and their German equivalent (2,9881. 19s. 7d., or *34, fl 36k.) as independent expenditure, thus doubling theactual amount. Thebalance aainstthemines at the *endzf 1856 is shown to be about 1,6001., and contra is the iagmented value of buildings, machinery, &c.

Thegrosajointreceipts for traffic under the areement with the Edinburgh, Perth, and D-andee Railway Company amounted to 170,361U., of which the Scottish Central proportion, including tolhge, is 77,2061., and the proportion of the working expenses 31,8W., leaving a balance of 45,3471., being 3,973t. rore than at the corre-ponding period of last year. To this is added 1,134., int.rest alowed on excess of plant, making 46,4811. From ihis is deducted 16,9431. for interest, law, taxation, and Parliamentary expenses, leaving 29,5381., being an increase of 2,9231. over the corresponding period of last year. The directors recommend a dividend at tho rate of 5.1 per cent. per annum, less income-tax, on the consolidated stoclk, payable on the 6th of April, leaving a balance of 1.488.

DUBTLI AND KINGSTOWN.
The report of the directors of this company states that the alteration of the gauge between Dublin and Kingstown is being rapidly proceeded with, and that, so soon as it is completed, and an uniform gauge etblished throughout, an iLncrease in the traffic receipts over the Kingstown line may confidently be expected. With reference to the subject of the dlirectors' remuneration, it is stated that the usual charge of 4001. has been made for the half-year ending the 31st of August last, but for the following half-year, and for the future, it is considered that200Z. per aunum wil be a proper amount. Of the sum now available for distribution-namely, 12,337Z., the Board declare a dividend for the half-year of 4 per cent., free of income-tax, 'on the paid up capital of 305,000l., amounting to 12,2001., and carr; forward the balance of 1571. to the next account.

The works on this line are regressing in satisfactory manner, and it is expected that the first division, ta
Borris, will be opened for traffic in the course of the present 3 ear.
RAILWAYS IN INDIA.
iUeutenant-Colonel Kennedy, in a report to the shareholders of the Bombay and Baroda Railway Company, calls attention to the advantages of a judicious mode of proceeding in carrying out railway undertakings, particarly in India. He complains of the delays to which the company has been subjected in carrying out the construction of a line from Bombay to Baroda and Ahmedabad, a length of 335 miles, which might have been completed in two years, under the judicious arrangements sanctioned by the direc tors of the company, and approved by the local authorities in India; but, owing to a decisionofthe Home Government
the constraction of the best portion of the line from Bombay to Baroda, 180 miles in length, is to be delayed until after the section from Baroda or barat to Ahmedabad, 155 miles in length, is completed for trudie. The disadvantages of this course, in a commercipl point of view, are shown. The longer the works are kept on hand the larger will be the amount of debt against the company in the shape of interest, and the cost of the railway to the Government will be increased in proportion. If the company had been allowed to uroceed with the hole line from Bombay to Ahmedabad (3X5 miles), it could have been completed in two or three years, and the charge for interest would have been paid off out of a moiety of the surplus earnings above five per cent in the course of three or oar years from the opening of the line, which is estimated not to exceed a cost of 6,0001. & mile, including working stock and everything. He compares the position of India, having an enormous population, fertile cultivated lands, valuable natural productions, fine archhitectural cities, and manufacturing communities, and the rental of the lands 'dowing into the treasury as public revenue, with that of A merica in 1782, wvhich wabs destitute of everything except expanse of waste territory and energ in the small poulation, The latter bad advanced to great commercial rank in the world, while India had remained pretty nearly in the same positiou as when posion of it was obtained. He contrasts the progress m de bjIndia and the United States of America as exhibited in the cotton trade carried on between England and those countries retpectively. The returns show that England imported in 1820 from Aierica 89,999,1741b. of slave-grown raw cotton, and from India 23,125,8251b. of free-grown raw cotton -asid in 1855, from America, 681,629,4241b. of slave-grownrawcotton, and from India 145,179,2661b., showing an increase of 591,630,251b. in the weight of cotton imported from America, and of 122,053,441b. imported from India, or about one-fifth of the American increase England in 1820 exported to America manufactured cotton to the value of 1,194,531Z, and to India to the value of 850 9061 . while England in 1855 exportedto America manufactured cotton to the value of 3,649,8621., and to India to the value of 6,532,459L, showing an increase in the value of manufactured cotton experted to America of 2,455,3311, and in the value exported to India of 5,681,5481., or more than double the increased purchases made from England by the American.States. He remarks that cotton wool a staple produce of India, is purchased from the slave-owner in America, brought to Manchester for manufacture, and thence sent to India for sale. It was impossible for Indian producers to compete with American producers owing to thej Indian Government withholding from their subjects railway communication, which the American Government sought with all its power to supply. The first locomotive engine exhibited on the Manchester Tailway, in 1830, was the signal at once responded to throughout England and the United States; and before the first sod for an " experimental line" was cut inIndia there were 6,000 miles of railway open in England, and 8,858 in the United States of America. At present the length of railway opened for traffic in England is 8,297, in India 358 miles, and in the United States of America 26,000miles. The measures taken for the extension of railways in the United States of America are calculated to insure an annual increase of 2,000 miles, till the aggregate mileage shall have reached 35,000 miles. The value of British iron exported to the United States in nine years, from 1847 to 1855 inclusive, amounted to 27,155,1531., and from England to India in the same period since the commencement of railway construction there 3,840,230l He states that 8,000 miles of railway constructed on well selected lines in India, although far short of the ultimate requirement, would place that country in a very different commercial position from that which she at present occupies, and this might be effected in four years, for an investment of 48,000,000M, which ought under proper arrangements to give a return of 10 per cent. unon the outlay. The net rent of the land, now exceeding 13,000,000.a-year, goeg to theGovernmentofIndia; in other countries the rent goes to land proprietors, from which class spring various capitalists. He maintains that the Government as the sole land proprietor there ought to execute the duties as weU as enjoy the privileges of the three classes it represents,-viz., Government, land proprietor, and capitalist. 8,000 miles of railway, costing 6,0001 per mile would only charge the land revenue to the extent of 2,400,0001. annually, or under one-fifth of the present rent, supposing the entire dividends to be disbursed by Govern. ment; but that if a judicious and rapid principle of construction were adoyted the guarantee would Ie merely nominal. The pub c revenue would improve, and the industry of 152,000,000 of subjects would be promoted. He concludes by stating that the establishment of a just and energetic Government of India, having as a chief object the developement of her vast industrial resources, ought to be the firs; question of British policy. The commercial and trading communities of England would readily understand how such a developement would act and react on their home industry, incomparably beyond all the other subjects that could possibly be imagined, and that it was difficult to overestimate the enormous effect upon home produce of transforming 152,000,000 of miserably poor customers rapidly into rich ones.

The receipts of English wbeat were 6,534 quarter., and 7,871 quarters of foreign. The morning's show from Kent and Essex was moderate, with the condition slightly improved. A few picked parcels cormanded last week', rates, but the bnlk was generally neglected, though lower terms would have been ccepted. In foreign very little was passing, there being some disposition to take leas money on inf.rior qualities.
The quantity of flour was 19,03S sacks from the country, with 4,347 barrels and 193 sacks foreign. Norfolks and the lower descriptions of American were somewhat in buyers' favour, Lthe former being offered at 40s. per sack. Townmade samples unchanged.
English barley amounted to 3,222 quarters; foreign to 14,799 quarters. The whole trade was dull, and the best samples ls. per quarter cheaper.
Oats were plentiful, the total quantity being 30,700 quarters; of these 25,277 were foreign, 4,228 Irish, and the remainder British. Sales were generally made at 6d. per quarter legs money, and some inferior parcels were is. cheaper.
The supply of foreign beans was large-viz., 3,293 quarters, with 1,189 quarters of home growth. Business was slow, and English samples rather in buyes' favour.
Of peas there were 335 quarters of native and 370 quarters foreign, with a limited inquiry. There was no change in prices.
The linseed supply was 5,244 quarters. The trade was quiet, both in seed and cakes, without any quotable difference in prices. The cloverseed trade being past its height, red seed was dull, and inclining downwards. White was 2g. to 3s. lower. Trefoil very slow sale. Tares 2s. per quarter cheaper, and in very little demand. lHempseed, canary, and other eed unaltered.

The Murrain.
THE AMURRArIv.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Permit me again to call attention to the approaehing murrain. For this disease there is confessedly no remedythe mortality is computed at 90 per cent. Happily agalnsl it there is a simple and efficient preventive. It is only to put a stop to the importation of cattle into your country_ Such a measure could have lit-le effect on prices, as foreigia cattle supply no more than one or two per cent. of your consumption.
The ultimate effect of its introduction in raising prices may be estimated from the dearness It caused in Englan& dcuringthe continuance and forlong afterthesubsidenceof the murrain in 1745. In Russia the mere anticipation of it has already raised very considerably the price of tallow. SuchL
was the scarcity of cattle arising from its rarages in the. Venetian States in the middle of the last century that orn its disappearauce their Senate forbade for three years the Flaughter of calves and cowrs. In England, as well as also in
Ireland, in 685, it caused such a famine as was said to haveL driven the people to the very vergo of cannibalism. It will be seen that it thus becomes a subject of vital importance to. the consumer as well as the agriculturist.
In an able article on the subject publisbed some timeo since in the GazxU Mcdicalc de Paris the wrriter, Dr.. Bornet, says that in effoct there is no cure for it, and concludes by felicitating Englxnd on its insular position as X security against its introduction, he never, of course, aticipating that when occasion arose, as it now has, our Government would prove so apathetic in availing themselves of this providential advantage, and this in the face. of the elaborate precautions now being so carefully organize 1 by continental Governments.
The caution on the subject to the Customs' officers is . mere State trick to shelve an alarming and embarrassing question. Surely a man of such promptitude, energy, and determination as our Premier will no longer practicallr ignore so important a question.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant.
S. CASWELL.

niently deprive it. Thege advantages will be tuncied to account by a comnpany combining the pregtige of acknowledged genius with attraction of newy candidates for the highest rank of their profeesion. Those who last teair woni fav-our at the hands of strangers will reappear to claim the cordial recognitionx which an English audience never refuses to established favouciles; and the direction has teens further strengthened by an accession of new a3pirants of the highest (,rder. whose merits ore alresdy acknowledged on the stagea of Italy. and who only wait the verdict of the saubecnibers and frequenters of Her Majesty's Theatre to confirm their fame. Although In an esftablish. rment espiecially devoted to Italian Opera the oomoositione of Italy will naturally predominate, the gems of other echools wlil not be neglecedl. Ballet will continue to be supporttd by the meet famous of established artistest and the meet promisng of those who are amnbitious of the cameo distinction.

LONDON, TUESDAY, MARCH 24,1857.
What are we to do with Mr. Roanuci ? He places us in a sad dilemma, between humanity and truth. Some time since there was an advertise. ment of a nondescript animal, which the exhibitors announced as " What is it ?" A naturalist rushed to the place that very morning, and under a bearskin easily recognized the singular form and odd movements of a very old acquaintance. It -was a poor fellow whose arms were so long, his body so bent, and his legs so short, that he could touch the ground standing upright, walk on his hands, and do all sorts of absurd tricks. He had got his bread by doing imps, baboons, devils, satyrs, and even a Stoic philosopher on the stage. While the poor creature was mouthing and frisldng before his shilling spectators on the morning in question he saw, by the scrutinizing glance of one of them, that he was detected ; so, tumbling and jumping up to him, he whispered, " Don't " peach on a poor feUow. It can't signify " what they thinla I am." tWhat was to be done?
In this case wo reaUy think we should have let the world remain under the impression that Nature was even more given to vagaries than she has usually credit for. The 'wretch of a naturalist, however, with that slavery to truth and that brutal devotion to science wlhich characterize the whole tribe, rushed home to his desk, and sent us a most malignant exposure of the hannless imposition. We knew, of course, that if we did not publish it another paper would, and it was this consideration, not any particular regard for the interests of science, that led us to give the world an answer to " What is it ' The poor clown had to go back to his garret, and pay for his bearskin as well as he could, we believe by the sale of his own body to the surgeons. iNow, what can it signify to the artisans of Sheffield what Mr. RovBucoK is ? Why should they not live and die under the innocent persuasion that he is a MToN, a Buuxz, and a Fox all in one, and nevertheless not at all vain, like Sir JoRy BowRING,-no, not at all? Why should they not be left to suppose that the Cantonese are rather a fine sort of people,-particularly like the people of Sheffield, and that it is a great honour to the latter to be associated with the former in Mr. ROEBucK's good opinions and affectionate regards ? Unfortunately, the delusion cannot last long. Bearskins and lion-skins are sure to betray themselves, and if we wished to be hamane it would only be a shortsighted kindness. The timo will come when the artisans will find that they have been imposed upon, that this Chinese affair is not an American war, or a French war, much less a war against liberty, justicc, and truth, and that it so happens we have the Americans, the French, all Europe, except R: - ., and, with the exception of a fewr crotchety n. all lovers of liberty, justice, and truth, oi, 'Ur si of the quarrel.
It is a misfortune that attends grcal causes and illustrious examples that they are followed by base imitatiMns. Every libeller writes his Philippics, '-d every -mouthing declaimer is a CATHnAs or a BUnxE. Thlere is no cause so worthless but,
v the aid of a g6od memory and a copious vocabUlary, it may be sw ollen to a rivalry with mankind's grandest struggles. The test of such pretences is when you deseend from the high and airy region of platitudes to men and things. The whole of Mr. REoB7ucE's position, and every word of his speech, are a harsh, grinding collision, with facts and realities. At Sheffield he confesses " an absence of familiar faces, men who thought "they were his friends on public grounds, and
"who forget a life of service in consequence of " one vote. le won't believe them. He believes " the ' accident' was sought for, that they endea"voured to find a cause of complaint, and that "they were glad to find one." Why, this is turning things inside out with a vengeance. Whose doing was the " vote P" Who procured the " acei" dent!" Who "forgot a life service?" Who were "glad to find a cause of complaint?" The " fortuitous concourse of atoms" having denied the charge of conspiracy, now charges aU the rest of the world with malice prepense, because they will not join what is not a conspiracy. But it devolves on the atoms to show cause why others should join them. If there is a conspiracy it may be a good one, and there may be good reasons for a general adhesion. But, if there is no conspiracy, the rest of the world may be left to pursue its own course, and leave the " concourse" alone. It appears, then, from Mr. RozBucxi's own speech, that there are people at Sheffield-good naturalists we suppose-who are not taken in by a new integument and outlandish gestures. Mr. RonBuox having done his very best to throw out a Liberal Government, at least having taken the course most conducive to this result, is astonished to find that there are gentlemen at Sheffield who stick tlo the Liberal Government, and not to the seceding individual. Those gentlemen have, it seems to us, much more right and common sense on their side than even Mr. ItEusoxc's friend, Mr. Commissioner YEr. They find a stray lorcha, not only without a Liberal flag, but in a state of angry revolt against it, and doing it considerable damage and dishonour. So they conclude it not to be Liberal, and treat it accordingly.
But Mr. RoLmuox, besides his little difficulty with Government, and another with the gentlemen of Sheffield, has also one more to make up with the electors generally. He has to start with telling them that they know nothing about international law, and that he can enlighten them. If we
are to judge from the attempt before us, 1 any sensible artisan of Sheffield who has not a bee in his bonnet knows more about international law than Mr. ROEsucE. The arLtisan has only to be aware that international law, like all other law, aims to work out the dictates of humanity and plain common sense, and he is much better prepared for this question than Mr. Ro1znuox with his budget of quirks and quibbles. The Arrow was no more a Chinese vessel than a Sheffield knife and fork are a pair of Chinese chopsticks. Its make alone proclaimed it a foreigner. It was notoriously in the British trade; it had long been employed in the British trade; it had the fullest credit with all the Chinese as being in the British trade; it was believed by them to be used as such for carrying on a freeer trade than the Chinese officials liked, and for sheltering natives from the frightful massacres going on every day in the province of Canton. It had British papers on board, though the register happened-a matter not of the least consequence-to have expired a few days. It had a British flag flying, which the Mandarin not only saw but tore down. It had a British captain; and this fact Mr. ROEBUCK is reduced to slur over by a shift which must have made every inch of his skin creep as he gave it utterance. " When boarded " no Englishman was on board." We can only cry " Shame" on the man whe, sticking himself up by the side of MaTox, BuRax, and Fox, protesting in behalf of humanity, justice, and all other high principles, and, above all, affecting to be an authority on international law, tells a crowd of British artisans that a ruthless barbarian may board a vessel notoriously employed in the British trade, and with a British flag and British papers on board, and, in spito of all remonstrances, carry
away the crew, for the purpose of cutting off as many heads, and on such pretences, as he may please, if only, just at the instant of his boarding, the British captain is not actually on board. The British captain was saying "Good bye" to the captain of another lorcha not fifty yards from his own, and was pointed out to the Mandarin by. his own crew. In the eyes not only of all the British and other foreigners, but of the whole native population, this was a British vessel, as between us and the Chinese authorities. This was all that the treaty required. Yet'31r. RoEBUcK goes ilnto the question of the Colonial Ordinance, its confirmation by the Rome Government, the precise date of the register, and all the rest, as if that really affected the case of a violent and deliberate outrage on a vessel employed in the British trade and notoriously under British protection. M1r. Roiwucx, indeed, is aware that a question of national honour, opeuly outraged, is not to be disposed of by technicalities; so he attempts to give his position a more genial-a sort of rollicking air, by a course which is really suicidal. He tries to exalt YzH into a sort of hero, lawlessly independent, jovially trampling on
the obigations' of a tfreat, iiqtth out
foreigners, partly from patriotism, partly for the "'lar]2' of the thing, and pandering to the passions of a peculiarly ferocious populace, whom he compliments his constituency by comparing to them. All this may be amusing, but it is not the way to prove the Chinese in the right ana ourselves in the wrong. For fifteen years we have tamely endured every injustice and insult, while the Chinese have gone on insulting us more and more, evidently aiming to get rid of the whole treaty. When at last their continual aggressions and insolence, and our patience, have ended, as of course they could only end, in a collision, Mr. Roznmucx takes their lide, and that particularly on the ground that they have all along been doing wrong with a high hand, and are a set of fine fellows for doing so. We beg to ask, in reply to aU this stuff, whether the people of Sheffield are Englishmen or Chinese?
Having taken Yrir s aide expresly because he is a lawless savage, and having thrown himself into the cause of the Cantonese because they are exclusive, ignorant, and brutal,-having also taken no notice of the fact that YEn'S pretence for seizing the crew of a British vessel was thlt he might cut off a man's head for something another man had done ;-in a word, having palliated every atrocity on the side of the Chinese, Mr. ROEBUCK shows his admirable qualifications for an argument on internation3l law by giving a proportionately false colouring to what we have done. So he talks of our "atrocities,"-a peaceful city as large as London blazing and burning,-shells fired into it from the fleet of England,-her great name pr' s.uted to such direful craelty, and theTi, he says, his heart could not have been in
t.H rightqplace if, in the name of his constituency, 2 3 had sanctioned such a thing. The particular position of Mr. RoEBucK's heart is not a matter of great national importance. It may, for aught we know, be in the place which RICBAnD II. is supposed to have indicated to the traitor BOLuxGBsnOKE .-
"Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,
"Thus high at least, although your knee be low."
But the organ itself must be not only misplaced, but entirely gone, or converted into guttapercha or soft soap, to turn the tables on Old England in this fashion. Whatever was done in the way of burning was by a very humane British gentleman, who has not the misfortune to be the intimate friend of Mr. COBDEN. It was all done with the utmost consideration and humanity by Admiral Sir M. SmtvfouR. On the refusal of a just demand he put a shell once a quarthrx of an hour into the residence and grounds of 3Ir. Comnmissioner YEH, who for a long time past has spent so much of his time at the Execution-ground, sawing heads off at the rate of 400 per diem, that he could hardly be aware of the interruption. The burning was confined to some streets of wooden and bamboo sheds, from which the inhabitants were warned by proclamation, and which it was necessary to clear away for the safety of the Admiral's position on the river. This is the whole of the affair which has set Mr. RosRuOK feeling about to see whether his heart is in the right place. We can only say that if the electors of Sheffield are Englishmen he is not in his right place there, or anywhere else, except at the right hand of his hero, Commissioner YxF.
The last official act of President PIERCE will
The last official act of President P=cz will perhaps, in the opinion of posterity, cast a relieving ray over the career of a confessedly unsuccessful magistrate. Before quitting office he gave his assent to the new Tariff Bill of the UTnited States. Thus, some ten or twelve years after ourselves, the Americans have taken one step in the direction of Free Trade. Not that the new Tariff goes very far, for stiU nearly the whole of the revenue wiU be raised by duties paid on imports; but the principle is admitted that these duties are imposed for the sake of revenue, and, not of Protection; and we may expect that, as the population and wealth of the Republic increase, and the Treasury becomes more unnecessarily rich, the charges wiU be further reduced. The financial history of the United States is simple enough. A new country, with a thin and spreading, but well-to-do population, must raise revenue by indirect taxation. On the one hand, the race of farmers and traffickers who overspread the country have generaUy more than a sufficiency of the necessaries of life, and can afford to pay a fair price for luxuries-for coffee, sugar, wine, and spirits-and even for what may be caUed semi-necessaries, such as foreign woollens and silks. There is no peasantry, there is no clmss which can be considered ill-used in being called on to contribute to the necessities of the State. In the case of America, a few Custom-house officers at some dozen ports can levy duties on produce which is to be distributed over an immense continent, and the tax is paid by the prosperous consumer without being ever felt. On the other hand, direct taxation is almost imnpossible. Who is to reach the backwoodsman in his hut, or ask the dweller on the prairies the amount of his income? Very small collections and very frequent " difficulties" would follow any attempt to send the taxgatherer into Wisconsin or Minresota. So, with the consent of every one, a system of taxation theoretically imperfect, but practically effective, has grown up, and probably wil continue to flourish. By duties on imports every one is taxed according to the scale on which he lives, and the community is too fresh, too vigorous, too weeU supplied with the materials of prosperity, to feel any injury from the warping and cramping of the national industry which are the results of Protection. An old thickly populated country like our own is obliged to fit its conduct as nearly as possible to the rule of theoretical right ; but, as a young man is able to disregard valetudinarian precepts which his elders cannot, so America. with a population in a more primitive state, and with a boundless territory, may disobey the strict rules of political economy, while in the artificial society of England a scientific error may destroy the prosperity of entire classes.
While, therefore, North America still remains only sparsely peopled, while the pioneers of civilization can still talk of the Far West, we are not likely to see the present system of taxation greatly changed. But the Eastern States are now assuming something of the character of Europe, and it is necessary to adapt legislation to this fact. People are calling out for cheaper iron and wool, cheaper liquors, cheaper clothing. Happily, the increasing income and few wants of the State allow this demand to be gratified; and the Statesmen of the Union have also become aware that the diminution of a duty does by no means entail a diminution of the retun. Consequently, the new Tariff Bil provides for a regular reduction of all the duties now paid. Imported commodities in the United States pay ad valorem duties varying from 100 per cent. down to 5 per cent. These duties are now systematically reduced. Spirits used to pay 100 per cent.; this charge is reduced to 70 per cent. As the population of the United States is spirit-drinking and not beer-drinking, this change will effect a considerable diminution in the price of articles of almost universal consumption. The duty on iron is reduced only from 30 to 24 per cent. This we cannot help thinking a very inadequate reform, both as regards the principle of Free Trade and the interests of the revenue. One of the chief wants of America is cheap and good iron for railways and other works. The interests of a rapidly improving country aiid expanding population'
quire that no obtacle should be placed in the way of those great enterprises in which iron is the chief material; yet, that the American ironworkers may be protected, the citi7ens are content to put up with their own dear and bad iron, and to keep out ours by a duty of 24 per cent. There can be little doubt that, with a small duty on foreign metal, America vwould gain by the greater economy of constructing public works, while the revenue, buoyed up by the increased importation, would xuffer nothing.
The duty on woollens is similarly reduced from 30 to 24 per cent. In a country where the extremes of heat and cold are so great-where the thermometer, in fact, ranges over 120 degreeswoollen clothing in abundance is a necessity. America is a country of rheumatism ana ague, and should above every other facilitate the importation of warm, well-woven clothing; yet, to support a few sickly manufactures, the duty on most articles of the kind is kept up to 24 per cent.,-a tax sufficient to keep out the free competition of the English factories, to make clothes dear to the rich, and unattainable in sufficient quantities by the very poor. Well may a New York newspaper hope that the nation will be soon " emancipated from the taxation of the manu" facturers." In the case of wines and spirits, however, Congress has been more liberal. Nothing can be worse than the liquids sold in the States as French and Spanish wines at an enormous price. The reduction of duty will enable a population which has a decided taste for the luxuiics of life to gratify itself with cheaper and more wholesome beverages.
On the whole, though this tariff has not been passed avowedly on Free-trade principles, yet it is no doubt a great victory for them. The public of the United States begin now to taLk of breaking down the manufacturing monopolies. The spirit of Protection is deeply infused into the hearts of all those who have profited by it. In England it was the landlord and the farmer; the cause was an aristocratic cause, and its assailants were manufacturers, strongly attached to democratic opinions. But in no other country is the agriculturist sufficiently powerful to be a Protectionist. France is in this respect in the same position as America. In both countries the same trades raise the same cry of "Protec" tion to manufacturing industry." The ironmasters of France are as jealous of foreign competition as their brethren in Pennsylvania and Tennessee. Euglish broadeloths are even still more rigidly excluded from French ports than from American. The Continental States have, indeed, wished to raise up a school of economists who should assert the necessity of developing manufacturing industry by a system of favouritism. Absolute Russia and Democratic America have both acquiesced hitherto in the same arguments. But it seems that this time is to pass away. A country like the United States cannot remain long uninfluenced by financial doctrines which bear the stamp of truth. Some months since we noticed the first glimmerings of commercial reform in France. Free Trade was not to be inaugurated, but faintly, hesitatingly, timidly the principle of Protection was to be substituted for the principle of absolute exclusion. It had been found that the bare name of free competition had created a panic among the bourgeoisie, which is one of the chief aupports of the Imperial throne. On one pretext or another the scheme for something like comprehensive reform was abandoned, and a modified plan substituted. But America is rather more advanced than this. The necessity of raising the revenue by indirect taxation may be felt, but there is also a conviction that the interests of a vast and permanently settled population require the application of true principles of political economy. We may, then, hope to see the gradual development of that free system towards which the new Tariff represents the state of transition.
This is the 24th of March, 1857. Men can go
This is the 24th of March, 1857. MIen can go to New York in 1 0 days, and communicate with Constantinople in 20 minutes. In the opinion of everybody but the Chinese and the Por, we pass for a very civilized and enlightened people, rather too "go-ahead" perhaps in our notions, but decidedly exempt from any incubus of superstition or credulity. We are all for education, too. Schools of every description and denomination are sprinloed over the country, and the cry is still for more, untl the national instruction question has become one of the topics of the day, like the Inoome-tax and the affair at Canton. Yet on this very day, of this very year, turns up a real trial for Witchcraft I-not, indeed, an actual arraignmnent for the practice of the black art, but a ease showing as plainly as need be that aU our teaching has not been able to eradicate the delusions of two centuries back. At Stafford last week a man was put upon his trial, not for bewitching another, but for undertaking to remove an existing spell in consideration of money payment, and the state of things implied by such a case was further illustrated by the attendance in court, as our report assures us, of a " considerable niunber of witches," who were anxious, no doubt, about a cause so directly affecting the interests of their profession.
THomAs CHARLESWORTH, now in the 29th year of his age, owns and occupies a farm of 40 acres in the county of Stafford, and pursues the ordinary bv siness of his caling in those parts. In April last year he found that something ailed the milk, that things went wrong in the dairy, that the cheese wouldn't " come," and that the dairymaid was ilL For these facts he seems to have been at a loss to account, until a man upon his farm suggested that there was Witchcraft at work, and that a certain JAMES TuNNIcLIFF was the man to stop it. So to J,MiFS Tuxxicx.Fr he repaired, who at once accepted the office, and proceeded to the farm, where, after a few preliminary essays, he presently established himself. The end of it was, that there he remained in the capacity of exorcist till February last, when he was dismissed, but not before he had received for his services some 201. or 301. from the said THOxAS CH.&RLEswoxTH, who, now in his better senses, became prosecutor on aecount thereof. We have only to add that a sentence of 12 months' hard labour followed upon the conviction of the prisoner, and we shall have said aU that is necessary respecting the trial. The incidents, however, deserve a further notice, for it is not every day that we are adnitted into the secrets of the art and practice of Witcheraft as pursued in the current century.
The symptoms of a bewitched family still exhibit a strong family resemblanco to those put fornierly on record. At Bromley Hurst Farm things drove in to the yard like carriage3, and other things came into the passages like the sind. The household was alarmed by " a " many strange noises," the cows " lamented," the horses pranced; and the dog howled, after which, on one occasion, about 3 a.m., there was " something " louder than the dog." At another time there was a more palpable apparition, a phantom resembling the dreaded Manx dog described by Sir WALTE
Scou in Peveril of the Peak. The regular house terrier rushed in one night, and after it was "the " shape of anotber dog all on fire," which ran through a closed door, and then vanished, though without any smell of brimstone, as on crossexamination was acknowledged. The creature most impressed on this occasion was the origiual. animal, which, after the disappearance of his double in this remarkable way, took up hi5 sttat b3hind the door aud put his tongue out to iuch
a purpose that it seemed, as the witness depoA-e"a quarter of ayard long."
The office of JAmZS TNICLrPF, the witchdoctor-the champion of society against the dealings of the Devil-was to remove these spells and defend the house from the visitations. In this he' described himself as suffering cruelly from the severity of the battle. Every reader will recollect the affecting story in the Arabian Kights where the Lady of Beauty in attempting to restore to his natural shape a Prince bewitched by a Genie, the son of a daughter of EFuIS, combats her antagonist in the successive shapes of a lion, a scorpion, an eagle, a cat, a worm, a gourd, and a fish, but is herself reduced to ashes in the moment of victory. The conflicts of JA3mS TNxxricrFF with his adversaries were scarcely less terrible, though a good deal more remunerative. Wizard after wizard was specified as being the author of the mischief prevailing, and was encounteredaccordinglybythewitch-doctor, sometimes face to face, sometimes, after the manner of such struggles, through conjurations operating at a distance. One contest was very stubborn, but TUIMxcTrFF undertook to floor his man "in three " days." On another night he had a most desperate bout. Going into a room by himself, he observed, it "would be either death or glory to " him," and when he came out again, although, as he announced, victorious, " there was a blueness " over him." His implements in this g,rapple with the powers of darkness were " a knife and plate"and if a fork and a mutton-chop had been added the selection would not have been a bad one.
When he first came into CHARLEsWORTIMS house
upon his errand of relief he pronounced inco ' nently that al the cows (27 in number) were bewitched, as also two horses, their proprietor, his wife, the dairymaid, and the cheese-kettle,-a pretty good account, we should think, of the entire establishment. In the case of the kettle and the cows the diagnosis was achieved without sight of the patients, and by intuition alone. The fees asked for a cure were 3s. Gd. per cow, and 5s. each for the maid, kettle, and master of the house. The mistress was pronounced but imperfectly bewitched, and her restoration, it was said, could be accomplished by " taking one bit out of her dress." Altogether some Gl. or71. passed on this occasion. Shortly afterwards the whole stock of the farm was reported to be under spells, and this time the charge, Owing to the number of patients, fell rather heavily. Fifty sheep, 12 stirks, 11 calves, and 12 pigs (the latter at 3s. Gd. per head) had to be paid for, in addition to which a crown-piece was put down for the baby. Notwithstanding these investments, things still went wrong, and the master and mistress continued to demean themselves as bewitched from April, 1856, till February, 1857, when the prisoner, in the exercise of some sudden flash of reason, 'was sent about his more legitimate business. The sharpest character in the drama appears to have been a maid servant, who gave the witch-doctor "a bit of her mind" -doubtless with al the point, frankness, and simplicity usuaUy observed in such deliveries.
Wel, on the eve of a great constitutional appeal to the intelligence of the country it is certainly rather awkward to find such an exhibition as that detailed above, but the exposure itself ought to do a little good. One point taken in the defence was curious. A false pretence was charged in the indictment; but the law holds that the false pretence mnst be a pretence of an existing fact. Now, Witchcraft is not an existing fact, either in reality, or, wvhat is more, in law. It is recognized in law, urged the prisoner's counsel, " that Witchcraft could not exist," and therefore there was no such a foundation of truth as would give the pretence the proper quality of falsity. By the side, however, of this very reasonable recognition we have here obtained only too sufficient proof that the belief in the practice exists still, and exist it niust, we suppose, as long as the propensity of the human mind to mystery and terror remains uncorrected by wholesome education. That this good work has not yet proceeded too far we need scarcely stop to argue in the face of so practical a display of its shortcomings. The Privy Council may still fight against Witchcraft, though we are no longer in the days of King JAMES, nor need anybody suppose that the Committee of Education will have too much leisure after the spectacle at Stafford, and the popular delusions which it implies.
Lord PALMERSTON'S Address to the consti-
Lord PALIMEISTON'S Address to the constituency of Tiverton is now before the public. As might have been expected, this document contains in a few pithy sentences the essence of that, policy which for some time past has been accepted by the coluntry as calculated to promote the honour and security of England. Within the last few weeks this policy has been marked by the disapprobation of a majority in the House of Commons, although it might be as well not to inquire too curiously into the constitution of the body which has rendered an appeal to the country inevitable. During the last two years we have so frequently expressed our opinions upon the important matters contained in Lord PAsrErRo?TN'S Address that it would be superfluous for us to enter upon the discussion of them here at any length. We would simply ask,-Is it not true that the question now before the constituencies for solution is substantially whether the administrative power of the country shall be left in the hands of Lord PALNrERsToN and his colleagues until they have disentitled themselves to our confidence, or whether it shall be transferred to one or other of those snmall sections of politicians who could not retain office even if it were offered them, and who are knowvn to us but by the failure of all they have undertaken to perform ? Is it not true that the events of the last two years will foru no inglorious chapter in the history of England ? Is it not true that the present Premier and his colleagues undertook the conduct of the war at a time when the hearts of many waxed faint, and the courage of the bold speakers of the last three weeks ran very low ? As Lord PALMERSTON puts it to the electors of Tiverton, " The leaders of parties had for
various reasons declined the responsibility "of office, or had been unable to form such an "Administration as was in their opinion equal "to the crisis." Is it not true that under the auspices of the present Administration a satisfactory peace was secured ? When difficulties as to the subsequent executionl of that treaty arose those difficulties were removed; when the peace was finally concluded, and all difficulties were at an end, every effort was made to replace the financial establishments and military arrangements of the country upon a peace/ footing. In all this where was the nmistake T Where was the reason for getting rid of j Minister who had done the country ch good service ? Lord PAisImsTow, moreover, Ind his colleagues settled the differences which iad unfortunately arisen between this country an the United States in a manner which leaves little basis for the assertion that his policy has been one of universal aggression against foreign nations. -r'
After all, however, it is the Chinesa war .uponx which the Coalition, or rather the foruihtous con-* junction of parties, have taken issue, unf unately for themselves, and upon this point th country mnst pronounce the verdict. The decisioo may be left very confidently in the hands of i Dation jealo;as of its honxonr, andaresolved- to 'reserv t3 lives and property of its citizens In aiill ter3 dike glol2e.
Lord Palmerston And His Constituents.
XORD PALMERSTON AND HIS
CONSTITUENTS.
TO TME ELECTORS OF TTVPRThTm'
Gentlemen,-Parliament having been dissolved in order 'that the elootors of the united kingdom may have i.n opportunity of expreesing their opinion on the existing state of public affAIs, I present myself to you as a candidate for the 'continuance of that confidence with wvucb, as your repreSontative, I have so long been honoured.
The question which is submitted to the judgment of the -country is which shall be the men to whose hands shall be committed the destinies of the nation, and whether that -charge shall continue to be confided to the present Administration, or whether it shall be transferred to that aggrega. tion of hitherto discordant elements by whose combined -action on a late occasion a vote of cenisure was passed upon Her Majesty's Government.
The claims of the present Administration to the confidence ,0 the country rest upon facts and events which will form =n important chapter in the history of these times.
We undertook the conduct of affairs, in obedience to the tall of our Sovereign, at a moment of no small difficulty, in the midst of a great war, and whea thoeo men who had .heretofore been looked up to as the leaders of parties had for various reasons declined tho responsibility of office, or had been unable to form such au Administration as wa; in their opinion equal to the crisis. We carried on with energy and vigour tho war in which the country wai LnogaeOd, and in hearty co-operation with our gallant allies -the French, the Sardinians, and the Turks-wo brought t to a succe^sful termination, and the result was a treaty of oea¢o which accomplished the objects of the war, and which secured for the allies conditions which some of those to wbom I have allUded had deemed it unreasonable to propose and impossible to obtain.
In the execution of the stipulations of this treaty diffiunulties in regard to matters of great importance arose, those difficulties by firmness in negotiation Her Majesty's OGveeinment mainly contributed in a satisfactory manner to remove, and the full attainment of the objects of the treaty in regard to the matters in which those difficultie, related has thus been secured.
At the beginning of the recent session of Parliament we announced our intention of taking off the war portion -of the income-tax, and we proposed a budget which wa, approved by a majority of go votes.
The Persian war, which had originated in aggressionsand breach of engagement by the Persian Government, was put an end to by a treaty of peace concluded at Paris. Oar diplomatic relations with the United States had been replaced Upon their usnal footing by the appointment of Lord Napier and his departure for Washington.
Papers had been presented to Parliament explaining the reasons why the British and French missions had been withdrawn from Naples, and no notice had been given of any motion to be founded on those papers.
'Upon none of these matters did the Opposition deem it Tossible to found any successful attack on the Government.
But events of much importance had happened in China, unforeseen by Her Majesty's Government, and not the consequence of any steps taken by them.
An insolent barbarian wielding authority at Canton had violated the British flag, broken the engagements of treaties, 'offered rewards for the headsof British subjectsni that pars Of China, and planned their destruction by murder, assassi. nation, and poisons.
The British officers, civil and naval, on the station had taken those measures which appeared to them to be proper -and necessary to obtain satisfaction and redress, and Her Majesty's Government had approved the course pursued by thos officers in vindication of the national honour and for the assertion of our national rights. A combination of poli-ical parties, uot till this last session united, carried a resolution declaring the course pursued by our officers in China unjustifiable, and consequently censuring Her Majesty's Government for having approved that course.
Bat if that course was unjustifiable the British Govern2nent, instead of demanding an apology, ought to make one and instead of expecting satisfaction ought to offer compen. sation to the Chinese Commissioner, and this courEe the combined opponents of the Government, if their Parliamnentary victory had installed them in office, must in consistency have been prepared to pursue.
Will the British nation give their support to men who bave thus endeavoured to make the humiliation and degradation of their country the stepping-stone to power 2
I confidently assert that sueb will not be the answer that *Mll be given to the appeal now made to the electors of the United kingdom.
We offer to the country a Government founded upon far different principles. Abroad it will be: our earnest endea'.our to procure peaeo, but peace with honour and with safety, Peace with the maintenance of national rights, peace with security to our fellow-countrymen in foreiga lands. At home our guiding principles vWill be judiious and well-regulated economy, progressive improvement in all that con. eorns the welfare of the nation, the continued diffusion of education among the people, and such well-considered reforms as from time to time may be required by changes of circumstances and by the increasing growth of intel. ligence.
On these grounds I present myself to you, and I anticipate with cnfidence the result of the share which you are -about to take in the solemn decision which the constituen. eies of the united kingdom are about to pronounce.
I have the honoar to bo, gentlemen, yoar obedient and devoted servant, PALMEBSTON.

Destructive Fire In The Strand.
DESTRUCTIVE FIRE IN THE STRAND.
Last night a fire broke out, *hortly before 9 o'clock, in the Strand, near Temple-bar, which was not extinguished until midnight.
The place where the fire broke out was the warehouse of Messrs. Watkiuson, upholsterers, 227, Strand. The house, which ran back to the depth of the Temple, was situated at ,an equal distance between Thanet and PaLIgrave places, to neither of which is there any thoroughfare. On the western side of Messrs. Watkinson's, and leading to Palsgraveplace, are situated the shops of Mr. Lane, grocer; Mr. Fraser, Alton ale dealer; and Mr. Cogswell, gunmaker. On the eastern side, and adjoining Thanet-place, were Mr. Brown's dining.rooms; Mr. Prout, the patent medicine vendor; Air. IManby's warehouse; and Messrs. Cording's waterproof warehouse. The whole of theseformed one occupied mass of buildings,the backs of oneside of the housesinPalsgrave-placoand Thanet-place joining each other. As soon as the fire in the warehouse of Messrs. Watkinson had got hold of the premises the combustible articles there shot forth from the back a perfect shower of flames, which in a very few minutes ignited tho rear of the houses in Thanet and Palsgrave places. Up to this period no engine had arrived. There -were, however, two escapes belonging to the Royal Society, but fortunately their services were not required in saving life, as, owing to the early hour and the timely alars given, every person in the houses had an opportunity of getting out. When the engines arrived a copious supply of water was thrown on to the building. Mr. Scott, an officer of the brigade, at once forced open the door of Messrs. Watkinson, and, notwithstanding that the flames rushed out with fearful rapidity, be bravely held his ground until he had so far subdued the fire as to enable his men to carry a hose through the house and to play upon the back premises. This had the desired effect, and very soon the violence of the flames was in a great measure subdued; but, notwithstanding the most strenuous exertions of the firemen, the whole of Messrs. Watlinson's extensive warehouses were completely gutted, sod the shops of Messrs. Lane and Brown both severely atnaged at the back, and the others above-mentioned from T.aget to Palsgrave-place also more or less damaged by fire naf water.
- Thanet-placo the houses that have suffered most are NO.9, in the occupation of Mr. Wilkins-lodsing-house.
. .-Mr. Lufi, engraver and printer. Ns. 8.-Mr. Whitty, draughtsman.
No 10.-Mrs. Wright's lodging-house. The rear of these premies is entirely destroyed.
In hlsgrave-place the destruction was still greater. No. *.-Mr. Hiaughton (private). No. t-.Ur. Roscoe (chambers.)
No. 7.. Mr. Geoghegan (stationer). No. S.-Mr. LAne (private).
These ire all nearly gutted. We cannot help remark. ing that he firemen had a great difDiculty to contend with owi)g to the want of the co-operation of the rnetropolit.n police. Although the fire had been burning for oisvards of an hour, and engines had arrived from all pIats of London, there were only a few policemen p resent, sr,dthe ConseqUence was that therA was no force to keep the mel back, and they blocked up the whole of the roadt fromn tie spot where the fire was raging through Temple-bar ht Chancery-lane. The consequneuce was that no less than tiree engines were prevented getting near the fire. There w,re tee engines present.

CITY OF LONDON
The usual proclamation preliminary to an election Was made by the Sheriffs in the Gnildhall yesterday, and the nomination has been fixed for Friday next; the polling to take place on the following day. Mr. W. A, Rose having retired, in order to present himself to the electors of Newport, Lord J. Russell is now the only competitor to tho four candidates put forw ard by the Registration Association,viz., Baron Rothschild, Sir J. DTake, Mr. Crawford, and Mr. Currie. The aupporters of both parties have organized their coummittees and sub-committees, by whom the oity has been divided into districts for canvassing purposes. The canvass on behalf of Lord John was commenced as early as Thursday last, the very d ay on which the noble lord pre sented himself to the mleeting at the London Tavern; it has been actively prosecuted ever since, and the result so far is taken by his adherents as an earnest of certain success. The canvass for the other candidates was not opened till Saturday last, and it has proceeded hitherto very languidly, owing to the absence of al Conservative opposition. At the sa nie tinse, the friends of the four " Liberal and Commercial" candidates aver that Lord John is already far be hind, and confidently anticipate tbhat he will not only be rejected, but wi?l be left in a 'miserable minority." It is not felt to be necessary by either side to stimulate excitement by the holding of public meetings or the keeping up of an active fire of squibs or pasquinades. The only notice able attempt in the latter line is the issue (doubtless un authorized) of some wretched doggrel verses, in which vile puns are made upon the name of Mr. " Raikes" Currie, the bad taste of which those whose cause they are intended to serve would be the first to repudiate. Until the nomination the contest altogether promises to be a dull and spiritless affair.
WESTMINSTEj3.
A proclamation has been issued by Mr. Smedley, High-Bailiff of W1estminster, appointing the nonination for noon on Thursday next, at the usual place in Covent-garden-market. No signs of electioncering bhstle and excitemniut are visible within the precinct5 of this ancient city, which has been the scene of So many severe political struggles. Sir De Lacy Evans and Sir J. V. Shelley, the late members, are the only candidates who have issued addresses to the constituency, and there seems little prospect of any opposition being offered to the return of those gentlemen. Mr. Westerton, -whose name is well known in connexion with the recent proceedin,gs in the Ecclesiastical Court and before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council relative to the Puseyite practices at St. lPaul's Church, Knightsbridpe, and SIr. J. C. Wood, a brewer, of Victoria-street, Pimlico, have been mentioned as candidates, the former gentleman being recommended as in favour of " Parliamentary reform, a large extension of the suffrage, vote by ballot, disendowment of Maynooth, no church-rates, and no Tractarian encroachment," and the latter gentleman being described as a Liberal Conservative. No active measures appear, however, to have been taken by either of these gentlemen to bring their claims prominently under the notice of the electors. Mr. Westerton is ready to come forward, provided he is returned without expense to himself, and we believe his friends will determine this day (Tuesday) whether or not he shall take the field.
MARYLEBONE.
This borough is at present entirely 1ree from the excitement which pervades every other part of the metropolis. Sir B. Hall and Viscount Ebrington are the only candidates who have yet presented themselves to the electors, and there is every prospect tha * they wi be elected without opposition. 'The writ was m ot received by the returning officer until yesterday morning, so that the nomination cannot take place before Friday. Both candidates have issued addresses; Lord Ebringt( u's is dated Naples, where his Lordship is at present residing. He states that be expects to be able to resume his Parliamentary duties in about two months, and with regard to the Chinese q,nestion, liesays thathadhebeen present hesbould have given his su p port " to the Mlin,ister who, at a .ime of extreme difficulty, undertook the Government wv-en it was abandoned by others, and who has throughout his long political career upheld the honour and interests of the British empire,"
THE TOWER HAMLETS.
Mr. Child, the returning officer, proclaimed the writ this (3Monday) morning, and, by advertisement in T7ie T2imes, he has fixed the nomination for Friday, at noon. The late representatives, Sir W. Clay and Mr. Butler, solicit reelection. An address has appeared from a former opponent, Mr. Acton Ayrton, in which he declares he wiiU sustain the Government in carrying on the war with China with the utnmost vigour now that we have become involved in it, but excepts to diplomatic agents or naval commanders embroiling the country with foreign Powers without first referring to the deliberate judgment of the Govermnent at home.
' The groat services (he says) rendered by Lord Palcerston to the nation during the crisis et the Russian War place him in the highe3t rank Of public aen, entiue himn o every honour which he can receive, and deserve to be remsembered with gratitude by the country; but a people who deprived a Wellington of the chief office In hbe State when be interposed the weight of his great name to their political progreos could not be chargeablo witis ingratitude whenever they cease to sustain any binister who wil not regard their social affairs as of paramount importance,"
Reduction of the army and navy and "over-grown!' establishments-more frequent Parliaments-Administrative reform-extinction of small boroughs-voluntary principle in religion-local government in matters relating to health and property, and vote by baUot are some of the views advocated in the paragraphs of an unusually long address. Mr. Ayrton also teU his constituents:-
" For national education, I have matured aplan which, affording to it suDAcient imcpul e and support, wiu trench neither on the rights of fathers of faniliea nor the principles of Toluntary action. A couege In conne.'ion with the University of London ought to be establised in the centre of your borough, to open for your sons the highest degrees or learning at the lemt cost."
In public aftir I should act and vote with the Radical party, supporting that Government which mar entitle itaelfte the confidence of the country by the liberality of its measures and its eficient administration of publie banese"
A meeting is announced to take place on Tuesday evening, at the Beaumont Institution, when Mr. Ayrton will address the electors, He has determined not to canvass, and from the dull and languid appearance of the borough it may be inferred that no real contest is intended, and that the two gentlemen who represented the Tower Hamlets in the late Parliament will be re-elected without a poll
AxGLpsFYv BOROvnsS.-Lord George Paget has issued a farewell address on retiring from the representation of these boroughs. The Hon. W. 0. Stanley has publicly addressed the electors at Holyhead.
BOSTON.-On Saturday evening a crowded meeting of the supporters of Mr. Herbert Ingram was held at the London Tavern, Mr. Caister in the chair. Mr. Ingram addressed the meeting at some length, but declined to express any opinion one way or the other with regard to the qualifications of the various candidates for the second seat. He utterly repudiated the charge that he was in favour of taxation, though those who contended that there should be no taxation were, be thought, little better than knaves or fools. The only way to reduce taxes was by reducing expenditure, and for the representatives of the people to oeep carefully on the watch to check the rapidly increasing tendency to draw upon the Consolidated Fund for the support of objects which should never have been charged upon it. The County Police Bill he evidenced as a proof of this tendency. He denoed that he was a mere Palmerstonian, though he had considered it his duty to support him during the late crisis. He felt, assured, however, that the noble viscount would move with the progressive spirit of the age, and that the next Parliament would see many reat and important measures carried into effect. Mr. lugram was loudly cheered in conclusion, and there seems no doubt but that he will be placed at the head of the pol.
BitricnTON.-Mr. Rennedy, in order to avoid a division in the Liberal interest, has retired from the contest, and Mr. Coningbam has a good prospect of success.
CA1n1RIDGE (COUNTY) AND ISLI Or ELY.-A new candidate has conie forward to contest the repreEentation of this county in the person of Mr. H. J. Adesne, who, in his address to the electors, declares himself a general suDporter of the policy of Lord Palmerston's Government, but not willing to fetter himself by pledges. Although himself a soldier, he could not be a party to any policy which miight tend to embroil our relations with foreign States; and, a consistent member of the Church of England, he was an advocate of religious liberty. He was opposed to any scheme of education not founded upon the Bible, but could see no objeotion to a suppreesion of church-rates so long as an equitable adjustment was made for the permanent security of our sacred edifices. Any well conceived measure for a moderate extension of the franchise to the educated classes would receive his support.
CARCDIGANS1insz.-No opoosition is as yet threatened aganst the return of the Earf of Lisburne, but it is thought a Liberal would stand a fair chance. Captain Pryse's return for the boroughs is thought certain, aud he is extremely popular.
CxscNAsvonSBIRs BOROUGNS.-A new candidate has appealed to the electors, in opposition to Mr. Bulkeley Hiughes. Mr. J. G. J. Green, of Ashly-house, Carnarvon prof esses to eoter the lists on broad and Liberal principles and advocates the diminution of the national burdens.
DsNmIGIISNIRE BOROUGHS.-Mr. West, Who retires through Wl-heaith, declines to support Mr. Mainwaring. A
's p ted contest is anticipated bet ween Mr. Mainwaring and
r rIM6aurice, whose views are, it is said, diametrically opposed.
D1NBIGs (COU,N;TY).-Sir Watkin Wynn and Colonel Biddulph will, it is expected, be returned anopposed. The former has represented the county for 16 years.
DEBBY-.-3r Lawrence Heyworth, who voted against Goverument on the Chinese question, "aa finaUy decllned to contest the borough. 3r. Alderman Moms, who announced himself as a candidate in MIr. Ieywortl's place, has also retired from the contest. The candidates now in the field are Mr. Bus, the preiset member, Mr. W. 31. James, a Chancery barrister, and Mr. Beale, deputy chairman. of the Midland Railway. All thsee areliAberal in poliri Mr. Bass, who sopported Lord, Ilinerston, is considred safe in his seat.

JAmes iu the Temperance Hall, the -meeting being presided over by Mfr. Alderranu Pegg. The struggle between these two cand:dates is expected to be a severe one. The addlress of a
Conserri-tive candidate is expecte to be shortly issued.
DER:esYslimtE (SouTH).-There is every probability of a severe contest in this division of the county. The following
-Andlidates are in the field :-Mr. Colvile (a libera Conservative, the present member, M1r. Mundy, his colleague, Iraving retired), Lord Stanhope, son of the Earl of Chesterfield, and Mr. Clowes (Cnservative, and Mr. Evani; (Liberal). Each of the candidates has addressed. thre electors, and an active and organized canvass of this division of the county has been instituted. All four candidates join issue in deprecsting the motion which led to the present Parliament
being dissolved, and are against any innovation on the Sabbath. Upon Mr. Locke Ring's motion for the extension of the county franchise they go in pairs, Mr. Evans and Mr. Colvile beiing in favour of, and Mr. Clowes and Lord Stanhope antagonistic to the proposal.
DEvox (Nostra).-There is every probability of a very severe contest in this division of the county. The battle has already commnenced, and it is expected to resemble in intensity and vigour those hard-fought contests between Lord Ebrington, now Earl Fortescue, and Sir T. D. Acland
,which made this part of the c-ounty somewhat famous A0
years ago. There are two Conservatives in the field, Sir S. Northoote and the Hon. Mr. Trefusis, and a liberal in the
pesnof Mr. James Wentworth Bulier, of Downes. Mr. Trefuis is on The continent, -and has not yet made any dleclaration of hisiolitical principles; but being the brotheorof the -Hon.-MarkRolle, whio has extensiveproperty in NorthDevon, he is expected to bercarried Iwithout mnch difficulty. The fih:-hrfrbbtenir.XrhoenX.ulr The former is a follower of the Gladstone and the Peel. party, and being, as the bon. baronet expresse it, "a ureusber of thie broad church," he is not popular with a lar-ge numnber of the electors. Mr. Ilisler, on the other hand, is a stronag supporter of Lord Palmnerston, and being personally very muchl esteemed by a large number of electors, he stands a fair chance of election. Sir S. Northcote and M1r. Boller have addressed open air meetings at Barnstaple and Grea6t Torrington during the past week. As a& proof of the popularity of Mr. Buller, it imay be stated that several thousand pounds have already been subecribed by his frisilds and supporters in order that his election may be secured to him tree of expense.
D0RecnxSTlEs.-(By Electric Telegrapb.)-Mr. Jeremiah Pilcber arrived this daLy (Monday) at 1 o'clock, and immediately commenced his canvass, which appears to have been far more successful than be could have anticipated. He is
asupporter of Lord Palmerston.
DUDLEIY.-AIi Op'position candidate has at last been lound in the person of Mr. Henry Brinsley Sheridan, a barrister, and a grandson, it is said, of te celebrated dramais~it. He issiued an address to the electors yesterdlay, in which be states his opinion on the various questions of the day:-
" Income-tax.-I am a stanclt advoratefor Itrentirs and lImmediate abolition, Church-rates.-4 am in favour of their rereal ; but am willing to substitute, If practicable, somes equivalent that wil preserve cur magnificent national edifices trom decay, and at the seme time secure to our Protestant church the alliance and protection of the State. Francbiae.-I sin In favour of grradually and carefully exten& ing the francbise to meet the wanta arising from the advancement and progress of the age, and in fmitberance of this view am willing to place the county voter upon an equality witha the borugh voter by giving him a £10 qnalification. Army and Navy.-I am decidedly In favour of a thorough and searching reform in both these departments of the national service, and particularly of introducing, ass achief feature of smohreform, the practice of granting oommissons and giving p,omotlon to merit. Bhipping and Sound Dlues.-Sam determinedl to use every constitutional mueang to obtain the entire removal of theso obstructive Imposts, believing that no corporate funds oughkt in be increased by taxes th-,t amounmt to a restristlon on tiade, and which press with peculiar severity upon Induetry and manufacture. Extraparecbial Propeity.-AU property should and mnust be made to bear ita equal abase of locsal burdens. The WaLr with Chins.-I am n3ot in favour of delegating to individuals the power to declare war in the namne of Great 3ritain, or the sight to bomabard citiesi and to destroy life anidproperty. II deprecate sa,ll times the unniecesary shededing of human bloo, but. the Chinese war having now commnenced, and the intereata inTolved being so enormous, I am in favour of adopting every legitimaate means for bringing the conflict to an end, a jealous regard being had for the honour of English policy and the power of English maight. Education.-This I am desirous of extending to its utmost limits, totally Irrespectlve of sectiarladnim firmly belleving that to education we mnust look for the uliumate happiness and proaperity of tihe country. The Balot.-I am not disDosed to adopt the ballot, believing that the reasons at present urged in 6- voixt of secret voting will rapidly and altegether pass away with the growing intelligence and progress of the age. Preo trade hia my unquallified support.
Duinmi (SOUTH).-A mieeting was held on Filday at Darlingtoni for the purpose of fixing if posble upn the Liberal candidates for the division. M~ r.at. ePeapse, well k-nown in the district as one of the three missionaries of peace to the late Emperor Nicholas of Russia, was proposed as an opponent of Mr. Farrer, and a requisition inviting him to stand was placed on the table. It is believed that, unless the requisition is so numerously signed as to give strong anticipaLtions of succes, Mr. Pease will not enter upon the contest.
EsSEx (SouTrr).-Mr. Bramston and Sir W. B. Smita are to h oposed by Mr. R. B. Wingfield, of Orsett-hall, who hasisue the following address-
`I am a suppGrter of the great principles of civil and reUlgous liberty. I believe the utmost freedom of opinion la mest conducive to the welfare of the State. I ain Birmly attached to religion, and so to the Eetablished Chureh of this country, to which I belong. The maintenance of its churches musz be provided for; but the great and pawing disinclination to the present mnode of keeping the churches In repair by rates mzakes it imperative that acme alteration must take ulacos as to remove all disputes on the subject. I approve of the principles of freo trade. I am a sincee friend to thos who togpthsr with myself are Interestod in and laLbouir for the productions of the soil. I am an advocate for the greatest reduction that can be obtaine of ihe tax on malt, and, If possible. for Its entire extinction. I WMl5 sproet all efficient reforms In the law. Though I approve ef flueS taxa. tion I do not think the present Income-tax basd on Just principles ; I would therefore support all ameliorations In the mnode of exacting thO present income-tax, io that It should be aDporhaned In its weight to the extent of the interest In the income. I am in favour of the extension of the franchise, and think it due to the increasing, and useful lor increasing the, improvement of all. I would advocate all economy consistent with the interest of the countr7. In PArliament I would rupport the present Government5 and such men and such memmasursa to the host of my judgment woutld be moss conducive to the prosperity

FnnT (ourvy)-Aseereandshrp ontrtIs expeted
FLL'iTHMlE BO0ROUGHS.-Mr. R. P.'Warren ha again determined to go to the poll, in0 oposition to Sir Johmn Hanmner. Mr. Warren announces him Il as an independent Conservative, pledged to .support Conservative principles, I mt bound to no party.
G-AIMOEGANSHIKE.-An active canvass is being carried on by the two Liberal candidates, Mr. C. R. M. Talbot, and Mr. H. Hussey Vivian, late M.P. for Truro. These
entlemen have united their interests, and their success is seemed almost certain. The present Conservative memnber, Sir George Tyler, retires, and Mr. W. V. E. Vaughan has come forward on the Conservative side. He will not pledge himself to support Lord Palmerston, but he is snot an avowed opponent to the present Premier.
GLocESTERS.-Admiral Sir M. F. Berkeley, senior naval Lord of the Admniralty, anid Mr. W. P. Plrice, the Liberal candidates for this city, addressed a large body of the electors on Friday evening. Sir P, Carden, the Conservative candidate, was not present. Admiiral Berkeley, in the course of his speech, said he had many years since become a convert to the ballot, and he had felt his conviction growing stronger every year that there was no other protection for the honest voter. Mr. Price contended, that so far from the ballot being un-English, it was essentially an English institution. Mr. Bowly proposed, end Mrx. Jelinger Symons, Her Majtsty's Inspector of Schools, seconded a resolution commaendatory of the ballot, which was unanimously adopted.
GREESWICR.-The only candidates who are at present in the field are General Codrington and Mlr. Montague Chambers, Q.C., the late members, both of whom have issued addresses offering themselves for re-election. A placard has however appeared requesting the elcotors not to romise their votes, as a "1thoroughly Liberal" candidate will shortly solicit their suifrages. IYlesterday, Mr. IL Chambers was engaged in aLn active personal canvass of the electors of Greenwich, but as yet neither of the candidates has addressed any public meeting of the constituency. The nomination has been fixed for Friday, and will takce place upon hustings, which are to be erected in Church. street.

C. Jervoise in combination with the other, was agreed to. It is generall understood that Mr. Datton willbe withdrawn and Lordw.ni
Cholmondeley be re-elected, -with Sir J. C. Jorvoise as his colleague.
B.AvEUFoRSDwEsT.-A hot contest is anticipated. Two candidates have issued their addresses, Mr. JonHory Philippe and Mr. William Rees. Mr. Phillipps says:-
',I voted against ?r. Cobdlen's resolution because, althougk dopD0mng events which have occurred, anud mosft anxious for she rosters-
it remeed no evil, was only calculated to aggravate existingdiSiculties andimPeel lthe lives and popertyof our fdelow-couutryme.,-
Mr. Rees states that he is for safe and judicious r.forms, especially desirous to avoid the wasteful expenditurr ef the public money, and to reduce the enormous taxation of the country to its proper limits. He is a warm and strenuous supporter of the ballot, and avows his desire to correct every abuse connected with the churches of the lana.
Ips,woic (BolRouGHoI-The Mayor (Mr. - Clhristopherson) received the writ on Sunday eveningm& and'his worship has fixed 'the nomination to take place on Friday next, and the polling en the day following. TVhe Liberal candidates, Mr. HughkEdward Adair, and IIn. J,. C. Marsh. man, addressed a large body of the electo. at, ilie CornExchange on Saturday evening. The reception they met 'with was not flatterig, especially the ttr entleman

MOiTGGOxzF.RysE.-No opposition is expected against the return of Colonel Wynn. There is a rumour of a Liberal being brought forward to contest the sat with Mr. Pugh, the present member for the boroughs.
NXwcATLsR%TYoli.4az.-There had been various rumours of opposition to the sitting members durinz the week, but these assumed no tangible form til Saturday evening, when a crowded publig meeting was held in the Lecture-room to consider the present state of the representation, which was alleged by the oonveners of the meeting to be unsatisfactory. Both the late members were present, and addressed the meeting. In the course of their observations they took strong ground in favour of Lord Palmerston and his Chinese policy, at the same time guarding themselves against being supposed to be his slavish supporters, andinstaucingthe case of Mr. Locke King's motion, iU which they had voted against him. Mr. Headlam especially expressed himself unable to understand the grounlds upon which the representation was considered unsatisfactory, and both gentlemen claimed to reAt their position, not upen a section, but upon the whole Liberal party. MIr. Culley, a town-counciUor, introduced Mr. Carstairs, of London, who, he said, had made his fortune as a merchant, and was now a retired independent gentleman. Mr. Carstairs then addressed the meeting, and said that on being acquainted that a suitable representative was wanted for JTewcastle and solicited to come forward he at once compled, and was now in their hands ready to undertake the representation of the borough in the ensuing Parliament on Lie ral principles, which rather verged towards Radicalism. With respect to the,Chinese, he said he was well acquainted with their character, and denounced them as the greatest barbarians. He did not altogether blame Lord Palmerston for his Chinese policy; still he thought war should not be entered upon save in the last resort, The Rev. Mr. Rutherford followed with a motion declaratory of the opinion of the meeting, that Mr. Carstairs was a fit and proper
rsontorepresent the borough in Parliament. Sir John 5,fe anadermuan of the borough, opposed this and called upon th constituency to re-elect the latemembers. The notion was then put, and a very considerable majority appeared for Mr. Crstairs, hut still there rwas an important
dference of opinion.
PZSuIDOKE (BoRLouHs).-The present member, Sir John Owen, of Toynton.house, 1S the only candidate for the Pembroke Boroughs. In his xddress he promises a steady and uncompromising support to the present Liberal Government.
PZmy' A-,N FALMOUTH.-Two other candidates for the united borough have appeared in the ersonsof Mr. William Rashleigh, of Mena,llly, in Cornwal, and formerly a representative of the eastern division of the county, and a Mr. Thomas Bradshaw, who dates his address from Hampton-court. Mr. R;5ahleigh avows himself a Conservative, and Mr. Bradshaw, although he supp)orts tho Government on the Chinese question, is cautiously reserved on general politics. Both these gentlemen are late, and Mr. Bradshaw it is thought wiU not remain in the field. Another candidate, a Mr. West, a barrister, from the Reform Club, visited this borongh on Friday, but finding the ground fully occupied, both he and Mr. Bradshaw, after ad-
dressng the electors at the Guildhali, Falmouth, on that evening, retired. At the same meeting Mr. Baring and Mr. Gurney were heard in explanation of their political opinions, and resolutions were passed unanimously to support them at the ensuing elecIon. Mr. W. Rashleigh has not visited the borongh since his address and there now remain three candidates in the field-Mr. HowelU Gwyn on the Conservative, and Messrs. Baring and Gurney on the Liberal side. A second Conservative is talked of, but no name has been put forth as yet.
RIcEnoiND (Yo37KsHRI;).-Mr. Rich and Mr. Wyvill met their constituents of the borough of Richmnond on Friday night. Mr. Rich, after explaining the principles wbich had influenced him in his Parliamentary career, referred to his neutrality on the Chinese question. He thought that Sir John Bowring had not only exceded his instructi,ns, but had positively acted against them. He had withheld his vote because n injustice had been committed by our Plenipotentiary, but he did not vote against the Cabinet because that wrong was not of their doing. To no M1inister would he give a passive adhesion, although Lerd Palmerston would receive his general support. The hon. gentleman said he was favourable to an extension of the county franchise, and to the discontinuance of churchrates, but he was opposed to the ballot. Mr. Wyvill cordially approved the measures which Ministers had ta-en with regard to the Chinese question, his opinion being that Sir John Bowring had no other course open to him, and Lord Palmerston no alternative but to support our representative in China. He himself was in favour of an extension of the franchise, bht he would make it go hand-in-hand with the education of the people. To free trade he had always given his decided adhesion, and he was prepared to carry out the principles of free trade to their fullest extent. The meeting was adjourned vithout *any resolution having been agreed to.
SAIPoRD.-There are now two Liberals in the field-Sir ELkanah Armitage and Mr. William MIassey. Mr. Massey issued his address yesterday and was introduced on the Manchester Excbange in the afternoon, where he was wellreceived. In his address, he hopes that his being a member of the Government will not be considered a disqualification. His principles are Liberal and Protestant, he is in favour of education, the moet rigid economy in the public expenditure which is compatible with the maintenance of navaland military establishments sufficient for the vindication of the national honour and the Drotection of those vast commercial interests in which not only the prosperity but the very existence of this country are involved. He was to address the electors last night.
SUEryDs.-The nonmination is Axed forFriday, and the poll for Saturday. Mr. Roebuck's seat is on all hands admntted to be secure, but there will be a severe struggle for the second se t between Mr. Hadfield, the present member and Mr. Overend, Q.C., the Conservative-Palmertni
candidate. Up to Friday night the result of the canvass, as stated by Messrs. Roebuck and Hadfield's committee, was, Rcebuck, 2,457;]Hadfield, 2,049; Overend, 91L The returns of Mr. Overend's committee were, Overend, 2,200; Roebuck 1,800; Hadfield, 1,400. As there are not less than 6,800 voters the returns of both committees must as yet be imperfect. Yesterday a large meeting of non-electors was held in Paradise-square, but in consequence of the inclemency of the weather it was adjourmed to the TownbalL The greatest enthusiasm prevailed in favour of Messrs. Roibuck and Hadfield, and the following resolutions were carried:- I
1. That in the opinion of this meeting we can onl *maintain and mecure the progress of our politcal, social and comnmercid institutons bythemaintenanceotathoroughlylhberalGovernment 2. Thatwe. the non-electors of Sbeffleld, have to express our oonfidence in Messs Roebuck and Haddeld, and earnestly recommend them to the support of the clectors at the comDing election. 3. That we, the non-electors of Shefreld, Pledge oursives to smite with the difrent district commaltteei and mue eTery effort to secure the return of Roebuck and Hadfeld."
SHoREHsAit.-Mr. H. W. Pemberton, a Liberal has come forward in opposition to Sir C. Burrell and Lord A. Lennox. His chances are considered but small, as the Duke of Richmond has great influence in the neighbourhood.
SomRzssT (WEsT.)-At a public meeting of the freeholders of the western division of the county, held at the Assembly Rooms, Taunton, on Saturday afternoon, it was resolved,-
*- That the Conservatire interest of the country at large wiu be best promoted In the e,resent emegency by resiting au adisturbacce of the representation of this division of the county, and the meeting pledges Itself to resist any sueh disturbance."
Mr. Sanford declines to come forward except theexpensesof a contest are guaranteed. A public meeting of the friends of
1fr. Sanford, who had been named as likely to contest this division, was held at Wellington on Thursday afternoon, when it was decided that that gentleman should not be brought forward. On Friday afternoon a large and influential meeting of magistrates and county gentlemen belong-^ ing to this division was held at Pattlson's, CastleHo7tel.
Taunton, Sir Alexander Acland HIood, in the chair, when it was unanimously resolved,-
That the Conservatiye interest3 of the country at large wiu be beet promoted in the present emergency by resisting any disturbance oftbe representation of this divtison of the county; and this meeting pledges ta, e to resist any such disturbance."
Mfr. Gore Langton, in his address, seeking re-election, says:-
"I have given, and shaUlcontinue to give, the prelent Govnment my support, whenever their measures have a conservative tendency. I know of no organied combination of partis to defeat Uord Palmerston's Government, and I cannot regret the vote that I gavo on tho Cbinese question. as Ihave yet to learn that the governor, of our coleisas are at liberty to plunge the nation into the horrors and expenses. o: war, without first having obained the sanctioa of Parliament."
SouTnwAnX.-Down to the present time the only candidates who have made their appearance in the field aro Mr. J. Locke, the City Pleader, and the two late members-- Mr. Pellatt, who has represented the borough since l8o,5 and Sir C. Napier,vwho was returned in November, 18D5, upanthe lamented death of Sir W. Molesworth. All the candidates lay claim to the eharacter of "advanced Liberals ' but, while MIr. Locke and Sir C. Napier express their unhesitating approval of Lord Palmerston's foreign holicys. Mr. Pellatt voted against that aoble Lord en the Cfhnese debate. In expiation of this vote, which has no doubt prejudiced him in the eyes of some of his former supporters, he deelares that it was given " conscientiously, not factiously :" and he adds that he is a "firm, consistent, yet in dependent' supporter of Lord Pasmerston's Gov.smmnent. Comparatively asieshli-g, little excitement prevailn in ths
oorough, and, although meetings are nighdy held by the different candidates, there is an utter absence of those exciting plkacrds and personal animosities wphioh, are not
unfrqiently the adjunets of a contested election. In addi: tion to. the meeting of Mr. Locke's friends, which will be found reported in another column meetings.were alo. held last nigbt by MlY. Pellattat the lhristehrob. Schoolroom, Marlborongh-street (Dr. J. Taylor in the ciair), a" by Sir C. Napier at St. George's Hall, St. George's.ro&4 at each of which numerous bodies of electors assambled, and reeo. lutions were passed in favour of the respective eaEidates. It is stated that Napier and Pellatt hsce coaleed. The nomination is appointed to take place on 8aturday next, and the -poling on Monday,
STo3-rroe-Tp.N-Tbe late monmbers,3es.s Ricardo Iand Gower, arrived on Thursday evelinziiiiheborough, and on Saturday evening attend 'ate ToWUhall, Longto, to adi:ess the electors. The Chie&Bailif was in the chair. The Hon. P. L. Gower, in addre &ing the Meeting, pessed in review the principal measures -iebich hl come before the House of Commons during the, }st five years, and remarked that it would be found that h%had uniformly voted with the friends of civil and religiora liberty. He was prenared to support the Adminiistrati,.M of Lorepalmeraton if the noble lord showed as mi.ch eubergy in promoting measures of reform as he did in, kjniging the war to a successfol terminat'on, Mr, Iticardo's speech consisted chiefly in a defence of the ihree votes he gave a t the Governmra nt-namely, theb one on the Turkish Lgoan, on the budget, 'and on the Chliese question. A vote of confidenes
was P'.sed in the twro hen. gentlemen. Many of Mr.

SUNDNRLAIM.-Tho ultra-Liberal party seem deternined to spare no effort to urnseat Mr. Fenwick, in order that their candidate, Mr. Walters, may be returned.
TAu:N To.-There is little doubt of the return of 3r. Labouchere, and of Mr. A.. Mills, the Conservative candidate, who wiU give the present Government an independent support. Mr. Campbell's canvass, it in thought, will not en.bolden him to go to the hustings.
TzwlxsDum-.-The four candidates have pledged themselves to W) to the polL 3 r. Hrumphrey Brown avows himself a almerstonian; Mir. MSartin is a Wbhi of the old school; Mr. Lygon, Conservative, says he advocates reirenchment and economy, reform, the Maynooth Rrant, and opening the Musenm, &c, on Sundays. Mr. E. W. Cox, Conservative, would reverse the decision of the House of Commons on tho ChiBese question; ho would not give his faith implicitly to any winister, but would try all Governments by their acts- he would support measures framed to promote thle sociai, moral, and religious welfare of the community, re'duetion by means of a wise economy, the spread of education based upon religion, and also safe and progressivq reform. Mrr. Lygon is understood to he quite safe. The contest will be between MAr. Mtartin and Mr. Cox;i it will be determined by the second votes of the Conservatives.
WAKEYIELD.-Since the retirement of Mfr. Leatham onO or two gentlemen have been named-Sir J. Ramsden, Mr. J. Shaw, of Stanley-ball, and the younger brother of Mr. W. B. Beaumont, of Bretton-hall-as likely to come forward on the Liberal interest; but they have each declined to contest the borough. It has also been stated that a deputation of Liberal gentlemen had gone to Manchester to endeavour to get a candidate in that town- but yesterday it was definitely understood that no canidiate would at present bo brought forward in the Liberal interest. Mr. Charleswrorth, Conservative, will, therefore, be returned unopposed.
WALLUGFORDc.-Xr R. Malins, QC., has met with two rivals in the persons of Mr. James Morrell, of Oxford, and Captain Sartoris, of the 7th HUESarS Both the new candi-
ates vowv them3elves supporters of Lord Palmerston's Government. In consequence of a sovere aoeident received while hunting, it is not probable that Mr. Morrell wi persevere in hiS pretensions, aed the contest wiU be between Mr. Mains and Captain Sartoris, who has the support of the late member, Ir. Blackatene.
W.siRwrcL-Sir C. Douglas has retired, and there is at resent no probability of any opposition to the election of
r. Greaves and Mr. Ripston.
WOLVHRHAmPTO'f.-The most influential and numerous meeting that has, perhaps, been ever held in Wolverhampton, took place there last night to recoive the sitting members, Messrs. Villiers and Thornely. After addresses from each of these gentlemen, during which the name of Lord Palmerston was received with marked approbation, it was umaniously resolved,
"Thst t'b meeting, having heard the atatements of princ'ple from the Rlebt Hon. C. P. rilleis and Mv. Tbomas Thomely, is of opinon thst they deserve the continued confidenoe of the borough of Wolrerhamp%on. and that ve hereby pledge ourelres to we their triumphant retbm"
YoRI;sn}RE (NonRT Rmrn;G).-The Hon. 0. Duncombe addressed the electors of the North Riding at Leyburn on Friday. He defended his vote on the Chineae question and denied the fact of any coalition having been effcted to overturn the Pnameriton Cabinet, to rhich he acnmowledged the country to be deeply indebted The contes t promises to be a very severe one,
SCOTLIiD.
Dumfriesmhsw-On bthe afternoon of Friday tmeb30th inst. hr James Hannay, of London, addregned the electors of Dumfries The place of meeting was the theatre, and on a
erv bief notio s iwascompletely filled. He exprfessd regret that his native town of Dumfries, whiah was known before Liverpool or Manchester Logred on the maps, had not been represented at all in the late divion in Parliament. If ts sort of thing were tob be permi by constituencies there ould be no need of the franchise at all, sand inumtfries might as well boa little towgn in Timbuctooh lr HanDay then disclaimed the allegntions that he was a fol lower of fr. Disraella or a Tory of the old school eis name had been associated wit theat of Lord Shtnley, but though an admirer of that young nobleman he was not his phbotet H d nor was Lord Stnley hi patron He professed his readiness to support those measures of a sanitary and social eharacter wohich Lord Stanley, much to his honour, promoted; hut ho wlould not oppOse any such measures if brought forwvard by Lordt Palmerstom. He then condemned the recent procaedings in China, stat
ing that though the Chinese might have erred in some respects, they ought to have been treated wiith some degree of forbearance, and if chastised at all, chastised as one would children, instead of bringing the tremendous artillery of Bnrtain to bombard their towns and decimate the inhabitants. He did not attach any value to the proposals for exctending the suffrage as a means of elevating the people, and considered that would best he
accomplishe by spiritual-not mechanical means. There ia some probability of a third candidate starting for tbe Dlinfries burghs. A certain section of th eonstituency dislihing Mr. Eart, and not deeming Mr. Hannay quite to their taste, are turning their eyes towards Mr. James Caird, of Baldoon, the well-knowrn asncculturist. A requisition t
him was set agoing in Dumfines on Fiday, uad, if respectably signed was to bo presentedtolum as soon thereafter as possitle. b r. Ewart as bsy onThursay, Fiday, and

Some discussion took place in reference to
the corruption which prevailed among a small, section of the consituency, and a general desire was expressed that bribory shouf d be completely extinguished in the borogh. Several of the electors having this objeot in view> as well as the presorvation of peace and order tharoughoub
the countg, were favourable to the proposition and for Captain Ponsonhy's retulrn; while, on the other hand, a portiondof the electors strongly objected to anything in the form of a compromise, nd expressed their belielf that iE Mr. Alexander (in whom they plked unlimited confidence) came forvard, he would be returned by the incorruptble section of th e conshttuency. or Alex nder addressed the meeting amid much applauye, and concluded by stating th

Francis Sha d) immediately made the usual proclamation, announcing that the nominaton will take place orn Friday, and the electiononSaturday. The Toies are isu great exultation, believing that Saturdy, being the Jewis. Sabbath, wIl prevent electors of that persuasioa from recording their votes. It will not, however, make anv difference in that respet, it being the intention of the aaority to "plump" for Mr. Ewart, the Liberal candidate. It ?* contrary to the Jewish faith to take an oath on their Sabbath, and the Conservatives, it is said, are determined t-o resort to the disreputable expedient of taking advantage oF tkat fact in order that the 300 or 400 Jewish electors ma
ho virtually disqualified. A meeting of the principal Jewe resident in Liverpool was to be held last night, for the pur pose of deciding wshxt steps shalll be taken in the event of such a contingency.

Election Law.*
ZLECTIO2>t LA W.*
Mr. Wngrove Cooke, of the English bar, has in the nick of time put forth a well-digested Manual of Election Lar. At the corner of every street we hear the same questions now asked. "How many days?" " What is a man safe in doing r' "How can we take advantage of the notorious bribery now going on in Rottenborough r' " By what means are we to work the machinery of the Corrupt Practices Act ?" Every one is at sea. There is no time to collate the half-a-dozen different Acts of Parliament that bring conflicting provisions to bear upon almost every point of practice. When all England is to be polled in a fortnight bulky volumes, with indifferent indices, perplex without informing. If we would know at what time a county election may be commenced, we have to hunt for a atatute passed in the reign of Henry VI. i if we desire to learn the grounds of the popular beief that there must be 40 days between the proclamation and the return, we must collate Acts of William III. with the Scottish Union Act and with the Statute of 15th and 16th Victoria, which has altered the practice and reduced the number of days to 35. It is not creditable to our law reformers and our statute law commissions that this jumble of contradictory enactments should remain unconsolidated. However, here we have them reduced to order in 120 pages, and made so accessible by an index that a canvasser or an agent is without excuse if he commit his principal to the terrible consequences of bribery, treating, or undue influence. The author, however would have more wisely confined himself to what he rightly calls his " office of humble utility." When he "1 hopes that his book may be read when the excitement of the present contest has passed away, for the purpose of noting in what points our present futile laws against corruption fail," he goes beyond his province as a working lawyer, and deals with mattera upon which people who have bought his book have not sought his advice.
We extract a small bit of information, which which may be found valuable during the:next few days:-
II There is one duty, however, which is of extremo inportanCe. It it should come to the knowledge of the agent thAt the opposiDng candidate has, either by himself or his agent, been guilty of bribery, treitifig, or undue Influence, Or thae is, for any re;aon, disqualified from being elected, he should take immediate means to make this fact public should give notice to every voter coming to the poll that his vote will be thrown away if he rote for the disqualified candidate and should take vote of all those voters who vote for hgm after snch notice.
" On the other hand, great care is required not to act on false information; for if such notice shonld be given and it should be proved that it inflenced ans electors, and if the agent's principal should obtain a majority, he would, in all probability, be unseated if he failed tO prove the facts stated in his notice.
" The advantage of gIving notice is, that the unsuccessful candidate at the poll thereby gains the seat, instead of merely voiding the election.!
The book also contains some plain practical instructions as to framing a petition, and carries the history of the contest up to that ultimate stage when, the bribery having been proved and a eommission having sat, a Disfranchisement Act iputs the guilty borough to death and buries it by the side of Sudbury and St. Alban's.

Pollock's Practice Of The County Courts.*
POLLOOKCS PBACTECE 0F THE COUNTY
OOURTS.*
It is curious to observe the growth of the County Court system, and the hold which, as an institution, it is gaining upon the country. Since the establishment of these Courts in 1847 the Legislature has from yeazr to year added to their practical utility: first, by increasing their jurisdiction to the recovery of sums above 201.; next, by extending to them the jurisdiction of Insolvency; and, further by referring to them the summary jurisdiction under no less than 41 Acts of Parliament. But an idea of their popular activity may best be conveyed by the number of their chief officers and the extent of their operations.
There are 60 Judges, nearly 600 Courts, and 23 Treasurers, in England and Wales. About 15,000,0001. sterling have been sued for since their establishment in 1847, and no less than 7,500,0001. have been paid to the officers of the Courts, the whole of whioh has been checked and audited by the Treasurers, while In no Court have the suitors sustained the slightest loss, which circumstance may be attributed to the audit of the Treasurers, as It is notorious that, under the old Courts of Request, which were with few exceptions without the supervision of Treasurers, very serious defalcations continually occurred.
So large an activity, with so few abatements to the convenience of the County Court system, is without a paralel in any institution of modern creation or development, and it is not without reason, public as wel as professional, that we continuaUly require new mrauals to explain its operations.
The volume which at present comes under our notice is already so well known and esteemed that it reached a second edition in October, 1853, but this, which is a third edition of the same basis, has been in a great measure written anew, while its subject-matter has been generaly re-arranged. This reconstruction of the work was rendered necessary partly by the decisions of the superior Courts in the interim; partly because, since the second edition was published, material additions have been made to the jurisdiction of these Courts by the County Court Amendment Act of last session, the Friendly Societies Act of 1855, and by the order of Her Majesty in Council, extending to these Courts the provisions of the Summary Procedure on Bills of Exchange Act, 1855. By the Friendly Societies Act it is provided that, where the rules of a society have directed disDutes to be referred to justices, they are to be aecided by the County Court; alro that the Cotuty Courts shall entertain applications for the removal of trustees of such societies, or for any relief, order, or direction, or to enforce the decision of any arbitrator, or to determine disputes if no arbitrator has been appointed, &c. And the Court may give the same relief to the Coart of Chancery. It has also power to make orders on behalf of members who may be dissatisfied with the provision made for them on the dissolution of a friendly society. By the order in Council above mentioned of the 30th of January, 1856, the provisions of theSunimaryProcedure on BiUs of Exchange Act, 1855, were extended to the County Courts in actions where the claim does not exceed 501. The County Courts Amendment Act of last session, the 19th and 20th of Victoria, chap. 108, containing 86 clauses, and affecting a variety of subjects, has also necessitated such changes in the present treatise that it is substantiaUy a new proof of the care and industry of the authors.
The book has been conveniently divided into two parts, the first containing the jurisdiction of the Courts in all matters except those which relate to the Insolvent and Protection Statutes, which have been treated of exclusively in the second part. Where it is probable that the jurisdiction given tothe Courts will be but rarely resorted to, as in the cases of the Customs' Act, 1853; the Succession Duty Act, 1853; the Merchant Shipping Act 1854. the Metropolitan Building Act, 1855; the Nuisauces Removal Act, 1855; and the Joint-Stock Companies' Act, 1856; these subjects have been Judiciously noticed in the Introduction only. Thus the body of the work is kept clear for the more general jurisdiction of the Courts, and the arrangemnent of their various operations is thereby simplified. We should remark the addition of marginal references to the rules and forms, and to the sections of the Acts in the Appendices, which have been frequently left to edit themselves; and we especially commend the tabular arrangement of the Index, which shows at a glance the sections of the Acts and rules bearing upon each subject, and which, as far as we could test it perfunctorily, appears to be sufficient.

Chinese Emigration.
CHINESE BMIGRATION..
TO THE EDITOR OF TEi TIMES.
Sir,-The letter from Mr. Thomas H. Gladstone which you published yesterday deserves the serious attention of Her MAjesty's Government, for the horrible description he therein gives of Chinese emigration to Cuba, and its consequences, is truly disgraceful to this country. British ships have until last year been engaged in transporting crowds of Chinese, without any regulation as to number, or space, or provisions, for the voyage from China to Havannah. And, though they are now subject to some control in these respects under the Act 18th and 19th of Victorla, cap. 104, it is obvious that Chinese coolies when landed in Cuba, as apprentice-labourers, have no chance of being treated as freemen. The only regulation that can prove effectual for their protection is one which ought to be applied to al emigration-that no British ship shaU be permitted to convey emigrants to any country in which slavery exists All engagements for service to be performed in countries where slavery previl3 will degenerate into bondage, as has been well exemplified by Mfr. Gladstone from what he saw during his sojourn In Cuba.
As Chinese have also been conveyed to the British West Indies, Mr. Gladstone naturally invites inquiry respecting the manner in which they have been introduced, and the condition in which they re found in our own colonies; and, considering that the only effectual means of suppressing slavery is to render free labour practically cheaper within the tropics, as it is in Europe, I hope you will allow me to explain whathas been done to make the experiment of transferring free labourers from China to these fertile possesions.
In the year 1851 the colonies of Guiana and Trinidad united to send an intelligent agent, under the sanction of the Home Government, to China, for the purpose of ascertaining whether suitable labourers could be induced to emigrate to these colonies, and what armngements would be necessary to conduct the emigration in a satisfactory manner. The agent employed, having been appointed by the Secretary of State, corresponded with the Emigration Commissioners, and a few extracts from their annual reports will show that the utmost care was taken to avoid mismanagement and to prevent abuse.
" In all parts of China visited br MIr. White, the joint agent of British Guiana and Trnidad, the country is peopled to excess, and there is a consequent struggle for the mere necessaries of life." . . "Those Chinese with whom Mr. Wbite communicated expressed no disinclination to emigrate, and asked no questions, except as to the rate of wrages and the cost of living; they insistedi, however, on an advrance of money at starting, principally for the eurpose of leaving it with their aged relatihes, and stipulated for the powrer of malditg further remittances. In no ease did they appear to contemplate receiving return passages to their
"We stated in our last report that Vreliminary steps had been taken for setting on foot an emigration irom China. Considerable delay occurred, arlsin, in the first instance, from the non-arrival in England of Mr. White, whose advice and services the West India Committee were justly anxious to secure before plunging into a new and delicate undertaking.
" The whole number of Chinese hitherto introduced into the British West Indies is as followsa:-British Guiana, 647; Trinidad, 988S; Jamaica, 472, 205 of which number came from Panatma."
Contrary to 3Mr. Gladstone's impression, it wllM be seen that the number of Chines is inconsiderable. They have generally proved excellent labourers, and there is a great desire to continue the immigration; but there is even a stronger desire to commence the colonization of Chinese by bringing fa-milies, or at least young married couples. It is, indeed, alleged that the emigration of females is contrary to the lex sc-ipta of China. The same observation may be made in regard to the emigration of males, though thousands embark openly at all the principal ports throughout the year. Those who have promoted emigration fromChina have preferred adult males because their purpose has been to obtain effective Labourers. This is doubtless, also, the most urgent motive with our own Planters, but their interests would lead them further to connect this object, even at some present expense, with the important benefit which would arise from the permanent settlement of an industrious and increasing population on their plantations. The British West India proprietors are, in fact, the only parties who appear to be willng to encourage the emigration of Chinese women as well as men. It has, however, been always difiicult in the first period of Any emigration to induce females to remove. And there is even now a great disparity of the sexes in our golden Australian colonies. In the emigration from Calcutta to the British West Indies the proportion of females has been annually increasing; and, as having some bearing on the Chinese question, I mnay here give the particulars of the emigration from that porti to British Guiana during the last; fewr months:-
Males. Femaes. Children. Infant. Weledl .... .. 254 .. 84 24 .. So 33cuphalux ..S U5 .. 84 . 29 .. 15 SirR Sepolng in.. I S7 59 . 26 9 RnOMAn perre.. 207 . 68 26 1I
Total .. 910 2! 105 -56
Thse figures indicate a nearer approach to colonization than any previous experience.
From China emigration to our colonies muast be conducted under the Passenere' Act, 18-19 Victoria, cap. 104. When the emigrants arrive in the West Indies they are, of course, under the guardianship of the Governors appointed by the Crown, and are in the full enjoyment of all the privileges of British free labourere, presenting a perfect contrast to the miserable fate of their countrymen who are carried to Cuba,

(EXTRACT OF A LET'XR FROM WILLIAM BAy, DATED
HONGKONG, DxCSmBm 31, 1856.)
I think I wrote you that I was in the bark Courser. I joined her at Bombay in November, 1855. Icamo out here, trading from one port to another. Ileft herlastAugest,and tookcommandof a lorchainthecoastingtrade. Ileft here on the 10th of September for Chinchew, with a valuable cargo, but when within 20 miles of that port was boarded, and after a severe struggle was taken by Chinese pirates, .my mate and several of the crew were kiled, I received a shot through the leg, a severe cut on the head, and three other wounds, and was made prisoner. The vessel was taken, plundered, and ultimately burnt what became of the remainder of the crew I never learnt. I was carried some distance into the interlor and treated brutaly. I shudder now to think of it. Sick, lame, and weary, I was goaded almoet to madness; my wounds undressed, and suffered to remain so; no one to assist me. I dared not complain. What little the barbarians gave me to eat was thrown at me. At one time I gave all up for lost. Why they suffered me to live so lonI I cannot say ; but it wil take too long to tell all the horrid tale suffice it to say, after being a prisoner among them nine long dreary weeks, suffering and enduring all that man could suffer, I at last made my escape to the coast, and after five days spent in toil, pain, and starvation was picked up by a veme bound here, where I arrived on the 7th of this month in a state 'which may well be conceived; all that I had in the world was an old shirt, pants, and hat. I apphed to the authorities here and stated the case, when a man-of-war steamer was despatched up the coast, but has since returned with no tidings, the pirates leaving no vestige whe.eby they might be traced. I wan immediately sent to hospital, where I have been ever since- my leg has been most trouble. At one time it was thought it would have to be taken off, but It is now nearly well. I can just manage to put my foot to the ground. I hope soon to be able to go to sea again, and commence the world anew."
SMUGGLING IN CHINA.-Some correspondence re-
SHUGGIaNG IN CHWA.-,Some correspondence relative to consular interfernce for the revetijon of smug. gling in China was prEsented to the late Parliament a few days before its dissolution. viscount Pal. merston, then Foreign Secretary of State, wrote to Sir G. Bonham in May, 1851, respecting the expediency of devis. ing effectual means for stopping the system of smuggling prevailing in China, and especially at Shanghai. The smug. gling appears attzibutable to the remissness and corruption of the Chinese Authorities, and on the twofold ground of a certain clause in the treaty of Hoo-mrnchae, and of tho emission of the China Government itself to act upto the manifest intention of the existing treaties. Lord Palmerston determined to withhold for the future al interference on the part of the British consular authoritie6 for the protection of the Chinese revenue. The Government of ler Majesty came to this decision with reluctance, but, as the Chinese authorities would not do their duty in preventing dishonest traders from defrauding the Emperor of his just dues, the British Government could no longer order Her Majestys consuls to do that for the Emperor which his own servants did not deem it necessary to do.

Sir JOHN PATTESO.N, and Sir JoMN DODSONlI
Sir JOEN PA-rSso0y delivered the judgment of their Lordsahips in this case, which was argued during the recent sittings. The first question in this case relates, he sald, to the national character of the claimant, 3Er. Sorensen, jan It was strongly contended on the part of the captors that he could not be properly considered to be a Dane. The circam. sances under which he took a counting-house at Altona, with a lodging at Hamburg, are undoubtedly peculiar; and the precise time when he went thither and, of consequence, the exact length of time that he had continued thera when the war between this country and Russia broke out are not fully ascertained. Their Lordships, however, looking at the general law on this subject, and particularly adverting to the Ca3S of the " Conferensrath" (6 Rob., 362), entirely agreed with the learned judge of the Admiralty, that Mr. Sorensen, jun., has succeeded in etablishinu his claim to a Danish national character. The next and importnt question is whether Mr. Sorensen. jon., was the owner, and sole owner, of the ship Axiel at the time of the capture. Now, this questionturnsupontwopoints:-First was -there a real bond d sale absolutely to Mr. Sorenseri; jun., of the Ariel without collusion or fraud ? Secondly, did any interest in the ship remain in the seller at the time of the capture ? The ship Axiel is one of the several vessels alleged to belong to the claimant which were seized in British ports some time after the breaking out of the war, the And being seized at Belfaston herreturnfrom America with a cargo on the 2d of December, 15 This case is dis. tinguishable from the others, As to which there is not any appeal at present before their Lordshipa, but which have been so alluded to in the argument that it is impossible wholly to exclude the mention of them. The distinction between them is in regard to the preoise terms of the origin sale to Mr. Sorensen, jun., and is such that their Lordahips might perhaps determine this case on that distintion, without coming to any positive decision as to the general question which applies to them alL Bat, npon consderation, their Lordships have thought It right to state their opinion npon that general question. The faets appear to be that the Ariel was a Russian ship, nd before the breaking out of the war belonged to a Russian subject, Mr. Eckhoff, as administrator of Mr. Hagedorn, who had been for some time consul for tP;a Netherlands at Libau, and also a merchant and shipown - 2 there and died in April, 1853. Some stress was aid on this i the argument, it being contended that Mir. Eckhoff was bound to sell the Ariel for the benefit of the estate of Mr. Hagedorn, who was not a native of Russia, but had only a mereantile domicile in Russia during his life and residence there, and, having died before any contemplation of war, never vas or could be, by any possible construction, an enemy of this country, nor conld his property, after his death, be considered as Russian property. The doctrine of utik tempsi for a foreigner residing in a country, between which country and nother A war breaks out, to remove him and his property from that country to his own, was supposed to apply. Bat that doctrine applies only to cases where there is a bon4d jde intention to remove. There is no evidence whatever of any intention on the part of MIr. Eckhoff, the administrator, to remove Mr. Hagedorn's property to the Netherlands, and the doctrine of utile tempn appears to be wholly inapplicable. The most that can be made of the representative charneter of Mr. Eckhoff is to place him in the same position as Mr. Hagedorn himself would have been had he been still alire. Now, Mr. Hagedorn had unquestonably a mercantile domicile at ibau, in Russia, and had he been hving, and become the sel]er of the Ariel, instead of Mr. Eckhoff, he and his ship must according to all authorities have been considered Russian. Another of the ships seized,-namely, the John, belonged to another Russian subject, Mr. Gamper; and another, the Industrie, to a Mr. Rode; and the rest of the ships belonged to Mr. Sorensen, sen. (the father of the climant), who had for manv years been the Danish consul at Lihau, and was also a merchant and shipowner there, and therefore clearlyaRussiansubhect, sofarasrehtesatotheseships. The RussianAmbassadorleftEnglandonthe8thofFebraarl85L Atthattime the claimant was carryingon, andhadfor about two years carried on, the business of an agent in England. On the 22d of February, 1854, he was summoned to Hamburg by his father by a telegraphic message. They met at Hamburg, and it was then arranged that the claimant should leave England and establish himself at Altona and become a Danish subject, with a view to purchase his father's ships, and some others, and trade with them on his own account. He had not suflicientmeans of his own to Pay for such ships, but he was told that the speculation would probably be very advantageous, even to the extent of 100 per cent., and arrangements were made between him and his father to enable him to carry it out, and he accordingly returned to England and disposed of his concerns there and came to Altona to become a Danish subject. He purchased his father's vessels, and also the John, and the Industrie, and the Ariel (the ship in question). The Arie was sold to him by his father under a power of attorney given by Mr. Eckhoff to the father for that purpose, he (Mr. Eckhoff) being personally unacquainted
wit the claimant, on tho 6th of Mlarc, 18 . The British declaration of war issued on the 29thof March. These dates seem of themselves to show that the sale was made in contemplation of war, and imminente bello in a popular sense; but the evidence In the case goes further, and shows conclusively that the Russan 'suowners at Libau, feeling that war was at hand, and that they could not employ their ships under the Russian flag, determined, on consultation, to sell their vessels, even at coniderably reduced prices, to neutrals rather than keep them unenmployed in Russian ports. It is argued that war cannot bo sai to be imminent unless there bo au embargo, or some similar act of the country about to be belligerent, and cases are cited in which such circumstances bave occurred ; but none of those cases go the length of laying down any positive role as to the necessity of such circumstances. Their Lordships are of opinion that there is abundant proof that the sale was made imminate belo, and in contemplation of it. Still, if the rale was absolute and bond Wde there is no rule of international law, as laid down by the courts of this country, which makes it illegal. Such a bond fide sale made even fla-rante belo would be legal, much more immiaente beUo. The ship Axiel was In port at the time of the sale, therefore the cases as to the illegality of Wlesin tranritu do not apply. Was, then, the sale of this ship absolute and bo! . eI
Assredly the time of the sale, the circumstance of the. claimant making himself a nentral for the express purpose of buying this and the other ships, and his inablity to pay the whole price, all tend to throw suspicion upon the sale, and to malke it incumbent on the Court to look closely Into the history of the tra-nsaction, it being obviously the intention of all parties to place the ship, by such We, out of the reaeh of eapture by th belligerent If thes had, bou facts leading to a well.fornded conclusion that a secret understanding existed betwveen the seller and the claimant that the ship should be restored to the seUer in the event of no war breakig out, or in the event of a speedy peace, or that the ship should be employed by the claimant under the direction and for the benefit of the seller, the Court would bo bound to hold the sale to be collusive and void, and to condema the ship as Russian property. But no sach facts are even surmised in this case. It appears by theevidence of Mr. Eckhoff himself (appendix, p. 31) that Mr. Sorensen, the father, informed him that he should advise his son to purchase the Aniel if Mir. Eckhoffdid not require all the purchase-money at the time of the sale and transfer, inasmuch as his son would not have sufficient money to pay for all the vessels he intended offering him for sale, and that he therefore intended to sell his sbips to his son, to aCCOta portioix of the purchase-money at the te of sale, and to allow his son to pay him the remainder of the purchasemoney out of the earnings of the vesses. Mr. Eckhoff goes on to say that, by reason of what Mr. Sorensen, the father, bad so communicated to him, he agreed to ell the Ariel to the claimant under the folowing stipulation or conditionnamely, that the anount of the purchase-rnoney should be 10,000 silver roubles; that 3,333 silver roubles and 33 copecks, or say one-third of the purchase-money, should be paid in cash at the time of effecting the sale and transfer of the Ariel; that a similar sum or instalment of one .hird of the purchase-money should be paid in six months after the sale aud transfer, and the remaining one-third in nine months. He adds that had it not been for the very high character and well-known honour and integrity of Mr. Sorensen, the father, he would not have agreed to sell the AnIel to the son, except for ready cash, inasmuch asho was then and sti was personally unknown to the son. It is argued that Mr. Eckoff does not in terms deny that he agreed to be paid the zemaining two-thirds of the purchasemone out o the earnings of the Axiel, and therefore it must o inferred that he did so agree, and accepted the same terms as the father did on the sale of his vessels Their Lordships are of opinion that the drawing such an inference would be putting an unfair construction on Mr. Eckhofl's affidavit, especially as it is plain that he looked to hdr Sorensen, the father, to carry him through the transaotion and,beig rsonaUyknlown totheson,the laimantwoald beTvery lely to enterinto auyengagement withhimas to theoeanings of the ship. Afterwards, indeed, when upon the death of MIr. Sorensen, the father, in May, 1854, Mr. Eckhoff became somewhatanxious about the purchame-money of the ship, he did, by his agent, procure the claimant's acceptances falling due at six and nine months from the sale and transfer of the Andl, and a promise from the claimant that the earnings of the Anal should be applied to the lquidation of those acceptances, being the best security he could get. It appears that they wrere siO apphed, .vA that.

ment is the circumatanee above alluded to sin which this case is perhaVC distinguishable from the cases of the other ships, as to w hich the appropriation of the earnings formed part of the origial contract. It was urged, further, that the bill of sale of the Anial is untrae, because it states the whole purchase-money to be Paid. Their Lordship ar f oionthat there is no weight in this objecion Inallconeyacesof freehold or leasehold estates the urcasemony I alaysmentioned to have been fully pai, ad vt teremaybe a collateral instrumnet, showing

no ihRussian cargoes. Under thes circumistances the learned judge In the court below says :-"I sin inclined to hold the preoent sale (speaking of that of the Balties, one of the father's ships) was bond jdE." By which ther oedbis ndestnd imtomean Ltha th salewas eal Intnde to easthepretyi
,intere iin the ship remdn in the seUer at thie time of c
ture? And*hIs apoint .more diffcult of solution. The decisioa of the learned judge, that some interest did rematn tnihe seUer; rests almost entirely on the language used b- o.rd Stowell in the case of the --Secha Geschwisterna (4 Rob., 100) for, with the exception of that one, all the otier eases proceed on the ground of mot fida and collUasion.
.ord Stowell there says,-
" The rule which this country has been content to apply is, that property so transferred (this is, by purchae from an enemy) must be bond Pide and absolutely transferred; that there-must be a sale divesting the enemyof all further in. terest in it; and that anything tending to continue his inter. est vitiates a contract of this description altogether."
Applying that rule to the case then before him, Lord ftowell condemned the ship, and rightly so, because there 'were covenants in that case whichb preserved and retained the interest of the enemy seller, and for restution it the end of the war. It was a conditional, not an absolute sale. Lord Stowell concludes his judgment in these words -
"1In there in this any sign of a bodfidc trauisfer? Is not the hand of the French vendor stiUl on the vessel? Looking to the control which the French Government and the Tendor still retain over this property, it is impossble for nue to hold that all the interest of the enemy is completely divested.."
In the present case there is a total absence of any such covenant or condition. The utm-at that can be said is that there is an engagement on the part of the buyer to apply the earnings of the ship to the payment of part of the price. The mere non-psyment of a part of the price cannot of itseLf be sufficient to leave an interest in the'ship in the seller. That is distiuctly stated by Lord Stowell in the '&arlarime, " (6 Rob., 26):-
-" That objection can have little weight, since it is a matter solely for the consideration of the person who sells to judge what mode of payment he will adopt. He may consent to take a bil of exchange, or he Xay rely on the promissory note of the purchaser, which may not come in p.ayment ror a considerable time, or may never be paid. The Court will not look to such contingencies It will be ufcient that a legal transfer has been made, and thxt the mode of payment, whatever it is, has been accepted."
Here, however, there is more than mere non-payment of part of the price; there h an engagement to pay it out of the earnmngs, and that is contended to create an Interest in and lien on the freight, and, through the freight, on the ship. We must observe here that, even supposing that the facts of this case were sufficient to show that the vendor had a Len on the freight for the purchase-money, unpaid, it by no means follows that he had a lien on the ship. The ship and the freight are quite distinct ; the ship may belong to one person and the freight to another, and that not only for, asile voyage, but, as a security for a debt, for fature voyages, provided that the contract and asignment be not such as to separato the freight and earnin of the ship for ever from the ship itself, so that they could not be reunited, but only to separate them for the temporary purpose of securing a debt, and operating only upn that separation of title til that debt should be paid. The law on this subject was distinctly laid down, as stated above, by Lord Eldon in the case of the ship Warre, which I to be found in the notes toS Price, 269 The same doctrine was held in3Beavan, 342, "Stevenson v. Dowson in 1 Hare, 549, "Langton v. Horton in 1 Bingh . New Rep., 697, "Leslie and others v u Gnthle" and in other cases. There are no means by which, according to th contract, with Tespect to tho earnings stated in this case the ship could in any manner be affected, either in the Ad. miralty, the courts of common law, or the Court of Chan cery. It may be doubtful, considering the loose t,rms of the contract, and that it Wa made between foreigners,whether the Court of Chancery would interfero by ppomting a receiver of the freight, if the ship arrived in &gland and the owner had not applied the earnings towards pyment of the purchase-money. But, as between snglish subjects, if the Court interfered, it would not be in pursuance of the contract, but by reason of breach of contract. It was said in argument that by the law either of Russia or Denmark some lien might be crested on the ship, but that is a matter of foreign law, and therefore a fact to be proved by those who rely upon it, and no proof was offered. The difficulty, or rather the impossibility, of obtaining a satisfactory result by such inquiries appears to bave been one of the reasons why Lord Stowell, in the case of the "Tobago," to which we are about to allude more at length, refused to enter into them at all Supposing, however, that a lien on the freight or even on the ship, in favour of the vendor, who is to be considered as an enemy, did exist, would that lien render the ship in the possession of the netral owner liable to be captured ? That such a lien on an enemy's ship would not be sufficient to found
claim by a neutral m a court of prize is clear. It was sO held by Lord Stowell in the case of the " Tobago" (5 Rob, 218), which was the case of a British subject claiming in respect of a bottomry bond on a French enemy's ship which had been captured, and again in the case of the "M ariuna"n (6 Rob., 24). That was the case of a lieu on the freight and cargo of a ship, which ship was sold by an American neutral to a Spanish enemy, and the lien was in respectof part of the purchase-money remaining unipaid It is true that in I Spin}'s Admiralty Casesf 2f, the " Christine," the Court said that the doctrine in the
'arianna" did not a*pply to cases when the bona flde of theale was disputed, in which proof of actual payment is always essential; and no doubt that upon a question of bona ides such proof would be most important, and even essential. But the question of bona fides in this caso has been already disposed of; their Lordships are now considering the only point as to an mterest remaining in the bon4 fc seler. The xame doctrine as in the " Tobago" and the " Mari uma" is laid down by the Supreme Court of the United States of America in the "Frkancee' (Irvin's claim),e(8 Cranch's Rep. 417), and in "SanrJosd" (2 Gallison's Re 283), and other ease. Indeed, it was not disputed at the bar that such is the law of prze as regards a clrmnat in respect of I alien. But the oenverse of the proposion was contended
nottobe true, and that, although the lien of a neutral on an enemys ship or Its freight is not sufficient to found a claim, yet the lien of am enemy on a neutral ship or its freight is snfficient to show an interest in the enemy, of which the bellgerent captor is entitled to avail himself, and to defeat the neutral's claim; that a lien on an enemy's ship which would not be recognized in favour of a neutral would be recognized against a neutral for the purpose of condemnation, if the hen be in favour of an enemy. Their Lordships asked, and asked in vain, for some authority which went to establish that distinction. No sach authority was produced, but their Lordships were referred again to tne language of Lord Siowell, in the case of the "Sechs Geschwistern," which, as has been already observed, wasa uetion as to the right of property, not of lien. Their Lordships have been unable to find any authority for the alleged distnction, and, on the contrary, they are of opinion that the caes of the " Tobago" and of the " Frances" Irvin's clain), already cited, are plainly a-inst the distinction. In the " Tobago" the counsel for the captors argued, " Sappose a bond of this nature given upon a neutral slr'p, and to a person now become an enemy, could a proceeding of prize be instituted against the nentral , or any part of it, as the property of the enemy? CWr egry not. The counsel for the claimants arued, " With regard to the case put of an enems interest of this descnrption on a nentral ihip the distinction ig obvious, that this interest is a thing accessorial only to the ship; and that it might well consist with the principles of justice that the accessory might be restored though the ship was condemned, at the same time that it would not be reasonable or just to size the ship itelf on account of such an accessorial interest which an enemy might possess In it." Lord Stowell,in giving judgment, rays, "Can the Court recognize bonds of this i-Sd as titles of property, so ws to give persons a right to stand in judgment and demand restitution of such interests in a court of prizeI The total silence of those who had argued for the claimant as to any pcedents for this demand strongly shows that it has not
n the practice of the Court to consider such bonds as property entitled to ita protecion, and I think I may Tenture to say that there has been no such instance. The pereon advancing money on bonds of this nature ae9aires by that act noproperty in thevessel; he acquires the ua ad rem, but not the ins r, until it has been converted and appropriated by the final process of a court of justice. The property of the vessel continues in the former proprietor, who has given a right of action against it, but, nothing more. I there is no change of property, there can be no change of national character." An further, "The captor has no accesswbatever to the original private understanding of the parties in forming such contracts; and it is therefore unfit that he should be affected by them. His rights of capture act upon the property without regard to secret lienspossessedby third parties; in hliemanner his rights operate on no such liens where the roperty itself is pro tected from capture. Indeed, it weoad be almost impossible for the captor to discover such liens in the possession of the enemy upon property belonging to a neutral; the consequence, tfere , of allowg generally the privilege here claimed would be that the captor would be subject te the -disadvantage of having neutral liens set up to defeat his claims upon hostile property, while he could never entitle himself to any advantage from hostile liens apon n,eutral property." It is difficult to conceive stronger languae than this to showv that the distinction now attempte obe set up is wholly without foundation. The observations of th
same learned3jdge in the " Iariann" are substantially to the same effect Both these cases, itisto be observed, were decided subsequently to that of the 'Sechs Gschwister" The language of the Court in the "Frances" (Irvin's claim) (8 ranch's Rep 419), is equally strong: "In cases of liens crested by the mere private contract of individuals depending upon the different laws of different -countries, the difficulties which an examination of such
Caims would impose upon the captors, and even uppon the prize ours, in deciding upon t the door which
such a doctrine would open to ollusion between the enemy, ownes of the property, and neutral claimants, have excluded such cases from the on;sideration of those courts." Then, after referring to the cases of the "Tobg and the "M ianna," it is added, "Prom this it appears that the doctrine of the prize courts ugon this subject workg against as well asin favour of captors. TheirLordshipshaveroma to the conclusionthatthe supposeddistinctiondoesnotexist,and thlat liens, whether in favour of a neutral on an enemns ship, or in fxvour of an enemy on a neutral ship, are equay
tobe diregarded in a court of prize. One other argument was pressed arising from the number of vessels bought by the elsimant, and the magnitude of the transaction was insisted on; and the case of the " Rendsborg" (4 Rob., 121) was particularly adverted to. That case was such that Lord Stowell held it to amount to an adhering to and assisting the enemy, and it was of a very peculiar character. Their Lordships are unable to see why, if the transfer of one ship was legal under the circumstanes which have here occurred if ib bad stood alone, such transfer should be rendered illegal because aix other ships were purchased under similar eircumstances at the same time; unless, in. deed, as affording ground to believe that all the purchases were fraudulent and collusive. In effect, the whole case reolves itself into a uestion of boijff, and that being
once established their Lordshis fed obl to come to the oonclusion that the Ariel was the bond .de property of the claimant alone, and that no nterest remained in the seller, Mr. c3khoff. They must therefore humbly advise Her aestytha the dcon of theCourt below ought tobe i revered, ad the proeehda oSrthe ship resoed o the

This case occupied the attention of the Court until 6 o'clock, but the facts may be stated in a brief compass The insolvent who is a tobacconist, in Essex-street, Strand, was
Messr. b Howard and Child, the late churchwardens of the parish of St. ClemenS Danes. In 1854 a church-rate was made and levied, bnt very many parishioners refused to pay, upon the ground of its illegality. The mnatter created considerable excitement in the parish, and at a vestry meeting called to consider the subject the objeltors to the rate succeeded in passing a resolution, " that it was inexpedient to adopt proceedings for the recovery of church-rates." In 1855 Messrs. Howard and Child became churchwardenw and in November of that year an election of vestrymen and other officers took place under the Metropolis Local Management Act. The insolvent and others appeared to take part in the election, but the churchwardens refused to accept their votes, upon the ground of nonpayment of the church-rate. Upon this the insolvent and tho party with wbich he was connected, "the Beds," took proceedings in the Court of Queen's Bench, and a decision ws obtained that the parties were not disTaulified from voting by reason of the non-payment of chureh-rates Not content with this victory, " the Beds" brought 10 actions against tho churchwardens to recover compensation and the extra expense beyond the taxed costs paid by the defendants in te first proceedings. All those actions wsere subsequently consolidated in one brought iu. the name of the insolvent, upon the trial of which a verdict passed for the defendants, the churchv;ardens, the Court being of opinion that no malice wa p3<roved against them.

The provisions of the Charitable Trusts Act, enabling County Court judges to administer equitable relief to small cha-ities, and facilitating acces to the Court of Chancery, have been brought into general operation. The applications to the Courts for remedies are, it is feared, often prevented by the complexity of the mnode of procedure and the incidental costs it is suggested that the board itself might make orders for the appointment of trustees and the establishment of schemesa n nonoontentious cases, under proper restrictions and subject io appeaL A continual and rapid increase in the volntary transfer of funds of charities to " the official trustees of charitable fundsW is recorded. The total amount in the publo stocks transferred into the nam of the official trustees up to the 31at of December, 1856, is found to be 145,6021., of which U8,0M was transferred last year.

EXTRAORDMAlY OA.R
CRtIB2AL COlneT.-(BeforeC Ar. ust ice WnLES.)
James Tunnicliff, the keeper of a beershop, called the Royal Oak, at Thorney-lane, ner Newboroup.i, in ti,if county, was charged with obtainig divers sums of money! amounting in all to about 301., from Thomas Charlesworth, by false pretences-viz., by falsy pretending that the piosecutor (Thomas Charlesworth), his wife, child, cattle, horses, goods, and chattels were bewitched; that his (Thomas Charlesworth's) mother had procured several psxttons named (Bull and Cotton) to put upon them the spell aned charm of witchcraft; and that he (the prisoner) had the power to remove and free them from it. The indicinent, of course, negAtived the various false pretenees.
This case has excited the greatest interest in this countty DOt only from the condition of the prosecutor, who is a sub.
thntial farnier, but also from the length of time the pri. soner succeeded in keeping up his absurd delusioni, nua the substantial profit be derived from it. The court wat densely crowded throughout the trial, the audience inclading a considerable number of " witches."
Mr. Scotland and Mr. Macnamar appeared for the prose' cution; lr. Skinner and Mr. Davis 'instructed by MrX George Palmer, of Rugeley) defended the prisoner.
Mr. SCOTLANsD, in opening the case, stated that it was one of a most extraordinary character, and probably the jury would learn for the first time that there wero stilt living in this country those who believed in witchcraft, and that therewere cunning and designing persons who were rad to take advantage of such credulity to turn it to their ovrn profit. The learned counsel then proceeded to state the lacit of the case as they were proved in evidence. it ap; peared that the prosecutor's milk and cheese were spoiled, and the dairymaid wr.s ill, and, the prosecutor not being able to account for it, be was led by his servant to believe that the cheese, &c., was bewitched, and to send for the prisoner to get rid of the bewitchment. The prisoner came, and at once told the prosecutor that he (the X- cutor), his wife, horses, cattle, cheese, and cheese. kettle (laughter) were bewitched, and obtained 7t. from him to cure them of the witchery. The prisoner succeeded in gettingUinto the prosecutor's employ, and by working on his delusons he obh tained various sums of money, amounting to nearly 301. The prosecutor and his wife and servants suffered at various times from iliness of a peceliar character, whicE there was reason to believe was brought on br drugs ad ministered by the prisoner. The prisoner told the prosecutor that his mother hd got three persons, named Boll, Cotton, and Wilson, to put the spell upon him and eve
thing in the house. Ultinately the procutor's vchd died.
ir. SEZBm here gaid he hoped the learned counsel wrs not going to open a charge of murder, as that would prejudice the interests of the prisoner.
Mr. Justice WILLEs said he understood the learned counsel introduced the matter in order to negative the defence which Mr. Skinner might probably set up, that the prisoner had the power which he pretended to posses.
. SCoMaND sd he should prove that the prisoner had in his house certain roots and herbs, ursual with persons who pretended to witchcraft, though he did not suggest that the prisoner had made use of them. The learned counsel then proceeded to contend that it was absurd to suppose that thero was such a thing as witchcraft, and said he should show that the prisoner must have known that what he attributed to witchcraft wAs the result of merely physical and natural causes. The learned counsel was about to contend that it was no defonce to say that ordinarry m deuce might have protected the prosecutor from imposition.
MIr. Justice WILLES said all the old cases were overruled. It was safficient now if there be any false representstion which was suiacient to take anybDd in, be he tool or be he wise.
The following witnesses were then called.-
Thomas Charlesworth, the prosecutor, a very respectable. looking young man, was examined by Mr. RIANAckRA. He said,-I am a farmer, and live at Bromley hurst, in this county. I was married at the end of J8. My mother at that time was living with me, and left in the following February. She said she would take my two little brothers away from me, and I said she should not. There were some words between us, and she left. In April wo could not et the cheese to turn, and the dairymaid (Catherine Charles. worth) was very ill. I could not account for the cheese not turning. At that time a man named Thomas Sammons was at work on my farm. In consequence of a conversation with him I went to the prisoner's hous, on Saturday, the 26th of ApriL He lived atThorney.lane. about four miles from my house. He kept a beerhouse. I had known him seven or eight years Mly wife acompanied me. Isaw the prisoner, and told him we could not get the cheese to curd, and the dairymaid -was il, and that Mrs. Willatts and Sammons said it was bowitched (laughter),and that Sammons told me he was in the habit of stopping such things as witchcraft. He said he would come over in the morning, and he should be able to tell me what was the matter, and who had done it. He said he mnst ten his wifehe was coming to look at some calves, or she would not let him come for that purpose-the stopping the witchcraft. The next morning he came into my house and saw me. When he came in he said all my cows tied up by the neck were bewitched. They gave the milk. He said two horses and myself were bewitched, my wife, the dairymaid, and the cheese kettle. (IAughter) He had not seen the cows nor the cheese-kettle. He said he could stop it by my paying 3e. 6d. for each of the cattle, 5s. for myself, 5s. for the dairymaid, and 5s. for the cheese. kettle. (Laughter.) There were 27 cows tied by the neck He wanted all the namesof thecows put down. He said he could free my wife b taking one bit out of her dress. He said my mother had had a broad hand on me, and had only put her finger on her. He said it was my mother who had
one it. I gave him all the names of the cows, and paid him the money, amounting altogether to about 61. or 71. He ak*ed me to write a letter to a man named Conway, in London, for a spell-book, to set the cattle free. I wrote the letter, and he took it away. He said he mnst see the horses before he went. I went with him, and he laid his hands on them. He then left. Be said the dairymaid must go away. The next day the dairymaid was no better, and the cheese was no better. (Laughter.) I went next day and told him so. He said he would come over next morning and see to it. I had two cups of ale. On my way home I was took very ilL I had sbootln painsin my chest, and mi head was very bad.
Ffigothome I was taken with shaking and shivering. The prisoner came the next day, and saw mne in bed, be.- tween 8 and 12. He said I must get up and have a little brandy. He said he had been round by IJttoxeter, or he would have been sooner. He said he did not think r should have been so bad, but I should soon be better. He did not say why I had been so bad. He said the reason was because he had had a contest with old Bull of Yeaverley, and he had beat him. He said my notber had done it, and sho had set Bul on. The prisoner then remained several days at my house. I got but very little better. I continued poorly. My mother had been at my house on the preIolus Sunday. I mentioned that to the prisoner. He said she hia put a curse on everything, and he must have more money to free all the young cattle. He charged me 3s. 6d. a-pieee for aUl the sheep, stirks, and calves, and 5s. for the goods and chattels. (Laughter.) I paid for 50 sheep, 12 stirks, 11 calves, and 12 pigs. (Laughter.) I
pid 3s. 6d. for the pigs. He charged me Gs. for my baby. Laughter.) I paid about 161. on this oceasion. (This evience was objected to, but after a long discussion was admitted.) Shortly after this the prisoner came into my house as a servant. That was a few days after. He remained till the 7th of February in this year. During that time I had five attacks of illness; the symptoms were generally the same as at the first. When I was attacked the second time the prisoner said my mother had been to a man at Longton, named Cotton, and she had set Cotton to do it. Ee said he must go and soe Cotton, which I suppose he did. He afterwards told me he and his wife had been to see him, and it cost him 11. I did not pay him that. He said Cotton had charged 1. to show books against him. He said he (prisoner) bad beaten him. On tho third attack I conversed with the prisoner about it, and be said my mother had done it, and she had been to a man at Badley Hedge, and there were two working against me and my wife and baby, that they were putting witcheraft upon me. I and my wife went witn him to see the man. We went to Froghallstation. The prisoner said we must vwit at the station while he went to see Arnold. He went to Badlev Hedge, and then came back and said that Arnold lived at ingsloy. Beforeho leff us at the station he said my wife must not fear i she felt anything. He asked me for 10s. to gt admitted at Arnold's house, to show books w1b him. I gave it him. He stayed away about half - hour. He then said there had been two at work, and t
was wby my wife was so bad. He said he could beatthe other man without going to him. My wife was taken hry ill, d lilkewise the baby. The symptoms were the sake as I ad had. She was taken with sbivering and shaki f He said there were two working on us at that time, ani that was the reason my wife was so ill On die fourth attack the prisoner said my mother had been to a nan at Burton, named Plinmer, in Bond-street. He aid he must go and see Plimmer. He wanted 5e. to see llimmer. I gave it him. He went away, and shortly afte*rards returned. He had said he would bring the young bian for us to see, but when he came back he wi the oouug tan would not come, and ho had brought the old one An old
man came with him and went into th koom with him. The prisoner on the 5th of Januai appenred
t) be taken ilL. He came from home' and said the witchcraft was on himself, and he hid had two very bad nights, and that it was Cotton vrho ias doing it and that if lie did not go to Longton he shinld die. Hge seemed to be shivering, as I wwa. He wante? 31. 10s. to go to Longton. He said that Was to have the vitcheraft taken off. When he came back he said he was otliged to get the uperintendent of police to break his (Cottin's) door open, and that he (the prsoner) had been very iliM Longton, and obliged to have the doctor. He said it wal through having had a contest with Cotton. He said he had seen Cotton, and that the plice went in with him, nd that Cotton was very stubborn. On the fifth attack (on the 8th of February) I sent for the prisoner. Wlen he came he said my mother had buen to a man at Derby, that I mnst be two or three days, and he woula trytoAeat him without going to see him. He aid my mother had been to Derby to see a man named WiLson to aet the witchcraft on. On the 10th he said he must go to Derby, ani I weent with him as far as Burton. My wife went with him, and said she would go, as she was determined to se i he (prisoner) was correct. I pa emy wife S. Oa hisretnn he said be hadad a conkest with Wilon, but he had b*n very stubbomn, and he would finish him In thre day (Laughter.) the 8th of lebruary prisonlec beoubtsny btrekfaaf iat.~rooms.

tlbt the same symptoms as before. I sent for a sargeon, Mr. Higgins. I was very ill. My wife then fetehed the prisoner, and when he came I asked him what was the reason I had been so ill, and had so many attacks. He said itvwas through the man Wilson dying, and 1 should be better now. I aiterwards ordered the prisoner not to come on my premiscs-that was on the 17th of February. There had been a complaint by the servants. I was better before the doctor came.
Cross-examined by Mr. SKIxN-Eu.-In four hours I was well. I do not know wbether Mr. Biggins is here, and that is as true as the rest I have said.
Mr. SCOTLASI) objected to the question in that form.
Mr. Justice WVILr.S said that was a common form. Laughter.)
Cross-examination continued.-Sammons is not here. I aTn 28. I am the owner of the farm, about 40 aeres. My mother seemed to be offended at my marriage. She did not say that was why she left me. She went to live with my grandmother. She said I should not make any cheese, and it would all tumble to pieces. She came and said I should never do any good, and the cheese should all tumble to pieces. (Laughter.) I don't know whether sbe said she hoped I might lie in bed and rot and nobody would come to help me. hMy wife or servants told me she said so. Whea my mother said that the cheeses fell to pieces 1 recollect four of them fell to pieces. I did not know what to think of it. I almost think I went to Tunnicliffe the day my mother left. My mother left on the 10th of March, 1856. On thatday her message was brought to me. She returned and said the cheeses should faU to pieces. The dairymaid was taken iU a few days ber -re I went to the prisoner. Ie told ue I must dismiss the b airymaid; sbe must go off the place or she would die, and I dismissed her accordingly. He did not say I must dismiss her because she could not make cbeeses. When I went to the ptisoner I told hin I thought there was something wrong; that Xmrs. Willatts said I was bewitched. I did believe I was bewitched, or I should not have gone to the prisoner. Mrs. Willatts is a neighbour. She is as wise as her neighbours, for what I know. (Laughter.) Mr. Charleswortb, of Bike-end, my wife's fatber, had sent for a Mr. Elarrison. He is a wizard. They are not lke blackkSgTies. (Laughter.) I am not a wizard myself. (Laughter.) I have said I was afraid my father was in the same way as I was. (Laughter.) I am right now, Sir. (Laughter.) I am not bewitched now. I have not been bewitched. I have been dosed. I know Talbot. I saw him, and he said he would have cured the witcheraft for me if he had been sent for, and he would have kicked Tunnicliff off the place soon. I thought my father was bewitched, because he was in a poor low way. I don't remember that he died of ddirium tsoenwns. He died eight or nineyears ago. He used to get drunk sometimes. Sometimes I take something to drink. I get a little fresh sometimes, but not drunk. On the 10th of February I did not get drunk and lose my hat on the way home. Once I lost my hat. The wind blew it of. Sometimes I keep a bottle bylmy bedside. It contains brandy, or perhaps a little gin. Sometimes we have a little brandy and sometimes a little gin. My "missus" takes a little. (Laughter.) We take it if we are unwell, sometimes two or three times in the night. I had upset my trap, but I was not drunk. The horse was frightened. I did not tell Mr. Hall the prisoner's landlord, that the prisoner had had neither money, cheese, nor bacon from sme, but was working regularly on the farm. Mr. HaU was going to give the prisoner notice because he had heard these tales of witchcraft. This paper is in my handwriting. I wrote to contradict the reports in the TJttoxeter newspaper. The prisoner askeed me to write it, and said they would transport him if I did not. I said I would build a bouse for the prisoner. The prisoner said he had 1001. he should like to lay out. I don't recollect saying to Mr. Edward Bannister that I never gave him money, cheese, or bacon. I have said so, because the prisoner said if I said anything about money he would be transported for seven years. I should not have gone against the prisoner if I had not found him out. When the prisoner left on the 17th of February I reckoned with him, and found him lSs. 6d. in my debt. What I bad paid him to get rid of the bewitchment was not included. I have been to the prisoner's house, the Royal Oak. I paid him for what ale I had. I have been there with my wife and little brother and Miss Coates. I took a little brandy in my pocket. J had been very il, nd Mr. Higgins recommended me to have a little brandy. I never said to Edward Bannistez I would sell my wife for a shilling. I have never been downright drunk in Bannister's presence. Mr. Cope came one night to my house. The neow dairymaid, Ann Ricbardson, told me that my dog had gone through the house and appeared all on fire. She said there appeared to be a ball of fire behind lhim. Some one said the house was all lighted by the fire. I was very ill Mr. Cope came over to me on the 11th of Februarv. I don't recollect telling him I was bewitched
siain. I don't remember his saying " Oh, nonsense I"
said the dog had had somethiDg given to her, and sbe would die. I did not say the dog had had rabbits' entrails and had had too much. I did not say we had drunk al the brandy. My wife asked him if he had any. I did not pour out what there was and drink it myself. I do not recollect my wife saying to Cope that the house would have fallen down just now if we had not said the Lord's Prayer, for there had been a noise like an earthquake. I don't undertake to say it was not said. I have two dogs. I was sober. We v,ere not all drunk. I had only a little drop of ale, and Mr. Cope asked us to have some gin. My wife sent for a lawyer to make my will. That was the night I said my father was in the same way as myself. Air. Barvey was by. Mr. Cope gave us some gin, and I and my wife took it neat. I had not told Cope six weeks before I went to the prisoner that I had been bewitched and that I attributed it to my mother. I swear I was not drunk for several days before the Ilth. I had a sup on the 10thsome brandy at Burton-with the prisoner. I did not throw rmy boot at the servant that night. Mr. Cope has not advised us to eat more and drink less, and we should be better. Nor did farmer Brown. Brown said I was a fool for going to Tunnicliff, aud ought to kick him off the place, for he was doing the witchcraft. He did not say it was dedi-iusn treemncs, and it would kill me if I continued drinking. I told Mr. Pott that when I was going to Tunnieliff's tsaw a wanderer on the road, and my garters came untied, and that I was bewitched. (Laughter). I don't know how they became untied. (Laughter.) I lost one calf before I went to Tunnichff. Tunnicliff drenched two that were ill and cured them the first day he came to work. I don't believe in the witching now, not since my wife went to Derby, and found there was no man named Wilson. That was the 16th of February. I did not tell farmer Pott a fortnight ego that I had got a lamb bewitched. Pott said the lamb was bewitched, and he had bimself been bewitched several times. The prisoner has a daughter. She is subject to fits. I had not put on a white sheet and gone after her to the pump to frighten her. (The witness hesitated). I may uave done it to one of the servants sometimes. I bave not done it to the girl in bed. I have heard her complain. I believe she had two or three fits at our house. She wassubject to them before she came. One night my wife was shaken very badly with shivers, the same as 1 was. The prisoner worked with me as a labourer. He went home when he lked. He (Tunuicliffe) gave me this printed paper, and said he composed it. (It was some doggrel verses about witchcraft.)
Ro-exaimined by Mr. SCOTLAND.-While prisoner was with me I had two pigs il, and seven cows slipped their calves.
By a Juror.-The cheeses fell to pieces in a fortnight after they were made. They cracked as they were on the floor. Sometimes they did not come well. I never had a eheese crack before.
Elizabeth Cbarlesworth, examined by Mr. SCOTLAYD, said she was the wife of the prosecutor. There had been something the matter with the cheese before we went to the prisoner. We could not get the cheese to come, and the dairymaid was unwell. Sainmon said the prisoner would cure it. The risoner told us to turn the dairymaid away. We did that the same night. but the cheese continued bad. On the 28th of April I was very unwell. I had a great deal of shaking and pains, and so had the child too. Tho prisoner had been there on the 27th of April. We heard knocks that night, but could not tell where. Another night, on the 28th, we heard the cows all lament, and the horses prancing, the dog howline, and a many strange noises. There was something about 3 o'clock that was louder than the dog. The men were call d u,. I asked the men to drive it away. I heard it no mere. in the morning I told the prisoner. He looked sleepy. He said he knew we should have an awful night, but he dursn't tell us for fear of putting us in bad spirits. One night he took a knife and plate, and asked me and my husband to go into a room with him and he would show us all our enemies; but we were too il to go. He would not let Mrs. Copestake go with him. When be came out of the room there was a blueness over him. When he went in he said it would be either death or glory to him, and when he came out he said he had succeeded. Ile said it was his (prosecutor's) mother who had done it on us, and the brother on the stock. In bed one night (the Thursday night) after I was asleep I was snatched up in bed as straight as I am now, and I was shaken all to death. The prisoner was in our room sleeping there. We had no spare room. He said he would stay with us a few days till we were better. I asked the ptisoner what he was doing, and h lBi the canedle. He got out of bed and lit tho candle. I was 'very ill. The Prisoner camne to the bed and brought my Bible. He said it had been with old Bull, of Yeaverley, and that was why I was shaken so. (Sensation.) When I asked what he 'was doing he,said nothing was the matter, I must go to Bleep again. When the prisoner camne to meI askelhm to giv me- a- litlea
wanted theoBible to take to old Bull, and that was why I vas shaken so. I had several attacks, all shaking. I saw my husband pay the prisoner on the 27th, and also a week after. The witness confrmed the evidence of her husband about
their going to the FroghaU station, to see Arnold and another man; and also about their going to Burton to see the man Plimuner to free them; and as to the prisoner's story about taking the police to break open Cotton's door at Longton. She then gave an account of her going with the
prisoner to Derby to see a man named Wison. The prisEOner left her at an inn, and returned in half an hour, and then accompanied her into the town, and pointed out the
house wbere the man lived. In a week the witness went to Derby again, to the house next door but one, and asked who lived in the housepointed out, but she was told that no person named Wilson 'lved there. But she did not apply at the house itself.
Cross-examined by Mr. Sxieisrnxe-My cbi'd was seven mon ha old when it died. It was nursed by me. It died of cov&ulasions two days after the prisoner brought me the Bible. Dr. Higgins attended the child. He is sot here. The baby was a very stout baby till I knew the prisoner. My wothor-in-law was not pleased at our marriage. I believe she wished that we might rotin bed, and that nobodymightoome to help us. She sid weshould neverdo anygood, anell the
eheeses would tumble to pieces. Before we sent to Tunni. cliff we could not make the cheese come. I engaged a dairymaid from my mother. There was one cheese very bad before the prLioner came. The prisoner took four cheeses away. I don't know that four cheeses were bad.
the dairyseaid came befcre we sent to Tunniciff. The dairymaid was ill and the c-:, es had got " the hoost"before the prieoner came. We thought they were bewitched. The prisoner told me if I did not send the dairyinaid away that
tdght bhe wouWld be a wAnilhgr, I sent her to my mother's
that riLht, before 6. She had been in a wild, queer way. 31y shngs lasted for two hours. There were like cats fighting in the room. I can't tell what abook rme, whether itwas a spirit or not. No man could shake me as I was shaken. (Laughter.) I went better after the prisoner lighted the candle. A little spirits (brandy) soothed me, and I went better. (Laughter.) The yells were like unto a dog, but louder. The well went away when my mnau (the carman) bid 't go Hoi othr to-day. We believed that we were bewitched from April 1856, till February 11, 1857. I never take spirits, except when I bave spasms. I did not see the fiery dog come into the h ouse, but I saw the blaze. I saw our dog, and then a dog after it on fire. (Laughter.) I saw the blaze, but not the dog. Our dog then sat down on his hind legs, with his tongue out, and his paws banging down. (Laughter.) It seemed d3ing. The girl, Ann Richardson, who saw the fire
dog, is here. She saia if I did not send.the prisoner away, I sbe would go. The prisonaer was then dismissed, the day afterI had been to Derby. On the 11th of February I
wished my husband to make his will, but he wished me to I tell the man to make haste, or he would not see hiTn alive. We sent for Mr. Cope on the 11th, becauso we were so terrified. I cannot tell what was said, I was so terrified at seeing my husband so ill, and the noises together. My husband has brandy sometimes; be is so troubled with the wind. (Laughter. Itake itfor thespasms. ; and befor the wind. (Laughter.) Brandy always relieves us. (Laughter.) I asked Mr. Cope for a sup of brandy, because we had none in the house. That night there was an awful shake at the door, and we said the Lord's Pray er. We went over to Mr. Cope's. I showed my tongue to Mr. Copto see how parched up it was. He gave me oneoglass of neat gin. I declined the water. The prisoncr made this song, and gave me 2s. towards having it printed. It ^ost 4s. I never heard it on the dulcimer. The prisoner's daughter was very had while she was at our house. I never sawf my husband in a. white sheet. She was frightened at Mrs. Coates's and my husband was there. She had hysterics that night
Re-examined by Mr. MACNAMA1iA.-The prsoner took away the four cheesesto bury them.
Elizabeth Hesketh, exau ined by Mr. MACNAMARA, said, -I was in the service of the prosecutor as nurse in 1856. I remember on one occasion in April the prisoner asked me for a plate and knife. He took it into the house. I saw a blaze and a smoke in the room where he was. He made wooden crosses and stuck them over the doors.
Cross-examined by Mr. SiaNEBit.-Wben he came out of the room he appeared as he did before. He worked regularly on the farm as a servant.
Re-examined by Mr. ScoTLA2D.-He was a good deal in the house, and slept there all the time.
Ann Richardson, examined by Mr. ScOTrnAom, said,-I went into the prosecutors service last New Year's-dav. On the 8th of February my master was taken very ilL The prisoner tool his breakfast to him that morning. Se made the tea and took it with eggs and bacon upstairs. In about half an hour my master said he felt very poorly. He com-
lamned of his head and stomach. I was taken ill the same ay. The prisoner breakfuted with me. I had coffee. In about half an hour I felt poorly. I had pains in my head and stomach. I felt sick. The prisoner went home. I was worse on the I1th, and my master too. The prisoner came on the 10th and said I should be better after that day. They went to Derby. The next morning the prisoner made the breakfast and took it up. The same day the prosecutor went out. He returned at 4 in the afternoon, and was taken very ill in his head and stomach. The dog was very bad. The same night the master was very ill, and we heard sometbng come into the yard lik-e a carriage. Something came in the passage like the wind. There was our dog and the sbape of another dog after it all on fire. Our dog went behind the door in the yard with his tongue out. I did not see what became of the fiery dog. (Laughter.) The prisener on Sunday night asked me to make him some tea. I refused, because I thought he had dosed me or bewitched me. (Laughter.) I complained to my master, and after that the prisoner left on the 17th of February.
Cross:examined by Mr. SnENm.--I had some words with the prisoner. My master apd mistress had told me the prisoner bad recommended them to send me away from my place. He had said he had found out something about me and the cowman, and I gave .him a bit of my mind. (Laughter.) My master only took a meat-spoonfull of brandy when he was poorly. My master had had some drink on the 10th-some little. I don't know how a man looks when he has had some little-I leave that to your judgment how you look. (Iaughter.) Both the dogs came in trgether. I don't know what became of the " shape of the dog." I bad never seen i "fire dog" before. I saw it quite plainly. Only me and master's brother saw it. It came in at the door. I followed it. It went behind the door that was shut. I could not think how the dog got through. (Laughter.) I did not smell any brimstone. (Laughter.) Our dog sat behind the door with his tongue out. It seemed to me a quarter of a yard long. (Loud laughter.)
John Anderson, examined by Mr. BUCNAYAsiA, said,-I am a police superintendent at Burton. There is a place called Bond-end, but not Bond-street, at Burton. There is no person named Plimmer lives there.
Elizabeth Charlesworth, examined by M1r. SCOTLA-D, raid,-I am a widow and the mother of the urosecutor. HE married in December, 1855. I left him in larch, 1856. I bave known the prisoner by sight, and seen him about. I have never said anything to him about bewitching or witch. craft. I have never attempted to do any injury to my son by witehcraft. I do not know anything of a man named Arnold or Bull of Yeaverley, or Wilson or Plimmer at Burton, nor have I mentioned thair names to the prisoner.
Cross-examined by Mr. SuRnmR.-I was not dissatisfied with my son's marriage. I never said my son would never dowell, northat he would never make any cheese,-it would all tumble in pieces. I did not came about the marriage. I left because I thought I -would give place to her. I never threatened the cheese. I had had a few words about taking away the two little boys. My husband was ill eight months.
By the JuDaE.-I had lived eight years with my son. I managed the house for him.
Ellis Crisp, a police inspector at Rugeley, apprehended the prisoner on the 25th of February. In his house he found a root (briony), some leaves, and the printed paper produced.
Dr. Monkton, of Rugeley, examined by Mr. ScorwA,n,
said he had heard the evidence, and he could not form any opinion of what had caused the symptoms. He had formed an opinion on the evidence given before the magistrates. The root is the white briony (dr&mia di*ica). It has irri. tating properties.
This being the case for the prosecution,
Mr. SscN,XB said it was laid down that the false pretence must be a false pretence of an existing fact; bat it was impossble that witchcraft could be an existing fact, for it was now recognized by the law that witchcraft could not exist.
Mr. Justice WrLLXS said he was of opinion that the case came within the statute, but that if, on consulting Mr Justice Crowder, his lTordship should be of a different opi nion, he (Mr. Justice Willes) would reserve the point.
Mr. S1UNNER then addressed the jury for the defendant. He said this case illustrated an old saying, that one fool made many; and tbe worst that could be said against the prisoner was that he had accepted what the prosecutor had said respecting him. It appeared the cheese had for several days been bad, and their man Sammons had told them that it was bewitched. But where was Sammons ? Why was he not called? The prosecutor's mother had denied what the prosecutor had attributed to her about the cheese. That showed the delusions under which the prosecutor himself was labouring before he wen5 to the prisoner, and that he had induced the prisoner to believe what he himself represented to him. When the prisoner came to the house he advised the prosecutor to get rid of an incompetent dairymaid, and he cured the calves. Another dairymaid was engaged, and at length she was got rid of; and after that there was no complaint made of the cheese, and the reason was that a competent servant was employed. The prosecutor's child died oflconvulsions,-au ordinary disease, but the doctor who attended the child was not called. The reason probably was that he would have been able to prove that the prosecutor and his wife were suffering from deliriu(m trememns, brouRht on by their drink. ing habits. The seene in the bedroom was merely the effect of anhysterical fitandthespasms, whichseemed alwaystocome onwhenthebrandywaswanted. Didthe jury believeaword spoken by the girl Ann Richardson about the " fiery dog." The only question was vwhether it was true that when the prisoner left and went throuah the account with the pro. secutor he had worked out a5l the money he had received from the prosecutor. The prisoner could not be caUed to give his version of the case, so that it rested entirely on tle evidence of the prosecutor. He would therefore call Mr. Cope to show the state in which the prosecutors were on the night when they went to his house; and he would call upon them to say that no credit was to he given to their state.
Samuel Cope, examined by Mr. DAVIS, said,-I am a farmer living within a few yards of the prosecutor's house. I was called to his house at between 8 and 9 o'clock on the 11th of February. The prosecutor and his wife were there and Mss Richardson. The prosecutor had the brandy bottle in one hand and the glass in the other. He asked me if I would have some brandy. He was drunk. I said I would not have any, andbhe drank it himself. He asked me if I
ad anybrandy, and Isaid I bad not. Be said there was like 20 carages coming in the yard. He then said he was so bewitched that he thought the house would have fallen on them. Mrs. Charlesworth said it would bave fallen down if they had not said the Lord's Prayer. I saw nothing the matter. I saw the dog fed with rabbits' entrails. The dog was afterwards in a bad state. The prosecutor and hiq vife came to my house. They said
toev durst not stop. She wanted to send for a lawiyr. to make his will. She said their mother had done it al. She said their mother's family were all given to witchoraft, aid were Ull bad ones.

XINGSTO, MARCH 23.
(Before Mr. Justice CRESSWELL and a Common Jury.)
DAVIS AND A-NOTHER V. CATLING.
This was an action to recover 1061. upon a guarantee alleged to have been given by the defendant, who pleaded that the signature to the gutarantee was a forgery.
Mr. T. Chambers (the Common Serjeanst for the city of London) andl Mr. Malcolm were counsel for the plaintifs; Serjeant Ballantins and Mr. Garth appeared for the de-
fendant.
The plaintiffs are the highly respectable firm of Davis and Co., warehousemern in the city; and it appeared that in 1855 a person named George Hlatton the son-in-law of the defendant, who carried on a drapery business at Beaconsfield, apphed to then to furnish him with goods upon credit; but, as they were aware tkat lhe had been a bhankrupt some time before, they declined to do io except under a guarantee, and he undertook that the defendant, who was his father-in-law, and a person of some property, should be his security. A guarantee in the usual form was accordingly sent by post to Beaconsfield, where the defendant had resided, and in due course it came back, aptarently signed by him. Goods were supphed under t is guarantee, and George Hatton subsequently got into diffliculties, and could not answer his liabilities, and therefore the action was brought to recover the amount for which the defendant was supposed to have rendered himself responsible under the guarantee.
Some witnesses were called to support the plaintiff's ease, who stated that they were aware that the defendant had been in the habit of ssisting his son-in-law, and they expressed a belief that the signature to the guarantee was the handwriting of the defendant. In the course of a searching cross-examination by Mr. Serjeant Ballantine it was admitted that the defendant had refused to pay several bills of exchange that purported to have been accepted by him, and that George Hatton had sent the money to the London and County Branch Bank at Windsor to meet them. It also appeared that George Hatton was out of the way, and that the attorney for the plaintiffs had been unable to serve him with a subpoena to attend and give evdence upon this trial.
Mrs Harriet Hatton, a young woman, who gave her evidence in a very confused and excited manner, was called as a witness, and she stated that the defendant was her fatber, and she was the wife of George Hatton. She said that her father was in the habit of assting her husband to carry on his business, and used t visit them at Beacons-
ield and stayed occasionally for a month or more at their house, and she believed he was there in July, 1855, when this guarantee was given. She knew her father's handwriting, and she believed that the signature to the guarantee was written by him, and she said she had frequently heard her father say that he had no objection to tssist er husband, provided he did not get him into trouble.
In cross-examination Mrs. Hatton said she did not know where her husband was now, and the last time she saw him was a week ago, in London. She denied that her husband was in the habit of opening letters addressed to her father, but admitted that al her father's letters were addressed to their house. A letter was shown her which she admitted ahe had sent to her sister, and in which she had implored her to ask her husband to intercede with the defendant and endeavour to induce him to pay the money, as, if there was any inquiry in a court, the result must be that her own husband would be transported for 14 years. She also stated in this letter that if she was called into court &a witness she did not think she should be able to go through with what would be required of her. She said that she could not explain what she meant by say-
ing that if there was any inquiry in court her husband' would be transDorted for 14 years, but her object in writing the letter was that her relatives miebt intercede with her father and induce him to pay the money
SerjeantBALsrn~ then askced the wvitness whethershe would sw ear upon her solemn oath that she believed the signature to the guarantee was the handwriting of her father.
She replied that the signature was like his handwriting.
Seijeant BAiaAN=E said that answer would not do for him, Would Ehe swear upon her solemn oath that she believed the signature to be her father's handwriting? and he cautioned her to be careful how she answered the question.
Mrs. Hatton gave the same reply, that the signature was like her father's writing, and therefore she believed it to be his.
Mr. Justice CRESSWELL addressed the witness, and told her to remember that it was a very serious matter, and he then asked her whether she would pledge her oath to her belief that the signature to the guarantee was her father's
handwriting.
MIrs. Hatten replied that she thought it was her father's - signature, bult her belief was not founded entirely upon her knowvledge of his handwriting, hut upon other circumstances.
In further cross-examination by Mr. BALLym-E Mrs. Hatton said that there was a meeting of the family and other parties to take into consideration the subject of this guarantee, but she did not remember that her hus_band went down on his knees and implored her father to pay the money. She also did not remember hearig him ask one of his sisters to endeavour to induce her father to acknowledge the guarantee, and say at the same time, " Only consider wbat a dreadful thing it would be to have a brother transported," but he might have done so, and she would not swear he did not.
Mr. CHEMuERS having intimated that the plaintiff's case was closed,
Mr. Justice CRSs:wEgLL observed that there was very slender evidence to go to the jury.
Mr. CHAMBERS admitted it was so. The plaintiffs attpeared to have been defrauded, but they were quite justified m briDgig the action.
Mr. Justice CRESSWELL said there was no imPutation wbatever upon them, but they had failed in making out their case.
The plaintiffs were accordingly nonsuited.

This was an action brought by a solicitor and money scrivener of this town to recover the amount of two bills, the defendant beng sued as the endorser of one and the E *cceptorof tho otuer. The defence Fst up was based on
the alleged forgery of one or both of these instramentg by one Harradine, who had absconded after having become a bankrupt. The learned counsel, however, for the defendant ultimately withdrew from the cause, and a verdict passed for the plaintiff forthe full amount of his dem and.

John Johnson, aged 20, John Smith, aged 20, and James Miller, aged 24, were indicted for a highway robbery, accompanied by violence,in this town, on the night of the l2th of January, and James Williams, aged 60, was charged with receiving part of the stolen property.
Mr. Cooper and Mr. Hillam Mills were counsel for the rosecution; Mr. Naylor defended Smith and Mlller; Williams was not represented by counseL Thompson pleaded " Guilty."
The prosecutor, Mr. Ambery, is an under-gradoate of St. John's College, and was proceeding from the Market-place to King's-parade, through St. Edward's-pasage, at 11 o'clock at night, and bad just entered into the passage when an arm was suddenly thrown round his neck and gradually tightened till he lost all consciousness and fell senseless to the ground. During the operation, however, the prosecutor distinctly beard the voices of two men saying," Come on," and II've got it," while he felt a tug at his watch and a hand in his breeches pocket. On recovering his senses he found himself in the tap of a publichouse, in the passage, together with the prisoner Jobnson and two strarugers namned Scott and Jones; and on searching his pockets found that bis watch was gone and some halfpence, but nota purse containing 27s., which was with the halfpence, and he also missed his scarf and gold pin. Erom the evidence of Mr. Scott, who is the under-porter of JesusCollege, it appeared that as he was walking up Union-street towards tbe point where St. Edward's-psa enters the Market-place he met two men, closely resembling Miller and Smitb, running away, and heard the one say to the other, "Come on, Joem. rve got it." This attracted his attention, nd as he heard a scuffling sound immaediately after, he hastened to the entrance of the passage, where,jatA round the corner, hesaw Johnson intheact of taking something out of the pocket of the prosecutor, thenlying senseless onthe ground. Scottat oncescared the ruffianfrom his prey, and pursned him up the passage. Fortunately, two men ha ppned to be just then at the top of the passage, and JomsLon, turning back, dealt Scott a blow with a stick and passed him. By that time other wayfarers had congregated at the entrance, so that the thief was caught in a trap; but, determined to die hard, he retraced his steps towards Scott, who, after a violent struggle. succeeded in capturing him. Among the folks attracted by the disturbance was a gentleman named Jones, who, on coming out of the publichouse, observed Miller and Smith standing in the passage. As soon as they saw him they moved off across the Market-place, into St. 3Mary's-passage to an inn called the Dog and Dac,k but being unable to gain an entrance they returned over the Market.place, down the Petty-cury, to the Wrestler's Inn, where they were lost sight of, but from which spot they could readily get to the Newmaarket-road or elsewhere. In order to connect Miller, Smith, and Williams with this robbery it was shown that they and Johnson had all been together before and on the 12th of January, and lodged at a house in thb Newmarket-road, and that Johnson Miller, and Smith were at the Dog and Duck, which was the resort of militiamen, all three being in that force, up to about 11, when they left together; that the Dog and Duck was not two minutes' walk from St. Edward's-passage ; that about 12 o?clock Miller and Smith appeared at the lodging-house, and that Miller, going up to Williams, who was in bed bad a whispered conversation with him which ended in his saying that the other chap was out plaiing at cards and that they would go and bring him home; that they left the house but never returned, and were joined next day at St. Neots by Wilhlams, and that when they were there takea into custody Miller and Smith first uid they had just arrived froa Northampton, but afterwards retracted tht
statement, ,ying, "It is of MO se tellig any lies. The ether chap Is taken, and we were all at Bariw,"
Mr. Justice ERL1, having directed the jury to acquit Willams, left it to them toay whether Miller and Smith were implicated as well as Johnson.
The jury at once Conticjed Miller and Smith,il c- uttta Williams, whereupon
His T-OmnDSMP sentenced the thre gailty men to be transported for 20 yeag each, observingthat they had been found guilty of an offence which it was necessary to repress by the strong rm of the law.

The criminal calendar contains the h2ames of 125 prisoncrsa, -numerically speaking, a very heavy calendar. Among them are four charges of murder and a great number of cnmes of violence. The cases generally, however, are said to be of a light character.
In the Civil Court the cause list contains, up to the present time, an entry of 102 causes; 24 in the first, or Ianchester list, and 78 in the second, or West Derby lit. Among them are a very large proportion of special jury causes. Considering the interference of the elections with the business of the assizef, this is considered as a very good list by the lawyers.

MA ZoN-Mary Lynch was charged with having ctneDy deserted her male infant, seven mouths old.
John Gregory deposed that on Saturday afternoon he saw the prisoner " chuck" a child which she was carrying in her arms into the passge of the house No. 6, Crawford-place, Bryanston-squ re; and that he (witness) took care of tho baby, and caused information to be given of the occurrence at the John-street station-house.
Mr. BRtouGiroN.-Was the child crying?
Witneas.-Yes, Sir; but its cry was a very faint one, and I thought it was dying. I saw the prisoner in an hour or two afterwards coming towardsthe huuse, and she was then taken by a constable. When she perceived him near to her the endeavoured to effect her escape.
Clears, 99 D, preduced the child, to which his attention was called by the first witness, who was attending to it in the passage. It was then lying upon its back, its hands were as cold as ice, and he (witness) felt almost certain that the poor little thing was about to breathe its 1l The passage was very wet and dirty.
Mr. BRouGHTON.-What did you do with it ?
Witness.-I took it tothe workhouse. It was covered with vermin, and had evidently not had any care or attention paid to it for some time.
Mr. BRouuTmo.-What clothes had it on X
WVitneas-A cape, a frock, and two petticoats, all of them as filthy and ragged as could be. It had neither shoes nor stoclings.
Cockram, 175 D, stated that after the infant had been taken to the workhouse by his brother officer he captured the prisoner uponher being pointed out to him by Gregory, and conveyed her to the station. She alleged thatshe had been to a man who was the father of the child, but he refused to have anything to do with it.
Eliza Parker, assistant matron at the workhouse, statod that when the infant was brought to her its clothes were swarmmng with *ermin. She burnt tbe whole of them, and then gave the poor infnt a little beef tea, hut its stomach was too weak to retain it. It had been sadly neglected, and no doubt had been without nourishment for souie time before it was "chucked," as described, into the passage.
Mr. BROu1OTON (to Mr. Tubbs, the relieving-officer).- What do von know of the prisoner?
Mr. Tutbe.-She was admitted into the house on the 3d of Septemaber last, and the cbild was born there on the same day, and, at her own request, she was discharged on the 20th. n reply to questions which I put to her she told sne she was born inTipperary, had been in England only tbree years, and had done no act to gain a settlement. Since than I have several times offered to admit her with her infant, but ahe always refused to come in. On the 21st of lat month I gave her a written order for admission, bttt she persisted in her refusal. I have also, upon more than one occasion, given her tea, and sugar, and bread
The prisoner's answer to the charge was that the father would not support the chQld, and she had therefore ptla it into the passage where he was once livinJg, and she believed he was there still.
The Magistrate committed her to Newgate to take her trial, and the poor deserted infant was again conveyed to the ;orkhouse.
Wolfsip-sSE3.-JohnBrowning was chargedwith the following robbery
Mr. iThomas Wilkinson, wharfinger, of Portland-plaee, Lwer Clapton, stated,-My first introduction to the prisoner took place on the 1st of this month, when he called at my house with * request to ee me. I gave him an interview, and he stated that the only excuse he could offer for taking the liberty was thefact that he had been two days without food. I expressed my sympathy, and he went on to say that he was in great distress, and that he had tried everything he could to procure employment, but in vain, and accounted for that by saying that in the year 1846 he had been tried on an indictment for uttering a forged check, of w-hich he was entirely innocent, but that he had been found guilty and sentenced to 10 years' transportation, of which he underwent five years, and then obtained a ticket-of-leave for the remainder of the term, on which he sought and obtained several places of work, but that in each instance hb got them it was no sooner discovered he had been transported than he was discharged. I felt for his position and gave him a shilUng, for which he appeared very grateful, called on God tobleasme and was turning to go away when I caled him back anm told him that I was about to make a cbange ia my establishment shortly, and that if he would call upon me in a fortnight I would see what I could do for him, The next timeI sawhimwas onthe 14th of thismonth, when he again called at my house, and I then referred him to Mr. Dunk, my collector of rents, and told the prisoner to statehiscasetohim,witha*view*tohisbeingemployed. I, however, saw no more of him till yesterday afternoon at 6 o'clock, when my servant came to me in the parlour in great fright, and from what she told me I ran to the pantry, and there saw the prisoner with another of my servants. As I approached. them I heard the ring of sUver, and on entering the pantry I saw the prisoner's right band lifted up over some silver spoons and forks upon a shelf, as though he had just dropped them there. I exclaimed, "You are certainly a pretty sort of fellow, to come to me and ask me to give you rmoney and employment, and then come and rob me of my plate." The priso.jer replied, " I have not come here to steal; I came to look for you " but I sent for an officer and gave him into custody. The value of the plate was perhaps about 71.
Margaret Thomas.-I am housemaid in the service of the prosecutor, and, understanding from what my fellow-servant told me yesterday afternoon, while in the nursery, that the prisoner had asked to see my master and was waiting in the hall, I went downstairs in a few minutes, and there saw the prisoner creeping out of the pantry at the end of the hall on the same floor, and at the side of the kitchen stairs. I said, "Wbat are you doing there, Sir" and hereplied that he was looking for Mr. Wilkinson. I told him Mr. Wilknson was not there, and then the prisoner called out three times the name of my fellow-servant at the foot of the stairs. I ran to the larlourto teU my master, and then ran back to the pantry, inside wlhich I found the prisoner, and saw him take some of the silver forks out of his coatpocket and put them on one of the shelves, but he was in a great bustle, and the forks seemed to stick in his coat. I asked him what he had taken the plate for, and he denied that he had done so, but about anhour before that I had put four forks, four table spoonS, two dessert spoons, and four teaspoons into the plate-basket, and now all of them were on the shelf but one teaspoon, which I missed on counting them, and accused the prisoner of still having. He said, " I have not got your spoon," bat I could not find it, and told him ne must have it, on which he drew the spoon from his pocket and laid it on the shelf behind him, Eo that I might not see it, but I immediately threw it among the other plate and gave the whole to the constable.
Beck, 228 .-I was sent for last evening by the prose. Autor to take the prisoner, whom I found in the pantry. The ple produced was handed to me by the servant, and on taking the prisoner he said, "I came only to thank Mr. WDkison for hiS kindness, and to tell him I was at work in the dockcs."
Another officer in court.-The conviction of the prisoner can be proved, Sir, bnt the constable is not nowvin court who can do so.
Mr. BEYNCOVP.T (to the prisoner).-Do you wish to say an3thingin answer to this ?
Prisoner.-No; my defence would take too long a time now, and I shall therefore reserve it till the time of my tral.
He was oommitted for the completion of the depositions.
CLERKxnWLL-Timothy Ragan was charged by Henry Lynch, of No. 8, Baldwin-gardens, with stabbing him with intent to do him some grievous bodily harm.
It appeared that the parties had quarrelled on the previous evening, and on the following day the prisoner attacked the prosecutor with a fork and stabbed him in the thigh. He was fully committed for trial.

A second dog that had a muzzle on rashed towards her sister, and she becoming much alarmed, screamed out for assistance. The defendant, Mr. Sutton, who, in company -with a person who mnight be his wife or otherwise, was a little way off, on hearing her sister scream, turned round, laughed, and went on without calling away the dog. The consequence vas that the same dog mado a second attack on her, but she beat it away u we.l as she could with her umbrella, and ultimatelygot rid of the animaL Independent of the fright, the dog go iiijured and bemudded her dress that she could never wear it again, and the damage she estimated at 2Z.
Mr. ELioTT.-You say the defendant did nothing but lauh Can you say he set the dogs at you I
hrs. Jackson.-I cannot say he did; but I sUppose he must have done it from the dog running at mo a second time.
Mr. Solomon.-Mfr. Sutton and his wife passed you before the dog lumped towards you as yon have described ?
h an . ckeon.-Yes, he passed us with a horsewhip in his
Mr. Solomon.-Nowr, did you not go up to Mr. Sutton, strike him on the arm, and say, " You ought to be ashamed of yourself you are no gentleman ?
ms. Jaccson.-I did not strike him on the arm, but I mRight hAve asd he was no gentleman; and so would you if you had been attacked as I had been.
Mr. Solomon.-Did you not tell him he was a daneing master, and did you not say his wife, the lady who was with him, was some dnging mistress, or teacher, returning from giving lemons?s
m cRson.-I might have said so.
The testimony of the witness as to the dog attacking and jumping on her was corroborated by Mrs. Bennett, her
ister as well asby the driver and conductor of an omnbus, who iad witnessed it.
-Mr. Solomon contended that the complaint alleged had not been proved, and that the offence as shown did not come under the provisions of the statute. The dogs, as he *hould be enabled to prove, were the most quiet, doile playful, and well-behaved animals possible, and if, in their playful mode, they committed any offence, no one would regret it more than his client * but it was quite clear from her own admission that Mmrs Jackson herself had exhibited a want of temper in the matter, ana had been exceedingly inslting in her manner towards -Mr. and Mrs. Sutton. The learned gentleman here called a number of witnesses, who gave the dogs a most exoellent character.
lr. ELLroTr remarked that it was the duty of persons keeping such animals to prevent their being n agnoyae to the public or causwg an alarm and injury, as the dogs of the defendant had undoubtedly occasioned. It was also usual in cases of such annoyance and inWury, when complaint was made, for persons to apologize and offer every repaantion in their power, but in this case he was sorry to find a different conduct had boen pursued. The case, as proved, in his opinion, came clearly within the statute, and for the offence of allowing such dogs, or at least one of them, to go unmuzzled, the defendant must payapenaltyoE 20s., and also f°or the damse 20s. more, and the expenses, or be imprisoned

MINISTERS' MONEY.-An influential Roman Ca-
MrsmTRs' MONEY.-An influential Roman Catholic journal (he Cork, Reporter) has the following remarks uon the Government consent to the total abolition o thbe Mnisteres money-tax, an impostt condemned gnerally by all parties, some of its maost strenuous opponen being clergymen of the established church, It Is almost n2eedess for us to reiterato our conviction of the profound policy which moved the Government, at this time, to make such a concession. It cuts the ground away from the last objection which could be pressed aglinst Lord Palnssrgton's legislation for Ireland; and it must nov be adnit*ed that no statesman of modernatunes has condensed, within a brief space, Eo msay useful and liberal rneasares, for the advancement of thecinterests of this country, as hehas. Conservatives and Radicals *re equally tagreed upon this point and it is rserved for that most extrordinary body of politicians, calling themselves the Independent Opposition, to controvert it. They, with a ludicrous gravity, pride themselves upon the talent which they exhibit m striving to reconcile incompatibi. lities-theirs is an obstractive theory of progression; and their idea of activity is to hang like a plumb weight upon every effort at advaneement. To reason against the roceedings of such ment would be to waste argument on a line of conduct in which every successive act contradicts and nulliies that which proceded it. We should not throw time away in making any reference to the dul incapacity of such men, did they stand alone, but unfortunatelK, they, as representatives of Parliamentary constituencies -w 6se votes they have obtained upon some factious cry, bring contempt
and contumely upon our fellov-eountrymen, as if they indeed shared the opinions of such a lot of impracticable malcontents. We confess we cannot imagine what excuse they an. fm for havf delibertely voted against the Palmer. aton Government. Inwhoee favour did they mnake so egregiot ipa fter capacity formischlief?t Was it because the Premier attendled to our complaints and strenously applied himself to remedy t'he evils of which wo complained, tUht they banded with his enemies to overthrow him? lIhfact, such inconsistent and unaccountable policy on theirpart, as Irish representatives, ishould be sufficent Caus for ever to exclude them from the louse
and we entertainavery fixed belief that this country wouldavastly benefit by their expulsion from the Legislature."

THE NEW AMERICAN TARIFF.-President Pierce's
THE NXw AsBioaWq TAxrp.-President Pierce's Idt officialact was the signature of the new Tariff Bil4,which is DOW a law. As was to be expected, it bears marks upon its face of its compromise character, and of the haste ith which it was humed through Congress, but on the whole it is a very fair law, and WIl be acceptable to the people and the merchants. It may be described in one word as a regalar reduction of all the duties now paid. Those who do business with abroad are aware that importable commodities are zow classed under nine heads, which paid duty as follows respectively :-100 per cent., 40, 30, 25, 20, 15,10, 5, 0. These nowstandreepectively 80, 30, 24, 19, 15,12, 8, 4, and free. This estimate Is not striotly cor. reet, aome of the schedules having been enlaed,while others have been curtailed; but in the main it will give an idea of the work done. A great number of formerly dutffable articles, including wool worth less than 20c. per pound, fruits, spices, dins, chymicals, and dyestuffs, are transerred to the free afst The iron makers and wool msnufacttrers made so fair a fight that the reduction in the duty on most kinds of manufactured woollens and irons is only 6per cent., the tax being cut down from 30 to 24 per cent. Tias, of course, must only be regarded as the entering wedge. Now that the worko breakin down the manufacturiig monopolies has begun, It is not likely to be stopped until the tariff is fairly adjusted to a mere revenue stan ard, and the nation emancipated from the taxation of the manufacturers A year ortwo under the reduced duty will go far to convince the manufacturers themselves of the
gsdom of such a policy. One of the best changes that have been made is theremoval of 70 per cent. duty from brandies and pirits. The 100 per cent. duty was imposed onthe principle that spirituous liquors, being a luxury, ought to be
eavily taxed. The facts seem to show that the people regard them as a necessary of life-such a necessary, indeed, as no legal prohibition will suice to exclude froxm universal use. Sac, being the case, tbe effect of the duty has merely been to heighten the price of liquors, and the successive failures of the wine crops in France occurrin=
simultaneously, wholesome hquors have risen quite out of the reach of the poor. Vile poisons bave been sold in their place, with such results as the least notion of toxicology will suggest. The people of the United States have been poisoning themselves deliberately for four or five years. Good brandy is not to be had, almost at any prioce and the working men, who are used to drink it anu must have it, take vitriol and othser corrosives under its name. The new tariff will have the effect of cheapening brandy about one-half; so that there is a prospect that the moderate consumers may be supplied with a wholesome article at something between $3 and $4 a-gallon. It is estimated that the tariff will reduce the revenue about $20,000,000. This would answerthe purpose, especially asaaI goods warehoused between this date and the end of the fiscal year are to benefit by the tariff. But estimates of this kind are very liable to be wide of the mark. It woould not. be at all surprsing, considering the prosperity of the country, the systematic progress of agriculture in the West) the growth of our shipping and manufacturing interests, our means of internal communication, and the strong prospect that the convulion which the railroad schemes be. fore us have rendered certain will not take place within a year or two, if our merchants so largely increased their orders for the fall that next yeas receipts from duties were as heavy as those of 1856. Already we note at this portanIncrea6eof say 60to76Percent.* let this be maintained throughout the year, and by the time Congress meets weo shal need another reduction of the tariff-Kew

-The California Demorat comments on recent disclosures. about the prison discipline in California, and says :-" We have in our youth read tales of dark barbarities in the middle ages, and of the brutal treatment of prisoners in Russia, but we never dreamt of such things in free America; yet we must confes that tour constitution has become a. moclie7r that certain strata of society are wbolly destitute of any lueas of right, and that absolute barbarism is their nornmal condition. Those without means among the criminals who have been condemned to prison are horse'whipped and obliged to sleep on floors covered several inches deep with water; they have insufficient food, cover-* ing, and raiment; the keepers hold them in prison at wil lonig after the legal time of incarceration hasi expired, and practise upon them the obsolete system of torture. The doctor who vists them when sick has no sympathy for their sufferings; he does not inform the authorities of their condition, but divides with the keepers their gas, and thus the tomplaints of humanity aroeprevented. The same keepersrwho so maltreat ttepoverty-staice nprisoner who may be there for some slight mikdemeanour, give to the hardened criminal of means the widest possible privileces. They open. to him the doors of the prion at nighte andtris
a stream of criminals is poureduingt our city. Burglary, larceny, and muarder are the order of the day, and the prison ia the refuak of cr me. Who can prosmecte the criminals in prison?

The Royal Mail steamship Niagara has arrived 'vith the Boston mails of the lith and Halifax of the 13th.
She has brought $304,166 specie on freight.
In the Senate the Republicans grumbled at the formation of the committees, considering that they were not sufficiently represented.
The Democrats had monopolized five-sevenths of all the important committees. MIr. Crittenden had introduced resolutions in opposition to the new maritime code of the European Powers with reference to privateering, and in favour of the complete exemption of all vessels engaged in commerce and their cargoes from seizure in time of war. It was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.
The Standing Committee on Foreign Relations vas composed of Messrs. Mason, Douglas, Slidell, Palk, Orittenden, Seward, and Foot.
The Washington correspondent of the New York Courier and P,7suirer states that the British treaty had been referred to the Committee on Public Affairs, and that the determination appeared to be to act upon it. The President is said to have expressed a wish that the Senate would act immediately on the matter.
The correspondent of the New York- Times is of Dpinion that this negotiation of the treaty is impossible in its present form.
Much sensation of an unpleasant nature had been created by the decision of the Supreme Oourt in the "Dred Scott" case. It was to the effect that the plaintiff, Dred, being of African blood, was not a citizen of the United States, and therefore was not competent to sue in a court of the United States. The seven Democratic judges pronounced for the slavery of Dred, the two Whig judges for his freedom.
The Secretary of the Navy has ordered the United States' steam-frigates Niagara and Mississippi to. be equipped for sea with all possible despatch, as these vessels have been selected to assist in laying down the Atlantic telegraph cable between Newfoundland and Ireland, in compliance with the A ct just passed by Congress.

Her Majesty's ship Euryalus was at Havannah on on the 2d inst.
In the New York market on the 9th inst. the reduced rates of foreign exchange and the accumula, tion of specie in the country had created a better tone. First-class bills on London could be had a fraction under 8 per cent.
In the stock-market there were some indications of improvynent. Foreign exchange was quiet, some bankers having reduced their rates. We quote bankers' signatures, 60 days' sight on London, 108 -to 108 ; Paris, 5 22W to 5 22±.
In the cotton-markfet for the past week there had been a good demand, the market closing firmly at an advance of ic. per lb.
Flour was dull and heavy, wilh a tendency downwards. Wheat was quiet, with ssaU sales. Corn moderately active, and prices buoyant. New mess gpork was buoyant. Beef was active, at full prices. Spirits of turpentine were lower. For common rosin there was an improved tone.

LIVERPOOL, aLUt:cn 23.
The Liverpool and Philadelphia Company's screw steamship City of Washington, Wylie, commander, arrived this morning from New York. She left that port early on the morning of the 10tb, but only brings advices to the 9th inst., and had 30 passengers.
On the 10th inst,, off Sandy Hook, the City of Washington passed the Cunard screw steamship Emeu, hence. On the 11th, at 6 a.m., passed a screw steamship, supposed to be the Kangaroo, hence for New York; and at noon on the same day the United States' mail steamer Hermann, from Southampton for New York. On the 22d inst., off Tuskar, the Royal Mail steamship Asia, hence for New York, was passed.
The Belgian screw steamship Leopold I., from Antwerp and Southampton, arrived at New York {on the 7th inst.
The political advices are very meagre. Mr. Buchanan called his Cabinet together early on the morning of the 7th, and the sitting was a protracted one. They were to meet every day until all the mrgent business before them was disposed of.
Reciprocating the courteous reception which Mr. Dallas, the United States' Minister at the Court of St. James's, received at the hands of the merchants of this port, the New York Chamber of Commerce resolved to extend a welcome to our Ambassador, Lord Napier; and with this view a deputation -waited upon his Lordship at the Olarendon Hotel. At his request the ceremony was entirely private. Among the merchants present were Messrs. M. H. Grinnell, James G. King, ThomasTilletson, Henry A. Colt, Deming Duer, Adam Norrie, James Da Peyster Ogden, E. E. Morgan, Henry Grinnell, John A. Stevens, Alexander Duncan, and P. Perit. The deputation was introduced by Mr. Joseph Y'owler, Her Majesty's acting Vice-Consul; their reception was cordial, and the impression produced on both sides an agreeable one. Mr. Perit, the President of the Chamber of Commerce, addressed his lordship as follows .-
" In behalf of the Chamber of Commerce of New York, we have called to pay our respects to you, and to offer to you, your lady, and family, a cordial welcome to the shores of our country; in doing which we but give utterance to the sentiments of the wholeo commanity. Your arrnival in this country is the more interesting, as it will fully restore the diplomatic relations of Great Britain and the United States of America, and will we trust be the means of adding strength to the ties of consanguinity, friendship, and interest which bind these nations together. On this continued harmony of feeling and action depend not only the prosperity of two great and powerful nations, bat the advancement ofoommerce, civilization, and liberal institutions throughout tbe world. It will be the distinguished privilegeof your mnission, we trust, to contribute largely to theseogreatobjects. We regt that your early departure for Washisgton will prevent tbe oppcortunity of tendering the attentions which it would have afforded us and onr fellow-citissna great pleasure to render, and thatwca
onfy oner you mi this interviews heatt welcome." "
Lord Napier replied,-
"'Mr. President and Gentlemen,-l beg you wil convey to the New York Chamber of Commerce mo y highost senFe of the honour they have done me in offering me their congratulations on the occasion of my arrival in this country. I can assure you that no efforts shall be wanting on my part to realize the happy anticipations which you have had the goodness to express, and to deserve the favourable opinion which you have gratuitously formed of my ability to promote the interests of our respective countries. I come with every desire to bo usefuL Although I have never visited America before I have enjoyed the intimacy and friendship of many of your countrymen abroad, and I would gladly merit that regard on the part of the nation which has been extended to me by its individual members. The sentiments of cordiality which you have conveyed to me are those which sanimate the Government and people of Great Britain. If I fail in giVing effect to them it may arise from a deficiency of ability, but never fromn a want of good will. I am, moreover, justfied in anticipating that nothing can occur to smar the harmony of, our international relations or to diminish those friendly sentiments which, under no circamgts4ces, have ever expired in the hearts of the two nations. I -veatureto hope that the period of my employfient in the UIted States may be passed in that concord aitd cooperation whini2 are so essential to our mutual welfare and to the best interesus of mankind."
After a brief greeting the deputation retired.

(FROM A CORRzSPONm"r A
OFF BASRtA, JA?. 3L I General Sir James Outram, with his personal and part of his general staff, left Bombay on the night of the 16th, on board the steam-frigate Semiramis, and touched at Kurrachee on the 19th, where he remained a few hours to communicate with Colonel Jacob (who has lately been appointed BrigadierGeneral) respecting the speedy transport of 800 of the Scinde Horse to the seat of war, and on other important matters connected with our future operations, in which the renowned Colonel is destined, we *hope, to play a conspicuous part. Knowing the value of such craft for river navigation and transport, and, moreover, the small number of them at our disposal, Sir James directed the Nitocris flat to be taken in tow by the Semiramis, but, having met with a strong northwester at the entrance of the Gulf, and fearing that the drag might greatly impede his progress, he ordered her to be left at Bassadore, where the Semiramis anchored at 9 a.m. of the 25th inst. Sir James lost no time in landing and inspecting this station, and it was well that he did so, for the most absurd arrangements had been ordered for its defence. Two 68-pounders had been landed, and the crew of the Ajdahar steam-frigate had already oeen there nearly a month, engaged in putting them into a position, which would have made them an easy prey to the enemy, should they have mustered up courage to cross over the narrow channel which divides the Island of Kishru from the mainland. After examining the ground the General pointed out where the defences should be placed, and directed the schooner Constance, which had been guarding an unimportant part of the passage higher up the channel, to anchor before Bassadore in such a way as to co-operate with the land guns, should any hostileattempt be madeagainst the place. By thisjudiciousarrarngementthe Ajdaha steam frigate will be available for active service, instead of lying useless in the Bassadore roadstead.
The Semiramis steamed away from the last mentioned place at 2 p.m. and in two hours came up with the Pioneer, ouId for Bassadore and Bombay. An opportunity was thus afforded Sir James of sending despatches to the Presidency. Late in the evening, but when too dark to allow of any communication with her, we passed the French frigate Sybille, lbound for the Persian Gulf; and, favoured by
light breezes, the Semiraims came to anchor in Bushire roads at 1 p.m. of the 27th. Shortly after the small steamer Lady Falkland was seen to set off from the shore with General Stalker the Political Resident, and several officers of the Staff; but Sir James, instead of waiting for their arrival, rowed off with Commodore Ethersey, and met them halfway. The meeting on the part of the two Generals was most cordial, and it is to be hoped that the same unanimity will continue to exist between them during the campaign.
Sir James, after visiting the Residency, rode out to the camp, situate about two miles from the town, dined at the Staff mess, and s^pent the night in General Stalker's tent. The next morning he held a conference with General Stalker and the Political Resident, when it was determined that the latter, accompanied by the Commodore, Captain Young, of the Semiramis, and one or two of Sir James's staff, should proceed forthwith to Mohammereh,'in ordertoreconnoitrethe place, andtoobtain as much information as possible respecting the new fortifications said to be in course of erection there, the number of the garrison, the best means of attacking it by land and water, &c. Another object of this expedition is said to be for the purpose of ascertaining how far the Arab tribes of that district, and along the banks of the Karoon River up to Shuster, would be disposed to befriend us, or, at least, whether they would join the Persians in opposing us, or remain neutral in the contest. There can be little doubt but that these prelimina, ries point to some active operations in that quarter, and, if everything progresses favourably, we should not be surprised to hear that on the arrival of the first detachments of the Second Division from Bombay they were despatched forthwith to Mobammereh, to take possession of that place before the Persians have had time to intrench themselves more strongly. In that case, it is presumed that Sir James would so fortify the iatrenched camp before Bushire as to be able to detach about 2,000 men to join the expedition against Mohammereh. No delay whatever would occur by this arrangement in any plans that may be devised against Shiraz, inasmuch as, from want of baggage animals (which are not likely to be forthcomng in sufficient numbers for three or four months at least), no attempt can be made in that direction beyond, perhaps, obtaining a more salubrious encampment for the troops should they be obliged to remain here during the hot season. It is much to be regretted, indeed, that so little had been done in the way of procuring animals before Sir James's arrival. An order for some thousand camels and mules was sent to Basra only a fortnight ago. The Land Transport Corps, however, is being organized, and two officers attachedto it have proceeded in the HughLindsayto superintend thecollection of the animals. Another officer has proceeded by the same vessel to superintend the affairs of the Commissariat Department in that quarter.
The Hugh Lindsay steamed by Mohammeroh on the morning of the 31st of January, and the officers on board had a good opportunity of reconnoitering the new fortifications which have been erected there. These consist of two new mud forts on the right bank of the Haffar, but an angle of one has already been washed away. Crowds of armed soldiers rushed to this point, and one or two g,uns were speedily set in motion to oppose any hostile demonstration. There were great numbers of mules, horses, and other baggage cattle in the palm trees around, but the Persians abstained from the least sign or token of offence. As far as one may judge, Mohammereh, which will form an important basis for future operations on the Karoon, will speedily yieid to a smaU British force; and, if the Arab tribes of the district between Mohammereh and Shuster prove friendly, our troops wiU be in possession of the latter place before the hot weather commences.
Mr. Murray is at Bushire, and is said to be waiting for a favourable opportunity of returning to Bagdad, there to await the issue of the present struggle. The meeting between Sir James and the Ambassador was most cordial; nevertheless, we feel persuaded that the gallant General will be guided in all things connected with the present difficulty with Persia by the dictates of his own enlarged judgment, which has hitherto led himn onward to success in the many important affairs which have been intrusted to his management.
Important Decision On Slavery.-The most
L OTAIET DECISIO - ON ZSLAVERY.-The mo3t important decision ever made by the Supreme Conrt of the United States was pronounced yesterday, and a summary of its leading points will be found among our telegraphie despatches. That supreme tribunal of the land decides that the ordinance of 1787, so far at it prohibited slavery from the north-v est territory, was unconstitutional; that the Missouri Compromise, so far as it excluded slavery from the Louisiana territory north of 30° 30', was unconstitutional; that Congress had no power to prohibit slavery from any portion of the federal territory, nor to authorize the inhabitants thereof to do so; that negroes are not citizens of the UJnited States; and that the residence of a slave in a free State does not affect his legal condition upon his return to a State where slavery is allowed by law. Thus, at one blow, all the legislation of the country, from the formation of the constitution to the present day, against the extension of slavery, is swept away; and the Supreme Court decides that the constitution e: proprio vigore carries slavery into every portion of the federal territory, or what amounts to the same thing, authorizes the slaveholder to carry it thither, in spite of Congress or the will of its inhabitants. The power of Congress over the subject, and the modern doctrine of popuar sovereiguty in the territories, are alike repadiated and annulled. It is not in the power either of the federal Government or of the federal territories to exclude slaverv therefrom. Itis impossible to exaggerate the importance of this decision. It gives the sanction of constitutional law to the practical revolution which for some years past has been going on in the policy of the Government upon this subject,.and engrafts upon the theory of the repubHe the doctrimes upon which Mr. Calhoun laboured in vain, during the last years of his life, to rally even the people of the Southern States. Bet one more decision is seeded to make slavery the actual law of the whole repubhc, and render its prohibition in any of the States null and void; and this we shaU probably have when the Lemmon case reaches the game tribunal which has just reversed the whole policy of the Government in regard to the territones. lo popular revolutaon wi1 follow this decision, startling as it will be to the opinions and principles of threefourths of the peoplo of ths United States. It will he accepted as the authoritative exposition of the constitution, and regarded by all departments of the Government and by the people as the law of the land. No issue will probably ever he made upon it before the people, for the practical settlement of the question wiU anticipatoany political result that might be reached; but it will, profoundly affect the plblic mind in regard to 'the general question of zlavery, and will change the issues which must, ievitably come up sooneror later in reference to it. that. it will render them less absorbing in their nature, less distbrbing in their progress, or more safe and peaceful in t1iwi results, no one who k;nows anything of the te'nper of the Amcecaeppple On 1r a monment believe,-.ive Ywr4, Amu.

PUBIC MEETINGS.
FIMSBTJRY.
The nomination has been appointed to take place on rziday next and the polling on Saturday.
A crowded maeeting of tho electors wws held last evening at the London Mechanics' Institute, Southainpton.buildings, Chancery-lane, to hear an address from. Mr. T. S. Duncombe.
Mr. H. CLARKE preided, and, before calling on Mr. Duncombe to address the meeting, expressed gratification at the vote which that gentleman gave in favour of the Government in reference to the Chinese hubbub, because it was necessary to the protection of our interests that our representatives at distant foreign sations should have the power in emergencies of resorting to violent measures without waiting for the consent of the authorities at home. Mr. Dancombe was worthy of the confidence of the electors, because he was never absent when the rights and liberties of the people were in question in the House of Commons, and had never held or sought plIce.
Mr. HNnDS asked whether it was true, as had been reported in the CcrkenAesscU New, that Mr. Dancombe did not intend to coalesce with any other candidate, but had expressed a hope that Mr. Cox might be his colleague ?
Mr. Duxcomsmu-I never said anything of the sort. (Cheers.)
In reply to further questions from electors
Mr. DuNcomnBs said that he would vote for an equalization of poor-rates and land-tax, and then proceeded to addreas the meeting at some length. Poltical parties, he sad, were atpresent in an extraordinary state. Old colleagues were pulling each other to pieces, and most of them using language familiar to the old ladies at Billingsgate (Laughter.) The people had better not interfere with those quarrels, asthere was some prospect thatthe result would be to their gain. He was independent of every Minister, and was therefore, and only therefore, able to do his duty to his constituents. He had never asked for place for himself or his friends or relatives. Parliament had been dissolved because the Tories were again scrambling for office on a pretence of barbarities committed against the Chinese, and the peace-at-any-price people detested Lord Palmerston's policy, which was this-that our national honour should be maintained at any price. Those who voted with that party cared little about the "Celestial" blood of China. What they wanted was the terrestrial office of Lord Palmerston. (Laughter.) Whenallthepa ars.totheChinese affair should have been laid before Parliament (and some had arrived in England even since the division on Mr. Cobden's resolation) the conduct of Sir. J. Bowring might be placed in a very different light, even in the opinion of the Peace party. Those who called themselves Liberals said that Lord Palmerston was nothing but an old Tory, and that he was too obstinate and pig-headed to do anything like reforming our laws orrepresentative system, while, on the other hand, the Tories, by the mouths of the Earls of Derby and Ellenborough, denounced him as a dangerous man, the latter noble earl having said that Lord Palmerston had nothing like a fixed rigidity of opinion. (Laughter.) Even ..our old friend Graham" and Lord J. Russell had attacked Lord Pa&nerston's political character, they being of opinion that he was too great a Tory to do anything in the direction of reform. Now, Lord Palinerston availed himself of the opporthnity afforded by the banqu6t at the Mansion-house on Friday last to defend himself against these attacks, and he (Mr. Duncombe) believed that the noble lord spoke the truth -when he said that he was willing to be an instrument of the national wilL If, then, the people of this country should find in the next Parliament that Lord Palmerston did not satisfy them of his own accord on questions of reform all that they had to do was to show him that they demanded his moving forward in the path of reform, and the noble lord would at once obey the national command. Lord J. Russell had been recently bidding for the Premiership, but had he not been tried and found wanting as a Reformer? What measures of reform had he passed during his Premiership t Sir James Graham had claimed to himself and LordJ. RussellS credit for being true and veteran Reformers to the disparagement of Lord Palinerston; but it certainly was rather extraordinary that the worthy baronet never experienced any qualms about becoming a colleague of Lord Palmerston whenever a chance was offered to him, while he now joined in the cry against him. MIr. Duncombe having alluded to the zeal with which he had attended to the interests of Finsbury, and to the park for the northern portion of London (for which650,0001. would be given from the consolidated fund), requested his friends to go early to the poll on Saturday next.
On the motion of Mr. HoPwOoD, seconded by Mr. SoUTHEY, a resolution was passed amid acclamation, pledging the meeting to return Mr. Duncombe free of expense.
hr. Serjeant Parry, Major Reed, and Mr. Cox, the other candidates, addressed the constituency yesterday in various parts of the borough.
SOtITHWARK.
Last night a number of the electors of Southwark assembled at the Literary Institution in the Borough-road, on the invitation of Mr. J. Locke, to hear from that gentleman an exposition of his political principles and of the circumnstances which. in his opinion, should induce them to elect him one of their representatives in Parliament. The meeting was crowded to excess.
Dr. UCLULCE, who occupied the chair, opened the proceedings by observing that the dissolution which had recently taken place had thrown the country into some confusion, and h to no smaU extent effected a dislocation among the Liberal party. If he had thought, however, that Mr. Locke's claims to their support were based simply upon a cry of " Palmerston" he should have had nothing to do with introducing him to the meeting. (Cheers.) But he knew that gentleman to be a Radical reformer, a thorough friend to the working classes, and he believed that there was not the slightest comparison between him and either of the other candidates. (Cheers and some hisses.) That slight symptom of disapprobation would soon be changed to a most triumphant cheer, for he could assure that gentleman who hissed that Mr. Locke wouldbe returned to Parliament at the head of the poll (Cheers.)
Mr. LociE then presented himself, and he was received with those bursts of applause usual on such occasions. He said that it was indee gratifyig to him again to meet with so cordial a reception from those whose interests he was desirous of forwarding. When he first came into the borough for the purpose of placing himself before them to carry out those great principles which for many years he knew that they had adopted he certainly had some little hesitation, because he felt that a constituency like that might expect that some individual should present himself who had been already a tried man in the House of Commons. No such person had offered himself for their consideration, and to no man-let him be the highest in the land-would he yield in a sincere desire to carry out those principles -which in his address he had endeavoured to enunciate to them-princi-
les which he had not adopted for the occasion, but which ne had advocated throughout the whole of his political life. (Cheersm) He believed that there was very little difference of opinion with respect to the recent vote come to by the H0ouse of Commons. They were all desirous of upholding the dignity, power, and honour of the British nation. They were all agreed that that flag which had " braved a thousand years the battle and the breeze" should not be diuhonoured either on the coast of China or in any other part ef the world (cheers) ; and therefore he was persuaded that they would agree with him that Lord Palinerston, so far as he had upheld the honour of the Enghsh name, was entitled to their support. (Cheers.) But passing to domestic institutions, which came more nearly home to them, he should frankly state his opinions upon them, and if they coincided with those of the electors it would be gratifying to him to secure the confidence of so important a body as the electors of Southwark. He had long considered the position in which the working men of this country were placed; he had long marked the progress which they had made in intelligence, and he found that a vast number of those men were at present deprived of the elective franchise who were clearly entitled to possess it. (Cheers.) Wherever power had been conferred on the peoo
e it had been used in a manner which had rendered the hrone and constitution much firmer than before, and, so viewing the question, he thought that the workiug classes were entitled to a still further extension of the suffrage. He shouli be therefore a firm and strenuous supporter of such extension when they returned him to Parliament. (Cheers.)
might say that, almost from his infancy, he had been structed in Liberal principles. He remembered the days of the Test and Corporation Acts and of those annoyances which debarred from certain offices persons of particular creeds. All that had been swept away, but one little relic of the barbarian still remained in the shape of church-rates. Church-rates he would at once and for everabolish ; and he would also, without delay, emancipate the Jew and every man of whatever relgious persuasion, because he adopted the broad principle that no man had a right to inquire into the creed of his fellow-man. (Loud cheers) The miserable prejudice sl3ainst the Jewvs which Parliament stil indulged mhwasahbLctupoor statutebook, and in this asin other respects he hdalways been a firm and consistent reformer. (Choers.) He wasnotafreetrader of yesterday, but had advocated those principles when they were not so fashionable as at present. As to legislating for the working classes, his opinion was that the maore Parliament let the working classes alone the better. (Cheers.) They wanted no legislation to mak th pei~e ethe vituus r vcius. Afford schools fortheedcaton f he eope;giv tem the opportuni-
all the sympathy and all the commiseration vhich either sex could bestow were immediataly lavished upon him. (Cheers.) Hlow much better would it be to begin at the nrght end and relieve the industrious, honest, struggling poor by their sympathy and their money, but, above all, by educating their children. (Loud cheers.) He wanted none of that philanthropy-if philanthropy they chose to call it -which only looked to the criminal, and had no regard for the working man. He looked upon this great social question as the question of the day, because, compared with the rights, interests, and privileges of the masses, all other questions sank into utter insignificance. (Continued cheer2ng.) On the subject of Sunday amusements, he contended thatthe National Gallery and the British Museum stood on
recisely the same footing as Kew Gardens and Hampton
ourt. Theywre natiohal institutions paid forand upheddby the people; and it was for the people to express by their voioes whether they would have them opened or not. Cheers.
Beyond this, he advocatud vote by balot, the abolition o) the lawof ecttlement, the equalization of the poor.rates, and those other objects enumerated in bis advertised address.
On the motion of Mr. GUNTOy, seconded by Mfr. BAsInRss,
and supported by Mr. DsxaGE, a vtot of confidence in Mr. Locke was unanimously agreed to, and the proceedings

LAMBETH.
Thle writ was proclaimed at Kenuingten.cross yesterday, and the nomination has been fixed for Saturday, the spolling
for Monday.
A& mseting of M S, Roupell's supp took pl 1 JA
ivening at the Surey fusic-hall, which was erowded to exCess. It ws computd that- upwards of 10,000 persoas were present.
-Mr. F. Dou=oi presided, and in introducing Mr. Ronpell to the notice ofthe meeting stated that he supported that gentleman because he wras a thoroughly indeqendent candidate, because no man was more interested in
eborough than he was, because there were few men in Lambeth who had done more direct good in the borough during the pest 10 year, and also because he held principIes wthich the experience of past elections proved always comnmnended themselves to thle mas of the electors. (Luud
Mtr. Rourrr, observed that the assembly he was addressing wss one unprecedented in the annals of this borougb, and probably comld hardly be paraUeled throughout the country. Referring to his political opinions, he declared that they were of no artificial growth, and had not been adopted to serve a particular object, to be. cast aside when that object was attained. One reason for his coming forward as a candidate was to be found in the fact that the two late members had almost systematically voted against each other, so that there appeared to be a clear o ening for a third and an independent candidate. It woued be his especial object to promote such measures as would make the House of Commons what it was not, but what it ought to be-the People's House. (Cheers.) With the simple fact before them that only one-seventh of the adult male population of this country was at present represented, no 3oter argument was necessary to show that a large measure of Parliamentary reform was loudly called for. Mr. Roupell proceeded to enarge upon various points touched uoon in is address, declaring in favour of any measure tendiz to advance the interests of the working classes, to lessen their hours of toil and lengthen their hours of intelligent recreation, to abolish the truck system, and to nrotect children in factories from the demoralizing effects of excessive labour. He denied that he was an ultra-Palmerstonian. While he was prepared to give honour where honour was due, and while he admired the firmness and the vigour which Lord Palmerston had displayed in times of great difaiculty and danger, he should not go to the House of Commons merely as a supporter of the present Premier, who, as he could not forget, left the Mistry in 1853 because a liberal measure of reform was proposed, voted against the abolition of church-rates, and had recently divided against 3Mr. Locke King's motion. (Cheers.)
In reply to a luestion afterwards put to him, Mr. Rour=s said that ad be been in Parliament he should have voted with the Ministry on the China question. (loud cheers.)
Several other aquestions having been satisfactorily answered,
mr. BoicEmoved, and Mr. GRADY seconded, the following resolution:-
"That tbe poUtcal principles of Mr. Roupell, as explained by that getleman this evening, are such s fully entitle him to the confidence and support or the electors of the boro7gh of Lambeth, snd this meetingpledges Itelf to exert Its utmost Inuence to retaun him to the Commons House of Parliament."
The resolution was carried with only two dissentients, and, after a vote of thanks to the chairman, the vast meeting dispersed.
Tho ex-members, Mr. Wilkdnson and fr. Williams, also aedressed meetings of the electors yesterday evening in other parts of the borough.
BURY.
Mr. R. N. Philips addressed a very crowded public meeting in the Theatre on Friday evening. Mr. T. Wrigley presided.
Mr. PHmLrs said he regarded the bombardment of Canton as an extreme measure, and M1r. Cobden's course as a perfectly honest one, but he believed the motion had been turned to factious purposes. He considered Lord Palmer. ston'sfores-c was foreign pohey, and he caUed upon the electors to return a representative with definite principles, and pledged to household suffrage and vote by baUot. He should like to see a general system of education -which would not in the least interfere with the religious feelings or social interests of any body. He did not think we should be in a hurry to take off the income-tax if we could only do it by increasing the duty on tea and sugar. He vas in favour of the grant to Maynooth, and thought the Sunday question a matter for private judgment. He had not asked, and should notass; anybody for his vote, but, if returned, would be thoroughly independent.
A motion pledging the meeting to support Mr. Phillips was carried unanimously.
On Saturday evening Mr. F. Peel addressed a meeting of non-electors, and met with considerable applause ; but there was no vote of confidence, and the vote of thanks to the chairman (Mr. R. Ashton) was ruet by about as many hands against as for it. The proceedings terminated in some confusion.
STOCRPORT.
A great meeting was held on Friday evening in the Temperance-hall, to hear addresses from the sitting members for the borough. Mr. Alderman Williamson presided.
Mr. KERSHAW, who spoke at considerable length, ex plainedhisreasonsfornotvotingatalon Mr. Cobden's motion in reference to the China question. On carefully perusing the papersrelating to that subject, he felt that he could not consc3entiously support the Government in the course that had, been pursued, while, on the other hand, he felt that by voting for Mr. Cobden's moffon he might be aiding to over-
trow Lord Palmerston's Government to mwake room for a Tory Admmnistration.
Mr. J. B. S3sTe explained the grounds on which he voted for Mr. Cobden's motion. He considered tbat he was not sent to Parliament to voto with the Mlinistry under all cicumstances. The Government whipper-in once complained that he bad not voted with the Ministry on a certain occasion. He replied, " I always vote with you when you are right." "Thank you for nothing," was the rejoinder "we most need votes when we are in tne wrong." He wished to know whether Lord Palmerston would give the ballot, extension of the suffrage; shortening of the duration of Parliaments, and reduction of taxation. He considered that Lord Palmerston could not ask for support until he had answered that question satisfactorily.
Votes of confidence in Messrs. Kershaw and Smith were passed unanimously.

TEs FOREIGN- KISsONS OF THE UNITED STATES.- If there is one topic more than another in regard to which we are authorized to indulge the deepest anxiety, it is the course of the new Administration touching the foreign lega. tions. It is a topic upon which as yet we bave no light. Will the entire body of our representatives abroad tender their resignationsvoluntarily or upon secret suggestion? Or, if refusing to display that Christian and self-denying temper they persistently hold over, will they be removed, and other an dbtter material substituted? The questions are of the first importance. Al the issues of peace or war upon which the prosperity of the country is primarily dependent for the next four years will be mainly decided by the kind and character of the diplomatic corps, of whom General Casw is to be the chief; there being no room to doubt that if the present incumbents be retained, or men of the same in-
fferent qualty substituted, our foreign relations will be a source of endless muddle, trouble, and disaster. The system requires reformation, radical and thorough; it requires elevation,-tbe selection of a far higher order of men to fill the leading missions. The weakest point of that weakest of Administrations which expired this week was this of its diplomatic appointments. Nothing but the steady and shrewd Conservatism of Secretary Marcy has preserved the Government from mischief. Borland was sent to Central America at the very time that Webster and Everett warned the President that our relations in that quarter required the most delicate treatment, and the choice of a better man than was likely to be sent to London or Paris. He was removed after the perpetration of unjustifiable violence and i}lconduct, to give place to Wheeler, who became the active agent of Walker, alienated every Government of the Isthmus, driving them into closer alliance with England, and who, although his flagrant misbehaviour was rebuked and repudiated by our Government, has never been recalled. Soul6 so deported himself at Madrid as to disgust the old Castilian Prejudices and offend the Court it was OUr interest y every practicable means to conciliate, and urged the objects of his mission with such blunderig incpacty as to excite the laughter of the European diplomatic crcles. He gave place to Augustus Ca sar Dodge, a frontier lawyer unable to speak a word of anything but western English without any akill in diplomacy, and wholly incompetent to cope in the simplest controversy with the astute Spaniard The rench mission has been obstinately clutched by a confimed invalid, incapacitated by severe and protracted iUness for a worthy representative of this Government at the leading European Court, and who has lacked noral and physical strength to resign even when apprised that delicacy alone prevented his removal. Mr. Dallas, although a very fair and respectfully-behaved gentleman, not unendowed with sound common sense, is, it seems, to be repudiated; at least, the rejection of his treaty will, it is naturally presumed, lead to his immediate resignation. Our Minister at the Hague rivals the famo of the Count do Mormy as the greatest speculator of Europe. Our Ministers at Naples, erne, Berlin, and St. Petersburg are, it is supposed, dead, smce, with a solitary exception in the case of
I Fay, nothing has been heard from them since they drew their outfit from theTreasury. Allwe hear of theresident atLima is inthe tone of complaint. Our representative at Mexico has just advertised his Government as a licensed pawnbroker; our representative in China permits the inception of a war without interposing to prevent it by the effcacy of remonstrance and a formal demand for reparation. With such agencies abroad it is nowoader that the American name suffers, and its influence in world-politics flags, the clerks of a provincial custom-homs, draugbted at random, I and deapatched to the several missions, could not fulfil their
functions less creditably. When we proceed, therefore, to sum up the net results of negotiation during the last four years, we need not besurprised to find that we have lost prestige, withoutgaining in return any solid commercial or political advantage. Treaties and alliances have lost nnsettled,-none constructed or confirmed. The balance is seriously against us. The session of the Senate will be a protracted one, furnishing an opportunity for a clean sweep and wise re-occupation of the legations. The President, by availing himself of the senatorial sanction, mayavoid the disagreeable personal responsibility a batch of uncohflrmed appointments awaitinganother Congress must-subject him to. Let us hope the opportunity will not be wasted. As we hope to gain that first position in universal polities which we believe to be our inheritance, let iss remodel our foreign representation. The objection of insufficient py wvhich has nitherto withheld men of first-rate capacity from this branch of the pu'ldic service, bass been removed by the late diplomatic and c unsular ac. 210g reer is open to

Considerable curiosity was excite last might br teo appearance of Sir Wiliiain Don, a young baronet, who has gained great celebrity by acting in the English provinces, anud also in jivers cities of Germany, where he has performed in the Ge man language.
The first entrance of the facetious baronet, attired as a country bumpkin, was in itself a signal for laughter. His height cannot be under seven feet, and, as his limbs are proportionately xtout, he looked among the rest of the personages like a rustic GuUiver among LiUiputians. The piece (played for the first tinmel had evidently been wrtten to sut the pbysical peculiarities of the artist. A proud Countess behaves very tyraunicany to the huge peasant, whom she regards as little better than a brute; but, when she is placed in a podition of danger she is gLad to avail herself of the giant's protection. The exults. tion of Gies Oaltapple in his own strength is represented by Sir William with much humour and in a manner perfectly unattainiable by an artist of inferior size; but it is not in the Belle and the Boor (as tho piece is called) that his comic talent is displayed to its full extent. A drama entitled the Toodlcs, boldly fashioned from a work of xerious interest by lopping down the pathetic scenes to the smallest possible dimensions, so as to leave all-prominent the comic character, originally intended as a relief to the rest, affords an opportunity for one of the most eccentric delineations of cbaracter ever witnessed. Mr. ToodIes, repreaented by Sir William Don. seems to be a village oddity, who utters impertinences to everybody whom chance throws in his way, and treats his wife with unvarying brutality. However, Mr. Toodles soberis a smallindividual compared with Mr.Toodles in a Ftate of inebriety. To iUustrate this poetical condition Sir William. crowds together all the absurdities, not thAt a dranken man could commit, but that the wildest imagination could associate with drunkenness. He sticks his pen in the front of his neckcloth, and then fights with it becauze it interferes with his vision. He clambers over a railing and back again, and then is astonished to fSnd that he is still on the wrong side. He makes several 'ain attempts to utter a sbort sentence, and finally conquers the difficulty by bawling out the last syllables with the whole force of his lungs. Whether such a form of intoxication was ever found in actual life is extremely questionable; but imitation of nature is evidently not intended. An exuberance of invention has been bestowed to produce a grotesque image, which the actor has borrowed from no predecessor, but conjured up from his own imaAgination, a nd decorated with every variety of ludicrous and exaggerated detaiL. The exhibition is not to be analyzed, but to be laughed at, and in keeping his audienoe in a roar Sir William Don succeeded to perfection,

Preservation Of Life From Shipwreck.-The
k'RESERVATIox or LIES FRON SHrpwnzK-The annudl general meeting of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution was held at the London Tavemn on Thursday last, Rear-Admiral the Duke of Northumberland, K.G., President of the Society, in the chair. The meeting was numerously and influentially attended. The noble chairmxn ojpened the proceedings by expressing his gratification at the great success which had attended the important operations of the institution during the past year; and, after dwelling in appropriate remarks on the facts disclosed in the report, called on the secretary (Mr. Lewis) to read tbe same. It commenced by referring to the progress which the institution was making in its career of usefulness and in public estimation. The committee were thankful to be able to report a continued immunity from accident to the lifeboats of the institution, and that their crews had, as hitherto, the utmost confidence in their safety and efficiency. During the past year new lifeboats had been built by the institutton for Drogheda ana Dundrum Bay, in Ireland; and for Dungeness~, Padstow, Bideford, WaLlmer, and Hornssc, on the lioglish coasts; whilst others are in course of construction for Arklow, Caxore, Kilmore, Youghal, and Ballycotton, in Ireland; for Camber, in Sussex; for Beaton Carew, in Durham ; and tor Penmon, inl the Island of Anglesea. Boats were also ready to be furnished to Westport and to Wicklow, in Lreland. Lifeboat carriages and boat-houses bad also been built for all of the stations which requred them, the total number of lifeboats belonging to the society being now 58. The lifeboats belonging to and in connexion with the institution had, since the last report, saved the crews, consisting of 126 persons, of dxteen wrecks, and had proceeded to the assistance of many other vessels in reply to signals of distress. From the Board of Trade return of the wrecks that occurred on the coasts of the united k-ingdom during the pest year it appeared that the totalnumber of wrecks in that period was 1,153. The loss of lives from shipwreck in the same period was 52L It was, however, gratifying to find that the numnber of lives saved from ship. wreck had been unprecedentedly large, 2,243 shipwrecked perwns having been rescued by lifeboats, shore-boats, and other means. The total number of persons saved from shipwreck since the first establishment of this institution by its lifeboats and other means, for rescuing whom the committee have granted honorary and pecuniary rewards, was 10,101, including 473 rescued last year. During the pat year the institution had awarded 21 silver nsedfals and 18 honorary testimonials inscribed on velum. It has also voted 4621. in pecuniary rewards to persons who bhd saved, or endeavoured to save, lives from wrecks, Since the establishment of the institution in 1824, 79 gold medalions and 577 slver medals for distinguished services had been voted by it for saving life, besides pecuniary rewards, amounting together to 10,1211. From the fiancial statement of the income and expenditure of the institution for the past year it appeared that 2,6371. had been exp>ended in the building, repairing, fitting, aud exercising lifeboas;3,031 onlieba t carriages ; 6901. on lifeboat-houses; 4901. on rewards and medals for saving life from shipwreck, these being the principal and legitimate objects of the institution. The liabilities of twhe instiu tion for lifeboats, carriages, and boat-houses were still 27601. The Board of Trade c-ontinued to render valuable pecuniary assistance to the society. The report drew attention to three gifts of a special character during the past year to the institution. The first was that of 1601. 17s., the cost of a first-class lifeboat, contributed by some members ofthe Royal Thames Yacht Club. This lifeboat had been stationed at Walmer, near Deal She had already rescued, during a dark tempestuous night, on the 5th of January lAst, 15 persons, from the bark Reliance, of London. The second was that of 150&, being the value of a lifeboat, from a previous liberal contributor to the institution-Mrs. Ain Wood, of EBtham. The third was that of 1801., being the cost of a first-class lifeboat, her gear, and hfe-belts for her crew, from Mr. William M'KerreU, of Bill-house. On any lives being rescued from shipwreck by either of these lifeboats, these generous donors will always have the peculiar satisfaction of feelisg that the same had been the result of their individual gift to the institution. The committee, in conclusion, felt assured that an institution which, in addition to having granted rewards for rescuing 473 persons from shipwrecks during the past year, whose lifeboats had in the same period been the means, under God, of snatching 126 of their felowcreatures from a watery grave, had only to mako its claims extensively known to be fuUy appreciated and liberaUy responded to by the affluent and humane throughout the land. It was moved by Admiral Earl Talbot, Eeconded by Mr. Montagu Gore, and unanimously resolved, "That the report be adopted and circulated." v arious resolutions pledgimg the meeting to renewed exertions on behalf of the truly benevolent and national objects of the institution were afterwards moved and seconded by Admiral Sir T. Cochraue, Mr. William Cotton, Captain Washington, XRN.,
Ir. J. D. Powles, Mr. Themas Baring, M.P., Mr. Thomas Chapman, F.RS., Captain Halstead, N., and Captain Raven. The usual complimentary thanks having-been given to the noble chairman. and briefly acknowledged, the proceedings, which were of an unusually interestingcharacter, closed.
Doxc-ASgn Nuw PAiRIsH Cscunu-A month or two ago it was found necessary, before proceeding with the tower of the new church at Doncaster, now in couras of erection under the superintendence of Mr. G. G. Scott, architect, of London, to appeal to the inhabitants of Doncaster and its neighbourhood and the public generally for an addiffonal subscription of 10,0001, the funds obtained by the first subscription, amounting to about 30,0001., being exhausted. The town-council of Doneaster headed the supplementary list with a contribution of 4,0001., and since then the names of many noblemen and gentlemen residinz in vartous pars of the country, together with those of several ecclesiastical dignitaries, have been added to tho list, and the amount subscribed has nowv reached the sum of 8,600L Althoughthis is 3,4001 short of the money required for the completion of the church, it has been deemed sufliciontl large by the building committee to warrant them in continuing the works of the church, which would otherwise have anort %been suspended, and orders have now been given for that purpose. The masonry of the whole of tho church as far as tho bue of the tower is com. pleted, and it is with this latter portion that the worlmen willhenceforward be engaged. Arrangements havo been made with Messrs. Warner of London for a new peal of bells, which will be cast under tho direction of Mr. E. B. Denison, Q.C., the above-named firm having talken the old bell metal discovered after the fire at Doncaster Church, and offered to allow interest -upon it until the time of the now peal being required. Mr. Dent, clockinaker of the Strand, has promised Mr. Denison to la a clock ratis for the tower of the new church. Mr .W.Yrrn,n Pippbrook-hous, SurTey, hasrebuilt tho south chapel in a very rich st le entirely at his own expense. M. Caproniare, of Brussels, has lust completed two %taIned gUiaswindows, representing scenes from the Old Testatnent, to occupy the two aisle windows at the--west-end of the church, thee fenestral ornaments being -the gift of Mrs, Saunders, of
