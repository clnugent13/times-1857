The Frauds On The City Banks.
THBE FBAUDS ON TEE CITy BAN".
JYohn Anderson and James Townsend Saward, who have been several times remanded upon the charge of having conmnitted a series of extensive forgeries and frauds upoj% various bankers In tho city, were again brought before the LonD MAyor at tho Mansion-house for further examinat tion.
Mr. Muliens, solicitor to tho Committeo of Bankers for Protection from Porgories and Frauds, atteaded as heretofore on the part of the proseiution. Ur. Gifardappared; for Saward; Anderson was not defended.
Mfr. S. Draper was sworn, and, in answer to Mfr. ifullens, said,-I alm a print and drawing mounter, and live at No. 8, St. Pancras-square, Old St. Pancras-road. In the bogining of 1856 I advertised for a situation, and. received an ansver, in consequence of which I went to 32, Leman. street, 13oodman's-fields, and asked for a person named Davis. I jwas taken to a person who answered to that name. Anderson resembles that person, but I cannot sweat to him. Some conversation took place between uJ, and I called the foUowing day, when I saw the same person, and he sent me to Moore's auction-room, near Mile-ead-gate, for a cataloguo relating to a sale. He afterwards sent me to Messr Barclay and Co., the bankers, with a check, which I was to get cashed. The check now shown me for 46 1.s. 6d. looks like the one I got cash for. He told me to get two 101.-notes, 261. 10s. in gold, and os. 6d. in silver. I delivered the money to him at the house ir Lemian-street. I caUed there, according to his request, on the folowing Monday, and found that he had gone away.
-Mr, Andrew Stephens, cashier te Messrs. Bramah and Co., locksmiths and engineers, in Piccadilly, said-Ma employers keep an account with Xessrs. Ransom and C; tha bankers. The three checks produced for the restective sums of 711. lOs., 471. 12s., and 87C. 14s., have been eharged by Messrs. Ransom and Co. to Messrs. Brarnah's account. They purport to be signed by Mr. Gilbertson, who was in the habit of signing checks for the firm, but the signatures are not those of thatgentleman. The checks have not been aken out of the book that we had in use in March, 1856.
MIr. T. C. Thorne.-I am a cashier at Messrs. Ransom and Co.'s bank. I paid two of the three checks produced, one for 47T 12s., the other for 871. 14s. The third check is marked as having been paid.
G. H. Bowel.-I am a photographer, and reside at 6, Wellngton-terrace, Paddington-green. In Mtarch, 1856, I advertised for a situation, and received a letter, in conso-
uence of which I proceeded to 16, Stanhope-street, ,ent's Park. I there saw a man who went by the name of Bates. He sent me to Camden-town railway station to make an inquiry, and he afterwards gavo me ^a check for 871. 14s. upon Messrs. Ransom's bank. (The witness iden. tified the check) I got money for the check, and gave it to him at the house in Stanhope-street. I subsequently made a communication to Messrs. Bansom.
Miss Mary Ann Parker.-I live at 16, Stanhope-street, Begent's Park. In March, 1856, a gentleman called at my
house and hired apartments of me in the name of Bates. He remained in the horse about half an hour. I recollect the last witness coming to the house while Mr.Bates was ere Te prsonerAndeson i theman vrh paszed as John Wigzell, a porter, living at 11, Vere-street, Oxfordstreet, said,-In April last I advertised for a situation, and received an answer, in consequence of which I went to a house in Cumberland-street, Hackney-road, of which a Mrs. Barnes was the landlady. I there saw a gentleman whom Anderson very much resembles. He sent me to ar auctioneer's to get a bill of sale. He afterwards sent me to Messrs. Hankeys'banktogetcashfor abill for286L 17s. i0d (The witness Identified the bill, which purposted to be drawn by Messrs. Jennings aud Co., upon Messrs. Samuel Dobree and Son, of Tokenhouse-yard.) I did not get the cash, and was detained at the bank. I returned with somebody to Cumberland-street immediately afterwards, and could not find the person who gave me the bilL
Ms. Bames.-a liv at 1% Cumberland-street, Hackney, road. In April last a gentleman who gave me the name of White hired my apartments. I could not swear that the prisoner Anderson is that man, but he is something likq hnim. I recollect the last witness coming to see that man.
Mr. Gray.-I am a clerk in the house of Messrs. Dobree and Sons, who have an accourt at Messrs. Hankeys. I am. in the habit of accepting biUls on their behalf. The acceptance to the bill produced for 3861. 17s. 10d., purporting to be signed by me, is not my writing, but is a very good imitation of it.
Mrs. Mary BoxalL-I live in the house of Mr. Tnrner, who keeps the Crovn and Anchor Inn in Guildford-street
Southwark. Iwas residing there last summer, and was I3 the habit of seeing customers who visited the house. I know both prisoners. I also know the convicts Hardwicke and AtwelL I have seen all four together at the Crown and Anchor on two occasions to the best of my belief.
Mr. lullens.-Do you recollect a circumstance occurring the first time they came
Witness.-Yes; they wanted some refreshment, and having none to sat before them we sent out for some boilea beef. On the morning following one of their visits Hardwicke called and asked if he had left his pockethandkerchief at the house ? I searched and could not find it.
Cross-examined by Mr. Giffard.-I have been wg this court on a previous occasion, but not while Hardwickeand AtweU were under examination. I was brought into court for the purpose of seeing whether I identified the prisoners. I have been sittingin court all day tiU I was calledinto the box. I cannot say where the beef was sent for.
Mr. Giffard.-You did not know that Hardwicke and Atwellcalled the Crown and Anchor the "beef" house, did you '
Witness.-I did not. (LAughter.) It is anuuncommon thing in our establishmaent to send out for beef. Chops and steaks are more the *' go" in our neighbourhood. (Increased laugter.) A lad called James, who is not here, fetched
Mrs. Sasannah Davis, ladlady of the Sussex Arms in the Eaglefield-road, said,- -I recollect last summer four persons coming to my house between 9 and 10 o'clock in the mornmg. ley had some brandy and milk, and asked for pen, ink, and pper, and I supplied them with these things I cannot identify either the prisoners or ardawicke and Atwell as the persons who visited my house on the occasion in question.
Mrs. Elizabeth Cole.-I live at 3, Beacham-villas, De Beauvoir-town, near the Sussex Arms. In the summer of last year a gentleman hired my parlour in theoname of Riley. I recolcet the witness Clements, who was examined here, calling to see Riley, who was at my horse three days. The prisoner Anderson resembles Riley, but he 'has now differently ecloured hair.
Mrs. Anne SewelL-I live at 23, Addlington-street, Yorkroad, Lambeth. In June last the wit *ess Clements lodged at my house, and Hardwicke calh I and asked for him,
Mr. W. P. Nicholls,-I am cashier to Messrs Hevo
and Co., the bankers'; Messrs. Kinnaird and Co., of Austinfriars,}keep an account with us. On the 14th of June last the bi)l produced for 1,0001' was presented to me for pament by thc wFitnems Clements.
P r. Murteis.-When you were in the act of paying the bill did anything happen ?
Witness.-I had canceled the bill and had handed 100a. in old, but not the notes, to Clements, when I was induoed to ook at the signature again, and discovered it to be a

I have seen two persons who were pointed out to me as Hardwicke and Atwell. I recollect upon one occasion, about the middle of June, four persons dning at the King's Arnms, one of whom was Hardwicke. They had rump-steaIs for luncheon, as they termed it. I do not identify either Saward or Anderson as being one of the party, but I have seen Sawvard about London.
Mr. Mullens.-Where have you seen Saward ? Was it at the King's Arms ?
Witness.-No I have not seen him there that I know of. I have seen him as a man about town. (Laughter.)
Saward (with much warmth).-What made you take so much notice of me as to enabie you to say that you have known me as a man about town?
The witness made no reply to this question, and Saward was proceeding to follow his question up when he was pievailed upon by his solicitor to desist.
Examination continued.-I sawvHardwicke this morning in an adjoining room and told himr what he had for dinner on the occasion of wbich I have spoken, and he admitted that I was correct ?
Mr. Giffard.-You say that Hardwicke admitted that yoe were correct.
Witness.-Yes; I recollect it well. There was not a sufficient quantity of steak, and Mr. Felton, the landlord, took down a loin of mutton and cut some chops off it. Mr. Felton ought to have been here to give his version of the matter, because I was only a visitor at his house.
Re-examined by Mr. Maullens. -Iwas this morning shown into a2 room -where I saw Atwell and IHardwicke; imme, diatelyrecognized Hardwicke, and he knew me well. Michael Haydon was then sworn

Money-Market and City Intelligence.
MO.NBY-MA BT and CITYINTELLIGBNO2 .
Wednesday Evening.
There has been a total absence of fluctuation in the English funds to-day, and the tone of the market has been generally firm. Consols were quoted 93j to J for money, and 93n to ; for the 5th of February. The amount of busmess was limited, but the public continue to effect purchases. Bank Stock closed at 216 to 217 ; Reduced, 93j to 944; New Three per Cents., 94* to ;; India Stock, 219 to 221; Exchequer-bonds, 98i to 99*; and Indiabonds and Exchequer-bills, 2s. discount to 2s. premium.
In the Stock Exchange to-day there was an increase in the demand for money, and the rate for loans on Government securities was 56 to 6. Out of doors there was no alteration.
Foreign securities have been steady and prices towards the close in some cases exhibited an improvement. Turkish Six per Cents. were negotiated at 95, and the Four per Cents., guaranteed, at 103g. Operations took place in Venezuela for the account at 364, and in the Deferred at 15i. The general business comprised,-Brazilian Fourand-a-Half per Cents., 97i; Buenos Ayres, 84 .
Guatemala,60; Portuguese Three per Cents., 43k, Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 96X, 96, and 97; the Small, 96: Spanish Three per Centa, 40i
and Dutch Two-and-a.Half per Cents., 64s, ;, and' % ,,
4he com-market this morning was without alteration.
The inal quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 67f. 70c. for money, and 67f. 95c. for the end of the month, showing a renewed fall of a quarter per cent. The submarine telegraphic communication is now completely re-establishecL
The bullion taken from the Bank to-day for exportation has been only about 4,0001.
At a half-yearly meeting of the London and Westminster Bank held to-day, Mr. Aldermau D. Salomons presiding, a dividend at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum and a bonuis of 6 percent. upon the paid-up capital, free of income-tax, were declared, mak-ing, with the previous payment, a total distribution of 17 per cent. for the year, and the report was unanimously carried. The Chairman stated that business continues to produce highly satisfactory results, and that the total of deposits has increased from 9,000,000?. to 11,500,000?. The balance of expenditure for improvements in premises is being steadily reduced, and with regard to the city establishmnent the amount outstanding is only about 1,5001. Although the directors have again granted a gratuity to the clerks of 10 per cent. on the amount of their salaries it is stated that it must not be considered a settled regulation, since circumstances may arise to prevent its continuance, or induce the board to make future appropriations the foundation of a superaunuation fund. The dividend has been declared from bon4 fide profits, ample allowance baving been made for contingencies, m- eluding bad debts and losses. With regard to the reserve fund, which is now 150,0001., the directors consider that the decision arrived at in 1854, by which it was decided that it should not exceed that amount, may with propriety be reviewed. The deposits, kc., which were then 7,000,0001., have since experienced anaugmentation of 4,6500, 000. With so great an amount of responsibility, the directors appeal to the proprietors to allow tbe interest of the reserve fund to be added to the total, together with any indivisible surplus of profit at the end of each year, until 250,0001. be attained, unless otherwise determined by a resolution of a general meeting. Although the majority concurred in the sug gestion, it was deemed advisable to give special notice to the shareholders, and hence the discussion was postponed. In answer to questions, the Chairman mentioned that the amount of loss incurred by the bank through the failure of Mr. De Jonge, Mr. Barclay, and others, who have been mixed up in doublful bill transactions, is 2,0001., and that, although something may be recovered from the respective estates, the whole has been written off. At the conclusion specialvotes of thanks were passed to the directors and managers. Subjoined is an abstract of the report:-
"The directors have to report that, after making provision for aU bad and doubtful debts, paying the income. tax, setting apart the sum of 2,0001. towards the new build. ingsin Lothbury, Bloomlsbury, Temple-bar, and Southwark, and presenting a gratuity of 10 per cent. on their salaries to al the officers of the establishment, the net profits of the bank for the last half-year amount to 84,755h, which added to 8,5101., the unappropriated profits of the preceding half. Year, make a total of 93,2651. Out of this amount the directors have added to the rest or surplus fund the sun of 2,2871., making the total amounst of that fund 150,0001. ; and they now declare a dividend to the shareholders at the rate of 6 per cent, per aLnUm, and also a bonus of 6 per cent. upon the paid-np capital. Alter these payments are made
here i5 an unappropriated balance of 9781., which remains to the credit of the profit and loss account.

Merry," invalidating the security of dock warrants, was consequent upon the facts of the case having been wrongly presented to them, and that but For this circumstance the judgment of the Exchequer Court, which was in accordance with the feeling of the entire mercantile community, instead of being reversed, would have been confirmed. A stronger proof of the necessity of the steps about to be taken by the merchants and bankers of London under the resolutions adopted at their meeting the day before yesterday could not have been given. Messrs. Merry stated thesse
in a plain nercantile manner, ana the result in tlle frst instance was that the plaintiffs were nonsuited. The legal minds at work upon it then contrive to give it some other cololuing, and a contrary decision is pronounced, by which Messrs. Merry are sufferers to the extent of 2,0001. It is then admitted that the second judgment was erroneous, or at least that it was a judgment obtained by the circmnstances of the case having been put in an improper manner. The only remaing remedy would be a ruinous appeal to the House of Lords, to the sole
profitof theprofessional gentlenenwhoseproceeding, CJVbaused all the confusion. Thus, as the law atpre-
Ee' stands, the holders of hypothecatedwarra28s are not only exposed to the risk of any differences of opinion that may prevail in the oourts as to its actual construction, but to that of a perversion of the facts in any given case, owing to all their essential points being kuried among the pedantries of the system of pleading. Nothing short, therefore, of an act of parliament which shall remove these Eecurities from the poesibiity of question, other than such as would apply alike to banknotes and bills-namely, whether they are genuine, and have been taken at value and with due caution%-will maeet the evils of the case and enable the trade of the kingdom to be carried on with confidence.
A resolution was adopted in the Court of Bank.
ruptcy a few days back calculated to shut out from the public many of the most important facts which would otherwise have been likely to transpire in connexion with the history of the Royal British Bank. The shareholders who refuse to pay calls are now being examined, and the grounds of refusal, especially on the part of those who were induced to subscribe for the second issue of shares, constitute matter of great interest, since, besides the light they might throw on the inutility of all legislative provisions for securing good management in commercial or financial undertakings, by showing that in this case the promptings of natural prudence were often overcome by the representations made as to the security afforded by the protective clauses of the charter, they would enable an opinion to be formed of the individual culpability of such of the directors and officers as were most active in entrapping victims. After the first day of these examinations, howvever, when the interest that attached to them wvas fully perceived, the Court acceded to an application that they should in future be conducted inprivate. The plea for this privilege was, that the details were such as might injuriously influence the pecuniary position of the persons exammed, but the obvious preventive in that respect would have been, as suggested by the Commnissioner, to withhold the publication of names in all instances where they were not essential. As the manner in which the state of the 4xaw and the open scramble for the assets in the various courts are rendering the condition of the sufferers one of utter instead of partial ruin would also have been usefully illustrated, and as this is a point in which all who may at any period occupy the position of claimants upon a chartered company are interested, an additional reason exists for doubting the propriety of the suppression which has been permitted.
The notorious evils of the state of the bankruptcy laws in England appear to be moderate compared with those experienced in Scotland. The follovin'a communication describes the progress made in the administration of the estate of Messrs. Dickson and Co., of Glasgow, a large speculative house which failcd three years ago for S98,0001.*
"Sir,-Oe the 6th of March, 1854,;Dickson and Co. of Glasgow, Australa merchants, failed for a very large amount.
"messrs. M'Bwan and Auld, by profession, I believe, o- countant, were appointed by the creditors on the spot 'trustees, something similar to our official assignee in England; except that the one declares a dividend when he has cash in hand, and the other does not. These trustees have received above 15,0001. belonging to this estate- how long they havo had this money, or how long it willb before a portion will be divided among the creditors, we are left in
apy ignorance, as, although Imake apersonal application eaca four months that I visit Glasgow at these gentleien's office, I always receive the same reply,-viz., 'Cannot declare a dividend until some law pleas are settled.'
I "Now, Sir, I appeal to you whether such a case ought to be permitted in a large commercial city ? Although nearly three years have elapsed no statement of the bankrupt's affairs has ever been transmitted to the creditors. There is no doubt sufficient to pay a dividend of Is. Sd. in the pound, and, expecting a circular informing me where to apply for this dividend, I receive one requesting me to agree to hand back the estate to the bankrupt on his paying the creditors Is. Sd. in the pound. Surely this is not justice in Sstland. " Yours most obediently,

THE SMITHFIELD MEETINGS.-The chairman of
'ifHI SMITHFIELD MEMTIGS.-The chairman of the meeting held last Monday in Smithfield says-
" They must now let it e known that they onew they had a right to live and a rlght to share in the wath which the saw acumnulated around them. The Peor Lai said that every man had a right to live, and, actini upon thi, principle, he id that the people had a right to an eusa division of property ;mtil their wants were satisfied. They would appeal to the great of the united kingdom, and compel them to give of the ahundanoe which they thbe workers) saw aroun theni to relieve the nocerstuous.c Now this, in plain English, we take to imply nothing les
than a determination to carry out the very worst principles of the very worst form of communism; unot erely to insist that the institution of private property ought not to exist, but to act in defiance of its existence. It is precisely the argument which might be advanced by the burglar or the footpad ; and, thongh Mr. Pierce proposes to carry his princel es into effect only by legal and peaceable mean it is self-evident that the adolption of them by any large portion of the working classes in this country mus result in the most deplorable mischief. We have, however, little fear of such a misfortune. Tho principles of honesty and justice ce strongly rooted in the English character, sad a theory of this,whch outrages them all, wil never fId favour among any considerable body of our countrymen. It cannot be denied that the condition of the unemployed operatives who, to the number of 35,000 in London alone, according to their own account, ae co egated in our large towns, is very much tobelamented. a rheirs isa hard caseu ; but iis not to be amended by any of the empirical measres they
ave andgested. It cannot be permanent rlieved, either bv affording them work on the waste n of the country, which under such circumstances could hardly be made to repay the cos of cultivation, or hy increased and liberaiHzed workhouse accommodation, or any similar pro. cess. The only possible remedy is to investigato the source of the evil and to remove it if pobsible. It is plain enough that if there are 35,000 unemployed workmen In oundon. this must be becau there are that number more than are wantedl at the present time to supply the labour market ; that number, inr fact, more than the capital at co'mmand can profitably employ. Now, to force capitalists -either private men or the nation at large--to employ these men unprofitably is to compel the withdrawal of capital from those occupations in which it increawse ani which, therefore, add every year to the funds used foir the eupport of labour ; its investment in such a manner as wiu
prevent its increase, and thereby oblige a continually increasing number of labourers to depend upon a wages fund stationary in amount. A scheme more ruinous to the country, a-nd more fatal to the interests of the working futues in sticu, could hardly be devisd. Upon the theialofthnation they depend to supply them with the
ueans of work, with materials, tools, and the wages which suplport them until the fruit of their work is reaped. Everythgwhich tendsto increasecapitalis,therefore,d direetgain
to them; and every act that tends to retard such increase is an act of hostility againist themn. Now, to employ a portion of the pital existing at lrent rw i un e th m
ployed, and ongagig them in o wh ryield no Profit, is to prevent the increase of capital, and therefore to inju
ihb working clatsss by mithdrawing from them the means of future subsistence, which they would otherwise derive from the addition to the wages fund of the profits of that capital which it is proposed to expendaunprofitably. The insane hostility to capital and c-apitalists evinced by certaiin aoiciLsant friendls of the working clasis is one of the mnost

The arrivals of wheat and other grainhavo been moderate this week. "The wheat trado (says Binney and Co'. Circular) haa been extremely dull during the wee, and prices hove a downward tendency. The country markets are well suppliedwith home-grown wheat, and miilers appear quite indeDendent of foreign, and the stockrs here In ganary rather accumulate than otherwise. The presentm unseaonable weather bas a depressing effect on the trade, and, in the probabiliby of the Baltic and other ports belng about to reopen, there Is more disposition to get out of old stoc of wheat; and, although holderswonldmake some concession, business to any extent is almost impracticable, the quantity of one sorb or other offered for sale at the present moment being considerably raore tbAu the con4umpUve demand can take off."

RAILWAY INBELLIGENCE.
R()VAT. WVITiTclT
A genoral meeting of English shareholders in this comn ,any was held yesterdayat the London Tavern, MrW W. J. ghapli, ILP., in the c air.
The secretary read the report, an abstract of which has *ppeared in 27^c Tims.
The CdILRBIAN said, he hoped the report was safficiently ample to preclude the necessity of his occupying their time beyond making a, few remarks. It was natural that concessionaires, projectors and original directors should desire to set forth their undertakings to the best advantage; ani that shareholders should to a certain extent dissent therefrom. But in the present case they must not consider either him-elf or coleagues in any such character. They were neither promoters nor original directors, but had, like other shareholders, become involved in the affairs of the company, and their only object was to overcome the difficulties with which they were surrounded. By the force of circumstances he (the Chairman) became possessed of 1,500 shares and 600 obligations as originaUy gssued, and, with a view to improve the condition of the company, he had felt it his duty to sabscribe for 2,100 preference shares,oeing share for share of what he had previously held. His colleagues, mainly actuated by the same principle, subscribed accordingly, and what they had done in the management of the company's affairs he trusted would secure the confidence of the shareholders. It was as well to remark that his friend and colleague gr. Tottie, being actuated by high and bonourable feelings considered himself, in consequence of his peculiir connexion with the Swedish Government, called upon to resign his seat at the board, as it had become evident that the purchase of the undertaking would be preferred in Sweden to any other mode of aid or interference, thereby enabling the Government to adapt the railway so as to form part of the enlarged system of railways now ia contemplation. He had been asked why was not the treaty carried out while he and Mr. 'fartndge were at Stockholm? The shareholders had been informed that the deputation had had an interview with the King, than which nothing could have been more encouraging; but Sweden having a liberal mode of government the power rested mainly with the Parliament or Diet, which had not then assembled; but it had sine met, and the King had proceeded with their ease, which was now under discussion. He (the Chairman) had explained these matters with a view that they should clearly comprehend the composition of the board, to enable the proprietors to judge how far they could extend their confidence; for if they could not justify that view it would be far better for his friends and colleagues at once to retiro. (Cries of "TNo, no !") They would not at present succeed by discussing terms, and, perhaps, differing on matters ef detail, or the manner in which they should divide the proceeds among them when obtained. The only way to succeed would be to enable the board to complete the first half of the railway, if needful, by adopting the report and strengthening their hands by voting the several resolutions which would be submitted. They might feel assared that the best endeavours of the directors would be made for the preservation of the interests of the company, with this understanding, that nothing should be finally deCded upon with regard to the disposal of the property until their assent were obtained at a general meeting convened for that purpose. (Hear, hear.) The directors had subscribed for between 4,000 and 5,000 of the new shares, and their interests were identical with those of the shareholders generally. They had had some communication from Sweden whichwasnot official, to the effect that the Government were disposed to purchase the railway by the arbitration of two persons on the part of the company and two persons appointed by the Government; but, as such a modewould cause great delayand expense, the board preferred a more prompt mode of settlement. Since the report was in the hands of the printer a telegraphic communication was received from Sweden, and that morning another was received. It appeared that Mr. Waern, the chairman of the company in Sweden, had gone to the Diet to explain matters ; the Government director, Admiral Von Steyern, had resigned; and the petitions which the English board had drawn up and presented to the King were refused. The proposition was to work the line themselves under a new concession or to sell the undertaking on fair terms. The Diet eeemed inclined to refuse the proposed loan to the company towards carrying out the undertakng, but appeared desirous of purchasing the line. The g had left the matter to Colonel Erieson if they agreed to sell it at a valuation. The proposed terms for selling the undertaking were considered too high, or rather not low enough, and it was understood the colonel would proceed to make hisvaluation of the undertaking next spring.
AIr. MoCAWrrA complained that the promise made to the 7 per eent. shareholders was not adhered to. He understood from tho advertisements that if a sufficient number of shares were not taken up to pay the debts and complete 45 miles of railway, the money would be returned to the subscribers. He thought the holders of obligations should be content to take less than the fuU amount, as they were issued at a discount. He contended that ithe Govornment had not shown them any hberality, and it appeared they
wished to obtain the railway for the lowest possible sum. He did not agree to the mode of settlement shadowed forth in the report. The 7 per cent, shareholders had paid their money to save the concern, and he thought the obligation holders should not take precedence of them. He fearedthe holders of orginal shares would get nothing whatever. He maintained that the Government of Sweden ought to allow them 4 per cent. on their outlay, and that a canl should not be made before the end of three months.
Mr. Svtamoux, a director, said, they had enormous difflculties to contend with, but they thought they could do something for the old shareholders. He did hope that arrangements would be come to and matters would be amicably settled. They did not expect that the Swedish Government would pay for the frauds of Mr. Sadieir, and if they bought the undertaking it was fair they shouli give a premium, as formerly agreed upon. (Hear, hear.) He thought Mr. Mocatta had no right to complain. If the calls on the shares which had been takben up were paid they could pay all the debts and finish the 45 miles of railway. Every farthing was appropriated to the purpose intended, and they ha
pledged their credit for the company. They had no other motive but to carry out the wishes of tho shareholders. They could not expect the people of Sweden to pay for Mr. 5adleir's frauds, bat he was sre they would not take an unfair advantage of them. They had been told that the preference shares would rank after the obligations, and it was probable they would have something for aU the shareholders. They were told they would be caUed together before the next call was made, and they were now assembled for the purpose of deciding the question.
The CR31Ax, in reply to a question, stated that there were about 25 miles of the railway open for traffic, and five or six miles more ready to open; another short distance would come into operation in July next, and the whole 45 miles would be completed in August If tho funds wore forthcoming, which he expected would be the case. The receipts on the portion of the line now open amounted to 81. per mile per week; but they had no means of conveying the minerals, in consequence of not having sufficient ioco. motive power on the spot, which would soon bo remedied. He hoped they would complete the 45 miles of line, and disose of therailwray. HXe was ashamed to say that parties
formerly paid money for shares for which credit had not been given in the books of the coinbany, the money having been retained for other purposes. Their accountant had investigated several of tose claims sad had found them correct.
A shareholder endeavoured to show that the Swedish Government had not kept faith with the company. Ho had paid his money on the faith of a guarantee, but it seemed when the money was paid there was no guarantee.
Mr. D.WADDLNGTO?N, MP., hoped they would place confidence in the directors, and expressed an opinion that the Swedish Government would not take advantage of their position, but would act towards them in a fair and honourable manner.
The CihAIR-MAS said it was very natural for shareholders to complain, but the fact was the line should have been completed in 1855, and it was now 1857. The cantion money might have been forfeited, but they still continued to receive interest upon it. They would be happy to complete the railway or sell it to the Government becore completion. The fact was the company had not performed its part of the agreement with the Government.
Mr. SEmiOUR explained that the materials for the railway were admitted duty free; and that the King had promised to do all he could for the company.
The report was then adopted, and the directors wore authorized to make another caU on the preference shares at the end of two months.
Resolutions were unanimously passed confirming the issue of the 7 per cent. preference shares to 40,000 shares, exclusive of those taken by creditors; authorizing the directors in England to enter into arrangements for aid to complete the railway, or for the sale of the undertakin h the Swedish Government on the best terms that could be made, but no definite contract for the sale to be concluded without the sanction of the shareholders ; also forming resolutions authorizing the directors to issue shares to those who had paid for them, and in some cases to exchange shares for scrip; also to issue obligations to those who had paid for the same, and to perform other acts which were necessary to perform in justice to those who had paid their money to tho company.
A ecordialvote of thanks to the chairman and directors concluded the proceedings.
MANCHESTER, SHEFFIELD, AND LINCOLN.
SHIRE.
The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday at Manchester, Mr. Chapman, deputy-chairman, preslding.
An abstract of the half-yearly report and accounts has appeared in The Times.
The CHIRMArN, in moving the adoption of the report, premised that the consideration of that portion of it referring to the new railway to Oldham had better be kept distinct, and held over for consideration until the special business was entered upon. He congratulated the proprietors on the increase of net profit, from 17560847. in the Tear ending the 30th of June, 1853, to 286,85516 in the year
Just ended-an increase of 111,7711. The gross receipts on the half-year had, perhaps, not been so large s some of the shareholders expected, but, the net profits having, nevertheles, been much greater, the result must be considered satisfactory; and, considering the increasing guarantee of weekly receipts from the London and North-Wrestern, under agreement, he believed, if the increase of net profits for the next 3iyears kept pace with that of the last 31 years there would at the end of that time be a dividena of something like 3A per cent. for the
original shareholders. (Hear.) That desirible point might be attained sooner or later than the time he suggested according to the future course, favourable or the reverse, of affairs in the commercial world. He beheved there was every reasonable prospect of prosperity, and, although the Ilrgest shareholder in the concern, he bad made his holding greater, and not less. (Hear, hear.) It was gratifying to remarkl that the paesenger receipts, for some years stationary or retrogading, were now again on the advance, and also to observe the geat increase in the coal traffio over the line. Although e direct recelpts for conveyance of this coal -wre not great having to be shared with the Great Northern and South Yorkshire Comanies, it 'was most advantageous to attract ships to Grinsby by the facility of their taking out full return cargoes of coal and salt in place of ballast. (H!ear, hear.) Tho largely incresming trade of
Grimsby re%uired an expenditure of 11,0001. at that port, niot to anticipate the future, but to provide additional acozmmodation now requisite. (gear.) In reference to their forign relations, they were now working cordially with the Great Northern, and were securely fortified by agreements on all sides against hostility from any quarter, In conclusion, he explained to the proprietors in detail the s.stem of checks and counter-checks which had for a long time past prevented the possibility of fraud in the transfer department, unless, indeed, several officers who were independent of each other deliberately conspired together for a dishonest purpose. (Applause.)
Mr. TURlttR, director, seconded the motion, and exlained, in reference to the propDsed extension to Buxton, that, although plans had been eposited for a line aU the way from Hydo to Burxton, that ras done merely to enable this company to negotiate on fair terms, but there was very little doubt that the negotiations wonld end in this comzany making only four miles of line, from Hyde to CompstaUl, which would cost 32,000. He thonght this measure absolutely necessary to protect the company's interests from invasion ina district whero they had already spent about 80,000f.
Mr. WILES, of Sheffield, moved, and Mr. BPRADSiixW seconded, an amendment for striking out clause 2.5 ofthe report, relative to the Baxton and Cleethorpes extensions, but this was negatived bya large man ority.
Previous to the adoption of the report, ono or two shareholders made observations reflecting on the remuneration of the general manaaer, Mr Watkin hbt, after hearing explanations from the chairman, Mr. Turner, Mr. Watkin and other gentlemen, wvho espressed entire confidence iu the general manager for his great exertions in bringing *b ut the present favourable position of the undertaking, the repoort waS adopted unanimously, as were also resolutiens declar.iF the various guaranteed preference dividends, and a dividend at the rate of 1 pmr cent perannumon the orinal stock, l payable onthe 4th of February. The retring directors and auditor were re eectd.
Mr. HADFIE.D, XP., moved a resolution for petitioning Parliament for relief from the present system of rating and taxing railway property, which'he denounced as unjust.
Mr. E. BUCKLEY seconded the motion, which was carried cinardmously.
The specnal meeting was then held, at which resolutions wrere unaninously passed authorizing the prop:v' agreement for promoting and leasing the projected= shton, Old. ham, and Guide-bridge ailwfay, and authorizing the directors to snake their proposed arrangements as to the Buxton extension.
An amendment proposed by 3r. WiLES, against the Oldham extension scheme, was lost by a large majority.
The proceedings concluded with votes of thanks to the directors and officers of the company.

Discipline Of Reading Gaol.
I DISCIPLINE OF READING GAOL.
TO TaE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Although I have not time to-day to reply at any length to the observations on Reading Gaol from the pen of my talented and philanthropic friend Mr. Pearson, which aDpeared in T7he Times this morning, yet I canuot allow a single day to pass without endeavouring to correct some misapprehensions which those remarks may have induced.
I will not trespass on your columns with my repeated advocacy or vindication of the principles of the system of prison discipline pursued in Berkshire, proving its freedom from alleged vices and its corrective efficacy; but I beg attentioa to a few unmistakeable figures and facts, which may show your readers that, while we maintain the soundness of a theory, the resalts are by no means unfavourable.
Mr. Pearson observes.-
" It was confidently affirmed by the euloglsts of the ystem that, although its first cost and annual outlay were considerable, it would be presently found that the number of prisoners would be so much reduced from the effects of sts reformatory influence that a considerable saving would be effected by the country in prisons and prosecutions as soon as its deterring and reformatory treatment was mnown and felt."
The learned gentleman procoeds to remind us that important evidence on this subject lies entombed in a ponderous blue book, to which your readers are referred. Now, Sir, withou citing statistics which I myself furnished the committee by whom that volume was published, and which tend to establish aU that has been affirmed, I quote from it the testimony of the Chairman of the visiting justices of Reading Gaol:-" It was obvious," observes that magistrate who hs most carefully watched the working of the plans,
"That if our reformatorv system was having any effect upon society the test would bo the number of prosecutions at the assizes and quarter sessions. I took therefore foar yea, from 1841 to 1844 inclusive, under what is called the 'hard labour system,' and compared them with the succeeding four years under our reformatory system, from 1845 to 1848 inclusive; and the committee will see that during the first four years the prosecutions were 736, and the expense to the county 9,5271.; and during the followW period of Christian instruction the prosecutions were
and the cost to the county 8,2571., making the reduction in the number of prosecutions 81 during the latter period, and the reduction in the cost 1,2701.; the further savng from maintenance, &c., bringing up the fiLancial saving from moral discipline to 2,303b"
But, lest it be said that the years here described are too few for any decided estimate of the comparative value of the system, I beg to add an extract from the last report of the visiting justices of Reading Gaol:-
" We think it wil be satisfactory to this county to observe that there has been, during the ten years from 1847 to 1856 inclusive, a gradual reduction in the number of prisoners from 999 to 866, and the annual expenditure has graduaUy fallen from 4,1711. to 2,4521.!'
These statistics are more remarkable because in some neighbouring counties, not having the advantage of the deterring and corrective discipline pursued in Berkshire, the number of prisoners has increased during the same period.
As respects short imprisonments, and the recent treat. ment of men convicted of the more heinous crimes, and especially the "ticket-of-leave aystem," I nearly agree in opinion with Mr. Pearson. When this system w4s adopted it seemed to me so defective, and likely to prove disastrous, that I strongly deprecated its continuance in a pamphlet, of which I forward you a copy, and I have YeCh no reason to retract any objections therein alleged.
I romain. Sir. vonr faithfnl r-F..

LOYPOuL. THUB.DAY, JTANUABY 22, 1857.
Our Parliamentary government, of which wre are all justly proud, is something more than an institution, a system, a principle, or a national safeguard. It is a peculiar medium of public ^ffatrs, a world of its own, a mode of political
existence. Its best and soundest defence is that it is the only government suited to the British taste, and is therefore a simple necessity. It is not a matter of choice that we are a naval rather than a military Power, and that our genius is rather commercial than artistic or philosophical. We believe, too, that our Parliament is the creation
of circumstances; and that, could we imagine s the whole British people, under some sudden and I uiaccountable persuasion, trying to do without the Houses of Lords and Commons, as, indeed, they have once tried, the two Houses would grow up again. But, being thus deeply planted in nature and fact, Parliament has also its own instincts and habits, its own senses of hearing and seeing, its own mode of doing things, which can no more be changed than an ox could be endowed with the speed of a racehorse or the mischief of a monkey. Hence the confessed and almost boasted fact that the British Legislature, while it is continually dictating to the Executive with a freedom and even caprice incredible to other countries,, and while it creates out of its own breast a new Administration every three or four years, nevertheless does not take an executive view of public affairs. It takes a deliberative, that is, a controversial view, rather than a strictly practical one. Next Tuesday week Parliament will reassemble, after six months of important negotiations, preparations, and events, whereof many deeply affecting us are not even yet known. By that raw theory of representation and self-government which every British child is taught from its infancy, it might be supposed that immediately on the meeting of our representatives we should bask in the daylight of political knowledge, as least as regards our own public affairs. That is a natural belief, but it is about as simple a one as that of the cockney tourist who thinks he has only to go to Switzerlaid, and the Alps winl all show themselves. We shall hear a speech from the Throne, containing little more than some notorious facts in the fewest possible words, and some announcements, not all novel, studiously brief. There will be a debate on the Addresses, wlhich, so far from making the Executive more communicative and candid, will have the effect of defining within still narrower limits the ground upon wbichl information may be expected, andtherefore given. Quiet noblemen and country gentlemen will move and second the Addresses, and it has occasionally happened that movers and seconders have not only been ignorant of what was going on or intended, but have afterwards turned round upon the Government, and alleged a de ception. There will, of course, be attacks upon Government by noble Lords and members who know no morc than we do ourselves. These attacks will be in the nature of indictments, and Ministers will take care not to travel out of the record unless it should be particularly convenient to do so. Every succeeding day will give more definiteness, speciality, and circumstantial form to the matters before Parliament, and before a month has passed we shall all be beginning our usual lament upon the prominence and preponderance of trivial and temporary over great and permanent questions.
But will there not be Ministerial explanations by the heads of departments ? Are there not the reports of Parliamentary Committees and Royal Commissions? Above all, are there not Bluebooks, and are they not inexhaustible mines of information? It is unnecessary just now to say what these things precisely are, and how much a man may learn from all these sources, if he goes the right way to work. They come, however, very plainly under the general description of special or argumentative documents got up for an occasion or a purpose. They teU us too little, and they tell us too much, and they tell us all kinds of things we do not want to hear; but they do not tell us in a manageable compass just the very things we do want to k-now. This is what we mean when we say that the British Executive does not speak and inform us as an Executive, but speaks through a Parliamentary and controversial medium. In the United States it is otherwise, and a citizen can there sit down and in the space of an hour or two thoroughly master the state of each department, all that it has done during the pa3t year, and all that it proposes for the future. Thus we have before uis in the annual report of the SEcRETARY of the NAvy a compendious statement, such as we could defy the most diligent and practised compiler to extract from all the speeches and reports of the whole British Admiralty, even aided by the Narnj List and the intelligence from the ports. Here we have an account of aU the squadrons ; their force; where they have been; what more are -wanted, and where; what new ships have been built, -with what guns, of what calibre; with a discussion on the comparative advantages of shot and shell. Then we have the condition of the crews; proposed changes ; new officers,-in a word, the whole naval history of the year, and the Ministerial projects for the session, all stated fully and plainly. As far as we are concerned, we have the opportunity of knowing that the Americans are by no means neglecting their Navy. They are omitting nothing that may bring it not only to an equality, but even to a superiority over the fleets of Europe. They are resolved not to be beaten, and they are not afraid to tell us so. The value of this document is that it exhausts the subject. It professes to tell everything, as far as certain reasonable limits will allow. The reader sits down with the conviction that, if the report has not becn actuaUy "cooked," it leaves him in possession of every fact of importance.
Now, wlly should not each department of the British Executive make, at the beginning of the session, or publish beforehand, just such a full, compendious report? No doubt, when Government is attacked on this or that part of our foreign policy, Lord PALMERSTON in the one house, and Lord CLARENDON in the other, will get up and defend either the Persian expedition or our part in the negotiations with Russia, or any other disputed point ; very likely, a dozen such points. The more, indeed, the better, for, when the Premier has floored his antagonists on one or two, lie will smother all the rest under
sonie brilliant platitude, and go off with flying colours. That will leave us not much wiser thaii it found us. It would, however, be a very different task to draw up a full accaunt of our relations with every foreign Power, what has been done by the Foreignoffice, what left undone, and why. Many an act of folly, many an oversight, many a ridiculous project, might have been averted, or at least repaired, if it had only been confessed in time. An honest statenment of our wrangles with Persia last February mighlLt have spared us a costly and possibly a sanguinary war. ThDen the CHA?oclHOn of the EXCHEQUER might publish an annual report, by which everybody might learn at a sitting the whole financial position of the country. Even the " Budget" fails to give us this knowledge. The Colonial-office must have a great deal to tell us, for there is always something new going on in our numerous colonies-convicts rojectedoraccepted, constitutions adopted, refused, or mended, the condition of the settlers, the yield of the harvests or the goldcfelds, and all we naturally want to know of regions which have afforded an asylum to so many of our acquaintances. The colonies never emerge into Parliamentary notice except apropos of a particular constitution, or a batch of
convicts, or some petty misunderstanding. A regular report of the SEORETARY for the COLONIES would insure that no subject, no colony, no interest was forgotten.
But the report on the American Navy is more particularly suggestive of one upon ours. At present there is no such mystery, no lore so recondite, no knowledge so unattainable as the state of the British Navy. Certain Admiralty returns tell us all the ships in and out of commission, and where they are, or ought to be. But, as they say the children of this age are the men of the future, the vessels now on the stocks are the future fleet of England. So what ships are building? How many "leviathans of the deep," those pompous three-deckers, igrqevum peculs, madefor the sole purpose apparently of consuming men, coal, and money ? How many frigates fit to show beside the Merrimac, whether in peace or in war ) How many of those sloops of war, and those gunboats, upon which the American report before us dwells with such fondness and complacency ? What improvements have we made and adopted in our gtuns ? Is what " VYuLcA " tells us in another column true? What has been done, or is to ba done, to render the service more attractive and the discipline more perfect ? A general report would comprise all these points of information. The burden now lies rather with the Opposition or the public than the Minister, for if the latter is not challenged he is held free to be coimmunicative or not, as he pleases. It is our fault if we let him hold his tongue, and he generally contrives to get some advantage over us. But such a report as we describe, and as, indeed, we have in the American example before us, throws the burden on the Admiralty, which may be called to account for every omission. From this department, then, at least, we hope to hear, at an early date, what we are doing to meet these magnificent fiigates and their tremendous armaments, those 135pounders. Are we only providing huge targets, to be rent, and raked, and sent to shivers by their nimbler and more powerful assailants, or are we preparing the British sailor to fight upon more equal terms? What craft have we got for the next war in shoals and creeks ? What are we preparing ? What further suggestions has the First Lord of the Adniiralty to offer ? This is just what we have in the American report, and but for the narrow, contentious, Parliamentary practice, we should look for the same from the mouth or the pen of Sir CHAMRLRS WOOD.
The Court of Queen's Bench has decided in the
The Court of Queen's Bench has decided in the case of ALICIA RACE that in the absenice of express stipulations in the father's will the child must be delivered up to her mother. We cannot venture to impugn the decision, although in this case the rude of law appears to act with extraordinary hardship. There cannot be a moment's doubt that the intention of the dead father was that his children should be brought up in the faith which he himself held. If equity could have been brought in to decide upon the question, ALTCIA RACB would have been left in the Protestant school at Hatnpstead. The case is told in a few words. A Sergeant of Marines, a Protestant-LAuI-IA RACE by name-is killed before Petropaulovski. A few days before his death he leaves the guardianship of his children to his wife, who was a Roman Catholic. The Romanist opinions of the wife must have been of an extremely moderate kind, since she consented to marry a Protestant without any ante-nuptial stipulations as to the form of religious belief in which the children were to be brought up. Sergeant RACE, however, being himself a Protestant and a religious man, as is proved by the letter which he wrote to his wife a day or two before he was killed in action, left her guardian of the two children. Duling his lifetime he had brought them up in the Protestant faith -he had taken them to Protestant places of worship-he had taught them Protestant prayers; and to this course of religious training the Ronianist mother had not offered any objection. WVell, the father dies before Petropaulovski, leaving it as an injunction upon the mother that his two children should be brought up in the "fear of the LORD." For eight months after the news of her husband's death had been received in England his widow took the tso children to a Protestant place of worship.
That was the manner in which she interpreted. the wishes of her dead husband wbile the first grief for his loss was fresh upon her. Time, however, wore on, and as sorrow oozed out Romanism crept in. The priests of her own fait,,
got around her, and persuaded her that it was necessary for the salvation of her children and for her own that first the boy and then the girl should be removed from the schools to which they had been sent nnder the auspices of the Commissioners of the Patriotic Fund. She applied for the delivery of her son, a lad under 12 years of age, and her request was instantly complied with, as the boy himself made no opposition to the claim. The persons, however, who had interested themselves in her case informed the mothler that they could do nothing for the boy unless the little girl too-the child of 10 years of age-was also removed from the taint of Protestant instruction.
ALcIA RACE refused to return to her mother to be educated in the tenets of the Roman Churci. This was the point which was brought before the Queen's Bench. Lord CAmPBELL has decided that the law of England in such a case affirms the guardianship of the surviving parent. There can be no doubt that Sergeant RACE was a Protestant, that during his lifetime he had brought up his children as Protestants, and that his wish was that after his death his children should be broughlt up as Protestants. So far there is no dispute. The counsel on both sides are agreed about the facts. The only question is whether, upon the general rile that the guardianship in such a case reverts to the surviving parent, ALICIA RACE must be handed over to the custody of her mother. We fear it cannot be helped. However hardly the law may operate in this individual case, it is necessary for the wellbeing of society that the widow should have the guardianship of the children up to a certain age, saving in cases of gross immorality or unfitness. Had Sergeant RACE left particular directions that his children should be brought up as Protestants, no doubt the guardian would have been bound to follow his injunctions. This, however, the Ssrgeant neglected to do, and consequently he ha3 left his unfortunate offspring exposed to th3 machinations of the QuiRK, Ga=Niox, ani SNAr of Rome. We deplore such a result, but. if the law of the land be as it is laid dowa by Lord CmAPE3LL, we do not see how its application can be avoided. Greater inconveniences would follow from the misapplication of a general rule than from its unfortunate incidence in a particular instance. The case of ALIcIA RACE is just the case of a person who is garotted.a-of a shopkeeper who is swindled-of an orphan cheated out of his inheritance by an informality in a dead. If there be informality in the indictment, or in the deed, the criminal must escape, and the orphan must suffer. The fact is that Sergeant RACE neglected to- draw his will properly, and the Romanist priests have hit the blot. We, shoull regret to write anything which would weaken the power of parental authority over the child, and no doubt, however hardly it may apply in this particular instance, the child must endure
the consequences of the parent's neglect. The rule of English law appears to be, that until the age of 14 years the parent or guardian, not the Roman priest or Protestant clergyman, must have the custody, moral and physical, of the child. The decision of the Queen's Bench is an anti-Papist decision-that is, it is in favour of the parent, and against the priest. The rule, as we trust, will be remembered in all future cases when the parts are assigned to different performers. M;eanwhile AicIA RAcF is to be handed over to the Roman advisers of her mother; and, although we have little confidence in the logical powers and theological learning of a child of such tender years, it is to be hoped that affection for the memory of her dead father may carry the poor child through the four years of trial which are before her.
If a man should ask what great question, tran-
If a man should ask -what great question, transcending every other, is to be solved by the English people if they regard the future welfare of their country, he would certainly receive a variety of answers. MIany would say that there is no question of paramount importance, and that all we have to do as individuals is to earn our living, aud, as a community, to enact law reforms and manage carefully the public expenditure. Others, again, would have their favoiuite subjects, some popular, some neglected,-Parliamentary reform, popular education, church extension; then would come the ballot, the repeal of the Maynooth grant, and al the kindred themes of declamation. There would be pleaders for universal art-instruction, and votaries of the scheme for raising all the revenue by a gigantic Incomefax. Now, many of these subjects are of the highest importance, but there is one other wlich we think lies at the basis of all that is to be donae for the good of England now and hereafter. Many of our great questions are settling themselves ; most of our greatest difficulties have passed away through our exertions and the lapse of time. Ireland is pacified, the Colonies are attached by better government, pauperism is no longer crushing the energies of the country; abroad, Russia no longer presses on Europe, and the sleep of statesmen is not disturbed by dreams of an empire built up by force and extending from the frozen ocean to the Mediterranean. We have, then, time to consider quietly deep matters of national concern. Deepest and most serious among these is the great question for England, " How are "the health, strength, and energy of large town "populations to be preserved?" We will not now allude to the moral part of the subject-to the teaching and civilizing of crowded masses; the question is merely how the town life, which by general consent has a tendency to deteriorate the human being physically, can be deprived of its evil effects. It cannot be denied that this is a subject of vital interest--a subject which must every year grow in importance, and will before long make the chief demands on the philanthropy and science of the country. England is now not so much a land apart as the metropolis and workshop of the world; the tendency of things is visibly to change the population of these islands into manufacturers for the entire earth, while distant nations will supply us with those agricultural productions which our own country is of insufficient extent to yield. Yet England is an independent nation, and must have its soldiers and sailors for defence, its strong men for labour of all kinds, and its healthy women to transmit an undeteriorated progeny. The great subject of the health of towns must therefore have an importance more fundamental and more enduring than any mere political question. Any information on it is valuable, and the laws by which health is preserved in crowded districts canmot be too soon or too completely studied.
A summary has been published of births, deaths, and causes of deaths inLondon, with meteorological observations, during the 15 years from 1842 to 1856. The results made k-nown by this document are by no means discouraging. It seems fully proved that the health of man, and, consequently, his strength and powers of exertion, can be improved to such an extent by good regulations that the mortality of a country district shall not be much exceeded. In the middle of the year 1856 it is computed that London contained 2,616,248 inhabitants; the females being in excess of the males by 165,000. In the year there were born 86,833 children, and, according to a rule which holds invariably in this large population, the number of males exceeded the number of females. In the same period 56,786 persons died. The births increase more or less rapidly wvith the population, while the deaths diminislh, having been in 1856 less than in any previous year except 1852. The excess of births over deaths in the year was 30,047, and, with the return of soldiers and sailors from the seat of war and the usual immigration from the provinces, it is calculated that London contained at the close of 1856 about 60,000 inhabitants more than at the close of 1855. That is, in the space of 12 months a population equal to that of Brighton has been added to the already overgrown metropolis.
During the year 1856 the public health was " unusually good." For 10 years the annual deaths in London have been on the average 25 in the 1,000, while in 1856 the proportion was 22 in the 1,000. But this health was not enjoyed equally by all the divisions. In the northern and western divisions the mortality wYas 21 ; in the eastern 23. This is in accordance with former returns, though the increased mortality in the eastern districts is not as great as might have been looked for considering the inferior class of dwellings and the nature of the trades carried on witlhin their limits. No particular mention is made of the parts lying south of the river, but it is probable that they still retain their unhappy preeminence as the seats of fever and cholera.
The public wil learn with pleasure that one of the greatest scourges of humanity has now lost its chief terrors. Smallpox is not extinct, but it is narrowly circumscribed in its range, and proves fatal comparatively seldom. If the years 1855 and 1856 may be taken as a fair example, the disease continually decreases. The fatal cases in the first quarter of 1855 were 328; "there"after the quarterly numbers were, 1.96, 177, 194, "146, 108, having decreased almost continuously "till they were only 74 in the last quarter of 1856." The annual mortality from scarlatina has been very perceptibly less since 1851. In 1854, when it was most fatal, the deaths were 3,439 ; in 1856 they were only 1,795. Hoopingcough shows a decrease, and measles is the only one of the four epidemics which shows an increase. In 1855 it was fatal in 864 cases, but last year in 1,445. The report mentions in conclusion a singular fact-namely, that the number of persons who died in 116 public institutions was 10,381. Thus, "nearly one person out of " five who died in the year closed his days under " a roof provided by public law or private charity." This concise sleetch of the health of the greatest colection of human beings in the world is certainly not without the deepest interest. It is gratifying to7 find that, in spite of the inordinate size of the
capital, the increasing filth of the river, the i volumes of smoke poured out from innumerable chimneys, and the too generally intemperate habits of the population, London still may claim to be the healthiest city in Europe. How far this is owing to a fact which detracts from the pic-
turesqueness of its appearance-namely, the width of the streets and the smallness of the houses, we cannot say; but, at any rate, the report gives encouraggement to those who think that the evils of town life are not inevitable, and that by proper tanitary arrangements and the appliances which science and civilization afford we may hope to be spared the calamity of short-lived and enfeebled populations.

PROPOSED TSTImOnINAL TO THE NEW BISHOP OF

This mode of expressing the respect of the clergy and laity of the diocess to their bishop has been decided upon because it is known that for some time prior to his translation Bishop Longley was contemplating the establishment of a fund for such a purpose. It appears that there are 253 benefices in the diocess the endowments of which are below 1501., and it is proposed to raise, during the next two years, a sum of not less than 10,000. for the purpose of increasing such endowments, and of aidingelergymen in obtaining the grants to be mado by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners under the new regulations for the distribution of the funds at their disposal. The meeting was addressed by the chairman, the ev. Dr. Hook, tr. John Gott, Colonel Tempest, the Rev. W. Sinclaxir, the Rev. Mrr.

THE AccIDENT IN MANCHESTER CATHEDRAL.- On Monday we noticed the fall, on Sunday afternoon, durig divine service, of a great bulk and weight of plaster mouldings attached to the lower surface of one of the cross beams in the ceiling of the north gallery of the cathedral nave. On Tuesday afternoon the churchwardens of the cathedral had a meeting on the subject, and the fouo wing report was laid before them by Mr. James P. Holden, the architect of the chapter, and also of the churchwardens during the recent restoration at the cathedral:-
" I have examined that part of the ceiling orer the gall-ry in the north chapel where the lower mouldings or one of th. crops beams and some f the decorations fell down durteg divine service on Sunday aftermoos). I caref,slly inspected the beam to which the mouldings that fell were secured. I tfoed it in gool condition, and more than siuxficient to support the mouOings thst werer attached to it. I subsequently esaminioel the brleket
which are secured to the under side of the bosaes, to whicli aLre f3aatened the laths that support the mortar alid cement necetsary to ferns the mouldings under the boams. I have enclosed to yoll ections ot the bean, with the moulding, it supports, for your Inspection. It will be seen (from the section) that the brackets, whitch are nailed to the under side of the beans, are unusually small: they are about 4iun. by 2.in and lin, in thickness, and are divided off aboist 12n, from centre to centre: they are secured to the bean,s with vrougbt-iron naUs. Some of the brackets (where the plaster felll were split quite acro's: thisnmsthav been doune when they were nailedI ixp at lim;t the5s
brackes could be of no support whatever to the mRss cf materials below them. On twvo other of the brackets the dry rot his made colsiderable progress; but had aU the brackets been perfectlv sound. and fixed in the inost secure manner to the beams, they were quite too small to Bupport the lathwork and mortar they had to carry, as swll be seen by thesection. The laths usedodare urdhaiy hplat lath -. secured to the brackets with cast iron lath nails. I found in seviral places the lath nails had drawn out of the brackets, and in otber places broken off, Rs* that the moulldigs under this beam must have been in an unsafe state for souse time. ThIsis scarcely to be wondered at. when the great quantity of mortar is takeu into consideration which had been laid on by the plasterereto form the moulding& Xwould recommend that much larger brackets should be usedl in re-formlin the mouldings, as shown by the blue dotted linte on the scetion, aud thatthese brackets be sell secured to the beams. If this is doue the weight of materials wil be reduced to onn-third of wbat was used in the former mouldings, and no damage cnu again ocur froma the mouldinps falllng off. I exareined the mnoulding, on tho cross beams in the other part of the ceilieg. I found cracks in several of tbem. The mouldtnga under twoof thesebeamsaeprear to have settlod down about half an Inch. I would recommend that these two be taken down, and now bracket. Sixed oni toe beams, as described above. The celu over the gallery In iBrowne's chapel is in better condition. I obseve hbt two small cracks in the c4lng. There appears to be no iummediate dangter of any of the mouldings falling from this ceiling; still, it is a matter for cotlAderatton to the esurchvvwadeus (sincean accident has hapPenedl wether they hualnot betterhave the manner of securiog the mou~ldnwgs in the gallery examined, and if they are not secure to have them maae so.-I am, gentlemen, yours
Iespeetfully."
After duly considering the report, and conferring with Mr. Holden, the churchwardens came to the resolution to close the north gallery for a short time, including next Sunday, in order to enaole the workmen to remove the mortar mouldings from the other beams in the gallery, some of which are considered to be in a daugerous condition, and to replace these with lightermonuldings, securely fastened to brackets niore fitted to support their weight. For Sunday next, of course, siitable accomsmodation for the occupants of pews in the north gallery will be provided in other parts of the church-lla1anc1ecr Ouardian.
THE CIHAITIST FP.osT.-Last night Mr. John Frost gave a leature to a numerous body of the working classes, at the Assembly-rooms, Nottingham, on "Transportatios." Mr. Edward Hart, a town-councillor, was chosen chairman, and introduced Mr. Frost to the mueeting. The lecturer was received with protracted cheering. He commenced by an attack upon the aristocracy, and said he knew that any man who atteimpted to shake their power, or to make them disgorge their plunder, must do so with his life in his hand. MIr Frostproceeded to saythathe had convertedone of the most oniiiient judges of Van Diemen's Land to the principles of the charter, and then described the treatment of convicts ia that colony. From 1788 to 18M52 more than 10,000,G001. of the public money had been expended to degrade and brttify their fellow-subjects. In conclusion the lecturer adduced various statements to prove the prevalence of crime in the penal settlements. Be said it was a very common thing for murders to be committed there, and apparently without any cause. But the vict-ilns were destroyed because they would not submit to the propensities of their fellow-convicts. The lectrer expressed his intention of compelling the Government to briung him before a committee of the House of Commons. It they refused he would appeal to the people of Enigland. It was evdent, he said, that there must be a change in our present system, and be blieved he eould point out a sure remedy for the horrible state of thinrs which at
sent esisted. lr. Frost resumed his seat zmnd tremendous plaudits. A vote of thanks was accorded to the lecturer and cheers were given for "Ernest Jones."

DUBLIN, WEDINESDA.Y. THE QUEIE1S YCOLLEGES I
The Evening Post, the Irish Whig organ, has the following remarks in relation to the Royal Commission about to issue for inquiring into the working of the Queen's Colleges in Irelsnd:-
"The Queen's Colleges have been a sufficient time in operation to render it expedient that an inquiry should take place regarding the system of management and the course of education, and also to ascertain to what extent those institutions have been successful in affording increased facilities for academical instruction. The first step to promote provincial colleges for Ireland had taken place in Cork, and Mr.Wyse, atpresent British Minister atAthens, and other distinguished friends of education had taken an active part in the movement. Some years after Sir RobertPeel brought before the House of Commons a project on the subect, and succeeded in obtaining a Parliamentary grant, wiiich has since been continued. An act passed in 1845, under which the three Queen's Colleges were established, and those institutions were opened for the admission of students towards the close of 1849. In August of the following year the Queen's University was founded. We have learnt that a commission is immediately to issue for the purpse of inquiring into the progress and present state and condition of the Queen's CoUleges in Belfast, Cork, and Galwvay. It appears to us thar a commission for such an object is a judicious measure. It must be the meats of affording the Legislature and the public accurate information on a subject which has latterly been much discussed in the newspapers here and in England; and wlk h, in all likelihood, will attract attention in Parliament. 1nwing to obvious causes, and particularly to the persecuting tendency of the penal code for eo many years, in placing penalties upon instruction, University education has been in effect withhold from the Catholic body. For that very reason it has become the duty of the State to afford all possible facilities for the extension of education among all classes, free from any interference whatever with the reli. gion of any denomination. On this account, and for other reasons, the inquiry about to take place wiUlnaturallyexcite the liveliest interest in the pablic mind."

The Venerable William Fitzgerald, Archdeacon of Kildare and rector of Monkstown, has been appointed by the Lord-Lieutenant to the Bishopric of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross.
The new Bishop, who was private chaplain to Archbishop Whately, was believed to be a supporter of the national system of edaucation, but since the Archbishop's secession from the Board it is reported that Dr. Fitzgerald's views have also undergone some modification upon the education question.
St. Martin's-Hall.
ST. AfARTII'S-HALL.
One of the best performances of Mr. HeUah's " Fir-t Upper Singing School" is invariably Mendessohui's Eli,ah which was given last night with more than ordinary success. As in other places, too, the attraction of Elija . rivals that of Thc Arfssiah, and-as on previous occasions when this great oratorio has been presented-St. Martin'shaU was crowded to suffocation.
Among the principal singers, nevertheless, there were only two of the first rank-viz., Miss Dolby and Mr. Sims Roeves the first of whom sang the chief contralto and the last th) chief tenor music with their accustomed excellence. bliss Dolby obtained a loud encore in the air, " Oh rest in the Lord," and Mr. Sims Reeves another in " Then shall the righteous stand forth;" and both, to their credit be it said, resisted the misjudged importunity of the audienes until to hold back any longer would have amounted almost to a mark of disrespect. What a pity that this stupid practice of forcing singers to repeat certain passafes in works the grand effect of which depends upon their uninterrupted contin.xity cannot be arrested by some conventional provision! It has become a fixed habit to encore Mr. Sims Reeves, no matter where or what he sings, whether it be at the fag end or the early beginning of a concertwhether the music intrusted to him be a trumpery ballad about some clap-trap of the day, or one of the finest songs of a great master. The result, however, is rather a tax upon the physical endurance of the singer than a compliment to his genius ; and we are quite sure-allow. ing fur that thirst for applauso inherent in all who solicit public favour-that Mr. Sims Reeves would feel more perfectly satisfied with a general verdict of approval, testifying that he had done his best, than with such feverish demonstrations as exhibit on the part of the audience rather a hankering for quantity than an appreciation of quality, and which not only harass the artist, but rob the music of its legitimate effect. It is all very well (for those, at least. who do not object to a surfeit of isaelody) to encore isolated pieces in a concert wholly composed of heterogeneous miscellanies ; but near the conclusion of a long and elaborate sacred oratorio, like Elijah, to insist upon the repetition of an air is both inconsiderate and indiscreet. It is time this system of making "points" (where the compo'er imagined none) should cease, and that groat works should be valued first on their own account, and thens on account of the general merits of their execution. Singers of eminence would lose nothing by this, since at the end of a good performance everybody, while imbued with a vivid impression of the whole, would stil distinctly rernember which among them had most highly distinguished himself.
The soprano music last night was divided between bMisses Banks and Spiller-Miss Banks taking the most hnportant share. Neither of these ladies can be said at present to hold an acknowledged position before the musical public. Both, however, have good voices, and both are careful tingers. The grand air, " Hear ye' Israel," and the soprano solo in the quartet with chorus, " Holy, holy," may not yet be entirely within the grasp of Miss Banks, but it must be admitted that few young aspirants have attempted them with mears more readily at comnmand, or with greater satisfaction to the public. Among the " encores" was the unaccompanied trio, " Lift thine eyes to the mountains," in which the two abovemientioned ladies were assisted by Miss Paluier, who in the contralto music played the part of satellite to her more experienced comrade, Miss Dolby. The habit of redemanding this trio is ridiculous, since it forms part of the chorus into which it immediately leads-"Hle watching over Israel" Trio and chorus are in the same key, carry out the same sentiment, and illustrate the same incident. To separate them is to destroy the poetical meaning of the composer; and separation is virtually made when, for the sake of repeating th art whi,h is allotted to the unaccompanied female voices, the commencement of the chorus is deferred. These and other absurdities have become stereotyped, and so long as bad taste-or, to speak in milder language, want of consideration-prevails are likely to remain perpetual obstructionis to the entire comprehension nfendelssohn's imperishablework. Such ad captacndusm effects were never contemplated by the great musician, who in the illustration of scriptural incdent and text was Handel's only rival; and, though we may not sympathi7e with the somewhat affected etiguette that forbids applausc at the concerts of the Sacred Harmonic Society, we are altoether averse from that trivial practice whichl, for the gratiteation of a momentary fancy, sets at nought the intentions of the composer, and metamorphoses what is meant to excite grave and edifying impressions into vehicles for mere commonplace manifestations.
The music of Elijah was undertaken last night lay Mr. Thomas, one of our youngest and, at the same time, most promising bass singers. Mr. Thomas evidently understands what he has to sing, and in many instances his execution comes up to his conception; but in the mechanism of his art he has still much to acquire which is well worth his serious study. The other vocalists were Messrs. G. Calkin and H. Barnby. The chorus, for the most part, went even better than usual; but what did Mr. Hullah mean by taking
"Behold God the Lord" at so slow a pace? He is old enough to remember Mendelssohn's own tcnmpo, and intelli gent enough to profit by the example.
The oratorio next announced for performars is Handel's Israd in Egypt-the delight of musical conm 4leurs, and one of the most prodigious inspirations of its immiortal composer.

The letter of our Malta correspondent, dated the 15th inst., mentions, among the latest movemensts there, the -departure, on the 11th, for Sicily and Naples, of the Osprey m8ensloop, and the arrivals and departures of the regular mail steamers.
Yesterday the officers and men ol the (Chatham division -1f Royal Marine Light Infantry, to the number of above 1,200, were assembled on their parade-grounid for the purpose of witnessing the presentation of silver medals, together with a money gratuity, which had been awarded by the Lords Commissioners of thse Addmirilty to ColourSergeant H. King, Colour-Sergeant G. Fox, Corporal Printer, and Private Berell, Royal Marines, for long service and meritorious conduct. Sergeant King has been in the service 30 years, 2.5 of which he has been a non-commissioned officer. The Lords of the Admairalty have awarded him an annuity of 5l. Sergeant Fox has served in the Royal Marines 21 years, 17 of which as a non-commissioned offlcer. In addition to his medl1 he has been awarded a gratuity of 151. Corporal Printer has been -24 years in the corps, and wears five good-conduct stripes. ile has also been avwarded a gratuity of lOt Private Berell has 21 years' service. He is also decorated with the Caffro tMedal, and wears four good-conduct badges. Their Lord-ehips have granted him a gratuity of 51. The battalion 3having been formed into a hollow square, Colonel J. A. Philips,,the commandant, addressed the troops, expressing the ijsure it afforded him to distribute the medals, which
e tfusted the men selected would long live to wear. He then fastened the medal to each man's breast, the proceed. ings being witnessed with much interost.
Yesterday morning the ceremony of drumming a soldier -out of the service took place at Wool wichi. The man, whose ,name is Leeward, a gunner belonging to the 12th battalion Royal Artillery, had been convicted of stealinig a comrade's 'boots, and other disgraceful conduct, for which about a fortnight ago he received the first part of the punishment allotted him-namely, o0 lashes. Since that time he has been under treatment in tha infirmary, and having received the medical certificale to leave the 'hospital, was yesterday morning brought on the parade-ground fronting the Artillery barracks, where the entire battalion, together with 20 men of the respective battalions stationed at Woolwich, was formed into two lines, extending the whole length of the ground. On arriving there the sentence of the court martial was read over, after which two stout drummer-boys stripped off his facings and 'buttons. This part of the ceremony having been speedily despatelsed, the "Rogue's March" was struck upi by the drums and fifes, and the prisoner was marched forward in charge of an armed escort as far as the centre of the lines, where lie was hAlted. The sentence was again read over, after which ths muisic recoinmenced, and the procession con. tinued its march to the end of the lines of sohliers, when a final halt was made and the sentence read a third time, and the prisoner was iguominiously marched out of the garrison, and forwarded thence to Coldbath fields for the term of six tmonths, at the conclusion of which he will be dismissed lier Majesty's service. The prisoner has long been a marked mnan, and only a short time before lealving the Crimea he underwent corporal punishnient for having stolen a horse.
A number of artillerymen haNing been discharged from the service sinec the order was issued for reducing theranks -of the corps, many of them, although of doubtful character, and who were engaged during the stress occasioned by the wvar, were permitted to retain their uniforms, not having lheen convicted of crime. This has led to the conviction that the frequent occurrences which have taken place recently at Woolwich, and which have been committed by men wearing the uniforms of the Artillery, have been the -acts of mnen discharged from the service. On Taesday night a party of six, all of whom wore the uniform of gunners of the Royal Artillery, attacked a private of one of the field batteries stationed at the cantonment at the extremity of the common, and robbed him of the contents of his pocket-namely, 5s. 101. and a pocket knife. The poor fellow reached his quarters with much difficulty, his head and face presenting a frightful spectacle, literally covered with bruises.
Rear-Addmiral Richards and Rear-Admiral Eden, Lords -Commissioners of the Admiralty, paid an official visit to Wool,-ich dockyard yesterday, and, having been joined by the commodore-superiatendent of the yard, they inspected the smitheries and boat-building establishments at the -extremity of the yard, and examined the new works in jProgress there. They also went over the steam sawmills, and passed some time in examining the working of the newly-erected planing machine, the most ingeniously-con. trived piece of mechanism in the yard.
Rear-Admiral Clement Milward, 184-G, died on the 14th inst. at Tullogher, in the county of Kilkenny. He entered the navy on the 20th of October, 17 93, on board the Alarm, ;32, Captain Lewis Robertson, and in the following year was severely wounded as midshipman of that frigate in an attack -at Point a Pitre, Guadaloupe. Alter two yearse servitude, stiU on the West India station, in the Veteran, 64. and the Solebay, 32, both commanded by Captain W. H. Baynton, and as master's-mate in the Etrusco, Captain James Ianson, he joined in 1796 the Prince of Wales, 98, flagship of Rear-Admliral llenry Harvey, under whoLm, in February, 1797, he witnessed the surrender of Trinidad. In October
f the latter year he becanme Acting Lieutenant of the Yavourite sloop, CaDtain Lord Camelford, and during that service be handed the pistol to Lord Camelford on the wellknown occasion when Lord Canmelford shot Lieutenant Peterson, of iler Majesty's ship Woolwichi, for mutinous conduct at English Harbour, Antigaa. In August, 1790, being then again in the Prince of Wales, under Lord Hugh Seymour, he assisted as midship. man at the capture of Sarinam, and on that occasion he was again invested with the rank of acting-lieu. tenant, and appointed to the Surinam, a prize corvette of 20 guns, to which vessel, commanded by Captain Christopher Cole, the Admiralty confirmed hioi by commission dated the 8th of July, 1800. Invalided home from the Yest Indies in October, 1802, he subsequently joined, on the 12th of July, 180.3, the Phaeton, 3S, Captains George Cockburn and John Wood, in which frigate, after serving before Havre de Grace and conveying Mr, Merry, the British Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States, he proceeded to the East Indies, and was afforded an opporttunity of participating, when in company with the Harler sloop, in an action of two hours, fought on the 2d of August, 1805, with the 'French 36-gun frigate S6mihlante and several batteries at the entrance of tihe Straitsofjit. Bernardin's, Philippine Islands; 3d of April, 1807, he was appointed to the Rassell. 74, Cap. tain Caulfield, also in the East Indies; an-I in September, 180S, and March, 1809, to the Ponup6e and Belleisle, 74, both commanded by Captain George Cockburn, under whom, in the Pompee, he assisted at the reduction of Mar. -tinique. On his return to England in the Belleisle, with the surrendered Governor and garrison of the latter island, he was presented a commander's commission, dated the 14th of June, 1809. He was next (28th of December, 1810, and Sth of November, 1811) appointed to the Elk and Mercury sloops on the West India station, where, on the 1st of January, 1813, he was nominated acting captain of the Herald, 20. Being confirmed to that vessel on the 28th of May following, and continuing in her until the 11th of October, 1815, he succeeded in effecting the capture of several of the enemy's vessels, and took an active part in the expedition against New Orleans. He accepted the rank of 'retired rear-admiral the 13t of October, 1846.
The operations of the new Coastguard service commenced on Monday, when Commodore Eden hoisted his broad pennant on board Her Majesty's guardship Southampton, C aptaini Charlewood, in Harwich harbour. In the fore. noon the officers and men of the Harwich division of Coast. guard mlustered on board the Southampton, and in the afternoon were inspected by Cosmmodore Eden, who divided them into three classes-viz., those fit for service in the fleet when required, those only fit for Coastguard service, and those requiring medical survey. The officers are to be placed on the books of the Southampton as additional for -Coastguard service. On Tuesday Commnodore Eden inspected the Southampton, expressing himself pleased with her cleanliness and good order; also inspected the cutter', anen of the Coastguard, dividing them into the three former. neastioned classes. In the afternoon Commodore Eden, accompanied by, Captain Charlewood, left Harwich for the Aldbhorough division of the station, to continue the in-
spection.

Large Guns In Russia, America, And England.
LARGE GUNS IN RUSSIA, AMERICA, AND I
ENGLAND.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-The progress made in the American navy in the creation of an enlarged marine and in the introduction of guns of immense calibre suggests an inquiry into the operations of the authorities at Woolwich,-what are they doing towards the maintenance of that supreniacy which has been the traditional boast of the English navy?
Are we to continue to rely upon our floating castles with their grim array of 68-pounders, or upon our new gunboats, armed with guns of no greater power, when other nations are adopting weapons specified to carry proiectiles of ] 351b. each, capable of throwing, as you stated the other day, more metal than four 32-pounders ? The two great exponents of opposite principles, Russiaand America, are devoting their attention to the manufacture of guns capable of throwing shot and shell of enormous weight ; but no visible steps are being taken by the English Government to keep pace with her late foe and her giant son. An immense steam battery is being constructed at New York, attention to which was first drawn in your columns; and in St. Petersburg the Czar is engaged in the erection of one of the largest forges, iron shipbuilding yards, and engine factories in the world, on one of the principal quays in the Governrnent part of the city. The operations are being conducted with the greatest secrecy and despatch. That the works are on a gigantic scale will be evident to the least scientific, when I state that 14 steam hammers are being placed in the forge, for the purpose of constructing, together with forgings for marine engines for the Russian navy, monster wrought-iron ordnance. The works are being built chiefly by English mechanics, from one of whom, just returned to England, this information,is derived.
At the commencement of the late war much was written and said about increasing the calibre and power of our ordnance. You isserted that large guns
of enormous strength and size could be produced I with the iftprovements for forging iron introduced since the previous war. Results have proved the accuracy of the suggestion, but a fashion prevailed at that time of having wrong men in high places, and the rule was observed of giving the order for a trial gun of large calibre to an engineer, whose experience differs as much from that of the forgemaster, whose business it is to'make large masses of wrought iron, as that of a manufacturer from the experience of the tailor of the cloth he cuts up. About this time official circulars were forwarded to certain iron manufacturers, inviting them to attend at Woolwich Arsenal (at their own expense it was distinctly intimated), to give the old select comnmittee of artillery officers the benefit of their views and experience upon the subject of the manufacture of large ordnance, and more especially of wrought-iron guns. Some complied. One firm, which had some years before successfully made the largest wrought-iron gun in existence, offered, at their own risk and expense, to construct wrought-iron guns of 12, 13, 14, or 15 inch bore, only stipulating for payment in case they stood the requisite proofs. This was too simple and practical a mode to find favour at the Circumlocutionoffice, and a civil letter was despatched to them, respectfully declining their offer. Had the Government accepted that proposition, and cordially assisted in providing suitable vessels for these proposed monster guns, one or more woula have been in the Baltic the first campaign; and, what about Cronstadt then? This part of the question 1 leave for Sir Charles Napier, Sir Robert Peel, and the Grand Duke Constantine to settle in their own friendly and pleasant way, merely suggesting that Cronstadt, and perhaps the war, might not have survived the first year of the contest,-such vast results might have been attained by a single moderately sized gunboat, with one gun dropping 3001b. shot into the forts at leisure, at a distance of between three and four miles, where the little g,unboat would scarcely have been seen, and, if seen, wvould have been far beyond the range of the Russian guns.
But the opportunity was thrown away, and the war prolonged. As I have said, the manufacture of a monster gun was intrusted to an engineer, certainly one of the most eminent in the country, but, as such, having no experience in the practical forging of large masses of iron, and a grant of public money was made to him for the purpose of building a manufactory for the special purpose of making this gun. This of course occupied considerable time. The war was going on, and the gun was wanted; yet nine months were spent in a magnificent experiment. At the end of that period it was announced that the manufacture of the monster gun was a failure, and there was no doubt about the fact ; so far it was a failure. Redtape had another triumph, having managed " how not to do it;" and wrought iron as a material for ordnance was in imminent danger of being put back for another score of years. This thiumph was not of long duration. The same private firm that 15 moniths before had offered to construct monster guns oll the "no success no pay" prmciple-thinking, I suppose, that it would be useless again to make that proposition-now stepped forward and offered to make a gun as large or larger than the one which the Government had failed to construct, and present it, free of all cost, to the nation, with the single, and apparently singular stipulation, that after due proof at Liverpool it should be immediately used against the eneuiy. Strange stipulation ! Could it be that these hard-headed forgemen had an impression that their present would not be acceptable, and that every exertion would be made by the Barnacles to shelve it ? It appears something like it; the monster gun was made, and proved by the proper officer sent down from Woolwich for that purpose; and, as your readers are aware, that proof was satisfactory, not only to the Ordnance authorities, but to all the naval and military officers present. The manufacturers, wishing next to show its defensive capacity against the so-called impregnable iron-plated floating batteries, forged a large wroughtiron plate of exactly the same strength and section as those which cover our floating batteries, and set it up as a target, placing it against nine solid baulks of timber end on, well strutted and secured, and still more solidified by a heap of sand. The first shot at pointblank range knocked this plate to shivers, carrying large pieces of the fragments, some of them several hundred pounds' weight, 300 yards beyonid the target. The knowing ones said, " Sic trantif glo Ub" of the floating batteries ; that their brief sun had set; and that any hostile floating batteries vould find the monster guns that would be mounted on allour forts giving a very satisfactory account of the non-resistance of those ugly tubs to the persuasive arguments of 300lb. shot.
Nine or ten months have passed since the proving of the monster gun, and our Government know no more about the power of such guns against the floating batteries than was shown them so long ago by a private mercantile firm at Liverpool. Expertments have been tlied to test the range of the gun, and it has been shown that with half the usual proportion of powder fiom 10 to 50 per cent. more range has been obtained, and with much greater precision of fire than can be obtained from the best ordinary service guns, while it can be as easily trained and worked as any other gun now in use.
The authorities do appear at one time to have felt the expediency of testing the floating batteries
and of provin w ther they7 are reaUy the formidable vessels they have been represented. An order I was issued for the battery Trusty to be taken down I to Shoeburyness and there to be moored at 600 yards' range from a battery of guns, of which it wfas supposed that the monster gun wonid be one. B'ut, after preparing the battery at considerable expense the official courage s,eems to have failed, for, af'ter a valiant declaration fromn some officers and men
that they would stand by the ship the battery was ordered back again and the fittings to be removed.
The recent experiments at Woolwlch for the purpose of testing the power of resistance of timber lined with four-inch iron plates, of the same thickness and strength as the floating batteries, proved that the ordinary service guns would be of but little use against these batteries. Let us not, however, forget the tremendous effects of the monster wrought-iron gun when tried, under the superintendence of a Government officer, against a similar target at Liverpool. The difference in the results ceases to be a matter of surprise when we bear in mind the difference in the weight of a blow from a 681b. and a 3001b.-shot, travelling at a velocity probably exceeding 1,500 feet per second.
I should not forget to mention that after the monster gun was completed and proved at Liverpool, it was intimated to the manufacturers, through an official quarter, that the gun, when received at headquarters, would be further tried d I'outranw-i. e., that this splendid and unique weapon would be wickedly and wilfully burst, or attempted to be burst (for it has been tried at Shoeburyness much beyond the proofs which were pronounced quite satisfactory by the Government officer when at Liverpool), for the purpose of solving the question of how much wrought-iron guns would bear. Against this the manufacturers very properly protested, declaring that the gun was made for the service of the nation, and not with the view of having scientific experiments tried upon it. Shortly afterwards they again proposed in the proper quarter to make, free of all expense, two more guns, not so large as the monster gun, yet as large as any of the largest in the service, for the purpose of their being tried d P'outrance, and of ascertaining what they would bear before bursting. They sought in the proper department for information as to the most useful size and strength to make the guns. In reply they received-the information, and with it the thanks of the paid servants of the nation? Nothing of the kind. They received the cold shoulder, in the shape of an effective hint that their gratuitous services were not agreeable to the powers that be, and that it was not the province of a private firm to initiate any improvements in those departments of Government which are under the benign sway of the Barnacle3.
Therefore, British public be quiet ! Allow the Barnacles their usual inter-Parliamentary slumber, for you may rest content that when the people's representatives again assemble, some one will be found bold enotugh to require a full, true, and particular investigation into the relative merits of monster guns and armour-plated floating batteries.

Sir,-In consequence of an article in TAe Times headed Englishmen in Slavery in China at the Ialand of For. mcsa," I beg to bring under your notice a case that has recently happened in the same island to my ufortunate son, together with six of his crew, who were put on board a Chinese Junk to protect the owner's property, my son being chief offlicer on board a vessel in the same trade as the Kelpie. From the information I have received fromn the firm in China the captain of his vessel purchased a quantity of camphine at Shang-Shoo, and shipped it on board a Chinese junk, which left that port for Hongkong. A gale sprang up immediately, and every soul, together with the vessel, was aopposed to be lost, two days after sailing, on the island of Formosa. On searching after them the natives said that four foreigners had escaped from the wreck, but they would give no further tidings of them.
Should the account of tbe Kelpie prove true, in all probability the other unfortunate persons are also detained in slavery. Allow me, Sir, to implore you to use your powerful aid to induce Her Majesty's Government to order a strict search to be made, so that, if alhve, these unfortunate sufferers may be restored to their liberty and sorrowing relatives and friends.
I remain, Sir, your obedient servant

CENTRAL AMERICA.-At a meeting of the Society
CENTRAL ArE iUCA.-At a meeting of the Society of Arts yesterday, Air. Weguelin in the chair, a paper was read " On Central America, and the proposed Honduras Interoceanic Railway," by Mr. E. G. Sqtuer. The atten. tion of the meeting was first drawn to the pecuharly advantageous geographical position of Central America, which in fact almost realizes the ancient idea of " the centre of the world." Mr. Squier drew attention to the fact that certain points where the continent is most contracted in width are coincident with those where the great mountain chain of the Cordilleras is greatly depressed or entirely interrupted, thus affording facilities for those ways of communication between the oceans which have become among the desiderata of modern times. Ever since the discovery of America by Columbus, " the short and easy passage to the Indies" had been eagerly sought for; but geographical research early demonstrated that to this the American continent presents an unbroken barrier. From that period the daring of man began to contemplate the Titanic enter rise of cutting through the continent, and opening an artificial water communication between the two oceans. But the engineering science of that day was unequal to the task, and forall purposes of rapid comnmunicationthemonarchsof Spain depended upon those roads across the continent which their inability to convert into canals had compelledthemto accept, the principal traffic being across the Isthmus of Panama. As early as the year 1556, however, the insalubrity and other disadvantages of this route led to the presentation of memorials against it to the King of Spain, which led to a complete examination of, and favourable report upon, the Honduras route by Antonelli, the first engineer of that day. Mr. Squier then proceeded to explain that, while occupying the position of diplomatic representative of the U0nitea States in Central America, he was led to the impression of the feasibility of the Honduras route for an interoceanic railway, and some time afterwards, in conjunction with some other gentlemen, he proceeded to a careful examination of the country. It is traversed in various directions by ranges of mountains, radiating from the common base of the Cordilleras, the general course of which is east by south; but after passmg the plain of Otaro, it turns due north, forming the MonteciUas. At the eastern base of the MontecUlas range lies the plain of Comayagus, and from it extending due north is the valley of Humaya, and from it, al3o extending due south, is the valley of the Rio Goascoran, altogether constituting a great transverse vally reaching from sea to sea. It is this plain and its dependent vaLey, constituting anatural cut through the CordiMeras which afford the avenue necessary for the construction of the proposed Hondures Interoceanic Railway. The line of the proposed work commences at Puerto Caballos, on the Bay of Honduras, in lat. 15' 49' N., and long. 87' 57' W., and runs nearly due south across the continent to the Bay of Fonseca, on the Pacific, in lat. 13' 21' N., and long. 870 :35' W. Its total length from anchorage to anchorage is 148 geographical miles, equal to about 161 statute miles. It les wholly in the State of Honduras. The alvantages of the ports at the extremities of the proposed lines were then considered; Puerto Cabaeos
ing described as a good harbour, of great capacity, sufficient depth of water and easy of entrance and exit, while the Bay of Fonseca had been justly spoken of as a constellation of ports. The proposed line does not present any serious engineering difficulties, nowhere involving a gradient of more than GO to 80 feet to the mile. A certain supply of the necessary labour may be depended upon from the local population, and the climateis such that foreign labour may be employed, if desirable. Mr. Squier thentouchad upon the various resources of the country that would be developed by the proposed railway, particularly the silver mines, which are unsurpassed in the amount and richness of their ores. The relative advantages cf a railway and a canal were then discussed, and some interesting statistics of the commerce of the Pacific were given. The saving both of time and distance which this line wouldl afford over the Panama and other routes is considerable, as weU as the advantages that would probably be ultimately afforded for the transmission of intelligence. After spesking of the favourable terms upon wbich the charter had been granted by the Government of Honduras Mr. Squier concluded by congratulating the society upon the probable happy solution of those differences in respect to Central Amenca that have so long disturbed the friendly relations between the United States and GreatBritain. A discussion ensued, in which Mr. Trelawny Saunders and Mr. T. Webster, F.R.S., took part.
BERANGER, THEF POET.-The Journ'al de Bruxelles, an organ of the Church party, announced a few days ago
that the Empress, having heard that Bcranger, the poet, was in receipt of an income insufficient for his wants, had
offered M. Perrotin, his publisher, to add to it from her privy purse a sum large enough to make it 10,OOOf. a-year, provided B6ranger should not know from whom the increase came, bukt should he told that it was caused by an augmnentation of the sale of his works. AL Perrotin, the Jossrnal went on to say, did not think it right to accept the offer without consulting Beranger, and, having obtained Her Miajesty's permission to do so, the poet consented to receive the money, and wrote a handsome letter to Her Majesty, expressing his gratituide for it. The bournsal, in making these statements, refleeted in insulting terms on h .Bd ranger for IIaccepting alms." hi. Perrotini has just addressed a letter to the newspapers, in which he declares that the version of the affair given by the Brussels paper is totally incorrect. It appears, from what be says, that last year the Empress, learning the health and fortune of the poet, proposed to h. Perrotin, through her secretar, lnaer a pron,isO of strict secrecy, to pay into his hands a yearly sum for the benefit of B6ranger, the amount to be fixed by him (M1. Perrotin); but laying down the condition that he should represent the money as coming from himself. M. Perrotin thought that he had no right to enter into such an engagement in B6ranger's name without consulting him, an e asked for an obtained permission so to do. He accordingly communicated to the poet the offer made, which, remnarks X. Perrotin, "was worthy of a noble and truly Royal heart," and B6ranger an reply wrote to hi. Perrotin a letter In which in excelont terms he expressed his profound gratitude for the offer, but said that as he was never richer1tban at that moment, and never had less need of a larger income, he could not accept it.-GalinaZni's Messenger.

Opposition To The Property And Income Tax.
OPPOSITION TO THE PROPERTY AND I IINCOME TAX.
A central meeting for promoting the objects of the Pro. perty and Income-tax Association was held at Exeter-haU last evening, under the presidency of Mr. Alderman Wire. The large hall, with the exception of the gallery, was very weU filUed, and on the platform were Major Reed, MP. (chairman of the association), Mr. Thomas Chambers, MP., Mr. J. Brady, M.P., Mr. Apsley Pellatt, ?LP., Colonel D. M'Dougall, together with deputations from the towns of Birmingham, Barnsley, Brighton, Bridgewater, Deptford, Huddersfield, Ipswich, Oxford, Reading, kc. The attend. ance also included a considerable number of ladies. Letters cf apology for non-attendance, but expressing adhesion to the movement, were received from General Sir De Lacy Evans, M.P., Mr. W. Scholefield, M.P., and. Mr. R Malins, L.P. In opening the business
The C55AIR51.U briefly alluded to the general feeling recently aroused throughout the country on the important subject which had caUed them together. That feeling, however, unless it were earnestly impressed on the members of the Rouse of Commons, would he wholly barren of useful results. Almost everybody now admitted that the income-tax required great modification, and many even went the lengta of demanding its total repeal. Its early history rhowed it to be essentially a war tax, although it was re-introduced by the late Sir R. Peel in time of peace in order to meet a tamporayy deficiency in the nationa. ftnances. When hostilities with Russia first broke out it stood at 7d. in the pound, after which, to meet the war expenditare, it was raised as high as 16fd., the point at whick it now remained. The war beiing now concluded, the country had an undoubted right to the reduction of tho imuost to the peace standard as well as to a thorough revisioh of the present unequai, unjast, and inqusitorial mode of assessment. Moreover, the revenue of the country was in auch a flourishing state that it could easily dispense with the war 9d., and it was therefore to be hope that before Parliament met next month the Chancehor of the Exchequer would aunounce his intention at once to surrender it. (Hear.) Indeed, if it wese true, as Lord Panmure was report to have said, that the estimates would be 20,000,0001. less thiayearthan last year, there wasnoreason why they should not see this obnoxious tax totaRy repealed. When that end was gained there would still be somothing else for the people to ask for. They would have to demand from the Government a revision of our whole system of taxation, so as to subject the rich to at least an equal pressure with the poor. It was well known that at present the industrialclsasespaiduapwards of20per cent. more to the State than the proportion borne by the wealthy and the capitalists. The task set before a new Parliament would be to place all classes, in respect to taxation, upon a footing of perfect equality. To enable them to judge of what had banded the metropolis and the provinces together on that occasion he would briefly enumerate the objects of that association :- Those objects were to obtain the immediate repeal of the acts of Parliament which increased the property and income tax from 7d. to 16d. in the pound, and a more equitable adjustment or a total repeal of the tax upon trades and professions. They would not submit to the fleeting incomne earned by the sweat of a man's brow or the toil of his brain being subjected to the same rate of taxation as the sure and stable income of one who held fixed property in the funds or in land, which he could always leave behind him for the support of his family. (Hear, hear.) It was right to remind them that the additional 9d. in the pound was assented to by Parliament and the country upon the understanding that it was only to continue one year after the terminaston of the war. The peace was concluded and signed on the 30th of March last; consequently the increased tax should cease from April, 1857. The ratifications, however, not having been exchanged until the 27th of April, the Government purposed taking advantage of the wording of the 4th section of the last act, wherein it was provided that it should continue in force until " the 6th of April which shall happen after the expiration of one year from the ratification of peace, and no longer," thus continuing the additional tax unti April, 1SoS. It was hardly to be credited that the country would, upon such a miserable quibble as this, be saddled for a second year after the termination of the war with the fill pressure of the war taxation. If the country only spoke out no Government could have the ispudence to persevere in any such proposaL (" Hear, hear," and a laugh.) At the same time the promoters of that ssociation were of opinion that in any future revision of the impost a direct tax upon reaiszed property ought to constitute a persmanent part of the fmncial system oF this country; and they asked for the co-operation of all classes wrho entertained that view of the subject. (Cheers.)
"That in the opinion Of this meeting the additions madeo tO the Property and Income taX for v,ar purposes ought tO cease frOm the otn of Apris next, aud consequently that the acts of Parliament imposing those additions elsouli be Iemmediately and unconditionaly rvetilsed.'
That association was inaugurated about six weeks since, at the London Tavern, and its first meeting had been followed by a succession of gatherings in some of the largest cities and towns in the kingdom, which could not have failed to have their effect upon the members of Her Majesty's Government. Throughout the country there was but one feeling on this subject-that of unqualified reprobation of any attempt to continue the war tax beyond the 5th of ApTil next, for which there wasno possible pretence. It was monstrous to suppose that the people would suffer themselves to be befooled into a prolongation of the 16d. tax beyond one year after the termination of the war, the period originally fixed by the bargain between their representatives and the Government of the day. (Hlear, hear.) Since the corn-law agitation no other movement had excited so much interest throughout the country as that awakened by this unjust and iniquitous nxpost. The iniquity of applying one scale to precarious end to permanent incomes was too palpable to need proof. Yet he might observe that a careful calculation had been made, from which it appeared that the basiness of a tradesman was worth from two andaa-half to three years' purchase; whereas an income derived from the funds was worth from 28 to 30 years purchase. Sixteen pence in the pound was exacted from the man who earned 1,0001. from a fluctuating trade, which might cease any day from causes beyond his control, while no higher amount was required from the person who had 30,0001. in the Consols and received 1, 0ul. annually in the shape of interest. ("Shame.") Again, the tax was most inquisitorial in its assessment. T e farmers made an outcry against the colection of agricultural statistics, because they would afford their landlords the means of raising their rents. Why should not the same plea protect the tradesman from the inquisition of the Income-tax Commissioners? (Hear, hear.) He was persuaded that the Government would announce to Parliament at the commencemsent of the ensuing session that they were ready to relinquish the war 9d.; but, then, if they did so the work of that association would only be begun (cheers) ; they would only regard that concession as an instalnient of what they had to expect from further agitation. They should not content themselves with one short impulsive effort, and then retire from their labours. They must remember the old Latin maxim, " GmiWa cas4 lapidem, nson vi, sed spe ceadendo." It was only by steadily persevertng m their endeavours that they could succeed in effectually perforating the flinty bosom of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. ("H ear," and laughter.) To secure that end they must also be supported in the House of Commons; and fortunately in that assembly there was a body of independent members-a guerillaband, they were called-who were callous alike to the blandishments of office and to the soothing voice of the Government. (Hear.) The Minister never addressed himself to certain gentlemen behindhim, because be knew they were " all nght." nor did he address himself to those who sat opposite to him, because he knew they were " all wrong ;" those he did address himself to were the independent members, who could not always be reckoned upon by Governments, and who, if they were only aware of their own influence, and exercised it properly, could at any time turn the scale of the House of Commons. (Hear, hear.) For his own part, as one of the independent members of that assembly, unless the declaration came from Ministerial lips that the war 9d. should be given up, and a revision of the injustice done to precarious as compared with fixed incomes was promised, he undertook to put a notice on the books of the Houqe which must either extract from the Government an expression of their readiness to yield to the popular will, or bring down upon them the obloquy which they wvould so richly merit. (Cheers.)
Mr. T. CHA-IBmBs . hLP., in secondin' the resolution, observed that the object of the meeting Zas, not to enter into elaborate details with which they were all already familiar, but to impress on the Government that there was a conviction throughout the country that a grcat injustice was about to be perpetrated, and that the people were determined that that injustice should not be done. (Hear hear.) The cheerful and enthusiastic manner in which the country had borne the burdens of the war entitled it to the alleviation of those burdens at the earliest possible moment. Unluckily, however, when the extra 9d. in the pound was imposed the language of the old statutes passed in thelike case was not strictly folrowed. It was most desirable that that phraseologyshouldhavebenincorporatedin tbenewacts, becauseits meaning had been defined by judicial decisions, at the CoSt of some unhappy litigants. (A laugh.) A deviation from precedent had, however, taken place, whnichone as (agtempted toc believe was3 not altdogether uninmost singular clerical errors ever committed, and it was also he hou~t, amostimpotantpoltical blunder.
-19ad( th ;e taxc, as ja all frmer instances, being made to cease " on the 6th of April
next after the ratification Of Peace," it was miade to continue until "the 6th of A next after the expiration of one year from the ate of the ratification." (" Shame I") Thus the Government got an act of Parliament in their favour. It was undoubtedly their duty to set an example to the rest of the community of perfect obedience to the law (laughter), and sinless the people inistructed them to theo contrary they would be justifie in keeping up this war impost. The people, however, knew how to extricate the Government from their difficulty. (Cheers and laughter.) And this would nrot be the first time that the Brithis Government had been so extricated. One of the brightest Pages of our history 'Was the late uist ansuroghteous war, prosecuted though it was under many difficulties and 3many diacouragements, and wdthout the aid of that supors t from the public departmentswhich the countrybI ad ightto expect. It might well have happeed thatwhen every energy, every resourc
!ndevery noble passion and impulse of thepeoplewas en&tieA in a great and arduous struggle the public might have felt discouragedI at circumstances with which they were all familiar, and of which they were all ashamed; but the country was disheartened by nothing, and the contest was brought to a gacceful issue.

The resolution was then put nd carried unanimonsly.

A rneeting has been held here Mr. J. H. H. Foley, M P for East Worcestershim, in the mbair to petition Parliawnent on the subjeet of the income-tax. There was a large attendance.
Mr. FOLEY in openinv the proceedings, entered into a history of the tax, remarking that its first imposition was part of those great financial measures changing f direct for direct t-axation, relieving the people from the corn lawvs giving them i ntaxedobread to eatr and extending the freead of trade hictm had brorght so enuch proserity to this country of which measures he had been ah huem.6e b.t consistent yUpporter.

what he ought to do when he was better informed of what was going on. He was not in the secrts of the Government, and knewstill less of the intentions of the Oppositicn, but he believed the latter were hard pressed for a " cry." Considering the time of year, the prospects of the trade of th country wvere never in a better or more satisfactory state, judgingfrom the recent rsturns of the revenue and from the extensive orders givet for iron for India in the neigh. bourhood, which wee larger than could be oxecub d.
Mr. HARWARD moved the Srst resolution, denouncing the present income-tax laws as unjust in their application and oppressive in their execution.
Mr. Kxxs seconded the resolution, remarking that while the incomes of poor clerks wore taxed many with larger means escaped. It was only last Saturday that the Chancellor of the Exchequer acknowledged in The Times the receipt of 2001. uncblimed income-tax. This 2001. represented an income of 3,0001. passed over. He thought the commmisioners ought not to be residents.
Mr. WALL proposed the next resolution, adopting a peti-
ti-,n to Parliament and pledging tho meeting to use every means to obtain the total, immediate, and uncondition;
repeal of the tax.
The resolutions were carried unanimously, ana the meeting broke up after passing a vote of thanks to the chairman.

The Health Of London.
TIlE HEALTH OF LONDON.
The following interesting summary of births, deatlhs, and causes of deaths in London, with meteorological observations, for the 15 years 1842-1856, compiled chiefly from the weekly returns, has just been putblished by authority of the Registrar-General-
r1856- Biths .. a Feales 42.674 tTotal 86,833 1856-Deaths Males 28.894 Total 56,786

" In the 52 weeks that ended December 27, the number of ehildren born in london was 86,833. According to arule which holds invariably in this large population, the number of males exceeded that of females, for the births consisted of 44,159 boys and 42,674 girls. In the same period 56,786 persons died-namnely, 28,894 males and 27,892 females. The births increase more or less rapidly with the population; and under a reduced rate of mortality the number of deaths in 1856 was less than that of any previous year since 1852, and the result is an excess greater than was obtained in any former year of births over deaths. This excess is 30,047. Soldiers and seamen have returned from the seat of war, persons engaged in peaceful pursuits have arrived in tho capital from other parts of the inited kingdom and from abroad, and, though many have left it for other homes, it may be assumed that sustenance, clothing, and house accomn modation must now be found in London for about 60,000 inhabitants moro than it contained at the end of 1855.
" Last year the public health was unusually good. During the last 10 years the annual deaths in London have been on the average 25 to 1,000 of the population; in. 1856 the proportion was 22 to 1,000. The mortality was lower than in any year vithin the limits of this comparison; except 1850, when it was slightly less than 21 in 1,000, X. reduction which, it is probable, was partly the consequence of the premature destruction of infirm persons by the cholera of the previous year. That improved state of health which last year prevailed in London as a whole was in various degrees enjoyed by each of the five great divisions of which it is composed. The mortality ranged from 21 in the western and northern divisions to 23Z in the eastern. But without reference to the rate of mortaUty-or the proportion of deaths to populationwhich alone furniehes a criterion of health, a comparison of deaths registered in the several districts wiRl in some cases strikingly indicate the changes always in progress in the component parts of the vast I contiguity' of brick to which the term ' London' is now applied. Westminster, selected for measures of improvement with. some other districts, exhibits a decided decrease in the deaths; while in Kensington, Islington, Lewisham-de. sirable neighbourhoods on the outskirts-the deaths following population show a still more manifest increase.
" The meteorological conditions of the year appear to bave been generally favourable to health. The mean temperature at Greenwich was 4'J*1', which approxi
mates closely to the average as obtained fromalong series of years, Tho winter,-viz., January, February, and
fIarch, was mild; the mean weekly temperature was frequently above 42 deg., and rose as high as 44 deg. and 47 deg.; and in the fifth week of the year the deaths fell to 949. Diarrhoea prevailed among infauts in summer, which to, other classes of the community is the healthiest season * and hence,though the mortality was rather higher in winter than in the other quarterS, i's uniformity throughout the year is remarkable. An exception to this statement must be made with regard to October, which was conspicuous among the months forits low rate of mortality, the weekly deaths having been considerably less than 1,000. The mean temperature during great part of that month was 53 deg. The most fatal period was the first w ek in December, when the deaths rose above 1,300, in consequence of the great rigour combined with sudden change in the state of the atmosphere. 22 inches of rain fell in 1856 - the average of the last 40 years is nearly 26. In the second quarter the rain-fall was in excess of the average. The horizontal movement of the air wvas, on an average, four miles an hour.
"The decline of smallpox in London may be traced through the last seven quarters. In the spring quarter of 1855 the deaths from it were 328 ; thereafter the quarterly numbers were 196, 177, 194, 146, 108, having decreased almost continuously till they were only 74 in the last quarter of 1856. The annual mortality from scarlatina has also been perceptibly less since 1851. If the deaths from this diseaso, as they occurred in four seasons during the last five years, be compared, it will be seen that they always rose rapidly towards the close of each year ; in 1854, when scarlatina. was most fatal, the deaths from it were 3,439, and in the last quarter of that year, 1,297; in 1856 they were 1,795; and in the last quarter 556, having been in each of the previous three quarters about 400. Whooping-cough differs from scarlatina in this respect, that it is almost invariably mnost fatal in the winter quarter, viz., January, February, and March, and (in the next degree) in the spring. The deaths froan whooping-cough were 2,078, showing a decrease on some previous years. Measles alone, of the four epidemics mentioned, exhibits an increase; in 1855 it was fatal in 864 cases, but last year in 1,445.
" The number of persons who died in 116 pub'ic institutions was 10,381. Nearly one person out of five who died in the year closed his days under a roof provided by publ:E law or private charity. In workhouses the deaths of females preponderated over those of males; in hospitals for the sick, lunatic asylums, and prisons, the numbers in relation to sex are inverted, the inmates of the houses last mentioned being chiefly men and boys. The deaths of soldiers and seamen, which during the war rose each year above 400 inL the London military and naval hospitals, were last year 282_
" On the 25th of November the temperature suddenly fell, and, after remaining amid some fluctuations low for the following 10 days, it rose again on December 5, and continued for somc days higher than the mean temperature of the year. The mean temperature of the 10 cold days was 33- deg., and it ranged from 27-7 deg. to 47-6 deg. But the mean.night temperaturewas26-9deg., and therangewasfrom 1904 dog to 35-3 deg. Upon the grass the tbermometer fell one night to 9 5 deg. Fog prevailed for the first four days, hut was afterwards dispelled; on Thursday, December the 4th, rain fell, and an increase of 10 deg. of temperature took place between the hours of 6 p.m. and S p.m., followed by a nocturnal rising temperature, accompanied by a magnetic disturbance. Electricity was positive throughout the period, and volleys of sparks as well as galvanic currents were frequent at first, and became constant during the last five days.
" Although the temperature was not on an average below the freezing point, and the season did not, as in the six weeks ending on February 24, 1855, when the mean temperaturo was 2S-4 deg., exhibit the effects of extreme and protracted cold on the population of London. it was held to be a favourable opportunity for investigating the immediate effects of a faU to a comparatively low temperature foUowed by a mild temperature.
" The deaths at different ages, and of the several diseases in the nosology, were taken out for each day from November the 23d to December the 13th.
" The 10 days (November the 26th to December the 5th) maybe called cold days; the 10 days November the 23d 24th, December the 6th to 13th, may be called warns days. for the sake of distinction.
" The general result is that the deaths in London during 10 cold days were 1,844; while tho deaths in the 10 warm days were 1,50.5. The excess of deaths in the cold days was 339, or nearly 34 daily.
"UXnder 5 yearS of a go the mortality was increased by cold one fonrth part; at the age of o to 10there was no iacrease; at 10 and under 20 the increase was one-third part - at 20-40 one-sixth part; at 40-60 one-fifth part; at 60-84 one-third part. At the age 80 and upwards no effect of cold is shown
"The deaths by consumption were increased at the age 20 and under 60.
" The deaths by lung diseases and heart diseases were increased by the cold; but on the brain diseases the effect is not obvioas."

[A portion of the following appeaed in our second edl. tion of veEterdav:-1
PARIS, TUESDAY, JAN. 20, 6 p.mx.
The Neuchatel question has lost much of its interest from the conviction that it is virtually settled-that a private understanding exists between the Emperor of the French and the King of Prussia to that effect, and that, if diplomatic action be still employed, it is rather to save the amotu propre of the King than anything else. The Confederation having obtained in reality what it required may freely make asacrifice of appearances. It was for some time doubtful where the Conferences would be held, but I hear that London is the place agreed upon. It is fitting that it should be so. Paris has been the seat of two Congresses, and will be that of another when the Danubian Principalities come to be organized. It was in London that the first Congress on Neuchatel was held-it was there that the protocol of the 2tth May, 1852, was signed-and it is there that the queation should be, and probably will be, definitively settled. The Congress will be composed of the resident Ministers of the Darties to the protocol. The only addition will be the6Iinister of theHelvetic Confederation. Switzerland, I believe, has no permoanent diplomatic agent accredited to the Engliah Government, as it has in Paris. I should not be surprised if the Confederation now saw the necessity of having one there as well as here.
The Neuchatcl prisoners have arrived at BesanCon. I understand they have demanded permission to come to Paris on parole until the question be decided, as Paris is a more agreeable residence than the principal town of the Doubs.
The Grand Duke Constantine and the Grand Duchess are expected here about the middle of next month.
The appeal of Verger from the sentence of the Court of Assize was received this day by the Procureur-General at the Court of Cassation. Itwas at once handed over to M.M.Reverchon and Thiercelin, advocates attached to the same Court, whose turn it is this week to examine appeals in criminal cases. It is believed that the Court will pronounce its decision on Thursday.
Verger appeared less dejected yesterday. His father having obtained permission to see him presented himself at 4 o'clock at the Conciergerie, and was admitted. The interview took place in the presence of the director of the prison, and both seemed much affected. The father was the first to speak. " Your business," he said, " has cost me a great deal of trouble. I have had to go about to a great many places for you. So you are condemned to death ?" " Yes," was the reply, " but all is not yet over; I have appealed, and, moreover, I have addressed a petition to the Emperor. No, no; all is not yet over!" They remained for some time together. When the moment came to separate Verger said, in a firm voice,-" My father, be calm, be calm."
At 4 o'clock orders were given for his removal from the Drison of the Conciergerie to that of La Roquette. At half-past 4 a crowd of persons assembled in the court to see the prisoner pass. The door of the Conciergerie in the direction of the court was opened, and a keeper passed carrying under his arm a large bundle containing Verger's clothes. Some minutes after a man appeared: his face was pale and emaciated, and he wore the grayyellow prison dress. It was Verger; he looked dejected and sad, and those who saw the convict at the Court of Assise could scarcely recognize him. He crossed the small interior court without speaking, and moved forward, followed by his keepers, to the old entrance of the Conciergerie. There the prison van was drawn up. He entered the carriage, which concealed him from all eyes, and the vehicle, escorted by Gendarmes, moved off to the prison of La Roquette.
A copy of the indictment was presented to Verger previous to the trial, and he made several corrections in it, and signed it with his initials, " L. V." Among other alterations, he struck out the words setting forth that the exclamation he used on striking the Archbishop was "A Xbas les dgesses !" and insisted that it was "A/ baa les G'Gnovefaims r" (The Genovefains are the chaplains of St. Genevlave.) In another place, where the copying clerk had made the blunder of spelling antel (altar) hotel, Verger corrected the mistake and wrote in the margin "'A 1e" (ass !)
"We are assured," says the Assembl e Natioxtale,
" That the brother of Verger went on Friday to the Conciergerie with an artist, and requested the director of the prison to allow him to have the portrait of the assassin taken. The permission was very properly refused, on which he cried out that sinCe the portrait of the Archbishop was sold everywhere he could not understand why he should be refused permission to sell that of his brother ! "
It is said that M. Ledru Rollin has published an address or manifesto, as it is called, on the snbject of the approaching elections, He deprecates the idea of keeping away from the ballotbox, and declares that if only a single revolutionary candidate be successful it will be something gained. He says nothing, 1 believe, about the oath.
The Monwiter has the following:
" The Prince Imperial has been for the last two days labouring under a slight catarrhal fever. His Imperial Highness was better last evening; there is nothing in his stae to cause any uneasiness."
The iUlness of the child, which was severe for one so young, occasioned much anxiety to the parents, and the Emperor's absence from the Opera last night, where he was expected, is attributed to that cause.
To-morrow on the occasion of the anniversary of the death of Louis XVI., four masses will be celebrated at the Expiatory Chapel in the Rue d'Anjou St. Honore, at 9, 10, 11, and noon.
The Mloxiteur de la Flotte publishes a letter from Manilla, dated the end of November, giving the following details of the late hurricane in the Philippine Islands :
" About the middle of last month we had very heavy gales from the westward, but about the 24th the weather became more calm and the wind veered round to the south. On the 25th there was a completo calm, with particular indi. cations which are weal known to the inhabitants as presag. ing some violent collision of the elements, and considerable uneasiness prevailed. In the morning of the 27th the wind rose suddenly, and went on increadng in violence during the whole of the day, and became at length one of the most terrific hurricanes that had ever been witnessed in the country. Trees were tomn up by the roots, houses carried away, and men and animals in the fields dashed to the ground with terrific violence. All the island of Sunda is literally ravaged, and the town of Manilla only presents the appearance of a heap of ruins; the quays and housee along the banks of the Passig have been blown into the liver; in the capital alone upwards of 5,000 housec have been destroyed. All the archipelago of the Philippines has suffered; Mindanao, Soulou, Palaouan, Ieyta, and Panay have been completely desolated. On the small island of Samar, where there were 300 buildings, not a house or tree now remains-all have been swept away, Boats which had been previously on the shore have been since found several miles inland, and a small river in the southern part of the island has been dried up by the force of the wind. Oa the glacis of the city of ManilLa some guns were blown from their carriages and carried to a distance of more than 100 yards. The number of honses destroyed is immense, far greater than was at first supposed. The loss of vessels on the coast is not yet known, but it must have been very considerable. This hurricane, which lasted altogether about eight hours, exceeded in violence that of 1776, and was felt in all the Philippines at almost the same moment. It has been also felt at Borneo and the Moluccas, and as far as Java, but in a less violent degree."

THE EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA IN LOMBARDY.
(MoM o01 OWN COErEPOWDZNT.)
VIENNA, J3A. 18.
Yesterday afternoon the Stadtholder of Lombardy announced by electric telegraph that the officers belonging to the garrison of Milan, the clergy, and the civil authorities had been permitted to pay their respects to His Majesty on the preceding day. Between the hours of 1 and 2 many ladies of rank were presented to the Empress. In the evening their Majesties went to the Scala Theatre. In the morning of the 17th (yesterday) the Emperor called at the palaces occupied by the Stadtholder and the Central Congregation, and afterwvards inspected various public establishnnents. At 2 o'clock there was a grand parade. " The people give an excellent reception to their Majesties whenever they appear in public." The authorities at Milan did their utmost to secure a good reception for the Emperor, and their exertions have been successful. No great confidence can beplaced in official communications on suchasubject,butthebehaviour of the Milanese must have been perfectly satisfactory, forthe Emperor yesterday informed the Archduchess Sophia by electrictelegraph that the reception given to himself and the Empress was extremely good. According to my informant, who obtained his intelligence at the fountain head, their Majesties were sO well pleased with the Scala and its audience that they remained until the ballet was over, although the Empress was slightly indisposed. For the information of persons who are curious in such matters, it may be stated that the opera given was 1n Trovatore and the balet Manon Lescaut. Prineo Thurn and Taxis, whose illness was announced about a fortnght since, is dead. Thae complaint of which t ran Steward of tle Empress died was typhus fever, brought on, it is said, by his having remained too long in the cold, damp churches of Venice. We bave not yet received any detailed account of the festivities which are to take place during the short sojourn of their Majesties at Milan, but it is known that several of the great Lombard nobles intend to give fetes in their honour. The Duke Giulio de Melzi, who has a magnificent palace at Milan, gives a grand ball on the 24th instant, at which their Majesties wiU be present. It is probable that the illustrious travellers will go to Florence at the end of this month, and pass a week there, but no positive information has yet reached me on the subject. It is stiU stated that the Emperor wiU meet the Pope at Loretto, and it is not unlikely that such will be the case, as so celebrated a shrine must have an irresistible attraction for so dutiful a son of the Church as His Majesty. The Augsbutrg Gazte has received some interesting and evidently authentic information from Milan relative to the sequestrated property of the emigrants. Not only will every description of property be returned to the rightful owners, but also all the revenues and interest of the same. That the emigrants may have no cause whatever to complain, Hlis Majesty has also ordered that the outlay for the management of the property during the absence of the ownerswhich amounts to 560,00e, silver florins-shall be paid by the State. It has been said in some of the
foreign papers that ladies belonging to good families I are still imprisoned for political offences, but the statement is incorrect. One woman was in prison, and her name was contained in the list of 70 persons who were pardoned by the Emperor on the 2d of December, 1856. The conspiracy at Mantua, of which mention was made in a letter written about a week since, was discovered towards the end of 1852, and the plan was " to bring about a general insurrection, and to make an attempt on the life of Hi, Majesty." The persons who were charged to examine into the insurrection which took place at Milan on the 6th of February, 1853, were of opinion that the disturbers of the public peace had no regular plan of action, and no exactly defined political object in view. They got up a " row," and endeavoured to take the authorities by surprise, but failed in the attempt. After the amnesty had been granted at Venice there were 44 political offenders left in the prisons of Lombardy and Venice, but 32 of them have since been pardoned. There are still, however, many persons confined in the prisons and fortresses of the other &ustrian provinces, who were tried and condemned for political offences committed in Lombardy and Venice.
So much has been said and written about the possibility of the march of a Russian army to Herat, and thence to British India, that some correct information, which is extracted from two long articles on the subject that have appeared inthe Geazbote, may be of service to theBritish public:-"lThe road from Astrabad (at the southern end of the Casplian) to Herat, which is 265 hours long," runs through a part of the province of Ehorassan, where there is neither wood nor water. The direct road from Elerat to Cabul is about 120 hours' long, and it is very doubtful whether an army would be able to convey artillery along it. " There are so many wastes, gorges, and passes between Herat and Cabul that an a;rmy with baggage train would hardly be able to accomplish the jomrney in less than two months. If an armywould avoid the above-mentioned difficulties it must go by the King's road, which leads to Candahar. As the distance is 130 hours, it might perhaps be marched by an army in six weeks. Tbe distance from Cabul, by way of Peshawur, to the Tndus is 95 hours. The road from Cabul to Peshawur runs for 60 hours through an unfruitful mountainous country." The author of the articles in the Grenizbote, who is evidently master of his subject, is of opinion that a Russian campaign against India would occupy two years. The first year would be spent in getting from the Volga to Herat, and the second in marching from Herat to the Indus. The German strategist also speaks of sundry impediments with vwhich the Russians might chance to meet during their march, but they need no mention, as they must present themselves to the mind of every Englishman.
The Cardinal Archbishops of Prague and Olmiltz are gone with thePrince-Bishop of Breslauto Berlin, in order, if possible, to make some arrangement relative to their respective sees. The Breslau diocese extends from the Baltic far into Austrian Silesla, and the sees of the two Austrian Archbishops comprise in them a part of the Prussian territory.
The first general assembly of the Credit Bank will be held on the 2d of March. The want of "buoyancy" on 'Change Is as great as ever.
PRUSSIA.
(moM OUR OWN COMMSPONDMT.)
BERLIN, JAx. 19.
Yesterday evening, although Sunday, the Staats Anzeeiser published a number containing a list of the names of all who had that day received an Order, together with a short account of the ceremonies connected with the Ordensfesst. Though the list contains the names of upwards of 800 persons made happy and more loyal than ever on this occasion, there is only one among them that will have any interest for your readers. Of the account of the proceedings, however, I may as well give you a few details. Of these 800 favoured psrsons it must not be supposed that all have received high and valuable Orders ; that would hardly be true of a fifth or dxth part of them; the rest have had allotted to them the lower classes of the less distinguished Orders, chiefly as a distinction for exemplary civil service-in the same wholesale way as after the Crimean campaign medals and clasps were distributed for military service.
Among the names of the four noblemen who re-
ceivedt the investiture of the Order of the Blank Eagle on this occasion is that of Baron von Manteuffel; the Order itself was, however, conferred on him last March on occasion of the Treaty of Peace being concluded at Paris, and the additional distinction conferred on him yesterday appears to have consisted in the chain or collar of the Order, and probably formned the expression of his Royal Master's great satisfaction at the pacific conclusion of theNeuch-tel diffliculty, for the only complication which in any degree endanogered the preservation of peace was the detention an the threatened trial of the Royalist prisoners. Last March Baron von Manteuffel, in Paris, informed His Majesty that the labours of theConferene ehad arrived at a satisfactory termination as regarded their agreeing to a draught for the Treaty of Peace, which was to be signed in due form in a few days; hereupon the King determinedl to confer on him this, the highest Order in Prussia; and that the latter might be enabled to wear it on the occasion of the solemn signing of the document the insignia were sent off to him without delay by a special courier; -and furthermore, with the intention that his newhonour nmight be duly mentioned with his other titles and idignities in the preamble of the treaty, the agreeble
intelligence was forwarded to him at osic by telegraph. The courier arrived in admirable timnewlththe mnsignia, but the telegraphic despatch, though so much more rapid in its passage, came too late tot i
purpose-the preamble had been metallographed many days in advance; and thus, in spite of the King's goodwill and intentions towards his Minister, posterity will probably remain ignorant of the highly interesting fact, that the representativa of Prussia at the Paris Conferences vwas at that tim, in possession of the Order of the Black Eagle.
The ceremonies of the Ordensfest appear, according to the Staats Anzeiger, to have been pretty much as follows :-While the King was holding a chap tec of the Order of the Black Eagle, and conferring the investiture on four knights lately admitted, such gentlemen as had received orders during the past year, but had not yet been presented, assembled in another apartment, and in a third the General Committee of Orders was distributing the various medals, clasp3, ribands, &c., to their seven or eight hundred recipients. At the conclusion of the chapter of the Order of the Black Eagle the King repaired to the apartment where those who had been dgcorEs since the last Ordensfest wero in waiting, and who were then presented to him singly by the members of the General Conmittee of Orders. The manner in which this takes place here is the same as at the levees in St. James's Palace. Thence the King proceeded to the the Ritter Saal, or Hall of Knights, where he and the Queen took their seats on their dais, with the Princes and Princesses of the Royal family and various members of Imperial and Royal houses standing on their right; and the Ministers of State the King's adjutants, and the Knights of the arder of the Black Eagle ranged on their left. The President of the Committee of Orders then presented to the King and Queen all the newly nominated knights of the different orders in the presence of the whole Court, so that, if the former act of presentation resembled a levee, this second act seems to have close affinity with the holding of a drawingroom. At the conclusion of this portion of the day's ceremonies the whole Court and the newlymade knights proceeded to the Royal Chapel, where there was already assembled a considerable number of persons in possession of Prussian orders, and who had received invitations to attend. After Divine service was over the whole party assembled in the chapel returned to dinner in the Palace, which was served in a variety of apartments, and then came together again in the Hall of Knights, where what is called cotr was held while coffee was served round. Cour consists simply of a large party of well-dressed ladies and gentlemen, composing the greater part of the Court, meeting together at the invitation of the King, and among whom the King and Queen and Royal family move about at their ease, talking familiarly with any such members of the company assembled as they may happen to be interested in at the moment. The cour formed the conclusion of the day's entertainments, for at Court, as well as in private life here, it is usual, although the dinner hour is an early one (the King dines at 3 o'clock), for the party to break up almost immediately after coffee has been served, an arrangement which admits of dress being changed and the theatre or a ball being visited the same evening.
If the above has been of interest to any of your readers who may not be familiar with the habits of a foreign Court, perhaps a little information on th 1 subject of the different orders established in Prussia may not be unacceptable apropos of this subject of the Ordea.sfest.
1. The highest and most distinguished order in Prussia is that of the Black Eagle, which is conferred only on Princes of the blood, foreign personages of similax rank, and men who have meritoriously served the State in the highest grades of either the civil or military service. It has only one class, but of late years the collar, which formerly formed part of the insignia, has been reserved as a special distinction, while a mounting of brilliants, which does not form necessarily a portion of the insignia, is the most flattering form in which it can be conferred. The order was founded by the Elector Frederic III. of Brandenburg, January 18, 1701, the same day on which he crowned himself King in Prussia. On the anniversary of that day a chapter of the order is always held inthe Royal Palace, but the general Ordensfest, which is celebrated as the anniversary of the erection of the present monarchy of Prussia into a kingdom, is always held on the first Sunday after the 18th of January, if that day should not happen to fall on the first day of the week. The insignia consist of a broad band of rich, watered, orange-coloured silk passing round the body from the left shoulder to the right hip, where a rosette of the riband supports a large blue enamelled cross set in gold, the four arms of which are cleft at the extremities ;I a rouand escocheon in gold, bearing the initials " F. R." (Fredericus Rex), is planted on the centre of the cross, while each of the four arms bears a black eagle with a golden crown. In addition to the broad band there is also a silver star of eight rays, with the black eagle in the centre, surrounded by the motto, "'Suum cuique," to be worn on the left breast.
2. The Order of the RedEagle is conferred on distinguished military and civil servantB of the State, and consists of four different classes, of which the firsthas five, the secondl 10, the third five, and fourth two different grades. The insignia of the first class consist of a white riband with an orange border, worn as described above, supporting a cross with a red eagle on each of its arms, and with the legend "sincere et constanter" round it; the escccheon on the centre of the cross bears the initials " F. W.," after Friedrich Wilhelm II., who adopted this (originally Bayreath) order on the occasion of the union of the House of Bayreuth with the Prusso-Brandenburg line; in the second class the cross is worn round the neck suspended by a riband; while in the third and fcurth classes there is nothing but a bit of o:range riband in the buttonhole to show for it. Tho five gradations of the first class consist of all the changes that can be rung upon oak leaves, crown and rceptre, oak leaves and g]aives, or oak leaves, as the only addition to the red eagle. The ten grades of the second class comprise all the combinations that can possibly be made out of star, oak leaves, crown, sceptre, glaives, ann rings, any, all, or none of them being associated withth red eagle; the five grades of the third class show what can be made out of the combinations of a flowing knot, glaives, and rings; while the two gradations of the fourth class consist only of glaives or no glaives.
3. The order pour le m6rite was founded by Frederic the Great in 1740, originaLly for the rewarding of distinguished military services, but of late years it has received, in addition to the military, also a civil class. This decoration consists of a golden cross of blue enamel with cleft ends, the upper arm of which bears an "F," with a Royal crown, the other three the words "pour le merite," while the inner an-les of the cross contain golden spread eagles. T}is is the military class, and it has three gradations-with a crown, vith oak leaves, and without either; the civil class has for its decoration a golden cross with a circular central escocheon.
Then comes 4, the Johanniter Orden, or the Order of the Knights Hospitallers, founded in 1812 in the place of the Balley Brandenburg of the Johanniter Orden, which was dissolved at the time of the secularization of all religious housm throughout the kingdom in 1810. B3y a new statute recently issued by the present King this order is made to be subservient to the erection and maintenance of hospitals or other institutions for the care of the Bick and wounded; the essentis for admission to
u'is rur- wnc nvMe acnierbecotiu
tlus rder, whichninvolves a conaiderable contribution in money, are German descent, noble birth, and the profession of the Evangelical (Protestant) faith.
5. The Hohenzollern Order -was founded by the present King on the occasion of the union of the Principality of Hohenzollern, the birthplace of his ancestors, with the kingdom of Prussia. It has three grades of the cros class and three grades of the eagle class. It is conferred in recompense of particular fidelity and loyalty to the present reigning family.
6. The Order of Louisa, which was originally destined for females who distinguished themselves by their devotion to the sick and wounded during the Warof Liberation, was reorganized in 1850, with the view of extending it to those who had rendered similar Eervices in 1848 and 1849. It takes its name from the late much loved Queen Louisa, and consists of a golden cross, enamelled in black, bearing a blue lozenge on the centre, in the middle of which on the front side stands an " L," surrounded by a circlet of stars, and the dates 1813 and 1814 bebind; the cross is worn on the leftbreast, attached to a wbite riband Wvith a black border.
7. -The AUgemeines Ehrenrerichen, or general token of honour, is a silver medal, with the legend " Deserved well of the State" on the obverse, and
the King's cipher on the reverse, suspended by a niband from the buttonhole.
8. Tbe token of honour and merit for savii g human life was founded in 1833, and consists of a silver medal worn with orwithouti riband. It bears
the effigy of the King, with the legend " For xaving human life" (Fur Rettung aus Gefahr).
In addition to these, which are conferred on both military and civil persons, are the three following exclusively military orders:-
9. The Orderof tle Iron Cross, founded in 1813, and conferredonlyon persons who distinguishedthemselves by bravery in the presence of the enemy during the War of Liberation. The few civilians who have received this decoration wear it with a white riband. The grand crosses of this order are already extinct by the death of aU their holders; and even those of the first class are also nearly extinct.
10. The military token of honour has two classes, for sub-officers and privates, consisting of gold and silver medals.
11. The token of distinction for exemplary service, founded in 1825, for officers who have been 25 years in active service, consists of a golden cross, with the cipher of the King, and the number XXV. suspended by a blue riband.
12. The clasp for exemplary service, founded at the same time, is conferred on sub-officers and privates, whicb, according to its three classes, is apportioned to those who have served 21, 15, or nine years respectively.
13. The Neuch&tel medal was struck in 1832, and distributed to those NeuchMtelais who took part in the military operations ag,ainst the rebels there in 1831.
14. The token of distinction for faithful and conscientious duty in the Landwehr, founded in 1842.
With none of these decorations or honourable testimonials are any pensions or other pecuniary emolumentconnected; ontheotherhand, it is onlytbe Order of the Black Eaggle and that of the Knights HospitaUers that put the ripients to any expense, but aUthe insignia together cost the State no more than 12,000 thalers (l,800l.) a-year; the total cost of the whole administration of the institution amounts, however, to 25,650 thalers (3,8481.) With this paltry sum of money spent in ribands, crosses, and stars, it is found possible to offer an object of emulation to above 500,000 men in the military and 51,937 employs in the civil service, to make up to them for wretchedly poor pay and tediously slow promotion; and, in a word, to confer some attraction on the otherwise unsatisfactory pastime, "travailler pour It roi de Prusse."
THE ELBE.
(FROM OUR OWrE CORRnSPONDENr.)
HAMBIURG, JAYr. 19.
The most important information that can be commumicated hence for the information of those trading with this city is that the navigation of the Elbe may, in all probability, become free for steamers to safely reach the port in the course of three or four days'time. The weather, which had been very mild during the better part of the past week, has turned into a strong thaw and light rain since yesterday afternoon, and the ice has already begun to break up into floating masses.
One iron-built screw vessel, belonging to Hamburg, by means of great attention and corresponding exertions on the part of the owners -the Planet, Captain Schade-managed, to the great astonishment of our merchants, and with but little damage to her screw, to reach the harbour on the 16th inst. by forcing through the weakened ice-a great triumph over other vessels, none of which have attempted to follow her example. The sam,ne captain performued a similar feat last year with equal success. The reason why some of our Eng,lish captains do not attempt the like may be probably better known to, the shipbrokers here than to themselves oF their owners; as there certainly are among them seamen capable of a similar feat when properly informed of the state of the ice. Thebrokerof the Planet personaly examinedthestate of the ice in the river, and finding a possibility of the ship's forcing her way through, with the aid of ice boats,! telegraphed to Cuxhaven to Captain Schade to come up, and the operation was successfully performecd, in preference to allowing the ship and cargo to remain at either Cuxhaven or Glilckstadt, to be exorbitantly plucked by the intermediate agents employed between this place and those ports. A trifling damage done to a ship even by forcing her way through the ice cannot be compared to the amount of extra cost of ship and cargo while having to remain at the points in question.
SARDINIA.
A letter from Turin of the 17th inst. informs us that the speech of Count Cavour, in the Chamber of Deputies of Turin on the 15th inst., in reply to the Radical deputy Brofferio, was one of the most successful Parliamentary discourses ever heard in that house. Count Cavour skilfully took advantage of the opportunity afforded him by his opponent to trace the well marked line which separates the policy of the King's Government from that of the revolutionary party. The Prime Minister spoke in clear and distinct language, and wiith that energetic accent which is the characteristic of aincerity. He added, that in making his profession of political faith he was actuated not only by the consideration of his duty as a Minister of the Crown, but likewise by that of the honour and interests of Italy. The applause wlith which his speech was greeted proved to Count Cavour that while he expressedagreat trath, he was at the same time a faithful expositor of public opinion. The Sardinian Plenipotentiaries demonstrated at the Congress of Paris that the Piedmontese policy is the only one to preserve Italy from the triumph of the revolutionary party. The language and the opinions expressed byCount Cavourfrom the tribune were precisely those enounced by him at the Congress of Paris; his speech, consequently, has a political bearig, which was not lost on his audience. Count Mamiani likewise delivered a very eloquent speech, which was greatly applauded, in which he enumerated, with great perspicuity, the practical results already obtained during the eight months which have elapsed since the European Powers officiaUy proclaimed that the Italian question is a question of order and of peace. Count AIamiani's speech is regarded as one of the most briliant Parliamentary orations delivered since the establishment of a constitutional government in Italy. It wvas both logical and eloquent. The opinions of theaiberal partythroughout Italy could not have beenmore skilfully elucidated.
SWITZERLAWD.
The following is the Order of the Day published by General Dufour Z-
, Head-quaters, Zurich, Jan. 17.
The Generalof theFederal Army requests the divisional commanders to announce to their troops that the Legislative Councils of the Confederation have adopted, by a great majority, in their sittings of the 15th and 16th, the propositions of the Federal Council tending to arrange the affair of Neeucbatel in a pacific manner, but without entailing projudice to the dignity and honour of Switzerland. He expres:es to the soldiers of all ranks his high satisfaction at the promptitude with which they responded to the call of their country when its independence was menaced, as well as at their conduct under arms. They will continue to prove in future, by their discipline, conduct, and respect for the measures taken by the supreme authorities of the country, that they merit the sympathy shown them in all quarters. The General, in concert with the cbiefs of the Federal Army, will do all in his power to relieve the position of the troops as far as it is compatible with the requirements of the service. He is
aware of all that they have to suffer in winter quarters, but he is also aware that it is by a pAient support of privations tL.at good soldiers are shown. It was as much by their devotion in supporting the rigours of a long winter as by their battles and victories that the soldiers of the Crimea ac:uired that halo of glory and gratitude which accompanies them everywhere.

I LAW BEPOBT.
I COURT OF CHANCERY. LUxCOLT'R.Th-NI -T,- 91
CA3kPBELL V. CORLIWy.
(Before the ouDs JusTcEs of APPE'A1)
Tbe case for the plaintiff in this guit was closed on Tees. day, late in the dlay, when the counsel for the defendant commenced his opening address. It was deemed, however, more convenient to deter a report of it until to-day, in order that the defence might appear in a more connected form.
Mr. DANIrz said he appeared for Mr. Corley, to vwhom badl been attributed the miost base and improper motives in the course he had pursed. The other side had been of necessity driven to assert that Mr. Corley had been guilty of insisting upon his marital rights, although those rights had, upon the materials before the Court, been interfered with by a contraLct between him anid his dec~eased wife before their marriage. To that length hadl the other side been driven. Strange as was the romance of real life which the present case disclosed, the learned counsel hoped to satisfy
thir Lordahips that as early as 1851, before the aggrava. tions and complications of the litigation had arisen- at a time when Mr. Corley was believed to be no better than an impostor in endeavouring to establish a title by marriagea, title founded on fraud and deception-at that 'verytime he should prove that Mir. Corley was actuated by nomrcenary imotives, but, on the contrary, that he had offered Mr. Campbell, by whom he had Eince been so relentlessly persecutxed, that if he would mar57y a lady of respectability he (Mir. Corley) would settle upon him and on the issue of the marriage the whole of the mother's property. That did not seem mercenary ont the par; of JMr. Corley. M1r. Campbell, acting upon the supposition, which perhaps he at this very mnoment believed, that no valid marriage had ever been contracted by his mother, refused the offer. Considering that Mrs Corley, formerly Mrs. Constantia campbeA died six Years ago-namely, on the 11th of Januayy, 1851, and that it was only in 1856, on the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, by which Mr. Campbell's petition -o appeal had been dismissed with costs, Mri. Corley lad succeeded in establishing the fact of the marriage, on evidence In existence at the datte of the commencement of the litigation, it was no wonder that Mr. Corley's case should be such as to render it necessary for his counsel to enter into a statement of details from the disclosure of which he (the learned counsel) would have been but too glad to have escaped. It had, however, beowme nocossay to trouble their Lordships with a, detail of the evidence and correspondence in order that the Court might understand the relation in which the parties stood towards each other. The learned counsel could well have wished that mastters of a most painful nature could have been avoided. He could sincerely have desired that the narration of circumstances the detail of which could only expses the name of a venerable and vir. tuous Lady to laughter in a court of justice had been spared. It would have been the duty as well of Mr. Corley as of Mr. Camnpbell to hide fromi view, if it had been possible, the weakness and frailty of one who was the wife of one and mother of the other, but the conduct of Mr. Came
belin this litigation rendered such a course on Mr. Corle?s potimpossible. It had not been possible for Mr. Corley to
uue any other course than he had, and it was not his mutthat the painful investigations which had taken place hdbeen entered upon, or that the unseemly disclosures had been made. He (Mfr. Daniel) would commence his oh. servations with referring to the cross-examination of Mr.
Corey in which he disclosed his personal position. He said hewas bern in reland, of Irisk Roman Cathlc aentr, but became a Protestant upon conviction, he havn been originally brought up in the religion ofhi
parents. -This took place when he was about 34 Years of ge.Re as aled to the har in Dubli in 1823 or 1824.- During his father's life kee was allowed 3001. a-year, and after his death he beccame Possessed of 6001. a-year. In 1832 he married, in St. James's Church, Piccadilly, and his wife died in 1837 or 183. He had settled 5001. a-year of her own property on his wife, and had still a life interest in her fortune. He was 34 YearsOf age inx 1830. Such was his
rsonal history so disclosedl. It was to be observed that £1r. Corley, thoug by rank a barrister at beth the Irish aInd the English bar, never practised, and therefore many of the observations which had ben made upon him had no application beyond mere form Mr. Corley's wants were mederate, and his men iht be represented as ample. His introduction to the Capbel family was not, as had been alleged, the result of a casual interview with the mother at a table d'h6te at Paris, in 1845, but, as stated in the 8th paragrph of his answer, was at a _party in that city at the apartments of mautual friends, and he afterwards met her at a table d'hflte ; and afterwards he renewedl his acquaintance writh her on her return to London, where he visited her in Cumberland-street, on her ownx invitation, and was received and treated by her as an intimate friend, and was often con. sulted by her upon domestic and personal affairs. He (Mr. DaLniel) was not aware of any circumstances which the most jaundicedl mind could interpret into what might be called eltufthunting" on the part of Mir. Corley in his intercourse with the lady. Mrs. Constantia CamPbell sought the &aquaintance of Mr. Corley, and not he hers. 'he was the widow of an officer, and had sufficient income; she had a eonl, who was the object of her unbounded and, notwithstanding his irregularities, of her undiminished affection, and her position was such that it couald not by possibility suggest to Mir. Corley the policy of ingratiating himself into her favour. it was in 146 anid 1847 that the material circumstances arose which the learned counsel would, if in justice to Mr. Corley he could, abstain from laying before the Court. That, howrever, was impossible. Those circustancesypreduced a blight uponL and a canker i the minddof the lady, and induced her to seek in the acquaintance of, sand afterwards in the mUanria" with, Mir. Corley a restraint upon her son wh0c" might at once protect him, and ultimately work a reforms. tion in his behaviour. Ther was nothing in the evidence to show that at this time Mr. Corley had the ilightest means of knowing of her soness misconduct. Xrs Rleade, who had been when Beatrice CruLmp Mrs Camap. bell's lady's-maid from 1828 to 1851, In her cross-exaiation de-scribed Mr. Campbell's conduct as such as in any walk of life could not but be regarded as the gressest out rage a man could commit against any woman, and the mere so when that woman was his mother. She said, "At one time Mr. Campbell introduced to hids mothersa porson as his wife who was not his wife. She thought it was in 1847. For about two days Mrs. Campbell associated with that person. Mrs. Campbell told her, after twvo days, that she had discovered that that person was not her son's wife, and, though she was very much hurt, she said,sewsga the was not her son's wife." The whole crepnec
provedI that the ladY Was a person of getcatt n mnorality, and viewed such a am as that in wihhrsn her own flesh and blood-was living as an abomination, and as abhorrnt to her feelings of religion as; if that sin were committed b& herself. This son, knowig that such were his mnother's feeligs, didathis most disgraceful act, Some excuse had been attempted to be made for him. As an infant he had been left to her widowed charge when he was only siLx years old, she had rtared him through boyhood to mianhood, and as child, man, and boy he had known her feelings and therefore the profligacy of a mesa-room was no excuse for the commission of such an outrage upon her, and he must well have known the painful effect ofhi conduct uxpon her. Robert Pease, a servant of the lady, in his evidence said that Mr. Campbell did niot behave in a proper mianner towards his mnother. He had heard him call her fool, beast, and liar, and that in his (Pease's) presence her son had threatened to strike hor, and had thrown two, illinot three, pails of water over her, and committed other gross acts of violence to his aged and indulgent mother. He also deposed that the woman Mrx. Cam pbell had introduced as his wife went out upon visits with al Cmpbell in her carriage, and when it was discovered Mrs.Campbell expressed he annoyance at hsvingbeenAintroduced to a "had woman." Mr. Campbell also caused the larder and dairy to be locked up, and his mother's carriage to be locked up in his harn, and she took a wkeel off to prevent her using it, and, independently of this, MEr. Cam pbl rt letter, commanding that his mother should be subjected to such annoy ing privations, and addressed that letter "To the constble and all concerned." Such was the brutal conduct which induced the mother to endeavour to set UP the rights of ahusband as abar to a repetition of it In a letter to Mr. Corley Mrs. Campbell wrote:-" I know not what to do hut under your guidance. Can nothing be done with this infamous woman!? I know plent'y of places wherle she is over head and ears in debt, and where ' swindler' is added to the worst word in the English language to women. Alexander is most pitiable. I kniow not how to address him with any sautary effect, he has deceived me so much, and, in truth, mny only reliance is on your kindness to him. I crave your commisel-ation for him anid the benefit of your society. . . . The more this wretched woman want-s money the better, and be assured she is at thisl moment le-agued with the man of stocks te extort it from wh.t remaLins of myunfortunate3son's means. The women of
o.1,the inmate of the pariour, the rejptile above (for that is the name given her by many) are allin league; her psaramiours are countless-Pa&rker is maintained behind the scenes, and wvll all this not operate with the sad being so debased by such associations,Can on, will you, my dear Sir, save him? and I pray the Almighty that you masy have the pwer." All this was plain to prove that up to January, 1848, Mr. coriey could have nothing to do with the change of mrs Campbell's feeling towards her son, for her letter of that date showed that she counted on his influence to effect a reformation, as her firs appeal was fer advice to Mr. Campbell and of assistance to his mother in her extremity of distress at his meet debased conduct. Again, on the 12th of januakry, she wrote, "1It is with difficulty I can collect MY ideas; if1I am wrong, I ]mow and feelvour indulgence and, Iniaysay, mercY to me. Iknow not if I ought to ;wrte to
sn~port. Thse ad mny mre ettes sowled thatvthe.lady
as to bring Mr. Campbell within tho gentle inflnence of his mother's care and affection ; and, indeed, from two letters that passed between the two gentlemen, they seemed for a time to have been on friendly, if not on confidential terms, and, indeed, so confidental were the terms they were on that Mr. Campbell, in giving instructions for his will, directed that Mr. Corley should be named as a trustee and have a legacy of 5001 which showed that the mother had Isucceeded in her wiRh; and it further showed that Mr. Corley's conduct had been dictated by only disinterested motives. As regarded the feelings with which the mother wvasactuated towards her son, all the witnesses who had
been examined emphatically declared that they were of the most affeotionate description. On the whole correspondence it was clear that, notwithstanding the frequent outrages on her feelings inflicted by the immoral conduct of hes son, sho never in a single instance exhibited vindictiveness towards him, but, on the contrary, behaved like a kindhearted and forgiving mother, and entertained for him the most donting aflection. The object Mrs. CampbeU had in contracting msaatrimony was that her son should not be entitled to the money, unless from the I gratuitous bounty of ber husband, which she believed would be exercised towards him if tho reformation in his behaviour took place which she so fondly and even religiously hoped. That Mrs. Campbell desied to keep her marriage secret for a time was clear, and that iks disclo3ura to her son, never took place ws attributable to the death, sudden at lost, although at a great age, of this lady. That
abe herself desired the marriage to be solemnized no doubt could upon the correspondence b3 entertainel, and she balieved that by so doing the should obtain for her son a safe and efficient protector, who would fulfl her wishea and bestow upon Mr. Campbell such part of her property a, his amended conduct might show that he deserved.
Lord Justice KMGRT BRUCE observed that anY man of ordinary intelligence, though not a oaer, as Mr. Corley was, could have told the old lady that witoUt inVestlng aiM with the character of a husband she could byWill have given him all her roprty, to deal with as in his discreU
e should see fit, for the benefit of her son. The question was, why did ehe desire to marry Mr. Corley at all?
Mr. DANiErr said he had already given an answer to the question, and as to the observation he must remark that the lady had, as she had an undoubted right to do, placed Mr. Corley in the situation of a protector of her son. He admitted that it was difficult to arrive at any satisfactory con. clusion upon Mrs. Campbell's conduct on any other theory; and no one ventared to say that she was not a pure minded and conscientious, and, moreover, a scrupulously religious womnan.
Lord Justice KNIGxHT BRUCE.-The question Isr-ad it is a question which must at some time before this case is over be answered--was Mr. Corley Mrs. Campbell's adviser in this matter? And if he were, was it or was it not his duty to say to this lady, " Madam, you may die and not make what the lawyers call an appointment by your will, and if so I shall become the entire owner of your property ?' and to inquire, "Do you so intend, or do you intend that your property shal go among your relations?" Did he azk that?
Mr. DAwrEs. said the correspondence showed that she ased him to take upon himself the relationship of husband which would impose uTon himna duty and arik-, and to this he objected unless he had property of hers to answer it, and to this she seemed to have in effect rejoined that she woulId have a life interest. Such was the ineaning' the many expressions in her letters, which had been so much enlarged upon. The learned counsel then entered into a minute detail of the correspondence, and coPiously commented upon the principal lettters, and insisted that there was no contract which coud be founded upon the letters of 18BO, or if there were that it was only to the effect that mrs. Campbell should have a life interest to her separate use, and in no way inter. fered with the marital right.
Mr. SoUTHsGAT, on the same side, again referred to parts of the evidence, and made a few forcible observations.
At about 2 o'clock Mr. WiaGnx stated that Mrs. Reade (nee Crnmp) had been in court all day to give any explanation she could of the contents of the boxes in Mr. PouIden's
ssession, and perhaps their Lordships would discharge he.r from furher aLttendance after the boxes had been opened. A discussion ensued whether the boxes should now be opened, and ultimately it was directed that they s-hould be placed in the joint custodU f the solicitors, Mr. Church and Mr. Jacquet, and Ms. eade ws not required to remain.
Mr. Wigram has still to be heard in reply.

(Before Vice-ChanetZor Sir R. T- KT n- -
Mr. ELLLS moved in this case, by special leave of the Court, that a fit and proper person, other than the defendant, might be appointed guardian of the infant plaintiff, and that the defendant might be restrained from interfering with the education of the plaintiff and further proceeding under the writ of habeas coapus granted by the Court of Queen's Bench, or from acting upon axy order made there. upon. The circumstances were these :-The plaintiff's father, who was a sergeant of Marines, was killed at the battle of Petropaulovsld in September, 1854, leaving the plaintiff and a son surviving. The plaintiff was baptized and brought up as a Protestant, which faith her fatler professed, went to a Protestant school, and the defendant, after her husband's death, and in compliance with his request, continued to train up the plaintiff as a Protestant. The son was placed at a Protestant school in Hampshire by the commissioners of the Patriotic Fund, and the plaintiff at the Sailors' Orphan School in July, 1855. Subsequently the defendant removed the son from the school in Hampshire with his own consent, and applied to remove the plaintiff also in October last, intending, as was alleged, to educate them as Roman Catholics, in consequence of which the present application was made.
Mr. Haddan appeared for other parties.
Mr. FLDCNG appeared to oppose the motion, and asked for time to answer the affidavits, offering, on behalf of the defendant and Mlr. Ward, her solicitor, to undertake that the plaintiff should not be taken out of the jurisdiction of the Court, and should be produced to his Honour whenever he should require it, and to abide by any order the Court might think fit to make.
The VIcEr-CslUCELLOx said that much more was asked for on the motion than could at present be granted. The defendant would understand that any violation of the undertaking would have the same effect as if she was under an injunction. There must be time to answer the affidavits.
The motion then stood over.
POTTER V. PARRY.
This was a claim filed by the vendor against Henry Parry, a solicitor, for the specific performance of an agreement for the purchase of two cottages-Nos. 1 and 2, in Ely-place, Croydon, for 6001. The defendant was the occupier of the cottage No. 2, and paid the rent of 251. The defendant insisted upon an abatement of the purchase money, upon the ground of an alleged misrepresentation of the rent of No. 1, and that he was induced to believe, before he signed the agreement, that the tenant of No. 1 paid the same rent as himself,-namely, 251.,when it turned out that, although he had originally paid 251., it was afterwards reduced to 201., on account of the cottage wanting repairs. The defendant alleged this conversation, during which the misrepresentation took place, was in passing over London-bridge in March, 1855. This statement was corroborated by a friend, a journeyman baker, who was in his company at the time. During the progress of the cause the defendant issued a printed placard, which he caused to be stuck up all over Croydon, offering a reward of 51. to any person who saw the parties on Londonbridge and would give information which would corroborate other testimony. The plaintiff stated that he did not recollect any such conversation as that alleged on London-bridge, but in the garden of No. 2, when the defendant perfectly understood what was the rent of No. L
Mr. Anderson and Mr. G. W. Collins appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Bailey and Mr. Steere for the defendant.
MIr. A&Nusox was heard in reply.
The VICE-CHLuNCELLOR said that it was to be regretted that so much expense should have been incurred. Two questions wero raised- first, whether the defendant had accepted the title. This was a claim, and a model one, in respect of brevity, and simply represented that the defendant contracted to buy for 6001., and prayed specific performance. There was no suggestion that defendant had accepted title, and the claim asked no decree in that respect
In a claim, though a greater laxity was allowed, still relief must be askod, and therefore no relief could be given oa the ground of acceptance of title; nor did it appear on the evidence that there had been any such acceptance, and the plaintiff was only entitled to a common decree for specific performance, which his Honour thought he was entitled to. The next question was more difficult, as it depended on the evidence-namely, that previously to the contract the vendor represented the rent of one house higher than it actually was. One thing was clear, that if there was such a misrepresentation the other party was entitled on the abstract rule of law to compensation. His Honour then referred to tho facts, and observed that the evidence appeared to him to be conflicting. Under the old practice he should, as a matter of course, have directed an issue, but the parties here might have cross-examined the witnees vird vocc under the new practice. They had not thought fit to do so; inasmuch, however, as the matter was so trifling, he would consider the evidence himself. The effect appeared to his Honour to be that the meeting on London-bridge took place, and there was some conversation about the purchase. The balance of evidence was in favour of the defendant, and he was entitled to compensation, and there must be a reference. The plaintiff must pay the costs up to the hearing.
DUlNSTON V. DUNSTON.
In this case Sarah EmTn Dunston, a defendant in the suit, had been taken into custody and was now in prison in MaWdstone gaol, by mistake for Emily Mary Dunston, the sheriff of Kent supposing that he had that person in custody and not having made a certificate, as, It was thought, he was unwilling to acknowledge himself to be in error. A day had been appointed to examine Sarah Emma Dunston before the examiner, and under theso circumstances-
Mr. COTTEELL now asked that the sheriff of Kent might be ordered to produce Sarah Emma Daunston
The VicE-OCANcELLoRx said that a day being fixed to take the examination, the order must be that the sheriff of Kent do produce Sarah Emma Danston, or show cause why he did not do so.

MUS VTT X. USKe.
This is a suit to St aside an asgreement. The plaintiffs are Mrs. Muskett, the wtidow of the hateMr. Henr ua'skett, of Clippesby, Norfolk, and her daughter (now&rs. Etheredge); and the principal defendantis theRe,, Eenr Joseph Muslcett, the eldest son and heir at law of the deceased, with whom the agreement in question had been made. It was alleged on the purt of the plaintifs that iu 1849 Mr.
Muskett had made a will whereby he had given an at,uity of 2001. to Mrs. IMuskett for her life, and an annluity of like amnunt to MIrs. Etheredge for her life, both annuities being charged on his real estates. After purporting to give legacies (the amounts of which, however, vere left in blank), the testator had bequeatbed his residuary personal estate to the derendant, to whom also ho devised the wh,nlb of his rea estate, charged with the annuities, with this qualification, that in case the defendant should 'i'e without leavil.g issue living at his death the said real estate should go to ihis (the testator's) three daughters (of whonm Mrs. Eth.redge was one), as tenants in common in eoual shares. The testator dieui on the 27th of October, Th51, and the agreement in 9uestion was signed by the piaintiffs and defendant on the
dof Nov ember, By the agreement, v-which pattiaily reeited the will, and that doubts were entertained as to its validity in consequence of the imperfect prepdration of the same and theinformal execution thereof, the defendant agreed to lay out 2501. in furniture to be eiijo% ed by his mother for her life, to pay an annuity of 300t. to her for life (in lien of all claims under the will, and also of all dower or thirds), to pay to his sister an annuity of 0l0l. during the joint lives of herself and her mother, this annuity to be increased on the death of her mother to 200!., in full satisfaction of her claim to the annuity under the will and of aU other claims on the estate. The agreement did not recite or contain any reference to the contingent devise made to the daughters in the event of there being no issue of the defendant, as to whom it was alleged by the bill that he was married in the year 1847, and had no children. The plaintiffs seek to set aside the agreement on the ground that it was signed by them on the evening of the funeral of the testator under pressure, and under the influence of groundless apprehenesons as tothe in-validity of the will, and mn ignorance of their rights (especially on the part of the widow as to her dower, which was stated to amount to between 300!. and 400!. per annum), without the means of due consideration or having independent professional advice; and that the benefit of the agreement was wholy on the side of the defendant. On the other hand, the defence is rested on the alleged facts that the plaintiffs well knew wh; they were about, that the agreement had been prepared bythe solicitor who had been appointed by the will co-executor with Mrs. Muskett, and had been signed by her and her daughter under his advice. With respect to the will itself, it appeared that, as part of the arrangement made at the time of the agreement, letters of administration, with the will annexed, had been granted to the defendant. It also appeared that the first apprehensions entertained by the plaintiffs as to the security and propriety of the agreemnent were in the early part of l855 after which some correspondence took place between their Eolicitor, Mr. Yetts (who is a relative of the family), and the defendant, in the course of which the defendant was rurged to let the agreement be cancelled. This, however, he declined to do, and hence the present suit. The evidence was presented to the Court in the shape of affidavits, some of which were made by the plaintiffs and defendant and other members of the family, as to the circuiustances under which the agreement was signed. This evidence it is quite impossible to give in extenso, and it is only necessary to state that there was a certain amount of discrepancy as to the precise facts relied on Dby the plaintiffs which their counsel contended was sufficiently accounted for by the painful feelin6s under which the widow especially might naturally be supposed to be labourng at so short an interval after the funeral of her husband. With respect to the law of the case, many well known cases were cited in which the interference of tbis Court had been applied for in relation to disputes arising out of family arrangements.
Mr. Rolt and Mr. Surrage appeared for the plaintiffsMr. Batten for the husband of Mrs. Etheredge ; and Mr. Cairns and Mr. Baggalay for the defendant, Mr. Uuskett.

.THE QTJEEN V. MARUA CL,ARK-IN RE ALICIA RAES.
(SWings in Banco, before Lora. CA.IrDELL and over
Judaes.I
Jn 'nui case a 1haoeas corpus had issued to Maria Clarke, the matron of the Sailors' Orphan Girls' School at Hampstead, to bring up the body of Alicia Race with a view to her being delivered up to her mother, a Roman Catholic, in order thab she might be placed in a Roman Catholic school. The motion was resisted on the ground that the wishes of the child, who was unwilling to be removed, ought to be consulted; and, secondly, because, under the circumstances the mother's was not the proper cnstody, inasmuch as the father of the child died a Protestant and had always brought up his children as Protestants, and wheu the mother placed the child at the school in question she professed to be carry. ing out her deceasec husband's wishes in having the child educated in the Protestant religion.
The case was argued at great length before Lord Campbell, Mr. Justice Wightman, and Mr. Justice Crompton, on the 17th inst., by Mr. Serjeant Shee and Mr. Finlason on the part of the mother; by Mr. O'Malley, Q. C., and Mr. Lush, on the part of the school; and by Mr. BoviM, Q.C., on the part of the Patriotic Fund Commissioners, at whose expense the child was being educated.
The COURT having taken time to consider,
Lord C,MrrsLL now delivered judgment, as follows:In this case we are to determine what direction ought to be given by the Court respecting Alicia Race, an infant of the age.of 10 years and a few months, brought up under a writ of habcas corpus granted at the instance of her mother. On the one side it is contended that we ought at once to order the child to be deUvered to the mother, and on the other that we should ask the child to make her election whether to go home with her mother, or to return to the school from which her mother wishes to remove her. It is not disputed that, the father having died without appointing a guardian, the mother is now guardian for nurture, and it is laid down (3 Co. Rep., 38 b.) that the guardianship for nurture continues till the child attains the age of 14. An observation was made that the commissioners of the school are in loco parentis ; but this was little relied unon, and is wholly untenable. As a general rule, it is admitted that if a child under seven years is so brought up the Court ought at once to order the child to be delivered to the guardian. But the contention is that between the ages of 7 and 14 the Court ought to examine the child and ascertain whether it has mental capa. city to be competent to make a choice, and, according to the degree of mental capacity which it is found to possess, to hand it over to the guardian or to liberate it, and to de. sire it to go where it pleases. With regard to the maintenance of the poor, a rule has been introduced that while a child is under seven it shall not be separated from the mother for the purpose of being maintained by the parish in which it is settled. Again, by Serjeant Talfourd's Act 2d and 3d of Victoria, c. 54, s. 1, it is enacted that when infants under the age of seven are in the sole custody or control of the father, the Lord Chancellor or the Master of the Rolls may make an order that such infants shall be delivered to and remain in the custody of the mother until they attain the age of seven years. Under seven is sometimes caUed "the age of nurture," but this is the peculiar nurturc required by a chUld from its mother, and is entirely different from guardianship for nurture, which belongs to the father in his lifetime, even from the birth of the child. We can find no distinction in the books as to the rights and incidents of this species of gnardianship from the time when it commences till the time when it expires. One of these incidents is, that the guardian should be entitled to the culstody of the person of the child; without such right he could not pessibly perform the duties cast upon him as guardian. He is to " nurture" the child ; the legal sense of this word is its natural and common sense in the Eng3ish language, wbich Dr. Johnson says is " to educate, to train, to bring up ;" accordingly, from the case to be found in the Year Books (8 Ed. IV., 7 b.) to the present time it has ever been considered that the father, or whoever else en his death may be the guardian for nurture, has by law a right to the custody of the child, and shall maintain an action for trespass against a stranger who takes the child. (See authorities Coam. i Dig., ' Guardian D.) The question then arises, whether a habeas corpus be the proper remedy for the guardian to recover the custody of the child of which he has been improperly deprived. Certainly, the great use of this writ, the boast of English jurisprudence, is to set at liberty any of the Queen's subjects unlawfully imprisoned; and when an adult is brought up under a 7abcast corpus and found to be unlawfully imprisoned, he is to have his unfettered choice to go where he pleaes. But, with respect to a child under guardisnship for nurture, the child is supposed to be unlawfully imprisoned when unlawfully detained from the custody of the guardian, and when delivered to him the child is supposed to be set at liberty. "Rex v. Mandeville" (5 East., 220) clearly proves that such is the fit mode of proceeding, if the child is under seven. Is there any reason for following a different course between seven and 14 ? The intellectnal faculties of the child may be considerably developed in this interval, and the child may now have a very strong inclination to leave the home of the guardian, and, from religious as well as frivolous motives, to be educated at a different school from that which the guardian has selected. But the consequences whichx would follow from allowing such a choice are most alarming. We must lay down a rule which wiU be generally beneficial, although it may operate harshly in paIticular insances. If the proposed choice were given to the child the relation of guardia,i aud ward would still subsist; the guardian might retake the child wherever he found it; and he might maintain an action against the
prson who, contrary to his wishes, takes or detains the child. rhen, how could "I nurture' be carried on with such a doctrine, which, if established, would apply to every father of a family in the kingdom in respect of all his children, male and female, above the age of seven years? If a father wishes to take his son, when 10 years old, fromii a private school where flogging is not practised and send him to Eton, and the boy refuses to come home and is brought up by )szeas corpus, is he to be permittedto say that, on consideration, he is of opinion that the private school is preferable te any public school where flogging is permitted, and therefore makes his election to return to the private school, the master being willing to receive him? Or, suppose that a Protestant mother, guardian for nurture of a daughter seven years of age, sends her to a boarding school profeesing to be a P
testantseminary ina short time she finds that attempts have been successftlly made by teachers there to convert the girl to the Roman Catholic faith; the girl refuses to come home, saying, in -nalogy to the language used by Alicia Race, "I Vwilno' go home to my own mother; I wl l stay 1sre where I may pray to *he mother of God;" she is in consequence brought up by habews corpus. Are we to examine her, and, findmg her of auick parts, and professing to be a sincere convert to the tnman Catholic faith, to tell her that in spite of the wishes of her mother she is at liberty to return to the school where she has been converted ? Such a doctrine seems wholly inconsistent with parental authority, which both reason and r v lation teach us to respect as essential for the welfare of the human race. Indeed, alluions were made during the argument at the bar to the workings of prevenient grace a!d t!:e words of our Lird, " .8uffer little children and f',: wd them not to cc me unto n:e; for of sich is the king-
d m of Heaven." It mutt be enough merely to say that tt.e parental authority is in no degree weakened by such sacred doctrines or [precepts, for it is impossible without irreverence to showl more fully how irrelevant they are. This suggests the extreme inconvenience which would ariso from the proposed examination of the child. If there is to be an examination, it ought to be conducted before all the judges who are to take part in the adjudication ; and, after testing her mental acumen, we ought to ascertain whether it is upon due investigation that she has imbibed a preference for Protestantssm, and such an aversion from the Roman Catholic faith. When we look into our law books, although we do not find the exact age dsiSned within wbich the Court, on a habeas corpus, will order the child to be delivered up to the parent or guardian without examination, we do find cases where this course has been adopted, the child being above seven years of age, and we find nothing to indicate that the rights of the guardians for nurture are in any respect impaired during the period of the guardianshi'. In "eX. V. Johnson" (Str. 579, 2 Lord Ptaym., 1,333 a female child, nine years old, was brought up by hscbeces corpus in the custody of her nurse, having a testamentary guardian appointed by the father. The Court at first doubted whether they should go any further than to see that the child was not under any illegal restraint, but afterwards declared that, this being the case of a young child who had no judgment of her own, they ouglht to deliver her to her guardian, although she was very unwilling to be taken from Mrs Johnson, her nurse, who was her near relation, and had cared for her very tenderly and disinterestedly. It was afterwards said in "Rex v. Smith" (Str. 982) that Lord Raymond, who had been aparty to this judgment, repented of w'hat he had done; but in his own report of the case he throws no discredit upon it, and Lord Mansfield afterwards expressed stro)pg approbation of the caEe, and said that if Lord Raymond had changed his mind his first judgment was clearly the right one. 1 Sir . Bl., 413.) It is unnecessary to travel through the cases scriatim, as they are all reviewed in "Rex v. Greenhill" (4 Ad. and EU., 624), where the Court laid down the rule that where a young person under 21 years of age is brought before the Court by habeas corpus, if he be of an age to exercise a choice, the Court leaves the infant to elect where he wiU go- but if he be not of that age, the Court must make an order for his being placed in proper custody. Lord Denman, Littledale, J., Willams, J., and Coleridge, J., aU makerage the criterion, and not mental capacity, to be ascertained by examination. They certainly do not expressly specify the age, but they cannot refer to seven as the criterion, and there is no intervening age marking the rights or responsibility of an infant till 14, when guardianship for nurture ceases, upon the supposition that the infanthas now reached the years of discretion. When we attend to the authorities cited by the counsel for the commissioners we find soma vague dicta, and even some decisions which at first sight give a colour to the doctrine of examination and chroice under 14, but which admit of an explanation entirely consistent with the claim of the guardian. In " Rex v. Smith" (Str. 982), " Rex. v. Johnson" is said to have been overruled because a boy who had not completedhisl4thyear,beingbroughtup by7habeas coi-pus at the suit of the father from the custody of an aunt, with whom he wished to live, was set at liberty, instead of being delivered up to his father, and was allowed to return to his aunt; but Lord Mansfield, in commenting upon this case, gives the true ratio decidendi upon which, and upon which alone, it can be supported,-" That case was determined rigllt; for the Court was certaii.ly right in refusing the infant to the father, of whose design in applying for the custody of his child they had a bad opinion."-" Rex v. Delaval" (3 Burr., 1,437). There is anadmitted qualification on the right of the father or guardian-if he be grossly immoral, or if he vishes to have the child for any unlawful purpose. The counsel for the commissioners relied much upon the case of "Ann Lloyd" (3 Manning and Grainger, o47), where the mother of an illegitimate child, between 11 and 12 years of age, haviDg obtained a habeas corpus directed to the putativefather tobringit up, the Courtrefused to order it to be delivered to the mother, and declared that it might use its own discretion; and, the child being unwilling to go with the mother, the Court would not allow the mother to take it by force. But Maule, J., there asked, "fow does the mother of an iilegitimate child differ from a stranger ?" And, although the relation of the mother of an ilegitimate child is recognized for some purposes, it is clear that she has not over it all the rights of guardian for nurture. From what was said by Lord Ellenborough in "Rex v. Hopkins" 7 East, 578), it would appear Ihat it is only while an ilegitimate child is under seven (an age during which the law of nature and the law of the land bth say that the child, whether legitimate or illegitimate, oughtnot to be separated from the mother) that the Court will interfere to protect the custody of the mother. In Ann Lloyd's case the child was consiierably above that age. The only other decision much rehed upon as to the right of the
'arent or guardian, on a habeas corpus, was "Rex v. reston" ( Dowlig and Lowndes), where a most distinguished judge (Mr. Justice Patteson) refused to grant a writ of habeas corpus to bring up a legitimate child above the age of seven on the alleged application of the mother, who had become guardian for nurture, the father being dead. But the application was made under a power of attorney, the mother remaining in the East Indies-so that thechd could not have been delivered to her. The real opinion of my brother Patteson upon this subject we have fortunately an opportunity of knowing from a note of Sir Erskine Perry, late Chief Justice of Bombay, in a very in. teresting collection of "'Oriental Cases" decided and published by him. A Parsee family having detained an infant from its father, a Parsee, on the ground that the father had emnbraesd the Christian religion, on a habeas corpus the Court had ordered the child to be given up to the father. In another case, the Court, on habeas corpus, had ordered a Hindoo boy of 12 years of age, who professed to have embraced Chnstianity, to be delivered up to his father, who adhered to the Hindoo religion, and the judges refused to examine the boy as to his capacity and knowledge of the Christian religion. In similar cases, the Supreme Court at Calcutta had followed a different course. There being no appeal in such matters to a higher Court, Sir Erskine Perry, for his subsquent guidance, very properly submitted The question. to my brother Patteson, whose response was as follows :-III cannot doubt that you were quite right in holding that the father was entitled to the cutstody of his child, and enforcing it by writ of habeas corpws. The genieral law is clearly so, and even after the age of 14, whereas the boy was only 12. The right might, indeed, be forfeited by misconduct of a very gross nature, but nothing of that kind appears to have been brou t forward. It may have been an act of imprudence originallyin the father to place his boys with persons who were likely to bring them up in religious opinions and faith contrary to their father's. I suppose he made some stipulations for avoiding this. But whether he did or not, I do not think that the law would be affected thereby. Even if he had changed his mind on that subject, as well as on the education of his boys in other respects, I know of no law which forbids him to do so, er birnds him to the arrangement -which he had at firstmade." (Oriental Cases, p. 109. )For- these reasons, and on these authorities, we are of opinion in the present case that jn-irsf facie the mother is entitled as guardian for nurture to have her ohid deliered over to her. Still, she may have for-
feited her right by pror imnmoral conduct ; or by proof that she does not make the application bond fide; ;or by bhavin some illegal act in view when she has ebtained posession
of the child. According to " Rex v. Greenhill,"e immo-
rality to extinguish the rightof the parent or guardian to the custody of the child must be of a gross nature, so that the cbild would to in serious dange fcontainination by living with her. But here no immaorality whatever is imputed to Mrs. Race, and she seems to have been a virtuous woman, well deserving the ardent affection which her husband felt for her. An attempt is mnade to show that in aplI to this Couirt she is a mere tool in the had fohr.bt on carefully lookuing hog h fiais ed o e that this charge Is sbttitdanwehnkhtwear

As the law stands, since the repeal of the statute for prosecuting Papists, the question must be the same under the actual circumstancea of this case as if the father had died a Roman Catholic and the mother surviving
had been aProtestant, Would it in that case have been unlawful for the mother to have brought up the children as Protestants ? The cases of " ViUareal v. htelish" (2 Swanston, b36) and " Talbot v. the Earl of Shrewsbury" (4 Mylne and Craig, 672) show that in such matters the Courts know of no distinction between different religions, and will not interfere with the discretion of guardians as to the faith in which they educate their wards. The authority relied upon to show that the ward must
invariably be educated in the religion of the father is, " In re Arabella Francis North," before Vice-Chancellor
Knight Bruce ( 1 Jurst, n. That case arising joi.tly on a return to a habe s corpus, and on a petition for the appoint-
ment of Aguarc antocildren as wards of the Court of Chancer, it is difficult to distingui8h what was done or said by the ViceChancellor as a common law and as an equity judge. He cannot be alleged to have decided anything upon this point, and he had only to consider it with a view of determining whether the children should for a few days till a
guardian was appointed, be in the custody of a R omian ar2 olc or of a rotestant nurse. He certainly does draw
an inference of fact that the father died a Protestant. although for some time before his death he had conformed
to the worship of the Reman Catholic Church, ad, when dy g, w zould notpermit p the m ,inistration of a Protestant clergyman, and his Honour does express anopinion that, although the wife had been formally admlitted into
Ihe Roirran Catholio Churcb, the children must be educated in the Protestant faitb, the father havin3g given no directions upon tho subject by will. But this doctrine, if well founded, will only apply to the education of wards of the Court of Cbancery, respecting whom an equity udge, representiug the Queen as pacrssa aiceir, ha; a very large discretion, and may give directions beyond the scope of the duties of a guardian for aurture under the common law. Therefore, v,;thout venturing to question the dictum of so eminent a judge (although it seems not altogether to accord with what was 8aid by Lord Chancellor Cottenbam in "Talbot v. the Earl of Shrewsbury), we do not think it enough to show that the mother of the inant, as guardian for nurture, was legally bound to educate the children as Protestants, or that she can be charged with an illegal purpose when intending to send them to a Roman Cathohc school. The comrmissioners in detaining the girl from her mother have no doubt acted from the mostlaudable motives; but they are wrong in point of law in supposing that the mother, by committing the child to their care, has lost all right over her. In the case cited from the Year Books, it was held that " if a guardian by reason of nurture delivers the infant to another for instruction, he m-ay afterwards retake the infant," and this is vouched for good law by Chief Baron Comyn in his Digest. It might be everv way much better for this child to remain in thesehool at Empstead, which appears to be in all respects so admirably conducted, and we may individually deplore her rernoval from it; but in this matter, as there is nothing contrary to law in contemplation, we have no jurisdiction to determine; and we think that we are bound, in the discharge of our judicial duty, to order that the infaut, Aleia Race, be now delivered up to her mother. We trust that she will ever be treated by her mother with the affection and tenderness anticipated by her father in the letter which he wrote when he foresaw that he was soon to fall in defence of his country.
Mr. O'MALLEY thereupon rose and said he had an application to make to the Court, upon affidavit, that the judgment now pronounced should not be immediately executed. The learned counsel then read the affidavit of Robert Sweeting, of Clement's-lane, Lombard-street, attorney for the Sailors' Orphan Girls School.
Lord CAMEvsnLL-Is that an affidavit wvhich might have been read before, or of something new!
Mr. O'MA.,Lx said it stated new matter; that on the 20th inst. a bill had been filed at the instance of the committee of the said school, whereby the said Alicia Race had been made a ward of Chancery- and that, by leave of ViceChancellor Kinderpley, notice had been given of an application for an injunction, to be heard at the sitting of the Court this morning, restraining the mother from taking possession of her said daughter, and from sueing out any futare writ of habe. corpus. The affidavit stated that the said bill in Chancery further prayed the appointment of a fit and proper person to be guardian other than the mother - and that there was an affidavit in the said suit that as soon as the mother obtained possession of her daughter she intended to take her away to Ireland. The deponent further stated that he believed the njunction was now being argued before the Vice-Chancellor, and that it was intended to prosecute the said suit with despatch, and that it was probable the proceedings for the appointment of a guardian would be conceuded witbin a month. The learned counsel also read the affidavit of the Rev. E. H. Bickersteth, to the effect that in November last the mother said to him that when she obtained possession of the child she intended to take her away with her to Ireland.
Lord CArsFBELL-It is my opinion that the order of this Court should be immediately executed. We have done our duty, and the Vice-Chancellor will do his.
lMlr. Serjeant Sns applied that the child should be brought into court and delivered up to her mother.
Lord CAPBEL: said, be thought that would not be necessary, butthe order of the Court must be immediately

Lord CAMIPBELL said, this Court would take no notice of the injunection. The Court had pronounced its order, and that order must he obeyed.
During this discussion there was great excitement in the court which was crowded with the friends of both parties, but this was ultimately allayed by Lord Campbell's directing that the patent case of " Lister v. Leathe" should be proceeded with. The parties then withdrew from court, and we are informed that the Rev. Mr. Bickersteth, with some lind expressions, and assuring her she would be kindly treated, delivered the girl up to her mother and her solicitor. The mother took hor daughter up in her arms and kissed her sevseral times, but the daughter, a child of very interesting appearance, looked pale and excited, and did not at all reciprocate her mother's caresses though she appeared very pleased to see her brother, and kissed his hand several

In ums case mr. erjeant BYTES and Mr. ADDIso?? showed cause against a rule for an injunction, moved under the provisions of the Railway and Canal Traffic Act, and Mr. Bovllle, QC., appeared in support of it.
The rule called upon the defendants to carry coals and coke for Mr. Oxlade at the same rate, to afford him the same facilities for forwarding and delivering his coals and coke as were afforded to others. and to provido him reason. able accommodation for unloading his coals and coke at the various stations of the defendants' railway, and to afford hin the same facilities and accommodation at those stations for unloading his coals and coke as they afforded to various colliery owners.
The learned counsel for the defendants contended that the defendants had done all they had the power to do. They could not build further station accommodation where requred, as they had not the land to do it; and what Mr. Orade now required them to do all the colliery owners might require.
The learned counsel for the applicant contended that the defendants were bound, under theRailway and Canal Traffic Act, to carry at equal rates and to afford equal accommoda. tion to all parties using their railway, and they were also bound to do thq, same thing as common carriers of coal and coke. But the defendants took upon themselves to prevent any one carrying but whom they chose, and they, in fact, established a monopoly which the Traffic Act was passed to prevent. They afforded accommodation for unloading at theirstatioiisbybuildingsevenceDsundertesiding rails, and these cells they had let at a rent to certain parties, and when Mr. Oxlade, as one of thepublic,wanted to unload his coals, he *was told they had no accommodation for him. The defend. ants also charged a halfpenny per ton per mile to those with whom they had contracts, and charged Mr. Oxade three fa-rthingEs per ten per mile, which, in 100 mailes, made a difference of 2s. per ton in the price of the coals, mwhih was tantamount to prohibiting him to sell them, and was establishinthose with whom tle defendants had contracts as monopo . s. They also ref uel to forward Mrx. OxIade?s waggons beyond York, the terminus of their line, while they forwarded the waggons of those with whom they had contracts.

fARRISSON AND ANOTIMRn V. RAY.
The plaintiffs are coal merchants carrying on their business in Caroline-place, Camden-town. The defendant is a cowhkeeper In the Caledonian.road, and this action was brought to recover 231 8s. for the p rico of a cart.
The defendant, among other pleas, pleaded a set-off of 501., and the substantial question in the cause was whether that aum was due to him from the plaintiffs.
d It apaed that the introduction of the plaintiffs to the
defen nt had been caused by an advertisement of the latter for the sale of the business in Caroline-place, now carried on by the plaintiffs, and that on the 28th day of February, f85, the plaintiffs entered into an agreement with the defendant for the purchase of the lease and goodwill for 1,000L, the stock in trade to be taken at a valuation. The unexpired term was not more than two yers, and, accrd. lng to the statement of the plaintiffs of what passed between temra nd the defencdant during the negotiations, the defendant bad told them that, though the term was short, the landlord would extend it without raising the rent, which then was 581. per annum. The day for completing the purchase was the 29th of April. On that day, hut before completing, the plaintiffs proposed to the defendant to see the landlord, and the three accordin Iy went to him, and, in answer to the question by one of the plaintiffs whether the house was to be continued at the same rent, he replied, " Certainly not," and that he was surprised he should be asked the guestion, as he had given the mame answer before. The plaintiffs, finding that the rent would bo raised, refused to conclude the purchase; but, accordingto the evidence on their behalf, it was subae.
uently arranged between them and the defendant that they sould be allowed to retain 501. of the price which, except for the misunderstanding about the rent, they would have bad to pay, and they settled the matter in other respects accordig to the agreement of Feb. 28, paying in bills and cah about 1,W31.
The witnesses called for the plaintiffs were the two plain. tif and a Mr. Alexander, the landiord, who stated that he
adneverpromisedthe defendant to grant bhim an extensicn of the term at the same rent, and that at the interview above referred to lie had statad that he shlonld require v51. per annum when he renewed the lease. lIe moreover, said that at a subsequent intewvie vwith the de'
fendant the latter had stated that the pl3intiffs had compelled him to leave 30L in their hands.
The only witness for the defence was the defendant, who contradicted the evidence of the plaintiffs in several particulars, and said he had never told them that the landlord would renew the lease at the same rent; that he had been asked bythe elder plaintiff to sign an agreement in pencil (meanng the agreement relating to the 501.), but had refused; that he (the defendant) had told them what he had sold he would fulfil to the letter; that the plaintiffs never refunsed to complete the purchase, and, with respect to his allowvng th2ni to retain 501. hn their hands, that he had never agrzeed to any terms at all.
The jury found their verdict for the plaintiffs for the sum claimed, 231. 8S.
Mr. Joseph Browvn was counsel for the plaintiflf and Mr. Daly for the defendant.

It appeared that the plaintiffs are aldermen of the city of Jondon, and brought this action, as trustees of the Argus Insurance-office, npon ahond. A wiitness was called for the defence to prove payment, but failed in doing so, and a verdict was found for the plaintif£s for S09LS. 8d.

The bankrupts were tobacco manufactaurers of Lower Thamies-street. This was an adjourned certificate meeting.
Mr. LAwRAxcE said, his Honour had ordered an adjourn ment of the certificate meeting in this case in consequence of the bankrapts having been the acceptors of certain biUs of exchange, the drawers of which were alleged to be fictitious persons. The bankrupts were young men who had succeeded to a large business with inadequate capitaL In accepting these blls they had done so under the influence of lMr. Holland, tobbacco broker, a person of mature age, and who had been engamed many years in the tobacco trade. The question was, had oUlland used the names of fictitions persons for purposes of his own, or had the bankrupts a criminal knowledge of the facts? The assignees thought that the bankrupts could not he absolved from very great neglect and want of mercantile prudence, but they were wil lng to believe that this was the extent of their misconduct. The assignees did not object to the Commissioner now adjudicating on the question of certificate, and regretted that the bankrupts' weakness towards lr. HoUand should have allowed them to be so imposed upon.
Mr. LThxLATmi, for the bankrapts, said, they had no desire to avoid inquiry, and he was desirous to correct any erroneous impression-that his clients were even charged with a eriminal knowledge of the character of the biUs to which they had unfortunately put their names. It could not be deined that a most scandalous fraud had been committed by some one; but it was due to the bankrupts to observe that they had at once placed themselves in the bands of their creditors on discovering the character of the bills, and thus prevented any extension of the evil. HoUand was not now to be found at the address he had given, Yorkcottage, Haverstock-hill, and he was not surprised at such a result.
Mr. BAGLEY (for Mr. Delapere, banker, of Paris) said, he thought that the duty of instituting further investigation bad been cast upon the bankrupts, and not upon his client. His Honour had said at the last sitting that an atrocious fraud had been committed, and that it was better even for themselves that there should be an adjournment of the consideration of the bankrupts' certificate.
His Howoups was still of this opinion. The bankrupts might be able to show that they were perfectly clear of anything beyond impradence. There would be an adjournment for two months, and the assignees would act judiciously to concur with the assignees of the other bankrupts, who stood in any way connected with the transactions, in prosecuting a joint inquiry.
Adjournment accordingly.
(Before Mr. Commissioner HoLRoYD.) IN BE THE ROYAL BRITISH BANK.
Mr. LINRIATI-W-Wil1 your Honour allow me to ment'on that a petition was appointed to be heard this morning on the part of Mr. Humphrey Brown for the purpose of annulling the adjudication? The account between Mr. Brown and the bank is one of a very complicated and voluminous character, involving very many details; and the assignees, acting under the sanction of the Court, have considered it advisable that that account shall be at once made the subject of arbitration in order that the enormous expense of litigation and legal preceodings may be avoided, and with the view also of enabling Mr. Brown to do that which he has kindly promised to do, namely-aid the assignees in the realization of their securities, and also give other valuable information, by which the estate wiU be very materiaUy beneftted. Your Honour has been pleased to sanction that eourse, and of course Mr. Brov n has no farther object in the prosecution of such a petition as this. Mr. Greville, who appears on his behalf, therefore abandons this petition and desires to withdraw it, and I, on the part of the assigneos, am content that it shaU be dismissed without costs. There is one matter to which I might take the liberty of referring, and that is the introduction into this petition of the term " fraud" with reference to the adindication. There is an allegation in this petition that the adjudication was obtained in fraud. Sir, undoubtedly that is an introdaction which I am happy to say is not attributable to the solicitors who presented this petition, but rather, I believe, to the counsel who drew it, and that it was introduced without instructions. I take this opportunity of mentioning it because Messrs. Tucker and Co., who presented thispetition,themomenttheyfoundthatwas considered to be an objectionable term wrote to me long before the arrangement was made with Mr. Humphrey Brown, intimating their regret that that term had been introduced into the petition, stating that it had been hastily prepared, and asking that they might be permitted to wit hdraw it; to which I readily assented, and of course it was withdrawn. I only regret that even in the haste of the preparation of the petition such a term should have been used. If it had not been withdrawn I should have felt it my duty to chaUenge an inquiry why such a charge of fraud had been introduced. However, I am glad to say all the differences between Mr. Humphrey Brown and the assignees are at an end, and I believe the arrangements which have been made will redound not only to the credit of Mr. Humphrey Brown, but to the advantage of the estate.
Mr. GRv ILLE.-Sir, I appear for Mr. Humphrey Brown in this case, andI have great pleasure in statin that matters have been substantially arranged between Mr. Hlumphrey Brown and the asignees; and I am confident that course wiU be most to the interest of aU parties. The accounts between MIr. Brown and the bank are of a most voluminous character, aud the securities which the bank hold will be better realized by the assistance of Mr. Brown. I believe he can render the most efficient assistance to the bank, not only in that respect, but in the affairs generaUy. With regard to the introduction of the charge of fraud into the petition to which Mr. Linklater has aluded, the fact he has stated is correct, and I am sorry it was introduced, as I always regret any personal matter being introduced into maters of this imRortant character. I believe MIr. Linklater is quite satis-
wiedwth the charge bceing withdrawn, and we stand, as we always hope to stand, on friendly relations together.
The COrn'sssIrSIOE.-Then the petition will be dis. missed without costs.
Mr. LLN7KLTEa.-.Without costs.
The ComESSxIoNxR.-I think that is a liberal course to take on the part of the assignees in consequence of what has been mentioned with regard to the allegation of fraud.
3r. GREVILLEr.-No doubt, Sir.

Mr. Martin, the chief clerk, said he had received a similar offer from a bargemaster, who was desirous of employing the boy.
Mr. Phillips, the master of the West London 'Union Eaid, the boy had evidently been leading a street life, sleeping at night at the refuge and getting his food durinz the day how and where he cotld for so long past, and was in sach a state of health that he would be unable to leave the union for some days. He (fr. Phillips) had received three separate applications from different persons offering to the lad full employment, so that if his character upon inquiry proved satisatory there would be no difficultr in getting him a situation. With regard to Ar. Carpenterrs correspondent, as he ap red to have agricultural employment for destitute = he (ifr. Phillips) wished to inform him that there were at the present time four lads in the union, having no legal claim upon it, who would be a credit to any one who would give them employment. If the gentleman offering to provide for the boy Lock would take these four boys he would be performing an act of great charity.
Mfr. Carpenter said, he would communicate Kr. Phillips sugeestion with reference to the other lads to the gentleman, and let him know the result.

A friend appeared for the defendant, who pleaded guilty to all the charges, involving fines to the amount of 1,00.L, but, in mitigation, represented that he was only the servant of the real proprietor -who was an insolvent.
Mr. hXXRY said, that was a very improper arrangement, but it did not affect the liability of defendant as the person in whose name the license had been taken out. His worship inflicted a fine of 3001. on the first count only, the Excise waving the remaining penalties.

Dreadful Affray With Poachers At Hythe.-
DR.EADruB Am A&y 'vrm POACHE11S AT 1HYTHE.- A conflict with poachers occurred at Bythe, between 2 anc 3 o'clock on the morning of Sunday last, in which two men were so injured that their lives are despaired of. James Dean, a gamekeoper on the estste of Mr. A. IR. Drummond, of Cadlands, heard the report of a gun in Stanswood copse. He immediately got up, took a large mastiff with him, and went to the spot. He there discovered two men, whom he endeavoured to arrest; they resisted, and one of them had a long struggle with the keeper, duriug vhiclh the latter was shot t`rongh the left side. The keeper fell, but had strength enough left to get to the assistance of the dog who had attacked one of the men and take its muzzle off. The other poacher immediately made off, but the dog seized him by the arm and shoulder, and dragged him to the ground. The poacher began to shriek for mercy, calling oat thiat his name was Blow, and that he would surrender if Dean would take the dog off. The keeper, though exhausted from loss of blood, crawled to the rescue, and released the poacher from his dangerous situation, but the dog burbt away again, bringinF the poacherto the ground. Onc more the keeper muzzlea the paog,and released the poor wvretch, rwho by this time vas reduced to a worse state than Dean himself. Assistance very shortly came the keepor was taken home, and a surgeon was sent for; Lut before his wounds could be dressed a second summons arrived from the poacher Blow. Both were in a very precarious state. Dean was shot completely through the side, and it wvas doubtful whether he would survive. The poacher Blow was frightftully mangled about the head, face, and arms-more injnred, if possible, than Dean. A man named Arnold has been arrested on a charge of aiding Blow.-Southanmpton Frec Prss.

Education And Crime.
BEDCATION AN D CRIMB.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-The article in your paper of yeaterday on the subject of popular education was certainly not uncalled for, It directs attention to points which have been far too much ove;looked by those who are 5triving to elevate the standard of instruction for the masses, and who iwmagine they see in the improved mental cultivati'on of these both a sure and a rapid remedy for alL rur social evils.
I cannot help feeing, howvever, that many readers will rise from tha 'perusal of the article in question in a temper verq' different from that which (L apprebend) the w"r.isr would wish to inspire. They will lanqy that education is, after all, wvhat our grandfathers used to describe it-a very unsafeexperiment; and that, if it makes the lower classes unsettled and -dssatisfied with their position in life, to encourage at is me'ely to supply fuel for the smouldering fire ,of discontent which even in the best social organizations will exist in the breasts of the unsuccessful or 3heidl-tempered.
Education," you say, " is a most powerful de:reioper of human nature; it is an engine which, when applied to the mind of man, has the effect of bringing out all its resources and capacities,-tastes, ~affections, passions,-all its elements, moral and *antellectuLal." This description, allow me to say, errs by defect. You should have added the words " symmetrically and normally. " That is what education in its highest form professes to do, and what all education which deserves the name does to some extent effect. Education is for the mind what gymnasties are for the body. Air and exercise develope physical strength, and the training of the gymnastic master distributes this in such a way as to educe the greate-st perfection attainable by the object of his care. Just in the same way does the skilful edu-cator aim to produce a normal development of the mind of his pupil morally, as well as intellectually. If a youth does not grow up a better man as well as an abler one for the education he has received, aU that can be said is that the education has, from one cause or other, been a bad one. This it may be from many causes. It will be a bad one if the scholar is induced to regard intelectual culture as the one object of value, orevenworse, as valuable chiefly on account of its furnishing a means of advancing himself in life-a topic which amateur educationists, if they reallv wish to elevate the character of the masses, insist uipon a great deal too much at mechanics' institutes and similar places. An education will also be a bad one if it aims at a -moral culture, but adopts a false standard of morality; as, for instance, in ancient Sparta, or at this day in the schools of Mahomedan countries, or in those of Christendom wbere a spirit of sectarianism is allowed to dominate in the teaching. Or it may be a bad one through the ignorance, or inability, or -want of moral courage in the individual teacher, who may be imperfectly acquainted with the subjects in which he professes to give instruction, or deficient in the knowledge of human nature, especially boyish nature-a very common case,or unduly submissive to the desires of the parents of his pupils-a commoner case still. WVith all these disturbing influences, and a hundred more which might' be added, surely there is no reason for wonder that education should often fail in its object; and the only practical question is whether, though it be not a panacea for the evil tendencies of human nature, it is not by far the most promising prophylactic, and in many instances an eflicient medicine.
It should not be forgotten, either by the friends or the opponents of popular education, that there is a vast portion of the training of every child which lies altogether out of the sphere of the schoolmaster. The early influences of home are far greater, both for good and evil, than any which can ordinarily be brought to bear in after life. WVhat can all the efforts of a Committee of Council do more than mitigate-if even that-the po.son imbibed in the wretched hovel, devoid of even the means of preserving the decencies of life, in an atmosphere redolent of gin, and ringing with curses and ribaldry all day long? Even where matters are not £o bad as this, how little can the sympathies of childhood be called inito healthy activity in the homes of the very poor ! I think it is Charles Laamb who says, " Poor people have no time to bri)ig i1p their children ; they drag tftem vp." How can the toiling labourer and his gaunt -wife, ground to the very earth with care to provide their daily bread, find time or spirits for that intercourse with their childlren which, under more favourable circumstances, lays the foundation for nine-tenths of all that is good in after life ? Surely, the true cause for -wonder is, not that the school should do so little for the children of the poor, but that it should have done so inuch as it has. Let the Legislature try if it cannot supplement the school by multiplyiug the gratuitous enjoyments of a harmless character, of wvhichparents and children may partake together. Let us have more people's parks as well as penitentiaries. Both have their uses, but I am quite sure fiat the amounit of good effected by the former vill be by far the greater.
As regards theiupper classes, I speak advisedly from a very large experience as a college tutor when I say that, although there are many lamentable instances in young men of those " criminal excesses" -which correspond to crimes in the lower orders, the amount of these deplorable facts has dimninished at the lUniversity with which I was closely, and amn still partially, coruiected, in the same proportion in which the mental cultivation of the students has increased. I will say more, that next to a strong religious feeling there is no security against a career of vice and extravagance at the University upon whiclh reliance is to be placed comparable to that which arises from the existence of a taste for literary and scientific attainments of whatever kind in the student. Even with reference only to the moral effects there is no reform which wvould produce so much benefit to the upper classes as for those great national institutions -the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge-not only to enlarge the platform of their studies, but to insist on a higher standard of preliminary cultivation in those whom they admit to prosecute them.

A FREE PAsRDON.-At the October Quarter Sessions, held in Preston, a young Iribhman, namced Patrick CookEon, who had been sent for trial froni the Town-haU
ere on a charge of being concerned in the assault and robbery of P'atrick Murray in that town on the 29th of August last, was sentenced to 12 months' imprisoninent in the House of Correction. A.t the examination an attempt was made to prove an nlibi on behalf of Cool;son ; but, as a shilling that was foumd upon hiin was positively sworn to by the prosecutor as bis money, the evidence for the ali,i failed to produce an impression on the minds of the magistrates, and Cookson, as already stated, was conmmiitted for tral. Since hiis conviction at the sessions, however, his friends, convinced of his innocence, have bee n unceasing in their endeavours to obtain a remlission of his sentence, and declarations to that effect were made before Mr. Ainsworth, one of the borough magistrates, who forwarded thein, together !with the coin identified by the prosecutor, to the Secretary ,kf State, by whomu they were tranomitted to Mr. T. B. J fidison, the Chairmiian of Quarter Seesions at Preston; and *the result of these efforrs will be seen in the fullo wing copy .ofr.-'etter received by Hr. Ainsworth:-

The Comet Of 1556.
THE COMET OF 1556.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-In a letter addressed to you in September last, with reference to the comet of 1556, l alluded
to the recent discovery of the original observations X of that body, or rather of the publications containing
the results of observation, by Paul Fabricius at I Vienna and by Joachim Hleller at Nuremberg, and I also mentioned th?a the reduction of these data and the investigation of their probable eflect npon the time of the comet's reappearance were in progress. Tle calculations have since been brought to a conclusion. The delay has partly arisen from the excessive trouble and difficulty attending the discussion of Heller's observations, which, although apparently consistent and carefully made, are feund upon closer examination to be sadly confused and uncertain, not to say, in several instances, crroneous. Hence it has resulted that, notwithstanding the outlay of a great amount of labour sipon the calculations and the application of the best modern methods of determining the orbit of a comet from a number of observations, modified in various ways to siuit this particular case, it is impossible to arrive at anything like a satisfactory or definite conclusion respecting the precise elements of the orbit at the time the comet was last visible, and thus it follows that there as an equal impossibility of ascertainiog the epoch of the next appearance within narrow limits. It would be useless to attempt to give an intelligible explanation of the various steps in these calculations within the compass of a letter, and I shall therefore content myself with stating here the general result to which they conduce. On one assumption as to the stars intended to be distinguished by Heller after the beginning of April, 1556, the inclination of the comet's orbit to the ecliptic may be brought down to 28° 50', with the place of perihelion in longitude 2740 25', reckoning from the equinox of date. On another hypothesis the inclination may be increased to 320 60', with the perihelion in 2770 56'-numbers agreeing pretty nearly with those originally given by Halley. The longitude of the ascending node varies in different orbits from 1 74 50' to 1750 25', and the distance of the comet from the sun in perihelion from 0 47 to 0 52. Admitting the identity of this comet with that of 1264, it would follow from the above that the re-appearance mav take place as early as the present year, or it may be delayed until 1861, according to the assumption we make respecting the stars of conparison in April. There is, consequently, no alternative but to keep a sharp look-out for the next fouror five winters, about the track of the comet, to insure observation if it retiurn, as expected. It is necessary to bear in mind that this comet can only be conspicuous when its perihelion passage falls between March and October. If the nearest approach to the sun were to take place in the winter months considerable vigilance may be required to prevent its escaping us altogether. I think it is not likely to do so at its anticipated visit. M. Leverrier informs me that the comet will be systematically sought for at the Imperial Observatory of Paris, where more than one of the assistant astronomers have already commenced a regular examination of the heavens. Intimation has also reached me that search will be made at the observatories of Vienna, Parma, Altona, Upsala, Durham, Ann Arbor (Michigan, United States), and other astronomical establishments, most of which are provided with telescopes of great power, and, I may add, that a formidable telescopic battery will be furnished by the numerous private observers of this and other countries.
Within the last few months more than one attempt has been made to throw doubt upon the supposed identity of the comet of 1556 with that of 1264, and, consequently, upon the probability of its reappearance about the time anticipated. A paper on the subject, by Ilr. Hock, of the Observatory at Leyden, appears in a recent number of the Astrovomis/le NachrichIen, and, as it is not at all unlikely that the conclusions there sought to be established, adverse to the identity of the comets, may be reproduced in popular scientific periodicals, I will trouble you with one or two remarks thereupon. I entirely differ from Mr. Hoek in the inferences to be drawn from the whole of the details that have descended to us with respect to the apparent track in the heavens of the comet of 1264. Two of the assumptions upon which he appears to lay much stress rest upon no better authority than that of one Friar Giles, of whom it may be truly said,
" Nihil tetigit quod non vitiavit."
I can confidently endorse the opinion expressed by M. Pingr6, the French cometographer of the last century, with reference to this writer, who, in his short statement descriptive of the course of the comet among the stars, contradicts himself more than once, and that in a manner which renders it at least doubtful whether he was competent to describe wlhat he saw. After an attentive consideration of Mr. Hoek's objections, I see no reason to change the opinion I have long held as to the identity of the comets of 1264 and 1556, the grounds for which I endeavoured to state as popularly as is consistent with the nature of the subject in a history of these comilets, published in 1848. 1 do not pretend to assert positively that the comets were the same, but I maintain there is a sufficient degree of probability in favour of their identity to justify the expenditure of time and trouble for the ensuing four or five years, that the question may be definitively settled, iustead of being left open to discussion during another period of three centuries.
I have been informed that Professor Carlini, of Milan, one of the most emineiit of the Italian astronomers, regards the relative physical appearance of the comets of 1264 and 1556 as opposed to the supposition of identity, or at least implies that a brilliant comet is not to be looked for, if that of 1506 should return at the eDoch expected. Of course, the brightness of this, as of most other comets, depends in a great measure upon the tmne of year at which the perihelion is passed, but with every deference to the above astronomer I doubt if the hittory of comets affords auy plausible foundation for the opinion he has advanced. I believe it will be found on examination that comets are usuaUy most conspicuous and exhibit the longest tails when they approach near the earth, or, at least, are favourably placed for observation after the perihelion; that it is the influence of the sun upon the matter composing these bodies, whatever it may be, whichi mainly contributes to render them objects of such imposing magnitude and brilliancy as they occasionally become, anid that if a comet approach near the earth some time before the perilelion there is not the same probability of its being a bright object in our heavens as under the former condition. Exceptions do occur, yet I think this view holds good as a general rule. In 1264 the comet did not approach the earth within 0 4 of her mean distance from the sun, while in 1556 it passed at less distance than 0O08, and yet in the former year it is described as far larger and brighter than in the latter. But here I woould remark that in 1264, it had passed the perihelion before the nearest approach to the earth, whereas in 1556, when in our vicinity, the perihelion passage was more than five Weeks distant, the minimum separation from the earth having occurred on March 12, and the perihelion on April 22. Again, I thiuk we are by no means justified in supposing that a comet may not recover at any appearance that degree of brilliancy which it may seem to have lost at the previous one. The history of the comet of H3aley exhibits great fluctuations in this respect.
Let me add one remark in conclusion. If the comet return as expected, there will be proof evident to ever one that the time and trouble ex-
pended upon it have not been throwrn away; but even in tl:e event of its non-appearance astronomers will at least have the consolation that no want of activity on their part has been shown with respect to a question of comsiderable interest, at the only period when it is poshible to obtain a satisfactory answer; that a problem which it is practicable to solve in our own time has not, through apathy, been left openi for the astronomers of the 22d eentury.
I remain, Sir, Your most obedient servant.

The Double Murder In Walworth.
TH1I DOUBLE AIURDER I WALWOBTH.
'YONFESSION OF THE PRISONER.
Yeste:.- . Mrs. Martha Bacon, the unfortunate w,m an | who has b. mn in custody since Tuesday, the 30th Of last month, or a charge of cutting the throats of her tw J children was again brought up from Horsemmonger-lane eaol for futrther examination at Lambeth Police- court.
At 3 o'clock, the other business of the 'Lourt having been disposed of, the prisoner was taken :,efore mr. ELIoorr, and, as on the former examinatio',is, was accommodated with a chair at the solicitors' tabble, and in ftont of the Bench.
Mr. Woodward, of the firm of Taylor, Collinson, *nd Woodward, solicitors, Bedford-place, was in attendance to 'ateh the case an the part of the accused and her husband.
Inspector Young, in reply to a question from the magistrate, said that, in reference to the 51.-note mentioned on the last examination, and which was the only one of four received by Bacon, the husband of the prisoner, which had not been traced, and which was supposed to be the one stolen from his house at the time of the murder, he had received some information, but was not in a position as yet to produce it. The information respecting it, however, enabled him (Mr. Young) to say that it had been passed awav by Bacon on the 1st of December, some four weeks before the murder or the alleged robbery took place.
Sergeant William Broad, 23 L, said,-I produce a silver Geneva watch, No. 32,798, which I received from a person named Davis, who told me that it had been picked up on the morning of the oth instant from the doorstep of the house No. 4, Elizabeth-street, Trafalgar-street, Walwortb, wrapped in a piece of paper. It was shown to Mr Bacon, who said he had no doubt it was his, and the one stolen. The number is the same as that which he gave of the missing watch, and the number also given by his brother in George.street, Northampton-square, from whom he said he had purchased it.
Mr. EL11TT.-Wlaen the watch was shoown to Bacon, did the person showing it mention where it had been oundi
Sergeant Broad.-No, Sir; he did not mention the street, but said it had been picked up at a doorway.
Mr. ELLIOTT.-HOW far is it from the house lately occupied by Bacon, and where the murder had been committed, to the place where the watch was found?
Sergeant Broad.-I should think about a quarter of a mile.
Inspector Young was here sworn, and said,-Since the last examination of the prisoner I have been to Stamford, in Lincolnshire, and with the kind assistance of 3fr. Read, the chief officer of the police of that place, have been engaged for the greater part of three days in prosecutinthe necessary inquiries in this case. Your worship wilf recollect the description which Mr. Bacon gave of the suit of clothes he alleged to have been stolen from his house, and bis saying that for 20 years Mr. Dixon, a tailor at Stamford, was the only person who had made clothes for him. I have seen Mr. Dixon, and he declares in the most positive manner that he had never made such a coat for Bacon as that which he described the greatcoat to be. I have learned from Mr. DLxon that Bacon, when in Stamford, about three weeks ago, had a conversation with him respecting his missing clothes, and said, II If the police find them, they won't know they are mine, as they have got no marks on them." Mr.Young, in conclusion, repeated the numerous and contradictory statements made by Bacon in reference to the alleged robbery, the deseciption of the property alleged to hsve been stolen, and his strange prevarication respecting the time he had last seen the money safe and inflicted the cut on his finger. The latter was very remarkable. Bacon first accounted for seeing the money-a 51.-note and two
sovereigns-safe before leaving home on the morning of X Monday, the 29th of December, by saying he had to go to a box in which it was placed to get a piece of cotton to apply to a wound on his finger, which he had cut in the act of " whittling" (cutting) a stick. When asked to show the cut, Bacon presented his left hand, and between the first and second joints of the first finger was a very deep as well as an extensive cut, extending nearly to the bone. The inspector remarked on the improbability of such a cut having been caused by the mere cutting of a stick, and he then gave a different version, saying that he did it while carving the dinner on the Snnday by the knife slipping. He was then asked how it was, if this last version was true, he did not get it dressed on the Sunday, and not leave it without drssing until the Monday morning, when, as he alleged, his wife sat up in the bed and tied the piece of cotton on. Bacon did not seem to relish this style of interrogatory, and did not return an answer to or make an observation on it, but turned the conversation to something else.
Bacon. who was present, was asked by the magistrate if he vished to make any observations on the statements of Inspector Young respecting the clothes and money which he alleged had been stolen from him, and respecting which he had given so many vague and contradictory statements. He replied that his mind had been so affected by the loss of his children that he might not have given the correct statements at aU timies, though it had alwavs been his wish to do so. It was his habit, he said, to keep the money he received from Mr. Atter, his attorney at Stamford, by itself, and not to mix it up with his other moneys. The former he always placed in a smaU fancy box, wvhich was kept in a workbox, and the latter he put into ajar. The workbox containing the 51.-note and the two sovereigns was placed on the drawers in his bedroom, which was the front room on the first floor, and he was sure it was safe when he left home on the Monday morning at 6 o'clock. He did not, he said, see his children on that morning, as they slept in a different room from his, but he saw his wife, spoke to and kissed her, and before leaving she tied the piece of cotton rag on his finger. The suit of clothes stolen, and which were his best, or Sunday clothes, and which he had worn on the day before, he had placed on the balusters in front of his bedroom, and they were there on his leaving home. It was his cnstom of a Sunday morning to see and put his money to rights, and on the Sunday morning, the 28th of December, between the hours of 9 and 10 o'clock, he saw the 51.- note and the two sovereigns safe, and this was the lasttime he actuallysaw them. On the Monday rmorning he had opened the outer box to get a piece of cotton rag, and, seeing the other (the second box) inside, he concluded all was safe. On the Sunday night. about ll o'clock, he wound up the watch now produced by Sergeant Broad, and placed it on the drawers.
Mr. ELLIOTT.-Did you take the time on the following morning from this watch?
Bacon.-No, Sir. I had a watch of my own, from which I took the time, and carried it with me. This watch belonged to my wife.
Mr. ELLIOTT.-HOW long might you have had the greatcoat you speak of as having been stolen ?
Bacon.-Well, it may be five or seven years. Bacon went on to say that on leaving home he left loose in a drawer two sovereigns, and his wife had money besides. These two sovereigns he found safe, and received from Mrs. Payne, his aunt, his wife's purse, containinghalf-a-sovereign and 5s. in silver. When further pressed about the clothes Bacon flatly contradicted himself by saying the missing clothes were not his best, though he had repeatedly stated the contrary, but added that his best clothes were locked up in his drawers.
This having concluded his statement, Mr. ELLIOTr, addressing the prisoner, asked if it was her wish to make any statement or say anything to the charge against her.
Cook (the gaoler).-The prisoner tells me, Sir, that she does not feel equal to the task of addressing you; but she has banded me this piece of paper, which she wishes your worship to read.
Mr. ELLIOTT (looking at the paper handed to him) said, " She wishes me to read this paper, does she ?"
Cook.-She does, Sir.
The most intense an-iety was here manifested on the countenance of every person in the crowded court, and all eyes were directed towards the bench, when Mr. ELLIOTT rose from his seat, and w,ith some emotion read aloud from the paper in his hand the following startling statement:-
*-Sir,-I must confess I am an innocent persoi, and he vhocommntted the dreadful deed is my huaband; and there was no money on the drawers. He took the little boy down stairs, put him in a chair, and there cut his throat. He then xwent ulps-airs and cut the ittle baby's throat.
M :n'rmsA SAcOOx."
It would be idle to attempt a description of the scene of horror which this fearful announcement of the " dreadful deed," as the unfortunate prisoner and mother described it in her own handwriting, and the guilt of the husband, produced on the minds and feelings of all present. A thrill of horror seemed to pass through the court, and a loud outburst of unmistakable disgust and horror followed. Bacon, who stood behind Mr. Woodward, instead of rmeeting the accusation by a declaration that he was not guilty, notwithstanding the aecusation of Isis wife, wiitten and signed by herself, recoiled at the cbarge, and would have fallen backwards had he not been supported by the front part of the dock which was inmmediately behind him. When the excitement had in some degree subsided,
Mr. ELLIOTT,' addressing Bacon, said,-Your statements respecting the alleged robbery have been so vague, prevaricating, and unsatisfactory, that not a person who has heard them can for a single moment believe that they contain a syllable of truth; and I, for my part, should have felt it to be ny duty, even in the absence of any such statement aS that just nown made, to order you into custody on suspicion of being a party to the dreadful murder of your infant children. You will now, however, be taken to the station-house and charged in the regular way with the crime
The prisoner was here taken charge of by Mr. Young,. anid escorted by a Posse Of cOnstAbles to the policestation adjoining the court. So strongly marked was the indignation sga'tnst Bacon, that 'had' he not been so well guiarded, violent hands would have been laid On him. In a short time after he was brought back to the court, and placed in the felons' dock on tYs, following charge :-Thomas Fuller Bacon, 15, Anglesea-street, Mile-end, with wilfully miurderig his two children, Edwin Fuller Bacon, aged two years and a-hialf, and Sarah Ann Bacon, aged 11 miontlhs, on the 29th of December, 1856, at the house~ No. 4, Fouracre-street, in the parish of

The prisoner, who is rather a slight man, of about 5 feet 6, and of insignificant appearance, and wvho seemed' mere composed, replied, hy the advice of Mr. Woodward, that he did not, and was remanded to a fuiture day.

North American Mail Steam Service.
NORTH AMBRICAN MAAIL STEAM SERVICE.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TThEES.
Sir,-Having just seen, in your issue of the 30th ult., the letter of the Hon. S. Cunard, in reply to the various letters which have appeared in your columns on the subject of the annual subsidy of 180,0001. sterling paid by the Imperial Government to the Cunard Company for the ocean mail steam service to North America, I shall feel obliged if you wiU afford me space for a brief reply thereto.
In doing so I would beg to assure Mr. Cumard that no one more highly than I do appreciates his eminent services in originating and carrying out his line of steamers. Their success and management are at once a source of benefit to the country and of pride to every British American. And I would further assure him that I have no "other particular object in view" in writing on the subject than to afford information of the changed circumstances of Canada by the completion of her railroads westward from Quebec, which, in my humble opinion, makes the St. Lawrence route the best and quickest for mails and passengers, not only to all parts of Canada, but also to all parts of the IUnited States.
In my letter of the 16th of September I stated that Quebec was 2,502 miles from Liverpool, Boston 2,790, and New York 2,980 miles; that a steamer ranning 10 miles per hour would arrive at Quebec from Liverpool (especially as one-third of the distance was in smooth water) in 29 hours less time than to Boston, and in 48 hours less time than to New York; and (there being railway connexion from Quebec with all parts of Canada and the United States) that the mails and passengers could reach Portland, Boston, New York, Chicago, N ew Orleans, or any other part of the States, in much lci- time by the way of the St. Lawrence than by the route at present followed by the Cunard Company to Boston and New York. If this statemaent be true, and if Canada has this geographical superiority by the St Lawrence, why should the trade and interests of the 'United States be promoted by the Imperial Government subsidizing a line of magnificent steamers to run to the United States ports, to the injury of Canadian trade and interests, while the better route of the St. Lawrence is totally neglected?
Air. Cunard has not attempted in his letter to grapple with this question, or to contradict any of the statements rcferred to in my letter, but defends the route to Boston and New York by reflections on the St. Lawrence and Portland routes, which on examination he wiU find it difficult to maintain.
Mr. Cunard says " that New York and Boston are large cities, are always accessible, and have great facilities for for. warding goods and mails to every part of Canada and throughout the United States." From this the inference wiU no doubt be drawn by parties unacquainted with the facts that equal facilities do not exist by the St. Lawrence route during navigation or from Portland in winter. Now there are two means of transport in America-one by in terior navigation. and the other by railroad. At Boston the only means of transport into the interior is by railroad. At Portland (110 miles nearer England) the only means of transport is also by railroad. At New York there is canal and river navigation during the summer months to Lakes Ontario and Erie, besides the transport by railroad to Canada and aU parts of the United States. At Quebec and Montreal there is also canal and river navigation for as long a period as from New York, and also railroad connexion with aU parts of the interior. But Quebec has the advantage of being 100 miles nearer to Toronto by railway than either New York or Boston, and is also nearer to New Orleans, St. Louis, Chicago, Detroit, &c. For the transport of goods by navigation the St. Lawrence is altogether superior to New York. In the one case goods seldom reach Lake Ontario from New York by canal under eight days, while on the St. Lawrence goods reach the same point by steamers from Mon. treal in 30 hours. So much for the superior facilities of Boston and NewYork, compared with the St. Law rence and Portland routes. But Mr. Cunard says that " Quebec is closed by ice and other dangers for six months." Now, this is a mistake, for sailing vessels usually arrive about the 20th of April, and are never away before the 25th of November. Indeed, there have been arrivals from sea on the 10th of April, while steamers have arrived at Montreal from Quebec on the 11th of December; and I have no doubt that when the railroad is extended to Trois Pistoles (154 miles below Quebec), instead of having seven months' navigation as at present (and notsix, as stated by Mr. Cunard), steamers from sea will be able to use the St. Lawrence for eight months.
Mr. Cunard further states " that Boston and New York were the ports in the United States first selected, and there are no good reasons for substituting Quebec and Portland," and "that the good people of Canada appear to suppose that the contract was made for their especial benefit and no other, but they are in error."
It will not, I think, be questioned that when the Cunard line of steamers was established, some 20 years ago, the great object in view by the Imperial Government, as publicly stated, was to insure a more direct and intimate com-munication between Boston and the North American colonies than hadpreviously existed. Boston for some years was the only United States' port to which the steamers sailed. When the contract was made, and for nine years and after, no British mails were allowed to pass through the United States. During this period the Canadian and other colonial mails were landed at Halifax. The Canada mails were sent overland, in winter, from Halifax to Quebec, and in summerfrom Pictou to Quebec by steamer, Dtring this period, also, no British or foreign goods could reach Canada through the United States in bond, as it was on1y in 1S48 that the United States Warehousing Act came into operation. Ulnder these circumstances, therefore, it is not probable that the Canadians could have made the mistake of supposing that the contract with the Cunard Company, for ocean mail steamers, was made for their especial benefit.
That the Cunard line of steamers have conferred advan. tages on the colonies by the increase and more rapid transport of the mails cannot be denied; but as no Canadian mails are now landed at Halifax, and but few goods imported s-id Boston and New York for Canada, it will not, I think, be questioned that the line is now more calculated to advance the trade and commerce of the United States than of the British American colonies. Canadians state that the subsidy paid by the Imperial Government for the Cunard line of steamers has the effect of attracting trade and of giving prominence to United States' ports ; and all that they ask is that either the subsidy should be entirely discontinued, or that during the continuance of existing contracts the Canadian line of steamers running to British ports in America should receive equal consideration from the Imperial Government with a line runnin- +, TThif.A

Cruelty On Board American Ships.-
ORrELTY oN BOARD AxERICAN SHIPS. - Killing is evidently considered " no murder" on board American ships. We have a fresh proof of this, on an average, about every other week. Last week we had the case of a man beaten, kicked, cuffed, or flogged to death during a voyage across the Atlantic in the Gny Mannering, simply because the poor fellow, though on board a ship professedly as a seaman, did not happen to be a thorough sailor. This weekvve have a "mutiny"on board the James L. Bogart, while lying in the river, and half a dozen men shot, stabbed, hacked, cut, or beaten, if not to death, at least to such a condition that it may well be denominated " death'e door." From all this it will be seen wvhat is the fearful condition of life on board American vessels, for the sailors at least. In the American service tyranny and brutality appear to have become the rale; in the British service we know it is the exception. Now, how is this? American seamnen have proved themiiselves to be as brave, and American officers, when they are among us, are quite as courteous, polite, well educated, and apparently amiable, as Englishmen. Our owvn sailors are just as reckless on shore, as fond of rollicking, as heedless of crimps, and as much addicted to going on board drunk at the very moment the vessel is leaving dock, as the Americans are; yet we seldom hear of snch outbreaks among them on shipboard, or of our officers finding it necessary to fly to such dread resorts as their Americau brethren are notoriously in the habit of doing. There must be a reason for this difference. and there is. Tbo American ships arc undermanned compared with British ships; hence the attempt to get more work out of the crews than they can reasonably accomplish tends to all these deplorable coings. This is' no mere theory-it is an absolate fact, proved by American official docuuments. From the figures two facts are apparent - first, that although the tonnage of the Amencan ships almost exactly coubles that of the English vessels, their crews altogether number not quite one-third more than the whole of the crews of the English ships; and secondly, that thciAmerican commercial marine is not recruited from the same trustworthy source as our own,-namely, from apprentices, or $-boys," as they are denominated in the roturns. 'ow, this undermanning of American vessels is a most important question, and should engage the serious attenition of statesmen both in England and America. Nationally we have the greatest interest in securing efficient discipline and good order on board American ships, for how many thousands of our countrymen and countrywomen annually intrust themselves to their care as a means of conveyance to what they anticipate will be to them a happier and a better country ? The underwriters, we may be sure, will look after the matter so far asthey are concerned, for they know wellenough that ships short-handed are not so seaworthy, however well bailt as ships with full and able crews. The Americans will no doubt look after it for the credit of their comutry, aS the present diEgraceful state of things must be, we feel assured, as much deplored on theother side 9f the Atlantic as itis on $hIs,-bW-F2qoo°I Couri(fr

THE STATE OF NEWGATE.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Domestic affliction prevents my attendance at the Court of Aldermen, but I am much interested in the statements made in your journal as to the condition of this, as it may with propriety be termed, national prison.
For the last 14 years I have striven earnestly to convince my brethren of its entirely defective construction, and its consequent contaminating influence on the many prisoners from year to year confined within its walls.
I observe that much importance is attached in the Court of Aldermen to certain suggestions emanating from a committee of the court "appointed 1S months ago to inquire into the state of the gaol of Newgate." Asthis committee was appointed on my motion, I beg permission to say a few words on. the subject.
The committee were unanimous in their condemnation of the structural arrangements of Newgate, which neither admit of separation or a proper classification of its inmates, nor of any adequate supervision by the officers of the prison.
But the suggestion I made to the committee to at once remove Newgate and to consolidate this prison with the other city prison at Holloway, was negatived.
The plan now before the Court is to alter Newgate at an enormous cost to admit of the " separate system." I do not object, but heartily approve of the separate system in prison discipline; but there are great objections in continuing the gaol of Newgate on its present site. In the first place, its area being only half an acre is much too smad for adaptg it to a prison on the separate principle. But why have a prison in the very heart of the metropolis, where the value of land may he estimated at 100,000. per acre, and which, to carry out any well devised plan of discipline, would require several acres ?
But, Sir, the state of Newgate is not the only defect of magisterial management within the city. The Central Criminal Courts are by no means suited for the important trials which are from time to time arranged to take lace within them. The wretched accommodation provided for the grand jury, as well as the entire absence of waiting-rooms or the numerous witnesses summoned to be in attendance, are crying evils, and have formed the subject of presentments from the grand juries, and have elicited lond condemnations from many others.
As one most desirous to see the institutions of my country and more e pecially those in connexion with the city of London, placed on the best possible footing, I am truly rejoiced to find that the state of Newgate is reviewed so ably by correspondents in the columns of your powerful journal, and I seriously and fervently hope that no endeavour to bolster up and perpetuate this " don of devilry" will be successful, as I verily believe that the contamination contracted within its walls has done mole to increase crime, and to multiply criminals than any other cause within my knowledge. I sir-

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TITUES.
Sir,-I am able to corroborate the evidenco of the police and also the statement of Mr. W. Mason, by saying that I have witnessed more than once many people crowded together before the door of St. Luke's workhouse, who were unable to gain admission, and who complained to me, on my pUtting questions to them at the time, of their wretched plight.
I have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant.

A FIGHT WITH THE POLICE.-In consequence of
A FiGrHT wITH THrS POLICE.-In consequence of information received by Mr. Hughes, superintendent of the D division, at Marylebone-lane station, that several burglaries had lately been committed at Notting-hill and its vicinity, he on Tuesday night directed Sergeant Potter, of the same division, with Parsons, 182 D, active officers of the division, who were in plain clothes, with several other police constables, who were in uniform, to proceed to the locality, for the purpose of endeavouriog to apprehend the burlars. Upon the arrival of this force at the spot it was arranged that it should proceed to Westbourne.-gark oead and Villas, and constables were stationed in the rear of several of the houses there. About 3 o'clock the rattle of one of the constables was heard, this officer having seen two men get over a wall in the rear of the house, No.
, Westbourne-park-villas. The officer Spencer, 35, went up to them, and was immediately assisted by Potter, Parsons, and three other constables; but one of the burglars, named Hughes, took out of his pocket a large iron pher, such as is used by gasfitters to remove screws from gaspipes. rle struck at the officer, who closed upon him, but, in doing so, Dobell, 247, received a blow which knocked him down. The burglar was eventually secured and taken to the stationhouse. Near where the struggle took place a screwdriver, a large pocketknife, two wax candles, and some lucifer matches were picked up, which there is no doubt were flung away by Hughes. The companion of Hughes, while this affray was going on sprang over the wall. He was followed by Parsons and a constable named Soar. He swore that he would not be taken alive. Soar, however, laid hold of him, when he was overpowered. At the stationhouse some lucifer matches and wax candles were found on him. Much alarm was caused duriug the affray. Many gentlemen got up and, halfdressed, came out of their houses and fired off pistols, to the danger of the police. One gentleman, who had a lifepreserver, was about to strike Parsons, 182 D, who was in plain clothes, as he was getting over a wall. In conseluence of the many burglaries the proprietors of the housesinthat locality are armed with revolvers.-Globc.
