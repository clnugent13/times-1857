This she refused; ad eConsequently she deprived herself of all ight of beingrepresented at the Conferences, of 'which the- issue might be war. It may then, befairlyinferred. frun the in- vitation addressed to Prussia, that no. danger now exists of -her incuriing, any obligationa-t_hat the consequences need no longer be apprehenad_thaii the causes for the continnancnce of war are removed-. and that, in a word, Russia hess accepted al. that we have asLed. I' 'eonss 'I calm arive at no other conclusion, unless,- what is highly improbable, Prussia has at last manifested a certain amount of spirit, has' grown ashamed of her past conduct, and determined to act even now as at independent nation. It must be admitted that the invitation to Prussia at sneh a moment is not ve y flattering to her antour-proe if she still has any There may have been instaces where Government3 were asked to come and aflix their signatures to' treaties made without their paricipation-but theywere Governments of a second or third 'order, t3 which Prussia, by her own aet, has now reduced herself. Itis like the off-ha ndsort of invitation addresseit to an acquaintancewhose society you do not set much value on, to drop in if he has nothing better to do andutakecoffee where more honoured guestshavai dined. 'Vhether he accepts or not does not much matter. This sort of invitation, of which the loo e; familiarity borders on indifference, if nlot contempt; is per-aps more higlhting-han if-thepxarty who thus serves as a cure-dent were forgotten altogether_ Count Orloff, we are told, is the person who first spoke formally at the Conferences of inviting Prussia; and the ground he took was, that as aC modification was to be made in the Treaty of 1841, that is in the public law of Europe, it was necessary that all the Powers who had taken part in that act should be represented when a change was to ba made in it. When such secrecy is observed it is diffiecult to guarantee the authenticity of the reports in circulation about the Congress. But it is, never.. the]ess, said that Count Orloff has accepted all thoe, important points at issue-the neutralization of the, B3lack Sea and the Sea of Azoff, the transformation, of Nicholaieff into a purely commercial port, the non-reconstruction of the demolished fortresses on the. eastern coast of the Euxine from Yenikale to Batoum, and the suppression for all military purposes of any others, the admission of Consuls, &c. It is true that, if any Credit can be attached to the same reports, Count Orloff refusea positively the application of a similar measure to thet fortresses on the southern side of the Caucasus to the Caspiau Sea, as demanded by England. 'Whether such a demand was made I have not sufficient authority for stating, but the sort of check spoken of at the sitting of Saturday last is attributd in some quarters to that incident. I told you on Sunday last that much progress would be made this week in the Conferences, ani that the period of their duration would be shorter than was supposed in the beginning' The invitation to Prussia to send Plenipotentiaries tends to prove the accuracy of what I said. The fact; is, the Emperor is, from causes more than once referred to, anxious to finish the business, and the opinion is generally that we have very nearly, reached the conclusion. The Moniteur says "Accounts received direct from General Williams, tha defender of Kars, state that his health is almosb completelY established. He speaks highly of tho mannier in whicia General Ionravieff has treated him." General Baron Subervie, who was Minister o£ War under the Provisional Government, has just died at his chateau of Parenchere (Gironde), aged. 84. The deceased took part in all the wvars of tha Empire, and commanded the advanced guard at tha battle of Waterloo. The. following are the last billetins issueed relativea to Prince Jerome:- " 'MAuc 13, nAPx-rAsT 3 r.3I. "The first half of the day has passed over -without anyz aggravation in the symptoms."

A prologue, written by Lord Dunkelliun, was spoken by Lieutenant-Colonel the Ron. Percy Feilding . The theatre, though small in comparison to that on Catheart's-bill, was decorated in a manner which does the greatest credit to Lientenant-Colonel Thgginson and the Hon. G. Cadogan. The performance of the" Athletes" (a cue to whose names may be fouad on rending them backwards) was received with great appLause. lWotwithstanding a heavy fall of snow, the theatre wvas filled. L,ord B>okeby, General Barnard.- General Crawford, Colonel Morris, &c., were there.
v Tm D=UKE OF Rum AD.-A few days ago a deputation of the tenantry of the Duuke of Rutland waited upon his Grace at BelvoirCastle for the purpose of presenting to him his portrait, painted by his relative, Mr. Gratg R.A, as a token of the veneration and regard in which they held him as a landlord and an English gentleman. The ceremony of presentation took place in the library, when an appropriate address was read by Mr. Stone, one of the tenants, m which the tenantry aluded to the confidence existing between-them and his Grace, and acknowledged the high honour and advantage they enjoyedbylivingunder a nobleman sojustly distinguished for qualities which had rendered him a right examiple in social, public, and domestic life. The Dluke having expreased his great regret that the nature of his illness, affecting as it didtheorgansof his voice, precluded him from ing any observations, deputed Lord John Manners to read his reply. This document conveyed in feeling terms the Dulke's regard for his tenantry, and an assurance that the testimonial should be preserved ags a heirloom in the castle. Lord Granby, who was suffering most severely from the effects of a fall when bunting, left his bed to be present during the proceedings, but was obliged immediately afterwards to retire. There were present also Lord John Manners, Lord Jermyn, Lord Forester, Mr. Drammond and Lady Eliza Drummond, Rev. -F. and Lady Adeliza Norman, Lady Elizabeth Hervey, Lieutenant Drummond, Rev. AL 0. Norman, Rev. P. Mfules, Mr. Grant, Mr. Schetkey, Dr. Parsons, the children of Lady Adeliza Norman and Lord John Manners, and several of the tenantry. The portrait, an excellent likeness, represents the Dake in a sitting posture. In the evening the deputation of the tenantry dined at the castle with the Duke's famaily and guests.

IRBLAND. TH TIPPERARY BANK. fFROM 01=7 O'wr. I - , I ; DUTBLIN. -RIDAY iOdRN?W. I The Waf4ord Mail, speaking on'behalf of the 1 Canick shareholders and depositors in the unfortdnate Tipperary Bank, insists upon a searching inqoiry with respect to the as yet wholly unaccounted for deficiency of 300,0001. For thib frightful defalcation no explanation has so far been even attempted : . - - "It apprs (says the Afil) thit there Ws an attenpt. to iake thigs snug before the crash, for we fnd that it was before the 31st of December, 13855--ark the date-that Mr. Vincent Scully and Mr. Wilson. EKennedy ceased to. be directors. Poor fellows they were in happy ignorance of what was coming when they tried to slip their heads out of the noose. Are we to believe they knew nothing abouit these things? We aretold'twasaUMr:.JohnSadeisdjiigs;i but, while we have the glaring fact that, in addition to thoe 200,0001. which John Sadleir got, some of the other,con- isprators have made away witht the still lrger sum ofj 0,0001., we ask,-who got it? Where was it put? and who has it? e wait for an answer." A long list of aspirnts for the offices of manager and solicitor for winding up the affairs of the -bankwas lodged yesterday in the Mast ofice, but the appointments will not be declared until Satirday.- Among those proposed for official manager are xr. George MZDowell, one of the junior ellows of Trinit y College; Mr. Francis Codd, of the corporation; and Alderan John lReynolds. ?~W ROSS ELlCTOl. The nomination takes place to-day, and the tolling on MIonday. The struggle will be a close one, aud it is probable that the choice will be left to the decision of the Roman Catholic party aloiie, as the few Conservative electors in the borough take no interest in the result. MIr. Tottenham, the -qnUiDerbyie,goesarbevondSirThe4mas 3~d~gto.ilhii professions of liberality, and is prepared to vote for tenant right, according to the League interpretation of the principle ; the continuance of the Xaynooth< grant, the sacredness of the nunneries, and, in' order wholly to eelipse his rival's pretensions; the repeal of the Ecclesiastical Titles Act-a measure which was tacitly approved by his opponeent, who continued t4 hold, office under the ussell Governraent up to its dissolution in 1852. Tn IRISH JUIDICIAL B3WCH. The members of the Rome Bar, assembled at Naas, the last town on the circuit, have presented' an address to the Lord Chief Justice expressive of their continued admiration and esteem of his high legal abilities, and adding that they view with pride the same clear discernment inx the administration of justice, and the same undimnis9hed energy and dignity of character which aave always commnanded. the respect of the bar. his Lordship, who was deeply affected, returnied a suiitable reply. ATIrT TO ASSASSurTE. 9The Belfast Whig of yesterday contains the following " We are informed that Mr. William Wight,a gentleman engaged in the tea trade in this town, and who resides at the Moat-house, between Belfast and Holywood, formerly occupied by Mr. Thomas WClure, wa shot at in his' own avenue, on Sunday night list, with an airgun, the charge 'of which wounded him in one of his hands. On the following evening, slso, when returning home, he was fired at, and a ball struck the mnare he was riding in the ear, and afterwards passed through his |hat. Mr. Wighthas been liinug in hispresent residence, we I believe, for the last 12 months, an no cause can be assigned ;for these outrages against his life. He is at present out of town, but is espected to return at the close of the week. No doubt the Government wvill offer a reward for the apprehen. sion of the would-be assasins."

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIZES. Sir,-I shall be obiiged by your inserting in your paper the enclosed letter in correction of a part of the correspondence you have already published on this subject. I have the honour to be, Sir, Yoars obedientlv. W. E FREDERICK CAVENDISH. Burlington-gardens, March 14. TO IuT.uNr-G aTrEN-Rx A Sm D IDP cy EvA&?s, G.C.B. Sir,-I hope you will excuse my again troubling you with a few lines on the Court of Iuquiry in 1853.- I last night received a communication from MajorGeneral SirCharlesYorke stating that Major-General Hall had applied to the Field-Mar8hal Commanding-in-Chief with reference to a passage in my letter to you of the 4th inst. stating that the Field-RIarshal Commanding-in-Chief had recommended my father " to treat the author of the accusation with contempt," &c., that the Field-Marshal Cornmanding-in:-Chief rnost unquestionably denies havnDg recommended such a course, and, further, that I had not mentioned on what authority I had made that statement. Before I wrote to you on the 4th I referred to the correspondence between mny father and the Horse Guards in 1853, and I found the concluding paragraph in a lett3r from my father to Lord Hardinge, dated August 13, 1853, thus worded:- " Henceforth I shall .endeavour, in accordance with your Lordship's recommendation, to regard the accusation, unless it is revived, with indifference, and to treat the author of it and his supporters, -with the contempt which their despi cable conduct deserves." The answer to that letter, dated the 36th, from the 3ilitary Secretary, states "I have the honour, by direction of the General Comn manding-in-Chief, to acknowledge the receipt of the letter which you addressed to his Lordship on the 13th inst., and to acquant you that, after the opinion of the Comut of Inquiry which investigated the subject matter between you and Colonel Hall, of the 1st Life Guards, and the expression of Her Majesty's gracious fvour in appointing you inmediately after the close of its proceedings to the Colonelcy of the 2d Dragoon Guards, Lord Viscount Hardinge considers that you could not act more judiciously than by following the course his Lordship has always recommended for your adoption." This was the authority I made the statement upon, independently of what had been often urged by word of miouth, but I believe, in consequence of the Commander-in-Chiefs denial, that I drew a wrong inference from the foregaoing letter, and that his Lordship intended such a recommendation to attach to the accusation, rather than those concerned mint. I have the honour to be, Sir, Yours obediently, W. H. FREDERICK C.VENDISE. Burlington-gardens, March 14.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMS. Sir,-Allow a humble individual, 'who has had many opportunities of fonning a judgment of his character, toadd a few words -with regard to Mr. Smith O'Brien. I filled the not very enviable position of Government reporter during the so-caled rebellion and State trials in Ireland. This would have been a most dangerous post but for the care and consideration of itr. Smith O'Brien. At all times he treated me 'with the 'greatest kindness, and Ibelieve it was owingto his interference that Ifrequentlyescaped from personal insult and injury. When any such subject was proposed he manfully withstood it, and threatened to withdraw from his then associates if any harm happened to me. He stated publicly that he had implicit reliance on my reports. I believe him to be a most merciful, 'honourable, although mistaken gentleman. I am sure all danger to Ireland through his influence is past and gone. The Irish Poor Law, and the improved agriculture under the Encumbered Estates Act, have conclusively settled that question. The truth is, there never 'was any fear for Ireland after his own people stoned him at limerick, when he very nearly lost his life in trying to save those around him. The only penalty I would attach to his return would be, ihat he should reside in England, that he may know us better. I am. Sir. vours obeclientlv. J. G;HEODGES.

T-ALBOS DiYORCE. I RouSE OF, LOiT)a"- V'-~I The barling of the evidence&in this can3e was resmuned' this morning athalf-past 10 o'clock. Maria Mooney recalled and eixamined bV Lord St. iEo.NArt's.-In taking the four bottles of winemto Mflaun's roora I broke two of them. Tn going and 'returning X- wa not seen by the other servants.. I broke tne bottles on- the stairs going9up to Mulla's reom. I don't 'know what sort of' wine it was. I don't know whet'her it was home-made wino or port wine. I threw the broken glars down the watereloset. I wiped, up.the wine. with-my apron, and: thea threw my apron down- the watereloset. My object in gett gridof thewinethat was spilt and the broken gla 'was thatnobodysihouldsceit. Idesiredtoreonaeilwhatmy,mistreas had done. My nmistress knwe that I had broken the winebottles the next morning. Idid not mention it totheother servants because Ididzot wish theni to know it. I andthe. lady's-raid were on very good terms, in the habit of talk. ingtogether. We did not always sit in the same room. She sat in the housekeepers-room, audI sat,in the servants'halL I never told her what I have told the House. It was never a topic of conversation-between myself and her about Mfrs. Talbot andWilliam. Imade up some shirts forhim by mny miste'ws-desire. They were mastefs shirts, altered for William rs. Talbot found fault with them. I was very much shocked when I saw what I told the Rouse. I. went up agai shortly xfterwards. I was not gOing agan to tit room. I had a candle with mue the second timne. I did. not notice whether oxz not Williambad the second time I saw him. I did-not look at him particularly. I did 'not speak to him. I was on goodterms with himi. I was in the habit of talking with hi but We had no conversation upon this matter. He did not knot that Ikne ianything aboutfit. I don't knowwhiether my moistreassaaw me, but the next morning she scolded mae for disobeying her orders. She did not say what orders. I gave her warning on the day following. I told my feUow servants that I and myhusbaid were going to America,'and that I wanted to get home as fast as I could. Master and Mullan hadhad a quarrel that morning and we were speakir about it in the lktchen. By MrX. Se1jeAnt1EZLRs.-Mullau brought the party back from dinner. The reason I went upstairs at' first was becau5e Iw aqske4 totell MIuan that lie wold be too late to take the carriage for them. B Mr. Emwi5 JEm*-My husband and I were not realygoing to Atnerica,-but I said so as an apology for leaving. I know a man of the name of Qairk. I did not tell himn that the reason Idid not go to America was because I could not get any money from Mrs. Talbot. Idid not tell Quirk thatthereports against Mrs. Talbot were false. I never saw him at-Kelly's beershop. I have said to 20 People tbat there was not a word of trt&th in the reports, and told tbem not to mind and not to give into them at all. I will swear thatI did not-fferto be sworn ona It.-note that the reports were false. I have told the People about that there was no trath in them-why should I do otherwise? I gave warning two days after seeing them in the bedroom, and yet after that I told people there was no truth in the reports. Rev. Mr. Morris Collis.-I am a benefieed clergyman of tlle church of England. I reside at Fermoy-hall county0 Cork. I know Mrs. Kenrick. I heard something from her in November, 1851., about ifrs.Talbot. I had been ill before that time, I heard -what I did through my wife. I saw ss Williamson myself. In consequence of what I heard from my wifc I connunicated with Mrs. Crosbie. I made a communication to the father of Mrs. Talbot. Mr. Crosbie was Mr. Talbots brother. This proceeding was not made known to Mrs. Talbot. I met Mr. WCausland at Belfast. An obecti being taken to any examination as to what took place between the lady's father and Mr. Crosbie, Thi OtDSHn& keld ,the atysfte deue. LORDSEIIPS held that at present it was not legal evidence. Bridget Queeney.-I was in the service of Mr. and Mrs. Talbot. 'I weht therein the November after they went -to Mount Talbot. I know Mullan. I have seen Mrs. Talbot going into his bedroom. I saw that twice. He was in the room at the time. I heard them talking together in the room. When m Talbot went to Mullan's room the child went with her. There was a carpenter's workshop near. I was sent by Mrs. Talbot to take the child to the workshop, where a wheelbarrow was being made for her. I did not go back until Mrs. Talbot came to call me. I used to go to a stable where I had some pet lambs, and Mrs. Talbot would come and say that it vas timefor me to go to my business. There was only one flight of stairs to go up to Mullan's room. There was a celhing. Iwas laundress there. It was part of my duty to washMullan's shirts. Mrs. Talbot sent a housemaid tome about the shirts. Mrs. Talbot asked me why Mullan's shirts were not done better ? She made me wash them over again. Cross-examinecL-Mullan was the coachman. I left in April or May. There were other rooms leading out of the passage to MuIlan's room. Those were servant's rooms. have been in Mullan's room. There was a iire there. MIy mistress sent me to see if it was Nvell done up. Inever saw her go to anybody's else room to see if it was clean. r. :Hill Smith, a surveyor, produced a-plan of the house at Mount Talbot, and explained it to their Lordships. He had tried it with the surveyor on the other side, and found that they could hear persons talking in Mullan's room from the laundry, but could not distinguish what they said. Bridget Queeny recalled and cross-examined.-I was dismissed from the servioe of the Talbots because they didnot like the butter I made in the dai. I never heard that Ibad been charged with taking things from the house to wvas a sawyer upon the premises of Mount Talbot in 1851. Was top savryer. The undersawyer was Patrick Doogan There was a grand stable anda hack stable. lKnew 3Mullan. Saw him oomin from the hack to thegrandstable. He had a rope over his arm. Saw M Talbot coming out of the archway and go into the grand stable. She came out again and went into the hack stable. There was a wal between the sawpit and the grand stable. He and the other man went to the hack stable. There was a window in it. Thev looked through the window and saw Mrs. Talbot and fmuUan lying down together. There was straw in the stall where they were lying. Witness and Doogan then went away. Cross-examined.-The first time he made this statement was -when M1r. Smith, Mr. Adai's clerk, came down to Mount Talbot. That was some time ago-about three or four years. Was sent up as a witness to DTiblin by Mr. Talbot. Mr. Adair tried him in his ofrice. He had not seen Mr. Talbot about it. Finnerty, the steward, asked him about it. Smith was the first person he had ever told it to. He was a married man, but he had never told his wi!e. Smith came down to Mount Talbot, and called him in, said he was a lawyer, and examined him about the matter. He recollected Mr Talbot leaving the house in May, 18i2. Re was working at that time for Mr. Talbot. Ee could not say how many months or years after that hie gave this account to Smith. lKnew Haoran and linnerty, but did not tell them anything until he had told Smith. Smith took down his statement, and that of Doogan at the same time. There were no horses in the stable at that time. Ms. Talbot had a riding El=se. It was kept in the grand stable. It o- curred between 2 and 3 o'clock. He could not remember whether he had seen Mr. Talbot that day. Mfrs. Talbot had frequently been into the stable where her horse-was. She did not remain in that stable manyniinutes. He did not see Mr Talbot riding that day on horsesback. She had on a dark dress and a long dark shawl. She had not a riding habit on. IRe had naever seen Mrs. Talbot ride. Mullan went into the back stable before Mrs. Talbot did. Directly Mrs. Talbot went into the hack stable, he and Doogan went to the ashpit to look into the stable. The asp it was 10 or 12 steps from the window in the stable. He went to the ashpit to put a coal on his pipe to prevent it being seen. Doo"an did the same. They then went direct to the stalie window after having done that. There were no horses in the stable. There were six stalls. He did not wait to see them come out-he did not know how long they stayed. Be and Doogan then went into the carpenters shop. He could not see the door of the stable from the carpenter's shop. He did not watch to see them come out. He knew that in May, 1852, Mrs. Talbot was charged with adultery, and yet he did not say a word about what he had seen. Re had worked for Mr. Talbot down to about siX weeks ago. Efe was on the preamises on the very day that Mrs. Talbot left Mount Talbot. He could not say whether or not he had ever breathed a single word of this to any human being before April, 1853. The first timo was when he spoke to Smith. Re-examined.-Smce this charge against Mrs. Talbot he had.been to America. By the Rousm--e did not know what year he went to America. He returned in September last and paid his own expenses. Eewent to America after giving his evidence toi&r. Adair. He did not go before ajudge. Re was in America two years. Re did not tell the persons engaged on this matter that he was going to America. Re came back on aceount of -his health. PatrickDoogan said,hewasanunder-sawyer. Rerecollected being one day at the sawpit with Patrick Corr. Re saw Mullan on that day. Re recollected Mrs. -Talbot going away, and the transaction he was about to mention occurred the July before that. Mullan had- a roge in his hand. He saw Mrs. Talbot go to the grand stable, and after stayingfor some short time she went to the 'hack stable. iRe ana Corr went to the ashpit. (The witness then went on to corroborate the evidence of Patrick Corr.) - - P Cross-exanined.--The window had wooden bars across it. Some of those being broken away enabled persons to see through it. Two stalls could be seen from the window. Re only stopped a second to look in. They seemed to be lying in te stal nearest to the window. He could not say how Mrs. Talbot was dressed.' She had a bonnet and shawl on. Corr first suggested to follow them. Re said they had met before in the stable, and that Ms. Talbot was on that design then. He had not told his wife of this. He had first told Halloran of it. That ewas after the first triaL Halloran had "knocked" -it out of him. He did not tell Halloran what they had seen, but simply that he knew something about it. He had a conversation with Martin Carrick. Re did not recolleettelling him that he had given . statement inDublin, but he would not swear to it. Re had not done so. He did not say that he would not have given that statement if M£r. Talbot had not been in the room. Ie -would swear that the signature to that paper was not in his handwriti1q. He could not wrte so well as that. Re would not swear it was not his writing, but it was not his writing. - By the Housm-He did not sign anypaper in the presence of Carrick. He did not recollect Carrick making a statement in writing and getting him to sign it. Re could only read writing badly. %ad never either seen or read that paper before. Re had never signed a paper simlar to that. Re had signed one for Mr. Tabot. Lord ST. LIoNRDs.-Is that paper in the house now , - Mr. Serjeant BYLEs.-No; we have not got it. - Bythe LoRD CEiAmLLoR.-Ispellmyname "Doogan." The witness then signed his name at the request of their lordships. - --By the HousE.-He never signed his name with a mark.: Re did not keep his owvn accounts.- By Mr. JAMrES.-Corr and he used to talk it over. le-examined.-Carrick had an under-agency at 3Mount Talbot. Hehad employed him one day to set up stalls. Carrick gave him a glass of spirits. Hew-as a little drenkhe was pretty hearty. He w-as able to wvalk home after- waids. .While 'drining* they -were taldng- .abo6t Mrs. .Talbot. If that paper -was ever. eridhited to 'himA wias when he was drunk Mr. Talbot did not say that if he did not prove that his evidenc would be worth nothing.

Dr. Walsh said, he was a physicin Was not acquainted with Mr. Talbot. l3aw Mrs. Talbot 'pro tess;llgat Cofiie ' Hotel, in Dublin. Had -been e in practice for some years. Had first seen Mrs. Talbot - on the 24th of May, 1852. She had on that- occasion a -hot slin and a quick pulse, and he prescribed for that state of things. Vsited her next oan the 27th, when he found that the remedies he had pre-' scribed had been beneficial. The 'first .symptoms had all subsided. Saw her again on the 30th. She ws much improved. Saw her for the last time on the 31st, when he thought she was so far recovered that he discontinued attending her. Did not remark any mental derangement in her, or anything approaching to it. She was in a great state of excitement. There were no delusions, After she had taken the medicine she oonversed freely with him, but not before. Was awith her the first time for halfan-hour, and on subseqouent visits from half-an-hour to an hour. There were decidedly no symptoms of innity. Cross-examined.--I never spoke about the particular charges which-had been made againt her. There was a servant of the name of Mary Armstrong. I never spoke to Mrs. Talbot about the particular charges against her. I know fr. Gage. reand I neverconsulted about sending n.rs Talbot to a lunatic asylum. I had some conversation about the charges on the last vist. I was sent by E. Adair on the part of the family. I Re-emined.-The first question Mrs. Talbot asked me on the last visit was whether she could see her child under the circumstances. She also askedmzeif she couldbe saved hereafter. By the HouSmE-She asked if I could give her sometbing to takeherout of the world. I hadheardthe circumstances audI did not Sake any ciment upon her request. I sent a nurse, Mxrs. Murray, by whom she as maost carcf Oly watched. The Rev. MLelan.-I.am the vicar of Mount Talbot. I knew the Talbot family in the summer of 1851. I frequently visited them and they appeared to live onvery good terms with each other.. I recollect 'the morning of the 20th of May, 1852. MY servant told me something very disaree. able had occurred at Mount Talbot. I went there about 1 clok. I went to the top of -the house, where I found Mrs. Talbot in art attic. Mr. Talbot had left the night before. I found her preparsig to leave. She was alone. 1 made a sort of excl"ation, and said, " Oh, m Talbot, what a sad lausiness this is." I went to upbraid her, but, when I came there my anger was turned to pity.- I don't recollect that she uttered a word. . I came dQwnstai. I remained in the house. I made arrangements for accompanying Mr Talbot to Dublin. I did that in consequence: of what I heard. Igot a carriage from Mtr. MIahon. Iaccompanieda her to Dublin. We went to Coffee's Hotel, -in Dominic-street, Dublin. Daring the time I was with her we had frequent conversations. She told me of her criminal intercourse. Shetold methat it commencedwith an act of fami-. linrity on his part. Their intimacy had continued from that period to the time when I had brougaht her awray. Shesipoke generally, not in detail, of her nufortumie, and she begged of me to tell Mr. Talbot: to mary end have a son. She told me she lived is. crimina'. intercourse wiith MuIlan, and had had counexion with him. She said "1 I live in criminal intercourse with William."I was a clergymau, and I was constantly impressing upon her the necessity of repenting of her crime and changing her ways. She did not tell me the first time she had intercourse with Mullan. I addressed her as a mnariedwoman who had'been guilty of adultery, and she never resented that. By :Lord BRouGnt.u.-I don't know that I used the word "adultery." I spoke of her having broken a particular commandment. By r. SzrrmL-She never denied it. I communicated I with her father on the day I brought her up. -Mary Armstrong came up to Dublin to her. I recollect a note being brought to me on the day after our arrival in Dablin. It was addressed to Mrs. Talbot. I rAd the contents and tore it. I then went downstairs and iaw Mullan and had a conversation with him. He made no inquiries of me. After this I told ;M - Talbot about the note. I told her that it was a note addressed to her by Mullan who was ait 15, Dominic-street. She begged that I would let ber see him and let her go away with him I said if she didIwould abandon her, and if I did nobody else would have anything to do with her. She heard me say to myself, " Can there be any extenuating ircumstances in this caseO" mad she raised her arms and said, "1 one whatever." She was in her right miand at the time. Cross-examined.-I never positively stated that it was a conspiracy of the servants. I might have said it was possible to be a conspiracy in consequence of what Mr. Paget said to me. I might have said to MIr. Gage that I hoped it was not a conspiracy got up by the servants. AsI don't think Mr. Gagewould forswear himself, I admnithaving said it. I don't recollect it. ByLordBRo0GHA.Md.-I did sayit. By Mr. Jsrrs.-It might have been after I took Mrs. Talbot to Dublin. I said the servants at Mrount Talbot were a bad set, but I was not justified in saying so. They iwere all kindness to Mrs. Talbot, but one of them was rude to me. This statement as to the servants was made months before I saw Mr. P'aget. When I knocked at the door of, Mount Talbot I saw a female servant. I also saw lalloran and linnerty there. Halloran was rnde to me, and I thinrk he must have been irinking. Finerty Awas not drunk. When I went into the room M1rs. Talbot did not endeavour to conceal herself. She said, "H ow lowI must have fallen when that man Halloran proposed for me to go away wvith him r' I did not know that lfr. Talbot had left her in the charge of Finnerty and Halloran. She did not tell me that Halloran had taken liberties with her on that night. I don't think she said more than I have stated. I don't re. collect that I stated to Mr. Talbot that Halloran had proposed to go away with Mrs. Talbot. I might have done so. Halloran was kept in the service of Mr. Talbot after this. I may have stated to Mr. Gage that Halloran proposed going away with her. I told it to 20 people. I did not tell XT. (e that on the night of the 20th Halloran, the butler, came to her bed and attempted to violate her. I viewed with horror the state. rment of Mr Talbot, that Halloran had asked her to go away with him. By the Houvs.-I frequently saw Mr. Talbot after this. -It never occurred to me to speal to Mr. Talbot of the impropriety of keeping in his service a man vwho had asked his 'wife to runt away witth him. By Mr. JAars5.-I never-was in the habit of gomg to the house frequently and being'waited ia by Hlioran. I have heard that MIr. Talbot has raised Ealloran's wages, but Mr. Talbot himself never told me of it. I saw lalloran there for a considerable time afterwards. Mrs. Talbot said to me several times -when we were in Dublin, " Oh, Mhr. IPLelan, my brain is oan fire, and I am in heIL" I watched the window to prevent her throwing herself out. I'was with her until her friends came to her. Mr. Gage never suggested that she should be sent to a lunatic asylum. Finnerty was kept in the service. Re-examined.-I first saw Mlr. Paget a considerable time after. When I was with Mrs. Talbot she did not appear to have any delusions. When I said that I hoped it was not a conspiracy among the servants, it was because 3M. Gage had swrorn that Ihad said so. I havenorecollection at all of anythsing of the sort. The Rlev. Mr. Gage.-In the month dof May, 1852, I went to see Mrs. Talbot in consequence of a note from Mr. Adair. I saw Mrs. w'Caualand. I went on the 25th of that month, and saw Mrs. Talbot at Coffeee's HoteL I had Mrs. Talbot under my charge for three weeks. I engaged quiet retired lodgings at the south side of Dablin for her. I saw her onboard of the Holyheadboat when she came to England. She had her maid with her. I saw her twice at Coffee's Hotel and several times at her lodgings. At these interviews I spoke about Mullan. I did not mention him at Coffee's Hotel on account of her great excitement. When I first went into her room she was in -bed, and she jumped straight up in bed as if she was shot, - and 1, being used to see violent derangements, endeavoured to pacify her as well as I could. I asked her if it was too painful to her to tell me all about it ? I took up a form of prayer to her, containing a confession which I considered applicable, and she became quite tranquil after that. The next day I entered upon the subject. Iasked her if the act of criminal intercoursehad been comm:itted, and she said it had.' She said she fell, and then it became a habit. I said, "Do you mean to say that it became a habit between you and Mullan?" asnd she said, " Yes, they had committed it frequently." I remember asldng her if the idea had originated from-her ? She got very much excited and said, " Do you think so meanly of me as that5" I said, " Did he force your and she said, ":No." Cross-examined.-I am Mrs. Talbot's first cousin. I am also connected with Mr. Adair, Mr. Talbot's solicitor. Ihad seenMxr. Adairbefore I went toMrs. Talbot. Mir. MrCausland was a guest at Mr. Adair's at the time. Mr. IWCausland was very unwellat the time, butI don't think he was weak in his mind. I vent from Mr. Adair's to visit Mrs. Talbot. I went to see Mrs. Talbot under the impression that she 'was a fallen woman. She was extremely excited. I have had great experience in the demeanour of lunatics. I thought she was msane, or as little capable of aftending to business as if she were, the first time I went to. see her. I met Mr. 3PLelaa there. He appeared to have charge of her. I told him I wouldtakethe responsibility of her on myself. I saw Dr. Walsh that day. She-was tearing her hair. She was like an insane wvoman. I have seen persons inse much milder than she was. Persons insane frequently alternate between extreme quiet and extreme excitement. Out of five hours I could only get five minutes' consecutive conversation with her. Iengagedaprofesional nurseftoattendher. My reason for doing that, was because her own servant was quite worn out. I never left her alone. -I was apprehensive of her taking up a knife from the table, and injuring herself, and also of her throwing herself out of the window. I directed her to be treated as an insane person for safety's sake, for fear anything should happen. No discussion took place at Mr. Adair's house, as to wihat was to be done with her. There was a discussion somewhere about it, and I advised her to be sent to a place in Scotland to the sister of a matron of a iunatic asylum, who received only four persons-some of them lunatics, and some of them not. That lady had been accustomed to the management of deranged persons. I don't think she' would have received Mr Talbot in the state in which she was when I first saw her, but she might have done;so afterwards. I had been-Mrs. Talbot's minister for 14 years. IHer state of mnind was sucll as I could rely upon without any* other evidence. I believed the confession to be perfectly true. (A letter was here put into the witness's hand.)

Morley, as reported in your paLer of this date, and rely on your long-established impartiality to give publicity to our statement. Mr. Morley complains of the amount of our charge, and that the "bankrupt's books ba. been remarkably well kept ;" and further, " that an one of the bankrupt's numerous clerks would have been ga to preparehis accounts for 5R." - Now the facts are these:-The books had been outof Mr. Jelferies' possession upwards of eight months (pending anendeavour to wind up the estatewithout the intervention of the Court of Bankrptcy); they were considerablj in arzear when placed in our hands, and had not been balanced during the whole period of the partnership, commencing -October, 1852, and involving on us the necessity of invesigating the entire accounts to arrive at a correct result. Mfr. Jefferies can confirm this statement, as he.-as daily occupied with ?us during the preparation of the accolmta; and at was onlyv by close application we were enabled to have them prepared in timne for the meeting, Thereby ssying the estate the expense of an ad3oulrnment.

TTHE EYPESSzE OF A BARONETCY.-ATeturn moved& for by Mr. Guinness, ILP., shows how de rly cet dignj ties must be paid for in this country.

The Earl of SHAFTESBURY, in rising to bring mder the attention of the House the Twentieth Report of the Inspectors of Prisons, said that in these days, when so mach stir was being zaadeabout the reformation of prisoners, their 1orda*ip'boseuomndtOseetbAtouw prisors and reformatory institations were made as effective as -possible. It would, however, be found that, in many of these institutions, not onIy were the prisoners iniured in health by the defective L)S>-nrsiuigemaents, but that tbey were greatly demaoralized oyther OOdinenent. (near.) Tbe firEt report with which le wou;d trouble their lordships was the report of an intelligenct ispector, Xr. IMery, oR the ounty gaol and house of correctionat Brecon. Mr, Perry said :- "No steps whatevet have tbee taken to remedy the idemoraliing -evils or to avoid the habitual violations of the law vwhich have been so often alluaded to in my reports as ccurring in this prison from the veryinadequate cell ccom. unodation.

(Hear, hlear.)

The result had been to efect ant imense improvement in the State of the prisons in Scotland. The subject then dropped. TH)I LATE LORD TRURO. The Marquis of LANSDOWNE, who had a notice on the paper to call the attention of their lordships to a comnn- nication rotan Lady Truro, said, before the House separates for the holydays I wish to make a coamunaication which I am sureyour lordships will hear with satisfaction. it is a comminication from Lady Truro, the widow of a noble and learned lord who for several years presided in this house as Speaker and as Chancellor. I have received from this lady a letter, which with your lordships' permission I will read. It is in these terms "Efy dear lord,-Lord Truro lebt a library of law books, a collection made durng many years with great care. It smy wish, in honour of 7his memory, and m remembrance of his legal attainments, that this library shouId be preserved, and at thle ame time rendered useful to those who were familLar with his last labours. Allow me, therefore, to request yon to offer this libraryto the House of Lords, trusting that their lordships will, if they do me the honour to accept it, direct it to be placed so as most effectualy to serve the objects vhich I have in view." My lords, if I were asked-as, perhaps, it is naturalI should be-how it comes that this distinguished lady hs rmade me the chamnel by which this offier should be conveyed to the Hmoue, I can only say I must pvesume it is owing to the circumstance of may having been for several years the colleague of that distinguished, learned, and noble lord. During the time that he presided on the woolsack, in one sense, though not in the other, I was the leader in this house of those with whom he was politically connected, and in that capacity, I can do no otherwise than bear the strongest testimony to the great ty, to the great wisdom, to the great justice with which he presided in this house. (Hear, hear.) I may add also-because it is a point in his characterwvith which I was more particuliarly conversant-that it was with a great sense of justice he administered the patronage incidental to his high office, and vith careful diseTimination selected the perons to whom he was enabled to extend the favour of the Crown. (Cheers.) To that portion of his character I am as competent to speak as any man; but there is another portion, of which I can onl speak on the authority of others, and that is the portion which umdoubtedly gives the greatest value to the splendid donation which his widow is prepared to m7ake to this House (Hear, hear.) I believe I shaH be supported by the authority of afl 'who are most competent to iudge when I say, that from universal report, I have always heard that lord Truro, was both as a lawyer and as a judge, one of the most painstaking, one of the mnost conscientious, one of the most industrious men that ever haboue with a view to the interests of his clients while at the bar, and with a view to the still larger interests of public justice when sitting on the bench. (Cheers.) I allude to these qualities, weU knowing that I shall be borne out by the testimonyof those whose authority is much higher and whose opportunities of experience have been much greater thanmine- Itis onlywithin the last fewv days that an eminent lawvyer, -being examined before a comm,ittee- of your lordships' House, took the opportunity of saying that, having pract'ised before thelate Lord Truro, hle knewv no man more indriousor more imprtial than that noble and learned lord. (Hear, hear.) this bears particularly on the donation which is now made to this House, because, in addition to a very valuable and extensive law library of printed books, which Lady Truro is desirous to ulace at your lordships' disposal, I am informed that those boks are largely commented and noted upon in Lord Truro's hMS., thereby largely adding to the value of those workswhich are now about to find a place in. your lordsbipse library. Being persuaded that tlle testimony I have ventured to bear, though partly from the reflection of others, to the merits of Lord Truro, will neet with the universal concurrenceof your lordships, I shiall say no more, but sinply move that the subject of this letter be referred to your lordsbipse TLbray Committee for the purpose of carrying into effect lady Truro's Wishes and intentions. Lord LYNDHURST.-I cannot resist, my lords, taidng this opportunity of adding my thanks to those of the noble marqms to lady Trro, for the valuable donation sbe has nade us. I know very well that the late Lord Truro never spared any trouble or expense in completing his law library, and such a donation is, therefore, of value to us, inasmuch as the libraryof this House, though extensive, is very far from being perfect in that particular branch of learning. Nor can I allow this opportunity to pass, notwithstanding the eloquenteulogium passed on the late Uord Tiro bY the noble naruis, without saying a few words in reference to its object. That noble and leared lord was profoundly learned in the law. Re was a ripe and full scholar. But notwithstanding his extensive learning, in every case of any importance that came before him, whether .asa aadvocate at the bar or after he came to the bench, he always erployed, from a conscientious desire of performing .his strict uty in the relative position in which he stoodhe always employed, as the noble marquis has stated, the greatest care, the greatest attention, and the most unexainjled industry i investigating the case before ! hiu. (t,heers.) My lords, Lord 'Truro vas not educated for the bar. He begn life as a solicitor, but conscious of his powers, wit a prop?er and laudable ambition he felt desiro7s of leaving the inferior walk in -which he anoved for the superior walkof the profession. He was called 'to the bar, -and soon afteracquired great distinctioa not only lon the W esterm(imuit, which he attended, but also in Lo-. don. He hadone 'difficulty, and it was rather an extraordinary one to overcome, I had it fromn his own lips, that 12e had a great iupediment, which rendered it almost iropozssi'ue for hun to utter cer ords 'overcane that dilfficulty -with a pewseverance and in. genuity whi* corresponded with hischbracter. He formed a 'list- of those words which, was a verv comaprehensive one, and annexed to each word every synonym he could collect. Finding any word difficult to pronounce, he disissed it, andisubstituted a synonym with an address and eadiness so remarkable that it occasioned no interruption in the flow of his discourse; indeed, no one 'wouid hare discovered the change 'who had not been previously informed upon the subject. After a&oertain timetthe noble and learned lord was created a serjeant, whereby he was placed at the head of his circuit. anid also became the leader of the Court of Comraon Pleas. -From *hat -time he possessed indispatably the command both of Jis'cifc,it and of the Court of Common Pleas, and in eVery iniportanit ease to be investigated by either tribunal there 'was a competition among the parties interested in those s2itg who shoaldobtain the valuable advantaze of his assistance. In 1839, thinlh it was, he became golicitorGeneral, and one or two years afterwards he becaie Attorney-GeneraL I am told-for I was not a member of the Hoase at that time-that during the discussions upon -q`estions of law relating to a great constitutional principle, he was remnarkable for the clearness, the force, anll the extent of his learning. I remember the late Sir i;. sAPeel, who was perhaps as good a judge of merit as any axa, -spsesing to mae 4n more than one occasion the hgh opnhen tertained of the talents and attainments ofE Lord Truro as dislayed upon the occasion I have referred to, and re partiinlarlyas'to the manner in whiel Ietreated-A nost important question, so long agitated inx the other flouse, the-question of uivilege. W .he the late Lord Chiedf stice Tredal died Lord Truro wa raised to the bench of the Court of Common !PIeas, Qnd about four or fi:c e yeazs terds&he ttok his Fk pOn the woolsack in this houie; And tI ink I may venture to say, in conrma- tion of'w at s fallen from the noble marquis, that in presiding over a o art of -common law or a court of eq ty- withthepr Uice Aw'hich he w-is not wfamiliar as Wththtat of common. law--e 'isplayed the Vzeatest patience, the greatest acuteess ' intellect, the greatest impartiality, ever displayed by-aiy man in the adnaistiation of justice, and such were his care and circumspection in preparing the judgments he deliwered, toth at commonlw and in equity, that they have always Ibeen considered master leces of learnig (I aun detative disquisition. Mylorda, I may also speak. of idsinteestedness in pecuniary matters. WheAnengged iua;y great .case he woul ii stract hislerk not to accept anY Other bmerf, without rnerence to any - ecumary sdvaatsee to lhimsd6f until he bad made himsel naster of the Oompsc ed. uedions comprised irn the case 'n%ch he was considermig.

Earl GREY.-I rise to mention i circumntance in eonfirmation of what has faUlen fro the noble and learned lord as to the remarkable disinterestedness w-hich distinguBhed tie latelord Truro. The noble and leaned lord (Lyndhurst) has referred to the great pmins and ability displayed iii the other house by lord Traro upon the celebrated occasion of the question of privilege respectin thi rntingofpaers. I had the honoutr, as a memberofthat ouse, to we placed in the chair of the committee to which it was referred to consider the couse which the Rouse should follow, ad I can say that, although I was in the chair of the commnittee, the labour of conducting the investigation fell entirely upon Lord Truro, who devoted himself to the subject with an ability which it is impossible for me todefihbe; andItolduthetime,notbyiorsd T bt T have no reason to doubt the accuracy ef my informationthat in order to enable himl to devote his whole energies to that task of public utility for wbich he reoeived nio pecumnary remuneration, he returned a very large number of briefs vwhich had been before handed to lmn and which would have produced him considerable profit. I cannot but think that i. a devotion to a sense of pu'blic duty which very fewv men indeed would have displayed. {bear.) I thoughtit ws a ciroumatAnceso honourable to Lord Trzto thutiwhen the neble and leanedlordoppositenmetioned.the sabject I thought it was my duty to state it to the Rouse. The Earl of DEBRBY.-Itwould be a sinmple impertinence on my art f I'ere to add anything to what hbas been said or to glve any opinion upon the merits of the noble and learnea lord whose loss we so much deulore, after the statements we have heard from thosewho were better acquainted with thost merits than the humble individual who now addresses your lordships, and I only rise for the purpose of adverting for a moment to the siotion with which the noble marquis concluded his observations. Of course, there is not, there canmot be, any difference of opinion as to the eat nlue of and interest attaching to the gift which lady Truro has so gracefully and liberally offered to bestow upon the country; but the motion of the noble marquis was simply to refer the letter to the iUbrary Comtittee, for them to consider what measures should be adopted to carry out the wishes of the noble lady, and it occurred to me that it uight ap somewhat ungracious if, in making a motion of this description on such an occasion, theres noacknowledgment on thepart of the House of the feelings entertained by it. I only suppose the omission has arisen from some form of the Rouse with which I am unacquainted; but, if that be not the case, I think it is an onussion which should be suaplied, and that the acknowled"inents of the House should be conveyed to that distingished lady. If any forms exist which cannot be waved, then Ithink it should be known to be public that it is those forms which constitute the obstacle to the expression of those acknowledgments which might naturally be expected for a donation so valuable and so liberal. I *would only suggest, if my supposition be wrong, that the motion should be amended so as to convey those feelings of gratitude wrhich the RTouse must entetain for so graceful a donation. The Marquis of LANSDOW1E.-The reason why I did not propose to include in the motion any acknowledgment t lady Trro wus no that Iam am wareof Iay sitive l on the subject, nut because there is no precedent for such a course. It had occurred to me that the object would ba attained by expressing those acknowledgmeents in the report of the committee, which, upon presentation, could be adopted by the Rouse. At the sane time, I certainly see no reason whv a precedent should not be created in the present instance. No doubt sach an acknowledgment on the part of the Rouse would be gratifying to the feelings of Iady Truro, and Per. haps the motion might be worded so as to express that acknowledgment. Lord LYNDEMIURST.-I understand that the Library Comnittee exchange with the library at Paris and receive books from the United States, and if they cam exchange books in this way they can accept them as a gift. The Marcuis of LA.NSDOWNE.-Perhaps, after alL it wi be as well to leave the subject to the committee. Tley can hardly make any suggestion in their report without expresg to Lady Truro an aclnowledgment o. the gift, and that acknowledgment will, I dare say, be readily adopted by this House. (Rear, hear.) The motion was then agreed to. LET ED LIABILITY. Lord MOLNTRAGU, in moving for retuns connected with this subject, said that Parliavent was invited to consider two bills with regard to the law of partnership which hadbeen introduced into the other house. They were now approaching Easter, and he should like to know whether the Government would endeavour to induce this Rouse to pass those two bils in the same manner as the act of last yearnamely, at so late a period of the session that they could not consider the subject with advantage? Last year it was the opinion of many of their lordships thatthe subject was so difficult and important as to deserve the consideration Of a select committee. Would his noble riend at the head of the Board of Trade agree to the appointment of a select cor,. mittee wilenlarliamentresumed afterEaster? Should the bills to which he alluded come before their lordships late in the year, let it not be said that any proposal for a select committee was rnade for the purpose of impedig their pro. gress, because «he now prayed tho Government thus early to allow such an inquiry to take place. (Rear, hear. It might be said that there 'ad been a commission on the subject, and that the propositions of the Government were based on the report of that commission; but he thought this Rouse, with the legal c,:nions at its command, was a fit and proper tribunal to consider what ought to be done upon a subject of suck importance in connexion with the commercial law of this country. As we were now in all probability approaching a timne of peace, the very difficult commerial contingencies consequent upon peace rendered cauation on the part of their lordhir,s -more mnportant than ever. That great and sagacious man, the Emperor of the French, had felt this, and had cautioned his people with zespect to the difficulties which, in the event of peace, might arise under the commandite anld partership Law of Fran It would perhaps be said that no evil consequences had arisen from thc bil of last session, but peace would give rise to comnmercial enterprise and introduce a state of things widely different from that which had existed since the passing of that act. If their lordships were to turn their attention to the new projects started, they would see what absurd and rash schemes some parties were willing and ready to embark in. )uring the year 1856 it was proposed to have a large joint-stock company, to be caUled the Universal Purveying Company, for the manufacture and sale of all descripons of food. Another comrany waas to be called a Laiuidry Company, and others had designations such as the Medicine Compoundg Company, the Telescopic Fire Escape Company, the National Newspaper League Company. Some of thema were of the most preposterous character. lhe Duke of AiGYtI--"tWho iS to judge of that?"J Why, he took it to be a matter of principle that limited liability ought not to be ran" for any commercil enterprise niless it could be sliovutobe a useful one, and also one which could not he carried out without that privlege. 'Upon this principle it was that the Board of Trade decided on charters to be given t companieS, andprivsleges alsowcreoccasionallygmnted by specialacts of Parlia nt upon the propriety of conferrng those privileges beinAgmademanjfesi Thepriciplewhiclathe noble duke seemed to advocate vr, that the privilege of limted liability should be granted to every set ofr mdividuals, who at their ownA wi awl. pleasure chlose to esa bDsh any commercial enterprise wh3tever, appeared to be one of a most dangerous charaeter, wholly unknown to the law of England, and. rejected, indeed, by his own Government when they framed their biUl last year. It was a principle which would exscite speculation and gambling, and all that the laws had hitherto done to xepress those practices would be undone, and more than undone, by the bill now before Parliament. The noble lord, after referring o certan opinions expressed during Last year against the prineiple of limited liability, concluded by moving ior returns of the number of joint-stock companies formed, or which have obtained certificates of complete registration under the Limited Liability Act, 1855, and of the number of applications not cormpleted under the act, &c. Lord STANLEY of ALDERIEY said, there could be no possible objection to themotion, With rpect to the questions put to him-of which questions he had received no previous notice-he must saythat it was highlyinconveriens that these sort of discussions should be raised in their lord, ships' house on nmeasures i2 pzgress through the House oc Commaons. The noble lord desired that their lordship; should not be urged togo into a discussion on the measre he had referred to at a late period of the session. All he (Lord. Stanley) could say was that he believed ther,l was everreason to sup;ose that the measaur would be brought up to their lordships in good time and if not it -would always be in their lordships power to deal Vftt it as they niight think fit Withregarl to the apointmaent-.f a select committee, he thought it VW the most inconvenient and the most extraordinary proceeding ever proposed, that one Rouse should appoint a comnwittee to iquire respecting a bill undertheconsideration of the other Rouse. Taut was evidently the intention of'tie noble lord, for he stated that it would be no answer to i.say that there had been already a commission of inquiry AoTthat conmission dealt witlh the principle of limit l4,hility and the law of partnership, whereas what was now ran6ted was an inquiry respe ting a measure entirelywne and uztprecedente& The noble lord observed that the Board of Tzaai now expressed an opinion on the propriety of granting Charters to companies; but that was a practice condIeWned by almost every on#, for the ophilo-n of one - President of the Board of Trade ih difftr frcnA $h;t of thQli t.t1 &U tog~ il be WIeOWUeq ly I. cottinnal fluctA4oi of decisions. ~Aa Ojl1a uc-o of ._t,h AXQjcisnt, tet, s n 'Ipere,' but he did not approve of the rggetl .C- a #ting the matter to a committee. I O-1 ZRSTO2; considered that the suggestion of ,ferrig the matter to a committee was far from being n reasonable, aid that it would be far less extraordinary tha1i the comw 'which the Government -had adopted- l retad to this subject. The Goveranment had Rome time sgo reiolved to issue a commision to inguire into the law of patnership, and then they brought forwad a measure1 directly in the teeth of the rport of the coruiLGSioners sad! of the evidence taken before them. Ifow was that measure introduced? .e Was informled that it was carried through their lordsbips! House during the last three days of the session without rany opportunity being afforded for its disoassion, and when thre were few peers in that house not directy connected with the G3vermnent. ("lHes, heir," and "'No, nto I) Well, be th as it may, he would ask their lordsliU to consider the protests which were laid on their lordshipse table, and to judge whether a measarw affecting such imnportant interests alihould have been pressed on snder such iLrcumstances. If the Government had allowed the bill to be withcdrawan they would have avoided what he must call the discredit of being obliged to announce on the very first day of the resent sesion, that they iUtended to repeal the bilL It had been his lot to live in the midst of that commercial world the interests of which were threatined by the bill, and, on behalf of the comamercial portion of the community, he potested against such asty legislation on subjeets of such importance. He said a subject of importance, and, in fact, ho believed that in magnitude no question of internal policy could be compared to it ; and if the Governutent determined to alter the ancient Principles of the law, upon which all commerciallhabits had hitherto been established, it was their duty seriotilyto consider the sutbject; and to bring before Parliament a measure by *wnch they were prepared to stand or 1ill. Re re- menberd te pnicof.1825, and he had no hesitation insaying tha=t i at Cthatitaie a bill like that which had been introdaced by the Government had -been. carried into law, a sate ot things would have beenprodricedin which evenbarter wouldhavebeen brought to stagnation. The country bad passed since then through various comwercial crises, and in each the mischief produced had decreased. There was oue thing which bad pained him exceedigly, ana that was the laughter and jeers with which the Governanent had recived the staternent of his o20ble riend As to wbat would be found to be the contents of one of the papers for the production of 'which he had aslred. Notwithtstading the severe drain upon the precious metals whdch hd taken place daring the lat r x months the commuercal operations of the country were in a sound and firm condition. Th'was esultof whichtheoyhadjustreason to be proud,-butthe p'henomenon was one which the Government ought careftlly to stutdy. Legilatioan pon this subject had hitherto beeu basedc ulpon theamlepnciples pouded by Hsr. Hulsson, who said truly, that there would bo great dangerto this oountry ingiving an undne expansion to credit and an undue stimulus to tZe spirit of speculation. The objection to this new legislation was, that it reversed 'theprinciples from which most valuAble results had been obtained. The inevitable tendency of this law of limritei liability was to extend and intensr the principle of credit, and to rouse up that dreadful demon-the spirit of speuation. Let the change of circumstances to which the noble Ior hbad eferre once arise, ande the giant woild soonL swell into hisnaual and formidable proportions. The principle upon -which they -were now legislat -xwas dangerous in the extreme. They allowed people tol orrow without being obliged to repay, to take another niaz's goods without beingobliged to replace them. (Hear, hear.) If they looked into ancient acts of Parliament, they would fihnd that in Saxon legislation the system of credit was distinctly called borrowing anot er roan's goods. Concerns such as those to which the noble lord had adverted could not be eatablished throughouxt the country without disturbing the vwhole course of commercial affkirs, and producing very aischievousconsequences upon rommercialmorality. Upon behalf of the commercial community he protested against these convicted felons being let loose among them. Their recent legidlation was false both in pritciple and in morality, and he thought a select committee ought to be appointed to inquire into the subject. He apologized for having addressed their lordships at greater length than he had interLded, butt he had done so for the sake of those commercial concerns which were desirous of conducting their transactions upon honest principles. (Hear, hear.) Earl GRANVJITh.-I am quite sure that it is unnecessary for my noble friend to rmke any apology for addressing your lordships on a subject of this sort. I only regret, as he wel lknows, that since he has been a member of the House he has not taken amore active share in our debates, and I am albost reconciled to the warm and alnost partissa feeling he has shown by his having addressed your lordships even upon a question with respect to which I have the misforture to differ from -him. I must decline togo now into the whole question of litmited liability. I shall refrain from remarling upon the instances my noble friend quoted to show the effects of limited liability, the crisis to vhich he referred having occurred in an exactly opposite state of the law. I shall not even ask him to explain how it can be conStry to Saxon morality t3 allow men to male what compacts they like between themselves, when they formerly possessed that power at common law, and it was taken from them by statutable enactments. It -would be inconven2ent to go into those questions in this thinly attended House, but there are one or two po=insto which t advert. The noblelord wasnot present at the end of last session, but he alluded to the circumstances attending the passing of the bil through this House. - nadit that it was intioduced at a very late period of the session, and that, as a gener2l rule, it is inconvenient that measures of importance should be discussed and carried within a few days of the prorogation; but I deny that there was no reason for taking that course I la year with. regard to this bil. ry noble friend, the - PresidenLt of - the . Board of Trade, following Mr. - Cardwell, . who had absolutely broLen *downv nder thre dificulties attending the grants of charters of limited liability, refudd to give any more of tlhose charters, Ibut compmies continued to be formed and to applg for them, and it was necesry for the relef of all parties that the bill should be passed. The noble lord gave a exaggerated account. of the state of th^e lHouse vw hen he said that no peers were present when the bill was agreed to except 2members of the Government and noble lords holding places coanected with the Government. - Lord OVERSTONE.-1 sai;d that the only peerswho supported the bill were those who were connected with the Government. -Barl GRA.NVILILEh.-When the House met-I amrm speaking of the occasion upon which the biU passed through committee-there were about 60 peers present. A long discussion took place-I spoke I do nut kiow how oftern-and the peers gradually left, as we went on repeating the same argutmients one after another until a very late hour. It is, therefore, quite true that veryfew peers were present at the end. of the debate, and I explained the state of the benches opposite by saying that it was not caused by the difficulty of obtanig the attendance of peers at that period oi the session, but by the unwillingness of a large portion of the Opposition to oppose a bn 'which, in their hearts, they thought a good one. The fact that every single peer belonging to trle opposite side has nLow left the house, not.withstanding the notice which the noble lord placed upon the paper, except one noble lord who has taken his seat smice last session (Viscount Dangannon) shows that my explanation was correct. My noble friend, with some warmth and injustice, attacked the Government for having thrown dic&ile up on a most important statement iaade by the noblelord whobroughtforwardthesubject. Wethrewno midicule whatever upon ib, but the noble lord threwriAicule upon certain companies which had established themselves for comercial purposes under the newlaw. When persons have -united themselves for certainL commercial purposes I do not think it is veryjustifmable for any peer to characterize as unfat the objects for which they have associated theuselves, and to create a prejudice against them- When the noble lord mentioned the objects of one or two comparies which -had been formed 'we merely remarked that there was nothing extraordinary ia them. He mentioned, among others, a newspaper company, and it certainly appeared to me to be most legitimate that people should avail themselves of that mode of enlightening the putblic. In nio single way are the Government obnoxious to the remarXk that they have treated this subject It a spirit of levity. The whole question is this-whether the Government ought to pledge tliemselves to ask for an immediate committee to inqugire into this suhbect, wad to give a pledge aIso as to the time when the bill now before the other House shall be brought before your lordships. I think the Government cannot be fairly charged with delay. The bih was brought ion the firt day of the session, it hasbeen read secon time, and no opportunity has been omitted of pressing it for'ward. Ibappen to know this for a fact, having gone to the right hon genltlemanv whohas charge of this bill to impreis umpon hiuthe necessity of lettingushavethebill inthis house asearlyaspossible, in orderthat we mayhaveanopportunity of discussing it. But, as to giving a pledge that the bil shall be i this house br a particular day, that would only be to of fer enconr3gemrent to those who niight be disnoseA to interpose delaY as a means of obstracting the progress of the bilL The Govermment, therefore, would not be justiEed in making such a pledge. Wilth regard to the select committee proposed, it woula h inconvenient for such a committee to go into the general question, and highly irregular if the bill were discussed before that committee 'while it is being considered in the other House, and before it reaches your lordasips. At adl events, I cannot give a precise answer to the question put to me by the noble lord without notice. I cant only say that mny noble friend is wrong if he -supposes the Government are treating this question with levity. He thincks it desirable that both HIouses of Parliament should fully consider the principles and details of a bill of a most in2porbaut character, and one that I must be allowed to say has been brought before Parliament at the pressing instanco of the commercial portion of the community. (RIcar, hear.) Earl GEREY.-Nothing can be more reasonable than that the Government should' not pledge themselves at this moment to grant a committee on this subject, and I hope and trust that the House will not pledge itself aginst the laeasure now before the other House. ButI must say thatI concur in every word of the maost able speech of the noble lord on the bench behinl me (Lord Over- stone), and having listened to that speech with great' attention, I aSgree with him in thinking that this lfouse wiil do wrong if it does not institute a deliberate inquiry. And I hope that, after the recess, if the Government do not themselves originate a motion for' a select committee on the sabject, some other noble lord will make a motion to that elrect. (Hear, hear.) We are told that it wiU be a very iMconvenent and unusal course for this House to institate an inquiry by a select comramittee into the provisios of abill before the other House of Parliament. V, lords, I never beard any one propose that a bill before the other House of Parliament should be referred to a committee of your lordahpe House, bu4t I amraore that, after a very, shBort gearch of your lordships! journals, there would b@ (grn4 jVass iu which gubjqt~o* V[ S t ina- pcxt&noe that appeared likely to reqr ue leglt.ioo ir ovmlmittee 1B Ahtilp.tiws of a-bill that Was Com&n VIfroMth*othree Hous Of Parliament.

Mfy noble friend ebhind ine quoted the aniu of 1825, aldthenmy nroble friend (Earl Granville) got up and reminded hiu that neither in 1825 nor in 1845 did the principle of limited liabilityexist, and, therefore, that any argunent arising out of those two A=ics 'was inapplicable to the present bilL Buit my- noble friend behind me did not say that the panic of 1825 bad been created by the existence of a law of limited liabIlity. What he said wa, that tlhe frightful panic of 1825, that caused ,o great an amoimut of misery, was mainly caused by the abuse of credit. (Hear, hear.) And he aid that the aimx and intention of this bill was to stimulate credit to the utmsno Lrl GRA.NVMM-J thi, just the contrary.] ty noblewi lbeina ne tinks, and I ae with him, thate intentontand object of this bill is to facilitate and stimulate redit The creation ofjoint-stockcompawies was a vnptom of 1825, for just before that period i'arliament )b, een funl of projects-of equitable loans, of pearl Sheries, and every Manner of project. At that time there were dozans of these joint-stock compa. nies, yet there ws some check then upon the formation of such companies; but now the object of this bill is to take off sach restraint, and to allow every man to create a jomtstock company, and, with a limited liability, to bring dupes to join bim in the most absurd projects. (Hear, hear.) The principl discussion upon the bilL of last session no doubt took plaee upon a second reading, and on that day there was a consider,able attendace, but it was impoBsible to stdythe bill dntiiug the limited time allowedS for the coninsxitee. For my owa part, I did not profess to be able to move al the amendmnets that ougt to be cared, but I thought it desirable to adopt those precau.tions w liha been ta3en in other countries in 'which the principle of the bill bad boon adopted. I, therefore, moved the adoption of some of tbe securties which the conmissioners in their report stated were taken in the State of clsc ett Somae of ui amendments were carried, and others were rejected. W-e were engaged for along timein debate, butI remembertlhe feelingof the House was so decided agaiWt the Governmeat that in one of the principal divisions not one single peer, except those in the Royal household, or holding places in the rovermnent, voted with the Jdinistezs and one peer who had been brought up from a great distance to vote with t,he Government, voted with the minority.

The Government of adras did sot adopt that recommendation, because they cousidered it to be unusual and improper; but recommnended to the BRoad o£ DirectoDs the extinction of the Raj and the grant off avension to the family of the late ],L-Dsarjah. In that recommendation they were supported by the Supreme Government of ndia. It was also true, because it followed ar a matter of course, that they had taken pos;ession of the territory and estates Of the Ilte Maharajaik, bi 1t was not. true that they had left his relatives and servants miprovided for. On the contrary, instructions had been given to the Resident at Tangore to provide for thiem during thet tme tat tshe questionoE succession was pending before the Court of Directors. instructions had not yet been sent out by the Court of Directors, because the letter from the Supreme Government was only received on the 8th ot Marc; but theywere in course of preparation.

It was impossible for sae the noble lord notice of the question I wished to put nthis subjett; nor inieed, in -m opinion, was all necessary. The ordinary rule which obtains i !house as to notifying to Ministers the p of questions that may be addressed to them by lhon. bers isnlot merely an affair of courtesy, but it arises the very nature of things.

STEEPLECHASING. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMS. Sir,-One day last spring I observed about 400 or 5D0 -people crowded together in the corner of a field near Warwick. The spot was otherwise a quiet one, and few people wereto be seen within half a mile. On inquiry this proved to be the "interesting" point in a steeplechase-that is to say, the miost trying and-dangerous leap for horse and man, where the risl; of injury or death is great enough to be quite exciting, and where some untoward event is looked for as a certainty. Comment upon such scenes is superfluous ; we all know howthey are conducted, and wherein consists the so-called -" sport;" but it is instructive to observe from your report of the Warwick Races how we progress in these matters. 'I extract an outline of the four-mile race yesterday "Forest Queen was soon put hors dc comnbat; she fell at the fence below the T.Y.C. post, got loose. and raced, riderless, alongside Potter, over the water-jump opposite the Stand to the fence leading on to the Lamnmas-land, where Potter refused, bolted to the right, and com- pletelydestroyedhischance; the mare was then caught. Vn charging the post and rails near the milepost, the second time round, Harry Lorrequer came dowvn, andTaffy alsofell. Nightingale, the rider of the latter, was much injured. At the fenceat thcommencement of the rails :tar of the West fell he was, however, quicldy remounted; but his' chance was out. Freedom repeatedly refused, and was pulled up in the Swan-meadow the second time round. The race in with the f,rst two was most interesting." I trust, Sir, you will use your influence to suppress these annual exhibitions of cruelty and folly. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, - EH. B. Begent's Park, MIarch 13.
ITO THE EDITOB. OF SEW TIMES. Sir,-May I occupy a corner of your paper with a word or t-vo on a pubic nuisance-namely, the total absence of -water-carts in this season of dust andl wind? I think we pay a sufficient water-rate to. entitle us to the benefit of tf3ese conveniences, wlich, I have observed, always make their appearance just too late to be useful, the timo when tboy are most needed being the present month. itdthat your valuable inflnence may have somo effect in theroper quarter, and obtain for the public an aleviation of this nuisance, which has beconme almost unbearable during the past week?.

ZiO.Y. SATURDAY, JIARCH 15, 1856. In the HIouse of Lords yesterday, Lord Dfu ,Aoro gave notice that he should, nfter Easter, move resolutions on the injurious ten-dencies and results of the ticket-of-leave system. The LoRD CnaxOmLroi laid on the table abill for .amending chnrch discipline in England and Ireland. 'The bill was read a first time. Lord BROUG A presented a petition complaining -of the present state of the laws of property as they affect married w6men. He strongly supported the prayer of the petitioners. He also presented a petition complaining of the amount of fees exacted in -County Courts. The Lonn CnA?Nc=oi said a bill on the subject had already been introduced. The Earl of SHAaTESBURy drew the attention of -the House to the 20th report of the Inspectors of Prisons. le read extracts from the report showing -that the state of the prisons in many of the counties of England was most unsatisfactory, and that -there were few prisoners committed to them who did not come out injured in health, and a great deal worse, morally, than when they entered. Hemoved for returns connected with the subject. Earl Gp%xvivE attributed many of the defects Alescrbed to the neglect of the visiting magistrate3 -and the local authorities; wrhere such neglect occurred the only remedy was giving it the publicity the Earl of Srm}rSnunY had donle. The Marquis of L?~sDowNE communicated to the House a letter from Lady TauRo, presenting to the 31ouse of Lords the valuable law library collected by the late Lord TRuRo, to be preserved in honour -of his memory. The Marquis of LA.NssDo-wN pronounced a high eulogy on the conduct of Lord RTauo as Lord Chancellor, especially of the care with which he bestoweed the patronage of his high office. Lord LrNDnRsRsT gavc a sketch of the whole pro-Eessional career of Lord T.uIRo, bearing testimony to his great learning and industry, and the disinterestedness he exhibited in frequently refusing briefs in fresh cases till he had thoroughly mastered the details of any diflicult or important cause in which he was retained. The LoruG CG;cEraoit attributed to Lord TRuRo -the merit of prepaiing the Chancery reforms carried - into effect under Lord ST. LEONARD'&. Earl Grms, as an additional proof of the disinterestedness with which Lord ¶LsuRo often acted, stated that al the labour of the committee of the House of Commons on the question of its privilege -of printing papers was undertaken by Lord TRIJO. That labour was, of course, wholly unremunerated, yet, while the inquiry lasted, he refused a large number of briefs that he might give his attention .exclusively to it. The Earl of DERRY thought the House should re-cord its acknowledgment of Lady TRURO'S gift. __ After a short discussion on the point of form, The Mfarquis of LiNisnowiNE suggested that the acknowledgment of the House might appear in the report of the Library Committee. The letter was then laid on the table, for reference to the committee, which will report in what way the donation may be best preserved, so as to carry lady TRuRo's object into effect. On the mnotion of-Lord MorxAoLE a return was -ordered of the number of joint-stock companies -formned or completely registered under the Limited Iiabilities Act. The House then adjourned till Tuesday, the 1st -of Anril. In the House of Commons, on the question that the House at its rising do adjourn until Monday, -the 31st of MUarch, MIr. DisLn±xr reminded the House that he had -put a question to the Fixs MnISTER of the Caowr -on the preceding evening, whether it was true that -an invitation had been made to Prussia to assist at -the Conferences at Paris; that the invitation had -been accepted; and that Baron MA1murm him-self and the Pruswian Minister at the Tuile-ries had been named as the Plenipotentiaries of Prussia; and that Lord PAiinMsroN had -declined to give any information upon the subJect. It might he highly expedient and politic, :Ir. .D.rsIuzL continued, that negotiations should be k-ept secret while in progress, but the very fact that the negotiations were secret was a reason why -the negotiators should -be known. Moreover, it -was impracticable to conceal them, and in the 3lo;teuJr of Thursday all these lacts were anmounced by the French Governnment; and he asked whether the Parliament of England was to be -the only place where no information utpon these matters was to be given. He was at a loss, Ire said, to account for Lord PALIxLRsToN's refusal -of information which it was his duty to impart, speeially since, if the fact were trLe, it was a subject of congratulation, as it was auspicious of peace, which would be more satisfactory if it were sane1tioned by all the great Powers of Europe than if ,one of them remained aloof and isolated. There -were peculiar reasons, in his opinion, why the sanction o' Prassia should be obtained. By her means z1one could the sentiments of Germany be ex-presecd; it could be almost said that Plrussia was Germany, and it was desirable for English interests that she should be present at the Conferences, for she might be considered as the natural ally of England. Lord PAsisnisToN repeated what he had said on the preceding evening, that when the Ginference met the - first resolution was that the prosseedingx should be i-ept secret, and the Plenipotentiaries entered into an engageement,forthemselves and their Governments, that secrecy sliould be kept-a resolution whiih he thought wise and prudent. Acting upon this engement, he had given the -answer referred to .by Jr. D1SR.sL Ittwastue, that Prussia had hitherto,been considered as one of the five great Powers of Europe, and if nothiiiglad been intended in assembling the Conference but to settle some general question Prusia would have beeninvited. But the-Conference was mssembled'to negotiate a treaty- of peace between Powers'ihich had been at war. Aushria; although not one of 'tle belligerents, had entered into' arrangee'nts with Turkey, and had acted the part of mediator, aud she could not be omitted from the Conferene.; but Prussia stood in no character which made her in any way aparty tothe negotiations. She had abatained fronm takng any pt whatever in the war, and had declined entering into any engagement with the allies, and therefore she had not been invited to' become a member of they Conference. Nevertheless, one of the objects which the Conference. had in view was a revisionof the treaties of 1840 anid 1841, regarding the staits of the Bosphorus, and therefore it became- expedient that Prussia should be invited, not to join in the negotiations, but to accede to the arrangements, and the nvitation had been accepted. In conclusion, he pointed out the inconveniences which would ensue if the Government were liable to be interrogated from day 'to day as to the progress of the negotiations. Mr. LAYDAi> put several questions to the PIrsrpmT of the IDIA BOAMD, the material portions of which were whether the Court of Directors or the 'Indian Government had been calledupon to prepare an expedition against Persia; whether Persia was preparing or contemplating an expedition against Herat or any part of Central Asia; and whether the expense of any operations against Persia would be borne by the revenues of the united kingdom or of India. - Mr. V. SMr repliid that two vessels had been sent by the -'Bombay Government into the Persian Gulf to protect the British residents at Bushire ;' that no positive information had 'been received of .any Persian epedition into Cdeiitrl Asia, and that -the allocation of the expenditure caused by a war with Pesia (which he hoped would'not happen)' :would depend upon the causes anid circumstances of' the war. Aftersomeobseervations bySirDR LAcyEvAs, Mx. GLADsTOixs said the impression upon his mind was that there was no material difference between the statement made by Mr. LA.YAP on a ,previous evening, respecting the cause of our dispute with Persia, and that of Lord PAL-&nasTox, and the discussion showed that there was a sentiment of uneasiness in the House, very natural, when expeditions were talked of, unless there was a presumption of an! adequate cause of quarrel; whereas, according to the reports in the newspapers,-the difference was of the' most insignificant and trumpery character.- The answer of Mr. Smr, that if war. should arise the matter of the expenditure would stand over for. after consideration, was, he thought, of much importance as regarded the privileges of that House. He dissented from the doctrine that they had nothing to do with the revenues of India; but, in point of fact, a war might be entered upon, a large expenditure incurred, and the charge ultimately fall upon the. taxation of the people of England. Before this country was entangled in an Eastern quarrel an appeal should be made to the House of Commons. Explanations upon this subject were given by Mr. V. Sun and Sir J. EoGG, and, after some conversation upon other topics, the motion for an adjournment was agreed to. A short discussion followed upon a motion by MIr. DuNiop that upon-the 17th of April, and all subsequent 'Thursdays during the session, orders -of the day have 'precedence of notices of motions, 'which was agreed to, except the date, which was altered to the 1st of May. On the order for going into a Committee of Supply, Sir J. HocG furnished certain explanations respecting the case of the late Mr. Dva' So3inn,' adverted to in an earlier part of the evemog by Mr. OTWAY. Mr. M. GrsSow inquired, as the proposals of Denmark for the abolition bf 'the Sound Dues were now under consideration, whether the Government had directed its attention to the expediency of comprising, in any arrangement. that may be made, the removal or reduction of the transit dues levied in Holstein and Lauenburg on goods passing by land from the North Sea to the Baltic.'- ' Lord PAia=sTON said that communications were going on between the Danish and other Governments upon the subject of a commutation of the Sound Dues; but he abstained from giving a more explicit reply to the question. A conversation, initiated by Mr. BATLLIE, took place upon the subject of the military finances; at its conclusion the House resolved itself into a Committee of Supply upon the remaining Army and Ordnance Estimates, when various votes were agreed to, after much discussion. A division took place upon the vote for rewards for distinguished services, w hich Mr. L&YvPxn proposed to reduce by 1001., the amount of the annual grant to Sir Rscn}uRr AnuRv; buf the proposition was negatived by 82 to 9. The resolutions were ordered to be reported. The other orders of the day were gone through. On the motion of Mr. LOWE, a select committee was appointed to inquire into local charges upon shipping,. after a discussion, in which Mr. VAsNC, Mr. W. Lm'nsSur, Mr. PawVICK, L2ord PAsEIESrOi, Mr. M. GIBSON~, Mr. WAIPOLE, MIr. L.^Bolucrmx; IMr. COBDENm, and other members participated, some of whom condemned ;what they conceived to be the precipitate withdraw al of their bill by the Government. Mr. BoulvanE Imoved for leave to bring in a bill for the improvement of the IJniversity and Colleges of Cambridge. * Mr. WIcinAsImade some observations upon the subject of the bill, and leave wras givren. The Solrorron-GEuRA moved for leave to bring in a bill to abolish the jluisdiction of the Ecclesiastical Courts in all matters relating to the probate of wills and grant of letters of administration, to establish a court of probate, and otherwise amend the law in relation to the administration of the. estates of deceased persons, giving a brief exposition of the nature of the measure. After some remarks by Sir J. PAXNGTON~ and Sir Fr. KELLY leave was granted.. Sir Fr. KxriY obtained leave to bring in a bill for the further amendment of the lawr of procedure and evidence. The remaining business having been disposed of, the House adjourned at a quarter past 1 o'clock until the 31st of March. RI
The correspondence on the alleged violation of American sovereignty by enlistment on the territory of the UInited States adds nothing of importance either-to the facts or the a:rgiunent of the question. It only. excludes some of the surmises -with which the controversy had been industriously aided, as fast as it was otherwise lapsing into the ranik of bygone affairs. It does not appear, nor is it even alleged, that Mr. Cxrumroni was ever kiiowingly violating the laws of the United States, or that he acted without :communication with the authorities of the States, or that he ever persisted in any proceeding whatever after it had been objected to by 'those authorities. NIr. MARCy does not maintain that MIr. COAs'roN broke the municipar law of 'the States, ancd on this point he appears to admit that Lord C nEIDONs answer last July was sufficient. If the correspondence stopped. here, or if it were confined to the question of intentions, no doubt in the case of most other States-in Europe, for example-we have the certain premises of a pacific and friendly conclusion. But here comes in the extraordinary feature of this correspondence, which we arebound to confess we regard with some alarm. That feature -is the assumption of a certain tone on the part of the American Government which savours not- only of -. a new soil, but of ;a new sphere. ' After reading -the letters, if docuinents of such pretension can be so modestly entitled, of' the American Government, one seems to understand rather better the preposterous claims put forth by some communities on the face of the earth;-how one empire boasts, celestial afflnities, and callsk the rest; of the 'world "c outer barbarians," how .another pays divine honours to its sovereigns, how others absolutely forbid the intrusion of a stranger, and how most of the Turks are under the belief that the SuTAir commanded ,the Westerx Powers to eome,t,o his aid. - The ground now taken by the American aover-menit is, -that though the British Clovernment'and its representative in the States had no; wish to break the municipa law of the Stex', anid possibly i did not break that law, and though, %o far, its eXplanations may' be satisfactory, yet it comitted the greater crime of not -respecting American E-overeignty. lor this it is alIed no sufficient satisfaction has-been offered, and -sucK is the loftiness aiid vagueness of the dignity said to be affronted 'that'one can scarcely venture to say what would be= sufficient-whether hecatombs would expiate -the crime. This sovereignty is treated as something wholly' distinct from law, and perfectly separable,, not only. in idea, but in fact. What if Mr. COarPt w observed the, law? what if Lord CLARENDON gave peremptory orders that it should' be observed? That is wholly beside the purpose, says the- American Government. They disregarded the sovereignty of the American people in their own territory. To Englishmen this style of argument is a process -in the clouds. In this- country -and in most other civilized'countries 'law"' 'is the expression, of sovereignty, and sovereignty is defined by law. We acknowledge no sovereignty in our Quum or our' Government, either towards ourselves;or towards foreigners, unless it be law. We acknowledge none the violation of v,which will not render --us liable to prosecution., trial, .nd punishmenf. We- presume it is a piece of -condescensilon to British ideas that when Lord CiA z?oN asks for.the proof that our representativez have violated Americaulsovereignty Mr.MAnc ,sendsthereport of some trials for simple offences against the United States' 'laW.- This wduld se6ii to admit, what Lord CrARiN-DoN very uaturally argues, that he is clear, if neither he nor his agents have broken the law, fok any one may do -in any tdrritory that which the laws -of that territory do. not forbid. But the PRESIENT of the United States and his SEcHxTARY for ForXmGo AFFAIRS do not see the necessity of this inference. They seem to hold that in the United States, at least, a man may observe the law to the letter, but yet be a grievous and unpardonable offender against something far higher than law-viz., . a mysterious sovereignty, the sovereignty of the people, and a far more jealous, irritable, and implacable so- vereignty than that of Emperors- and Kings. That. of the American Government is clearly something above law, and incapable of ordinary expression. In its presence-if we may venture to supPose onesself in the presence of- so, august and mysterious a personage-we feel as within the range of some terrible Genie, whose express behests we -might observe with the most servile exactness, but who could suddenly demand impossible satisfaction for some crime that no prndence, no loyalty, no prescience could have avoided. We have thrown the date-stone inside the waUl of the well, instead of outside, and a -iim potentate rises up from the abyss to avenge the innocent indignity. We are not aware of any offence that a foreign Minister could be guilty of in this country, except by an express violation of the law. He might, of course, make himself very disagreeable by arrogance or rudeness, or 'by lending himself to faction; but that would be a purely personal question, and in this case it is a public offenco which Mr. ORA oN is said to have committed, strangely without breaking any law. The American jourals seem generally to take neither the legal nor the transcendental view of the question. They go at once into material resources and political consequences. The United States they consider to be better prepared for war than any other people in the world, even though their small quantity of shipping and stores might put them a year or two in arrear. They have the men, the wealth, the spirit, the territory, and everything that gives sinews to war. On the other hand, a successful war-and, of course, it would be successful against this old aristocratical country-would wake the sleeping spirit of deniocracy, and drive .England to prefer the good will and example of America to her own ancient institutions. We are ready to concede that there is an amount of probability in these calculations. We believe the United States to be in most material conditions about the wealthiest people in the world. Nor do we think that England could suffer the frequent defeat of her expeditionsi the destruction and disgrace of her armies, the loss of her merchantmen, and the obstruction of hertrade,withoat great cost andlond complaints. But these are, to say the least, very dangerous speculations. They have often been indulged in with equal confidence, and constantly disappointed. War rarely does anybody any good, unless it be the few soldier adventurers whom it raises to the first ranks in society, and that other suttler race of men which grows rich on its extravagance. Such a war as the American papers seem to desire, and for which their statesmen are so anxious to find cause, would be quite as likely to affect the relations of American society as those of the English. It could hardly fail to hasten that inevitable day when the republic, like all other republics, particularly those of the New World, is to bloom into empire. BMoreover, the losses would not be trifling on either side. We are better prepared for war now than we were two years ago, and we should certainly take a great deal of beating before we gave in. We should fight and spend money with our usual courage and liberality, and, even if we were beaten altogether, it is still possible-we think probable-that the Americans would win victory too dearly to make it matter for self-congratulation.
Complaint has often been made, and with -considerable apparent justice, of the superior advantages enjoyed by those 3iflitary and naval officers who possess seats in either House of Parliament, and by the possession of those seats are enabled to - defend themselves against attacks which their less fortunate brethLen are compelled to leave unanswered. Whether Lords tUcAx and CAnDIG" have profited much by the power of pleading their own cause in the House of Lords we will not, in consideration of the pending inquiry, stop to discuss; but assuredly when fortune gave Sir CHuans NSAPIEi a seat in the House of Commons, and thus the power of bringing forward his own grievances, in his own way, the goodnatured deities were in one of those facile humours in which they overtur whole houses, as the Roman poet tells us, at the desire of their short-sighted possessors. Nothing that Sir CHAILEs NArERn himself could supply-nothing that his supporters or opponents could add-was wanted to the completeness of his discomfiture, the most complete, probably, that any hero, off the stage, has ever succeeded in drawing down upon himself. He entered the House with a reputation for skill and courage higher, indeed, among civilians than naval men, but still by no means inconsiderable, and with a vague idea that he had been il-treated, and that he had disclosures to make suclh as would cover his opponents with disgrace. He had obtained the voice of a large popular constituency in his favour, and by the. earnestness of his desire for inqiiry half persuaded people to believe that iniquiry would' absolve him from all blame. He left the house in a conditioix laeaiing about Ihe same relation-to the conditioit in wh h. he entered it au the fishing-boat of `Xmu)s did to his stupendous fleet, or the sledge pf,NAroiEox to the cannon and carriages gf the, Grand Army. N'ot only did Sir CHAkms ATAPIEx contrVo to fumnish his enemries with,every possible rnound of attack-he also did, his best to. 4epiiye himself of .every. povible ground of defencp, of every, ground of sympathy- and indulgence. :Ee cae before the,Rou,se to ask for justice, and he did aR in his power, by the outrageous accusations which he threw out, and the unscrupulous use of confideatial document to which he had recourse, to impress upon hia heaerm that if he sought for justice himself it was not with the wish or the intention. of doing justice. lst year we took volation to remak on tho gross impropriety, the violation of dut;y and of honour, implied in producing before the Eouso of ,Commons documents .of- a strictly confidential nature, which either respect for private comimunications or regard *for , the public, interest. required to be en.veloped in inviolable secrecy.. Such conduct is -a species of- criie,. and "ay be far more injurious to the . interests of the nation than nmany .of those which - our, 'Courts visit . with such exemplary severity. Nor was there any excuse for this. monstrous . betrayal . of ' public confidence--anyl necessity which might. palliate, if it coulcl not wlholly excuso, this departure fr:m~ rules -to -which'social as well as political cQnsidera q tionsh iave gryen the-forcm of bindingiand.undlter,| able law. Sir. CA&rLEs N'AIER was visited with no stigma, laboured under no public or official censure, had received no open mark of disapprobation, except hisremovalfro,iia'comnaiid'his retention.of which the public opinio'nof the country neverwould have tolerated. The private-censures he received 'he has made known -in 6rdeir that he might re'fute them, and thui dischar'ged the- double taslk of accusing as well ais defending himself. It is difficult to understand what is the precise charge that he brings against'Sir JA3ms GAnAm. Sir CHAitms accuses 'him of having written letters restraining his zeal during summer, the best time for action, and in autumii, when the time for action was past, seeking to goad him to dangerous and rash enterprises. But, granting this to bo so,-and it is' impossible not to admit that Sir JAs's conduct 'is susceptible of this construction,-the charge, even as Sir CHARLES NAnni puts it, seems to go no higher than an error in judgment, and to have no connexioA what- I ever with the violent and unreasonable abuse with which -it is preceded' and followed, and which eifectually deprived Sir CHAnLs NArmiEn of the syvmpatly of the House under the severe castigation which he received. The answer to the charge, such as it was, was easy and triumphant. Sir CHiTRLus NAPiE was treated differently at different times-reined in in the summer and spurred on in the autumnbecause experience had changed the estimate which the Admiralty had formed of his character. He started by informing them that he was ready for any service, however des-perate, and by the furious Eignal with which he announced the comimencement of hostilities -he , condinced the English Government as well as the Russian that he was bent upon the immediate performance of some hardy and terrible enterprise. Time wore on, and it was found that, though terrible in signals and letters, our Admiral had a great respect for batteries and 'fortifications, that ' everything formidable in itself - assumed in his eyes an aspect doubly formidable, and that things which British seamen in earlier days would have coiifronted without hesitation became in the eyes of this desperate commander absolute impossibilities. The 'storms, the currents, the fogs, and the fi-cs - terriiei -him beyond measure. Each fortress was pronounced impreg- I nable, each enterprise desperate aud hopeless. I In the beginning of June he approached within eight miles of Sweaborg, but for some reason hitherto wholly unexplained forbore to attack it, under the impression that it was unassailable, this impression being derived, not from personal observation,-for he made no reconnaissance,but from a belief that the channel, as laid down in the plans, was impracticable. An Admiral who reports on places when he has the opportunity of judging with his own eyes, and pronounces places unassailable which are afterwards attacked and taken, should not be too lavish in provoking unfriendly criticism. UInfortunately for Sir CHARnEs :rAPIEn, England and France were not content with a paper reconnaissance, and so they sent out two Engineer Generals, who, after an actual survey of the place, reported to their respective Governments that Sweaborg might be taken by means at the disposal of the Admirals. Of these reports Sir CH_utrims NAriER disposes very summarily, by saying that the one officer is mad, and the other has no confidence in his own opinion. LBut it is evident tlhese opinions, which were received in the early part of Septem-ber, produzed a change in the sentiments of the British Government. From that time the Admiralty dropped the rein and applied the spur vigorously and unsparingly to fthe sides of the reluctant Admniral. They forced him to make a personal reconnaissance, which he ought to have made months before, and urged him, but in vain, to do something beforethe season closed. It is of no use for Sir CHARLES NAP=s to say that this change was caused by the supposed fall of Sebastopol. The change was evidently caused by the reports of the two Engineer Generals and his own, all agreeing in pronouncing, upon personal observation, that the place might be destroyed, which Sir CHAIREs NAP'&Rx, within an hour's sail, had from plans pronounced to be impregnable. For this extraordinary remissness in the, execution of his duty Sir CHARLEs NAPIEn is fairly answerable to his superiors and to the country, and he ought to have been grateful that no public notice was taken of his misconduct, instead of ransacking confidential documents for proof of exaggerated and ridiculous charges, which, even if true, would have furnished no excuse for his own lamentable want of zeal and decision in the service of the public. It is melancholy to see a man who has done much and gallant service in his day thus overshadowingthe evening of his life, and calling into prominent notice faults in his own conduct, weaknesses, and infirmities which, but for other faults of character and discretion, mighthave passed unnoticed and unregarded. But Sir CHARiS NArim would have it so, and we are bound to say that he has made out a case against himself which no amount of assertion or abuse, no past exploits or present popularity, are able to alter or to extenuate. - -
Au event has just taken place at Berlin which blings home to us the difference between our own institutions and those of nations which claim . to equal or surpass us in civilization. The President of Police, aerr Vox HTh'XELDEY, has been shot in a duel by Herr Vow Rocuow, a y-oung nobleman, - an officer of the Landwehl, and a.member of the Prussian Upper House. If merely a private matter had led to a quarrel, a duel, and the death of one of the combatants, the occurrence would still have been surprising enough, since for a President of, Police, the natural guardian of order, to violate the law is strange enough anywhere, and especially sa.in a bureaucratic country, where official rank has the highest privileges anda duties. But what makes the case most -importaut is that political feeling weems to have beea the cause of this wi- Jappy, and indecorous oU .AS0i , -iAd. tlkt4 Jf the general opinion of Berlin igs to be tristed, HErrYVox Hr1LN,XIMY is the victim of a set of cruel and relentless conspirators. It is well known thLat Phussia, like the rest of Germany; has an order of -nobles distinguished by an inordinate pride in their only attribute of superiority-their -ancient lineSp. -With little ancestrl wealth, with no political. taleits, with no claim-to lead or to be respected by the people, some two -or three thousand families ,,etend to cazr back their pedigrees to a period: .b&re modernhistory began-and o ulook pon no n1afl alwnbLe if . nobility can7 be proved to -hare been confered on hi family at any. defiiite date.

The great statesmen who rose up in Prssia at the hour of hei deepest calamity organized the system of administration which 3o3w exists. Centalized, bureaucratic, rigid, pedantic, it iaay be, but, conipaxed with what preceded it, and what -Herr-Vo- Rocuow, lhis party, and their organ,. the KEeuz Z&it11g,, wish to restore, it is worthy of all respect; for it is, at any rate, founded on principles of natural justice, of equal rights and equal burdens for alL The Minister of Police was a bold -upholder of the sovereign power, which is in Prussia really the power of the people. He would carry out the law agaDst all classes, and make no exception in favour of any .order which might fancy itself privileged. The nobles and the military were not to be -excluded from the operation of his municipal authority. He appears to have been an able admiuistrator; he paved and lighted Berlin, introduced lodging-houses for the poor, a fire brigade, the electric telegraph, waterworks, baths and washhouses, and a new system of employing criminals profitably. In fact, he was what we should call in England an able public man. But these merits were hidden from the eyes of the rlteuz Zeitung party, who were always talking of the days of FRiTz, when a good Prussian hated a Frenchman, and a nobleman was properly respected. The Minister of Police was too reforming for the party which has through the whole of this war leant to Russia, and has, by enlisting every prejudice against the Western nations, obtained in the Chambers and in society a power probably disproportionate to its real strength. At last the dislike came to a deadly feud. A party of noble officers were gambling in Berlin, RoC3Iow among them. The President of Police, acting by Royal instructions, sent to arrest one of the number and to disperse the others. It seems that the man chiefly sought, and said to be a notorious blackleg, was not present on that evening, and that the police behaved with a lack of courtesy. However, from that time HirxKzDEy was a marked man. With a cowardly spite which we can hardly understand in this country, his wife and daughter3 were insulted in Berlin society. RoC3Iow denounced him to the IxoG as " a liar." It seems that the clique maarked, him out for destruction. He was to be insulted on every occasion, and forced to challenge one opponent afteranother until he fell. At last he appeared at a carrousel given by some of the Pinces and the nobility. Here ROCHOW stepped up to him and told him that the presence of a police agent was not required. What need is there of further detail ? Hina=DEY wvas obliged to challenge his persevering defamer. He went home, sent in his resignation, made his will, arranged his papers, wrote his last letters, and then repaired to the field. It is said he did not know- how to fire a pistol. His antagonist was skilful enough, and had chosen the pistol as his weapon. RocHow walked up to the "barrimre" and shot the Mfinister dead. The party to which the survivor belongs makes no secret of its exultation. RoCrow, arrested for a few hours, is now at large on parole. It seems likely that he will escape the consequences of his crime, for when a man is singled out for destruction by a siecession of antagonists even the code of honour must pronounce it a crime. "( The lower classes," says our correspondent, "recognized in HrxDsY, with instinctive tact, "their own protector and benefactor ; it is pre- -enainently said of `hm that he was just-tllat. is "to say, that he exercised his power with equal "hand towards high and low. This was true of "his life, and has been the cause of his death." It now remains to be seen -what course the KING' will take. He is said to have inown of the duel long before it took place, and yet, when he learnt that his faithful servant was dead, to have broken forth into ex2clamations of grief and anger. Some may thinlk that such an incident is claracteristic of the Monarch, and gives little reason to hope forfirmness in the punishment of the offender, or in resistance to the mischievous and insolent demands of his palty. FREDERICx WILLrAa seems, indeed, the most unfortunate of Kings. With far more talents than are allotted to the generality of men,-with high moral principles and a niind improved by long cultivation,-he can reason or criticize on most subjects better than those he talkls with. But esthetic education and pietistic morality are equally unable to point out to him the right path in any difficulty. He is always full of some visionaryscheme; at onetime it is tobe anabsolute, but paternal and pious King; at another, it isto be a democratic Enperor. A few years since his patriotism led him to make an assault on a small and unoffending State, and lately he has subjected the chief interests of his country to the dictation of an aggressive barbarism. It is. in this last phase that the death of HmrzimEY finds him, and who shall say what hope of impunity may not have been cherished by Rocuow and his friends from the seeming willingness - of the Kaiw to yield all to the audacity and perseverance of their party? It is to be hoped that the late event will rouse -F!BDERicx WuIIAm fr0om the apathy of the last two years. Prussia has accepted the invitation to send an Envoy to the Conferences, and it is in her power to reassmne in some degree the high place in Europe which is her due. If the KnIm has energy enough to oppose the -band who wish to alienate Prussia from Western Europe, to restore all the iniquities of the old system, and to maLe their country merely an advanced work in a Russian plan of aggression, he. has now an opportunity, and may nobly redeem the past. He may well .doubt the moral elevation of a party wvhich could plan such a deed as has just -been perpetrated. Nothing of the kind has taken place in these islands since the days of the lrish Parliament, and even then there was hardly an example of any such settled plan- of vengeance. In the -heat of debate one orator might say of another,- "I will "not call him a liar,. because it. is unparlia- 3 'entary," or, alluding to his attainixent of office, declare that, " like the corpse of a drowsned "man, he rose as he rotted ;" the consequence was, of course, an exchange of shots next moriin5,.

ATJSTRITA. (FROM OUR OWN COREESMWDZ T.N VIENNA, MAnCE 10. In my letter of the 3d I alluded to the Duke of Galliera in the matter of the Italian railroads, and it is now generally known that he has coalesced with Baron Rothschild and his party against the French Cr6dit Mobilier, which he came here to represent. Al. Charles d'Andrd, who arrived here too late to prevent the Duke's desertion to the enemy, returned in hig,h dudgeon to Paris some four days ago, so that you may oxpect to find a full, trae, and particular account of M. de Galliera's proceedings in the French papers. The Duke's excuse is, that if he hAd not taken the 20,000,000 of lire, the French Cr6dit Mobilier would not have got it. The fact is that the Ministry of Finance - cannot forget that The French Company hadc by far the best of the bargain when it acquired possession of some of the State railroads about 15 months ago, and the Supreme MIilitary Cnmmando is annoyed by the thought that it cannot move a company of soldiers or a battery from Austria to Hungary without the circumstance being known to the French. It was long ago settled that the Italian railroads should not be ceded to the Credit Mlobilier, and M. de Galliera learned that such was the case very soon after his arrival here. Full a fortnight since you were told that wild speculation was going on here, and the Ost-Deusiche Post thus confims my statement:- "1 The desire to engage in speculation on 'Change has during the last few weeks become a kind of mania. Stockjobbing is going on in all places and at all hours of the day and night. In the legion of speculators every age, business, and class is represented. It is highly interesting to stroll through the "Herren-gasse" (the street in which the room known as the Exchange is situate) at 'Change time. The persons who cannot obtain admission make their bargains in the neighbouring streets or under the entrances to the houses. Old women, young girls, small traders, shopmen, workmen, and servants are all clients of the jobbers." Large sulms must be won by the professionals and lost by the uninitiated, for the Credit Bank; shares, which on Saturday were at 349, were offered this morning, before 'Change, at 309. On 'Change they rose to 323. It is averred in somne of the foreign papers that the Austrians have induced some of the men of the Anglo-Italian Legion to desert to them, but the assertion is too ridiculous to obtain credit. Marshal Radetzky is, on the whole, a goodnatured andchumane man, but if anydeserterfromthe Anglo-Italian Legion attemptedto crossthe Austrian .frontier he would stand a very fair chance of getting -an ounce of lead inhis brain. The Austrian Generals are much afraid of their soldiers being tampered with,and the strictest orders are given to the mento hold no communication with the people on the other side of the frontier. It is said Austrian bank-notes are now taken on the Saxon frontier at par. The rate of exchange 'on London was J per cent. higher to-day, and the premium on gold and silver rose in the same proportion. It has recently been remarked that reports calculated to produce a panic are invariably spread on Sunday, on which day there are no evening papers. PRUSSIA. (ztom ouu owN conBsroPwDENr.) BERLIN, MARCu 12. It is so seldom now that Berlin has an event of its own for me to record, and the, death of Herr von :inkeldey-is one of sach universal interest for all resident here, foreigners as-wel3 as natives, that you must.allowme to continue the subject to-day, and supply a variety of incidents which I was prevented yesterday from mentioning. The duel took place on Monday forenoon, as already mentioned, at an open spot just beyond the .grounds of the Royal Palace at Charlottenburg. The corpse of the late President of Police was brought to Charlottenburg and kept there during the afternoon; it was, however, conveyed into town during the night, anld, in a certain sense, laid out in state at his official residence. The groups of agitated and excited talkers of the evening before, which encumberedthe open ground in front of the Polizei-presidium, were yesterday converted into a dense mass, streaming continuously into the house to view with feelings of attachment and regret the remains of the man whose title awakens in nglish minds only thle *idea of vexatious tyranny. The lower orders here recognized in him with instinctive tact their own protector and benefactor; it is pre-eminently said of him by the lower classes that "he was just ;" that is to say, he exercised his power with equal hand tow-ards hligh and low. This was trae of his life and has been the cause of his death. I know of no event, short of the murder of the King, that could have produced such a sensation in the lower classes of society as this duel and.its result have. in *themiddleclassesthe excitementis the same in degree but different in its nature; not so much regret for the Police President as firm hatred against the exclusive and overbearing oligarchy that is now grasping all power in Prassia. These middle classes, which contribute tho most to the taxes, though with less disposable means than the nobility have, can hardly forgive Hinkeldey for having introduced vast improvements into the machinery of life in this capital, seeing that these improvements require to be paid for in local ta:xs ; the Berliners wiU freely squander thalers for any amusement, even so poor as coffee, cigars, and fiddling, but they begrudge. groschens for works of public utility and the common -we.L Among the upper clames there are, of course, many men of 6ilightened and liberal minds, who can appreciate the man the country has lost, and be. wailmost of all the manner in-which heha6been snatohed from his sphere of usefulnezs; but in those circles which offer the distinctive features of the nobility, army, and landowners, the Kreuz Zcitung party, the Treubund, the iTuers (those Pharisees of religion and loyalty), there reigns a warm feeling of satisfaction that the " fellow" has been got rid of so cheap. Had he escaped unscathed from the first duel another awaited lhm the following day, and was already anged with Herr von I Prittwitz, a Lieutenant in the Guards; and, if he had escaped from that, there were plenty of other noble bullies, skrilled in pistolling, readyr to driivehim to further dulels Ridiculous as it; may appear, this awful President of Police, who had never served in the army (he was not a Prussian by birth), was so totally ignorant of the use of firearms, that he was compelled on the ground to ask his cond for instruction how to fire his weapon, and his first attempt failed entirely from his awkwardness in fumbling, for the trigger. His antagonist, as the challenged party, had the choice of weapons, and, of coue, chose those in which he was skilled; and a more striking proof of his skill could hardly havbbeen given: the distance, 15 paces (about 35 feet English), is said to be too great for a wound tohave been probable, and yet he hit his man in the most mortl and best selected part possible; and the rejoicing chorus of deFhYted "Guardsmen"' have pronounced the shot a Meisterschus! In confirmation and elucidation of what I wrote to you yesterday I have since learned that the original cause of the duel was the report presented to the King by the President of Police on the subject of the party of the Jockey Club, whom he had caused to be surprised in one of their nightly meetings at an hotel: he had in that report affirmed that there were "gamblers" present. Herr von Rochow, who was one of the party, and who had on a former occasion, in company of the Duke of Ratibor, evinced a certain solidaritg with theparticuLar blacldeg of whom the police were in search, presented a remonstrance to the King, denying the fact of gamblers having been present, and sigmatizing Hinkeldey as "a liar" (sic). The latterlearned this sooner or later, but had not thought it necessary for him to take notice of it, it not coming officially or personally before him; his own participation in the affair had beenofficial, andat the King's command; the report had beenfurnished to the King, and, if he showed no diminution of confidence in him, it was not incumbent on him to pick a quarrel on That account. The Junker party, however, to which the individuals offended belong, and which had hitherto always spoken of Hinkeldey as one of the firmest supporters of the throne, coulnot pardon his acting against themselves as though they were common people, and denounced and treated himeverywhere as a man who had ereeived the lie and had not the honourable feeling and the courage to demand satisfaction. As, however, the King would notlet Herr Hinkeldey leave the service, in spite of his frequent resignations, the party determined, by putting on him and his family and the institution of which he was the head every possible indignity, to compel him to duels with A, B, and C, all through the alphabet, un'til he fell, or was dismissed the service. The incidents at the late carrotuse completed Hinkeldey's conviction that repeated challenges to the whole lot was the only way of reinstating himself; and, having formed his resolution, he sent in his formal and final resignation to the King, together with a statement of his mnotive: he resigned, because it was not fitting for a President of Police to fight duels, &c. It throws a fearfully bright light on the power of this clique, and a deep shade on the weakness of the King, that although he knew of the approaching duel four days beforehand he took no steps to coerce the man into an apology who had insulted his own faithful servant, engaged in the execution of his own immediate orders i Einkeldey's second, himself a member of the Herrenhaus, took every step, during a week, to dissuade his; " noble" compeers (Rlachow is also member of that house) from their plans, but in vain; the Minister of theInterior, the personal antagonist of Hinkeldey in matters of administration, did everything in his power to appease the latter and divert him from his purpose; on the eve of the duel he even sent him officially and formally the King's most positive commands to retain his office and abstain from any further steps. But nothing, was done to compel the offending individual to an apology ! How conscious of the power of his party is the skilful shot and successful duellist, member of the Herrenhaus, and scion of a house which boasts of being older in Prussia than the Hohenzo1ern themselves! He gives himself in charge at the Commandant's in Berlin for having shot Herr von Hinkeldey in a duel; he is allowed to go at large on his parole; "it was only a duel;" he presents himself at the Ministry of the Interior with the same result; heis arrested in the evening by the criminal police, but reclaimed from them by the military authorities the next morning, and set at liberty again on his parole. And how well he has; been borne out by his order!u The President of the Herrenhaus, in opening the sitting yesterday, made a speech to the house full of regret that one of their members sould have met with the unpleasa;ntness of having to fight a duel, and of being imprisoned 12 hours, but he had not one syllable of reg,retforthevaluablelife that that member had destroyed: "Gentlemen,-I have to inform you of a melancholy event. One of the noblest members of this House has been involved in the painful position of havingto choose between the dictates of his honour and an action contrary to the laws of the country. For the purpose of preserving to himself the consciousness of his honour he has violated those laws. He has informed against himself and delivered himself up to the authorities. Paragraph 84 of the Charter permits them to imprison him. The examination is going on. w'e can only -egret no longer to see among us the noble lerr von Rochow, who has thus been compelled by circumstances to take this course P On the eve of the duel the deceased made his will, wrote to each member of his family, his farewell to the King, and to various enry7oys who enjoyed his particular confidence. According to his express desire, expressed in-anticipation of the event, the funeral is to take place to-morrow, in all simplicity and absence of parade; but nevertheless very lively anxiety is felt, lest the almost inevitable demonstration of the people should lead to any breach of the peace. Last week there was already a riot at a public ball between officers and civilians, and every time officers frequent a public place of resort there arises a danger, owing to their irritation against the police and all who are likely to side with the latter. Strange to say, particularly as coming from mne, who have so often pointed out the vexations of police rule, our sympathies as freemen must be on the side of the deceased TPresident of Police and of the instita-: tion of which he 'was the head. It -S the only pcower here that can in any way intervene between the people and the arrogant encroachments of the noble military, that set themselves above the ordinary control of the laws. The late melancholy duel was only an overt practical evidence of the same feeling that lately induced Wagner, the quondam editor of the Kreuz ZeiUng, to move in the House of Deputies3for the repeal of thatarticle of the Charter which guarantees that " all Prussian are equal in the eye of the law; privileges of rank no longer exist." It is the determination of the party to get themselves exempted from taxation, from military service, from amenability to the ordinary tribunals of justice, &c., and, above all, to be relieved from all interference on the part of the police with their pleasures or their vices. This is the party which, at the commencement of 1854, did all they could to induce the King ancd his Ministes to mobilize the army, as a demonstration in favour of Russia against theW esternPowers. When that failed they strove to get the King to imitate the example of Austria, viZ., to disband troops and diminish the military force for the purpose of at least convincing Russia of Prassia's pacific intentions, and ler disapproval of the course taken by the Western Powers. This is the party which has rejoiced in Prussia's exclusion from the community of the liberal nations of Europe- which has greedily reprinted every article in the western press that heaped abuse upon Prussia for her neutrality-which has fanned all the coals of dissension between her and Europe, in the hope that her isolation would compel her to throw .herself into the arms -of Russia. For this partv there can hardly be any more unwelcome and bitter pll than the newfs I am about to forward you by telegraph this evening, viz., that Prussia has been invited, "in the name of the Congress," to depute Plenpotntiaiesto te cnfernce atParis, andl

Rutter, county coroner of cashire, on the body of lMr. John Hobler, aged 21, a young gentleman of highly respectable connexaons in London, who had been studying the profession of a machinist and toolmaker at the works of Messrs. Whitworth and Co., of Mhnchester. The deceasqed resided with Dr. Clay, of Manchester, a relative, and absented himself in the month of January, leaving letters behind him stating his intention to destroy himieL Of course his absence created much alarm and uneasiness, and his friends advertised him, and took measures, through the police, with a view to diucover his retreat, but in this were unfortunately not succesful On Wednesday his dead body was discovered in a copse or plantation called Cheetham!s-clo3e, in Turton, near B#lton, near a road but little frequented ; and, from the state of decomposition it was in, the body hadiprobably been there for some weeks. An empty phial and wine glass were found near the body, leading to the supposition that the unhappy gentleman had poisoned himlself. The body was discovered by a boy in company with Mr. Kay, of Turton Towver, tha owvner of the property, while in search of game. In one of deceased's pockets was found a letter 'with this ad. dress outside:-" The finder of this body, particularly addressed to the police, inquisitiveness beinz their misfortune." The leter was as follows:-" ff they make it a case of tempOrary insanity it will be soon the part of the JUr. early beloved cove or coves,now that you have found this body do notbe an idiot or idiots, and get uip an inquest to talk about what they knowr nothing about; but somewhere in my pockets you will find 6 dL, with which get a gill.

You need not read over it any service, as I read it myself before starting; and by selling my clothes you will be able to pay yourself for your trouble After which, go away; and above all things do not try to find out who I am, &c., as you willnot be able, but do as I say and the Lord reward you accordingly. Yours truly. The verdict must be that, in great consideration for some person or persons, hc destroyed himself to save them the trouble." At thae time the inquest was commenced the name of the deceased had not been ascertained, but Dr. Clay, of Manchester, afterwards identified the body, and the jury agreed to a verdict to the effect that the deceased had destroyed himself whilelabouring under ten.porary insnty. Dr.CSay statteiX that, before leavinlg Manchester, Mr. Hobler was in alow and desponding state of mind, brought on by over-stuldy. SuicrD Ar ST. PFA's.-Yesterday a person named Alexander Smart committed suicide by precipitating himself from the whispering gallery of St. Paurs Cathedril into the nave, a distance of nearly 150 feet. The deesmed had been a dock and watch maker, but had retired from business a considerable time, and had been residing with his wife at 4, South-street, Berkeley-square. After he had waited in the gallery until the clock struck 12, he mounted the handrail of the gallery, gave three hysterical laughs, and cried out each time, "Ah, ah, ah!" Two vergers named Thompson and Hutchins, who were both in te ga'lery, anticipating what he intended, rushed forward, but before they could get to the spothe had succeededin jumping from the handrail and fell upon the stone flags which pave the nave. The warder ran to the spot, when theyfound deceased lying on the pavement of the church quite insensible. Mr. Keating aud another gentleman were sent for and promptly attended, but upon examining the body, they pronounced life to be extinct. The deceased had received compound fractures of the left shoulder, the legs and one arm were broken, the spinal cord was didsocated, and besides other injuries the head was beaten in by the falL. Upon the body of the deceased were found several pieces of paper bearing hLs own address, a sovereign, a S.-piece, t s. 6d. and a letter addressed to a well-known noblemrs a It appears that on a former occ asion the deceased shot himself at the side of his head, but did not receive any mortal injury. A Se o a?NGE DEravsrge.-On Thumrsay afternoon Mr. Jardine, SolEcitor to the Treasury, accompanied by Sergeant Lockyer, of the detective police, lert town for St Alban's for the purpose of inquiring into the conduct of a Mr. C. Parker, who has for the past two years resided in that neighbourhood, and who has lately attracted attAetion inconsequence of his strange assertions respecting himself. The object of the above gentlman's visiting St. tebanc and the factaof the case. are briefly these. Recentlyi sad so late as the4th of March, two letters, purportingzto come from MAr. C. Earker, as above, were receiveuL at3 the Palace, addressed to Hier Majesty, in the first oE 'which the writer, after describing himuself as the Prophet Elijah, proceeds to assert his riglht to the crown, and requires of Her 3Mjesty to surrender her rights and dignities to him, as the lProphet chosen of God, If Her MiLajestyr refused, then he would command it by main force at the point of the bayonet, and HIer MSajesty 'was to abide the consequence when ho ascended the throne. The second letter held out no personal threat. The nnfortunate man was conveyed to the station, whera evidence was taken as to his state of mnind and his strange conduct for the last 12 months. Dr. J. P. Nicholson gave it as his opinion that Mr. Parker was of unsound mind, and that it was necessary to place him under restraint. The accused reiterated to the Benchhisconviction that he hadbeen actualy commis. sioned of God; that he was mentioned in; the second and last verses of the Old Teostaent, and again in Revelations ; and that Godintended to confer upon him uanlimited power and wealth in this country. Au order havirg been mnade for his removal to Bethlehem Lunatic Asylum he was taken from the town the esame evening for London. He is very respectably connected, and has a brother a barrister in the TemDple.

In the corn-market this morning there was extraordiuy firmness, and an advance of 4s.was realized, in addition to the previous recovery this week of 2s. The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the week shows a limited business, with a tendency to lower yces The final quotations of the French Three per Cents, on the Paris Bourse this evening were 72f. ','5c. for money and 73f. 35c.. for the end of the month, showing an improvement of about an eight.h. At Amsterdam the market remains without lteration, except iu Spanish and Portuguese, which contmine steadily to advance. Tho returns of the Bank of France for the past mont:i present few changes of importance. The purchases o Liullion made in this country, at a loss, as it appeas, of 5Z,ooWt. during the month, have resulted merely in preve-king a falling off, the amnount in hand being almost pre2e-y the same as at the last statement. The note circuib&-n has decreased 345,000Z., and the discounts 306,00X;., ,but augmented assistance.has been granted to theBourse, an increase being exhibited of 760,0001. in tne advances on Govermment stocks, and of 72,000Z. on railway securities. The deposits of the public show a decrease of 294,0001., while in the amount to the credit of the Treasury there has been an improvement of 1,072,0001. The further commercial advices from N'ew York to-day by the Atlantic describe no alteration in the stock-market, except that the tendency was rather towards increased firmness. It was expected that this steamer would have brought about 100,0001. in specie; but it appears that most of the gold which had just arrived from California consisted of coin, and that there was no bar gold in the market. At the etisting rate of exchange it was the latter only that could have been remitted with profit. In the colonial markets during the week the transactionshave been moderate. A fair amount of prodluce has been offered, and, with few exceptions, rates are unaltered. Considerable quantities of sugar were brought forward-in the early part of the week, and the market opened with flatness. There was a general disirclination to purchase, and prices declined 6d. per cwt. Gradually a re-action took place, and to-day the sales went off with animation, the fall being fully recovered. A cargo of Porto Rico, first of the new crop, was taken, after much compatition, at very extreme quotations. -Privately a cargo of Manilla has changed hands, as well as several parcels on the spot. The Dutchl Trading Company's spring sale went off with very -little activity and at a fall of 1 guilder on the valuations, which showed a decline of 8 to 9 guild&rs on the November prices. An improved inquiry arose for rice in the early part of the week, but it -was not maintained, the market closing heavily. The demand for tea is still very dull, and there is no improvement in Drices. Coffee also re3nainsiwithout change. Little has been done, and thi' quietness will doubtless continue until the-arrival of the new crop, some of which is now offthe coast. A good inquiry still exists for saltpetre, and an advance of Is. 6d. per cwt. has been paid. At an extraordinary general meeting, of the Australian Direct (vid Panama) Steam Company, held to-day, it was resolved that a dissolution should forthwith take place, and that the remaining assets should berateably divided. A negotiation has been pending for the last three months with influential parties supposed to be desirous of purchasing the charter; but, a misunderstanding having arisen with regar to the precise terms, they have now declined to carry out the transaction. Had the arrang,ement -been completed, the shareholders would, it is stated, have been enabled to retire withlout loss, while under a winding up they will have to sacrifice rather more thanhalf of the original deposit of 21. per share. The existing balance isr6,80U., and it is proposed to make a return of 18s. per share with all possible despatch, leaving a small surplus to meet contingencies or for a final distribution. Although the vitality of the company has been temporarily prolonged without any beneficial result, the proprieWrs entirely exonerated the directorsfrom blame, the negotiations for a transfer of the charter having promnised, when they were opened, to lead to an advantageous arrangement. The report of the Canada Company has been issued, preparatory to their meeting on the 20th inst. It is. made up to the 31st of D)ecember, and shows that, taking into account the-land still undis posedl of (612,643 acres3 at its e.stimated -average - value in 1854 of 22s. 9d. currency per acre (the result of a re-survey made in that year), the balance in favour of the proprietors, after providing for the repayment of their capital, is 8S1,S531. It also shows that the average price realized for the lands sold o rleased in 1855 was equal to the rate of 43s. 9d. curreracy, or 39s. 4d. sterling, per acre, being an advance of I0s. 4d. per acre upon the average price realizmd in 1854 With reference to this last fact a correspondent pwints oat that the real position of the company's affairs, therefore, on the 31st of December last may be regarded as follows:- Baianc nfavour of te iropretors. afer prosiding forreprsymentofcapital.. -.... .. .. £881Si,3 0 0 Add cah,itnl. £32 d oi per9 share. 5equa9l5 rbarff . . 2S9 Per 40re ddeajeecobletwreen 2i d currency per acre (at pored o: ha been etioMated incthe comgtnysl state- acta4yealizedforthe lnsodsdpoed fin i555. sT7,671 o 0 Totai surxlw.I.. . .. £1,749,261 0 0 Wbich. ditided by 8,915 shares.

J;ames Mill, aged 23, was indicted for the wilful nurder of 'Wifred Deacin, at Sheffield, on the 29th of January last.nth 9hoJaiy - Mr. Hdy and Xir. Joh.stone prosecuted, and Mr. BlanEWhard deiencei &. ;±rliner. -J It apad from the 'openn- P i ot the learn" or ho-prosecution, and from the evdence of the various witnesses called by him, that the child with Whose murder the prisoner was charged was the son of Walter Dealdn, a tableknife hafter, at Sheffield, and was the youngest of three cildren, two of whom were girls, aged respectively nine years and five years, and the decesmed child wa three yess old. The prisoner -was the brother of Walter Deakin's wife, and was therefore the uncle of this child, of whom he seemed fond, and used to take it out walinDg, and sneak of it as " our gaffer." The prisoner is a penblade-maker, at Sheffield, and lived at home with his father and mother, both of whom are old and depending on him for support, his father being 75 years of age. Walter Dealan, the father of the child, w-as in the habit of keeping his razor on a shelf over the sink in the kitchen of his house; and on Thursday night, the 24th of January, the prisoner called at Dekidn's house, when the children were all within, and a girl named Axrnold. Hre asked Arnold to put the shutters to, and while she was doing this he went to the shelf where the razor was keapt, and, in reply to Ellen Deakin, the eldest child, who asked him what he wanted, said he ws getting a pipe. Two nights before he had gone to the shelf and taken down her father's razor and looked at it, and told her he wanted to get it ground. On that night he had taken the celd out walking. He again asked the child to go " a- walding," and they went out together. They were seen by Ann Judd, a teacher, who taught the child, going down Green-street together, the child with his arms round his uncles leg, apparently playin with him and foudling him. This was about 6 o'clock. In the course of that night the prisoner sent for Emma Iaw, another niece of his, and said to her, " I have commitied a murder." She asked him whom he had murdered; and he answered, "Our Emma's youngest child." She said to him, "'urely not." Hewas then standing with his hands in his pockets, and his eyes looking very wild. A person came up, and she ran away alarmed. On the day the murder was committed the prisoner was working all dav at the same wheel with a man named Hoole, and left his work about half-past 5 in the afternoon. He returned at a little before 7 cclock, and appeared to be smiling. Hoole asked him if he was going to work any more. He answered, "No; I'm not ing to work any more in Sheffield." Witness asked, " How is that; are you going to Manchesterl" The prisoner replied, " No; I am going toa worse place than hlanchester; I have committed murder.?' Witness said to him, "What doyou say?' He answered, " I have cut my sister's child's head off;" and he then washed his hands in the trough beside witness. Witness asked him what he had done it with. He said, " A razor." Witness asked him if he would let him look at it, and prisoner pulled a razor out of his right hand pocket and opened it and then put it into his pocket again. The prisoner then went on to another man in the same shop, named Copley, and asked him for some tobacco, and stood on the hearthstone and began talking to him. A little boy was sent for some tobacco by witness, and brought some, and the prisoner began smoking. Witness then said to him, " Well, James, you have done the deed; whlt are you going to do?' Prisoner replied, "I don't know." Witness then said to him, "Are not you going to the Town-hall to give yourself up?' He again replied, " I don't mnow." Witness then said, " If I will go with you to the Town-hall, will you deliver yourself up " He replied, "Will you go?' Witness answered, "Yes," and put on his coat to go, and asked the prisoner for the razor, and he gave it to him. It was covered with blood. The prisoner appeared to be sober, and had been working steadily all day. On their way to the police-station the prisoner said he had a good mind to send his fist through a window. Witness said to him, "For goodness' sake, dont" and he replied, "Well, I won't." e asked for a glass of ale in Queen-street, and witness got him one, andhe en said, "They cannot say I amdrunk- for you see I am solidand sober." Vitness thenwentonwithhimto tlieTownhal, where the prisoner gave himnself up. When they got to the Town-hall the prisoner told Copley, who went along with him and the last witness, that the child was in a brick-yard, near Moore-street. He told them that when he cut the child's neck the blood spouted out, and he put his hand to the child's mouth to stop him sci-eaming. Copley went with the police officers to the brick-yard indicated by the grisoner, and there they found the dead body of the chil , in an o n yard, about 70 yards from its father's house. Mr. right, surgeon, of Sheffield, was called in to examine the body, and stated that death had been caused froi.wound across the throat, the head being nearly severed muscles body, and retained oily- by the integumenti and would cause imback part of the head. Such a wound it. He should haVeA death; a razor might have inflicted fixed, and a razor drawiL rai the head to have been firmly inquest the prisoner's demeano-cross the throat. At the When in custody he asked to see Mr-.nerfectly naturaL tendent of police, and then told him, " It was 'a- superinous thing; I took the child to the same place the ,,,rn before, intending to do the same thing, but my hear; misgave me, and I took him home again. On the following night I took him again, and did the thing." Mr. Raynor said to him, " Whatever could have been your motive?' Hereyplied, "I do not know; my brother and sister always behaved very kindly to me." He said he was very sorry indeed for the situation he had left. his father and mother in, as he was their main sunport. His father was 75 and his mother was 65; but he hoped they would be taken to the workhouse and taken care of. Mr. Dunn, the senior surgeon to the Wakefield House of Correction, stated that he had had many opportunities of seeing the prisoner in prison at Wakefield during the last month when he was not observed, and also of conversing with the prisoner, and on those occasions he always found him in his demeanour and way of taldking perfectly calm and collected, dear, and naturaL He had spoken of having received a kick on his head some months ago, but there was no car or external marks of injury. From his conversation and demeanour he saw no appearances of insanity. He said he had no illfeeling whateveragainst the child. He had complainedof a little headache once. This was the case for the prosecution. For the defence it was contended that the total absence of all apparent motive for the act and the foadness which the prasoner appeared to have had for the child whom he had murdered, coupled with his strange conduct immediately after the murder, were facts strongly indicative of a diseased mind. The prisoner's mother and former master were then called to prove facts establishing a defence on the ground of insanity. From the evidence of the prironer's mother it appeared he was the last of 10 children, and born when she was 46 years of age; that her husband's father had died insane, and also her husband's brotherthat the prisoner at times sat and brooded much, and woaul& sometimes when in those humours go off to bed.' Once or twice he had got up very earlv and gone off 20 miles in his shirt sleeves. His master proved that he seemed as a boy to strive very much to learn his trade, but at times he was sullen and brooding, and appeared to be incapable of doing anything, so much so that he used to find great fault with hLim. A prisoner who had slept in the same cell with him proved that at nights he was restless, and would wake uip m the night and get out of bed, and that he muttered in his sleep. Dr. Caleb Williams, principal physician of "the Retreat," near York, for 30 years, said that he had had many opportunities of paying attention to diseases of the hea. Hle had examined the prisoner, and had heard the evidence, and he was of opinion that the prisoner had been labouring under homicidal mania. He arrived at that conclusion from the absence of any motive for the act he had committed, from the indifference he had manifested previously and subsequently, and from the fact that he had no accomplices. Insanity was a disease that frequently descended from the parent to the o£spring, and not unre quently overstepped one generation. It was also commonly observed in the profession that the younger children of a large family were not so strong and healthy as the elder ones. hfr. Kitchen, surgeon, gave similarevidence, and was of opinionthatthe prisoner might have known he was .loing wrong, and might have been able to control his actions up to a certain int, until he became possessed with the mania of homicide, when he would be no longer able to control his actions. Mfr. HADY, in avery able reply, urged thatisuch opinions as those given by the medical witnasses for the defence left society without any safegurd, and contended that all the proceedings of the prisonershowved that he had been able to control himself and knew what he was about; and it was not for them to dive into what motives might have influenced him. The learned JUDGE, hasing carefully laid down the law as to the amount of insanity which excuses crime, read over the evidenee to the jury. The jury retired, and, after half an hour's absenee, returned with a verdict of N1ot GuiUty, on the ground of in- sanity. The prisoner was then ordered to be confined during Her Majesty's pleasure.
NO Ri flT.R .cIR(n'n AYLESBURY. 3ARc}i 12. 'ISI FPM$ COURT.-(Before Afr. Justice WIGmw? and a Speiea Jury.) MORTON V. CU-ES Mr. O'Malley and Mr. Power appeared for the plaintiff, mr. Serieant Byles, Mr. J. 0. Griffits, of the Oxford circuit (specially retained), and Mr. Wroth for the defendant. This was an action to recover damages for two alleged assaults and for a malicious information. The plaintiffis a clergyman, who, at the beginning of the year 1854, obtained the curacy of Little 3fissenden, in Buckinghamshire, and went to reside there. The defendant is a gentleman of considerable property now living at Missenden-house, and formerly a captain in the 55th llegiment. Dnring the greater part of 1864 the families of the plaintiff and defendant were on sufliciently friendly terms. hiowever, in NZovember in that year some circumstances connected viith the Patriotic Ftnd seem to have fanned some latent sparks of ill-feeling into a violent tlsme. A subscription for the benevolent puryose was set on foot, andtheplaintifftook great interest mn its success. A house-to-house collection wvas made, and MKrs. Cuffe contributed 2s. 6d. and Mr. Cuffe lOs. 6d. The list of subscribers was inserted in the local pa2per, and Captain and Mrs. Cuffe's subscriptions were prOmnently brought forward, the former being descrioed as " late of the 45th or 55th Regiment, although other military men were not narticularly so described. Thinking this to be a reflection upon the amount of his contribution, and under the idea that the plaintiff had had a hand in its composition, the defendant wrote a letter, the terms of -which did met appear, to the plaintiff, who replied that he should band the note to the gentlemen "who so nobly and liberally" co-operated with him, but,for hist ownpart, he must decline all further correspondence with the defendent. Next morning, Dec. 5, 1854, the defendant called on the plaintiff, and asked h-im if he was the author of the statement in the newspaper, in reply to which he said that he was not. The defendant then (according to the plaintiffs version) exclaimed, "Youre a - liar, held his whip over hin in a threateuing man- nr, and, after having 219ain called him a vagabond and scountdrel, was shown out ; and the StorY was;, so far as the lasgngewasconcerned, corrob orated by a 'naidl-servAnt. The defedat met the whole with a flat denliaL. ne, in. deed, did go to the plaintifs house, and told himthe awas mnost uncharitable and ungentlemsanly, whereupon the f said he was '-' a dirty, sneaking fellow, and had toir Butler to com-plain about a sermoln To this the defendant merely replied, " Did you consider nie x dirty, sneaking fellow wlhen I lent you 5K. to pay your car weuter ?" and, withont flourisliun any stick, NOf 'e house. -,.ns the firet assault. U- > ee,on took pLace on the ame day, in the road, the plaintiff aying tlt the defendant swore at him, and the defendant tht the plaintiff abused hia, -each, of course, being, according to themselves, perfectly calm and quiet. The second assault wa corroborated ba a person looking over a wall, who said that the defendant was " wavering his whip, as ithe was laying down the Llaw." After this there was a cessation of active hostilities for a year, but things were not comfortable. The captain thonght the clergyman "preached at him ;" the cle'rgyman was confident that the captain sent him scurrilous letters. As the learned Serjeant aid, they were like the squire and the parson inthe Spcator-,wherethesquire refuses to go to churchtospite the parson, and the parson, in requital, threatens to "prat for the Bquire in the face of the ocngre-gation." On the 7th of December, 1855, an open rupture was come to. The captain and his wife were out riding, when the plaintiff overtook them (this is the defendant's account), puled up his horse, looked round in their faces, in a most iolent manner, and passed on. Shortlya fter they again came upon one another, -when the &lainti shook his stick at the defendant, and said, "You're a - blackguard, and I will summon youbefore 3ir. Carrin'ton." The defendant said merely," WVhom do you call a blackguard r" but, the lady acting as peacemaker, they separated On the following day the defendant and his wife were again out riding, on their proper side of the road, near the .hedge. The plaintiff again rode up, pushed byMrs. Cuffe, and, checkin hils spoed, exclaimed, " You aTre a pair of blackguardsneither gentleman nor lady has entered your house since you have been there, and Mrs. Cuffe has been writing to the archdeacon's wife." The defendant answered, " You're a scoundrel, and deserve to have your gown taken ofE Mr. Drake knows you to be a - blackguard, and ba - but I'll smash you before I leave the parish," and then hit the defendant's horse, which swerved. This version was corroborated in every detail by Mrs. Cuffe. Upon this the defendant made an application to the magistrates to protect him from the plaintiff's violence. The hearing was appointed for the following January, the 17th, before which day, however, the defendant had consulted an attorney, who advised him to bring an actionL in the County Court instead, in order to give Mfr. Morton an oppor. tunity of being heard ulon oath. At the triaL at the County Court the plaintiff flatly contradicted the whole. HIs manner, he said, -was perfectly inoffensive; but as soon as he overtook the defendant he cried out "You're a - scoundrel, and your little woman a - wrinkled-. " On the second occasion also the violence was all on the defendant's part. In fact, he (the plaintiff) was quite calm, and " never uttered an oath in is lfe." The verdict of the jury at the County Court was for the present plaintff: Considerable excitement and irritation followed the trial, and on the 19th of January the captain wrote a letter, signed with his own name, to the Backs Chronicl, begging to call attention "to the very indelicate and dis-raefu demonstration on the part of the clergy of the distriet at the late triaL Would it believed no less than from 10 to 15 of these preachers (whose mission is peace and goodwill to all men) rushed into the body of the court, taking possession of every available seat, doubtless with a view of influencing judge and jury, sympathizing with a man they knew was wrong?

Now,Iask you, Sir, or any unbiassed reader of this, could a man with a spark of religious feeling be on terms with one who on the Lord's-day preaches against drunkenness, and yet frequently commits himself ? orvwith another who enters upon his holy mission armed with a gun, a fishing-rod, aud a short black pipe?" He then adds some letter, in which it a,ppears that heihad formerly conferred some kind attentions upon Mr. Morton; for instance, lending him wine to entertaim a noble lord, &c., and, disclaiming all nalice, complains of the proceeding in the County Court. He then goes on, " For 20 years or more I mired with officers of the army and navy and gentlemen of different professions, but I have found that the parsons of the Established Church excel any other clas in corruption, debauchery, immorality, sensuality, vindictiveness, slander, peijury, and depravity, and religion is used as a cloak for theirvies. The foregoing assertion, sweeping as it appears, is proved by the polce reports" Hethenadds, in a postscript " I recommend the perusal of Cobbett's Legacy to Parsons to every layman.

'HOME CIOUIT. MAIDS1ONE. MAmea 13. The civil business was concluded this afternoon, and Mr. Baron Alderson then proceeded-to -tryprisoners. Mr. Serjeant Gaselee has also been engagedduringthe last two days in assisting to dispose of the gaol calendar. (Before Mr. Baron A1DEaSON.) Augustus Federick Turner, 24, and Yenry Bedwell, 39, surrendered to take their trial for the manslaughter of William Stenson. 3Mr. Campbell conducted the prosecution ; Mr. G. Denman appeared for Bedwell, and M&. Rose for Turner. The circumstances under which this charge was preferred were of a very peculiar character. It appeared that the defendants were engaged as army surgeons at the ME1itary Rospital at Chatham, aud the deceased was a privatesoldier. He had been suffering from a wound in the leg, but was considered convalescent, and he was to have left the hospital on the 11th of February. On the previous evening Mr. Turner, who was then upon day duty, ordered the deceased a back draug7ht, ad he proceeded to the surgery, accompanied by a private soldier, who acted as hospital assistant, to procure it, and it appeared that, instead of taking up the bottle which contaied the black draught 7mixture, he laid hold of a bottle which contained opium, and poured a dose from it, under the belief that itwas the black draught. The opiurm was administered to the deceased, and two or three hours afterwards he became very ill, and the other defendant, whose duty it was at that tine to be upon night attendance, was called, and he immediately went to him, and it appeared that he imagined that he was suffering from a fit of some kind, and prescribed accordingly, but the deceased died in a very short time. The only evidence in support of the charge against M£r. 2Bedwell was tlat he had neglected to discover that the vessel in which the opium had been administered to the deceLaed contained that ingredient, a7nd not a black draught, and with regard to ir. Tarner it appeared that, although he bad undoubtedly taken up the bottle which contained opium, under the impression that it contained the black draught miiture, yet it aplpeared that on the same afternoon the hospital assistant had replenished the opium dispensing bottle in the surgery from the storebottle, and that, instead of replacing the store bottle in its proper place, he had incantiously left it in the surgery, where it had nobusiness to be; and it also further appeared that this store bottle of opilm and the one which containedthe black draught mixture were very nearly alike in appearance and size, and couxldbe very easily' mistaken for each other. Upon theae facts it appeared tnata coroner's jury had returned a verdict of manslaughter against the defendants, and it was also stated that in consequence of the transaction Mr. Bedwell had been dismissed the service. Both the gentlemen a- peared to have performed their daties in a most creditable I and honourable manner up to the period of the unfortunate occurrence. Baron ALDERSocZ, upon hearing the opening of the case| bythelearned counselfor the prosecuion, expressedhis opinion that there was not atittle of evidence against MIr. Bsedwel], as it was qnite clear that he had done nothing that in any way tended to occasion the death of the deceased, and the case against Mr. Tuzner was alone proceeded 'with. The evidence of the witnesses did not in any way alter the facts as above detailed, and when Mr. Rose had addressed a few observations to the juy Baron Alderson interrmttedhcm, andinquiredof them himself whether they thought they could return a verdict of manslaughter uponthe facts before them. It was clear that the two bottles (they had been both produced and exibited to the jury)-one of which contained the black draught and the other opium-were so much alike that they might easily be mistak-en for one another, and, althougb, if it had been the ordinary course to keep them both in the surgery, he should have told them that it was Mr. Turner's duty to take care that he made use of the right one, yet here it was shown that the opium bottle had no business in the surgery, and Mr. Tumner htad no right to imalgine that it was there. It appeared to him, therefore, that the untfortunate occurrence was putrely the result of accdent, and, if there was blame attached to my one, the m3an who improperly left the opium bottle ir the surgery was as much to blame as any one else. The jury said they quite agreed in the view of the case taken by his Lordship, and at once returned a verdict of Lvot Guaty. Baron ATnxRsos immediately ordered the defendants to be discharged, and at the same time said he was very sorry that Mr. Bedwell had been dismissed from his situation under such cirumstances, and he corsidered it a very great inJuste. It was explained tha T he reason why one of the defendants only was disuissed the service was that he did not hold a commission. Mr. Turner, who was a cormmissioned officer, could not be dismssed the service, accept- under the sentence of a court-martiaL - M1ACH 14. - (Befo-e Mr. JusticC COLMIDGk.) THE Pu FIGHT AT DARTFORD. Mlichael Madden anad Jeremiah qoon surrendered to take their trial for the manslaughter of John Jones. Mtr. Bodkin, Mr. Bibton, and *1, Campbell conducted the prosecution; Mr. Kennedy, wE? irapecialiy reWined, and Mr. arrison appeared for the -psoners. This charge arose out of the pri&;fight that tok place in the Dartford-mazahes on the 1lth o£f December lt. The prsoner Madden and the djoeaeg4 rre the priacipALs on the occasion. The other prisoner, Noon, wa idd&n7s recond, and two men, named Thomas Sayers and James Massey, weere the seconds of -the deceased. The two latter were included in the chre, but they did not appear to take their trial It wil be remembered that on the day mentioned Madden and his antagonist went down the river in a steamboat, in wvich there were about a thousand other.persons, and the whole prty alighted at Long-reach, and a nng was made, and the &ght commenced and -coniiniit for about three-quarters of an hour, and it was represen_ *that the deceased had the best-of the fight until the last =2i, -wthen the decaaed was either knoclked down or fell, an1Trexved an injurv upon hi head which rendered hins imniediately-iwnensibk, an4t he continued in that state until his death, which took plae a2 oclock on the following mornin . The witnesses who were exnined.for the prosecistio evidently gave their evndenoe very unwillingly and none of them would even g8 o far as to gwear that dden w the Tn who was erad in the conflict with the deceased. They also stateIt u during the last three rounds this prisoner was in such an exhausted state that he was unable to strike a blow; and they declared that the deceased, who was quite strong and lughing at the tine, in the lmt round juped back from Madden as a sortof feint and in so doing3pped and fel} ani in falling struck his head against one of the stakes of the ring, and thus received the injury which ocasoned his death. Mr. Justice COLERIDGE inquired of the loarned counsel for the prosecution, in the courar of the case, whether they were pr_,pared to bring forward any further evidence as to the cause of death, and he was informed that they were not in a position to do soj The learned JuGA, upon this, aid-that, whatever opinioc they might form in their own minds in reference zo the case, they must deal with it as they wrould with any other, and act only upon the evidenoe laid before them, and it a.ppeared to him that upon thefacts efore the Court there ws nothing to justify the jury in finding the prisoners, or either of them, guilty of the e of manslaughter. There was not only no proof of the identity of the prties, but even if that had been proved the evidence tended to show tihat the death was the result of an accidental fall, and not of any act of violence on the t of M wadden, ho was alleged tohave been the princpal in the affair The jury conse quently returned a vedict of Nlio t Gmi1ty, and the prisoners werer discharged.

The only point in the case was whether the schooner exhibited a proper light for a vessel at anchor, and it was sought to be proved, on the part of the prosecution, that such a light was shown upon the occasion. The evidence, however, upon this tubject erv and one or two witnesses ststed cotiven'tha tiheraehictory been any liglht on board the schooner they must have seen it, and they obeerved no light of any kind. Baron ALDERsoN expressed his opinion to be that the charge of manslaughter could not be supported u on the facts as they appeared before the Cout, and he at the tame time said that the unfortunate occur;rence appeared to him to have been purely the result of accident. The jry concurred in this view of the case, and at once returned a verdict of Arot GuU4y.
OXFO3DI CTR^FlfrP STAFFOED. 1Ca0 13. mie ecomnmission for this county was opened yesterday by Mr. Justice Cresswell with the usual formalities. Tlis Lordship this morning attended divine service at St. 3Mry's.

CrIL CouRT.-(Beforc Mr. Juuice CBEssw 3 aE, Common Juris.) The cause list contains an entry of 25 causes, 6 of which are marked for special nries. ne of them, the case of " Swinfen v. Swinfen," is an 3ssue.directed by the Master of the Rolls to try whether the late Samuel Swinfen of Swinfen-hall, in this county, was im a stte of mind to ba capable of making a-will which he executed afew days before his death, in July,1854. fr. WHrssoR7: stated the Attorney-General nd Sir I. Thesiger had been specially retained for the parties, and, oa his application, the cause wras appointed to be taken the first on Saturday. -:CIIrAn SCIJDAORE V. CRIDLID. Mr. Keating, Q.C, and M1r. Phipson appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr. Kettle for the defendant. The plaintiff in this action, J. ScudamoTe, -was a saddlemaker at Walsall, and he sued the defendaut, J. Cridland, l collarmaker at the same place, to recover damages for malicously and without probable cause causing the plaintiff to be taken into custody and taken before a magistate tha next day, upon a charge of stealng the defendant's horae mad phaeton. There was also a count for faLse imprisonment. Thedefendantpleadedonlythe generalissue. Wr. KYATMG, in opening the case, stated that on the Ith of December last the plaintiff and defendant, with two 3ther persons, agreed to go together in two pnhaetons to a ,oursing meeting at a place called the Four LJrosges. The parties were together during the day, and on good terms, mad afterwards dined together at anordinary. Theplaintiff lad taken more than enough wine, and, wishing t Jplay a rractical joke on the defendant, he paid the ostlev at the In. and, getting into the defendant's p1haeton, he drove of the ftowards home, leaving the defendant behind. When away vith rived at Bloxwich, he gave the phiton to phaeton, andfouilwan Inn, and told him he hadrn the plaintif he called aWpaut soon arrived in the ether tody, upon the charge of st~.Lbut~, being irritated with The plaintiffexpostulated, but ti gave him !nt custhe charge. - ceand phaeton. Mfr. Justice CREUSSWXLL inuiared whether theofted in had drunik as much as the plamtiff7, or more. Yjlr. EIflG said he could nottell. Mr. Xn-E said both parties had drunk as much as could. Mr. Justice CiR-sswEri-And more than they ought.: Mr. KxATmiG said the result was that the iilaWtiff -ws locked up the whole of a cold night in the month£f December in a felonxs cell, and the nertmopgiie the OMndant and his attorney came tothe cell andsaid tlieyrqnd-letthe plaintiff out of prison if he woald ignapapernit totake any proceedings. The plaintiff refused. to do this, aid be was then taken before a magistate, and! afterwards before the magistrates at petty sessions, rhen he was discharged. An application was subsea,nently made to the defendant to make compenationl, but, the plaintiffSs terms not being acceded to, the wresent action was brought. Mfr. Justiic, CBn;SSws.. asked vrhether it was really necessarythat the time of the Court should be occupied withthis case. A proposal was then made to the plaintiff to withdraw a juror, but, this proposal not being acceded to, the trial proceeded. Several witnesses were then exammed )port of the plaintifs case, from whose evidence it edm tha the parties had tossed for brandy at dinner; hat it also aPpeared that the defendant, when expostulated with by the policeman, had expressed his strong determination to prosecute the plaintihv though it should cost him a thousandl pounds, thoagh when he appeared against the plaintiff before the magistrate he withdrew the charge. MIr. XE'rrni addressed the jury for the defendant, ana said it was unfortunate that both the parfies had taken too mach drink and had played practical jokes with one another, which the defendant had carried rather too far. as soon as the defendant had got sober he withdrew the charge. The learned counsel said he thought it was a mitigating c- cumstance in the defendant's favour that the plaintiff ien drunk had been taken care of for the night. Mr. Justice CRESSW6YTr, in summing up the evidence, said the plaintiff was entitled to the verdict, but the amount of damages was for the jury. Some cases of false charges were very serious, as -where they were likely to be followed by injury to the character,or where the charge constituted a wanton and unprovoked insult; but the jury must consider whether or not the present case was cne of that description. It appeared that the defendant had acted in retaliation for thepracticd jolre played upaon him by the plaintiff after freey drinEng at oinatter The jury foundaverdict for the plaintiff-Damaages, 5L. MWr.KSETTLF asked hisLordshipwhether therewras evidence of malice and wtant of probable cause to entitle the plaintiff to a verdict on the first count. The maatter wvas important, as an action for false imprisonment could be tried in the County Court, while an action for a malicious piosecution couldnot. Mir. Justice CREtsswELL said he thought it was all malice. The defendant had done it in a passion to injure the plaintiff, and that was malice. The verdict was therefore entered generally for the plaintiff. BIRCH AND SONS V. MMuT1MS. Mr. Reating, Q.C., and MIr. Phi'ason appeared forthe plaintiffs; and Mr. Whateley, Q.C., and dr. Somerset for the defendant. The plaintiffs in this action, Messrs. Birch and Sons, were millers and manufacturers of whiting at Froghall, in this county, and they sued the defendant, a young man named Matthews, to recover damages for slandering the plaintiffs in the way of their trade. The defendant pleaded only the general issue. It appeared that the plaintiffs carried on at r the double business of millers and ma-aufacturers of whiting; and the defendant was a young man of 21 years of age, and a clerk to lessrs. Rays and Son, who also lived at FroghalL. The slander in question wE.s spoken-to Mr. Cox, the stationmaster at the Froghall station, who stated that on the 15th of November last the defeudant came up to him and asked whether he had heard the report about the Birches. Ccx said, " What report"' The defendant said, " About their nixing whiting with flour, and beingfined forit." Cox said he did not believe it, but the defendant said, it ws true; the magistrates had granted them a private inquiry, wad lined them 50M. for it, and the Birches had. paid 20L to keepit out of the newspapers. Cox said he did not believe it, and that no magistrates in England would grant a private inquiry in such a case. The defendant upon that said, the magtstrates had granted a private inquiry because of the |plaintiffs family; and he adde: that he believed the report was true, and that Joseph Birch, one of the plaintiff's sons, had once told him in confidence that he was once i fined. It was now plroved that the same report had been previously circulated in the neig,hborhood, and that there ,was no foundation for it. JosephBirh was called, and admitted, on cross-exanination, that he had once told the defendant that the plaintif flour had been slandered; that they were accused of mixing whiting aith their -Bour; and that it bad been tested by Butters in x crucible. Mr. WHATxLzy having addressed the jury in mitigationx of damages, Kr. Jumstiot CRnsswa summe, up the evidence. Iii5
WESTERN CIRO= DORCHEST1R, FRIDAY, AXc]i 14. The commission was opened here on Wednesday afternoon by Mr. Serjeant ChannelL There were four cases in the cause list, two of which were undefended, and the other two were referred. It was expected that there would be a heavy entry, but the cases were either settled or postponed. There were 18 prisoners in the calendar. They and-their offences were-l for rape, 1 for attempting to Poison, 3 burglary, 1 arson, 2 stabbing, 2 concealment of birth, 4 night poaching. Business commenced yesterday, Mr. Justice Crowder sitting at Nis Prius, and Mr. Serjeant ChanneU presiding in the Crown Court. Flora Everett was indicted for administering poison to William Martin, her master, with intent to kill and murder him. Mr. Cooke was counsel for the prosecution, and Mr. Ffooks defended the prisoner. It appeared that the prosecutor was a farmer, and that the prisoner, a girl of 16, was in his service. She was charged with having stolen some stockings; the next morning the prisoner made the tea in the breakfast-room. Mrs. Martih swallowed a little of it, but thinking the taste very strange spoke to her husband, who upon tasting it felt convincedthere was somethingwrong. le caUedin the girl, and asked her what she had pat into the water. For some time she declared she had not put anything into it; at lengbh she said she bad put some soda into it, but Mr. Martin said that could not be, he thought it must be vitriol, and the girl then admitted that she had put vitriol into the water. Upon being questioned as to the reason of her doing so, she sasd it was about the stockings. It seemed that Mr. Martin had. about 261b. weight of vitriol packed. up, as he thought I securely, and put away in the pantry. lurs. Martin was ill for some short tine. Mr. blartin did not swallow any. Mr. rFoons submitted that, Mr. Martin not having swallowed any of the vitriol, the prisoner could not be convicted of having administered the poison. At the same time he admitted he could not resist a verdict of guilty fdr the attempt to administer the poison. Mr. Serjeant CMXNHELL said there was a doubt about it, and as by the recent statute the punishment would be the same, he thought it would be J,etter to take the verdict fo;r the attempt. The jury at once found the prisoner Guilty of the attempt. The prosecutorstrongly reconuu-ended the prisoner to the merciful consideration of the Court. The learned JUDGE said he would not pass sentence till the next day. This morning the prisoner was placed at the bar. Mr. Serjeant CHASNELL said she had been convicted of attempting to administer poison with intent to ldl and murder her master, and the case agaist her was of an extremely aggravated character. T5he offence had been brought home to her upon evidence so clear and conclusive that the learned counselwho had defended her had been unable to struggle against a conviction. Had it not been for the recommendataon of the prosecutOr, and her extreme youth, he should have punished her more severely than he now intended doing. He should sentence her to six years' penal servitude. The commission for Devonshire will be opened at Exeter to-morrow. It is understood that the judges to-day are going to Sir John Patteson's.
POI,CE. GuiMnLu.-George Hutchins was charged with picking the pocket of a detective officer. John Mark Bull, a detective officer in the city force, said he was in Barbican yesterday morning, and was just about entering Sirrell's, the refiner's, when he felt a tug at his pocket, and, on turning round he saw his handkerchief in the p risoner's hand. The prisoner did not deny the charge, and, as he was not known, he was sunmmarily dealt with, by being comnlitted to prison for 21 days, with hard labour. Bow-sTrrEBT.-Mr. JAsr.m-E received the first half of a 101.-note from *' E. F. S. ;" an acknowledgment was requested in T7he Ttimes. MARLBOROUGH-STREET.-Some days ago an application was made to Mr. Hardwick by an elderly woman, who represented herself to be companion to the Princess Galitzin, on the ground that the landlord of the house where the Princess lived had seized on the goods ofthe Plincess for rent, andin addition had taken her own luggage, in which were some inportmt political documents. Mr. Hardviick gave all the assistance he could in the matter by sending Edwards, one of the police constables, to see the landlord, and to effect an arrangement. Subsequently it transpired that the Russian lady in question hadbeen arrested and placed in a sponging-house. On Thu.sday a stately old lady, wearing spectacles and a respirator, and accompaniedby a young lady, as interpreter, caae into court, ana, addressing Mr. Bingham, the young lady said that the real Princess Galitzin was now present, and that, having seen in the publc Eaaers that someboody had assumed her style and title, she a come forward to declaro that the person in question was an impostor, and to warn the public againstbeing taken in by the counterfeit. ' The real Princess Galitzin had never been mixed up with any such matters as those detailed by the companion of 'the sedi-Princess, and it was therefore advisable to make this public disclaimer. MLr. BLoGRr thought the Princess Galitzin need be under no apprehension, now that the affair was explained. The Princess Galitzin, in very good English, remarked that sbe only knew one thing that was certain to prevail and that was truth. It was in vain to try to hide a light underabushel; the light, just as truth, wouldibe sureto shine at last, even as it were from the top of a mountain. It was impossible for the assumed Princess Galitzin' to retain her spurious dignity for more than a very brief season. Mr. Bin cnsar advised the parties to call again when Mr. Hardwick, who heard the first application,; was on the The ladies promised to do so and withdrew, bat they have not since been to this court. 'From " H. F. S." a 10I.-note has been received for the poor-box. MAIYLEBONE.-Mr. LbNG has received from " . F.

"By Eer Majesty's command, " PANM1UR-E." The Pearl, 21-gun corvette. Cantain Sotheby, was taken into the fitting basin at Portsmouth yesterday to be docked for repairs. -'The Chanticleer, No. 8R, steam transport, went into Forts-. mouth harbour yesterday to discharge her cargo; and the Imperial, No. 18S, left for the Thames. The prevailing easterly winds have driven a considerable fleet of merchant vessels into Plymouth Sound. Among them are the steam transport Eagle, So. 71, from the Mediterranean; the clipper ship Heroes of Alma, Captain bNoble, from WVhampoa; the Britannia, Preat, from Ceylon; the Helen Douglas, Welch, from Calcutta; and the French brig lfalherbe, with mahogany and coffee, from Gourves. The gunboat Cormorant was launched yesterday morning at Messrs. Fletcher's building yard, Woolwich, and was -forwarded thence to the East India Docks, to be fitted for immediate service. Four gunboats, the. Goshawvk, Mayflower, Eouisa, and Violet, sailed from Woolwich dockyard yesterday morning to the Arsenal, to bh provided with their stock of ammunition, &c. ; whence they will proceed to Greenhithe to - ba swung, for the adjnstment of compasses, and other regalations prior to joining the gunboat squadron.. The gunboat Delight, of equal armament and tonnage, launched from Messrs. Wigram's, wi steam down to Woolvwich to-day, and be admitted into the fitting basin, so as to be put in service condition with despatch. The despatch vessel Intrepid having been discovered to be ina leaky state was yesterday morning docked at Woolwich to undergo a complete overhaul. The transport Imperatrice.arrived at Woolwich Arsenal on Thursday morning, but in consequence of a heavy gale blowing at the time the boats could not get alongside. She is laden with general military stores, from Deptford, for the East, and after shiDping her complement of ammunition, &c., consisting of about 150 tons, she will proceed to Greenhithe to be regulated for sea. The landing, from the steam transport Imperatriz, of the soldiers' baggage, consisting of about 500 tons, took place yesterday at the newpier Woolwich. The disembarcation of the large body of troops, amounting to 978 officers, noncommissioned officers, and privates was safely effected in perfect order in divisions, the time occupied in landing not exceeding 20 minutes. The Imperatriz being the first vessel which has arrived alongside the newly erected pier wvas detained a short time in the liver by reason of the strong current running down at the time. The wind blewv a fresh gale from the eastwvard, rendering it necessary to anchor and wait the turn of tide. The ship, therefore, grounded at low water- only, and as soon as the tide ser-ved sho was promptly brought alongside. The officers =ad-soldiers are unaninoius in applauding the com. fort snd accommnodation of the Imperatriz. She bas been actively emplo'ed during the great5r portion of the late camnpaign and.. Las carried three complete ,reguments to the East, She conveyed 2,5 infautryand 250 horses of the army of Omar Pasha from Bulgaria to Eupatoria; anda like number of the Egyptian. army from Eupatoria to T.

Subsequent to thbs and almost immediately after their landing, they were en-. gaged in repelling an attack by the Itussians. In the conl veyance of upwards; of 12,000 toops and a large number of ;invalids, only 12 deaths has taken place. LieutenantW.Iambard has been appointed to the pBelleisle- and J.

The foUowing am 4 eipts oE Xwaya for tho put wecek ;- The traffic returns of railways in the united kingdom, published for the week ending March 8, amounted to o74,466L., and for the corresponding week of 1855 to 344;3451., showing an increase of 30,121.L The grow re- I ceipts of the eight. railways having their te . in the metroDolis amounted - for the week en,n.g as above to 159,6731., and for the correspondin seek of lastyear to 150,5831., showing an increase ar. 9,0901. The increase on the Eastern Counties 1rnway amounted to 15656; on the Great Northern to 2,251p.; on the Great Western to 1,6771.; on the London and North-Western to 3801.; on thelonden, Brighton, and South Coast to 1,4269; on -the London and South-Western to 1,4931. ; and on the South-Eastern to 1,7981; total, 9,1801. But from this must be deducted 901., the decrease on the London and Blackwall, leaving the increase as above 9,0901. The receipts on the other lines in the united kingdom amountedc to 214,7931., and for the corresponding period of 1855 to 193,7621., showing an increase of 21,03.f. in the receipts of those lines, which, added to tie increase on the metropolitan lines, makes the total increase 30,1211, as compaxed with the corresponding week of 1855. SCOTTISH CENTRAL. Theoreport of the directors of this company states that 16,725L had been expended on capital account during the haU-year ending the 31st of January last. Thatexpenditure includes 5,986. for additional engines, 1,63B. forworks and stations, 3,8491. for SOadditional waggons, and 1,4251. for law expenses incurred inthe appeal case with the Stirling and Dunfenmline, the costs on both sides faDing on the coinpany. The revenue account for the half-year showed that 70.4711. had been received, against 65,6981. at the corresponding periodof the precedingyear, showing an increase of 4,773l. Under the traffic agreement entered into in 1854, 13,6051. is payable by this company to the Edinburgh, Perth, and Dundee Railway Compaiv, but that agreement is now at an end, being succeeded by a working arrangement between the two companies. The working expenSes for the half-year ending 31st of January last amounted to 24,2551., against 25,2111. at the corresponding period of last year, shoning a decrease of 9551., which, deducted from 2,2241., the increase in interest, Parliamentary expenses, and taxation, leaves the net increase of expenditure1,2681. The system of-maintaining the line by the company's own servan s appears to work advantageously for the company. The receipts per train mile for goods trains averaged 4s. 2d., and for passenger trains 6s., against 4s. Sd. and Gs. 2d. respectively at the corresponding period last year. The receipts per half-year endmg 31st January last amounted to 66,651., and the working expenSes, includinginterest on debentures and preference shares, to 40,2501., leaving a surplus profitof 26,6141. Fromthisis deducted a dividend attherate of o per cent, er annum on the consolidated stock, payable on the 3.st of March, amounting to 25,500L., andleavi ng a surplus of 1,1141., which, added to 4,50G. from the last account, leaves a balance of 5,6201. for the next account. The dividend of 4s. 2d. per share for the half-year on the 5 per cent. preference shares, and of SMd. per share on the 4 preference stocl from the 15th of G3ctober to the 31st of Jinuary, will be paid at the same time. The working agreement with the Edinburgh, Perth, and Dundee Raiway Conpany is now in full operation. The directors expect that all the advantages which they anticipated from it will be realized. Application has been made to Parliament for power to mnake a branch line from the main line at Larbert station to Denny, which line and works the directors ex t to complete for 25,0001. A rival scheme, supported y the Caledonian Company,who have subscribed 30,000?. towards it, has been projected inder the name of the Deuny Junction Railway. It is proposed to start from the Caledonian Railway by a junction at Greenhill, and to proceed vid Denny to the Forth and Ciyde- Railway near Stirling, thus competing with the Scottish Central Railway for a distance of nearly 12 miles. To this scheme the directors are resolvedto offer the most determined opposition. The capital account showed that 1,713,4661. had been received, and 1,768,9831. expended, leaving a balance of 55,5161. against the company, SAM13RE ANID M7EUSE It is stated that offers from very in'uential parties in France have been recently made for the purchase or lease of the above line and branches. Should any offer be entertained by the directors, it is expected that they will submait the proposal to a general meeting of shareholders for consideration mnd approval or otherwise, before they determine npon disposing of the property of the comapany.
