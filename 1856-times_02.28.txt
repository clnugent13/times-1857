It is proposed to establigh an independent joint-stock bank at the wrest end of London for thepurpose of supplying the growing wants of the metropolis, and. as opportunities offer, of taking up the business of siuchi of the private banks assmay deeiroeto mergo their interests. The princples upon which the Directors propose to conduct the business or the West Metropolitan Bank will be those of the most saccessfin of the London Joint-Stock Banks, andt may be stated as follows, Current accounts wi be made up half-yearly, and if the credit balance shall not at any time during the half year have been below £500. interest at the rate of 2 per cent. wil be allowedon the minimum monthly balanoes. If not below £200, interest at 1 per cent. will be alloved on the mhihrum monthly balances, but if under £200 no intereest wil be allowed.

Theundoubted prosperity which has attendedthe ioint-stockbanidng easstern in the United Kingdomn and especially of those banks T7hich have been established in London, gives the beet assuranceof the success of the West Metropolitan Bank. Recent eventshave rendered the present time peculiarly opportune for its establishment. Attention is catled to the following statement. taken from the city aticle of The Times of the 14th of Febraary,18 i6.

Most. chymists sold the almond ravour, and, although there wac a rule in the profession that all poisonmsol& should be. labelled, yet there was such a. difference of opinion as to. what Wmas poisonous that it sonetimes went out without, notice.

With respect to " hair dyes," he. (1r. Taylor) might mention that oxide of lead was extensively used, which, comabining with the sulphur in the. hair, produced a dark colour; and he had known a caser where partial paralysis was caused owing to the absorption. of the oxdde of lead by the sldn. When the hairdye wa& discontinued the effect ceased. As to the colouring of preserved fruits and anchovies, he could confirm the testimanof previouswitnesses, but in the specimens of bread whin he had -examined he had not met -with- any adulteration with alum; salt and carbonate of linift, were sometimes present, but ncthing injUrious. - 'he bread. to whicn he re?erred was of the best quity, .and th sam les were b-t fw-probablynotmoretnanoneor intheyear.

As to coffee, he (Dr. Taylor) consulted by the Government in I , in conjunction Dr. Carpenter, vith reference to the -sale of mixture of chicory and coffee, and from the in Ties made they eame to the conclusioi that t was nothing in chicory to affect the health, and tha in certain proportion it v preferred by the consme to pure coffee.

THE CRIMEAN COMIISSION. Mr. O. STANLEY gaye notice of his intention to ask'the ioble lord at the head of the Government whether the in.quiry ito. the reports of Sir J. W'Neill and Colonel Tulloch was to be open or closee 1"OLCE (COVIJNTI; AND BOROUGHS) BILL. In reply to Sir J. WAsnrsnicr, Sir G. GREY stated that, unless sufficient progress was made in the Army Estimates on Friday to allow the second :reading of the Police Bill to be moved, it would be postponed until Monday. CONTRACTOPS DISQUALIFICATION P-EMOVAL fr. T. MITCHELl, in moving that the order for the second reading of this bill be discharged, wished briefly to state the grounds upon which he had introduced it. He admitted that some check was required upon poli-tical favouritism to contractors, but he thought the propezi check was not that provided by the act of 1783, which eproposed to rpeal, but was to be found in the 'constitional responsibility of Ministers and members of -Parliament.' The act was notoriously evaded, and contrac- tors desixius of sitting in Parliament could easily have their 'contract transferred to a relative or a partner. The case of the late Mr. Soames, which had been investigated by a comnmiittee; was an instance of that kind of evasion.,Mr. Soames held large Government contracts for shipping, and, wishing do come into the house, he transferred them tohis nephews. Anotherground upon which he had brought forward the ~billwas, that he thought it wvas-unjust to preclude any gentleinan from competing with others engaged in' the same business for the supply of an article to Government, because lie was a member of Parliament. His third and main rotmd was, that the present system was detrimental to the public service, because it narrowed the field of competition. vOne effect of the lawr was that many gentlemen had entered the ho'cse totally ignorant that they were contractors, and hadbeen comnpe33ed to vacate their seats. H{e wiithdrewr the 'bill because hie found that, there wvas -astrong prejudice ugainat it n the house, and& he did not wish to have the question prejudged by pressngitforward. He hoped hon. gentlemen would give it further consideration, and that it -would be taken up by 50me one of greater weight than 1imself. The committee to inquire into the whole system 'of contracts, for wich his hon. friend the member for Stoke Mhrr. L. Ricardo) had moved. would probably be able' to ascertain whether any political favouritism -existed in publi departments, but he must say that, .lthough he had watched the Admiralty for 20 years, he had never been able to discover the slightest trace of it in that department. Mr. T. DUNCOlIBE had intended to move the rejection -of the bill, but it afforded him much greater pleasure to be able to second thehon. gentleman's motion. ("Hear, hear," and a laugh.) He differed altogether from the hon. gentleman as to the necessity of introducing a bill of this kind. 'The measure which it proposed to repeal vwas one of which lox anmdWhitbread were the great clhampions, and which was passed by the same Parliament that disqualified revenue 'officers from voting at elections. That Parliament, although come of our great commercial cities were not represented in it, contained representatives of the landed interest, of the br-probably as ready then as now either for promotion 'or for mischief (a laugh)-of the mercantile interests, -nd, to s small extent,- of the banking interest. The landed interest was then inthe ascendant, but nowv what he minght 1cal the countin--house interestws in the ascendant. (Hear, bear.) Althonghi they had adopted the principle of free trade, there was no reason wrhy they shouild sanctiou free jobbery, and he believed they would dv so if they repealed the5cet. (Hear, hear.) Not only would the Government oe importonedfor contracts, hut if those contracts were not -fulfilled the contractorwvould claim exemption from the con-sequences of his breach of faith. He would say to the Government-""I am dragged through the mud for you everydey-can you not grant me a single favourl" He therefore thought the act was equaUy bceneficial to the coiltry and to the Government. Mlr. WALPOLE quite concurred in the observations of the hon. gentleman who had iust sat down. It would never ,do for the House, while it was endeavouring to solve the -difficult question of getting rid of the corrupt influences exercised upon electors, to enact a law abolishng a check upon-corrupt influences that might be exercised upon the e=ected, (Hear,hear.) Unless thehHouse kept itself per fectly free, not only from corruption but from every suspicion of corruption, it would sacrifice its independence and i great measure lose its utility. There wasonepoint to which he wished to call the attention of theGovern. anent. This sub;ect had been brought forward in consequence of what took place last sessinn in reference -o a particular species of Governmenit contracts,amely, loan contracts. The hon. member for Finsbury *(Mr.T. Duncombe) was a member of that committee, which -irrived, although not unanimously, at the conclusion that -engagements for loans to the Government did not come 'withnn the statute of George II. But as the Attorney-General and, he believed, his hon. and learned fiiend the ;member for Stamford (Sir F. Thesiger) took a different view of the subject, and the Government lweret how actnally contr3cting a new loan, he thought it-wrould be right and proper for tule Chancellor of the xchequer to bring in a declaratory and enacting hill to decide the doubt, by providing that contracts for loans made to Government were not, while open to public competition, within the mischief, nor thereforb, withi the remedy of the statute of George IIL He -was as eager as the hon. member for Finsbury that the law. with respect to all other species of contracts should remain in its present condition, hut he begged to press upon the Government the expediency of introducing a measure such aLs he had suggested vwith regard to this particular species of -contracts. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.-I am glad that my hon. friend the, member for Bridport has, in -the exercise of his discretion, vvithdrawn the bill, as I came -down to the house prepared to @QteDagainst the secend readingin theeventof 'ts being .-'d toadivision. I qtuite -concur with my right hon. fUer opposite in the opinion -that it is not desirable to mzako any alteration in the -existing law with regard to contracts betweea public .departments and contractors for the supply of goods, -or the renderin of different sorts of services- to the 'Government. Tlose contracts are entered into by the -simple authority of the different departments, such as the Admiralty, the War Department, or the Stationery-offce; no resolutions with respect to them are submitted to Parlia:mnent, and the departments have power to vary their terms after they have been entered mto, and to grant in-dulgences to the contractors while they are pending. The de1partinentshave, therefore, the unquestionable power, if they are disposedlo use it, of influencing the conduct of the contractors-and I think that Parliament, in 1783, exercised a -wise discretion in imposing that disability upon contractors which the hon. gentleTan proposed to repeaL (Hear, hear.) The provisions # the act of 1783 are liable to -two objections-one is,- that the law is often ren-dered inoperative by 'ieing evaded by persons who, -althoughtheyarermembersof this House, hold contracts but execute them in the name of a partner or some other individual; the other is, that a personsometimes inad-ertently enters into a contract while a member of this House without considering the effect it will have, and forfeits his seat unhnowingly. I admit that each of these -objections has a certain degree of force; nevertheless, they -apply to almost all penal acts. Almost aU those acts admit -cievasions, and are occasionally appliegd to persons who are ;not aware or their existence; hut if -objections of this-sort were allowed to prevail against them, our -criminal code would be reduced to a very smaU zshred. Xroes not, therefore, appear to me thit there are .nny s n - t reasons for overthrowing the policy with regar02the disqualification of contractors which has been adhered to since 1783. My right hon. friend opposite adverted to that part of the act which relates to loan contracts. The committee of last session investigated very fully the law of that subject and its history, but not its ~iohy,nnI cnfess that anything mnore perplexing than *he history of that law it never fel to - my-leot to -xamne. The proceedings that took place when the -act ws under discon and the mnner in which it, has been acted upon render it extremely difficult tIo arrive at the intention of the LegisLature with X5s)ect to loan contractor;, but the subject received great -atteation at the time, as it wa taken up by the Whigs as a sort ofparty trial at the end of the American war. The act has been well known to Parliament, to the executive Go--vermaent, and to all persons likely to take contracts for loans; and, from the date of its passing to the present time -nembeis of Parliament have entered into engagements in a variety of loans, without any attempt being made to apply t to hemu. No one until L-st session ever raised the ques- tion -of its applicability. The reason for this, although not_obvious, -. is, simple. It ws seen from the beginningo thata oiti, fort ' Ioa 'o a of a totally different xiature', boti Mrespects the lar etSthe -case and th chaater and es ence of the- contra, frik i contract with a publie department. A loan contraet 'ii' ,m,erely a'go-between, 'not contrator,. in respict of the nation re-presented, by Parlament on the one hand, aDdcertin- persons -ho wishi'topurchase perpetdarulaDUtieS' Ion the other.- ~he nitionial faith iuiti reaa to isrpotal annuities isengaged by the act of Pnrl mtbtrliarment delegates no. power of pledging it to the executive Goverrnent. Nevertheless,, it is impossible :or Parliament to - ztikes a contract with the Public- for a loan without, aX preliminay xroceeding, - A proposition by an 'indiiidual memEner oY this louse to -make loan murt end:iri nothing, for be -wouldbeunabletosay, "I am in-a condition to prove that there are persons who 'will enter intd the contractwith you upon' certain terms." In order, therefore, that there ' may be soine basis upon which to found, the actios of Parliament, it is necessary that a preliminary proceeding should take place, and Prliament wisely-I may almoet say, neearily-has intrnsted tEe executive Gcvrnmnent-*tthe power of entering into preliminary negotiations for the purpose of ascertainng that -there are personLs ready. to lernda larg'e sum ofamoney to the public upon-certain terms.' Thisis, 'neffe, nearly all that 'IS done at the ameeting at the- Treasvry betwreen the First lor.d and the - Chancellor of the Ex'chfequer and certhin capitalists from the city. They agree upon certain terms, -which are then submitted to Par7liament-for approbation and ratiiicaton; if Parliament think that this prelimnary engagement, made with certain contiictors,representing a lfige numbefof subicribers, consists of term- favourable to the-public, theyistify it, while if they think the terms ere unfavourable they repudiate it. This is the' nature of the transaction which is laid before the House inrthe hanpe :of resolutMons. If the House pass those resolutions a billfounded on them is introduced, defining in precise terms the enga"ement into which the jpeblic entrs, and -to '-which s~ncribers to' the- loan bmnd, themselves. Thus, the contract entered into upon the public and national faith is embodied in an act, and the exec- tive' Govermment haTe no power of varying the terms of that contract. They can grant no favour to any indi- idual subscriber; they cannot place one person in a more favousrable- position than-another. - They are as nmuchibounid by the terms of the act as any one of the public, and, with regard to conitracts of this class, no question oE corruption can arise. Asfaras Iamable to understand,' the decision of the! committee of.- last session is wvell founded in point of law, buat, admitting that there is a. doubt as to the interpretation of the words of the'act, wuhich are not very 'clear, there can be to doubt as to the question of nolc,- or nasto the entire distinction in essence- and in cha=tr between- contracts for loans and contracts for the supply of coal, timber, and other articles to public deartements. My -rit hen. sriendsu tlestedthat, as thequestion ofrawisnot quite clear, it might bedesirabletobring in ah ill-eclarided and enacting that loan contractors are not subject to the penalties ofthe act of 17S3. It apipears tome that the decision'of the committee of last session is ioumded unon ver strong reasons, and I should be much inclined to akow the case to rest on that decision, an,d not -to attempt fur ther' -legislation. Bult, looking at the authority of the advice of my right hon. -friend, 'who presided over the committee; and who -is a ~thorough' master of the subject, the uestion shall receive my most carefu} consideraMtion, although I hope he will excuse me from giving him a definite answer with respect to it at present. - (ear, hear.) I have only to add that the opinion I have now' expressed agrees exactly w;ith that w hich has ben expressed by the Soliitor-General, wvho was also a member of the committee.- Mr; NAPIER sAid,-he had served upon the committee, although he had been unable to attend its last meeting, and he entirelg concurred in the view taken by the SolicitorGeneraL - He certainly thought loan contractors did not conie within the act, but, as'somne gentlemen, highly competent to form an opinion, had taken a different view, it would be -wll-to make the law clear and conclusive. Mr. HADFIELD called the attention of the Government to the necessity for an alteraton in the law with respect to sureties. A surety now had to be recorded as a Crovn debtor, and the consequence w;as that many persons objected to becoming sureties, and the Government very often did not obtain such good security as they otherwise would. Mr. HENLEY said, that he gathered from what had faUlen from his rizht hon. friend (Mr. Wzalpole" and the Chancellor of the 1xchequer that it was tneir opinion that persons contracting for a loan of money were exempted from the provisions of the present law relating to contractors, butthat at the same time it was also desirable to make the Law on that point more clear. Whenever any bill for such a purpose should be introduced the whole question would of course come under discussioj, but' in the meantime he must say that he, did not reognie the distinction so elaborately drawn by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who said that whatever took place between himself and the loan contractor was provisional and conditional on the assent of Parliameit. That might be true technically, but in practice thme Parliament invariably con. curred in the bargain made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The right hon. gentleman had said that favour might be shown in making ordinary contracts, or in varyingthe conditions of themin the course of their execution but in respect to loans the latter case could never occur, as the terms were settled by act of Parliament. The zighthon. gentleman, however, had not ventured to assert that favour might not be slownin the origin of thebargain. He thought it possible-though he did not mean to say that such a thing was done-that quite as mach corruption might be practised inloans as in other contracts, by letting the mini. mntnm at which the Govenment meant to b6rrow leak out. With regard to the statement, that the arrangement between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the loan contractor was only provisional, previous to its sanction by-Parliament, he would observe tnat he was inclined to think that the persons makinv the bargain were responsible to the Crown for the whoIleoan. The CaANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER intimated disent. ' Mr. NEWDEGATE said that, though the law might have been doubtful, the interpretation put on it by the comi mittee of last year had established a precedent satisfactory to the House on a matter properly fallmng within the functions of the House to settle, and no enactment the House could make would be stronger than that precedent, virtually declaratory of the meaning of the act of Parliament. The introduction of an enactment might, indeed, tend to diminish the force of that precedent, and lead to fresh disputes respecting the interpretation of its terms. The order of the day for the second reading of the bill was then dicharged. JUSTICES OF THE PEACE QUALFCATION DILL. Mr. COLVILE, in moving the second reading of this bill, said that the alterations he proposed to make in the existing law were very small. He did not seek to aolish any existing qualifcation save one, vhich was thequali6ceation derived from reversionaryinterest, for, if the property qualification were to be of v alue, it should depend on property in possession. According to the present law;, the qumlil'eation for the commission of the pace in a county now was landed property to the value of 1001. and what he proposed was, that the possession of 3001. i sonal property, or the holding of ny officeundertheGovern ment or East India Company, with an income of that amount, should also form a qualification for a justice of tha peace in any county. Such a provision would have the eff,ct of adding to the comniisiion of the peace a number of indiuals quite fit to become useful and working ma trates. The bill would lik-ewise provide that, as now, attorneys and solictors in practice should not act as county justices; and to give to County Court judgesthe power of tg as magistrates in right of their offices. The bill contiined some other provisions and was permissive in its character, enabling the lords-lieutehant, if they so thought fit, to act on it. In establishing a personaLproperty qualification for magistrates he was orly following the precedent set in respect to that assembly, allowing members to sit in right of personal property, and, moreover, it should be borne in mind that, under the present law, persons not posse_sig an acre of land contrived by a sort of 7locpca by getting a renteharge of 100I. from a friend, or by some other means-to procure a qualfication for the commission of the peace. He thought it would be mor6 creditable to m3pstrates to have, instead of such sham qualifications, a real qua'fication from personal property. If it should be objected that under his bill persons not contributing to the county rates might be justices and bafve a voice in the disposal of the county revenue, he would observe that that was the case to a certain extent at prcerseXnnt, ras a justice in one county might have his qualifica- Xr. DEEDES thought that the hon, gentleman had failed to adduce any adequate reason for the great change he proposed.- There might be owant of justices in articular loealities, and in respect to those laces he shoud be ready to enlarge the power of the lords-liontenaut for the purpose of supplying the deficienc; -but he conceived that to create a personal property qualification instead of .a landed qualihication was calculated to be productive of- considerable difficulty. They had been told that great objection eiisted to the manner in which the county taxation was -nianaged by the magistrates, but the objection would be increased when gentlemen having no interest in the county taxation interfered, as they might do under the present bill, in respect to it. It was said, -that at present justices interfered m the taxation of one county whentheir qualification existed in another; but at any rate, a they were possessors Of landed property, they were likely to be -acquainted with the rights and duties inherent in that species of pro perty. He was afraid that the bill would oy,erate to increase the: difficulties of lords-lieutenant, who now, found it _difficult enough to resist the pressure of applcations from gentlemen to he put in the coimmission of the peace. UJnless he- thought he -should have- the oppor-tunity in comm ittee of making some material alterations in -thebill, he should certainlytake the sense of the House against the second reading. Sir G. GREY said, that though so07e objections might be made to parts of the bill, 'yet, as the principle was to provido that personal as well as real property should constitute a qualification for justices ofpeace, he thought that there should be no objection to take the same course with respect to the present bMi as was pursued with respect to the bill introduced last year, and that the House would permit it to be read a second time.- It had been said that, under the present bill, justices might be appointed who, having no interest in the county rates, would yet have a right to take part in tlhadministration of the funds; but- s6ne discretion on this point might safely be left to the lords-heutenant. He thought that the provision giving a qualification to persons filling certain offices might require alteration; but that was a question for the eommittee. l-r. VSMT objected to the bill, because it entirely altered the principle of the present law. He Lnow that in his own county and in other parts of the countiy,tho interference of persons in the disposal of the- count rates' whentheyhadnosettledinterest the counties the funds of which tbeycontrolled, ws calculated tocreate a great deal of iritation, as such a proceeding was felt to be opposed to the constitutional principle, that those who contributed to the taxes should be the personstodetermine how theyough4t to bo expende&L Zi? thought that if there -were to be an alteration of"thek rs liouldnot beixthe direction of -thepiment bill- but ia tle appositemwy. ---- i. lr.

At the same tinie ho did not, ee Why "attornoYs and solicitors, well versed in the practice of the law, should be excluded from bebig-mde justices.. - , Mr: RBlCEt hh6ht there was no objection to allowing soEcitors to sit on the county bench, with the reseration only,-that they should not in that case piactise in the crijiiinal courts. '3r. EADFIELD said, it vas absurd to exclude roin thh' bench those whose professional habits and knowledge best enabled them to discharge its duties. He was informed that L,ord St. Lt 3ard's, when in office, had put a practising solicitor into the commission of the peace for a county. -Mr. BANES thought the bill would require great con. sideration. If solicitors were to be excluded, it must be done in such a manner as not to give offence to so important and useful a body of men. r1. T. DUNCOMBE objected to the bill on the ground that its effect would be to increase- the number of the sgreat unpaid." The best alteration whichcould be made in the present constitution of the magistracy would be to appoint stipendiary magistrates all throulgh the countryv Great partiality wras occasionally shown by.justices'of thi, pieace. In manufacturing towns, for instance, all dispute: betwean masters and men were heard and decided by magistrates who were manufacturers; and in countrv disricts cases of poiching were dealt with by landed proprietors. In both classes of cases, it was but natural that the decisions of magistrates whose fielings and interests were likey to bias them should not give satisfaction. The only means of avoiding this difficuty and of securing equal and fair 'decisions was to appoint stiper diary magistrates. 3Mr. BWART pointed ont that there was no qualifcation required for magistrates in Scotland, and that the duties of the bench had always been discharged with efficiency and fairiies there. Each county there had a stipendiary lm istrate called the sheriff, before whom came al criminal bus7ness, and this aragement was found to be an inesE-. mable boon to the people. t fr. LASLETT supported the bill, as tending to improve the niagistracy of the country. Milr. MUNTZ agreed that it was desirable to appoint per. .sons to the bench who were best fitted to discharge its -duties -At the same time he very much doubted whether it was expedient to increase the magisterial influence of solicitors. He knew very many cases in which the magistrate's clerk governed the decisions of the bench, and was himselt to all~ intents and PurposeW, the chief magistrate. {Hear.) With regard to thecappomntment of stipewiiary magistrates all over the country, however desirable such a niessurenmight be in some rcspects, it ought not to be for. grotten that the principle of loca1 selfgovernment had ever been held'to be the fo7ndation of our civil liberties (hear, hear), and on that- account he should be very sorry to see a stipendiary magistracy adopted as a general system. The bill was then read a second time. ANNUIMIES BILL. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER, in moving the second readiiig of this bill, said he would take the opportunity of stating the course which he should propose to pursue in reference to the observations made on the other side of the House on the subject of the -liability of contractors under this bilL Individually, he entertained no doubt as to the rectitude of the decision arrived at by tha committee of last session, and he should be very sorry, if the matter rested merely on his own judgment, to take -any step which could be construed in any way as throwving a doubt upon that decision. Nlevertheless ho could not shut his eyes to 4 the fact that gentlemen of great weight and authority in that house were of opinion that the law of the case was open to great doubts. and that it was desirable thatthose doubts shouldbe cleared away by lepislative enactment in one direction or the other. For himself, while fully admitting the force of the argument of the right hon. member for Oxfordshire, he could not concur with him in thinking that these contracts came within the meaning of the Contractoir Act. HIe did not, however, wish "to press the House to an immediato decision on tEe, question, and the course which he should propose to pursue would be to introduce into this bill m cosumittee a clause of indemnity for the subscribers to this loan, declaring that they should not be liable to any penalties under the Contractors Act. The bil was then read a second time. The Consolidated Fund (1,163,005l. Is. 5d.) Bi was read a second time. Time Exchequer Bills Funding Bill was iead a second time. On the motion of Mr. J. FrrI7GERALD, it was ordered that the Committee on the Court of Chancery (Ireland) Bil do consist of 17 members; and that Sir F. Kelly and the Solicitor-General be added to the committee. The House adjourned at 10 minutes before 2 'clock.
.TJYISH D)ISABIITIES. On Tuesday a meeting was held in the City of tondon Tavern of the London tiberalWRegistration Association, and amongthose present there were Wr. H. J. Prescott, Mr. IL Y7. -Crawford, Mr. T. Hankey, MLP. ; r. K. D. Hodgson; Mr. S. Gren-son MLP.P ; . R. Currie, 3LP.; Baron Lionel Fotbschila, lsP.; MIr. J. DiUIon, Mx. J. L Travers, Mr.W. J. Hall, Wr.

Read, Mr. R. Read, MJr. W. Kirkc, Mr. WV. Strode, Mr. G. Singer, MLr. if.H. Hall, Mr. D. Laurio, Mar. T. Christy, &c On the motion of Mlr. i. L TRAYSERS, hlr. H. J. Prescott was called to the chair. The SECRETARY (Mr. Sidney Smith) read the annual general report of the business committee,which was approved and unanimously adopted. The CHAR. IMAN then intimated to the meeting that the subject of Jewish disqualifications would be brought under their notice, and he caled on the secretary to read the report which had been presented by the general committee of the association. The SECRETARY then proceeded to read the report of theo general committee to the members of the London Liberal Registration Association, relative to the representation of london as affected by the civil disabilities of the Jewvs:- " The absorbing interest of the war has rendered it inexpedient for some time past to press the question of Parliementary oaths upon the attention of the electors. The committee, however, avail themselves of the first opportunity offered by the prospect of peace to recall attention to a subject vith which it is imperatively incumbent on the conistituency of London to grapple, not only because it materially affects the actual state of their representation, but because they have voluntarfly adopted a course in refer- encoetoitwhich they cmnnot abandon without injuryto their! character for consistency and discredit to these historical' traditions which have so long and-honourably associated their name with the cause of civil and religious liberty. "The citizens of London have threetimes successively returned Baron Lionel Rothschild to represent thentin Parliament. In the requisition in whichthay first called upon him to become a candidate for their suflrages and committed themselves to the issue, they 'declared their object to bothereby to vindicate the principle and extend the ap- I p'ication of the blessings of rehgious liberty. They adopted this important step on no rash grounds. Indeed, they ony'y thereby followed up the will of the nation and the policy of thb Crown and of the Commons, ropeatedly, emphaticaUvLl and for many continuous preceding years expressod by petition and vote. " In 1830 Mr. Huskisson advocated a petition for Jewish emancipation, signed by the MIayor, corp,oration, everyf banker, every considerable merchant, and some clergymen of the established church of the town of LiverpooL In April of the same year his colleague Mr. Grant (now Lord Glenelg) carried the first reading of a bill for the removal of Jewish disabilities by a majornty of 18, the present Earl of Derby voting in the majority. On The 17th of MJay Mr. A.Baigprsete a eiinsgodb 400o the ch ief dtizns o Lonon i suportof & bDI Onthe 14th of December Lord Bexley. the great patron of all Christian rligious objects, -presented to te House of Lords and warmly supported apetitionto the like effect. " In 1833 a similar bill was carried through the House ofI -Commons- by a majority of 137, with the support of te advisers of the Crown. In 1834 a Jewish Disabilities Reief Bill was carried triumphantly through they House of Cent' mons by laeo majonties, 23,398 of th chief citizens of London, 7,000 of those of Westster, and 6,200 of those of Edinburgh having supported it by petition. Tho Lord Chancellor tcok charge of Th measure in te Upper House. In 1836 the success of the measure in the Commons was so decisive that the opposition had dwindled down to 22, the constitutional advisers of the Crownbeingamongthe eanest supporters of the bill. " Meanwhile, in 1835, Jews were rendered eligible to the office of sheriff. The Sovereign, the head of te establshed Christian church, has appointed Jewish gentlemen for high sheriffs of Kent, Sussex, Surrey, Devonshire, and Bucks, while the Christian communities of London and Middlesex have, in reference to these counties, adopted the example of the Crown. In 1846 Jewswere admitted to municipal offices -on the motion of the then Lord Chancellor, and many hava been since elected by their Christian fellow-citizens-MIr. Salomons, the present Lord Mayor of this chief city of the empire, being among the number. - - '-In 1847 the House of Commons by a uiajority of 73 amirmed the principle of Jewish emancipation. - " In84S the third reading of a bil for that object was carried by a majority of 61L - - "In 1849 the second reading of a like measure had a majority of 93. " In 1S;0 Mr. HUme's motion to have Baron Rothchild sworn on the Old Testament was sustained by a majority of 54, and a subsequent motion of the Attorney-General pledging the House to adopt a Jewish R;elief Bill next asession h;ad a majority of 36.' " In 1851 the first readiu of that measure was carried by a zealotyof , aid in-1252the third reading was car- ried* without a division..| "In185a similar measure passed the Commons by a majority of 58. -"Amnong the moat zealous promoters of Jewish Emancipation in Parliamentwere the gteatest of our tatesmen, and comprised Messrs Hijakisson, Grant, Canning, the Barings, LordG.Bentinck, the Duke of Sussex, Lord MIelbourne.

He must. say that he had never ebnsidered the case in their favour so strong until ho had heard the extreme weaknes of the arguments which the previous speaker had offered against it. (Hear.) It was impossible to consider the detail of facts set forth in. their admirable report, which.be hoped would be~ unanimously adopted, without feelin- a conviction that the aggeso a al oni the side of ther ojiponents, and the forbarance all upon their own side.

After a few words from Mr. T. Christy, Mr. Travers, and 1r.

It was not very m~any years since Mlr. Batenman was excluded from mnnicipal and many other offices on account of his religious opinions, and that gentleman, having obtained liberty for himself, now came forward to paralyze their efforts, in endeavouring to obtain the samne measure of justice for their Jewish fellow-subjects.

JNEW PALACE AT WESTNINSEBR TO TEHE EDITOR OF THIE TIMES. Sir,-I do not intend to be drawn into a controversy by the letter of Mr. James Walker, in this day's Tines. I will merely state that I am confident I am not mistaken in asserting that Mr. Walker has been paid by commission upon more thanoone of his public works. If he is not paid upon thatprinciple at present, hd can best explain vwhen and under what circumstances the change was effected. I am, as I ought to be, satisfied witli his admissions as to the share which I had inathe direction of the works in the river tembankment at the Nevr Palace at Westniinster- but I am certainly sm-prised at his want of recollection of ihe mnodifications which I caused to be made in that work, as alluded to in a formerletter.

ZONDOR, 2HUBSDAY, FEBRUABY 23, 1M. I ni the house of Conunons yesterday, on the order for the second reading of the Contractorse Disqualification Removal Bill, !IVr. Mlrrcnu, after stating the reasons which lad induced him to introduce the bill-that the present law 'was evaded, that the proper constitufional check should be the responsibility of the Minsters of the Cxowx, and that the exclusion of contractors from the Hoius narrowed the field of competition, and to that extent operated to the detrimentof the public service-said that, as he fouid there was a strong prejudice against the measure, and as Mr. RrCAnDO had annotmced a inotion for a committee to inquire into the whole subject, ha maoved that the order be discharged. M£r. T. DUN-cor, who had given notice of an amendment to defer the second readin for six months, seconded the motion of Mr. W errB:, arguing strongly againt the policy of repealing the present law. Mr. WA'or, concurred -with Mr. Durcomsz, that, while- the Legislature wvas strengtheng the law against the corruption of electors, it should takle care not to relax it as regarded the elected. 'With respect to contracts for loan.; the committee of last year had reported that these contacts were not within the scope of the existing law; but there was stil a great diversity. of opinion upon that point; and he thouceht it would be proper to bring in a declaratory and enacting bill, removing all doubt that t.he particular species of contract, between loan contractors and the Government, was not within the provisions of the statute. The CmicErorto of the ExOnQUZR said he was glad that the. bil was withdrawn. ie thought it was not desirable to alter the law as to contracts with different departments which were not submitted to Parliament, those departments having power to vary the terms of the contract and to grant indulgences, tnereby influencing the contractor. The objections to the present law, that it was not difficult to be evaded, and that sometimes persons inadvertently entered into contracts while membersof theHouse,andthereby incurred penalties, applied toalmost all penal statutes. As to Joan contracts, the committee of last session had come to the conclusion that they were of a totally different nature from the other. LIoan contractors were miere go-betweens, the partiesbeing theExecutive Government and the public; the negotiations with the loan contractors were prelminary only; they were not completed until sanctioned by Parliament, and until the engagements, binding on both parties, were carried into effect by an act; and theExecutive Government could not vary the terms of the contract. In his opinion, the decision of the committee was well founded, and he was diBposed for the present to let the question rest upon that decision. MIr. NT.A'mp, 2r. HAJFLLD, I&r. HLEiaxx, and Mr. NnwDEGATz made a few remarks, and the order was then discharged, so that the bil is withdrawn. Mr. COLviLE, in movingthe second reading of the Justices of the Peace Qualification Bill, stated that its object was to enlarge the qualification and to extendcit to personal property. MIr. DsEDEs regretted that he could not support a measure for substituting personal for propery qualification, which would, in his opinion, give rise to difficulties. Sir G. G:uY said, although objections might be taken to some parts of the bill, they might be removed in committee, and he did not object to its principle, that landed property should not be the sole qualification for the office. AIr.' VAsrmrA opposed the bill, which was supported by Mr. K. SEymxR, and, after a short discusion, it was read a second time. On the ordcr for the second reading of the Annuities Bill, The Cn.&crELLoE of the ExcnzuOuu, adverting to the debate upon the first order of the day, repeated that he had no doubt of the rectitude of the decision of the committee of last year; nevertheless, he could not shut his eyes to the fact that persons of great weight did entertain doubts upon the point, and it was necessary to clear up those doubts one way or the other. He proposed, therefore, to introduce into this bill, whenin committee, a clause of indemnity for subscribers to the existina loan, which would not throw any doubt upon the decision of the committee of Iast year. The bill was then read a second time, as were the Consolidated Fund Bill and the Exchequer BilLs Funding Bill; and the House then adjourned, at 10 minutes to 2 o'clock.
As all deeds of arms are performed for the purpose of gaining a better position in the negotiations which imust succeed them, we may look on the Plenipotentiaries now assembled at Paris. as representing the exploits, the sacrifices, the re- I sources, and the preparations of their respective countries. Each has taken his seat with an accu- rate knowledge of what his nation has lost or, won, and how far future hostilities will add to or lessen its power. Lord CiAF.ENDox is aware that he spealks for a people who have done much already, but whose spirit, now thoroughly roused, and whose resources, still undiminished, will enable them far to exceed their former services to the cause. The French Minister of Foreign Affairs can rely on the proved efficiency of his SovxaoiGN's troops, and point to the Russian territory which they occupy or threaten. Austiia can tell of her tranquil provinces, her numerous army, commanded by Generals in the prime of life, and habituated to war in two melan- choly but instractive campaigns. Even Turkey I can say that she has fought not ingloriously ; that, at any rate, there is life and hope for the Ottoman' State; and that " the sick man" is not yet doomed to die. Finally, Russia will come before the Conferences with precisely the weight which is her due. A people who can fight obstinately and negotiate astutely can never be without importance. The determination to make no peace without adequate security for the future is a proof that the Western nations justly appreciate the resources of the Russian empire and the ambition which has hitherto used them for the disquiet of Europe. Whether the CzAR will gain anyhming by his stubborn retention of the northern forts and his late success at Kars remains to be seen; but we cannot doubt that his Plenipotentiaries will make the most of these two facts, which, in the spirit of selfconsolation which seldom fails a nation, are believed by Russians to coNpensate aU the humiliations of the war. As an armistice has now been signed, and for a month at least Russian shells will cease to annoy the occupiers of Sebastopol, and the Turkish Contingent nwill absti from skmishes with prowling Cossacks, we may venture to regard Europe as temporarily at peace, and assume that each nation is desirous of tranquillity and the common good. In these circumstances it is allowable to call attention to the points which alone can impede a settlement, and to inquire how they can be best arranged. It is perfectly plain that in this matter France and England wvant nothing for themselves. They neither have nor desire to have any possessions on the shores of the Blaclk Sea or even in tle neighbourhood of the Straits. All that they can gain by the most complete success is the same extension of commerce which will still more largely benefit the Russian empire. The security and improvement of one of the finest regions in the world, the elevation of several millions. of the human race, the quiet of the great community of nations, are the ostensible objects of the allies, and their sincerity is proved by the impossibility of their gaiuing any further advantage. When, therefore, in a dispute it is evident that one party can have no selfish aims, it must be presumed that the other has no just ground for opposition. All that we seek to obtain has been admitted by Russia as expedient in principle. The Cn-n states his desire to see Turkey prosperous, the Christians contented, and the world tranquil. The best manner of accomplishing these objects has been decided on by the allies. It is to banish military force from the inland sea which lies between the arsenals of the Czk& and the capital of the SuLTAN. How far this disarmament shall be carried constitutes the chief difficulty of the Fifth Point. The cession of the Danubian delta may be considered as agreed to. Thus, the commerce of Austria and the Principalities wil be freed from Russian restriction, and if the Sulina mouth con-tinue obstructed the commercial nations will only have themselves to blame. The other questions relate to the disarmament of the Circassian forts and the destruction of Nicholaieff as a naval asenal. The strongholds from Anapa to Redout Kaleh have all long since been abandoned, and the ruins are occupied by Turkish troops or the -avage inhabitants of the coast. To rebuild them would cost large sums, to re-arm them would be a work of time, to mrn them must be a standing expense to the empire, without any of the benefits which it was formerly supposed. to confer. It must have been always a -grievous. burden for Russia to maintain herself on all these points; but to bear it formed part of the policy of NIcuoLAs. Wherever there was a harbour or a promontory there he had his batteries. By such means could nations be intimidated and a vigilant diplomacy strengthened. By such means could semibarbarous neighbours, from the mouths of the Danube to the Eastern Ocean, be led to believe in the omnipotence and almost omnipresence of Russian arms. The forts of the Circassian coast were not intended to awe Circassia so much as Turkey and the west. Three years since these forts had a high reputation, and were spoLen of as fastnesses in which the CzAR could defy all the might of Europe. This fame has now been lost. The forts were never useful, and now they have ceased to inspire respect. To abandon them will be a gain to all parties. It will relieve Russia from a burden and from the temptation again to create at some time forbidden armaments. To the allies it will give confidence in the duration of peace, and to Turkey security against even the design of aggression. -The dismantlement of Nicholaieff and the removal of all the vemsels in process of construction is clearly in accordance with the spirit of the terms proposed. This neutralization of a sea must include the neutralization of the estuaries to which it gives the only access. Ships buRt at Nicholaieff ean only float in a sea which is forbidden to them; if, therefore, armed vessels of any sort be prepared, or the arsenals which may complete them be left standing, there can be no conclusion but that at some time Russia is desirous of putting an end to a condition of things which sho has accepted under the pressure of adverse fortune. Let the two ivers bear as much as possible of the produce of the vast regions through which they roll i let the Czsn and his southern subjects convmce themselves by a new prosperity that the great war now about to terminate has put an end to a system as burdensome to them as intolerable for us; let the Boug and the Dnieper be covered with corn-ships, but let Nicholaieff, vith foundries and pontoons, become at once a thing of the past.! The armistice which has just been concluded is quite satisfactory. It would be indecorous that, after preliminaries of peace are signed, after the Russian Plenipotentiaries had been received by one of the allied Sovereigns, and had met their colleagues in the business of the Conference, the armies in presence of each other should meet in conflict. The armistice provides that for one month no hostile operation shall take place in the field. But the suspension of arms is entirely limited to land; every blockade is in force, and any new one may be declared. As a proof that the limitation of the armistice is a reality, we may call attention to the departure of the advanced squadron of the Balticfleet. The Government has very properly acted as if no negotiations were in progress, and such preparations continue for the campaign as may have much effect in- preventing the necessity for it. Even steam transports are ordered to be in resdiness forthe conveyanceof freshmen andhorsesto the Crimea, and officers have received orders to be at their posts at an carly day. On the whole, the Conferences open with every chance of a peaceful conclusion, but this end is likely to be sttained as much by the vigour of the Governments as the genius of the negotiators. Peace wll not come by an unmanly eagerness for it ; it will rather seek those who wfill reject it unlem complete and honourable.
The Peers of England are reconciled, and the House of Lords, no Ionger torn by contending factions, resumes its ease and its good humour. Lord Gs-uivmr. acquiesces in the decision of the Committee of Privileges, and will divide no more. Lord CAmrr iu assures the House that he is no longer pugnacious, and, believing himself victorious, is, with his natural and unsophisticated simplicity, anmious for peace. Lord DERY wishes Lord WEIxsaERALE to be made an hereditary Peer, but admits that he can seee advantages in a Peerage for life; his doubt is whether a Efe Peerage be a sufficient honour for eminence in any professional department. Men of literature andscience are too much absorbed in their pursuits, soldiers and sailors would disdain the honour, lawyers in full practice could not afford to accept it, and it would tend rather to the length than to the intelligence of the debates. Heisafraid of beinglawyer-ridden; but let him dismiss the apprehension from his mind, for recent events have shown that it is the pride and happiness of lawyer Peers to bow their shoulders to the litter in which hereditary nobility is borne rather than aspire to assert the claims of learning and intellect over the pretensions of birth and wealth. Lord WENSLEYDALE is not to intrude upon this newly-established harmony, and Lord CM,7rnnrL will be spared the pain of ordering the room to becleared and appealing to physical force, in order to, vindicate on the person of an old colleague of the bench his own view of the law. In imitation of the Plenipotentiaries, the Peers have proclaimed an armistice, and glad indeed should we be could we hope this armistice mightlead to the rectification of the boundary which separates modem usurpation from antiquated prerogative. We ventured from the first to anticipate that all this noise and fury, this ransacling ofr ancient precedents, and keeping the House up till! midnight, would end without establishing any; right, without settling any principle, without increasing any reputation, and without exciting I any violent public interest. The squabble has | been the topic of the day, but neither side has succeeded in enlisting in its favour popular sympathies, and the people have looked on with wonderful coraplacency and quietude while one branch of the Legisature has been despoiling the other of its rights. But, the sham contest being over, the real difficulty succeeds, and the House of Lords finds that | the struggle on the WENsLmDAL Peerage has only opened the way to a much more serious question-the appellate jurisdiction of the House. The Peers may succeed in excluding everything except wealth from their-political arena, but they must not any longer trifle with the sacred trust they bear as administrators of public justice. On this point they begin to perceive that the, public is entirely in earnest, and that the dream of Lord LmDTnunsT, that after having, by whatever means, got rid of peerages for life, things would return to their old state, is as unreal as those hallucinations that made him during his long political life the constant adversary of reforms he was obliged to adopt, and the unwearied advocate of abuses he was compelled to surrender. The House is about to take measures for reforming its appellate jurisdiction. It is a wise resolution, and one which tThey cannot too speedily or too effectually carry out. They have ended where we imagine they should have begun, and have now at last got into a train of thought which may, if carefully followed out,, lead to great - advantage -to - the public and to themselves. The appellate jurist dictioin nnot possibly remain in its presemt I I I i I i state. . The conurittee about to be appointed must not delude themselves with'. 'the 'notion that trivial changes will do. It is simply ridiculous to suppose that any satisfactory tibunal can be made by a mere reconstruction of the old materiali. The House has not sufficient power and weight, and&no mere re-allocation of parts will suffice 'to give it. Assistance must be sought from without, for it is quito clear that the hereditary Peerage will never supply lawyers enough for a good Court of Appeal, and the' experiment of Efe peerages is, we may presume to say, not likelyto be repeated. This being so, the Housemust seekfor the elements of a Court of Appeal in some other body than its own. The horror of admitting lawyer-an act of migratitude in return for the efforts they have recently made on behalf of the Peerage, of which they are the humble admirers-seems universal, and Lord LANDowI- and Lord DER-aV,: agreeing in nothing else, combine in their desire to exclude as much ' as possible these faithful and valuable auxiliaries from the House. Then, there is the remedy proposed in the House of Commons, which consists in giving the judges of law and equity votes' on appeals; in other words, in creating them a Court to hear appeals from their own decisions. This could be effected at once by enabling the Court of Exchequer Chamber to pronounce its decisions in the name of the House of Lords, and the Lords Justices, the Lord Chancellor, and perhaps the Vice-Chancellors, to exercise-a like jurisdiction over equitable decisions. This would have the advantage of virtually sweeping away one of the Courts of Appeal, and aiding the suitor in his weary course from one tribunal to another, but it would have the disadvantage that the Court of Appeal would be composed of persons fully occupied with the ordinary business of their respectve courts, and possessing little authority or pre-eminence over those judges whose opinions they might modify and reverse. For a supreme Court of Appeal, we should imagine for ourselves a tribunal of higher merit and more illustrious composition, not consisting of the ordinary judges, but of men illustrious among their fellows for learning and acuteness, above the average of judicial ability, and chosen not necessarily from the ranks of the judicature. It is worthy of remark that the judge of greatest weight in the Judicial Commtitee of the PInvy Council is one who never administered justice elsewhere, and who, contrary to the ordinary opinion, has not the advantage of exercising original as well as appellate jurisdiction. To get the ablest men that can be found, from whatever part of the profession-tto pay them liberally-to admit such as are wealthy enough to the hereditary peerage, and to bestow upon those not sufficiently rich judicial titles, similar to those of the Lords of Session in Scotland-to form such a body into a Judicial Committee of the H:ouse of Lords, and thus, while retaining the honour of administering justice, to provide. that it shall be as well administered as possible--seems the most feasible scheme, and one which, now that the Lords have agreed to suspend the WxNsLrxD]AL controversy, we begin to have some hope of seeing carried into effect.
There are few things of which an Englishman has so full an appreciation as the nathual blessings of air, light, and space,-above all, space. He loves a big house. If he is only two or three in family, he is nevertheless not content without a whole house to himnself,-a house, if possible, with the " extra story," with a hundred steps from the kitchen to the servants' attics, with a drawing-room clear from front to back. It must have plenty of ventilation; a greatroaringfirealways drawingthe air from the doos and through the legs of the inmates; and huge staring windows to let in the sum and the wind. A moderate London house, in a second-rate square, would have accommodated half a regiment, nay, a whole one in some oases, in the Crimea. No doubt this national taste contributea to the health of our middle classes, -who at great cost manage to keep up about themselves a climate somewhat less severe than that out of doors. One would think, then, of air and space at least this country would not stint the objects of its charity. Nothing cheaper than space, unless it be air, of which we can have thousands of gallons per minute at any time by opening the windows. Then, why not give enough of these almost redundant commodities to the poor ? Just look at that square. As a measure of bulk, it was stated the other day that the leviathan steamship building at MillwaU was as big as two sides of a London square. We will reverse the comparison, and observe that two sides of the square are as big as the monster ship; yet, instead of a population of 5,000, whichthe ship is to hold, they do not contain in the very height of the zeason so many as 300 souls, of all ages and conditions. From this vastness of space and this scant ratio of population, from bedchambers containing 2,000 cubic feet of air for one pair of lungs, we 'will look to a national institutionSt. Pancras Workhouse-as described in our paper yesterday. The contrast is by no means creditable. In St. Pancras Workhouse the " test," as it used to be technically called, is not black bread, or watergruel, or stone-breaking, or any other trial of poverty, but denial of commion wholesome air,positively foul air, very little of it, and no change of that little quantity. It appears to be a general practice to prepare the air for pauper use by passing it first through those particular apart-> ments which it is usual to insulate as much as possible, for decency as well as for health. The wards are so crowded that the immates, even the sick inmates, lie by dozens on the floor,-nay, they are stowed out of the way, in holes andc corners, passages and landings, where people would least expect them. The doctors are overwhelmed with the confusion, and-what is more serious-find that disorders both spread by inevitable contagion and acquire a malignancy that defies all their medicines. In the women's receiving and casual ward as many as 80 and upwards sleep nightly. Omitting the children, it has been found that every adult has an average of 164 cubic feet, instead of the 2,000 which is the conimon proportion for a gentleman or lady. The air was found to contain a large percentage of carbonic acid gas, -the result of which wasnausea, fever, and of course deaths. -The nurses, and doctors, and relieving-officers, all sufferedL Not only were there no bedsteads, there were not tven beds; and the poor wretches lay on the bare floor, or on forms, sometimes huddled together in a compact naked mass, communicating vermin and disease. As for mothers and infants, there seems to have been little pity for them ; it was no great matter if the childrenwere removed to abetter world. Inthese wards we find 2 per cent. of carbonic acid gas, as decidedly fatal to life, as strychnine or prussio acid. The children slept eight in a small bed, festering with cutaneous disorders. But the men, particularly that helpless class -that cannot take care of themselves, were no better off. We are, of course, not quoting the complaints of any chance informant, any tender-hearted philanthropist looking out for a. topic, but from the report of an inspector sent -by the Poor-l[aw Commissioners. The raen, then, it appears, havo been sFwping in -wl]ars, without chimnep or eveia wiadQws, anu no oomnunli- cation iwi thf,e outer air except -light in the 'door.' A longnlow oom,- 7 fet- 2 inches high, contained 32 sleepers. When :the poor apply for relief they are "'penned"-so ulog and subjected to such pressure, that they. must' be strong if they survive the ordeil aid obtain their wretched pittance. At half-past 5 in the evening as many as 150'were still unrelieved; they had not' tasted food the whole day; and expected none till 7. One relieving-offlicer fell a victim to the abominable atmnophere, of this cellar, into which crowded the applicants, often wet with exposure to rain, heated with straggling, and bringing dirt and disease. Over and over agan complaints had been made to. the late Vestry, without any result; and it is only hoped that the new Vestry, not being quite xo familiar with these "horrible"' scenes, may take measures to stop them. It is clear, however, that this state of things has been allowed for a very long time, and that a parish of not far from 200,000 inhabitants, containing many good streets and squars and rapialy improving suburbs, has permitted the sacred duties of public charity to be conducted little better thai the housing, clothing, and feeding of our armies in the dreadful winter of 1854-1855. But let u3 not be too hard on the humaane British people. We are not entirely without benevolence. It is only in the selection of our objects that we are rather capricious. If any of these mriserable wretches, struggling like sheep through their pens to get a little bread, or lying on the ground naked, and breathing a horrid mixture of air and carbonic acid ga, hlad gone out and taken a loaf from a shop window, or broken a pane of glass, or touched a pocket handkerchief as it dangled from a coat-tail, then he or she would immediately have been promoted to Newgate, or some other of Hxnm MA&=rs penal palaces. If a woman, she might have found herself at Newgate, in lively company, in spacious wards, and with 19 fires employed in keeping up an agreeable and uniform temperature for 13 of her sex, She might have put the City to the cost of some 501. a-year, instead of the Is. 10d. a-week, or some such burden, she has laid on the parish of St. Pancras. No wonder we are pulling down ourI prisons and building larger ones; no wonder that wherever we go we find the pleaaantest spots occupied with huge edifices for the punishment or reformation of offenders. The poor,-for poor there must always be,-are driven by the extremity of their distress to think it a small affair to break the laws.of a community which has so little heart for them. Indeed, they know they are forgotten, unknown, trodden under foot, crushed to death, and rotting in, cellars, where they are, nnd so long as their hands are innocent of crime ; but the moment they come within the penalty of our laws they will become the objects of the most affectionate regard. They will at once have good air, wholesome warmth-in fact, a 'aradise, compared mth their treatment so long as poverty was the 'whole of their crime. Yet both systems-the horrid cellar of the St. Pancras Workhouse, and the well-warmed, well-ventilated Newgate-are under the supervision of the HO= SECREAar, and, need we say, the supreme authority of the same Legidlature T The sooner it sets about rectifying the gross disparity between the treatment of the poor and the criminal the better for our national character, the better for the morality of our poor and the safety of our property, both put in. jeopardy by the existing exaltation of crime over the head of destitution.
We have great pleasure in laying before our readers a copy of the Royal Warrant authorizng the seven General Officers named in if to require explanations from the Earls of Luc N and CARDIGAN, Sir RICIIARD AnLy, and Colonel GoRDoxn in the face of day and in open court. It would be idle to say that no misapprehension on this point has prevailed. Step by step, and inch by inch, the Horse Guards have fought the ground, and it has not 'been until the last moment that they have resolved to make this concession to public opinion. They have decided rightly at last, and therefore we have only to hope, in the words of the old legal formula, that the officers accused may obtain " a good deli" verance." The Crimean Commissioners carited on their proceedings in the ful blaze of publicity; it was therefore impossible that the 31inistry should have tacked on to the first a supplemental commission, which was to decide in secret. The same Court which nominally tries the officers virtually tries tho Commissioners. Sir JoHN ?NxEnm and Colonel TuLLocu are as much upon their trial as the Earls of LurcA and {,ABDmAx, as Sir RIOn.HAD AmLx or Colonel Go0DoN. Every- consideration, therefore, of respect and fair play towards the two distinguished men who were selected out of all England for the performance of so important'a duty as that of investigating the real history of the army in the Crimea suggested the necessity of doors thrown widely open to the public. It is no fault of ours that the Government are placed in the ridiculous position of trying the very officers for misconduct whom they had just rewarded profusely for good conduct. That is the result of our bipartite military system, and of the determination of the Horse Guards to uphold their own men at all events. The position is whimsical enough. Certain officers neglect their duty-Government Commissioners are sent out to the seat of war, who report that they have neglected their duty-the report is held back-the officers return home and are covered with laurels and honours and gratified with promotion in the, service-the 'report is publishedc-and now we are busily engaged in trying these very officers for miscasiduct andneglect of duty -laurels, honours, and promotions to the contrary notwithstanding ! We congratulate the Government that they have not complicated fiuther a seriesj of events already sufficiently complicated by appointing a secret tribunal to continte the proceedings of an open court.

The following is the letter of our Paris correIpondent, dated yesterday, 6 p.m. - The second sitting of the Congress, which was believed to be ftxed for to-day, has not taken place. This fact has given rise to a variety of rumours, which I believe to be unfounded, because of the strict obligation of silenca in all that relates to the proceedings of the Congress imposed on its members. A week at least before the Conferences opened I mentioned that the sittings would not follow each other consecutively day after day; and that two, three, and perhaps more days mIght very probably intervene between two sittings. Neither are these sithngs fixed beforehand for particular days in each wek. They depend a good deal on the progress of the negotiations, and are determined by the Plenipotentiaries theraselves. The Cotstitutiomoe is therefore mistaken in saying that the Congress would invariably meet three times a week. The members do not know till the close of each sitting the particular day or hour at wnhich the next will be held. With respect to the isue of the negotiations ]can add nothing to what I have already said. The public is full of expectation that peace must come of them, and there are few who venture to afrm the contrary. 3fany chances are in its favour, of that there is nodoubt; butuntil six or eightdaysof conference pass over it would be hazardous to anrm anything positively. A private letter from Constantinople communicates the substance of the Turkish project for the Principalities, and which the Grand Vizier, Aal Pasha, Wil have to submit for the approval of the Congress. So far as it is explained the project doe3 not seem to be very regardful of the ancient privileges of those countries, and perhaps a little too m,uch so of the personal interests, that wotla be satisfied if the cnoicebetweentho candidates were left to the Porte. In the first place, I may observe that what is meant at Constantinople by the expression "the country' should not be misunderstood; in the present instance it means the Divan :ad hoc, which I do not believe represents the country in any respect. Again, it is difficult to understand, when the election and the direct nomination by the Porte present difficulties of which the gravity is generally admitted, that an additional complication should be added. The project does not, it appears, comprise the immediate removal of the present Hospodars, andtherefore commences by an act of illegality, as the treaty of BaltaLiman prescribes the period of seven years, -which expires in May next. The Turlish project also proposes the nomination of a Provisional Government, the only effect of which, in the opinon of well-informed persons, would be the commencement of a struggle between a certain number of indi_ viduals, well known for their cupidity, their g.-asping and unscrupulous ambition, and in which the brothersStirbeyand Dibesco, asthe richest, would end by completely vanquishing their adversaries, and by obtaining their acceptance by the Porte, several of whose functionaries they always have it in their power to deceive or corrupt, either by themselves or by means of Russia or Austria. It isto be hoped that the Plenipotentiaries will reject a project absurd as it is unworthy, but which at all events may be regarded as a specimen of -what is to be expected from Constantinople with respect to the Principalities. It seems, under all circumstances, to be indispensable to the satisfactory termination of this question that the Paris Congress should definitively name the Hospodar, and adopt some priuciple of reform in the C-onstitution of the country to serve as the basis of a national representation. On this question of reform in the Principalities it is to be feared that our Plenipotentiaries are hardly a match for those of Russia and Austria. It was there that MI. Brmnow, for instance, began his career as a public man, and during the long period that he was Chief of the Russian ChaMedlleric, under Count Pahlen, he became intimately acquainted with the leading men of the country, and, in all probability, the relations he was then enabled to form, and the influence he then exercised, have not ceased to this day. Count Orloff enjoys advantages similar to those of his cowfrare. Count Buol will probably treat the Mioldo-Wallachian question in an exclusively Austriau point of view, without much reference to the moral or material interests of the country itself, but he will never forget that in the BEukowina and Transylvania are Wallachians Under the Austrian rule; and, if it be trme that M!. de Bourqueney is rather too much inclined towards Austria ou this matter, in the examination of this question the parties are not on equal terms. There is a difference of opinion among those who kmow the country as to the utility of uniting both provinces under one common rule, owing to the rivalries and jealousies actually existing between them. The same may be said of the nomination of a foreigner to the sovereignty, who, it is feared, woull be more easily exposed than a native to the corrupting influence of either Austria or Russia. Neither is it deemed fitting that every question of internal reform should be decided by the Congress. These should be left in a great measure to the eountry itself. It is believed that the question ia occupy the attention of the Congress very soon..

FOBETQN INTELLIGENCE. FRANCE. (OROX OUR OWN CORRUPoMDlMT. .A portion of the following appeared in our second edtion of ye3terday:-] P;AR, TulESDAY, FPm. 26, 6 P.3L A letter fromDamascus states that as soon as the intelligence arrived there that the position. of the Christians was about to be taken into consideration at the conferences of Constantinople the Christian inhabitants of Damascus and of its neighbourhood sent a petition to tho Ambassadors of the allies, praying themn to exercise their influence with the Porte to have a term placed to the arbitrary acts of the Cadis. In the petition mention is made of various habitual acts of brutality of that class of officials, particularly in cases of death, when a number of exactions were insisted on from the families of the deceased, for which the law gave no warrant whatever. The Jews, the petition states, were in. finitely better treated by the Cadis than the Christians. The abuses complained of will be removed by the reforms lately agreed to by the Porte. A letter from Sebastopol of the 12th, in the constitutioand, says}- " A letter from Eupatoria of the 9th mentions the consternation into which the Tartar population of that place has been thrown by the news of the prospect of peace, which will probably expose them to the most severe retaliatory measures on the part of the Ru-sians. It is the same in the valley of Baidar, at Kertch, and wherever the allied armies have come in contact with thenative pOpulation. Within 48 hours after the allies landed at Eupatoria 35,000 Tartars, men, women, and children, with 10,000 horses, 4,000 or 5,000 carts, 150,000 heep, and nearly 50,000 head of other cattle, came into Eupatoria, where there were before not more than 12,000 inhabitants. Their object, of course, was to fly from the Russians, whose vengeance they feared from having received the allies in a friendly manner. From 3,000 to 4:,00O young Tartars have since then engaged in the service of the allied armies as labourers and carmen. Scurvy, typhus, and cholera have carried off at least the half of the Tartars' who had placed themseves under the immediate protection of the allies. Those who remAin are generally of the class in better circumstances, and are consequently the most compromised. Russia wi never forgive them, and feelings of humanity as 'well as of honour cal onthe allies to protect the inhabitants of a country which has justhbeen sulbjected to a 21st invasion.

Nearly al the journals speak of the result of the public bidding for the Valladolid andBurgosRailway yesterday as a great event for Spain, ana praise the Crdit Mobilier Company for coming forward with so liberal an offer, compared with that of the Spanish firms. As regards the offer sent in by the representatives of the provinces of Valladolid and Burgos, it is considered not as a real bidding for the line, but as merely signifying the willingness of the provinces interested to. makg it on their own account if no capita!ists come forward to take it. It has been stated in some omurnals that the Grand Central Railway Company of France have withdrawn from the competition forthe Madrid and Saragossa Railway, which will come off on Mfonday next (the 25th); hut tbis is not the case.

SOUTH AMfERICA. SOUTHAbIPTON,FEB. 27. The Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamship Tagus, which arrived this morning with the Peninsular mails, brings intelligence of the arrival at Lisbon of the Portu. guese steamer Don Pedro IL, on the 21st inst This vessel brings five days later news from the Brazils than that previously received by the PRoyal mail steamship Avon. The dates are-Rio de Janciro, January20; Bahia, January 29; Pernambuco, Januaty 31; St. Vincent, February 11-; and Madeira, February 18. The Don Pedro landed 92 passengers, who had eight days' detention in the Lisbon lazaretto. From Bio de Janeiro we learn that the cholera deaths were 13 per diem. Tho epidemic had appeared at Parahybuna, in the province of San Paulo, as- also at 1batuba. Letters from Santa Catherina stated its existence at San Antonio da Patrulha, 16 leagues from Torres, and it was gapposed that the cholera, which passed from Rio Janeiro to Rio Grande, had advanced by the 3 aquarao river, leaving the intermediate points free from infection. Coffee quotations are the same as those by the Avon, but no purchases had been made, holders being firm. The course of the market appeared to rest with the shippers, who, by holding off and allowing the stock to accumnulate a few days longer, had eveTy expectation of causing a decline rather than the advance which was likely to accompany eager purchases. Freights could not be quoted during the uncertainty of the coffee-market. Exchange, 27i to 27g. From Bahia and Pernambuco no particular commercial or other news is reported. The markets continued without any alteration of consequence, and the exchange at both places was 2SA to 28, on London, with transactions limited The Royal mail steamer Tamar arrived at Pernambuco on the 28th of January, and left the same day for Bahia.

B. Beresford Hope, F.S.A., in the chair. Theousualformal business was disposed of, and a large accession of new members was announced since the L7st meeting At Crosby-hall. The chairman, after abriefbut well-pointed address on the importance of the science of arobmology, cal1ed upon the gentiemen on whom devolved the task of reading papers. 31r. G. Gilbert Scott, ARMA., contributed a most valuable ono on the Chapter. house at Westminster,whichhe characterized as, ofits kinl, the most beautiful example in Enzland. He proceeded to describe the early history and uses to which the building bad been devoted, pointin- out that the Parliament of England had there assemble previously to taking possession of St. Stephen's ChapeL ilr. Scott hiehly deprecated the present appropriation of the beautiful Chapter-house as a re. ceptacle for public records, but expressed a confident hope that the new building erecting for their custody on the Rolls estate in Fetter-lane would free so exquisitean architectural adjunct to Westminster Abbey from the cumbrous and unsightlyr charge it had had the custody of for. so many hundred years. The lecturer's remarks were much apyreciated by his audience, and some drawings which he d, under considerable difficulty, prepared from the original structure, partly conjectural, were regarded with ingular interest as suggestions for future restoration whenever opportunity may permit of their being carried out. Mr. Sydney Smirke, AR.A., exhibited a ;ariety of relics from Westminister-hadl, Temple Church, &-a., as introductory to remarks ipon them. pointing out that antiquities, apparently trifling at times, like chibns, let in a eonst. derable li-ht on the customs of our ancestors or their history. M Mr.ogford read a paper, entitled "lReminiscences of Westminster," including the Hall and the Abbey; folowed by some observations by the Rev. C. BoutDll, on' the " Brasses and Historic Memories of Westminster Abbey." The Rev. Thomas Hugo discoursed on early Britam, so far as ancient Londinium and the district now composing Middlesex are concerned, both in the Roman and pre-Roman periods.. A praiseworthy exhibition of anti. quities bad been collected, to which Lord Londesborough, thepresident, materially added by a very perfect bronze Celtic shield of beautifal design, recently discovered in the county of Galway. The rooms were very crowded, and the kindred societies of the metropolis-the Society of Anti- quaries, tho Institute and the Association, were largely represented by many well-known faces; a numerous sprinkling of ladies was also present. How PETrrio.os ARE GOT 1I'.-A ist of petitions against opening the 31useum and other exhibitions on Sunday, which fills a space of upwards of 100 pages in the report published yesterday, is followed by a very extraordinary oetition wrhich, if the fact, as alleged, be true, would go ?Ar to neutralize the effect of this immense mass of paper. It emanates from MIr. George Jones, of Bristol, builder, and states that certain signatures to the petition from that city against opening the Museum and galleries on Sunday have been obtaip,ed from infants of tender age and pakupers. Mr. Jones prays the House to prevent such practices for the future. The total number of ictitionS, as yesterday announced, amounted to 4,28f, and the signatures to 53l,OOo, whloe the counter-petitions are 106 ianuumber, and signed by 18,54S persons. AccmNT-AL DmBAT By Poisox.-Captain Aquilla Howe Rent, of the 4th Lancashire Mlitia, met his death by poison, administered to him by mistake at Newr last week, Captain Kent, who had been for some time taking tonic draughts, though in general good health, obtained, about a month since, a prescription from his physician, Sir Henry Marsh, of Dublin, which he sent by his servant to Dr. Connor, druggist, of Hill-street, Newry, a fortnight since, and received, together with the written prescrijption, a bottle containin" a mixture which he had been in the habit of talking. n Saturday evening week Captain Kent directed his servant to go to Dr. Connor's and get a mixture made UDp similar to the one which he had previously got, deceawe g hnat the same time the bottle but without gving him Sir Henry larsh's prescription. The servant delvered the mas3age to Dr. Connor's son, Mr. S. T. Connor, from whom he received the first bottle. 3T. Conaor referred to the file to discover the prescription first compounded, but could not find the paper, whereupon another assistant told Mfr. Connor that be knew what it was, and repeated something which the servait did not comprehend. The servantthen left the shop, and called again in about20 minutes after, and received from Mfr. Connor a bottle, whichbhedelivered tohis master. Thelatter did notpar. take of it till 3Monday morning week, about half-past 8. and ho soon after became very ill It became at once apparent that he had taken poison, which turned out to be a preparation of aconite, and, though every effort was made by the surgeonand assistant-surgeon to neutralize the effects of the poison by the admiiistration of Wantidotes, the unfer- tunate gentUem3n died about 20 minutes past 10.

The LoRivXou0thenpropo6e& '"tlieArmyand Navy,"L -whch was daly acknowledged by Colonel WxrDenscaa and AmrlWAs.cOu'. The Lomis Mmzon, in prefacing the slext toast,. Yi, "the Canada Club," expressed the g'eat pleasure it would have afforded I im, and he was sure that company also, to have been honoured with the prsesice of his Exel. lency the American Minister that evening, and -to have testified to him how deeply the inhabitants of thnt metropolis, and indeed the entire British nation, felt interested in the uninterrupted msinteuanoe of the most friendly relations between this country and that great kindred people on the other side of the Atlantic wrhom Mr. Buchanan had so worthily represented during his sojourn in England. (Cheers.) His Elxcellency, however, had addressed to hin on M1onday a very lind letter, expla that a raions summons to attend the hospitable boar of no ess a personage than the Sove. reign of the country would necessitate his absence from that gathering. (Hear, hear.) Every true-hearted nE man scorned to harbour any unworthy feeling of iealousy of thegreatuessand prosperity of our t iansatlantc kins folk, On the contrary, bound together as the two peoples were by the ties of a cominon origin, -common traditions, simnilarity of institutions, and the most intimate commercial relations, the rapid grovwth and develop. ment of the United States excited universal feelings of rejoicing and pride in the hearts of the English nation (cheers); and whatever bij words of defiance might, from time to timne, be heard across the- wide ocean vhich separates the two cognate communities, and however those words might be more or less faintly echoed by some on this side of the water, there could be no doubt that all who understood anything of the extensively ramified and reciprocalinterestsofErglandandAmerica iuustbefirnilypersuaded that the most perfect terms of amity were essential to their mutual welfare, and that a warfare betwesn them would be most disastrous to both and nothing less than a species of fratricide or parricide. (Cheers.) Therefore he could have wished that Mr. Buchanan had been preent that evening to hearthe sentiments of friendship that would have been. expressed on aU sides towards himself and his country, as he would, imthat case, havebeen enabled to conveywith him to the United States, to which he was about to return, the assurance that it was the sincere desire of that important commercial community, that nothing consistent with the maintenance of our national honour should be left undone to insure a settlement of our differences with his country without a recourse to the dread arbitremuent of the sword. (Cheers.) The Lord Mayor then concluded byproposing "the Health of, Mr. Robert Gillespie, and prosperity to the Canada Club." Mtr. GILLJSPIE having acknowledged the compliment, The LOPD 3IAYOTt rose to give " the House of Lords," associating with the toast the namo of Lord Elgin, upon whom he pronounced a highpanegyrie for his successful administration of the government of Canada. (Drunk with ths usual honours.) Lord ELGSS, in returning thanks, observed that it was upon the good opinion of such assemblagges as that which he saw around him,rather than on the strength of any traditionalrights andprivileges, that the House of Lords mnst rely for that moral influence wihich would enable it to do its duty to the Crowin an.d the country in the critical times that might be approaching. (Hear, hear.) Having but lately taken his seat in the Efo,se of Peers he was hardly entitlea to put himself forward as the exponent of its sentiments; yet, he had seen enough of the spirt that animated that august assembly to be able to say with confidence that no movement of opinion in this country of a truly national character would fail to find a powerful echo in that body. Whether the rigidity of our hereditarv system was about to be relaxed, and some infusion of the life-rent element to be in'roduced into it (a laugh); and whether such an infusion, if it should occur, would really do good or harm, were questions into which it would not be proper then to enter; but, whatever might hap one way or the other, on this subgecthere was no donbt that the House of Lords would ontinue to reflect with tolerable fidelity, if not every transient impulse of popular feeling, yet the daliberate and settled convictions of the country. (Hear, hear.) The noble lord then expressed the gratification it afforded him to meet so many members of the Canada Club on that occasion. From his long official connexion with Canada, he could not but feel pecuiar interest in the rapid progress of that important colony. Without pretendng to say that ever law hat had been passed by its Lerislature within theIrst eiaht years was unexeeptionable in its character or such as to command universal assent, still it might bo aofred that in all that essentially concerned the recognition of popular rigehts and the appication of sound prindcples of poltical economy and finance the lahours of the local Parlament of Canada withi that period would compoare favonrably with the acts of the legislative biody of any other contry that could th named. (Cheers.) Yet if his voice could reach his Canadian friends, he would implore thems to remember that E.nglishmen were a practical people, and that it rested with the provincial Parliament of Canada to do more to advance the great cause of colonial self-government by an examnple of the wFise and moderate exwercise of their functions than could poesiblybe accomplished by any other instrumentality. (Hear.) He rejoiced at the conjunction of the Canada Club and the name of the American Minister in the speech of the Lord Mayor, because he had always desired that our possession of the British Provinces on the American continent should ba a bond of union, instead of a source of jealousy or dissension between England and the Government of the United States. (Hear, hear.) The prijciples of free tradehad been recently applied to the commerce hetreen Canada and the States; and the result was, that'the- amount of that commerce, according to the statement of Mr. Buchanan, had since then been quintupled. -By uniting in an amicable rivalry of that description, England aml America could do much to promote the cause of civ-i3iation throughout the world, and he trusted that Mr. Buchanan would carry back to his countrymen his invaluable testimony to the universal desire of the people of the united kingdom to continue upon the most friendly and eaceful footing witlh them. (Cheers.) The noble e,arl conclufed by proposing" Ihlasealth of the Lord Mayor.'

AlImoet all cassesof goods, however, have Participated in the inereased business, with the erception of cotton manufactures, the falling-off in which was to be expected after the extraordinary increase presented in the previous return. It is to Be remarked, however, that this falling-off is intrinsically greater than it ajpears, since allowance must be made for tMe advnce in the price of the staple since the corresponding month of last year.

An attempt was made to commence proceedinigs by taking the ballot on the original resolution, but it was( explained that the second proposition affected the fiist, and that therefore the debate should, be allowed precedence, in orderto elicit the general opinion of the proprietors. This having been agee to, it Jvas contended, on behalf -of thsose favourable to a bonus, that the division shouldbe made in that manner, in order to place them in their jast position, the distribution to. takie effect either in a money payment upon polces, or - in a further reduction of annual premiums, regard being had to the date and standing of the several insurances. Others, who objected to this mode of dealing with the funds, and who doubted thc existence of a surplus in the sense indicated4 considered it would be advisable that the opinion of two actuaries in conjunction wvith the recognized offlicer of the society should be taken, to ascertain if there is reallyany divisible surDlus, and whatcoarse of action should bepursued. It was also urgedthat the plan proposed with respect to a bonus could not be legOally adopted After a protracted discussion, the motion for a distribution as recommended was carried by amajority of 17, the respective numbers being 9D and 78. The decision will, however, have to be subjected to the ordeal of ballot. With regard to the confirmation of the first resolution, the result of the ballot was a majority of 29, the numbers in favour of it being 183, and against it 154

DA&itmG IoBmRY EAIt 1IoTliAm.-Another of those daring robberies which have beeen so frecuently conimitted of late in various parts of tho West Ridiug of Yorkshire, but particularly in the neigPhbourhood of the large towns, was perpetrated on the premises of Mr. John Hasriwich,a farmer residing at a PlaCc called GUlft, a few miles from Blotherham, on Monday last. Mr. Hard.wick wamsabout to take an additional thrn in the immediate viciity of his own, and had provided himself with between 2001. and 300. for the payment of the valuation, which had just been made. Of this 371. in gold and some loose silver were.deposited in a box in Mr. Hardwick's bedroom, and two rolls of 5l. notes, 1001. in each roll, 'were secreted in a pair of old :boots, which were left promiscuously among other articles of wiering apparel in the bedroom. Orn Monday afternoon yr.kinrdwick and his wife went to Rotherhaia market, locking up the chamber where the money was, and also the honse, before leaving. Very shortly after their departure two men made theira e crane on the premises, and seizing a lad named Samue w, about 15 years of age, who was looking after the cows, presented a pistol to his head, and commanded bim to be silent. They then dragged him into the cowhouse, and, having tied him securely.to the "heck," put a large piece ef turnip into his mouth, and tied up his jaws,by wayof gagging him. They then closed the door of the place, and proceeded to the house. into which they effected an entrance by brealdng a square of glass in one of the lower windows. Theyappear to have gone direct to the room where the money was, and to have forced open the door by means of a fiie oker, coal-rake, or such other implement asthey found at an The boxc containing the money was forced ope with a carving knife, and the contents, consistng of 71. and a purse with-some silver in it, were abstracted. The 200'., concealed in the zair of old boots, was missed by ,he thieves. After ransaclng the bedroom theywent downstairs in search of more booty, but succeeded only in obtaining a silver watch from a delf-closet. They then docamped from the house by the back door, and got clear off with their plunder. A haylork, a mattock, and a halfcircular hedging-bill which had been taken from Mr. Bnrdwick's corn-loft, apparently for weapons of defence, in case of discovery, were found in the house. Soon after the retreat of the robbers bad bten effected a sister of Mrs. Bardwick called at the house to pay a visit, and the robbery was then discovered. A neigbbour was at once summoned to tho premises, and was exaaining them when Mr. ardewick returned. - He inmediately went in search of the boy Law, and found him in the position already described, but greatly exhausted, having Tremained bound and twgged for about three hours. He was speedily released, ut d not recover his conscioisness for some hours after. The lad says he can swear to the men who seized him, and has given a description of two persons who were seen by otbers near tho placoe hortly Wefore the robbery was comsnitted. The watch and the purso also can be identiied. MSr. Hardvick has frequently been robbed of poultry, and has once or twice shot and -wounded the marauders.

In consequence of the desire felt by the authorities .it the War-office that the whole of the troops attached to the provisioimtl battalion at Chathamis should be thoroughly acquainted with the use and practice of the Enfield rides previous to their embarcation for foreign service, Colonel Henry Jervis, the comnmandant at Chatham barracks, has been directed to furnish a number of troopsfrom the depots now at Chatham, who will proceed to the School of. Mu. ketry atflytho to-morrow, for the purpose of undergoing a course of instruction in ri'de practice, under Colonel C. c. Hay, permanent instructor at that station. The whole of those selected will, on rejoining their regiments, act as instructors to the rest of the corps.

TO TAE' ED1TOR 0F TZE TItEg. Sir,-On the 23d of October, 185, there appeared a Roval warrant, professedly issued for the purpDSe oE affording compensation to the near relatives of those who had fallen in battle. 1 beliei-e thousands in Great Britaie personally unconcerned rejoiced when they read that warrant, (and the article in l7e 'nws upon itl, at the thought that the country would not allow a bloody war to pass Juggernaut-like over the land, heedless of the desolation and msery which it left in its track; but that it was prepared to prevent those who were already suffering the agony of bereavement, from feeling the sting of increased poverty and privation. Has the administration of this warrant had this effect? Let the following statement reply The vidowevd mother of an officer, who had spent the whole of his small patrimony in the purchase- of hc comlnisiion, applied, under the warrant of the 23d of October, for the sum of 1,800K, which she had advanced to her son for the obtaining of his promotion, and upon which he had confidentlyhoped to be able to pay her interest. After serving throughout the whole Crimean campaign, distinguishing himself at the Alma and at Inkermann, after beinghonourably mentioned in one of Lord Raglan's despatches, and being decorated with a C.B., he fell mortally wounded in the attack on the Pedaa on the 8th of September. He belonged to that 2d Division of our amy which was thus mentioned in one of your leading articles on that very attack, "the assaulting column directed against the Iedan was selected from those two corps which have borne so very large a portion of the sufferings and losses of the campaign, and have covered the regiments belonging to them with incomparable distinction." The mother'sclaim to a return of the 1,8007. she haa advanced as refused by the Secretary of State for War on the ground that she possessed an income of 300l. per aunum. On receiving this refusal, she addressed a second petition to the War-office, praying lord Pamaure to reconsider her case, and eiplaining that her only surviving son IsMd been .ompelled from ill-health to relinquish his profession;,-ind that he wvas, with his wfife, mainly dependent upon her for spport. The reply to this second petition contained Lird Panmure's regret, that the reguatious.bv which he was governed in the administration of the warrant of -the 23d of October entirely precluded his entertaining it. Sir, who fr'amed these regulations? Wo hear much of the loss of prestige on the continent, 'which the maladministration of our military affairs has entailed upon our country. What would have been our loss of rea power san influence, ha our offlicers and soldiers not exhibited untiring zeal, selfdenial, energy, and courage? And if the whol nation owea debt of gratitude to -thosev who so patiently bore all the hardships 'and sufferings -which incapacity and ineffisiency entailed upon them,-and $to those who who uncomplainingly laid down their lives in their efforts to counteract the effects of want of ability at home and want of generalship abroad, is not the debt doubled in the case of those who have been prevented by the patriotism of oor army from incurring the disgrace -which their mismanagemuent might otherwise have brought upon them? Is it, then, for offlcial men to seek to nullify the generous intentions of Parliament by refusing to the far distant graves in the Crimes the boon which would so greatly have alleviated their anxious distress on account of* their beloved ones it home? Sir, your successful u and nceasiig eserEios to beefit our army in 1854 and 1835 5wRi form ae honrt'able and memorable epoch in tho history of journalism. Complete your work by seeldng to obtain justice for the survivors of those who were so much indebted to you. is it more than justice that a mother should obtaiIt the retura of 1,8001. spent in placing her son in a position so efficiently to serve his country? The words of the Royal warrant of 23a October, 1805, are "In the event of at oficer leiving at his death neither widow child, or children, then the money may be paid to bis-fatlner; or, if he leave no father, it maybe p~aid to his roother, for his or her 5ole and absolute benefit, provided that nleither be piecluded by wealthy circumstances." Lord Panmutre's decisior in the case I have zmentioned asserts that tbe possession of 30DI per annum econstitutes seach wvealthy circujastancea as to disqualify a widow, with ia invalid sone and his widte- ainlydependent upon her, fom receiving bacl the money she had advanced. Wil the country ratify this verdict? a lnm Sir, vour maost obedient s-rva, E. A VOICE FRO.I THE CEMTERY ON - CATHOAJPS.HIJ,

Of course there is but one reason for this step-the coalition which the oponents of the bil succeeded in orgauizingmws toofornnable to leave any hope of success, and Governmnent hs preferred a retreat to ar adverse vote. Though we hardlg expected such a result, we can scarcely pretend to any very violenb emotionsof surprise. The measure was too uncompromising, too simple, and withal too honest to be quite secure of a triumph in such ana'sembly as the House of Commons. L-ike every great reforming measure which has passed into legislation, it is reserve for a nobler fate thln to wi all at once the tnanimous applause of such judges. Such measures are far more comprehensive than they seem. They embody the idea of jusice in opposition to vested rights; ,the welfare of the public in opposition to the interested pre. po-sessions of prescriptive prvilege. Hence they are so many battlefieds onwhich the eternal contest between the past and the present is waged* somany crazy ramparts behind which the retreating hordes of corruption rally. ThLe Mouse of Commons is, after all, an odd assemblage of legislators. Onehalf of the hon. gentlemenwho take their seats ard v.hollyt f ree from the absurd idea of regulating the 1kgislationL of the country by the broad and simple principles of equity. They go there anned with invuluerable erotchets; glOwing with magnanimous ardour on behalf of the ancient order of things; inwmnrdl frette at the past tiumpisof liberality; and determmned, if they cannot get back al they hare lost, at least to lose nothing that they can manage to retain. Lynx-eyed Toryismu discerns ir erery surviving corruption a mirror of its own wrinkled form, and is moved to its inmost bowels of compassion on its behalf EBvery person wrho snspect; that his principles a-nd interests are not quite in harmny wth the new and inevitable order of thmngs at once takQea up the war-cry, and makes the cause his Own. .Fction, also, is never backward at playing its part.

SAMETY 03!4 Pf. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-When the risk to which the gublic are exposed from fire and, robbery in solicitors? an =erhanta' offices in London (few of whom have a safety room) is considered I am surprised that a fireproof establishment for the care aid safe custody of deeds, plate, and other valuables does not yet take its place among the numerous public institu tions that have started into life since the passing of the Limited Liability Act. Asapractising, solicitor I c n bear testionony to the value and convenience of a private safety room for te custody of eseds, and 1 am sure that among the profession generalty a wel-regulated and highly patronized instituption of the 7nind in London woud be hailed as, great boon ana public coraenience. Knowiag, as Ido, thiat noinstittttion is likeLty t;obe Sulpported upon publicgrounds only,without at the same time affording a profitable investment, I sin quite prepared to show in detail that such an establihment as that to which I allude woufld, unlder propw anDa discreetrmnaement, p3y an ample dividend to the aharebolaers. The main features of my plan would be to erect two or three fire-proof buildings in so many localities in London, most convenient to professional gentlemen and others who may avail themselves of their advantages, and, to have in each buildintg separate strong-rooms or cells for any person -wishing to Tive the exclusive se of one, and also other piaces for depositin= deed4 securities, plate, &c., on the responsibility and unader the guardianship of the magers; and in each building private rooms for the examination of deeds by solicitor at their own option and convenience. - The-vantages of such an -establishment as a protection from fire and from the plunder of servants and others would, I am confident, command that which would be ro mccessary to its success-the highest patronage and very general support. - I hope some of your numerous readers may profit by these hints, and carry out what I have thus roughly sketched. h I have the honour to be,Sir, your obedient servant. - A SOIaCITOR.- meD. m.

Tir 1Nsw PoucE BuaL.-In the lNorwich towncouncil on Tuesday, Sir S. Bignold, 3LP., expressed himself generally in favour of this nWasure, and characterized the opposition which had been raised against it as a violent and Mnnecesary hue and r. Mr. Tillett protested against the bill as a measure cal=ted to estabibh a kind of gend.rmericin England, andcto subvert local self-govermnent and pop,ular liberty. Mr. Browne urged that such fears were quite idle with a reformed Parliament and a free psress; but after an animated discussion the council decided to petition against the bill by 28 votes to 8. Ia the course of thepro. ceedings some smart obcervations were made at the expense of the latedepuations of municipal functionaries to Sir G. Grey.

BOIlS' COURT. C wN-CERY-LA-. F27. XAY V- SnMIT -- (Bcfore the MAsTE1 of the RoDLI -) The object of this suit, which may be described as a continuation of "Ray v. Johnston." reported a few days since, was to set aside a bond for 1%5001. dated the 12th of April, 1854. It will be remembered that the plaintiff, who came of age the day before the bond was dated, was a gentleman entitled to a sum of money in the funds amounting to about 120,000L, and considerable landed property, and thathe had been concerned with a Mr. Johnston, during his minority, in drawing and- accepting bils to a considerable amount. Just before the p]aintiff attained his majority he was advised by Johnston to get some one to take up these bills, and, on the day after he came of age, ws persuaded to sign' the bond in question, as security, it was -eiow contended, for bills of exchange which a Mr. Georie Smith, an attorney, had cashed, but which the plaintiffcould not be sued on, on account of his having signed them during his rminority. Plaintiff now urged that the bond he had given to Smith, whom-he had never seen until the day on which he executed the bond, ought to be declared null and void. inasmuch as; any money Smith might have advanced had been paid to Johnston and not to plaintif and that the consideration for the bond was altogether visionary. In answer to this, the defendant Smith does not attempt to contend that the bond ought to be supported in.its character as a legal deed, t hat it ought to held so far valid and operative as to bind the plaintifE to pay to the defendant aU sums which the defendant could show he had advanced on the credit of the plaintiff's name. The case was not concluded when the C6urt rose. Mr. B. Palmer, 3fr. Cairns, and Mr. Dicldnson appeared for the plaintiff; the Solicitor-General and M. Speed for the defendant.
VICE-CHATCELIOR'S COIJT. 27 FARDU V. SItVTRTOC1 (Beforc Vicec-CancelorSir W. P. W6oD.) This case, which has been already fully reported in 27e Times, uponthe motionfor an injunction last ear, nowcame on for heaiinn, the plaintiffat this stage of thc proceedings seelingto mnake the iunction previously obtained perpetual, and that the defendant might be decreed to deliver up to the plaintiff all such labels and paners, and all castings, inpressions, and stereotype plates, with the signature, sddress, flourish, seal, pr stamp, and other marks, or merely colourably differing therefrom, now in his possession. It wM be suffident, on the present occasion, to state that the bie w ilhed dby Johann MaTia Faiina, of Cologne, to restrain the defendant, who is: a printer of labels-, from printing or selling, or exposing for sale, or procur to be peintedand sold, anZ labels slinilar to those in use by the plaintbff, upon wIln 7was engraved " Johann Maria Farina andalso a seal orrsalup h c-hn icllor had grane an injunction on the 6ith of June last, upon the plaintiff's Upon the opening of the case by Mr. DAN, and Mr. HMERS-GsTox, on behalf of the plaintiff The - VIcE-CfEsemmrzson cUale -upon' te 'def endant's counsde to state their grounds of opposition to the decree isked for. - Ir. WrucOCiK and MVr. BUXvo, for the defendant, contended that the trade mark of the plaintiff, uponi the evidence which had been adduced since the motion for an injunction, was shown to be nothing more thanan alteration of a current mark which had been generally and unrestrainedly used, and had been sold by the defendant in the course of his trade before the plaintiff had acquired a right to, or even invented, what he now called his trade mark. The defendant stateda pon oath that the !abels complained of were not fraudulent imitations, and that he 'did not use any label known or suspected to have been the plaintiff's Aradenmark in their fabrication. The plainiff had established an agent in this country for 15 years, who was aware of the continual sale of spurious eau de Cologne, and the length of time which had been sufferedAto elape furnisheda necessary inference that the plaintiff had abandonred any-assertion of his rights. The VscE-CH;cx-aLOn observed that it was much to be regretted that m;ore than two hours should have been occupied with this case, which might have been disposed of once for all upon the motion for injunction. He had considered upon that occasion that th e pWntiff cnd full established his right to the thade marki He had nfl doubt upon that, either then or now, for not a word of additional evidence had been adduced which could shake that conclusion. Th laintiff had established his distinct right in Germany, whic right had been affirmed on appeal, reasserted, and reconfirmed in that country. 'Then, as to England, ther was evidence of his having successfauly asserted his right to the trade marL in si cases. The affidavit of Mr. Gosnel, the perfumer, which had been adduced on behalf of the defendant, merelv amounted to this-that some years ago he had shown to the plaintiff's agent a label which might or might not have been construed by a Court as an invasion of the trade mark, that label1 being not "gegeafiiTh," &c., hut " a2* -isi mac14s c, which was quite a sufficient variation to render success n a suit bythe plaintiff doubtful. His Honour, after commenting upon the affidavits filed by the defendant, who ad his1{onur bseved)givn avery lamne explanation oa thes modeby whiech theselabels had come into his possession, said that, if he we.e now to disis; the bill the dseftenda would bt entitlevdAto tdocthat whicl; in effect, he assetedhis igh todo-viz., to contiu tomanufacture andsl theelabl indiscriminately to retail dealers, leaving theplfaintiff to sue the parties sellingyau de Cologne 'with these lbels if he could discover them. 7t had appeared to him on a former occasion that a court of e-usty was justified in stopping the mischief at the fountain head, and, under these circuLstances, he should make the injunction agamist the defendant perpetual, and direct bim to deliver upon oath all labels and papers, &c. (following the words in the prayer of the bill givenL above). The defendant must pay the costs of the suit.

&PMHG ASTZES. NORTHFRN IIMnf C.AA2.T.TQT.R. R91:n CROWN~ COanRT-(Befori Mfr. Bdr-on Misrri.) *Jane Nattrass, a faxm servant, -aged 29, was-ihdicted-for the mansla ughter, and, on the coroner's inquisition, with the wifl tdanurder of her newly-bomra ale ichild at lanercost, on the 26th of Audgut last. Mir. Monk and Mr. &l'Otubreyproscunted,and Mr. Campbell Foster defended the prisoner. -- 'It appeared from the evidence of a witness named ElizAbeth Hind that she and the prisoner lived neighb;onrs under one roof, at the vilage of Lanercost, in this county, and that they were in the habit of going out together to workc in huLsbandry. TLhe prisoner's father and a little boy lived lin the hous -with her, hut the father -was frequently from home. The witness and' her husband and thiree children, the eldest' of- whom was sevet years of age, lived in the adjoining house. On the 26th of -August last Elizabeth Hinid knock-ed at the prisonee's door in the morning, as she was going to work, to ask if slhe would go with her. The prisoner said she was poorly, and tould not gebp ut that she perhaps might be able to gotoworkincheaterooon. At diiiner time llliza both Rind..again knocked at the door of th6 prisoner's house. She was alone with her little boy, fomr years old, luerfatherbeing from home. Hindaakedhbowshewas~,and she still complained that she could not get urthat s'he wvas sick Mrs Hid offered to do anything for- erj but she declined assistance. Mrs Hlind again went to work-, and did not return till 9 o'clock at nighit5 when he-was imet.b her own children, who toldl her that, Jane (the prisoner) was d_igtatseha-en screaming out. 'She immediately wetto the prisoner's door, which Atil emnai!ued icked, and asked her how she felt. She replied-that she was very poorly. Mrs Hlind atnd othe ne-ghbour w'omaen thenwent to the window..ana asked if they should get anything for her or for her little boy, butshe still declined,'and sad they had enough in the house till morning. Halfan hour afterwards the prisoner opened the door and called M1rs. Hind, who, on entering her roomi, found the fire lighted and the prisoner tested, uandressed, at the edge of the bed. Seeing markEs on the floor, Mrs. Hlind asked what was amniss when thrisoner sid it was all over and she must naetebs oDf i. Mrs. Hind then saw a; petticoat under the bedclothes stained with blood, and on looking att it found a newly-born child, still warm, folded in the petticoat and under the bed-clothes. On questioning the prisoner about it yh risoner said the chil a been born about 5 o'clock, that she had tried to rise and dress ilt but fainted. She had tried to give it some nourishment; hut had fainLted and could not, that the child haLd cried, and she thought she-had heard it"1 rattle" a short time before. The petticoat in which it was folded had been placed under her, and she ha folded it over the -child, as she could. not raise it. This evidence was 'confinned by other wvitnesses, neighbour womnen who wrent into the prisoner's house. She had never said she Was in thefanywy and, excepti the- clothes wihich she Wia for hemr1w-lat hid,hd provided no clothes for her baby. She also said that the child w-as born before its timne. M1r. Graham, a 'surgeon in the neighbourhood, who had examined the child and maade a post mortem examination of it stated that he found no external maarks of Violence upon it whatever, and that in his judgment the child bad died of sufHocation, which might have been caused by the wet petticoat folded over it. On cross-examinnation he stated that the child milght have been suffocated by lying siniply on its face. A woman mig'ht besodebffhtaw bya severe labour as to be wholly unable of herself to assist her child. Such a labour would also debilitate the child, and render it less able to mnale any instinctive attempts to breathe and save itself from suffocation from any covering pressing on its. mouth. Very little would suffocate a child under such circumstauces. For the defence it was urged that the pris-on'er, supposing her statement to be true,-and there was no other ev.idence as to her condition after the birth of the child until Mrs. Hind's arrival, at half-past 9 o'clock,-had done all in 'her power to preserve the life of the child.- She was alone and wtotassistance, and her screams, heardl by,the children, had testified to the suffering she had endured.

The Lord mayor presided, his Lordship being supported by Sheriffs Rose and Kennedy, and a large gathering of the prindpal members of the -wholesale and retai house lu proposing the toast of the night, the Lord Mayor dwelt on a report of pecuniary relef afforded in 1855 to 100 recipients of the bounty of e institution, and the fact ef about 40) havnng had their mneans of subsistence increased, if not entirely p rovidedy its funds.

IBBLAND. f(rox ovi OWN CoRlqw4Pownvvr A DUBLIN, WxDEOMDAY MORzfl(0. TIIE SVYWtDW OF Mi. JOUN SADLRU. Until t'ne hearing of the winding-up petition protented to the Court of Chancery last week, it in not expected. that anything perfectly reliable will traispire witli respect to the als'airs of the Tipperary B-ak, or to the extent of ita difficulties-the result of its utnfortunate connexion with ther man wlhose gigantic frauds have cast into the shade the memory. of the maost nccomplished swindUer of ancient or miodern times. " What next-aid next T" are tlle qipestions in every one's mouth, and full and conlplete answers cannot be long delayed,, so that in the, meantime it 'would be umnecessary to refer -to the alhmost countless reports that are in circulation As to transactions which have not teem yet whollo< brought to light. Lc-g before 3Mr. Swdleir lett is native country for Englanid, a a more enlarged spliere for his peculiar operations, his professional reputation was none of the highest; but people here, even those'who best knew the man, were not prepared for the astounding revelations elucidated since the -commission of the act which closed his misspent life. A cosnnty journal (the Tipp-arjy Vittdicator), received this morning, gives the subjoined statement in reference to the afiairs of the bank aiid its branches in the 'south " The banks in each of the toevns wlhere they wvere ostabulilsed continue open. The managers answer those who call en beanems. No payments are mlade. In Nenagh and l;eserea deppsits were very considerable-in Nenagh, we have herd, tetsween 20,001. and 30,000M, of which a sumn it is said of 8,W00. was paid ont during the first stages of the ru Thhe Nenagh Unlio, as iwell as the County Treaslurer-tle latter for thc Northi Riding-kept their accounts with the estab'slishment. A sum of over 1,2001. balance remains to the credit of the Nenagih Union, for which there are securities-Mr. Sadleir, of Scalahecn, and Mr. Sinon Arstrg of Tipperary; their hond is for 6,0001. to the guardians. At the List meeting of the board of guardians a resolution as unanimously adopte4 to sac those sentletnen for the amount due by tho bank to the union, and Mr. O'Bren DiUon received instructions to that cefw,t. In loncrea it is believed that the anount of deposits was muuchl larger than in Nenagh. There was no other bank in Roscres, And the business transacted there is s.aid to have been large, and the deposits to have betn very numervus. In Thurles the union kept its account witl the branch in that town. The balance on thc stoppsge etpjaysssnt waS a fewr shillings over 461i. In Tipperary town the deposits are allegedI to have been very gret, stnd in (-.rlowv, wre h.avo heard, they were very gre.at also. WNe have not heard that the deposits in Carnek-on-Snir were very l.rge. Vasrious rumoulrsare current as to the 1iabilities of the late Mr. John Sadleir to the establishment; but as it is impossible to give currency to rmours which a few daLys will either verify or contradict, we abstain from referring to them. A treniendous feeling of exciteinent prevailed for some days in every part of Tipperary, and the rlsh on all the banks for goldawas nuprecedentel. The small fanning class, holding notes, nmde no distinction.and sueh of theii as had deposits in otherbanks, and notes, clainied eltl, with which they were supplied in ani instant. An immense pile of buillion met the eye of every individual who presented a note for payment in the Nenagh National Bank, where Mr. Devitt, thei manager, and Iiis assistants met the claims of the people with a cheerful alacrity, and showed how foolish was the run on that establishnient. In Thurles 3tr. Cuimmins, the manager, and his assistants were equally artive: and in Tip,perary and elsewhere, wherever the run prevailed on the 's ational Bank, the samue exjedition in mectinu the deisands of those wo ran for gold was observable. AV e have heard that the managers paiI gold for al notes presented, wvhether their own or of any other branch, and in senIC cases notes af the Bank- of Ireland, for which the eoor holders claimed gold in a few instances." A Kilkenny journal (thie Mfo?erafor) states that the effect of the sudden stoppage of the one branch of the bank in that county has not been so extensively felt there as in other localities; still, should there not be sufficient assets fortheoming to meet all deenands, there will be many victims uon the Thomastown distriet; and for instance,- II The Board of Guardians of the Thomastown Union, having kept their account at the Thomastown Bank, in such an event will lose a sum of 1,600M.-a most important consideration to the ratepayers, who would have to be taxed over again to supply the deficicicy. One of the county cess collectors also, Mr. Burton, we understand, had lodged some hindreds of pounds of the public money at Thoimastown. The ProNincial Bank an this city is fixed upon by the grand jury for the keeping of their treasurer's account, bFiut 'Mr. Burfon, for the sake of the convenience which its proximity to his residence afforded. used to lodge sums according as he collected theus at thc Thomastown Bank, til lie bad accumulated a large amount, which lie then usually transferred to the Provincial. It will be a very hard case indeed if this deserving public official should lose the suni which ho had taken such pains to secure for the coQntV. We are informed that the R1ev. 11r. Kealcey, P.P., Thomastown, was likewise a considerable depositor of what may be termed public money-a fund collected for the purpose of building a chapcl. Alargenunsherof deposits ofasimilarkiandarejeopardiced in the branches of the hank in Tipperary, Carrick-onSair, and Thurles, nhere the - were lodged by the Roman Catholic clergymen bywhomtheyhadbeen collected. Among the privato dopositors atthc Thomastownbranch bank there atre many hard cases, and some narrow eecapes. In the latter category may becited the cascof asentleman, . extensive laud agent, tho drew a s em -ofrly amounting to 2,000L onfly a few- ys before the crash, and the enount to whose credit on the books on that occasion was only li. or 6t. A gentleman residing near Thomastown had for a considerable time deposited SM., and was about to Iraw it when the first intiunation was received taat draughts had been dishonoured in London; but having been informed at the bank that if he drew without giving the requisite notice of a few days he would not be entitled to interest, he very imprudently gave the prescribed notice, and let the muoney remain c tlculating that, as the draughts had been subsequently honoured in London, a 'break up' might be deemed as certain to be staved off for sometime at least. A struggling farmer, residinu near Annainult, who had been Iccepingup his corn for higher prices, recently sent all his grain tbo bCsold at the mills at Thomastown, as there seemed to be no further hope of an advance in the markets ovwng to the san,guine expectations of peacc. His son received 1001. forthe corn, and, not liking to return home in the evening with sudc a sun upon his person, he went to the bank and got a letter of credit for it, payable at the Bunk of Ireland-office, in Kilkcnny. On returning home he put the document in his box, intending to cash it on the nsext occasion of his going into the city, but in a week or two the tidings of Mr. Sadtfleis suicidce reached hini, and brought with it tho sad reflection that his neglig^nce in keeping over the letter of credit so long had brought ruin upon B ian . It is shted that a bumble publiran in Thonastown was a depositor to the amount of about 5001., Sthe savings of his wvhole llfe. Many similar cases mzight be recounted.: The money due on deposits of various cl.asses in the Thoinastowvn branch of the Tipperary Joint Stock Bank is said to amount to 50,0001. There has been a kind of petty run ont th three bank-offices in our city-the Provincia-l, Bank of Ireland, and Nationalsince the Sadleir catastrophe became kno The more ignorant portion of the country people who had small sums deposited. or who held notes of any kind, at once took the .alantn, and commenced looking for geld inimediately. I' is unnecessary to say that this trifling panic, altegether confined to a very few of ithe lower order of people, caused no inconvenience to any of the establishments here, and it hass nowv almost ceaosed." The WYateiforsd Mail of yesterday contains the annexed particulars.- "We are not surprised at the intelligence rhich we published this day of the for=enes of the late Mr. John S;dle luit we are sprised at their amount. It was evident that a man of his ability and position would not have put an end tohieistence merelyfrom lessof property. We greatly fear that the sectrities in the London and Countyas wel as in the Tipperary Joint-stock Banks, for advances made to him, will prove valneless. While we have no wish to prove alarmists, re regard the position of the shareholders and depositors in the latter bank with rnuch concern. Its finances must have run very low when it was compelled to stop payment, because, as it lwas not a bank of isue, it would necessary rediscount its good paper, and the orly assets likely to remain in its hands would be paper which the Bank of Ireland would refuse. In consequence of the Tipperary Joint-Stock Bank allowing one er cent. lnore interest on deposits than the other banks, irgc sums were lodged by farners and others, and in some instances public funds, such as grand juy css and Poor Lat union funds, were also deposited in it, and mercantile men having accounts there are serionsly inconvenienced by the stoppage. The object of tlhe directors is to avoid a fat of bankruptcy, which would involve legal expenses to an enormous extent, and which, in consequence of the petition to plce it tinder the Winding-up Act having been allowed by tle Lord Chancellor, will now be avoided. Three of'the directors ia the London and Corunty Bank appear on the list of shareholdlers in tho T Pprsara- Joint-Stock Bank. T7hey are-the late John Sadeir, LP., Robert Keatmg, M.P., Farr,nry John Law, banker, London; but t}:e London bamners of the Tipperary Joint-Stock Bankwere Messis. Glyn, Halifar , and Co, and net the london and CountyBank. We regret to find so asany of the shareholders desarbed as widovws and spinsters These ladies have, we fear, invested all their property in such sh1ares and they will_notb e able to book up to meet re clams or depositoas. we are told, wve knowsinot with wihat degree of truth, that a 13rge amount of funds belonging to Romtan Catholic charities and religious houses in EngLand was deposited w;ith Mtr. Sadleir, and fear.s a:e en-tertalurd thuat it is all lest." All these anisfortunes are of coiurse but the' :b%gning of the end, and no one ean f oretell what, fitliher revelations time may bring -forth. The XBsiuler of VisfCr a ournal not politically opposed to the *-retched au.thor of this fearful amnoint of: ;misery, thus comments upon his career and death :- "TIhe suicide of John SaAeif, 3LP., produced a sesshtion whiek,, so far from subi3ding, has been greatly in=rwed 'by subsequent disclonsres of an astouncding 4escrapti n.

ST. PANCILS WoRsunoUs.-The committee appointed by the board of directors of the poor of St. Pancras, at the meetig on Tuesday, to take into consideration the report of Dr. Belce Jones, on the present state of the workhoUse, reported in 27.e 2tTim, of yesterday, have met. The coinmuttee consists of Messrs. Streeten, Cooper, Dyke, Baker, Carter, and the churchwardens. 'After maturely considering the report from the Poor Law Board, as well as that brought up by the vestry, the commiittee unanimously resolved upon a report, recommending the vestry forthwith to remove the schools from the workhouse, and to hire some conunodious buildin" for the purpose until such timneaspermanent schools could be proeided. The report likewise reconimends the removal of the relieving offices from the workhouse t,o the rooms lately occupied by the Cornmissioners of the Southampton Paving Board,'Edward-street, Hanpstead-road. These and other suggestions contained in the report will be presented to the vestry st its meeting this day. A Fxw Qusroxs REQVIRING Asswmt.-When a reviewer or other writer has crammed himself to choking with some particularly abstruse p ieee f information, why does he introduce it with the casual remark that "every schoolboy knows" it? He didn't know it himself last week. Why is it indispensable that he should let off this introductory cracker among his readers? We have a vast number of extraordinary fictions in common use, but this fiction of the schoolboy is the most unaecountable to sne of all. It supposes the schoolboy to know everything. The schoolboy knows the exact distance, to an inch, from the moon to Uranus. The schoolboy knows every conceiv-able quotation from the Greek and Latin authors. The schoolboy is up at present, and has been these two years, in the remotest cormers of the maps of Russia and Tarkey, previously to which display of his geographical accomplishments he had been on the most intimate terms vith the whole of the gold regions of Australia. If there were a ran against the monetary system of the country to-morrow, we should find this prodigy of a schoolboy down noon us w,ith the deepest mysteries of banking and the etrrency. We have nearly got rid of the ishman who stood by us so long, and did so much public service, by enabling the narrators of facetious arnecdotes to introduee them with " As the Irishman said." We have quite got rid of the Frenchman who was for many years in partnership with him. Arewe never on any terms to -et rid of the schoolboy ? If the Court Circular be a sacred institution for the edification of a free people, why is thc most abhorred villain always in'ested, in right oftbst frightful distinction, with a Court Circularof his own? Why ain I always to be told about the ru fian's pleasa,nt manners, his easy ways, his agreeable snile, his affable talk, the profound conviction of his innocence that lie blandly wafts into the soft bosoms of guileless lambs of turkeys, the orthodox air with which he comes and goes with his Bible and Prayer-book in his hand, along the yard, that I fervently hope mnay have no outlet for b but the gallows? Why am I to be dosed and drenched with these nauseons particulars, in the case of every wretch sufilciently atrocious to become their subject ? Why am I supposcd never to know all aboat it beforehand, and never to have been pelted with similar aud in my life ? Ras not the whole detestable programme been presented to me without variation 50 times ? Am I not failir With every line of it, from its not being generally known that Sharmer was much respected in the county of Blankshire down to the virtuous heat of Bilkins, Shaor mers counsel,- when, in his eloquent address, he cautions the jurmnen abont laying their heads o0 their pillows, and is mnoved to pious wrath by the wicked predisposition of human nature to object to the foulest maurder that its faculties can imagine ? Why, why, why, must I have the lXewgate Court Circular over and over as if the genuine Court Circular 'were not enoughto nas kc me modestly independent,prud, grateful, and happy? When I overhcar my friend BSak -dash inquire of my fricnd Asterisk whether- he knows Sir Giles Scroggias, why does Asterisk replayprovisionallyand with-limitation,"that he hasmethim?

BAILWAY INTELLIGENCE. %tT.-mnPNv.TA The .alf-yearly meeting of this company was held yestery at the offices, Great George-street, Mr. Xains'in the The report stated that the directors hoped that the time was now not'far distant, should the anticipations of a speody. termination of tle war be happily realized, when they might safely give the order to begin this undertaking, tle valueandimportancoof whichwere universally admittedL In the mcantime application would he made to Parliament to extendl the tinic fr lhe constrtuction of that' portion of the lino first authorized, and to release the large sum of moncy at preseiit lying idlle in the hands of the AccountantGeneral, vhich, if applicable fot the purposes of the mndertaking, would enable the dircttrs to conplete a consideeabl& EectiOn of the line before mnalinir further calls. Th capital accountshowved thalt122,'J9. had been received and 36.0!. expended, Icaving a balance of 71,250.:in thes hands of thc Accountanst-General and 14,088 at thle bankers... The CIstAslAir, in moving tho adoptioni of the report, said that the condition of the moncy-marlket had Secn sctch that it would have been unwise to attempt to prosmecuto tho works; they lhad therefore simply expended 369' lor the half-year, for office expenses and clerIcs, and even tl5 amount was in course of reduction. If peace should be estabiished and the money-market becomc easici tho works woivld be proceeded with, but at presenttatll tey coutd do was to -remain quiet and waxit for better times. Tle board thought it would Ie better not to proceed to the election of diieetors and that the meeting should be adjonrned for two mo'hths. .They wereaware that he had-taken aprouinent past in the Association for Promo'tinz Rilway Reform, and if it were thnught his cosnexion 'witht that movement was likedvto ho- injuriouls to the interests of that company, he -sholuod s'ot hesitate to retire, not only from the chair, hut from the direction. h The motion having been seconded, A long-discussion ensued, in the courso of whiclh it was stated by soene of the shareholders that there were rnmourg to the effect that there never had been any serious intention of constructing the line. By others it was urged thtt. calls ought at once to ho made, that property required for the use oFtthc line could-be purchased at a much less rate now than in the time of Peace, and that if energy mere di. layed there could be no doubt, by siaking judicious calIs sufmicient moneywouldbeforttlconling to prosecute the works. It appeared to be the opinion of the ueeting that tho line, if made, oil pay a good dividend. In reply to seone ohscryLtiensit was stated tbat the Greatc Wfestern Company woul , by means of the MIetropolitan line, and a proposeid extension to the docks, halve a much ne,.ecr route to the River Thames thatn that enjoyed by the Lonion anld .North-WVestern Conmpansy; that it vas tlseparamomlt interest ofthe Great Western Company-to secure such a communication, and that that company wan most anxious to render the Metropolitan line every asist nce in their power. Ultimately it was resolved not to receive the report, but to adjourn the meeting for a couple of mouths. NORTH-WESTERN. The half-yearly mneting of this company was held at Leeds yesterday, Mrr. Henry Alcock in the chair. The report u-as read by the secretary and stated that,- " The receipts for the half-year enlding the 31st of Decom1er, 1855, amount to 27,355!., and tho working and otlher expenses for the saume period to 14,1731., leaving a balance of 13,1817., and, after payment of the interest on debentuut debt and preference share capital, there remains a sum of 4,440!. available for dividend?' The directors recommended a diidend of 2s. 3d. per sbare, and stated that there had been a slight decre.ase of traffic during tlhe half-year, but that new sources of income had be4isscured bymieans of the facilities afforded at Iforecombe-bay. Theylhadbeenanxions, theystated, toreduce the annual cbarges for managenment, but believed that at present it wvould be undesirable to make any change. The report concluded by stating that, in consequenec of thc " octuple treaty," the directors badeletrmined to go to Parliament for farther powers, including power to ruttn over the Midland Railway between Leeds and Skiptin, over the Lancaster and Carhisle Railway between the intdnded junction near Tebay and Carlisle, and over the Caledonian Railway, betwveen Carlisle and the GLasusv and South-Western Junntion, near Gretna. The CAMirMScZ, in moving the adoption of the report, congratulated the shareholdeirs that tlhe decrease in the traffic during the last half-year (about 500.) had not under the circumstances been greater, and stated that there had been an increase during the lst tlrec weeks, as compared with the corresponding weeks of 1855, of nearly 2001. -The adoption of the report was seconded by Mrr. nifrr, and the motion was carried. After some remarks from Dr. CowAx, condemnatory of the octuple treaty, and of alliances of that nature, which he said were merely alliances of great companies to despoil the smaller ones, A dividend of 2s. 3d. per share was agreed to, and ordered to be paid forthwith, and Mr. Hare, Mr. J. Burkill, and MIr. T. Horsfall, retiring directors, and Ur. Frost, auditor, were re-clected. A vote of thanks was given to the chairman and the directors, and the meeting terminated. NORTH DEVON. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday at jthe London T.averni M1r. W. Tite, M1.PR, in tho _hair. Mr. Harris, the secretary, read the report, which stated that the traffic had shown an increase during the past halfyear, as compared with the corresponding period of the year 1854, equal to an average wee ly increase of C1L., or 3,1721. yearly, and the directors anticipate a continlihi and gradual progress. -After providing for tho debenture and loan interest, ard the paysment-of offlce and other eexpenses of the past hal.yea, -the revenue acrount shows a balance of 2,0531. available for dividend; and the directors recommnend that a dividend, at tse rate of ll. los. per cent. peer annum, be declared On the stock of t&c company thc past half-ve ar, leaving a balance of ;0G. T0 capital entitled to dividend amnounts to 291,628., and the amount paid on forfeited shares not liable to divdend to 33,30!., together 324,968! The directors recommend the forfeiture of 33G shares, the amount received on which is included in the above. The directors have found it necessary to allot a portion of the forfeited and unissuedshares of the company as a 6per cent, preference stock for the purpose of mxeting the balance due to the contractors for additional works at stations, and a portion of the debenture debt required to be paid off during the current half-year. The directors were in hopes of placing those preference shares at 6 percent. per annum, redeemable at the expiration of five years on the payment of a bonus of opercent.,andtheytherefore madearrangementsby whichthey were allotted pro rat-d accordingly. But so large a number feU to ths lot of parties either incapacitated by their corporate constitution or other causes from accepting them that the directors have found it necessary to increase the bonus to 101. per cent., and have re-allotted the shares on the same terms,-and they now entertain no doubt that by this concession the amount required wiU be raised. The amount to be raised by this issue of preference stock is to the e.xtent of 30,000!., of which smm about 20,000!. is to rep y existing temporary loans now standing at 6 per cent.; the future additional charge therefore against revenue is only to the extent of 6 per cent. on 10,0001., or 600!. per annum, and ilstill leave a net balance of about 4,70. per annum on the year's revenue available for dividend on the ord:nary stock, after the payment of all interest on debenture bonds and temnporary loans. The capital account shows that 469,768!. had been received, and 455,145!. expended, leaving a balance of 14,6234 The revenue account showed 6,000!. had been received from Mr. Brassey for the half-year's rent of the line, to which 'Was added 2091. from the last accouint, making 6,2001.; the interest on loans amounted to 3,344!., and salar.es and office eanernses to2061., leavimg 2,657!. available for dividend. 'Te CELsUnaR=, in moving the adoption of the report, raid the line wIas leased to lMr. Brassey for 12,0001. a-year, and he was happy to saythat ther canital account was nearly closed. They had had some difficulty in raising money on debentures, and he hoped the shareholders would take up the remainder of the 6 percent. preference shares to meet the liabilities of the company. It was proposed to redeem them at the end of five years on paymnent of a premnium of 10 per cent., which would be ceqivalent to S per cent. for the whole time. The traffic had increased considerably since the opening of the Bideford line in November last. The traffic had increased by 83!. per week since the commencement of the year, as compared with the correspondig period last year. The branecE to Bideford had proved a ceeder to the main line. Mr. UZIELU seconded the motion for the adoption of the report, which was carried unanimously. Resolitious were passed confirming the forfeiture of 238 No. 1 shares, and 4 2ro. 2 shares; declaring a dividend at the rate 1. 15s. per cent. per annum on the ordinary shares, and of 3410. per cent, per annumn on the B. shares; reelecting Messrs. J. SharlaKnd, E. Woolmer, and J. G. lrith, the retiring directors; and electing r. G. Braginton a director of the company. The retiring aulditor was then re-elected, and the proceedings conhluded w ith a vote of thanks to the chairman and directors. SOUI'H DEVON. The half-yearly meeting of this companywasheldat Plymouth on Tuoslay, Mr. Woollrombe in the chair. The report stated that the disposable balance amounted to 16-09U1., of which the dividend on the half shares and the n3ew shares would absorb 7,320., and a dividend of 6s. E6L per 50l. share would absorb 6,484., leaving a balance of 1,2861. Thetrafficreceiptsfor the half-year amounted to 66,188S., aginst 62,973!. at the corresponding period of the preceding year. The disposable balance was more than-sulfOrient to pay a dividend of 7s. 6d. pr 50!. share. Theoxepeeditre on maintenance of -worl3 had beeh unnmally nev,aiigfrom causes which it wvas hoped may he re-. garded as exeeptionaL The CHrArsu-rA, in moving the adoption of the report, said that 12 imonths ago they had a sernous disaster on the line in the neighbourhood of Teiguamouth. - They were enabled at the time to appropriate a certain amount of moneyv towards paying for that accident out- of the halfyear, anid they had now finallydischarged the expenucs of repairing te disaster. But thi had caused the maintenance to be considerably in e-cess of that which it might he expected to he in ordinary half-years, and -it made juit the difference in the dividend which they recommiended to he declared anid that which thie directors meominend.-d the shareholders to decLare for the corresponding period of the last year. He then went through various items in the accounts~, showing that they were deficient- of working stock-, and would - have soon to provide for hiring it fromiother companies, or for raising money to purchase the additional stDel required for the increasig traflces He bad no doubt himself, and had always been 'of opinion,. that teoeigof the Cornwall line %wa the only thing whih th proprietors of the . Sou'th Devon Railway; mnust look forward - to as likely tomk very mt-. He ahLo looked forward -to a considerable increase to tboe trtade traffioof the company, and, be hopod,'to the prosperity of the -neighbourhood generally,' in' eonequenco of the completion of the Great Western Doeks,'which lie believed might- now he6 onsidered as rapidly approaching. The South povon aid the Bristol' and Exeter Comnpanies together had tgeen obliged to come' forward for the.pn.rpose ~ofassisting: the Doeck Company to complete these ivorks whicli both believed to he very essential to the interests of.associated railway companies.- The--direotors believed that anless tho sharelholders were wvilling to find the capital neces,ary to put the concern into A thororghly efficient state they could'not ,exiect to adrnco in prospenity. Eo .Ar as all the reqmremzents of capital -went to which lio could - at present look'forward, ho was very much disposed to think that that capital inihrhIs be raised -without-b ading materially to tho perni.ment eharges of the company. The mosti material ground on which additional capital would bo required was, to have possessioh of the locomotivo plant. At the presert time they werdworkin the lino under a contract with gnUtlemen who supplied the engines, and 'who charged at a certain mileage rate. In addition to the principlo on wvhiclitheir payments were made, they paidtho contractors 6 percent. oi tlso ainount of eapi til' invested; therefore it.was clearthat if the company raised a sufflcientamnount to 'buy ioff tlie' locomotive contract on the terms they were entitled to at a lower rate than 6 perctent., the differezice would be clear jirofit to tieo company. They would require further capital for carriages, waggonis, and- otlher., thiings' 1Ho believed that any reasonable amount of capital they could apply for the puspose of obtaining rolling stock generally would -be more t 'an -saved in the expenses they were at present unavoidably eneountering. IMr. 'W. Fox thought it doubtful whether, if they went tol'arlianment for more capital, they would get new shares token up unless they gave a great preference interest. After somo eonversation the muotion was carried. The dividend recommended in the report was- then declared.- The loan to the Great Western Docks waLs then sanctioned. Mr. IL Cole, a director, was then re-elected, and Messrs. Lockyor and Evens appointed auditors. A vote of thanks to the chairmlan and direcotors concluded tho proceedings. WEST CORNWALL. Thelhalf-yearlyrmeeting of this company was held yesterday at Bristol, Mtr. Louis Vigurs in the chair. Th1 report and statement of accomuts (an abstract of which has appeared in Thc Times) having been read, The CitAISiAN explained the reasons which had induced tlho directors to alter the placo of mieeting from London to Bristol, the latter place being selected on account of a large number of shareholders rosiding in tl.at city, and its being more centrally situated for tho attendance of shareholders residing in Cornwall and other parts. Without pretending for a moment to say that the present state of the undertaking w as entirely satisfactory, he thought it would ho admitted that the aceounts showved a gradual improveient and a. reduction in the working expenses, wbich lio hoped would go on increasing. It was impossible to compare the worling expenses of the West Cornwall with such lines as those of tho Great Westerd, the - London and Brighton, 'r the London and Dover; bnt, taking up The Timcs of yesterday, he saw from the reports of the ,iouth Wales and Vale of Neath Compauies that tloe working expenses of the South Wales amounted to 53 per cent., and the Vale of Neath to B0 per cent., whlile the working expenses of this line were now only about 5ilper cent. thetraffic bein frincipally cotfined to goods ana ninerals, he did not thini he working expenses could be brought below 50 per cent., and to that extent he hoped they might be ultimately reduced. {aving referred to the other points coitained in the report, and offered to give any explanations that muight be required, the Clhairman, in conclusion, mnoved that the rcrot and audited acconnts be received and adop ted.. ZI. C,15 seconded the resolution. MIr. C. B.knleR moved an amenadment, which he afterwards withdrewv, and the resolrution for the adoption of the report was carried unanimously. It was statea that the present amount. of paid-up capital, which would be entitled to dividend, if there were a dividend, was 353,556b., independently of the debenture debt of 167,7997- Mr. BAREIR inoved a resolution, " That a committee of investigation bo appointed to examine into the affairs of the cr unpany, its management, position, and future prospects, to consist of five gentlemen, three of whom to be a quorum, the expenses to be paid out of the funds of the company, such committee to have power to obtain any professional assistance they may require, and to report to the share. holders." Mr. PBOCKTER moved and Dr. GxviS seconded an amendment to the effect thataprofessional accountant should be employed. Mr. PAYTIER supported the original motion, and defended the proccedings -of tbe committee of shareholderE which had been sitting in London. He thouqht that until there had been a thorough and complete investigation of the affairs of the company peace and harmony would not be entirely restored, and the best w ay would be to nimet the inquiry boldly and fairly. Thero was no intention to throw ainyblamiie pernally oil tho dlrectors. Mr. SIOTH, as a director of the Cornwall Railway, had geat pleasure iu saying that lie thought there was alvery Iair chance of the Cornwall Railway bemg opened in 857, and he had a very strong opinion as to the good effect it would have upon the affairs of the West Cornwall. The CirATsmrAs said it vas not the intention of the board of directors to use any proxies in voting upon the question now to be subuiitted to them, or to vote themselves, and, although they held nearly one-fourth of the capital of the company, they w ouldleave the matter entirely int the bands of the shareholdters for decision. 2,fr. T. P. JoSE supported the original motion. -The CILRMAN then puit the amendment, which vas negativedoa by ale majonty, and MIr. Barker's motion was tein put asa substautive resolution. A division tookylace, when tlhere appeared, for the resolution, 11.; against iat 9; The following gentlemen were then appointed as the comn mnittee of investigation:-Messrs. T. P. Jose, 0. C Lane, R. Tweedie, C. Wethan, and G. Barker. Resolutions reducing tho number of directors from 12 to 11, electing the three retiring directors, and appointing Mr. George Thomas auditor in the place of Mr. Josephus Ferris, who retired, were then carried, and a vote of thanks to the chairman closed the proceedings. BIDEFORD. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yesterday at the London Tavern, Mr. Braginton in the chair.- The Secretary read the report, which stated, that the line was opened on the 2d of November last, and the number of Yassengers conveyed over it to the 31st of December was 3,499, and from the Ist of January to the 10th of February 8,087 passengers were conveyed over the railwavy. Arrangeiments were being made for bringing traffic to the loie by means of coaches and other conveyances. The catiit accomut showedthat 46,416. had been received, and 45,2031. expended, leaving a balance of 1,2131. ' Th ClAIRUMA, in moving the adoption of the report, explained that the line was opened in an incomplete state, in order to keep faith with the public, and that consequently the full rent would not be paid by the lessee for sonme tme after the opening, as the state of the roads at that period would not admit of goods trafflc. Mr. TIrX said an abatement in the rent would have to be made up toea certain time, from wshich period the full rent would commence. Resolutions were ped, adopting the report, and reelecting the retiring directors, Messrs. Braginton, Maxell Frith, Shiarland, Cory, WVheelton, Tite, and Warren. Tbe proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the chairman. VAUi OF NEATH. The half-yearly meeting of this company w3s held at Neath yesterday, Visount Villiera, M.P., in the chair. The report, referring to the statement of accounts for the half-year ending the 31st of December last (an abstract of which was published in X7ee Timres of Tuesday), showved that there had been an increase of oO-4 per cent. on the mineral and merchandise traffic compared with the corre sponding half-year of 1854, but a decrease of 3-2 per cent. in passenger traffic, although the actual number of passengers carried showed an increase of 2-6 per cent. guring the half-year there bad been an improvement of 62 per cent. upon the quantity of coal carried, the quantity being 149,167 tons, against 91,950 tons in the corresponding period of 1S54, and it was from this traffic that the increase of 50 per cent. in the mineral and merchandise revenue had. been mainly derived. Means had been adopted for adding to the compay's stock of waggons, the inadequacy of which was referred to in the last report. The company are also pressingupon the other companies the necessity for additional shipping facilities to accommodate the progressive traflic in coaL Additioni is also being made to the accommodation at Briton-ferry. With respect to the maintenance of the permnanent way, the board had determined to replace the rails which require reneval bg rails of a superior quality, the increased cost of which will be far more than compensated by their durability and the diminution of the subsequent outlay. The report recommended the declaration of a dividend at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum, subject to deduction- for income-tax.
