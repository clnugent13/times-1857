The EngEsh funds have been steady to-day, but the uncertainty as to the future course of the money-market checks every tendency to animation. Cousols opened at the closing prices of last evening, 9Jft to -- for money and 94 for the 5th of February, and remained without variation throughout the day. Bank Stock left off at 216 to 218; Reduced, 9.9; to 94k.; New Three per Cents., 94h to - -
India Stock-, 219 to 221 ; Exchequer-bonds, 98 toI 99; and India-bonds and Exchequer-bils, 2s. discount to 2s. premnium.
The pressure in the discount-market is unabated, and at the Bank of England the demand is still active.
Foreign securities were rather heavy, but the operations generally were uninportant. For Turkish Six per Cents, bargains took place at 95 and 94.~1 for money, and 95k- andi ~for the account; the Four per Cents. Guaranteed, for the account, were negotiated at 103g. The other business comprised-Ecuador New Consolidated, 14fi; Granada New Active, 22; Mexican, for the account, 218; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., for the account, 79; Portuguese Three per Cents., 43i and J ; Russian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 96 and 95-i; Sardinian Five per Cents., 882 and 89. - Spanish New Deferred, 23S; Swedish Four per Cents., 85; and Dutch Two-and-a-Half per Cents., 65 and 65i.
In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rate upon Amsterdam was a shade higher. With regard to other places there was no particular alteration.
The corn-market was very dull this morning at the rates of Monday.
The report of the Liverpool cotton-market for the weeks shows a limited business, without any change in quotations.
<'he final prices fromthe PaisBourse this evening again failed to arrive.g
The specie brought by the West India steamer La Plata is 175,0001., of which 86,0001. is gold.
The commercial details from India by the overland mail to-day are again satisfactory, the transactions in manufactured goods having been considerable both at Calcutta and Bombay. The Chinese advices, bringing full details of the operations at Canton down to the 24th of November, and of the continued obstinacy of Governor Yeh, who, notwithstanding the destruction of the Bogue Forts by the English a.nd the Barrier Forts by the Americans, had issued a proclamation, threatening martial law to any of the people wrho might venture to speak of peace, has caused an increase of firmness in the London tea-market. The Shanghai exchadges on this occasion are less unfavourable, the rate having receded from 7s. 5d. to 7s. Sjd.
About 320,0001., principally silver, is already engaged to be shipped by the Peninsular and Oriental steamer Pera, which leaves on the 19th ; and a further quantity would be despatched, but for the difficulty of obtaining an adequate supply. The delivery of the India letters this afternoon may, it is thought, stimulate additional shipments. Owing to the orders known to be on hand, it is believed the amount by the next mail to India and China, on the 4th, wil be at least 500,0001.
In the colonial produce-markets during the week there has not been much activity, and in some cases lower rates have been established, importers showing an increased disposition to realize. The supplies of sugar brought forward at the commencement were again upon a very large scale, and more than adequate to the requirements of the trade. Sales were accordingly made at a reduction of 6d. to Ls. per cwt., but this decline caused more inquiry, andd subsequently a moderate amount of business took place, the market closing with a firmer appearance, unusually small supplies being announced for sale to-day. A floating cargo of Mauritius has been disposed of for this kingdom at 35s. (d. in bond being a full price. Nothmng of interest has transpired in foreign descriptions. Coffee has experienced a further advance of about Is. uponx native Ceylon. Coloury plantation also realized higher iates during the week. Advices received from Colombo to-day report that considerable shipments of the native sorts had been rmade to France. Rice is 3d. lower, only part of the excessive quantity submitted finding buyers. The principal feature in spice has been the sales of cassia lignea. The cargo per Chinsurah, from Canton, being held much above the previous value, was all taken in, which enabled holders of some indirect imports to obtain an advance of 5s. to 6s. Saltpetre remains without material alteration, and the market is stil in a very unsettled state, with sellers of mid-
ling qualities at some further reduction; 38s. has Ieen paid for Bengal expected here in March and April. Of tea only a very small proportion of the gate arrivals have been offered, and these have rtalizedfulprices. Moning and Xarsow descriptions are much inquired for, and have become very Ecarce. Scented orange pekoes are also in great demand. At the public sales on Wednesday and Thursday nearly all the congous were withdrawn, wbile green teas of fine and medium qualities sold at higher rates. Letters from Hongkong, dated the 25th of November, have been received, and the news is considered favourable to an advance in prices.
The following letter gives a concise summary of the facts in the case of "Kingsford v. Merry," and will enable every one to appreciate the state of the law regarding pledges of goods, which is to be taken into consideration at the meeting of merchants and bankers to be held at the London Tavern on Monday next. As it stands at present, according to the admission of Chief Baron Pollock, " No man can be safe, and business in a great conmercial city like London cannot be carried on" :--
" 4, Charlotte-row, Jan. 15, 1857.
"Sir,- -Having carefully examined the whole pleadings in the caue of 'Kingsford and Swinford v. Merry,' I shall feel obliged by your publication of the following epitome of the facts, and judgment of the Court of Error, in order to the due comprehension of the principle involved in that decision, which, if established, will strike at the root, not only of the validity of delivery orders, dock warrantr, and bills of lading, but of the security of aU transaotions in relation either to realty or personalty.
"The simple state of the case is this
"Messrs. W. J. Hall and Company, public warehousekeepers and legal quay wharfingers, received on the 21st of November, 1853, from Messrsm Kingsford and Swinford, nine casks of tartaric acid, their own manufacture, with a delivery order signed by them thus :-'Please receive as under, and hold to our order nine casks,' &c. Messrs. Hall so beld the casks, and so entered their tenure in their public books. Eight days thereafter they receired another dehlvery order from Messrs. Kingsford, thus:.-'Please transfer to the order of Mr. B. Anderson nine casks tartaric acid, Charges to him. (Signed) Kingsford, Klingsford, and Swinford.' A transfer of the goods, holding them to Anderson's order, was made in Messrs. Hall's books accordingly. On the same day Anderson, then in good repute, but otherwise unknown to Messrs. Merry and Son, drng brokers applied to them for an advance on the security of wnart warrants for these and other casks of tartaric acid. Merry received the warrants of Messrs. Hall, the public wharfingers, for these goods, in obedience to Anderson's order, as directed byKingeford's order, above quoted; bondfide advanced 2,0001. on the security of the same, sold them to recover his advance, paid over the r- pins proceeds to the assignee on Anderson's estate, and 13 months afterwards was required by Kingeford and Swinford to pay the proceeds to them, on the ground that Anderson had procured from them the delivery order by fraud.
"- The decision of the Court of Error establishes the principle that by reason of Anderson's fraud the delivery order did not pass the goods to him; that the delivery order being the foundation of the dock warrant, that latter i -strument received the taint of the delivery order, and did not pass the goode to MIe; that, notwithstanding these transfers, the casks stood still the property of Klings. Sord, although their own orderpurported that they transferred them to Anderson; andthathlerryinan actionof trovercouid not resist r^petition of their price to Kinesford. Had 50
Cock warnts, to 50pawnees or purchasers, been negotiated, hingsford would thus have been entitled to follow the g, ods through any conversions, to choose any of the transf. rees or holders he pleased, and to establish his right to recover from all or any of them.
e' L I perfectly understand that property taken from a ereon without his knowledge, or without or against his consent, is recoverable, except where purcbased bond ,fde in market 'overt.' Btut the Court of Error has made no distinction between that felonyandthis fraud, wherethe real w -ners knowingly, and with their own consent, parted with iheir property to Anderson, trusting to his representation, indee, ut etill consenting to the transfer.
" 2. Quoad third parties in. bond f7de, how can the Court ofError hold that the goods were not passed to Anderdon in the teeth of the fact of the order of the oAwners
declaring them to beso transferreda The Conrte-oExche-
*l'er held that the order did pass the'. oods, but that tnqy would have been recoverable if still in Anderson's possession. The Court of Error is forced to ignore Kingsford's order, and deny that it passedthe goods, to get at their reason for cetablishing Kingsford's right of trover.
"3. The deoision permits Kingaford to deny his own written deed and to sa that, although it ordered a transfer to Anderson, they didnot mean sO to transfer.
'. 4^ Te deosipractically Tes dessoE goods to proclaim to tbe world tbat they bave partjd with them, ac that they are at the disposal of another, th;ieJ ien bossdjf,dc pawnees, on the faith of their own order, deat4with that other, they may repudiate entirely their own wzitten conEent.
"5 . Whether Anderson inpetrated the order by fraud or not, to third parties that order gave him the authority, if not of owner, QertaiLy of ageat for the owners, and made
hist daea ifa eference reiUro binding on fherA. If this de. chiion hold, what authority constitutihg a mnan agent or factor for another will henceforth be binding on the prin. cipals, if they choose to swear, which parties can now do, in their own favour, that the authority was impetrated by misrepresentation ?
" 6. If this decision be the rule of law, what will be more easy than for two rogues to act as owner of goods and traasferee, and when the latter has raised a large loan on them to abscond, leaving the confederate to reclaim the goods on the ground, now, as in this case, provable by his own oath, that the transfer was obtained by fraud ?
The royal nmil steamer Orinoco, which sails tcmorrow for the West Indies, takes out 13,6901.
It was stated to-dKy during the trial of Redpath that it is a custom in a stockbroker's office to attest the signature of persons to transfer deeds without requiring them to be present. All knowledge, however, of such an improbable practice is absolutely denied by every member of the Stock-Exchange professing to carry on his business with the slightest regard to prudence and regularity.
The National Discount Company have resoired to declare a dividend of 3s. per share. A. 3ni ai.e of about 1,4001. will remain to be carried ior%ard. The Bank of Egypt intend shortly to hold a meeting, and shareholders are required to sign the deed before the 24th.
T'he last teleg,raphic accounts in the city this evening of the mail steamer Tyne state that the sea was perfectly smooth, and that all the preparations for saving her were going on well. The tide will not allow her to be loated off for two or three days.

MANWCEESTER, JAX 16.
The cotton-market has been exceedingly dull throughout the week, with only 22,000 bales taken by the trade, at a reduction of Id. per lb in prlce. This reaction in the raw material hss led to a general nwilingness among buyers to operate in either yarn or cloth in this market, so that we have had very little business. The extent to which pro. ducers are under contract prevents any pressure for business on their part, and conseouently prices are nominally unchanged, but offers of sauficient magnitude in some quarters would no doubt be mot at a slight reduction on the highest quotations of last week.

At this day's market there was a Tery thin ttendance of the tow.m and country trade, and the businems done was extremely limlted. I5ne wheat mnay be quoted wthout change in value, but some large Daroela. of commonored were pushed off at a reduction of Id. to 2d. per 70mb. Flour met with avr let w sale, and wnas aaIn the turn lower. Oat

REFUSING TO MARRY ON A SUNDAY.-A young man and young woman, wvo had previously obtamed a licence to be married at Kirk Bramwith, near Doncaster, gave notice to the rector, the Rev. F. Maynard, on Saturday evening last, that his services would be required on the following day, when he refused to attend to perform the ceremony, Alleging that Sunday was not a proper day for mnerrymakiDg I Ife was again waited upon during Saturday evening, and informed that the persons who wished to bet married on the following day had friends in attendance, who, would be obliged to return home by an early train on Monday, and that they would be in attendance at any hour that would best suit his convenience. Mr. Maynard, however, again refused to perform the ceremony on the following day unless the wedding party would agree to attend divine service afterwards. Not feeling disposed to do this they repaired on Sunday morning to Barmby Dan, the parish of" the intended bridegroom, for the purpose of prevailing ont the minister there to perform the ceremony. This gentleman, the Rev. J. Duffin, expressed his readiness to comply vith their wish, but found he was unable to do so, as thelicence was madeouttexpresslyforBrammwith. Mr.Duffin, however, advised the party to return to Bramwith, and present themselves before the rector in the church, as he had known in his own experience instances of marriages being performed during Divine service. Acting on this suggestionthe bridal pair and their friends returned to Bramwitb, entered the church, and, just as Mr. Maynard was reading the second lesson, the intended bridegroom advanced to the reading desk and laid the licence before the minister. The, le.sson having been concluded, and nio answer vouchsafed tothe applicant, he said to the minister, "I wiU thank you. Sir, to say whether you will or not;" but Mr. Maynard made no reply, and threw the document behind the pulpit !
The person who had uiresented it picked it up, and with his. friends left the church. He subseauently went to Doncaster and stated the whole affair to Dr. Sharpe, the vicar there, who had granted the license. Ile expressed his surprise at what had occurred, and at once altered the license so as to allow of tho marriage taking place at Bariuby Dan.. They were accordingly married at the church at that place.
on the following day, in the course of which a note was de-- hvered to the father of the bride from Mr. Maynard, intimating that if Joseph Scholes (the bridesroom) did not appear before him that day in " a quiet and respectful manner" and consent to the terms then to be proffered to him. they would be summoned to appear in court to answer the charge which would be laid against them. No notice was, of course, taken of this epistle, and the rev. gentleman has obtained a summons againist the two young men for disturbing the congregation during Divine service, and the case wilU be heard by the West Riding magistrates to-day (Saturday).

tA portion of ths following appeared in our second {edition ot ye9terdAV:_1
By the arrival of the overland mail we have reeelved our private correspondence and files of paper3 fiom Caldutta to the 8th of December, and from Bombay to the 17th of December.
Our Bombay correspondent writes
"BOMhBAY, Dxc. 17.
At last I am able to announce to you with cerWsinty that the Persians are in Herat. The report of the faU of the place, which reached us from Lahors just in time to find a place in my letter of the 3d, has E nce been fully conrmed. It is a year this day since, as may be remembered, I w,rote of the revolution that had taken place in the government of thisfrontier town, of the overthrow of the family of 'Yar Mahomecl, and the rise to power of the Shahxadeh Yusuf. This event was then regarded and -announced as a capture of Herat by the Persians, it being supposed that it was by the aid of Persian -troops that Yusuf obtained his advantage, and that the price demanded for the assistance was vassalage to the Court of Teheran. Bat it afterwards appeared that the Prince was indebted for his success to intestine dissension xather than to foreign levies, and for a while he Auzintained his position, ostensibly at least, as an
independent ruler. Soon, however, with the growdog strength of the anti-Persian party under Esa Khan, his leaning towards the other side became umore and more clearly manifest, till upon the appearance of the Shah's forces in his neighbourhood he betook himself to the friendly shelter of their -camp. Then commenced the siege of Herat, which lasted-marked, a.s far as we are aware, by few -acts of daring and active heroism, and bearing rather the character of a blockade-tiU the 25th of -October. On that day it appears that Esa Kban ,surrendered. He is said to have long despaired of saving the place, straitened as he was in men, ma-teral, and, above all, in provisions, and to have eopcned negotiations with the Persian General for its surrender some time back. The terms le proposed were of a nature so favour-able to himself and his family that a reference to Teheran was deemed advisable, and, ipending the Shah's answer, the sieoe continued. at length arrived from the capital theiRoyal firman, assuring to Esa Khan the liv¢s of himself and his family, and to the inhabitants generally quarter and hronourable treatment. Communications were renewed, and the fortress and town were at once surrendered. Esa Khan and his principal followers waode out to the enemy's camp, and gave themselves up. The Prince of Persia received them at -his durbar with the usual Eastern testimonials of esteem, dresses of honour and purses of gold, and despatched them to Teheran with a gtuard -or escort of 1,000 horse. TraveUers from Meshed, bound for Affghanistan, met the caval-eade on its way to the capital, and, proceeding,
to the fallen city, found the gates open and the Persinas in peaceable occupation. Thus disappears the Heratee Chief-somewhat ingloriously after his bold -and brilliant de1bgt-and thus has the Shah accomplished the violation of his treaty with England of three years ago.
" Of Persian advances on the great road to Can-dahar we have renewed and repeated rumours. The lsouthern capital of Affghanistan is endangered by the defeat of Hyder Ehan, commanding the advanced post of Ghirisk. Hyder was pressing -ids father for assistance; indeed, according to ,one account, he had set off for Cabul in all haste, -with only 100 horse. However, the principal motive of this journey is stated to be the wish both -of himself and his father, the Ameer, that he should be present at the impending interview between the latter and Sir John Lawrence, the Chief Commissioner of the Punjab. That such a meeting was to take place the Delhi Gazette announces as
probable, or rather nearly certain." On the one hand, Cabul letters of the 25th of November spoke of the Dost's camp equipage having been already -sent forward on the Jellalabad road; and we now hear from Peshawur that he was expected to arrive at Jumrood, a few miles from that station and just -vithin our border, on the 5th of next month. On the other hand, Sir John Lawrence arrived at Peshawur on the 29th of November, ostensibly, however, with the sole object of visiting a neighbouring locality proposed as the site of a sanitarium. But that he -was about to receive the old Affghan chief was very generally beheved. What would be the questions discussed at such a meeting I of course cannot say with precision, and I forbear to conjecture. There are thos5e who believe that they perceive symptoms of a coming occupation of Affghanistan by a British -force. With regard to the pohey of such a proceeding mnen w ill differ in England as men differ here. l',y the majority it wil perhaps be deprecated, and possibly with reason. Yet, although the disastrous issue of our first expedition is full of warning, other things besi i .s that * terrible winter march de-serve no less to be called to mind. NVe must not forget the I mural crown' of Jellalabad, nor the tri-umiphant progress of Pollock, nor Gilbert's -wild chase of the Aflghan horse after the battle of Guzerat. Above all, it should I:e considered how much of our disaster was due to political blunders in our dealings with the Aflghan tribes-blunders of which the huge proportions are perfectly visible to all in these days. Add, moreover, that between our frontier and the Western Mountains are no longer independent Sikh and Belooch States of doubtful temper, and we may perhaps find that something is to be said on the less popular or occupation side of the question.
"Accounts from the force under Brigadier Chamberlain, which I have before mentioned as being on foot among the Affghan hills, come down to the 21st of N ovember. The troops were then only six marches from Cabul, but whether they were about to advance upon that capital is not known with any certainty. All had gone well with them up to that date. A tribe that had been threatening to be refractory, aud of w hich the coercion was the object or one of the objects of the movement, had succumbed at sight of so large a force without firing a shot. A certain number of sick they had, but these were left bebind, well guarded and in a strong position, and, with the exception of the difficulties inseparable from a road aimost impassable in places, there appeared nothing to hinder a march to the gates of Cabul.
" Later news from Peshawur, dated theE7th inst., -which arrived while I was writing the above, speaks -with certainty of the approach of the Dost, and fixes the 10th as the probable date of his arrival. Two Queen's Regiments, the 70th and the 27th, -were expected to arrive at the station about the same time, and, as the two corps which they would in the natural course of things relieve had not received Qrders to march, it was surmised that an assemblage of troops niight be commencing for service beyond the Khyber Pass.
I I Ve are now in daily expectation of hearing of the fall of Busbire. I have before stated that until that -event should take place no despatches were looked for by the Government. An Arab vessel has, however, brought us news of the fleet from Muscat, or rather of the third division of the fleet, conveying the General, the head-quarters staff, and the Admiral in command. This, the last portion of the expedition, left Bombay on the night of the 13th of November, and anehored off Muscat on the morning of the 19th. There they wereto remain 24 hours to deliver despatches for the linaum, and to fill up coal and water. The next halting-place would
De Isunder Abbas, on the other or Persian Fide of the Golf, the rendezvous for the whole fleet. In my next I shall no doubt be able to tell you of the occupation, whether bloodless or otherwise, of the Persian port. Of the preparations on the part of the enemy to meet the approaching storm I have still nothing to say, or nothinng but rumours of a -cc nsistency as thin as that which characterized the
stories to wlhich I shortly alluded in my last letter. One journal authenticates a statement that 26,000 men were assembled at Bushire, prepared to give the fleet and army a warm reception. Another renews the report of the recent erection of formidable batteiiupon a little low island off the port. These
se mf to be the least improbable of the various reports, and as such, and such only, I give them.
" The Government of Bombay and the Comman-
-der-in-Chief have published separate notifications, a
highly eulogistic of the various departments and offlicers upon whom the preparation and despatch -of this Persian expedition devolved. The fonner of these papers commences by giving the dates of the
primaryad final orders from England and Calcutta
and of the sailing of the fleet, in proof of quicknessp of action. They have appeared in previous letters but 1 may recapitulate them. Orders for the prepsration of the foree arrived on the 22d of August, orders for its dIapatchonthe23d~ of Octobenfinalordersfromthle
SapremoeGdernmient on the 9th of November, afi'd the flagship and the last divisiois of the fleet sailed on the 13th, or four days later. The strength of the expedition is then detailed. Of fighting men there were embarked 5,670, of whom 2,270 were Earo peans, with 3,750 followers, 1,150 horses, and 430 bullocks. The fleet numbers in all 45 sail, and consists of eight war steamers of the Indian Navy, and of hired transports seven steamers and 30 Bailing vessels. The special thanks of the Government are then offered to Sir Ecnry Somerset and Sir Henry Leeke, as heads of the Army and Navy respectively, and to the heads of the Commissariat, Ordnance, and Engineer departments. The Commander-inChief, in his general order, is not less complimentary to the departments of the Adjutant-General and Quartermaster-General, to the Medical Board, and to the Committee of Embarcation.
" At Bombay, both in the import and export markets, there is considerable activity. Money is in demand, and the local banks have raised their rates of interest onc per cent, all round. Exchange on London, at six months' sight, 2s. 2jd."
The following is the letter of our Calcutta ^orrespondent:
"CALCUTTA, DEc. 8.
Amid the cloud of stories and rumours which reach us from Affghanistan, one fact, at least, is clear,the Ameer, harassed by intestine dissensions, by the advance of the Persians, and by the defection of his troops, cannot hold his ground without British assistance. It appears certain, though the secret i4 well kept, that it will be afforded him in the most efficacious form. Brigadier Chamberlain, with about 5,000 efficient men, was recently ordered oa an expedition ostensibly directed against a refractory frontier tribe. On the 21st of November, however, this force was at Suffeid Koh, a little to the west of Jellalabad, and about six marches from Cabul. Its destination is the city of Cabul, and, as it advances unopposed, it must have been sent at the request of the Ameer. It is believed that the force will garrison the capital, leaving Dost Mahomed free to operate on his frontier. The British name, however, is still great in Central Asia. The mere rumour that we are actively interested in favour of the Afighan leader will bring thousands of warriors to his standard. The force probably convoys treasure, and a small donation to the troops will excite hopes, all of them beneficial to the Ameer's recruiting officers. It is certain, too, that Sir John Lawrence, the most determined of Indian diplomatists, meets Dost Mahomed, probably near the Khyber, to arrange the terms on which further assistance will be rendered. The nature of this assistance must depend upon the position to wbich our ally has been reduced. Dost 3ahomed will not ask for men if he can help it, for the belief that the foot of the Anglo-Saxon never recedes has its weight even with his powerful intellect. But it would appear certain that he cannot hold his own, and, as we dare not surrender the mountain ranges to Persia, we must assist him, at any sacrifice. The force of this argument will scarcely, perhaps, be appreciated in England, but it is familiar to every Anglo-Indian, and it is by no means clear that this policy is not the best even for Europe. Of course, it matters nothing to anybody whither the Persian donminions extend; but the Persian donlinions are for military purposes Russian dominions, and it may be the wisest coutse to fight Russia here. The Friend of India thus puts the whole case:-
" I If, however, this effort must be made, England must bear her part. She must send troops. We have only 4,000 Europeans really available for the struggle, and we want 20,000. She must also send money. I do not mean that England must be taxed. Unjust as such a proceeding may be deemed, India will bave to pay the bill, but it may be rendered easier by allowing the Indian Government to raise the mneney at home. The 4.' per cent. loan has been impeded by these operations. The merchants and the services are impressed with the idea that a 5 per cent. loan is imminent, and the money conies in very slowly. Aceording to one account only 16 lakhs, or l60,000Z., has been paid in. That is probably below the truth, but the Fours have sunk to 17 per cent. discount. It is this consideration which harasses the Government of India. Every movement is directed by orders from home, given by men who do not perceive the fearful gravity of the measures they enforce, whileIIndia, but just escaped from a great financial crisis, is called on not only to pay the bill, but to find the advances.'
" Nothing has yet been heard on this side of India of the Persian expedition. It is, however, believed that a demand for 10,000 men has been made upon Bengal. Whether they will be required is, of course, uncertain, but several European regiments have received orders to hold themselves in readiness. They must, however, march to Bombay. Government has no steamers to carry them, sailing vessels would be too slow, and private steamers cannot be obtained without suspending some of the mail lines.
" As I write, the telegraph brings intelligence of the bombardnient of Canton. We cannot, therefore, hope for aid from the Chinese squadron, and it will be well if the authorities at Hongkong abstain from calling on India for assistance. We could despatch sailing vessels from Madras certainly, but if Hongkong is in any danger the relief will come somewhat tardily. The fact is one of the thousand which prove how wise was Lord Dalhousie's resolve to give India a real navy.
"II confess that I look with some degree of apprehension upon the present position of affairs. We appear to be drifting rapidly into a position which will compel us to hold Aflghanistan, and perhaps to invade Persia with a force sufficient to crush all opposition. If England is prepared for that result, all is well. 10,000 troops and 4,000,0001. sterling
would enable this Government permanently to| arrest the Russian advance to the south. But if the war is to be a Minister's war, if India is to fight the battle without hearty assistance from the British Parliament, I fear for the result. We must win, but it will be at a cost which may throw the finances into most dangerous confusion. The Burmese war was fought cheaply, because the troops were conveyed by sea, the commissariat could be supplied in part on the spot, and we had Lord Dalhousie at the helm. In the present instance we have none of these advantages. The troops must march, andc from the moment they cross the frontier must rely on the Punjab for supplies. Even in Persia the expedition will probably be compelled to depend on the shipping-certainly if the Persians carry out their traditional policy of desolating the cotuntry.
"The varisalmnostthesoletopicof discussion, but the work of reform has not yet been stopped. The n5ew penal code is to be read a first time on the 20th inst., and the new code of procedure immediately after. The bill for securing limited liability has passed its second reading. It is anxiously expected. 'T'here are many undertakings for which individuals have not sufficient capital, and which small companies will attempt. Officers and natives, each with 3,C001. or 4,0001., will gladly invest th§ir money in projects which yield from 10 to 20 per cent., provided that if all is lost they can fall back on their incomes untouched. The dread of unlimited responsibility, is of course, tenfold in a country like this, 'where men only begin to save as they advance in life, and where patrimonial property is, among Europeans, almost unknown.
" The despatch sanctioning the arrangements for an university has arrived. The senate, which will, in fact, constitute the university, will comprise every member of the Government, most of the secretaries, two or three missionaries, one or two professors, and several natives. They will grant the degrees of Master and Bachelor of Arts, and Bachelor of Law. The missionary colleges will be most of them affili-
atet to the university, and the graduates wv i doubt-
less secure almost a monopoly of place. The examiners will be independent and paid for their work,-in this country an important proviso. There appears to be little doubt that the institution will secure a higher standard of education among the wealtbier classes. Some cxtraordinary facts, however, have recently been disclosed as to the cost of this education. Each boy educated at the Presidency College costs, apparently, upwards of 401. a-year, and these lads are all the sons of wealthy parents. 401. a-year is a third of the salary of a native judge, and seems thrown away in providing education for men so wealthy.
" An order has also arrived sanctioning some remedial measures for the Bengal police. The home authorities lay down two principles,-that there shall be a preventive as well as a detective policean Irish constabulary, that is, as well as a London police-and that the magistrate sball be relieved of his duties as thieftaker. The principles laid down are satisfactory, but the institution of village police is unnoticed, and until that is reorganized or abolished any reform must be partia]ly inoperative. In the Santal Pergunnabs Mr. Halliday has tried the experiment of placing them in direct cemmunication with the European officials wvith the happiest results. This plan may perhaps be further extended, but in the Santal Pergunnahs the ancient or village system is in full vigour. In the rest of Bengal itis dead.
"The Government 13 refwed to li4ten to the
petiMion of the missionaries for an inquiry into the 6ocial evils of Bengal. It assigns no reason, andthe missionaries have determined to ippeal to Parliament. The inquiry would doubtlems elicit nmclh ill feeling; all such inquiriea do. But it is difficult to perceive what ill effect could result from laying bare sores which the surgeon has nerve and .kill enough to heaL At all events, an inquiry could only tend to elicit facts as to the actual position of the peasant-the great problem of Bengal. Is he a pauper, or a yeoman? The Government decline3 even to ask,-not from want of interest, but from dread of increasing that hatred of classes which is slowlybecoming manifest. To their credit be it said, they are prepared to make any sacrifice to remove a proved evil, but they are afraid of rousing questions the present generation will be unable to decide. I question the safety as well as the wisdom of this policy."
'; CHINA.
We have received the China Mail Extra, dated Rongkong, November 24, being nine days' later intelligence than that received by the last maiL
We extract the followingc
"The clipper steamer Lancefield, to leave to-morrow, the 25th, wviU reach Calcutta, no doubt, before the despatch thence of the first overlandmail inJanuary, and we avail ourselves of the opportunity to furnish our readers with a reprint of the news published by us since the despatch of the mail on the 15th inst. The most stirring of events have been an insane attack by Imperialists on boats from United States' ships of war, and the well-merited punishment which followed the firing on them.
"The Barrier Forts being entirely demolished, the Amenieans intend to retire from the quarrel, it is said, and wait the issue of Admiral Seymour's demonstration before again operating. The French have also withdrawn their men-ofwar's men from the factories, and, report has it, have taken possession of the Liptat Forts on one of the branches of the river. These they intend holding pending the arrangement of some matters which they, too, have to present to the Government of China, the recent crel torture and murder of the missionary Chapdelaine havingyet to be explained to the authority qualified to receive the explanation--M. de Montigny- now on his way here from Cochin China.
" Disappointed in the hope of bringing the Canton Government to a proper sense of duty by the harsh means reported in our last summary, Admiral Seymour now relies, apparently, and with reason, on coercion by the people. With this, or some such view, his Excellency is intrenching the foreign quarter, has had captured junks filled with the remains of demolished forts, and is sinkiDng them in those parts of the river where danger from fire-rafts has to be apprehended-booming off those tracks which it may be found necessary to open on an early occasion. Every native boat that approaches the factories is fired on though few, since the Niger has been guardship, have had the temerity to come within reach of her unsparing sharpshooters.
"A covered way from the British factory to the south. west corner of the city wall is in contemplation too it is reported, so renderiug the next attack on the city a work of comparative ease and safety. In place of the withdrawn French and American guards, some companies of Her Majesty's 59th Regiment have been sent hence, though but few are required, 100 English bayonets, properly disposed, being quite sufficient to keep at bay as many Chinese as can he brought against them on the land side ; and it would be quite possible for Admiral Seymour, even with the force at present under his control, to take possession of and to hold securely all that quarter of the new city extending west from the Governor-General's official residence, and north up to the wall of the old city, distant but a few yards from the extremity of the building spoken of
" As a specimen of Yeh's still continued obstinacy, we give below the last 'edict':-
"' PROCLUITroN.
"'Yeh, Governor-General of the Two Xwang, issues this edict for the soldiers and people. Since I have taken charge of my office I have been indebted to you-the people. You have looked upon me as your father, and I have looked upon you as children. Four years ago the rebels arose in several hundreds of thousands, and you ventured with united strength to resist them, which was very meritorious, not leaving a fragment of their remains. Even until now you have manifested your merits in behalf of the country. Now the barbarian rebels have raised disturbances, attacking our heavenly dynasty, destroying forts, burning the shops, and making war on the city. The anxiety on this account has entered into my very bones and marrow; and your united wrath, too, has been aroused. Now, I have received the Imperial commands" firmly to hold and resolutely to fight and maintain the war from the public Treasury; to blockade the river and sea, and to sweep out every fragment." You must, in behalf of the empire, exert your strength as brave soldiers, in order that not a fragment of the foreign robbers may remain. In case there should be any speaking of pleace, the speaker shall be dealt with according to martial law. Did I not love the people as children the barbarian rebels certainly would deceive them. You must be faithful, and, with a pure heart, tremblingly obey.'
" Governor Bowring, greatly to the satisfaction of the many who feared that his Excellency while in Canton would induce a change in the present bold and wise career, returned to the colony yesterday, anl it is hoped will keep aloof from matters which are quite above his speculative imagination and ability to control. Until the arrival of reinforcements matters are expected to remain in stQai quo.

"CAPTURE OF THE BARRIER FORTS BY THE
AMERICANS.
"The future plan of operations having been agreed upon by the three commanders, early on Friday morning the Cum-fa towed the Levant into a position much nearer the forts, the Barrier stakes alone preventing further progress. The boats of both ships were then manned with a storming party, and the capture of the fort at the entrance of Fidler's Reach resolved on. At S a.m. the little Cum-fa (under the able direction of Volunteer Captain W. M. Robinet), with the launches and cutters in tow, started for the fort under cover of the Levant's guns, and in the face of a galling fire from the three forts. The shot whistled and roared over and around her, but she escaped without injury, and returned to the ships unscathed, after having been exposed to a sharp fire for upwards of an hour, amid the hearty cheers and congratulations of all hands' But not so with the boats. A large 8-inch shot struck the San Jacinto's launch, in charge of First Lieutenant Lewis of that ship, on the starboard bow, killing one man instantly, n,ortally wounding two others, who died shortly afterwards, and wounding two or three slightly. The shot was a hollow one, and after striking the bread bag in the stern of the boat quietly reposed there, and remains a captive to the boat's company. The landing was effected without further trouble, and, although the men had to cross a deep ditch up to their knees, and some to their waistbands, the stars and stripes were upon the fort in 10 minutes, The landing party reaehed the fort with but one man injured by a rocket from the retreating Chinese.
" The party enstered the fort at about 9 o'clock, andl tho
work of destrction commenced. The buildigs wvere all set fire to and destroyed; powder and shot thrown into the rivEr, and everything that could be burnt was destroyed. Such guns as could be burst were sent into fragnients - those that could not were spiked, trunnions blown off, aud
so defaced as to be made useless. This fort mounted 48 guns, none of which were less than 24-pounders, and some as high as 40 catties. Two of them were beautiful brass guns,which the landing party turned upon the opposite forts Nvith much effect, to which, however, the Chinese replied with vigour, but without loss to the American side. The work of demolition occupied til past noon, when it became necessary to take measures for further proceedings, and the capture of the Island, or Round Fort, was then determined upon. Through the able advice of a gentleman volunteer present, well skied in Chinese warfare and local information, a aplan was decided upon, and at about 3 p.m. the troops E ied out of the western gate, and, under cover of the raised bund or road along the river's side, marched up to a point opposite to the southern door of the Round Fort and in the line of the Square Fort, while the boats were being tracked up along tho shore. While here, waiting for the boats to come up, tome Chinese soldiers made a sally from behind the hll at the Lob Creek pagoda, and discharged voleys of arrows and rockets, but vwth no effect. They were speedily driven back by the Marines and the Portsmouth's howitzer, and made good their retreat to Honam Island. By this time the boats had arrived at the embarcation, seeing which the. Chinese troops in the Round Fort, knowing that it was aU up with them, speedily took to their heels, and the forces landed without opposition at 4 p.m. Thus three of the four forts were captured with the loss of five lilled and five wounded on boat and shore duty, and two wounded on board the ships. Tho Lovant suffered but little - two shots in her hull, one throngh into the berth dck, mainstay shot away, and one 32.

"The commanders immediately determined upon their lanof operations, and by 12 o'clock at night the Fidler's
ach ort was vacated, the total force quietly bivouacking in the Island Fort About midnight the moon arose, and although Chinese soldiers might be seen hurying to and from the Square Fort, not 600 yards opposite, at 4 am on Saturday morning all hands were c ed, after a few hors' repose on the cold granite
ors of the fort, and the separate divisions were ordered qaietly ito their respective boats. All prepara-
tions were made for the attack by tbe dawn of dJy; l threehowitrers, with their crew.3 and ammunition, were statimed in the ports on the northern aide commanding the Square Fort, and at 5h. 45m. the boats pushed off. As they opened out from the t'ort the order was given to fire, and,
under cover of tho three howitzers, which kept up a wither- i iog fire of shrapnel upon the opposite fort, into its centre, through the portholes, and upon the retreating troops, the boats tonched tho orposite shore after having been exposed to the raking fire o eight umns, loaded with round shot and grape, and in 15 minutes from the embarcation the flowery flag was upon the ramparts of their last skronghold. Althougn it was a perfect shower of grape over, about, and around them, the boats escaped without injury or a man wotnded. The IslandFort keptup a fireupon theretreating Celestials until they were out of reach; and, although they rallied once or twice, and hononred the victors with a ahower of rockets, the advance howitzers drove them back several miles under cover of the villages in the eastern suburbs of Canton. The rest of the day was occupied in the destruction of the two last captured forts; andtis to be hoped that ere the ships withdraw they wll raze them to the ground, They were defended by
g of enormous calibre-say, from 8 to 11 inch; and the Maour of destroying them in earnest cannot well be conceived. There were-

which are either totally destroyed, or rendered unfit for further service. The fortifications were neateriaUy injared by the ship's fire, and the loss of 165 guns and the destruction of his most important defences in the very stronghold of the empire must teach lis Majesty's Hon. Member of the Privy Council,Mr.Yeh Mding Chin, a lesson in foreign diplomacy he will not soon forget.
All the officers as well as men vied with each other in acts of daring; and too much praise cannot be bestowed upon the gaant Commanders Foote, Bell, and Smith, for their courageous determination; on Lieutenants Lewis, Watmaugh,- Guthrie, DavenpoAt, English, Carter, and Sinpson, for the gaUant manner in which they led their separate diisions into action; on Masters Adams, Shepard, and Lieutenant Belknap, for their very able performances on that musical instrument caUed a howit7er, which sounded the death kneU to many a foe; on Captain Simms and his gallant corpe of Marines, who were ever readJy to mete out to the fee his deserts, and topreve the honour of that fla;g utarnished; and, lastly, on the remaiaing defenders of the shipe,who did their part and were eager
(ANOTHER ACCOuNT.)
"O Saturda, the 16th i" Canton, Nov. 19, 1856.
On Sturay, he 5thinst., the first cutter of tha United States' ship Portsmouth, containing Captain Foote and others, was proceeding from Whampoa to Cantoa, when she was fire upon from the Barrier Forts. It was half-pas' 4in the afternoon when this occurred. The American flag was in a position that does away with aU chance of a plea of mistaking it, while no less than two round shot and three charges of grape after the round shot were fired I into the boat by the Chinese 'braves.'
" At the fint discharge of grape the boat was turned for the ships, where she arrived at 6 o'clock, and after an hour Commodore Armstrong decided upon taking possession of the two forts, and then advising the Governor of Canton of what had occurred. The insult having been avenged, the ' property' might have been returned to its rightful owner, or retained, according as the reply from Governor Yeh might indicate a wish for war or peace with the Americans.
"At daylight on Sanday the San Jacinto's cutter commenced sounding the river from Whampoa to the Barrier, which was accomplished after the loss of a man from a shot while throwing the lead. At 4 p.m., 24 hours after the Portsmouth's boat had been fired into, that ship and the Levant were nearly in position to open fire. With only water enough to float the Portsmouth, she was towed up to her berth by the WiUamette, in the most galant style on Captain Curry's part, who was for many minutes in the minit of a hot fire from the forts, which had opened long before the ship was near enough to suit Captain Foote. After the steamer had been ordered to 'e st off and take care of herself,' Captain Foote dropped with the flood for five minutes till within 450 yards' distance of the nearest fort (the large one at the right end of the barrier), having then been under heav fire for some time. 'Starboard'-' Let go anehor'-' Eaul in sprin7''Fire!' came in quick succession, and, tocatnaystory short, the ship fired 220 8-inch shells in the following 2 hours and 15 minutes.
" All were well placed at their nearest neighbour aud at the Round Fort on the left, eome 1,400 yards distant. At dark firing ceased, the forts keeping it up till 15 minutes before the ship stopped, and giving a sample of what is in store at the French Folly at this time. The two forts aro said to be filled with English guns and junk-men crews, and certainly we have never seen anyth ing in the way of Chinese gunnery before to equal them.
During this time the Levant was aground, out of fire, and could not take part in the action. The Portsmouth wvas huled three times, one marine mortally wounded, and her rigging badly cut.
"After the fire it was not deemed prudent to send away boats from the ship, as the latter required their whole crews to take care of them in the position they held, and having no steam to move down with. On Monday morning the Cum-fa embarked the balance of men from Canton, for the purpose of manning boats and taking possession."

CALCUTTA MARKET.
(From the Calcutta Engliahman of Dec. 8.)
Since our last issue, under date the 22d ult., we have been in receipt of intelligence from London to tho 26th October
last, firt by the electric telegraph from Bombay and sub-
sequently by the arrival on the 1st inst. of the mail screw steamer Alma. London advicos to the 10th nlt. reached us yesterday by electric telegraph from Bombay.
Mr. Lindsay's steamer the Tynemouth, which left En-
land on the 6th September last for India viU the Cape, is still keeping out. Her arrival at Madras is not yet announced.
During the past fortnight our produce-market has scarcely shown signs of activity, and on the whole we have but a limited amount of operations to report. Indigo has continued in excellent request, and at the two public sales we bave had buyers displayed much wilingness to purchase, many of the pareels fetching higher prices than previou3ly anticipated. Little has been done in sugar for Great Britain, the high prices still pJaid by the native shippers for Bombay l?eventing Englfsh buyers from operating. We have had little inquiry for saltpetre either for the United States or Great Britain, and the market has assumed a downward tendency. Silk continued neglected until the last few days, when some parcels of mediam and fine sorts were placed at previous figures, there being hardly any de-
mand forthe low qualities. In corabs very little has been done, although the value is considerably lower than at the date of our last. Jute has been inbetter request and prices have an upward tendency. Lac-dye and abell-lac remain
unaltered. Hides and skins have improved both in demand.
A fair anount of transactions have taken place. in our import-market. For British piece too& 'we have had a steady demand, though in som# In, &tasme hAolders have arbwitW4 tQ a rAedu.tu ia
prices. Gray shartings have been placed to a fairextent but at a declint of two annas £-piece. Tarkey red goods tDo gether with prints and chintzes have likewise been in les, request and sals have been qeffted at lower pdoes In mule twist we hare not had much doing, and dealers have nsuceodedin securing their demanldsat a slight coucesnion. All sorts of metab excepting oDpper COntinUe very Arm, and an i'nproved demand in fulfilment of orders from the Upper Provinces has in sme instances enabled holders ts effect sales at an advance.
MONKY-MAuRKY.T
We reported in our IAt that money was hecorninz slightly tighter in the bazaar, in consequence of which, we believe, the Directors of the Bank of Bengal at their meet. ing on the 27th nlt, reduced the rates of interost and discount 1 per cent. all round, and increased the mnargin on loans on yoernment securities by Ave per cent., making the same 20 percent. This will naturally tend to render the money-marke: tighter. and has already affected the value of public securities. We insert below the statement of liabilities and assets of the Bengal Bank forthe week endingon 3dinst.,which in comparison tothe statementof thel2th ult., inserted in our last. shows a decrease in the amount of eash from Co.' Re. 16S,53,817-15 to Co.'s Rs. 136,25,497-7-3. The 41 per Cent. Loan continues to draw subscrptions very slowly, scarcely twenty lacs having been, it is said, gubsEcribed to date.

Sharea.-Some transactions are reported in the share. market. We hear of sales of Bengal Coal Company's Shares at 1,370rs. each, being a few rupees lower than our previous quotations, Calcutta Steam Tug Company's at 1,170rs. each, and of Docking Company's at 800rs. Bank of Bengal Shares are held at about 6.400rs. each.
Government Securities.-Consequent on the advancein the ratesof interest and discount charged bytheBengal Bank, and the increase of the margin on loans, Government securities have experienced furtber depreciation, Co.'s Fours having the last two dayschangedhandsat 16. 4r. tol6. 8r. and Sicca Fours at 17.8. We have sellers of Company's Fives at Rs. 2-4 per cent. premium. and for the 33 per Cents, no better than 35r. per cent. discount could be bad. Stock receipts contmue nominal at 8 per cent. preminm. On the whole, transactions during the fortnight have been very limi-A.
EXCELRrGH.
On London.-A large business has been done for the out going mail at steadily advancing rates. The first sales of credits were made at 2s. 2d., but theserates gradually crept up to 2s. 2d. and latterly to 2s. 2gd., at which our market closes Some transactions have likewiso taken place in credits at the last-mentioned figure, i.r., 2s, 2id. per rupee, for the mail of the 22d inst. Document bills have been placed at 2s.2id.
On China.-Nothing further has transpired since our last. Freights.-Notwithstanding the numerons arrivals from different quarters during the past fortnight, our rates have continued steady. For London and Liverpool tonnage to a fair extent has been taken up at almost our last quotations ; though, in some instances wlhere cargo was required immediately, a slight concession has been obtained by ship. pers of rice. The new crops of table and Balam rice have commenced to arrive. and, if prices rule moderate, the rates of freight to Great Britain might assume an upward tendency, though the available tonnage in our port is still large. For Americaoffers arenot very abundant, and for a large ship nothing above $10 a-ton would be given. In country freights we do not observe any alteration, with the exception of the rate of cotton to China, of which a quan. fti has benengaged at $2 '6 a-bale.

He is the brother of Mlr. 0. Bowdlen, of Soulbury, upon whose farm Baron Rothschsild's hounds met with their death, and upon whose lands the poi. soned foxes were found. The case was heard before Mr. P. Dauney nd M. E W. ownes o th 13th inst. Mr. JohnBowdn, arme, Swuborne,wasthe defendant.

Maliciously Cutting The Telegraph Wires.
MALICoOusLY CuTraG THE TELEGRAPH W giP. s. -A young man who was dressed as a labourer, and who gave the name of John Hill, was yesterday brought before the county magistrates at Rochester, charged with having feloniously cu off and stolen a portion of the telegraps wires belonging to the European and American Telegraph C impany. The company have been engaged for some timie past in taking up and relaying their wires, which are carried under ground, between London and Dover, during the pro. gress of which undertaling they have been xubjectec ro eontinual annoyances and depredations throngh their wires havingbeencutandcarried away.

London, Saturday, January 17, 1857.
LONDON. SATURDAY, JANUARY 17 1857.
By the aid of a very strong presumption as to the probable bias of the Edintlnogh Beview, and by the light of an occasional sneer, we believe we may say that an article on0lndia, Persia, and Affghanistan in that periodical is intended to show that, perhaps, our war with the second of those countries is not so causeless, so aimless, or likely to be so fruitless, as most people had imagined. The article is a history of our relations with Persia and Affghanistan since the beginning of the century, giving as much prominence to Herat as the ahnost fabulous character of that city will allow. They who assert a substantial existence and fied political relations for that city have had a considerable godsend in a MS. of a " Caravan journey and "w anderings in those regions," by a certain French officer, for some time in the service of the SHAII, who spent a long time in various unsuccessful attempts to reach Lahore. The MS. is made the nominal subject of the article, and was our inducement to read it. Now, that there is such a MS., that J. P. Fsnarsn has existed, and may even still exist, and that he visited those regions, we will not be so uncivil as to doubt; but we are bound to say, that when the object is to thrqw light upon a spot of geographical and political darkness, it is explaining obscutrum per obscurius to refer us to an unpublished French MS. by an unknown writer, translated by Captain JEsss, edited by Mr. H. DANBY SEYMOU12, and annotated on by Sir Hmi-xy RAwLANsOw and Sir JoH Loonr. As the Reviewer observes, "Few books have "appeared before the public under more di8"tinguished sponsorship." In fact, four gentlemen of authQrity and reputation, Oriental scholars, and interpreters of primieval tongues, are employed to drag the reluctant witness into the box, and explain what he says. On seeing the fiood of light about to be poured upon us, and the tremendous apparatus engaged to wield it, we were ready to hide our diminished heads, and believe in Herat, the traditional " Gate of India." To our utter surprise, however, and our un4ffected disappointment, the Reviewer not only makes hardly any use of " General FzRxr-a," and his four godfathers, but in almost every instance where he does allude to them it is to contradict them
flatly. General FE3ER=n did, it appears, get to Herat, and at this crisis we did expect ho was to tell us something about it. Indeed, as the Reviewer assures us, "he supplies much information " which cannot fail to be serviceable to those who 'task where and what Herat is." The particular information, however, and all the information announced by this flourish, is that, " from the " peasant to the highest functionary, every one hai8
"ready access to YAu MAuo.NoaD. He gives up, "six hours every day to hear complaints and "listen to the petitions of his subjects, and deals " out prompt, equitable, and severe justice
to all. . . The Heratians, who never before en"joyed such security of life and property, offer up "many a fervent prayer that the Vizier may long "reign over them." The only pertinence of this information which is to put us to shame is that in the very same paragraph the Reviewer had described this model Vizier as a treacherous murderer and double-faced villain, false to England, and even to Persia, though he declared that his heart was with her.
The Reviewer's own story takes a much wider range, and, while he disclaims all pretension to eloquence, he modestly insists on his simple and significant facts. On the former point he has hardly done himself justice. The article is decidedly interestinig, which it would not be without sometbing like style. As to the latter point, while we admit the value and simplicity of the facts, yet they renmind us of an imaginary procession in a facetious contemporary, in which some are going one way, some the contrary way, and some no way at all. But we will take them, as the Reviewer wishes, at their value as facts. Facts speak for themselves; they need no adorning, and, as in this instance, they are not easily marshalled. Here are some of them, as stated in the article before us, and we leave the reader to cdraw his own inferences. Our negotiations with Persia and the neighbouring States for the last half-century have been selfish and dishonest. Under the dread of a French expedition to the East we made a treaty with Persia, and also with Cabul, on the schoolboy principle of "H Heads I " win, tails you lose," which those States had only to compare and reflect upon, and they would come, as they did, to a conclusion derogatory to our national character. This treaty was not even laid before Parliament. It pledged us to leave Persia and Affghanistan to fight out their own battles wvith one another, but to give a large annual subsidy to Persia, and mediate in her behalf in the event of invasion by any European Power. We broke both these pledges. When Russia several years after invaded Persia, and wrested some provinces from her, the SHAu appealed to this treaty; whereupon the Duke of WELLINGTON advised, that tlhough it was true Russia had seized and occupied the said provinces by force of arms, yet the first bloodshed was done by Persia in resisting that aggression; Persia was consequently the first actual aggressor, and had no claim to the subsidy, though she had to mediation. CAsNING thought the subsidy and the mediation wen4 together, and, having the Duke's opinion against the former, abstained from the latter. From this incident Persia and other Powers formed the meanest opinion of our national honour, which they have never yet got over, and probably never will. Since that we have attempted various impositions upon Persia with more or less success. We have attempted to establish there a species of embassy, really committing only the Indian Government, though assuming the dignity and authority of the Government at home. The Persians and Affghans alike never forget injuries,-their revenge is eternal. No professions, no actual benefits, will ever efface the memory of a wrong. The British Government-we are continuing our excerpta from the Reviewer's "facts,"-have sometimes, even in the matter of Herat, supported the claims of Persia, sometimes those of Affghanistan, according as it was our object to bribe or to bully the former, to distract or to consolidate the latter. The present expedition is part of the same policy as our occupation of Cabul near 20 years ago; and the precedent of that disastrous story is not to be avoided, but followed vwith caution and correction.
But the Reviewer's " facts" about Herat require a special enumeration. YAR MAHwmoa, as well as his predecessors, admitted the suzerainty of Persia. He coined money in the SHAH's name, paid him tribute, and offered a public form of prayer for him. His death was a great calamity to Herat and the East. The " convention " made on his death between Colonel S1IIEL, and the Persian Prime Minister was not strictly a " conven" tion" at all, but only an " agreement." It was the result of a long negotiation, in which the Colonel tried to cheat the Vizier by committing, Persia without committing England, and the Vizier tried to cheat the Colonel by committing England without committing Persia. So far as regards the letter of the document, the Colonel, in the opinion of the Reviewer, was entirely successful, and the result was a perfectly gratuitous engagement on the part of Persia to have nothing to do with Herat. This was certainly a diplomatic feat. Unfortunately Persia, notwithstanding a naturaly subtle intellect, could not be made to understand that she had been overreached, and stupidly maintained that the engagement was reciprocal. The ingenious Colonel, in the opinion and with the full approbation of the Reviewer, had achieved a further success of the same description. Even taking the " agreement" at its worst, it only bound the Colonel, and not his Government. In effect, however, the Colonel did not hold even himself bound by it, for he did not discontinue his intrigues with Herat, and was detected in them. The real object of these negotiations, thus frastrated by the inability of Persia to see that she had been cheated, was to alter the political relations of Herat, by attaching it absolutely and in all respects to the Affgban confederation and rule. Besides negotiation, so clever to so little purpose, our only hold upon Herat is an appeal to the fears of Persia by our naval expedition. We have already, by agreement with Persia, the maritime police of the Gulf, but
,we have yet to impreEs upon her our ascendancy on that element. The operation il to work morally; that is, simply as a diversion or menace, with no direct strategic bearings upon Herat or the military operations of Persia; and when the expedition is over the only result is to be a certain impression upon the mind of Persia, to work with or against certain other impressions generally unfavourable to us. This moral reullt on her nervous system, and her consequent withdrawal for a time from open interference in the affairs of Herat, ae -worth an expedition the mere cost of which must have the effect of suspending all public works in unfortunate India for we know not how long.
We add, still on the authority of the Reviewer, some facts on the other questions at issue. One of that very troublesome clas, a naturalized British subject with a long oriental name, having an influential Persian tenant who would neither pay rent for a house nor give up possession, the British Minister took the law into his own hands, and sent a posse of dependents to eject the Persian. Hereupon the SuDDR Auit sent another posse to the defence of his countryman, and there ensued the usual amount of violence, insult, and recrimination; the proeedings of the English appearing, no doubt, very abrupt, and the metaphorical language of the Orientals anything but flattering to our national pride. Considering how recently we
have had to refer an Ausrian Field-marshal to tribumals where we could not but be aware he would have small chance of redress, we must say that the English Minister in this instance did not act up to the theory of our own law, whatever may be the law of the Persiana. As to the " Mrs. HAsnmr affair," the Reviewer is not very full of facts, but he does state that our Minister claimed and attempted to carry out the right of appointing a man to a consulate, or British agency of a similar description, in the very teeth of the Persian Government. These are stated as mere instances of the feeling that had risen up between the twoGovemments-afeelingwhichtheReviewerstates to be of long duration, tobe justified by the conduct of England, to be too deeply seated to be softened even by fair and generous treatment, to be quite certain not to be extinguished by harsh measures, and yet to be very injurious to our interests in the East. Such are some of the facts on which the Edinburgh Reviewver defends an attack upon Persia by sea and by land, the capture of her islands, the bombardment of her forts, and the arming of her neighbours and rivals against her.
Another word for ourselves. We have been accused of throwing a fictitious cloud about this Herat and its political relations; and the Edinburgh Reviewer triumphantly appeals to General FEr,mxi and his host of sponsors. But how comes there to be need of an appeal to an unpublished MS. by an ex-officer in the Chasseurs d'Afrique, and to such dealers in recondite subjects as Sir HExNY RAwLxrsoN ? We shaU next be referred to the Nineveh marble and inscriptions in cuneiform letters. But, so far from the General testifying to the notoriety of these affairs, he expressly asserts that-the British Governmenat has for a long period studiously kept the world in the dark upon them, and prevented inquiry into those regions. The Reviewer contradicts him, and refers to an article some time back in a Calcutta review, which nobody read, because, as the Indian papers said, the subject had lost its interest since the Affghan war. But the General throws no new light on the politics of Herat.. Eren if he had done so, his authority on such a point is effectually disposed of by the Reviewer himself. The General enters Affghanistan, and converses with the authorities of Furrah and other cities. He undoubtingly assumes, and quotes their undoubting assumptions, that the British took a substantial possession of Cabul. He discusses the mixed feelings we left behind us-the indignation of the higher classes at our ambition and double-dealing, and the gratitude felt by all for our reforms. We displaced corrupt authorities, enforced justice, undertook roads and public works, and made the people prosperous. So far the General and his four illustrious sponsors give their silent concurrence. But it is a great blunder, interposes the Reviewer, to suppose that we took possession of Cabul. England only made it a friendly Power, and had no intention of making it otherwise. We leave theGeneral, his Editors, and his Reviewer, to settle this delicate question among them. Biut here is a man, according to the Reviewer, who lived some time in a country recently occupied by our amies, talked with all classes about us, and came away under a gross delusion as to the political relations and ownership of the country during the period he had been talking of. Such is the close obser , careful listener, and accurate discriminator ivw(
MS. has been foraged up by a comp-Liy o. linguists and antiquaries, to determine, uztce for all, the relations of the " contcntionz ity" of Herat, as the Reviewer cals it. But, be his authority as worthless as the Reviewer makes it out to be, it matters nothing; for, after all, he says hli rdly a word on the subject.
The world will by this time think it has had
The world will by this time think it has had enough of the Glasgow University and its annual choice of a Lord Rector. It is said of Prussian officials that there are two things which no man of them can hope to escape-death and the third class of the Red Eagle. The two inevitable events in the career of a British literary or political lon are, similarly, his latter end and his election to the Rectorship of the University of Glasgow. The thing has lately become the terror of soberminded celebrities. Annually, about November, leaders of parties, authors of histories, poets, and philanthropists are in a nervous state; for " Natio " Rothseyana" and " Natio Glottiana " are on the alert. If a man have written a tragedy, put together the bones of a moa, or made a brilliant speech on the war, let him beware; he may be suddenly informed by an extract from the local newspaper thatheisthe subjectof adesperate contest. Party spirit is running high on the banks of the Clyde in his favour, or in favour of his opponent, a brillant nobleman who made a speech last year vindicating the supremacy of Scotchmen over the universe. It is useless to resist. The Glasgow organs of opinion have already announced that the struggle will be most severe, that if the noble Lord wins the suffrages of the alumni of our venerable seat of learming, the Professor his opponent will at least carry back into his retirement the admiration of a large ninority, and may count on their fixed intention to propose him again next year, with the fullest certainty of success. So the unfortunate at length yields. If he can be beaten, he is at least safe for a twelvemonth, during which time he may save himself by doing something unpopular. But if he be elected there is no alternative. He must prepare for the " installation," at which ceremony he will be attended by the Venerable Principal MACFARLAX, the several Professors, and, of course, Sir ARcalHALD ALisoN. A speech of two hours on Scotland, her intellectual and moral greatness generally, and Bunxs, WTrr, and WATER ScoTr in particular, then follows by immemorial usage.
We cannot but be satisfied that the task of saying nothing in many vords has this year fallen to Sir E. BULwER LYTToN, for no man, perhaps, is capable of performing it with greater skill. Indeed, we wish that the Glasgow students would always elect a celebrity of this class. There is no doubt that a genius of the phosphoric kind is fittest for the purpose. Sir E. B. LYTToN can talk about all literatures and aU languages,-classical antiquity of course; then French history-the age of Louis XIV., VOLTAIRE and Roussau, the merits of literature under the Republic and under the Empire. He has a speaking acquaintance with the German philosophers, KAiNT, and FicHTE, and SCHELUNG, which, of course, is impressive, and can tell us a good deal about the True, the Beautiful, and the Good. Then his language has the regular allegorical swell. The flash of his simulitudes and the twirl of his metaphors continually keep attention alive. If you cease to listen for a moment you are lost, for the xpeaker will have gone from " the ribald builders of the " atheistical Babel of the last century" back to the " lawrs for the government of commonwealths, "which PLATO had obscured, and even ARuSTOTLE "had left undefined," or from the " gigantic " GoYnTH" to " the city of the violet crown and "the Roman Capitol." The tremendous cheering with which the new Lord Rector was greeted at the conclusion of his address shows the enthusiasm which his eloquence excited; and we may own that he made a good speech; for there was little to say, and yet Sir E. LyrToN spoke what fills some three columns of newspaper space.
The fact is, that orations of this kind must
naturally be empty and rhetorical. The speaker labours under the same disadvantages as the preacher or the moral essayist. Nothing has happened since last Sunday or last year, and human nature is the same as in the days of the Patriarchs. Therefore the basis of the sermon, essay, or lecture must be the same, with only a difference of treatment. The most florid colourist is consequently the most successful artist. Take the Lord Rector on the present occasion. Even the meritq of Glasgow form a finite subject, and everything that can be said has been said on that great theme. Unless Sir EDwAsD 'wishes merely to copy his "illus" trious predecessors," he must launch out into generalities. Therefore, 4 propos of nothing but the memory of DIGALD STEWART, we have a violent attack on the philosophy of Co-DoRCET and the raillery of VOLTAIRB. The tundergraduates whom "Scotland rears and sends "forth with her lion at. their hearts and "her white cross of ST. ANDREW on their "shields" are requested to look back and see what " their Scottish fathers have done to "snatch the firebrand from the hands of those "drunkards of knowledge who, reeling here and "there amid palaces and temples, fancied that "they illumined society by the conflagration of its "fabrics." " That brand," continues the orator, "your fathers snatched, not to extinguish its "living flame-no, but to place it aloft and calm "upon stately watchtowers, a guiiding light, and "not a consuming fire." We can wel fancy the cheers which succeeded this beautiful passage, and the waving of handkerchiefs from that confiding sex which never withholds its adreiratioji from anything that is unintelligible.
Having kiMled once more the thousand-timesslain beroes of the nyclqopcedia, the Lord Rector turns to Scotland, and the usual tribute is paid to departed Scottish worthies. The next subject is one as well worn as the invectives on French philosophy. Sir E. B. LYTToN supports the claimn of Greek and Latin to be useful parts of a liberal education. There are masterpieces of composition among the productions of the Greeks and Romans. Our language is derived in a great measure from theirs. Many persons who have learnt Greek and Latin have declared in after days their satisfaction, and acknowledged that their time was not lost. Many, on the contrary, who have neglected those branches of knowledge have regretted it. It is better to read the classics than VOLTAIRE, who would make us infidels, or BossuBT and Bo)RDALouE,who might convert us intoPapists. AnRosTo and BOCCACCIO are not good elementary moralists, and the German writers are very little better. Therefore we must keep to the classics. The usual good advice about perseverance, and always conforming to the standard of morality, rmakes up the rest of the address.
It is difficult to judge the merits of a man without knowing the circumstances in which he is placed. If Sir E. LmTTow was told, as he may have been, to avoid every subject on which a difference of opinion might arise, he perhaps did as well as he could in confining himself to commonplace moral and philosophical reflections, dressed up in fme language. But a Lord Rector, if we am- to .Adge by his name, is one who is honoured aud one who rules. Surely, then, he iii:- take advantage of his position to give some Pr +iPca1 advice to the University in the only - .Gon which he may deliver during his brief term of office. There are, we presume, deficiencies in Scotch Universities as well as elsewhere, and yet, while Oxford and Cambridge are politely compared to Augean stables, an educated gentleman will talkforhours atGlasgowwithout utteringaword except of undiscriminating and exaggerated praise. The best friends of education in Scotland are just now lamenting the shortcomings of the principal seats of leatring, and the inferiority of training which the examinations for the differentsenriceshave recently made manifest. The subject has been lately discussed by a Scotch Professor, who certainly cannot be accused of any want of patriotism. Yet, whisle Sir EDWAAD is expatiating on French unbelief and German rationalism, he has not a word for practical evils which are at his very door. We trust that future Lord Rectors will confine themselves to more moderate flights and more useful themes, or the annual speech will degenerate more and more into a mere display of tumid and pretentious rhetoric.
The most popular subject of the day appears
The most popular subject of the day appears In one sense to be the Income-tax. We certainly do not mean that people are fond of paying it, or of contemplating the said payment, or of filling up their returns, or of performing any other of the little duties by which such contributions to the revenue are attended; but they are manifestly fond of talking about it, and are meeting for the express purpose of holding such conversations all over the country. We shall be doing them good service, therefore, by putting at their disposal some of those facts and figures out of which speeches cau be built, and by furnishing them with the very latest authentic evidence on a question so generally interesting. To this end we avail ourselves of a return moved for by Mr. MOFFAT, and ordered by the House of Commons in June last, which in the compass of half-a-dozen pages gives us the results of some highly serviceable computations. The particular year, be it observed, for which the return is made is that ending on the 5th day of April, 1855.
In that year the net amount of Property and Income Tax assessed under the several schedules A, B, 0, D, and E, was, in the aggregate for England and Wales, 12,086,5221.; for Scotland, 1,140,7301.; and for Ireland, 1,130,8381. Taking the case of England and Wales again, for more particular discrimination, we find that the several contributions to the total amount were, under schedule A, 5,365,9481.; under schedule B, 692,8621.; under C, 1,446,4941.; under D, 3,851,0221.; and under E, 730,1961. These are the principal totals. We will now takle the particular schedule D, and present its operation over the whole of Great Britain from different points of view.
The largest number of contributors in any one class is to be found in that constituted by incomes amounting to 1001., but falling short of 1501. annually. In point of fact, out of 261,662 persons representingthe entire numberof contributors under this scliedule, the class, in question comprises no fewer than 119,782, or something approaching to one-half of the whole. This numerical ascendancy is still discernible in the same class, though with far diminished proportions, when we turn to the amount of tax actually paid. As we are now considering not merely England and Wales, but Great Britain altogether, we must add to the total of 3,851,0221. given above the sum of 386,1331. for Scotland, which will give a gross total of 4,237,1551. Of this the incomes between 1001. and 1501. furnish 561,0401., and if, after interposing a class with incomes between 1501. and 2001., we construct, as in the return before us, a rising sale by successive additions of 1001. at a time from 2001. up to 1,0001. ; of 1,0001. at - time from that to 5,0001., and from three more classes out of the incomes between 5,0001. and 10,0001.; 10,0001. and 50,0001. ; and 50,0001. and upwards; respectively it will be found that there is no one class which contributes quite so much as that first mentioned. It is to be observed, however, that the -difference is not very large, nor, indeed, at all compmarble to that
existing between the number of contributors under this head and under others. For instance, whereas this 561,0401. is produced by the deposits of 119,782 taxpayers, we find that 457,5121. is yielded by a class numbering only 445,-viz., that blessed with incomes between 10,0001. and 50,0001. a-year. The contributors, again, possessing between 2001. and 3001., though only 32,973 in number, provide the revenue with 425,6431.
It may be remarked that, with the exception of the item last mentioned, the amounts received from the several contributing classes decrease gradually tiU we arrive at the mark indicating an income of 1,0001. a-year; and that immediately after this, which shows the lowest point of production, they take a prodigious spring, and again sink gradually until the sphere exposed to the incidence of the tax is extended once more. For convenience' sake we will consider the incomes under 1501., 2001., 3001., and so on up to 1,0001., represented respectively by classes numbered from 1 to 10. Of these the first contribuites, as we have said, 561,0401.; the second, 383,8411. ; the third, 425,6431.; the fourth, 282,6291. ; the fifth, 179,5101.; the sixth, 164,0791. ; the seventh, 113,5601.; the eighth, 88,9071.; the ninth, 82,0601. ; and the tenth, or that with incomes between 9001. and 1,0001. a-year, only 43,4321. In fact, if we are to credit the figures before us, the entire number of persons in Great Britain enjoying receipts of this kind to the amount last mentioned is only 798.
The jump made from this very point is very striing, though of course due to the fact that the class becomes much more comprehensive when the scale ascends by thousands instead of hundreds. But whereas the contributors possessing between 9001. and 1,0001. a-year were, as we have said, only 798, those possessing between 1,0001. and 2,0001. a-year were no fewer than 5,324; while the product of the tax, instead of being 43,4321., is 405,4311. After this we come to intomes between 2,0001. and 3,0001., which yield 206,2621., those between 3,0001. and 4,0001. gvinng 156,9721., and those between 4,0001. and 5,0001. furnishing a quota of 115,9241. Here the scale again clears a wider space in its ascent, rising at one bound from 5,0001. to 10,0001., and again, therefore, the contributions of the class indicated take a corresponding spring, becoming 301,2661., -while the number of contributors under this head is 773 as against 466 under the former. To this gradual developement, however, there is a limit, and it has now been reached. People cannot make incomes of infinite magnitude, even in Great Britain, and, notwithstanding the class next on the list includes every shade of income between 10,0001. and 50,0001. a-year, it numbers only 445 persons, though the productiveness of the individuals raises the result to 457,5121., as observed at the outset of our remarks. Still more signal are the figures in the last class of all. In this category is to be comprised every imaginable amount of incorne beyond 50,0001. a-year, and including that respectable sum itself. But, alas I we can no longer reckon by hundreds, and perhaps, indeed, the reader's anticipations will he pretty well satisfied when we tell him that the possessors of this kind of revenue are as many as 41.
So r;uch for Great Britain; and we will now add a very brief sketch of the results in the case of Ireland. Here the net amount of Property and Income Tax assessed was 693,7071. under schedule A; 54,2381. under B; 81,1051. under C; 251,6701. under D; and 50,1181. under E; on which figures we will only remark that D does not bear such a proportion to A as in the case of Great Britain. In the working of schedule D, however, we find the same kind of results, with the distinction of greatly diminished amounts. The largest item, for example, is still that denoting incomes between 1001. and 1501., and similar augmentations take place when the class of incomes is expanded by hundreds instead of fifties, anrd by thousands instead of hundreds. The first class, reckoning according to the notation adopted above, yields 39,4341. (the number of contributors being 8,063) ; the second, 23,4771. ; and the third (2001. to 3001.), 31,4881. From this point the decrease commences and continues as in the instance of Great Britain, with one rather singular exception, uptothetenth class, withincomes under 1,0001. The exception is that the possessors of incomes between 8001. and 9001. a-year are as numerous, within one, as those enjoying between 7001. and 8001. (126 against 127), and therefore yield a larger product,-viz., 6,1201., instead of 5,4171. After this, however, the figures proceed as before. The number of contributors with from 9001. to 1,0001. was only 52; when the class is extended to embrace incomes between 1,0001. and 2,0001. it becomes 352. Similarly, whenthe bound is made from thousands to five thousands, the taxpayers of the enlarged class become 29 in number, in place of 23 constituting the last of the classes ascending by 1,0001. only, and drop again to 19, notwithstanding the scope provided between 10,0001. and 50,0001. Of incomes exceeding 50,0001. no example is given. Such are some of the particulars attending the operation of schedule D; whether they will render it more agreeable of aspect is more than we have now space to consider.

SINGULAR ACCIDENT.-ColoeielWyua.3fr 's hounds met on Saturday ldst at the Wbitewayslodge (one of the eutranoes to .Arundel.paLrk). It was an off-day, but nevertheless there was a good field, and the weathor was just adapted for foxhunting, as the scent was likely to lie well. The huntsman next proceeded to draw the tewell-wood. In a few minutes a fox was started. This was on the outside of the park waaUs. Away went th' hounds in full cry down by the Whiteways, skirting the wall of the park towards Houghton village. It was snpposed by many that this was an "ola fox," andthathe made wayfor theriver, whiclhrunsim. mediately beneath, and where he wouldliave stooa some chance to escape. Missing his track, however, he ran in the direction of Houghton Chalk-pit, a precipice about 150 feet high. Away they all went, full cry- the danger was seen, but the sport was at its height, a&n it was imnpossible to call the hounds off. The fox reached the brink of the precinice and dashed over, falling to the bottom, being smuhed to atomsL Away went several of the hounds helter-skelter in the same manner. Four of the hounds were kiUed by the fall, and six wounded. Luckily, none of the borsomen foHowed, or death would hbve been certain. To illustrate tho great love the hounds bays for this sport it may be mentioned tbat one of the wonnded animals, just able to crawl, absolutely hobbled along to get at the fox. Among the hounds kliled was one of Colonel Wyndharn's old favouritos, which was much prized by the gallant coloneL Indeed, it is said that the whipper-in was absolutely moved to tears at the fearful havoc made in his paok, and more particularly at the death of his old favourite

A Crimean Banquet At Paris.
A CRIMEAN BANQUBT AT PARTS.
The Moniteur of yesterday publishes the following account of a banquet given at the Palais Royal by Prince Napoleon, on the 14th inst., to those General officers actually at Paris who took part in the war in the East -
Anong the guests were Admiral Hamelin, the Duke of Malakhoff, Marshal Canrobert, Miarshal Bosquet, Generals Regnaud de Saint Jean d'Angely, De Salles, Niel, De MaoNfahon, Thiiry, Dalesme. There were 52 guests present.
Prince Napoleon had asked Prince Jerome to preside at this military assembly, among whom were nine officers of the first Empire, nearly all of them Waterloo men.
At dessert His Imperial Highness Prince Jerome rose and proposed the following toast *-
" To the Elmpror. to the Empress, and to the Prince Imperial I to whom Ish for the welfare of our beloved country which he is caUed upon to goveni, the courae, the wisdomn, andl clevernes of his august father. The health of the Emperor !"
His Imperial Highness Prince 1;apoleon then rose andl said :
" Gentlemen, I propose the health of the Commanders-inChief of the army in the Crimea-of those men of arms who have had the glory of adding new victories to our military annals-of Marshal St. Arnaud, that bold soldier, who died after the Alma, baving for a wvinding-sheet the tricolour flag of regenerated France-of Marshal Canrobert who knew how to keep up the army under most difficult circumstances, and handed over to his successor, as he himself expressed it, an army hardened by war and ready for any enterprise-of Marshal Pelisier, Duke of MIalakhoff, who has immortalized himself by the capture of Sebastopol, and kn-ew how, by his persevering energy, to triumph over difficulties and obstacles which surrounded him on al sides. Allow me, gentlemen, to recall with a sad emotion our brothers in armR who have died like worthy sons of France. The bitter regret we feel at their loss is lessened only by the results that have been obtained. I do not wish to talk politics at this meeting of comrades of tho battleofield. I only wish to recaU the military rasults of the war. They are great, because the Present army has shonv itself worthy of our fathers; the glorious traditions of the Republic and of the first Empire have been renewed by you. Posterity will say that at Mooscow our fathers vanquished the Russians, but were compelled to give in to the elements; while at
Sebastopol you have overcomne the elements, And van quished the Russians. In history 1854 will respond to 1812 I The immense advantage of the war, I say it with pide,is th;tyou have proved that France till has her
T'he Marshal Duke of Malakhoff replied as followsa-
*'M onseignenr, it is for me to reply to the toast which your Imperial Highness has just given to the army in the Cnmea, and to thank you for having Assembled us around the brother of the Emperor Napoleon I., the most iUustrious of the last representatives of his immortal time; his presence here reminds us that the army of wbich.your Imperial Highness has just praised the prowoss has nobly folowed the great examples begneathed by its predecessors. The praises w ich your Impenal Highness has bestowed upon the army which I had the honour of commanding will be the more appreciated by it becanse it remembers with happiness that yonr Imperial Highness shared its labours anid contributed valiantly to its first successes. Your Imperial Highness responded to the thoughts of us all by reamlling in this allusion to glorious remembrances the companions in Arms that we have lost, and I thank you for having honoured their memory by associating them so nobly with our regrets. I propose, 31onseigneur, your health and that of his Imperial Highness Prince Jerome Napoleon."
His Imperial Highness Prince Jerome re3ponded as follows -
' I thank Marshal Pelissier forhaving associated snyname with the remembrance of the Grand Army. I am hbappy to be able to respond to it by proposing a toast to our brave army and navy, and especially to our glorious army of tho Crimea, which, with the rapidity of the eagle, seized upon eJtof placing itself worthily by the side of sidxes of arengo, Austerlitz, and Jena. The Hlealth of the Army and Navy of the Crimea!"
The last toast wfas proposed by MNIarshal Canrobert. Hle said:
"Monseigneur,-Called upon as a former General-inChief of the army of the East to respond to a toast given by your Imperial Highne to that army, I beg of you to allow me to commence by paying here ajust tribute of praise and regret to my iUustrious predecessor, Marshal St. Arnaud, who, falling enshrouded, as it were, in his triumph of the Alma, was happy enough to makc known to the world the glorious part which yorr Imporial Highness took in that deed of arms. Allow me, also, Monseigneur, to call to mind here the roble support which you gave to all the severe arddanzerous Isbours at the comnienoement of the siege of Sebastopol; and allow him 'who hbd the honour of being your second General-in-Chief to mention here that on the 16;h of October, when the assaulting columns were preparing for the attack of the morrow upon the town, if the expected result of the doublo fire by land and sea should render the assar'tnecessary, your Imperial Highness insisted upon having the honour of leading them. At a later period, Monseigneur, when a cruel illness compelled you to leave the army, yonr Imperial Highmess never ceased to show that you were always present there in your heart, and, availing yourself of your exalted position, you succeeded in relieving the victims of war, over whom you never ceased to watch. I thank you, then, Monseigneur, in the name of the army of the East, whose Generals, my glorious and dear companions in arms, assembled by your Imperial EIighness roumd your august father, will heartily join with me in. proposing, with the health of the Emperor, that of your Ymperial gighness."
The recent sourmeirs of the war kept up the conviviality of this family fete, destined to strengthen the bonds of fraternity which unite the commanders as well as the mcen of the army.

[A portion of the following appeared In our second edi. tion of yesterday:-1
(EROM OUR OWN CORBESPONDENT.)
PARIS, TIIURSDAY, JA?e. 15, 6 P.m.
A. telegraphic deapatch from Berne, dated at halfpast 11 o'clock this morning, announces that the National Council had adopted the propositions of the Federal Govermment, on the motives put forth by -the Commission, by a majority of 91 votes against 4. 'One member abstained from voting. The Council -of States had not voted when the despatch left. The -following are the grounds on which the propositions -sre accepted:
"Inasmuch as, according to the coimnunications made, -the independence of the Canton of Neuchbtel appears gua. -ranteed, Switzerland is disposed to contribate to the main. tenance of peace as far as her honour and her independence permit.,,
I enclose the first part of the message which the Federal Council has addressed to the Assembly. It comprises the propositions which Colonel Barmaun and Dr. Kern brought from Berne to Paris, and the reply of M. Walewski, bearing date the 5th of January. You are already aware that the Commis'66n of the National Council, composed of 11 mem-
'bers, and the Commission of the Council of States, of nine, held their first sitting on the 13th, and, after having exanmined the documents submitted to them by the Government, they took into consideration -the report of Dr. Kern on the result of his mission to Paris. Some difference of opinion arose, but at the next meeting of the Commissioners, held in the
afternoon, and the Commission of the National a -nuncil (.as I mentioned yesterday), it was decided 'unanimously, less one, in tfie affirmative.
It is remaarked that the majority of the Swiss press for some days past does not seem to approve the policy of the Government, as hitherto; and some mistrust, and even discontent, is manifested as to -the nature and extent of the concessions made by the Federal Council. The Suisse, a Conservative journal, says :_
"It seems to us that the chapter of honourable concessions is very near being exhausted. For the last three aonths the Swiss people have been accustomed to dignified language, and they would not easily accept any other. They tave been disturbed from their pursuits by the common danger, and 35,000 men are on the frontier. Is it at such a moment-is it under such auspices-that there can be a question of preferring to honour the deceitful repose of a falling people? Let the Federal Assembly derive inspiration from its vote of the 23d of September, and, above all, from that of the 28th of December."
The public, perhaps, do not knowtaUtheguarantees -that the Federal Council msay have in its possession. It is more than probable that the Emperor Napoleon has received in private the assurance that the King -of Prmssia will formally renounce his claim on :Neuch&tel after the liberation of the prisoners.
The delay of five days granted to Verger, by virtue of the 296th article of the Code of Criminal Instruction, to appeal against the decree of the (Chambre des Aises en Acusation (tantamount to our grand jury) expired yesterday. At 2 o'clock Verger -called for the Registrar, and announced to him that he intended to appeal, and he signed his appeal. 'The Court of Cassation heard the appeal to-day, and -decided against it. The trial will consequently take place on Saturday next.
The Minister of Finance published in the AMonisevr of this morning a statement of the comparative receipts of the indirect taxes for the year 1856 with those of the years 1854 aud 1855. From these re-turns it appears that the amount of those taxes for the last year was 126,000,000f., being an increase as -compared with 1854 of 178,000,000f., and as compared with 1855 of 75,000,000f. The increase has been on the Excise, the stamps on mortgages, and the duties on home-made sugar and tobacco.
* When Feruk Khan, the Persian Ambassador, put into Toulon he remained there nearly two days. He was received with great honour, and on hislanding a salute was fired from the forts and the Bretagne, the admiral's flagship, and on his visiting the Bretagne the following day he was greeted with a salute of 17 guns. The Ambassador exprssed his admiration and astonishment at the arsenal, and the immense naval resources which it contained. Feruk Khan is charged to present to the Emperor Napoleon a portrait of the l;hah surrounded with diamonds, and four Turcoman horses, to the Empress a rich pearl necklace, and to the Prince Imperial a sword long preserved in Persia as a Mussullman relic.
A letter from Constantinople, in the Cousrrier de Marseies, says:-
11 We learn from Trebizonde that the Circassians have recommenced their national struggle against the Russians with great ardour. About the beginning of last month the son of Emin Sefer Pasha, at the head of a strong party of Circassians, and supported by three other columns under Hussein Effendi, Suleyman Effendi, and Saleyman Effendi Ben Halan, met a body of 10,000 Russians who ihad sacked and burnt the village of Tarta Kariksi, on the banks of tho Sof, and drove them back after a bloody battle, In which the Russians left 700 dead on the field. On the 13th the Serdar Kaflan of the army of the Emir Naib Mo. hammed, Emin Pasha, fell upon 150 Cossacks who were -scorting a convoy of provisions to the new fort of Zaba put them to the sword, and captured the convoy. We further learn that the troops of Sefer Pasha have laid waste the territory of Tavapshia, suspected of a secret understand. ing with the enemy.",

VIENNA, JAN. 13.
According to an official despatch which has this nornin g been received from Verona, a full amnesty has been g,ranted by the Emperor to 32 persons -who were concerned in the Mantua conspiracy. At the tine (some four years ago) it was rumoured that the plan of the conspirators was to obtain possession of the fortress, but no one who knows the size and strength of Mantua can possibly believe that any men in their senses could form such a project. Many of the persons arrested belonged to the higher classes of society, and among the rest was a dignitary of theRoman CatholicOhurch. Itwas here said that the person in question was a bishop, but it is possible that he was of less elevated rank. Everything which the Emperor has said and done -since he has been in Italy has given satisfaction to -the people, with the sole exception of his reply to -the address of the Patriarch of Venice. - In general, the conduct of the Romani Catholic clergy in the lombardo-Venetian provinces is not calculated to
InspIre either respet or esteem, and it is strongly saspected that the great majority of the AustroItalian prelates would not mcruple to sacrifice the intereat and welfare of Austria to the interests and -welfare of Rome. It is very generally stated that
soveral of the first families in Venice and Lombardy -are to be elevated to the rank of Austrian Princes,
sand among other names those of Litta, Scotti, Borromeo, Melzi, and Archinto are mentioned. A furtlier amnesty wi be granted while their Majesties at4 at Miln, and it is believed that, while the -three M Iinisters are there, the resignation of Count Radetzky will be formally accepted. The thanks of the Emperor will be publicly given to the venerable
arsha, who wol, in all probability, receive some m ore substantial mark of his Sovereign's gratitude. As has been said, the Archduke Ferdinand Max is to be Governor-General of the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom, with powers a full as those recently

ieneral of Hungary.
Some more detailed information has been reeeved of the doingts at Padua during the stay -of their Majesties in that ancient city. In general the streets of Padusanre as empty as those of Oxford or Cambridge duig the long vacation, but
they were well filled as long as the Court was present. Padua, with a population of abont 40,000 souls, covers nearly as much ground as Milan, but such exertions had been made by the Imperial and municipal authorities that the old-fashioned dilapidated houses looked many years younger than they had done a couple of months before. The balconies of the palaces were hung with rich carpeting and ornamented with flowers and flags, and even the windows of the houses inhabited by the inferior classes were decorated with white and red or white and blue stripes of muslin or linen. As great numbers of country people had driven to the city to see their Majesties, some vehicles were seen which strongly contrasted with the elegant equipages in which the Court drove from the railroad. 'The Emperor and Empress were in an open carriage, which at first passed through a double hedge of soldiers, but wvhen their ajesties had entered the city gate the troops were withdrawn, and the people formed the escort of the Imperial travellers to the Palace Papafava. Although the Rvrivas were uttered with aU the force of which Italian lungs are capable, neither the Emperor nor the Empress seemed at all disconcerted by the deafening sounds. On his arrival at the Palace Papafava the Emperor mounted a horse which was in readiness for him, and rode out to the Prado della Valle, where he reviewed the garrison, which consists of six companies of infantry of the line, six companies of the Emperor's Cbasseurs,* two divisions of the Emperor's fussars, and one battery. As the crowd went out to see the parade it was almost impossible to keep the ground clear, but fortunately no accident happened. After the parade, the Emperor, accompanied by the people, went to the Palace inhabited by the Delegate, and on his return he was escorted by the same selfappointed body-guard. At 8 o'clock their Majesties drove m an open carriage through the densely-crowded streets, and the acclamations were, if possible, even louder than they had been in the morning. At 9 the Emperor and Empress went to the theatre, where, as a matter of course, they were well received, as the audience was almost exclusively composed of persons in the service of the State. On the 4th the Carroussel, of which slight mention has before been made, was ridden by some of the officers of the first division of the Emperor's regiment of Hussars. The modern tournament commenced with a quadrille ridden by 16 officers mounted on Arabian, English, and Hungarian horses. The next proof of skill given by the JIussars was, that they rode at full gallop close up to the estrade on which their Majesties were seated, and brought their steeds to a sudden stand without any apparent effort. I have repeatedly seen the present Emperor, when still a mere boy, do the same thing. The third division of the Carroussel consisted of sabre exercise, and information has reached me that some slight accidents happened. After having notched their sabres to their hearts' content, the 24 gallant warriors retired, after leaping over a high bar which had been placed across the lists. We are assured by the official correspondents that the Carrouissel was "perfectly successful," but it is here whispered that more than one of the riders lost his saddle. While the Emperor was at Venice he received more than 2,000 petitions, and many of them were thrust into his own hands as he entered or left the public establishments. The Yolk8freund relates that His Mlajesty was once separated from his suite by a crowd of women, each of whom was armed with a petition. The women, after having lissed the Emperor's legs, sabre, and coat, began to talk at one and the same time, which "intemezzo " gave His Majesty an opportunity of conveying to his pockets the mass of papers that had been placed in his hands. The whole thing seemed greatly to amuse the Emperor, but certain persons here highly disapprove "suchfamiliarity." The last news from Italy is that the Imperial travellers reached B3rescia on the 11th.
News which has been received direct from Naples fully confirms the report of your correspondent in that city. The army is extremely indignant that it has been placed under the surveillance of a special police, and the discontent felt is becoming greater from day to day. It must be well understood that the Neapolitan system of government is only hateful to the higher and middle classes. The lower classes are perfectly well content with their lot, and I have the very best authority for stating that the Lazzaroni consider King Ferdinand II. a model sovereign.
From aliasch we learn that the soldiers raised in Poland during the last conscription but one are to be sent at once to the Caucasus. It is believed that they are to reinforce the Russian army hich is on the frontiers of Persia.

BERLIN, JAN. 14.
Although German union has become a byword nearly synonymous with disunion,-the same as a Polish Diet has become synonymaous with disorder and party violence, there aDpears to be some chance that, at least in the province of material interests, such as commerce, navigation, coinage, &c., something like concord, if not unity, is in the way of attainment. Towards the close of last year a new code of commercial law, including maritime law as connected with trade, was elaborated here by a number of picked jurists, assisted by men practically acquainted with the working and defects of the present existing law. The result of their labours is about to be made the basis for the deliberations of a congress of deputies from all the various States of the German Confederation, which is to meet to-morrow for the first time at Nuremberg. This congress, or conference, or committee comes together in pursuance of a Federal resolution passed at Frankfort on the 18th of December of last year; but as in Germany surprising rapidity is an incident which very seldom characterizes any process, so it must not be supoosed that this resolution was the work of a single sitting. On the contrary, a motion had been made at Frankfort in the early part of the year by the Bavarian Government for the appointment of a committee to draw up a new commercial code for all Germany, and to invite the Governments of the different Federal States to express within six weeks their willingness or unwillingness to depute men of law and commerce to take part in their deliberations. The motion having sa usual been referred to a committee to report upon, a resolution was passed in conformity with the terms of the motion. Since then all the Federal States have expressed their willingness to co-operate in the work, and the Prussian Government having in the meantime brought its labours on the commercial code to a conclusion, the Federal Assembly resolved on December 18 to convoke the chosen men of all the States to meet in Nuremberg on the 15th inst. Two very great deviations from the usual practice with regard to Federal business have been introduced into the arrangements of this commission, and doubtless they will turn out to be of the greatest possible advantage to its labours :-lst, to let its resolutions be determined by a simple majority of votes; and 2d, to have the members of the Committee so thoroughly instructed and empowered by their Governments as to enable them to give their votes on every subject without previous reference home. The result of their labours is to be laid before the Federal Diet itself as soen- as concluded;
it remams to be seen whether that body retains
vitality enough to come to a resolution on the subject within any moderate time. It is now 41 years since, at the Conference of Vienna, the necessity for an universal code of commerce for 'all Germany was so fully recognied as to lead the representatives of that 33-headed nation to " propose to themsel ves at t1e jirst meeting of the Federal Diet in
Frankfort to enter nto deliberations about commerce and the traffic between the various States, as well a . navigation, in conformity to theprinciples laiddownat the Congress of Vienna." It was Prussia that first
had the merit of establishing a commercial and fiscal union of any extent in Germany (the present Zoll
verein), and it is Prussia again which furnishes the materials for the deliberations of the other Statea of the Confederation. To this present committee in Nuremberg Prussia will depute a jurist of eminence in the employ of the Government, who wil be assisted by two experienced merhants-one from the eastern and the other from the western portion of the monarchy, inasmuch as the laws and practices of the two portions are different.
In another point on which German union was beginning to improve its character, viz., coinage, by the labours of the Committee still sitting in Vienna,
§ The regimeX calledl'Kaiseager,"which is recraited in the Tyrol, is tbe fine,s boy of troops in the Austriin sernce.
the Grand Duchy of Heme Darmntadt is determined to put a spoke in the wheel. This Coinage Comrittee had arrived at certain very wholesome monetary regulations, one of which was, that no State should be at liberty to issue paper money representing any other coinage than was current in its own territories. The Darmstadt Bank, however, was founded lately with a view almost exclusively to circulating its paper in Prussia; now the Prussian coinage consists of thalers and that of Hesse larmstadt of gulden, and therefore the managers of the Darmstadt Bank have prevailed on the Government not to accede to this resolution, which would almost immediately compel them to close their doors and shut up shop.
At KEnigsberg, lately, there was to be a lecture delivered upon the steam engine, before an audience of admiring mechanics; as usual, there was a policeman present to ascertain that no political sentiments were expressed. The lecturer commenced an eloquent speech, to the effect that no conqueror of ancient or modern times, neither Alexander the Great, nor Julius COesar, nor Napoleon, was so great a conqueror as James Watt. So far had he got with his lecture when the policeman came down on him with one fell swoop, and put a stop to the evening's entertainment, declaring that his duty did not admit of his any further permitting this political discourse!

ALEXANDRIA, JAN. 5.
The Peninsular and Orienta l Company's steamers Vectis from Marseilles, and the Indus, with the heavy portion of ihe overland mails from Sonthampton, both reached this port yesterday morning. The mails will probably leave Suez on the 7th inst. by the steamers Singapore and Hindostan, which arrived from Bombay and Calcutta on the 31st ult. and 2d inst. respectively.
The last tidings of the Viceroy's movements are to the effect that he had reached Khartoum, but It was stiUl uncertain whether he would proceed beyond that city. Some difficulty had been experienced in collecting means of conveyance across the Desert, and his Highness, in consequence thereof, and in order to be less impeded in his progress, had crossed from Korruasko, attended by only a smaU retinue, composed of about 100 persons. Troops will, however, no doubt still be sent up, especialy if his Highness should proceed to Kordofan or Semnaar, as it is considered that an armed force in atteddance on the Viceroy, though not indispensable for his protection, will have a salutary influence in as far as it wil serve to impress upon those for whom such proof may be desirable, that the Egyptian Government is able, as 'well as wiling, to enforce its authority over the governors it deputes to these countries, The supremacy of Egypt over its southern provinces is, however, fUlly recognized by the inhabitants, and such would appear to be the opinion of Government from the important reductions which the army is at this moment undergoing. The restoration of peace to the Ottoman Empire has led to the expression of a wish on the part of the Porte that the Egyptian army should be diminished to a maximum of 30,000 men, to which fmeasure the Viceroy promptly agreed; and it is even asserted that he has wisdy determined upon reducing his army to the number fixed in the firman of investiture granted to his father Mehemet Ali-namely, 18,000 uen. This force, properly equipped, is considered suffident for all purposes of police throughout the Egyptian dominions ; and by releasing about 20,000 men and restoring them to the labouring population, Said Pasha is conferring a solid benefit upon his country.
The vwsh expressed by the Government of Constantinople with regard to the adoption of the Turkish official costame has likewise met with faU compliance, and apparently without the slightest demur on the part of the Viceroy, though the change from the showy and flowing Nizami dress to the restraint of the Stambouli uniform appears decidedly distasteful both to officers and men. The higher classes of officers have, however, already donned the tight frock-coat and trousers, and the change wiU be gradually made in the ranks of the army.
The Nile Steam-tug Company, at least as far as regards remunerationtothe subscribers,seemsto promise 'wel. Some shares, the original cost of which was $25, have lately been sold at from $31 to $32. The operations of the company are expected to begin at the commencement of the ensuing grain sesaon.
The Alexandria grain-markets during the past fortnight, with some quieter intervals, have upon the whole been active, and the general tendency of prices has been towards increased firmness, chiefly own to the demand for Spain. Contracts for about 44,000 ardeAg of Said wheat, deliverable in January and in February, have changed hands at prices equivalent to from 41s. 6d. to 43s. per quarter free on board, as also 10,100 quarters of the ensning crop for delivery in September next, at about 33s. 6d. per quarter, free on board. As usual, there has, moreover, been a large business in contracts for fature delivery, subject to the option of a penalty for non-fulfilment. Beans are scarce, but with litUe inquiry; and arrivals of Indian corn still continue on a very smaU scale. Said wheat available for immediate shipment is worth 42s. 6d. to 45s. per quarter' free on board; beans, 32s. 6d. to 33s. 6d.
There bas been rather less activity in the cotton-market, and even a slight decline in prices, but this almost exclusively with regard to lower descriptions. Since the arrival of the mails the tendency is agin upwards.
Freights continue low. Exchange on London, 1014 to 101' per pound sterling.

OEBE5roNy OF DEmItADImG A Ro?rAN CATHOI.W PlR1ST.-'The case of Verger naturaDy calls to mind the ceremony of degradation with which a priest was formerly visited before capital punishment could be inflicted on him. A French ordonnance in 1571 was the last which prescribed this terrible formality. In the 18th century, on the refusal of the Archbishop of Aix to degrade a priest who had been condemned to death, the Parliament of Aix declared that for the future secular justice could dispense with the degradation. The following are the principal incidents of the ceremony, which, accordin- to ancient authors, never failed to produce au immense efect on the spectators --On the scaffold a bishop took his seat on a throne surmounted by a canopy, with his as.,istants seated near him, and opposite to them was a lay officer of justice. Near the prelate was a table, on whic were placed several of the sacred vessels used in the church service, together with vases of wine and water, the Gospels, the Epistles, a candelabrum with an extinguished taper, the book of exorcisms, the book of lessons, keys, a pair of scissors, a piece of glass, and the vestments and ornaments which a priest wears at the altar. The priest tobe degraded was brought forward dressed as a layman and with his hands bound. His bofids were first of all removed, and on a sign from the bishop he was decked with the ecclesiastical costume by the attendant priests. The bishop then rose, and, holding his crozier in his left hand, explained to the people the cause of the degradation. The culprit afterwards knelt at the bishop's feet, and all the persons present bent in prayer. The bishop then pronounced the sentence of degradation in these terms :-" In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen. We, -, having ascertained that the crime imputed to thee-, a priestbhasbeenreallycommitted, aud is to be justly punisbed, and finding that this o,ime is great, damnable, and ernormous, and has not only offended Divine Majesty, but agitated the whole countrywe declare that in consquence thou hast rendered thyself unworthy of ecclesiastical functions and ecclesiastical benefleer. Therefore, we, by the atuthority of the Omnipotent God, and by our own power, deprive thee now and for ever cf thy functions and benefices, and we pronounce thyderadation according to the tradition of the canons.' This Ientence being proneunced, the bishop, receiving the criminalfrom. the hands of the lay officer, scraped the Palms of the criminal's hands with the piece of glass, but without any effusion of blood, in order to remove from him the unction received at ordination. The tonsure was also scaped away in a similar nner. The priests present then placed in the hands of the culprit water, wine, the consecrated wafer, &c., but the bishop snatoced them from him, saying:-" We take from thee, or rather we show to the people that we have aleady taken from thee, the power of offering the holy sacrifice to God, and of celebrating mass either forthe livinDg or the dead." Next the bishop scraped with a knife or piece of glass the thnmb and forefingers of each hand of the culprit, and said, " By this scraping we take from theo the power of sacrificing and of blessing which thou hadst received by the unction of thy hands and thumbs." Next the bishop dragged off the chasuble from behind and sid, "We justly deprive thee of this sacred vestment, 'which signifies charity, because thou hast deprived thyself of innocence.' Then the bishop removed the stole, and said, " Thou hast disgracefully rejected the sign of God, which is this stole; and that .is why we take it from thee, and render it unfit for any sacerdotal purpose." The ceremony here concluded, and the bishop and his attendants withdrew with great pomp and on procession, the spectators bending to t& pround btsore hian as he passed.
Installation of Sir E. B. Lytton as Lord Rector of Glasgow University.
INSTALLATION of SIR B. B. LYTTON as LORD Z?ECTOR of GLASGOW UNIVERSITY.
On Thursday afternoon Sir E. Bulwer Lytton was installed as Lord Rector of GlsgowUniversity, to which office he was appointed in November last by a majority in all the nations over his opponent, Lord Stanley.
A little after 2 o'clock Sir E. Bulwer Lytton, in the robes of the Lord Rector, entered the hail, preceded by the mace. bearer, and with very great difficulty found, or rather forced, his way through the closely wedged throng to the chair. He was most heartily cheered. The Lord Rector was accompanied by the Ven. Principal Mcfarlan and the Professors of the University, Lord Elgin, the Lord Provost of the City, Sir Archibald Alison, Mr. Hastie, MP., &c
In other parts of the haill were Sheriff Bell, Sheriff Smith, Mr. Walter Crum, Mr. William Ewing, Mr. John Blackwood, publisher, Edinburgh, severalof the cityclergy, &c. The proceedings were opened by a Latin prayer, delivered by the Rev. Principal. Professor Weir read the record of the election, and administered the oaths.
Sir EDWA.1)D BmULWR t rTO, on rising, was received with immense applause. ie spoke s follows :-Mr. Principal nd Gentlemen,-If there be many more deserving than myself of the honour which has been conferred apon me, there is at least no one by whom it could be more highly valued or more gratefully received. (Cheera) Perhaps, indeed, an Englishman has a yetlivelier sense than even a native of Scotland of all that is implied in the dis. tinction which connects him with this ancient seat of learning by the free choice of its youthful students. He knows that he cannot owe so gracious a favour to the accident of birth or to local prepossession-that it mnst bh the recognition of some rank or property in repute, which, being achieved by his own exertions, wins the sympathy of the rising generation. For youth, and more especialy the hardy youth of Scotland (cheers), pressing forward to force way for itself through this crowded world, has a natural interest in seeking to ennoble every instance which confirms its own heroic hopes in the attainment of worldly distinction by the nerve and sinew of intellectual labour. I am sure that no student who has honoured me with his vote from agreement In my political opinions will misunderstand me when I say I am well pleased to believe that it is less as the politician than as the man of letters that you this day reward my labours and dignify my name. (Cheers.) Not because I am not cordially gratified if my views of the policy which hould govern these realms find favour with a large proportion of the intellect among you-not because I do not feel a warm and loyal attachment to the party with whom I act in Parliament, or am indifferent to that sanction of their cause which such a compliment to one of their number may convey; no, but because, now that a contest which I did not seek, and of which I was only aware two days before the issue was made known to me, is peacefully concluded, I would fain link myself in lasting fellowship with every student among you-and politics can but join us for the day; literature unites us throughout the ages. (Cheers.) I think that I am the more justified n assigning your kindness to this bond of associition, because the candidate who was not unreasonably preferred by 8ome of you-a young nobleman whose vigorous intellect and briDiantpromise would have done credit to your choice (cheers)-happens (no matter what differences of opinion on isolated questions may or may not exist between him and me) to belong with myself to that great party of which his own father is the acknowledged chief. (Cheers, dissent, and renewed cheers.) Nor can I believe that there can be any great disunion between those who profess the same broad outlines of policy as my lord Derby, because this much at least all who differ from that noble personage will allow-that the principles he does profess, proclaim to his partisans, and utter to the world, are conveyed in a diction unequalled for lucidity and force, and prompted by a motive conspicuous for sincerity and honour. (Cheers.) Seeing, then, that the candidate who divided your votes was not taken from the ranks of a hostile party, and that politics, therefore, could not have entered very warmly into the contest, I ventur to assume that you designed through me to pay a generous compliment to those English authors and men of letters whose names, nobler than mine, are inscribed in that libro doro, or golden book of self-made aristocracy, a place in which none of us can inherit, all of us may aspire to obtain. (Cheers.) Accordingly, it is on their behalf, as well as my own, that I receive the compliment and return the thanks. Gentlemen, when I look round this crowded hall I am seized with the same idea which presented itself to my great predecessor, Mr. Macaulay. Like him, I at once comprehend how, on a similar occasion, before a similar audience, Edmund Burke, the most elaborate and the most impassioned orator in the grand age of orators, suddenly became confused, and faltered forth the excuse that " he had never before addressed so learned an assembly." And yet it is not the learning of this distinguished audienoe which most impresses me with a sentiment of diffidence and awe; for, if we were assembled to witness some exercise of intellectual skill, in which learning alone was to be the judge, I should not be the speaker but the listener. It is not to men who have matured their full renown-it is not to your acnmowledged chiefs of erudition and science that I could presume to offer suggestive remarks or persuasive counsel. These it is my duty to address to that other part of this audience which, comprisig their pupils, represents, as it were, the geDeration of their own cidren And mcaxtmc debur pucro revercntia, I am intimidated by a sense of the reverence which is due to the young. Can I glance towards these ingenuous and ardent listeners, whom I am called upon by office to exhort or advise upon the future, and not feel with sincere emotion that the future is their hves, and that in their hves Providence may select the agents to influence a future for umborn generations? How cautious should he be who would animate the exertions of youth not to discourage the audacities of genius, nor, on the other hand, to shrink from enforcing the sober do^trine, that to all genius labour is essential; that the genius that would realise the palace of Alhddin must still be the genius of the lamp. How anxious he must feel to avoid the cold pedantry of conventional admonition, and yet to give a candid utterance to the affectien which prompts advice. Above all, students of Glasgow, he who addre.'ses you should have a spirit so warmed by sympathy with the generous aspirations of youth, so embued with the remembrance of what your fathers bave been before you, that his mind may escape from every sentiment unworthy the ears of that young chivalry which Scotland reas and mends forth to the battle of human life, with her lion at their hearts and her white cross of St. Andrew on theirshields. (Great applause.) An orator of no mean repute in the old French Republic has in one of his speeches a striking address to the 19th century, which was then just dawning over the lurid ashes of the Reign of Terror. In the jargon of that rhetorical philanthropy which then prevailed he foresaw the march of light, and the full development of human faculties andsocial progress, dating from the downfall of that disciplined order which the philosophers of his day called "privileged usurpation," and the removal of those sacred checks which they denounced as " priestcraft." Well, the 19th century rose, advanced, it is now more than half completed, and if that orator were still living he might indeed be startled to see what light has been diffused, whatthe developement of human taculties, what the advancement of social progress! During the earlier half of this century what great authors have delighted us or refined! what magical inventions science has conceived and put to use-what continuous efforts have been made, and are making still, to mitigate the severity of laws, and bind us more together, not, indeed, in Cain-likefraternity, butin Christian brotherhood! (Cheers.) But how and where have these benignant agencies of the nineteenth century been the most manifestly at work? How! Not by the disrupture of the old social ties, but by their renewed cement! Where! Not in those lands in which, to borrow Danton's despairing cry, "R evolution, like Saturn, devoureditrown children. No. But in these steadfast}ingdoms,wherelibertyasnot violatedorderm, norphilosophypresumedtodeposereligion. (Cheers.) Look back at the commencemcntof this century-contempiste the work f that generationwhich youarenowrisingtosucceod, See what your Scottish fathers have done to snatch the firebrand from the hands of those drunkards of knowledge who, reeling here and there amid palaces and temples, fancied that they illumined society by the confligration of its fabrics That brand your fathers snatched, not to extinguish its living flame-no, but to place it, aloft and calm, upon stately watch-towers, a guiding light, and not a consuu1iin fire, (Cheers.) Already, indeed, during the latter half of the last century, Scotland had produced a school of philosophers who prepared the reason of her sons to resist the plausible, but perilous materialism by whichDiderot and the writers of the French Rncyclopediie sought to quibble away the soul from man, aud the Maker from the universe. Already, for more than 30 years a professor in this university, Thomas Reid, bad expanded into an original system the suggestive lessons of Hutcheson, the founder of Scotch metaphysics, Reid died in 1796, but he left behind him a brilliant pupil, Dugald Stewfart, peculiarly adapted by the graces of acqinrement and a persuasive eloquence of style, to render populsrthedoctrineof his teacher, and to inrfuence a wide range of minds that, wrhether in lterature or action, have powerfully_*ffected the charcter of their *ges and
COuntrY (lihees. I .r not bere ._J _prnoune--
qualified sulogium upon that school of Scotch metaphysics
indeed, of late years I have had so little leisure to reexamine those analytical inquiries into the origin and formation of idea which delighted me in early youth that I could not venture to be a critic on metaphysics before an audience of Scotch colegians. But he would wholly fail to appreciate the immense benefits wbich Hutchoson, Reid, and Stewart rendered to sound philosophy, and through phiosophy to the direction of popular thou 72t and action, who should orerlook the influence which thoseScottish speculative reasoners haveexercised over the great schools of Germany-over all succeeding schools, moral or metaphysical, that have served to naralyze and d sperse the ribald builders of the atheistical Babel who Startle the last century, and left behind them the fragments of their impious labours, a futile monument of the confusionof their own tong es andtheforlorn memento of a vanished deluge. (Cheers.) But Scotland was not confining her intelect only to those subtle spculations which act latentlyon the springs of practical life. Alreadyinthisuniversity a been educated, and in this universitytaught and lectured, th great author of the Wcdch of Nations Here was a boo destined to guide the dawning century, that took the macehiery of States out of the hands of dreamers like Condoreet and Siayes; laid down those laws for theregula-
on eOf commonwealths which Plato had obscured, and een Aristotle had hleft ndefiied; shlowed to monarchs how
suies.mmghtbe filled, and to labouring populations how industry might be best applied and rewarded; here, above >l, at a time when liberty was wronged, and multitudes bwildered by schesets for destoying the bhrders, xouid

Here was a book that before the dawn of this century had already entered into the practical government of these kingdoms ; for bere was the book which, morethan all others of tbat day, skilled and disciplined the mind of William Pitt. tLoud cheers.) Not, however,with this achiennentdidScotland halt in her " march of light"-not to that memory do you stint your obligation in your illustrious Academe of Glawgow. Cbeers') Inyonder streets, whileJoseph Black was deducing is voluminmous problems from chymicalscience-while Adam Smith wsS tracing the sources of all national wealth-a young man, the listener and friend to both, was p"ndering upon the application of chymical science to the wealth of nations, the very vapour in the lamp of philosophy became the nosat natenal agent in the subjugation of time and space to the power of men, and the prophecy of Roger Bacon was realized in the inventive genius of James Watt. (Immense cheering.) But it is not science alone that instructs the world and regulates the actions of mankind. Literatute, too, has a noble mission beyond that of mere solace and delight. See at the close of the last century how tame and tawdry a thing was the literature of the Revolution ! Except only the orations of Mirabeau, and a few verses by Andre Chenier,who perished on the guillotine, sighing forth, s he touched his forehead, " And yet there was something here 1" Except these, and what feebleness and what fustian I What varnished ignorance both of books and of human nature ! The French authors who wrote under the Empire are certainly be.ter; butthey wantorig;naiity and depth In Italy one or two fair but sickly plantsstruggled forth, but the root was not such as to allow much spread to the boughs. In Germany, indeed, a mighty era in literature had commenced, but its influence had not yet extended over the rest of Europe; or where it had become visible it was through wretched translations of thateffeminateKotzebue,or ba3 asthatenlivened the nursery with skeleions and hobgoblins; and even the gigantic Goethe was chiefly known toEurope as acrackbrained sentimentalist, hohadi nvitedunsympathyzingreaderratherto laughthan toweep over the &rrow of Werter. The first great literature produced by this century, which spread over the civilized nations, thrusting back into dusty shelves the verse without souland the prosewithoutmuscle whichhadformedthecirculating library of Europe-the first great literature thatstrode forth to civilize and to conquer, restoring the ancestral past to its due place in human reverence, recalling from exile truth and nature, binding man to man in the genial chain of character and humour, refreshing this work-day world with ajoyousholyday of romance,-the first great literature which poured its own young blood into the century, and, rushizg over Europe, found a home on every hearth, rose in these islands, and, paramount in that literature, for an inflnence not less beneficent than supreme, towers your immortal countryman Walter Scott. (Great applauso.) Mleasure not Scott's greatness by his effects only on the magmaton (Hear.) By the law of ail mental vibration opinion is moved by the Pounds that first agitate feeling. What way Scott prepared vhroughout Europe for the introduction of our language, and with our language our rea'oners as well as our peots! Before his day now much the language of France had overweighted the balanceof intellectual powerin Europe ! Scott threw into the opposing scale the language of the Anglo-
axon, and the intellect of these kingdoms became hencefort, not the casual guest, but one of the ruling monarchs of the continent. (Cheers.) Thus Scotland atheredtoge-
her the broken and stormy rays of intelligence that had before rather terrified than cheered the dawn of the 19th century, and foring them first through science into pure and tranquil light, then dispersed them through literature to beautify the world with al the pomp and variety of colour. (Applause.) Meanwhile, religion rather encoura^ged than opposed the culture of the philosophy which did not invade its province. I might say, in passing, that the general character of ecclesiastical eloquence in Scotland, in that peculiarity of subtle disquisition which has been alleged against it as a fault, has had an effect akin to philosophy in the demand it makes on the reasoning and reflective power of the listener. But I hurry on to one illustrious instance of the sympathy established here between the philosopher and the preacher. I remind you of your own great Chalmers. (Cheers.) Inthis town he delivered hisfamousastronomicl discourses, and from the printing press of Glasgow issued t'hose essays in which he hasbrought to bear upon subjects purely social or philosophical an understanding so masculine, couched in a style so gravely sweet. Formed by such teachers, guided by such auspices, your fathers went forth upon the world. Not, indeed, all to bethe votaries of literature and science; not all to win distinction for their individnal selves; the large majority were contented with the simple paths of practical life. But that large majority, still dding to the aggregate character of your country, Isy the attcibutes of strong sense, patient courage, tranquil honesty, that moral dignity which commands respect, and thus, spreading on every soil where they found home the healthful influence of the native soil. (Cheers.) Students, these are the men you are to succeed and from the homes and hearths of these men you come here to discipline yonr energies and advance the name that you inherit. And will net that thought animate you more than any dry exhortation to indnstry or labour? Why, who among you would grudge any toil that might make him stil more the joy and pride of a Saottish home, or give to Scotland another of those names which preserve her nationality more distinct and sovereign than lf the Stuart still reigned in Holyrood, and the thistle were not blended with the rese? (Cheers.) Well, then, I take your industry for grantecd; let us see how and where it should be applied. And, first, there immediately comes before us the learning of Greece and Rorne-those still dead languages of that AtllM dead wo.-ld, which seems to the ignorant so indefinitely remote, and which to soholars and statesmen is always so intimately near. It has indeed leen asked
in our day, " But what avail to spend so much time in the I acquisition of languaIes which are only of use to professional scholars? Ntght be very well in thedark ages. when no other literature existed. But now in modern tongtes there is a living literature. Why not confine ourselves to the language we may have to talk, and to the books by which modern ideas are conveyed?" This sounds plausible enough; but before you allow the argument to weigh with you one jot ask any mnan not a professional scholar, but who has in youth acquired a fair acquaintance with the clasic langnages, and who has since attained to eminence in active life, at the bar, in the pulpit, in the senate, in the pubhc offlces, in medicine,-in short, any caling which requires a high degree of education-ask him if he has found the classics of any use-ask him if he would have changed the ideas he gathered from Greek and Latin for the ideas which any living literature except his own could have bestowed; and I will venture to predict that such man, if he pause to analyse his own mind, will answer that to Greek and Latin his obligations are so great that he cannot even tell what he might have been, or how far he might have succeeded, if you strack from his mind the early habits of accuracy which the study of these dead languages imperatively necessitates; or if he were compelled to exchange for French, Italian, or even German literature those large and luminous ideas which flash across him at the loosest reference to the City of the Violet Crown-or to the Conscript Fathers and the Roman Capitol. Ask, next, some man, aso eminent in life, but who has been deprived of a classical education, if he has ever felt a disadvantage in that loss; and I am no less confident that he will tell you the loss has been a subject of regret in every stage of
is career-that on many occasions it has intimidated his judgment, oppresedhimwithasenseof infirmity, obstructed She recopnsion by othersof his talentsand acquirements, and made hiso perhaps contented with some secondary grade, when but for that loss he would have jastly arrogated theforemost. (Loud cheers.) Till you have asked these questions and found that I deceive you as to the answers you obtain, take for granted that the uses of the dead languages, not only to scholars, bet to men of the world, are incontestable. And why? Why!? One obvious reason is in their very diliclty, and the continuoussand symmetrical exercise of the faculties which the contest with that difficulty requires. They disipline the powers which, whatever be our calling, we most need in after life-first, by that minute accuracy which is necessary to master the roots of the language and the order of their construction; and the habit of accuracy thus mechanicaUy contracted gives to after pursuits a truthful closeness in detail and a facility of generalization. Secondly, in the developement of a sound sense and healthful judgment, through the formation of a correct and chastened taste, accustomed early to distinguish between simplicity and vulgarity, elevation and bombast-a taste formed, not according to the mannerism of a modern tongue, which shifts with each generation, but according to models fixed and perpetual, and received as such in every civilized community. There is, too, this notable advantage in the ancient tongues over an exclissive or preponderant attemetion to the modern. Study as we will the ureek and Latin, we do not make ourselves less purely national in our own ideas or our ownrmodes of expressing them. But if, in youth, which is the season of imitation, we were to cultivate exclusively, say the French or the German, ten to one but we should half denationalize ourselves-we should Frenchify or Germanize our msinds and our style; and I think you must have observed occasionally in Great Britain, but perhaps more frequently in Aimerica, that writers who, not having accomplished themselves in classic literature, apply with p assionate devotion to a foreign modern lmangae-say the German-do really so corrupt and adulterate sober English that it seems as if they soughmt to torture their own. language into the agonized confession that it was a thievish impostor that had run aw-ay from another. (Laughter and cheers) And, whether we would
or not, I will noow show you wh those ancient languages
must, in preference to all modern tongues, remain the
groundwork Of a liberal and comprehensive education. I
ave said that youth is the season of imitation. We placo before youth not only books to read, but authors who are to serve as models of ideal excellence, and whom we commend to its special love and admiration. Where could we agree as to such models in any modern language? Take, for iqstance, the French, It is clear that models of a language must be sought in the greatest masters of its style and diction. Who are the two greatest such mnasters in French ? lUnquestionably still, in their several ways, Rousseau and Voltaire. But what prudent teacher would commend Rousseau and Voltaire as models to be studied night and day by inquisitive and imitative youth? Pass to ItalJ. However we admire the sublimity of Dante, his austere and Gothic beauties cannot furnish the models for general
study; while the other Italian masters, such as Ariosto and Bccacdo, who might furnish hints for more flowing and easy graes of style, are scarcely those whom the people of these llngdoms wvould like to see the elementary moralists
inamany and healthful education. Turn to Germany - and Gosthe meets us colossal at the threshold. But would
Goethe's wannest admirer commend to his own young sons that calm artist who so profoundly deplets our infirmities and frailties, but who rejects from his canvass the rude outlnes of fortitude and heroism-would he commend to his sons as their early study and model the greatest of the Gerrisns,whose mind has been comparedto acepola lighted from below,withthesame confidence withwhich he would dismis them to their Homer, to learn there " in the large laugNue
of the early gods"-learu to love ia Hiector the!defender of*hsA country and admire in Atchilles the foot that cannot yieddand the lips that hate *aIie as the gates of bell ? (Cheers.) Again

I pretend not hero to add to the ltssons of theeminentpe'rsons who administer the instruction. of the universitv. [can but suggest a few general hints, which may equally apply to each vocation that you may severlyaot And, first, let me impress upon yrou the
vale f dfiit purpose. Having once chosen that calling which then becomlesyourinain object'Ila life, clingtoit firmly, m-bring to bear on it all your energies, all the in5ormatiom, you are elsewhere variously collecting. All men are not born with genius, hut every man can acquire purpose, and purpose is the backbone and marrow of genius-nay, I can. scarcely distinguish one from the other. For what is genius? Is it not an impassioned predilection for some definite art or study, to which the mind converges all its energies, eatch thoughit or image that is suggested by nature or learning, solitude or converse, being habitually and involuntarily added to those ideas which Are ever retunn othe same central point, so that the mnind is not lsbulyapplying 'wheni it scorns to be the miost releasse
fo aplcation. That is genius, and that is purpose-the on mke the great artist or poet, the other the great man of action. And with purpose comes the grand secret of all worldly success, whichi some men call will, but whi.ch I would rather call earnestness. If I were asked, from my ex,perience of life, to say what attribute most impressed the minds of others or raost commanded fortune, I shoald say "fearnestness." Take, for instance, the House of Commons As the highest type, of a populaLr assembly., What is the great secret of success there? You. all remnember thatb Demosthenes placed the threefold. &ar of the orator in delivery. I think the -word. he used wvas acting or stage play. Buxt though. delivery, noetos,bt, is the appropriate excellence of the mere orator, the threefold gift of the Parliamentary speaker is earnestness. Have but fair sense and a competent knowledge of your subject, and then be thoroughly in earnest to, ipesyurt ownL honest convietion upon others, and, nomajtte'r wyhat your delivery, though your gestures shocked. every rule in Quintilian, you woald command the ear and influence the debates of the most accomplished, the most fastidious, anad, tatke it altogether, the noblest assembly-
of freemen in the world; while some man, in whoa.~ delivr no fault could be detected, except the one defect of that earnest conviction which Roscius himself could not teach if the man has not got it, would be indeed admired as a firework, but would never guide like a star. As it is in the House of Commons, which is but, the represntative of the mational mind, so it is with al life throughout thes nations. The earnest man wins way for himself, and earnestness and truth go together. Never affect to be other than you are-either richer or wiser. Never be ashamed to say, "1I do not know.' Men wfi then believe youi when you say "I do know." Never be ashamed to say, whether as applied to time or money, " I cannot afford it"-" I cannot afford to waste in hour mu theldleneastowhichyoninvite me-Icannotaffordthseguiea, you ask mne to throw away." Once establish yourself and. your mode of life as what they really are, and your foot is on solid ground, whether for the gradual step onward, or for the sudden spring over a precipice. (Cheers.) From these maxims let me deduce another-learn to say "No" with decision; "1Yes" with caution-" No" with decisiort whenesver it resists a temptation; "1Yes" with caution whenever it implies a promise. A promise onice given is a bond inviolable. (Cheers.) A mnan is already of consequence in the world wh en it is known that we can implicitly rely upon him. I have frequently seen in life aL person preferred to a long list of applicants, for some important charge which lifts him at once into station and fortune, merely because he has this reputation, that when he says he knows a thing he knows it and when he says he will do a thing_ho will do it. Mluse, gentlemen, over those maxims, you will fnd it easy enough to ractise them, for when you have added them altogeth er the sum total looks very much like-a Scotehman. (Much haughter and applause.) Let me now touch, thoagh. but humbly, as becoines a layman, upon those sacred trulths which are interwoven with your faith and enforced( by, your spiritual teacher. It is enough for me earnestly to imprs on you a reference of all your actionis to that Divine standard of good which we can never attain, but should ever seek to approach, so that, to use a homely, image, the conscience may be the bookkeeper of life. Every masn who would perform great actions must perpetually refer to some jud,S.uet or criterion elsewhere, which serves both for his stimulus and his gutide. In that terrible night when Alexander the Great was forcing his way across the swollen waves of the Hydaspe3, thunder and lightning and hurricane around him, andl the elephanLts of Porus on the oppoeite bank, he is said to have exclaimed, "1Oh. Athenians, ,%hat dangers I brave to be recorded with praise by you!I" But in coneluest-s more arduous and lasting thanu those of' Alexander-con uests which every one has to achieve over' his own heart AnZ its tempters, how grand and how accurate, becomes the motive'that stimulatesaand guides to the manwhehabitually inquires, ".How willthis bear a record in the eyes of Him who Alone unerringly reads each desire, and alone impartially weighs every deed ?"(Cheers.) Gentlemen, following thieexample set by more than one of mypredecessors, it is my intention to offer some prizes to your generous coDmpetition. I shall place, for that purpose, theonmoOe-st sum of %i guineas in the hands of your p7ofessors, leaving it to,heir discretion to select such subjects as their experience may suggest, maost useful or pleasing to the general body of the students. But, in addition to these prizes, I mayself will now propose to the highest class of your scholars a prize of 03 guiLneas to the canididate who shall most worthily render into lyricst Greek or Latin, at thechoice of theo comnpetitors one of the immortal songs of Robert Burns. (Vehement applause.) At that name I find myself, in conclusion, naturally carred back to the ideas with which I commenced my, direct appeal to you as your Rector. I commence-d that. Appeal by invoking your national pride, so that you might be worthy the heritage andatransmissionL of your national renown. Nor do I believe that there is one thoughtful Englis'hman who wil blame me for that invocation;- for what patriot can desire, what reasoner expect, what statesm an be enabled, to erase from a land the traditions that hallow it, or rob from the heart of a free people the history which is its life-blood, beats in every pulse, and tingles in every vein ? This is no requisite in the obligations of that union which links the interests and blends the loyalty ofkinredracs seakng ne angageand suabject to a.

The Great Northern Railway Frauds.
IME GREAT NORTHERN RAILWAY
FRAUDS.
CENTRAL CRININAL COURT, JA. 16.
Ths trial of Leopold Rtedpath, late registrar and transfer clerk to the Great Northern Railway Company, for the ex. tensive frauds alleged to have been committed by him upon his employers, commenced at 10 o'clock this morning before Mr. Baron Marti and Mr. Justice Wiles. An amount f interest equal to that manifested in the trial of 'the bullion robbery case was manifested in the proceedings of lo-day, and there was a large number of spectators in court during the whole of the sitting; but the judicious arrangements made by the sheriffs were, As on the provious occasion above-named, such as to prevent anything like overcrowding, or that disturbance to the course of the inquiry usually tncident to the indiscroiinate i dmission of the public.
Charles James Comyns Kent, who acted as clerk under Radpath, and is accused of being concerned in his fraudulent transactions, was placed in the dock along with the principal prisoner; but it was arranged that the indict. ment brought against Redpath separately should be proceeded with in the firat instance. There are various counts charging the prisoners with forging transfers of the Great Northern Pilway Company's stock, and also with conspi. racy, Before the rising of the Court yesterday Redpath and Kent were formally arraigned, and both of them pleaded "Not Guilty."
Redpath is a ratl,er taU man, apparently about 40, and has a healthy but somewhat sulleu look. He is slightly bald, but wears a profusion of beard under his chin. He is respectably dressed, yet there is nothing particularly flashy about him, nor indeed anything, either in his carriage or his expression of countenance, to indicate the successful swindler, lately rolling in il-gotten riches and confident in the resources of his own deep cunning. Althoughthe degradation of figuring in the felons' dock did not seem to disconcert him much he had yet the air of a man who despaired of the least chance of acquittaL The industry he displayed in taking memoranda during the examination of the diferent witnesses who appeared against him had but little effect in weakening the impression otherwise conveyedby his doport3nent-namely, that he was a desperate criminal brought at last to bay, and withou' the faintest hope of eluding the penalty due to his profligate career. The more youthfla prisoner, Kent, is quite boyish in appearance, and sprightly In his movements, and the quickness and self-composure with which he used his pen or conversed with Redpath might easily have been taken for consummate aoting, so ) erfectly did his bearing at the bar resemble that of a clerk foUowing his ordinary avocations in the counting-house.
The counsel engaged in the case were-Mr. Serjeant Ballantine, Mr. Bodkidn, and Mr. Giffard for the prosecution of both the prisoners; Mr. Serjeant Parry and lr. Tindal Atkinson for Redpath, and Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Thomp. scn defended Kent.
The jury having been duly sworn,
Mr. Serjeant BALLNTQ rose to open the proceedings on behalf of the prosecutors. He esid,-Gentlemen of the jury, although this case, like the one that has just occupied this Court for several days,has excited much public attention, owing to the position of the prisoner, and to the extent of the fraudulent transations in which he has beea engaged, yet the facts which you wil have to investigate lie within comparatively little compass, and you will therefora be spared any lengthene, statement from me. After hear. ing those facts it wiU be for you to say whether they make out against the prisoner the charge which he has now to answer-that of forging a transfer of the stock of the Great Nlorthern Railway Company. The prisoner at the bar-a person of apparent respectability-was in the employ of the company I have named. Let me give you a brief history of his position in the company from an early date, and show you the situation he held at the time of the alleged forgery, Formerly there were two lines of railway connecting London with the north, one of which was caUed the Direct Northern, and the other the London and York line. The two railways were managed by different boards of director?, and each of themhad its own secretary. Aftersome discussion in Parliament it was deemed advisable to amalgamate the two lines, and the consequence was that one of the seocretaries was thrown out of the position which he originally held. It was, however, thought necessary that another appointment should be created,-viz., that of registrar, which was given to a gentleman named clarke, who was previously one of the two secretaries. While in this new situation the prisoner acted as a subordinate, assisting Mr. Clarke in the business of his office. After some further time it was not felt desirable to continue Mr. Clarke any longer at his post of registrar, and the prisoner at the bar, who was thought to be fitted by experience and character for its duties, succeeded to this situation. The business to be done was of a very complicated description. A great variety of stocks had been created by act of Parliament, and dividends of different kinds and amounts were paid upoa them at the same periods; and considerable calculation was requisite to bring out the respective quotas of dividend to which the various classes of shareholders were entitled. The prisoner was also necessarily acquainted with all the books of the company from the date of the commencement of these transactions; and it was his duty to know who were the different shazeholders in the concern, the stock they held, and the amount of divi. dend payable to each, and likewise to place against every name the sum due to its bearer. Be had thus great facilities for the commission of fraud, if he were desirous of doig so. Let me now point out the transactions ia which he was concerned, and you will then be able to tell whether they were forgeries or not. The charge against him is that of forging and uttering a forged deed of transfer of the stock of the company-viz., So. 3,623, for a sum of 3121. 10s. It appears from an examina tion of the books of the company, which wil be produced before you, and explained by witnesses whom I shall call,
that an amount of stock was brought into the company's books-about the period when this forgery is alleged to have taken place, in favour of a person named "John Morris, of Manningtree, Essex." The mode in which this stock was brought in wil be seen by reference to other books to which I shall cal your attention. The first false entry is made in this iorm-" 0. B., 196, 1,2501." This inrntended to be a reference to one of the company's books called the "old book," at folio 197, in which the shares are referredto as "'B shares." You wil also find other entries of a similar nature. Oneof themis "A" stock No. 4.341; another is " A "' atock No. 5,870; and they refer to former books, of which inspection must be mnade to ascertain the authenticity and value of these entries. There are also other numbers, such as 4,341, 4,342, and 4,343, which refer to other books; and I mention them separately because they belong to a different description of stock from the rest. You wil find that the whole of this stock has been disapoed of under deeds of transfer. The deed to which I first caled your attention-viz., No. 3,623, for 3121. 10s., would have entitled John Morris to transfer his interest in that stock had he gone to a stockbroker and produced it. The Per.son purporting to transfer this stock is John Morris. of Maaningtree, Essex, and the person purporting to attest is a man named Shaw, represented by the deed to belong to the same neigbbourhood. The transfer is accordinrgly made by the prisoner to his owu name, and sold through his own stockbroker. The money is paid to him for it, and there is an end of the transaction. Supposing there is any right on the part of John Morris to transfer that stock the transferee would be the person entitled to hold it, and he is placed on the book as the person entitled to hold it. I may mention that the state of the accouuts of the company attracted the attention of the secretary, Mr. Mowatt, not because any doubt was entertained of the honesty of the prisoner, in which implicit confidence was placed,
ihit because of certain irregularities of method which that gentlemau discovered one day when the prisoner was away. This induced Air. hlowatt to demand a clear statement from ihe prisoner; and, feeling it his duty to look over the books to ascertain the nature of the irregularities, Redpath did not snake his appearance again at the office, when it was found that he had gone off to Paris. Ultimately, however, he was given into cuMtody, and the inquiry instituted which has resulted in this prosecution. lt was discovered that nO such persons as eitherJobn Morris or Timothy Shaw (the alleged attesting witness) ad any real existence, and that their names were both deliberate forgeries. His Lordship will tell you that the forgery of a non-existent namne is equally punishable with the forgery of that of any living person. But not only was it found that there were no such persons as Morris and Shaw, but, on refering to the old book, in which, according to the recent books, the first credit to Morris appeared, it turned out that there was nothing vOiatever in the old book relating to Morris; that the whole account purporting to be in his name was absolutely fictitious; and its introduction into the new books an invention ofiRedpath's to prop u p the fraud which he had committed. In five other cases it was found that there were, indeed, accounts in the books, but accounts referring to other people; and that in every instance in which Morris's na.me
wsused the stock belonged to other persons than
tne person purporting to hold them, So that the prisoner ia the one case fraudulently created a new kind of stock, and in the other took stock from the rightful owners and introduced it into the books with the purely irmaginary name of Morris in order to carry ouhis crminal purpose. The amount which the prisoner contrived by these means to got into the name of Morris was io less than 10,0001. upon these two accounts. But th) psisoner is not only charged with forgery, but with uttering forged transfers with a guilty knowledge. To prove this I shall put in about a dozen other transfers of the company's stock, by which Redpath sweeps away the entire 10,001., and also robs either the company or the individual owners of the stock for whoso property, according to the law on the subject, the company was xesponsible. These, gentlemen, are briefly the circunmtances which I have to bring before you. The case, although one of - very great importance, is not likely, as I have said, to bd a protracted one. I and the learned friends associated with sue will therefore now proceed to substantiate by evidence the facts which I have just narrated.
fleiiry Atterbury, examined by Mr. BODN .-I am a clerk in the service of the Great Northern Railway ComppaDy, and havebeen so for several years. The registration
*'f stock did not come within my department until the rronth of February, 1856, when I was called in to assist in tLe business of the registrar's offlce in consequence of somethirg that then occurred. I produce a transfer, dated May ?, 1852, the number of which is 3,623, and it purports to
be a transfer from John Morris to William Henry Hlm. 3mond, of 3121. l1s. of the B stock of the company. In this f ntiy the names of Mlorns, the transferrr, and that of Timothy Shaw, the attestingwitness, are, I believe, in the handwriting of the prisoner Redpath. I also produoe the register-book, in which there is an entry of the transfer in the prisoner's handwriting, the letters "0 . B." being annexed to it to denote that it is brought forward from an old book of the company. On examining the old book to trace this entry, I find there no account whatever in the name of John Morris, as represented in the newer book. The register also contains the following other entries of trnsfers, viz.:-
No. 4,340, B stock, 1,2501.; No. 4,341, A stoock, 3,7601. ; No. 4,342, 1,6254., A stock; No. 4,343, B stock, 1,625C. ; and No. 5,870, A stock, 1,7501. This stock is placed to the credit of Morris, Morris's name bein m all the entries written in the handwriting of Red path. On the credit side of Morris's account thereis 5,500. of A stock, and 4,5001. of B stock, making togther, between the two kinds of stock, 10,00W. On the debit side of the account there is an entry of a transfer from John Morzis to W. H. Mote, dated May 7, 1852, of 4371. lOa. in B stock. Timothy Shaw is here again the attesting witness, and his name and that of Morris are in Red. path's handwriting, Next comes No. 3,573, 125. B stock, purporting to be a transfer from Morris to a person named Proader, dated May 7, 1852, and Shaws and Morris's names are in the pisoner's handwriting. No. 3,591 is a transfer from Morris to George Wise, 7th of May, 1852, of 501. B stock ; No. 3,623 is a transfer from Morris to Bennett Pell, 7th of May, 1852, of 2874 B stock. To these Shaw is again attesting witness, and his and Morris's names are in Redpath's handwriting. The ease is the sambwith regard to entry No. 3,663, being a transfer of 371. lOs. B stock. Next oomes a tran*fer of 1,25A0. of B stock from Morris to J. Hardy, 16th of September, 1852. The attesting witness in thiscase purports to bo " George Sidney, Hampstead-road,"and hisname and that of Morris are in tho prisoner's handwriting. No. 5,697 was a transfer of 2,5001. A stock from Morris to one iamed Marrsatt. No. 5,713 is a transfer from Mforris to a person called Pierce, 30th September, 1852, of 751. A stock. No. 5,756 is a transfer of 2001. A sitock from Morris to Seager. No. 5,776 is a transfer of 621. 10s. A stock from Morris to Figgins, 30th September, 1852. No. 6,109 Is 1,6251. B stock, another transfer from 3Morris, dated 14th of October, 1852. No. 6,553 is a transfer from Morris to Burchell of 6251. B stock, dated November, 1852. No. 6,700 is another transfer from Morris of a sur of 1,7501. of A stock. In the whole of these entries the name of George Sidney appears as attesting witness, and that name andthe name of Morris in each case are, Ibelieve, iu Redpath's handwriting. The witness then detailed other entries of a similar nature in the transfer.book, in which the names of Morris and also of the subscribing witness were in the prisoner's handwriting, the result of his evidence being to show that the total amount of the fraudulent entries upon both sides of Morris's ccount alone was 17,600Z., or 9,3501. in A stock and 8,2501. in B stock.
The witness was then cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Pm.nY, in answer to whom he said-There is a shareregister kept by the company in accordance with the act of Parliament. I have been in the registra's office since February last. Redpath was at the head of that office. My services were "lent" to the registrar's office by Mr. Reynolds, the accountant. In that office there are sx other clerks besides myself. Some of them have been there longer than I have.
Mr. Serjeant PARRy.-Have you not been brought forward as a witness because you know less of these transactions than any of the other clerks?
Witness.-l have not.
Will you swear that you have not been called for that reason 7-I wilL The greater part of the entries in the old book are in theprisoner's han writing
Mr. Serjeant Y.-Let me call your particular attention to the signatures of John Morris and Timothy Shaw. Will you swear, without hesitation, that these signatures are in Redpath's handwriting ? Witness.-I wilL.
Look at the entries numbered from 4,340 to 4,343 both inclusive, and tell us whether you can swear that you have not a shadow of a shade of doubt that the names are in the handwriting of the prisoner ?-I can swear that I have no doubt about it,
Did you ever see the prisoner write ?-I have, frequently. I have taken a great many documents to him, and seen him write upon them.
Is the signature of Hammond in Redpath's handwiting? -No; it is Mr. Hammond's own vwriting
Then it is a genuine signature ?-It is.
Of the three subscribing witnesses you swear, then, to the names of two of them being in the prisoner's handwriting?
Have you ever known mistakes to be made in the register of transfers ?-There have been mistakes, no doubt.
In the entry of a transfer did you ever omit the name of a purchaser X-I never did.
Do you know vwhether such things have ever been done by the other clerks ?-I do not.
You are aware that the act of Parliament requires the transfers of stock to be endorsed by the secretary; and can, therefore, tell us whether any of the transfers in question have been endorsed by Mr. Mowatt ?-They certainly have not been so endorsed, but they are numbered according to the numbers in the register. There are five different kinds of stock belonging to the company, besides the A and B stock.
Has the secretary never endorsed them according to the act ?-I believe not. He has never written his name upon them. All the transfers are entered in the transfer receipt book, and it is some one's duty to verify them. All the transferrees of this transferred stock have been receiving dividend from the company ever since the year 1852. 1 know several of the directors of the Great Northern Company. I know Mr. Graham Hutchinson, for instance, and Mr. Denison, the chairman. I also know Mr. Reynolds, the accountant of the company.
Don't you know that all these gentlemen bave held stock in the company in fictitious n4mes 7-I do not.
Don't you know that they have all held stock in different names to their own ?-I know that soime of them have.
Don't you know that some of them have held stock in one, two, and three different names to their own9.-I do not.
Have you ever lent your name to a director ?-No. I do not know of any of the other directors holding stock in different names to their own. I never borrowed money from Redpath but once. That was in July of last year. I owe him 171. I intend to repay him.
Are you aware whether Mr. Reynolds, the accountant, ever borrowed money from the prisoner 9-I am not.
Do you not know that he has borrowed to the extent of 12,0001. from Redpath ?-I do not. I was never in a position to know it.
Do you find Mr. Reynolds's name in the company's books ?-I do.
Do you not know that his name is down in the company's books to the amount of from 50,0001. to 100,0001. ?-I do not.
What, then, is the amount ?-I don't know.
Do you know whether or not these were Mr. Denison's shares ?-No, I do not. I 1852 Redpath kept the ledger as clerk in the registrar's office.
Re-examined by Mr. BODKIN.-Hammond is a friend of Redpath's. He held no office in the company. I have seen him. He is about 25 years of age. I intended to repay Redpath by over-time for the money I borrowed temporarily fromn him.
John CawkilL examined by MIr. GIFFAR.D.-I am a clerk in the employ of the Great Northern Railway Company, and have held that situation for eight years. I have had many opportunities of seeing Redpath's handwriting. The signatures of "Morris" and "Timothy Shaw," in the transfers now produced, are both in the prisoner's handwriting.
Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant PARRY.-I am not aware of mistakes being ever made in the books by the omission of the name of the vendor or the purchaser of stock. Iswear that I believe the names of Morris and Shaw in warrant No. 3,623, now in my hand, are both in the prisoner's handwriting. The transfers al bear the official stamp of the company; and when a transfer is sent to the officer a certificate is issued to the buyer. The certificates are issued by the registrar, and not by the secretary; but the name of the secretary appears upon them, on the brand. This brand is not affixed in the secretary's office.
Do you mean that any one who pleases can affix the brand with the secretary's name upon it ?-No. Any one can do it who is in the office of the transfer registrar.
Have you ever dealt in stock ?-No.
Re-examined by Mr. Serjeant BALLANTI?.-A transfer is not endorsed by the secretary, but has a number upon it corresponding with the receipt book.
Henry James Wood, of the firm of Field, Son, and Wood then deposed that he had acted as broker to Redpnth, *nd p roved that he had sold the Great Northern stock No. 3,623 at the request of the prisoner, and paid over the pro. ceeds to him.
Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant PAnRy.-Redpath has speculated in stock for the last eight years. We conducted the business for him. His transactions with us were to a large extent.
Perhaps they reached 100,0001. ?-No; they were not so extensive as that. The prisoner speculated also in the stock of the Great Indian Railway.
Did heomake a,oney by that?-Yes, to a considerable
Did his gains amount to 10,0001. or so?-No; somo hundreds of pounds would be nearer themark.
Thomas Morris examined.-I reside at Wix, near Man. ningtree? Essex. I never heard of any person named John Morris living there. I never held any of the stock of the Great Northern Railway Company.
Cross-examined.-Wix is about 4 miles from Manning. tree. Manningtree has about 1,100 inhabitants.
William Rayner examined.-I have lived at Manningtree fer the last 17 years, and was postmaster of that place in 1852, as well as assistant-clerk to the magistrates, clerk to the Commissioners of Taxes, and registrar of births, deaths, and marriages for the division. No person named John Morris lived there. I should have known of it if he had.
Cross-examined.-I don't know everybody in Manningtree particularly (laughter), but I don't think there are 50 people there with whom I am not more or less acquainted.
Mr. Thomas W. Count, the overseer of Manningtree, was also called to show that there were no such persons as Morris and Shaw residing inthat pariah.
This concluded the case for the prosecution.
Mr. Serjeant PARRy then addressed the jury on behalf of the prisoner. He said,-Gentlemen of the jury, it is now about 26 years since the first railway made in Englandthat between Manchester and Liverpool-was opened to the public, and you will all remember that on that occasion the country was deprived by an accident of the services of an
eminent statesman, Mr. Husldsson. That is far from being the greatest calamity which has been brought upon this country by the establishment of railways. In themselv.8
thce- iron roads havo been of the greatest service to the public, bun those who have had the manago-
iment and direction of them have been parties to. the perpetration of frauds to an enormous extent, and by the spirit of gambling and speculation which they have in-
tioduced have been the Atn do thousands -of families, nd if
your verdict against the prisoner at the bar shouldbe " Guilty," it will be his tuiu also.' He entered the service of the Great Northern RailUwa Company ~sout .eight years ago, and, as is clear frota the reluctant evidence cf Mr. Atterbury, he fotmd In the.office of the company a wide-spread system of upeclation and of trading in shares E ld stocks under other people's names-under names not un frequently entirely fictitious. Whatever the opinion of th i directors of the railway may be on this point, I have no hedtation in saying that such a mode of carrying on busi
ness is a deliberate fraud upon the publi9, and, however this investigation may terminate, there is not the slightes doubt that Mr. Redpath has been brought inato this position entirely by the unfortunate circntstance of his becoming a clerk in the Great Northern Railway Company. I have had gpat difficulty in elieiting from the witnezes evidence which would warrant these observations, because the prosecution has carefully kept back every offlcial of the company, every clerk' in the registration-office, who could have told you whether these fraudulent dealings in shares and stocks do go on or not. Only two witnesses were caled to prove the handwriting of Redpath. Mr. Mowatt, the secretary of the company. is kere, but they dare not call him. I do not know whether any of the directors are here or not, but I should have likei to have some of them In the witness-box tbat I might have asked them wrhether it is true, as the witness Atterbury adsitted he knew from inspecting the books, that several of the directors hold shares and stock in other ersons' names. We ought to bave had some person called before us who would have been able to state whether this is not the case, and whether the directors are not in the habit of putting stock in other people's names in order to prevent its being depreciated, by 'ts beia'
known on the Stock-Exchange that the stock in tSe market in reality belongs to the company. 1 Mr. Redpath is guilty of the oftence with whIch he is charged he has bea led to his ruin by living in the atmosphere of gambling ani seculation which exists in the Great Northern Railw&y
Company's offices. But is Redp%thguilty? There cangb no doubt that no such person as John Morris of Mannintree exists; but I think you will have great difficulty i'l coming to the conclusion that both the signatures to this transfer, John Morris and Timothy Shaw, are in Redpaths handwriting, and if you doubt that both are you must cooas to the conclusion that neither is. Mr. Atterbury, indeed, has sworn that they both are, but he is evidently actuated by some animosity against Redp 'Sh and you mnst have noticed that he gave his evidence in anything but that cautious, careful manner which is usually displayed by witnesses to handwriting. He was confident, he had no doubt whatever, though at tho best he can have nothing more then a belief on the subject, for he did not see Redpath write it. Why did not the company produco befere us, to prove Redpath's handwriting, some witness
who had the opportmtityof lnowingitbetter and not a clerk who has been inthe ,tration,offlce some twelve months, adfIly passing over live or six others whohavebeen in th-e ofice for years? Theee, I submit to you, are cirncmstanose which should make ;ou pause before you come to the conclusion that the slgntures to those two deeds are in Redpath's handwritn' . But, gantlemen, I would ask you, are you at all satisfied that these are not transfers of genuine stock ? A variety of accounts have been placed before you in Redpath's handwriting, but I think you wDI find great ditliculty in concluding from thein that this transfer does not represent genuine stock. The act of Parliament requires that every transfer should be taken to the secretary's office and there endorsed by the secretary, but there does not appear to have been any procedmue of the sort in the Gfeat Northern Railway 1,Com-
anyts office. The ,ompany has systematically violated the law in that respect. One of the transfers is in the name of Stephen George Hammond; he is a living person; why has he not been called before you to give us an account of this transaction? Gentlemen, I am sure you will not allow yourselves to be made the instruments of sacrificing Redpath to cover the irregularities which it is clear, if Atterbury is to )be believed, are carried on in the office of the Great Xorther Railwfay-of makindg him the scapegoat for the directors and other officials. I have not condescended to ask yon to dismiss from your minds the stories which have been current as to Mr. Redpath's past career. They are all gross exaggerations. I am instructed to give to them all a most peremptory denial. He is a man who for years has speculated on the Stock Exchange in hundreds and thousands of pounds. Had not this case excited so much pubEc attention it would not have lasted so long as it has-for the facts of it lie in the smallest possible compass, and in your hands I leave it, confident that it will receive from you all the attention which its importance to the prisoner and to the publio at large demands.
Mr. Justice WILLES then proceeded to sum up the evidence. The question for the jury to derdde wld be whether the instrument before them was a real or a fictitious transfer of stock belonging to the Great Northern Railway Company, and whether it had been executed by the prisoner for the parpose of defrauding the Great Northern Railway Company or the person to whom the transfer was made. With reference to the question of intention, if the jury should be of opiion that the transfer was fictitious, that would of itself be sufficient to show fraudulent intention, because either the company would have to makq good to the transferree the amount of stock which it puroorted to represent, or the transferee would have to suffer the loss of the sum which he had paid in consideration for it. One party or the other must be defrauded. Then would come the question whether or not it was made by Redpath. His Lordship then briefly directed the attention of the jury to the evidence adducea by the prosecution to show th at no such stock as that parported to be trausferred did in reality exist in the books of the company, and also to the evidence to prove the nonexistence of any such parsons as Morris and Shaw. As to the question whether the transfer was executed by. the prisoner, it would be for the jury, with the document itself before them, to consider whether they were satisfied with the evidence of those witnesses who had sworn that the signatures to it were in the urisoner's handwriting. If they were, and if they should ;t the same time be of opindon that the transfer was not a transfer of genuine stock, it would be their duty to find the prisoner guilty.
The jury, after a fewn minutes' deliberation, without leaving the box, returned a verdict of Guilty.
Charles James Comyns Kent was then placed at the bar, and the two prisoners were put on their trial together, for jointly forging and uttering a transfer of stock of the Great Northern llailway Company, purporting to be of the value of 1,087f. Os., with intent to defraud.
3Ir. Serjeant BsirA?rnqX briefly opened the case, which, he said, as regardedRedpath, closelyresembled that on which he had just been found guilty. The prisoner Kent was a clerk in the ofice of the Great Northern Railway Company, immediately under Redpath, and the charge against him was that be had lac h name as attesting witness to forged transfers of stock, well knowing at the time he did so that they were forged, The particular transfer for which they were now placed at the bar purported to be from
Stephen GeorgeHammond," described as of Barge-yard, Buchlersbury. to a person named George Sidney, of 20, Edward-street, Hampatead-road. This transfer was an entirely fictitious one. Sidney would be shown to be an entirely fictitious personage, and it would be shown, also, that the attestation to this transfer was in the prisoner Kent's handwriting. Stephen George Hammond, however, was a real personage. He was a godchild of Redpath, and his name, it would appear, had been used very extensively in the books of the company as the holder of the stock. About the time when this trausfer was made a certain amount of dividend would have been payable on what purported to be Hammond's stock, but, it not suiting Redpath's purpose that Hammond's name should be brought forward, an amount of stock which was purely fictitious was transferred from Hammond's name, and in this manner his account was exactly balanced, so that he had no dividend to receive. Kent was a party to this transaction by signing his name to the transfer, and the fictitions stock so created and transferred was so1d by Redpath, and the purchase-money received by him. The whole transaction was a juggle concocted between Redpath and Kent. For the purpose of showing that Kent had been inthe habit of attesting transfers of this description he should put in several transfers to a fictitious person called Spranger, which were forgeries of Redpath, and which were also attested by Kent. The question for the jury to d\ecide would be whether it was possible for Kent not to have known that these transfers were fictitious and were concocted for the purpose of defrauding the comDany. If so, it would be their duty to convict him of the offence of forgery.
Mr. Baron MARTIN said it would be desirable that the evidence in this case should be confined strictly to Kent's share in the transaction.
Henry Atterbury, clerk in the service of the Great Northern Railway Company, examined by Mr. BODKiL, said-The transfer produced purports to be a transfer of stock in the Great NorthernRailway Company to the amount of 1,0871. 10s. from Stephen George Hammond, of Bargeyard, Bucklersbury, to George Sidney, of 20, Edward-street, Hampstead-road. It is numbered 16,774. The signature
S tehen Gezgo Hammond" is in Rdahshnwiig as is also sinaur "George Sidney." Charles Kent gis the a ttsigwteso thE signasture of George Sidney, and
ihandRwritintg. In the ledger of the compayIfn ntries I[ammond to Sidney, which correspond with th trasfe...;
a:ne arausrer came into the office onthe 10th of Februrry, 1855; and the books closed on the 6th of February. It exactly balanced Hammond's account at the time. Redpath at that time had oversold his own account to the amount of 2,3151. The vaicus transfers prdued PurPort to he from Leopold Redpath to R6bert ZJefforlesd Sprnger, - of Htraley, near Winchester. The signature of Spranger in everyone of them is in the handwriting of Redpath, and the attesting witness is the prisoner Kent.
Mr. Serjeant Pxan-y said, that after the intimation just given by his Lordship he shouldI not think it necessary to cross-examine any of the witnesses on behalf of the prisoner Redpath.
Atterbury, cross-examined by Mr. HAwKNS (for Kent). said,I was nt aware that Redpath had stock in the Great Northern Railway Company standing in various names untilthe commencement of thisinvestigation. There arc in our books 33 transfers of stock in the name of Sidney, and the signatures are all in the same handiwriting. Some of them are attested by Kent. some by Redpath, and some by CawkhMil. There may bef some attested bv other persons, but without'going through the transfer book I cannot tell. I have heard in the bffice that some of the directors hold stock in other names besides their own. I have heard that Mr. Graham Hutchinson, a director. holds stock to the amount of 100,000L in other persons' names, bet I do not know that that is so of my own knowledge. Sprangoes transfers were not mentioned at Clerken-elL There was some objection on the part of the officers of the com-
axny to produce the register-book at Clerkenwell
l have never posted entries in the ledger to the namne of Sidney. save hen in the employ of the copn since 1851. I do not know what .ent's salary was At the offlce he w as considered a steady respectable young man. He was very attentive to his duties, and he wvs a great favourite with all the officials. I do not know of my own knowledge that on one occasion Kent had a gratty
'Wessited to him for good conduct. Rent' was marriel
ahortly before he wasapprehended on this charge --
e-examined by Mr. BoDmx.-The counselor the pro. aecuW,n offered at Clerkenwell to p,roduce xUa the docamentg ietin,g to this charge, but he eci to produce any
Stephqn George Hammond, examined by Mr. Serjeact BATTSANSz.-I reside at No. 46, Gower-place, Euston. suare, and am of no business or profession. I am 20 years Of age,; I am no connexion or reltion of Redpath's, bat I hav limed in his house on and off for three or four years. The ignature to the transfer numbered 16,774 is not m my haihdwriting. I knew nothing of it, and never myself put any mnoney. into the Great Northemn ailway Company. I never receaved any nioneyfor that transfer.
' Cros* xamined by Mr. HLwixEws.-I knew hat there was stock standing in my name, and I knew that it was Redpath's stock. He has told me on several occadons that he has-put stock inmy name He has told me also that he had stock standing in the name of Sidney, and I bAve seen a trausfer in that name.
Iaveyou yourself signed transfers?
Serjeant BALLAL;5}ni objected to the question.
Baroot MAnRIN.-Do you mean as a principal or as a witness?
Mr. HLwxThs.-As a prindpal,
Baron MATIN.-If the question is objected to, yo cannot put it, although it is often asked without being objected to.
Cross-examination continued.-I have myself been asked to execute transfers
Have you refused to do so?
Serjeant BAiLAN4Mz objected to thls question, that any conversation between the witness and another person was not evidence in this cause.
The COURT ruled that the question might be put.
Cross-examination continued-I have not refuseo to do so.
Has Redpath told you that he has signed transfers in your name?
Serjeant BALLA-N'mig again objected.
Baron MARTq .--Redpath and Kent are charged with forging a certain transfer, No. 1,774, purporting to be fr6m Hammond to Sidney. The question is clearly admis. sible.
Cross-examination continued.-I do not remember Redpath ever having told me so, blt i will not swear that he hsnot. If hehadtoldme so halfa dozen timesI should have remembered it. I cannot swear whether he has told me so a dozen times. I don't remember his ever having toldl .me so. I can't say I was frequently -at the office of the Great Northern Railway. I used to go there to aem Redpath. It might have been about stock and shares. It -was not always.-Was ast generalUy ?-Woll, I have been there to seo him about stock. I could'nt swear how many times -I have been there to see him about stock. I am not a speculator in stock or shares at all. I had some mining shares given me by Mr. redpath. I had no menss of existence myself. Mr. R"4path parly brought me up and educated me. He edaeate nmefrom 1850 to 1852. Alter 1852 I was a clerk in a mining company.
Re-examined.-I have not seen Mr. Redpath in Nevgate, Aor have I had any communication with him, his solicitor, or his solicitor's clerk-upon this subject.
Robert Mayland, of No. 20, Edward-street, Hampstead road, deposed, in answer to Mr. Grs'AiD, that he h lived in his present house for the last 12 years, That there was no other No. 20 in the street, and that no onenamed Geore Sidney had ever lived there. Abouteight or nine years ago the prisoner Redpath himself had resided there.
The Rev. Robert Jefferies Spranger, examined b Sereant BALsieurn.-I reside at Hursley, near Winchester. Jhaveno stock in the Great Northern Railway. Thetraus. fers produced, purporting to be in my handwriting, am not signed by me. Neither are they signed by my father, who died in lebruary, 1850.ar
Mr. J. E. Mowatt, examined by Mr. BoDn r.-I am secretary to the Great Northern Railway Company. Redpath was origiany a clerk in the registration department, ut about three years ago he sueceeded to the head -of the transfer department, and Kent was then, appointed chief clerk. During Mr. Redpath's temporary absence it would be KenVs duty to conduct the department.
Cross-examined by Mr. HAWIrn&-There were altogether five clerks in the transfer department:-Redpath, Kent, Cawkhill, Freenan, and Fleming. I knew latterly where l?edpath lived, but I was neveron visiting terms with him -certainly not - neither were any of the directors, so far as I am aware. k'ent had been in the offlce for seven or eight years. During the whole of that time his conduct had been tolerably good, but, being a youngster, it *as necessary occasionally to give him a 'ttle good advice, and I, being an oldster, gave it him. Redpath was lving in very good style-I believe at Regent's Park; h ut I know no more shout it than you, Sir.
This was the case for the prosecution.
Mr HAwxPr.i then addressed the jury on behalf of Kent. He said he had always thought when a serious charge was preferred against any individual, more particularly when it was preferred against a young man in the position of the prisoner at the bar, that the fair and candid mode of procedure on the partof the prosecutionwastolay beforethe jnry every particle of evidence which could by possibility tend to throw any light upon the trsaction; because a man in Kent's position was placed in many instances in almost insuperable difficulties. The policy of the law forbade a man who was put upon his trial on a criminal charge goin
into the witness-box to give upon oath his own account of the transaction. However anxious, therefore, such a person might be that the jury should know everything, his mouth must be closed, and he must rely for his defence unon the feeble exertions which his advocate might miake on his behal. He (Mr. Hawkins) now appeared for the young man at the bar, who was just entering upon what he might term the sPring of life. He had been in the service of the Great Northern Railway Company from the time that their office was first opened at Kingscross. He had from that hour until the time when he was arrested, on the 11th of November, enjoyed the good opinion and entire confidence of every one who had the least connexion with the railway. Ie had not done anything to abuse that confidence, and it was to his counsel a matter of extreme satisfaction that when he should sit down he would be followed by a crowd of witnesses, all of them gentlemen of the highest respectability, who had known the prisoner almost L-om his infancy, and who would testify with the utmost satisfaction that they believed him to be a man of unsulied character, whose honour and integrity were still uninpeached. The charge against the prisoner was for combinng with Redpath to forge a certain transfer purporting to have been executed on the 10th of February, 185, by Stephen George Hammond to George Sidney, to which transfer he, Kent, was the attesting witness. The signatures of Hammond and Sidney were proved to have been in the handwriting of Redpath; but it was his (Mr. Hlawkins's) duty to satisfy the jury that Kent had no fraudulent design in attesting those signatures, and that there was really no pretence for including him in this indictment. His learned friend, Serjeant Ballantine, in oening the case, had said that he would prove that these oc=ments were concocted for fraudulent purposes, and that Kent must have perfectly well known the state of Hammond and Sidney's accoants. His lesarned friend, however, biad failed to prove anything of the sort; he had not called a single witness to show that there was one line of Kent's handwriting in any of the books produced, and he (Mr. Hawkins) contended, therefore, that ther wan pretence for the opening statement of his learned friend that Kent had a fulRlknowledge of the books and that he had concocted the fraud in conjunction with Eedpath. He contended that upon the evidence there was no proof of intent upon the part of the prisoner. He was a young maen in an office over which Redpath presided; it was his duty to obey Redpath; the directors of that great company had placed the most implicit confidence in Redpath;he had had power and control to an almost unlimited extent over those documents, and he had been allowed to continue his practices for yeaTs undetected by the auditors and theoboara. Suppose, then, thatERed-
th had told Kent that he possessed this stock, that he teldit in the name of Sidney, that he had a right to transfer it, and that he had a right to sign the name he assumed; suppose, too, that he added that he was doing no wrong. bnt that he was doing only what some of the directors had done-one of them to the extent of 100,0001.-what would the clerk naturally do when so addressed, and when asked in the course of his duty to attest the signature? The young man had been taught to obey and to respect MIr. Redpath, and no doubt ho would with perfect innocence do as he was directed. A thousand suggestions might be made to show that the attestation was perfectly innocent; and he was told that in stockbroker's offices it was the constant practice for attesting witnesses to sign documents of this description without being acquainted with the signature of the principal. Not a shadow of motive bad been suggested in this case which should induce Kent to join in a fraud of this description, and without an"iritent" proved there must be an end to the case. Moreover, it was not likely, if Redpath bad concocted these documents for the purposes of fraud, that he would have divulged his scheme to that young man, and have made him a guilty confidant without giving him also a share in the plunder. There was no pretence for any such supposition; but if the jury believed that Redpath had himself fraudulently concocted these documents for his own purposes, was it not equaUy probable that he should impose upon Kent some argument to induce him to become tho attesting witness ? The learned counsel concluded with an impassioned appeal to the jury to restore the young mank at the barto society with as spotless a reputation and as unsulied a character as it had been his pride hitherto to have maintained. He had earned for himself the confidence of those who foryears had had an oppor-
tumsy or Judgng 01f his actions. The good charagter vhich he had acquired had never yet been forfeited;* and, looking
at all the circumstances of the case, he trusted with confidence that the jury would say that the charge had not been proved to their satisfaction.
The followingwitnesses were called to character-namely Mr. John George Hammack, of Box-hill, Surrey, a ma' gistrate of the county of Middlesex, who had known Kent almost from infancy; Mr. William Henry Hawkins, a stockbroker and niagistrate, residing at Reigate; Mr. Gale, solicitor, of 49, Lime-street, city, vho had known him for 15 or 16 years; MIr. Sewell, residing at Clapham-rise, Surrey; Mr. Thomas Ventom, auctioneer, Throgmorton. street, city - Mr. T. Baddedey, solicitor, Leman-street, Goodman's-nelds;* Mr. J. Church, wholesae zrocr Eat cheap; MIr. T. Anse]l, surgeon, Bow; MrhI. B. Collingwfood, accountant to the East India Company, who had known
him fromn childhood; and the BRev. W. C. Izard, heid master of the Stepney Grammar School.
MIr. Baron MAnRTn then briefly sammed up. With regard to Redpath he said that he thought the jury could have very little doubt that he was guilty of the offence with which he had been charged. As to the observation of counsel that the practiceo of having stock in other persons' names had been resorted to not only by Redpath but by some of the directors, he must observe that there was no evidence whatever to justify such an observation. One conld imagine, however, why a director should have stock standing in the name of other persons for various reasons; for example, that he might not appear to be selling out stock, which might possibly create an alarm among people on the Sto:kkxchabge, and the directors might therefore sometimes have friends who authorized them to hold. stock in their names; but that was a very different thing from holding stock in the name of a non-existing and fictitious perso;
altogether, such as the supposed "George Sidney." With regard to lRent -the case was wholly different. He was not prepared to say, if Kent had lent himself to be an attesting witness, knowing that forgery was about to be effected, that he would not have been amenable to this charge- but before they convicted him they must be satisfied that he really knew and was aware of what Redpath was doing. If Redpath had said, "This is myaccount, but it wiU not do for my name to appear; I have therefore mrade use of the name of Sidney. I am the real Sidney, and I sign his name, and you must attest my signatare," sarely such attestation upon the part of Kent could not be caUed a forgery. It was no doubt a very wrong and irregqlar act; but if ho really believed that he was attesting a document for the transfer of stock which belonged to the principal of his offEce, and. which he held in the name of Sidney, he would not be guilty of forgery. To convict him of forgery they must be satisfied that he had acted in concert with Redpath, and of that there had been no proof. With respect to the witness CawkhiU it appeared that he was the attesting witness to two of these documents, and it certainly did seem extreraely odd that Kent sbould be prosecuted and Cawkhill escape, for CawkhiUl}uh
done precisely the same act as the other yoang man. When au attesting witness was charged with forgery it was the very essence of the charge that he should be cognizant of the crime that he was committing, and that he shouald commit it with intent to defraud. No such intent had been established in this case; 12 or 13 most respectable witnesses had given the young man as good a character as he could possibly have, and he thought that the jury were now quite competent to come to a conclusion upon the case without any further observations from him.
The jury, without quitting the box, immediately returned a verdict of Guitty against Redpath, and of Accquit as regarded Rent.
3r. Serjeaut BALLABrTyx said that there were other indictments for forgery against Redpath, which it was unnecessary to proceed with. There were also others aginst Kent, but, as he had noticed his Lordship's observations and the viewwhich the jury had taken of the facts against Kent, and as those which he should be able to prove in the other indictments were of exactly the same character, he should not proceed with them. There was, however, an indictment for misdemeanour, involving a great number of trans. actions in the office in which Kent and Redpath were cbarged with being engaged togother; and he shouald like to have an opportunity of consulting with his learned friends who were engaged with himin the prosecution as to whether he ought to proceed with that indictment. He suggested, therefore, that the matter should stand over titl the next sessions, Kent entering intohis recognizances to come up at that time.
Mr. Justice WIn.xS.-I think that you ought to have putyour best leg forward. I have read the whole of the depositions and I must say that I anticipated the result.
Serjeant B&LLANmX.-Felony is considered a " better leg" than misdemeauour. We always try the gravest charge first.
Mr. Baron MAnt2i;,-I had very great doubt myself whether there was any case to go to the jury. But take your own course.
Mr. HAWxL';S.-It is a fearful thing for a young man to have a charge like this hanging over his head for another month.
Serjeant BALLA.IiT-x.mThon, if my friend objects to my proposition, I must go on with the case.
At this moment Mr. BeckettDenison, the Chairman of the Great Northern Railway Company, entered the coart, and made an intimation to Mr. Ballantine, who thereupon 6aid that a communicationhad just been made tohimwhiclt he had received with much satisfaction. The responsibility of proceeding with the case or not had been left entirely with himself, and he willingly accepted that responsibilty and with. drew from the prosecution. (The announcement was re. ceived with unmistakoable signs of applause by the crowded court, and Kent immediately quitted the dock.)
Mr. T. ATXInsoN said that he had been requested to state that between 40,0001. and 50,000l. worth or property had been realized from Redpath's estate, and was now in the bands of the company. It was a larger sum than was involved in the defalcations which he had been guilty of.
Mr. Justice WrLLrs.-This is not a case in which a " sotoff" can bo pleaded.
M1r. Serjeant BALLrTMN&-It is a most monstrous as3rtion altogether.
Mr. Justice WILLES then proceeded to pronounce the sentence of the Court. He said,-Leopold Redpath, you have been convicted of forging a deed,-an offence of a most serious character, considering that people's property and their livelihood in so many instances depends upon the validity of instruments of that description. The mere fact of forging a deed relating to property is of itself a most serious offence. That, however, is not the end of the crime of whichyou have been convicted. You must, in the conrse of the forgeries and frauds which you committed on the Great Northern Railway Company, have led into situations either of guilt or of strong suspiion other persons who aro now suffering from your bad example and bad advice. I think it necessary, in consequence of a suggestion which was made by the learned counsel for Kent with reference to the part which he took in putting his name to the deed as an attesting witness, to say that this is a most irregular and wrong thing to do. He did it no doubt thoughtlessly, acting under your bad advice, not thinking what ho was about, and not reflecting that he was adding to a solemn instrument a lie written, signed by his hand. If any such practice exists in the offices of the brokers of the city of London, all I can say is that those brokers who permit it are far different gentlemen from what in my short experience I have found them to be. It is a practice which is much to be reprobated, and it may place in that dock any person who is guilty of it. It is a practice, moreover, as my brother Martin suggests to me, which ought to be avoidelI for another reason, perhaps not so strong, but stiU likely to influence those who foUow it-namely, that people who allow that to be done may be involved in liabilities with which juries will fix them in case anything- irregular should turn out with regard to those deeds. It is a praotice, with respect both to businese and to moral considerations, which is very much to be reprobated. Bat this is not the whole of your offence; because the frauds which you have committed in this case are frauds upon your masters; andunquestionablyfrauds oommittedbypersonsiusituations of trust, with salaries which ought to enable them to live in a manner such as personsintheir stationsof life ought to do, are much aggravated by the relations which exist between the employer and the employed. I will not do mora than advert to what was said by my brother Martin yesterday. I agree with him that frauds of this kind appear to be greatly on the increase ; and the reason which was su? gested by him was the first satisfactory reason to my mind borsuch increase that I have heard. It is that in these large companies servants are not brought into contact with their masters; they form no attachment for them; and they are not prevented therefore by any feeling of that kind from committing depredations. But that is no excuse for a servant
because persons who are not bound by the ties of attachment are equally bound with others to render honest service to those who employ them. Neither is this the whole of your offence; because in the conduct of your defence, if defence it can be called, your learned counsel was instructed to throw aspersions whollyunconnectod with the case in question upon persons who are directors of this company. I1 hose aspersions were altogether unsupported by any proof . iL deed, they could not been supported in this court, because ihey were irrelevant. I must say that I regard that as a very base proceeding on your part; and if it were possible to aggravate your crime I think that that aggravated it very much. You appear, however, not only to have committed a serious offence in itself, with circumstances of aggravation, but you have committed offences of the same kind upon such a scale and to such an extent as certainly prove that you are very far advanced in crime, that you are a practised hand, and that you committed crimes by which you acquired a large amount of property. According to the statement of your learned cotn-
gel just made, in order to show that your offence is not so bad as might be supposed, you had, when apprehended, some 40,0001. or 50,0001. of tangible property which your employers will probably take from the Crown to reimburse them for the losses which they nust sustain. Bat without that, and looking only to the facts in this case and upon the depositions, it appears that you have forged no less than 20 deeds. You have obtained by means of those forged deeds between 20,0001. and 40,0001., -how much more one may imagine from the state-
ment which has been made on your behalf. You are therefore a person who has forged on a large scale; you have played for heavy stakes, and you must have been aware ali along that if your iniquities wero discovered you would bs called to a heavy account. That account it is my duty now to close by pronouncing upon you the sentence of the Court, vhich is that yOu be transported beyond the seas for the term of your natural lifie.
The prisoner, who heard the sentence apparently withont much surprise, and whose demeanour remaiued unchanged, was9 then removed from the dock, and the proceedings of these protracted sessions were brought to a close.

Reports of the deputation of shareholders appointed at the last half- yearly meeting, held at Bristol in August last, and of the directors in reply, dated January 13, have been published, with an appendix, from which it appears that the deputation and the directors hold opposito views with regard to the management of the company's affairs. It w therefore be the business of the shareholders to decide the points in dispute at the ensuing half-yearly meeting. Considering the present position of the company, having nearly complet all its Parliamentary engagements, and possessing a wel organized staff, under the board of direcors, for the developement of the traffic on everv portion of the company's lines, it is to be regretted that anything shonld at present interfere, however weU intentioned on the part of the proprietors, with the exertions now being made by the executive to improve the position of the company and to developo resources which have cost so much money to brng into operation. It appears the directors have no wish to evade any responsibility attaching to them, and, of course, it vill be for the shareholders to consider whether it would not be better to aUow the board, as at present constituted, a little more time to show what they can do for the company.
The result of toh deputation of shareholders i stated in the following sentence in their report :-" The committee regret to report the failure of aU their efforts to bring about, in conference with the directors, any alterations in the constitution of this board."
EAST LANCASHIRE.
A special meeting of this company was held yesterday at Barv to consider the question of amalgamation with the Lancashire and Yorkshire.
Mr. DUGDALF, the chairman of the directors, presided. He said he had that morning received official intimation from the Lancashire and Yorkshire Company that the resolution in favour of amalgamation, which be now had to move, had beenunanimously approved by the shareholders of thatcompany. (Applause.) Noapparent inconsistenov in policy would ever prevent the directors of this company from advocating such measures as they considered for the benefit of the undertaking (hear, hear), and he had therefore no dfficulty whatever in recommending on this I occasion the union proposed. He had, in so doing, nothing to
retract respecting the CoIlne and radford Railway, as that line would havebeen absolutely requisite to secure a fair ahare of West Riding and other traffic to this company, if it had remained independent. (Hear, hear.) The proposed amalgamation entirely altered the circumstances of the case. The principle of amalgamation had always been acquiesced in by the East Lancashire directors, and it had for years past been one merely of time and terms. (Hear, hear.) The systems of the two companies concerned were so intimately connected that traffic agreements between them had for some years past been necessitated; and even in the midst of Parliamentary strife and litigation joint committees had been required to work the traffic to some extent together, if not harmoniously. If an amalgamation were'now concluded it would prevent the possible renewal of disastrous competition which would arise when the traffio agreements expired, in two years and a-half from this time,-a peried carcely more than necessary to complete the arrangement for union- and, besides the economy and avoidance of contests wAich would be secured, there would be a great facilitation of the extended accommodation for the public, which was now required, but rendered extremely difficult at those points where the two companies met, and with adverse interests intermingled and complicated arrangements. (Haar, hear.) The terms of the propobed amalgamation were so equitable as to render comment superfluous, for they were terms of perfect equality. The progress of the two companies had been side by side for years past, and while the Lancashire and Yorkshire dividend would probably be 5 per cent. per annum for the past half-year, the East Lancashire dividend would very nearly, if not altogether, reach that amount. (Applause.) T'he balance of advantages connected with this proposition, however. was infavourof the public, as the usefuines of both railways would be increased, wbile Parliameptary enactments and the fear of depression of trafc would alike preclude any attempts to raise fares and rates beyond reasonable limits. (Hear, hear.) Ho concluded by moving a resolution precisely similar to that adopted by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Company, authorizing the amalgamation.
Mr. RILxY, director, seconded the motion.
After some observations from Mr. Vance, Captain Harrison, Mr. J. Bower, and other shareholders, in favour of the pro sed amalgamation,
oTheresolution was put to the meeting, and carried unanimously, With applause.
The proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the ehairman.

PARR V. JEWELL.
This litigation, which has oscillated between the legal and equitable tribunals of the country for a verv long series of not less than 36 months, and has, in a new phase aud by way of diversion, taken up its abode in the courts of criminal jurisdiction, where indictments for fraud aud for perjury are now in full vigour and bloom, has at length arrived at its lIst stage-namely, that of costs in the Court of Chancery. It has been often reported in Tlce Times, but only in scraps, so that a connected narrative is still necessary. The bill was filed by Mr. Thomas Parr, who was the winner of the Goodwood Stakes in 1852, against Mr. Jewell, an insurance agent, and connected with the Exchange, seeking to obtain an injunction to restrain an action on of exchange. The facts out of which the quarrel arose are, that for several years prior to 1852 Mr. Parr was acquainted with a person named James Frederick Allen, since deceased, who was employed by Messrsm Phil. lips and Voss, solicitors, as their clerk, and in that capacity managed certain law matters for Mr. Parr. Among other services was the obtaining for Mr. Parr the discount of bills of'exchange to a considerable extent. Up to 1851 or 1852 these two persons remained on intimate terms, but shortly after tlsat dats, as was contended on behalf of Mr. Parr, though there vas great conflict in the evidence, a coolness took place between thent in consequence of Allen aDowing a gentleman who had accepted a bil for his (Allen's) accommodation to be arrested. According to Mr. Parr's evidence, after the 12th of January, 1848, he had only obtained from Allen the discount of two bills for 5001. each, drawn on a gentleman of fortune, and subsequently paid, and that all the other bills he (P.rr) had accepted were solely for the accommodation of Allen. Allen died on the 13th of Mfarch, 1853, having been for some time previously in ill health, as the evidence of Mr. Jewell declared. On the 7th and 26th of February, prior to his death, being pressed for payent by Mr. Jewell, to whom he was indebted to a large anount, to give security, he handed to his son-in-law, a Mr. Percival, Six bils of exchange, the earliest of which was dated in 1848 and the latest in 1849, as security, and obtained from Mr. Jewell two sums of 301. each. On the day of Allen's death the solicitor for Mr. Jewell commenced proceedings Lgainst Mr. Parr upon three of the bills, which, after some negotiation, were paid. Mr. Jewell then applied for payment of the remaing three, which, however, was refused, and Mr. Parr immediately filed the bill to restrain an action which had been brought upon them, partly on the ground that they were overdue when h ewve) meare possessed of them. A motion was made before Vice-Chancellor Wood for an injunction, but it was ultimately arranged that the action shouldproceed, the plaintiff a ndertakingto deal with the verdict as the Court should direct. lis Honour all along stated his opinion to be that the question was proper to be decided at law, and was not one which ought to have been brought into equity. The action was accordingly tried, and a verdlct, under the direction of the presiding judge, Mr. Justice Maule, giver for Mr. Jewell, Against whbih Mr. Parr tendered a binl of exceptions, on the ground that evidence had been improperly excluded. Before the bill of exceptions was decided the cause came to the hearing. but stooa over; in the meanwhile the Court of Error helf that evidence had been improperly rejected and directed a vesire de no0O. The cause then came on for hearing before Sir W. P. Wood, and, after four days of argument, his Honour directed the action to proceed, the plaintiff at law being required to admit that the bils did not come into his possession before the 7th and 26th of February, 1853. The action was accordingly tried, and there appearing to be some evidence to go to the jury whether one of the bills had not been paid at maturity, the plaintiff at law abandoned it, and there being then no evidence on thepart of the defendant at law to support the
le-s, the Chief Justice Jervis directed a verdict for Mr. J eweD. The case then came back before Vice Chancelor Wood, who directed the abandoned bill to be delivered up and Mr. Parr to have the costs of the suit as to that bil
and dismissed the rest of the bil with costs. There was an appeal from that decision, and after the appeal had been part-heard the Lords Justices directed the action to pro. coed, with liberty to the defendant at law to add certain pless, one of which was to the effect that Mr. Parr lad, before the biLs were given to Mr. Jewell, revoked Allen's authority to negotiate them. Another plea raised the question whether the hills had passed into the hands of Mr. JeweU at the times alleged in the answer. The jury, at the trial before Mr. Justice Willes, found a verdict for Mr. Parr on the first question, and for Mr. Jewell on the second, the result besng to defeat the legal title of Mr. JewelL From all this complicated mass of litigation (leaving the two indictments in their full vigour) the case came back to their Lordsbips to dispose of the costa.

GLYN V. LORD MORMNIGTON.
Mr. ROLT and Mr. COTTON appeared in support of a -motion on behalf of the plaintiffs, who are the trustees of the Globe Insurance Company, to restrain the defendant, the Earl of Mornington, from proceeding with an action which, as administrator of his son, the late Hon. James Wellesley, he had brought against the company to recover certain arrears of an annuity which had been granted by the company to Mr. Wehesley for his life. The short facts of the ease were that, for some years previously to his death Mr. WeUesley had been in a precarious state of health sffecting his mental powers, though he had never been found lunatic by inquisition. According to the evidence adduced on behalf of the plaintiffs it appeared that the accruing half-yearly payments of the annuity had been for some years paid to the solicitor of Viscount Wellesley, the brother of Mr. James WeUesley, and it was alleged that the snms so paid had been applied by the Viscount for the benefit of his brother, a great portion of such sums having been, in fact, paid by hinm to the physician at Geneva unuer whose care Mr. James Wellesley was residing. Upon these payments being made by the company receipts were given signed by Mr. James Wellesley, some of which were signed with his initials, and some with his name in full, and it was alleged by the comDany that they had supposed that the solicitor to whom such payments were made was, in fact, duly authorized by Mr. Wellesley himself in that behalf. Mr. Wellesley died in October, l&51, and his father, the Earl of Mornington, in the year 1S55, took out letters of administration to his estate. An account had been furnished by the company to the solicitors of Lord Mornington wivh respect to the annuity, which account, as alleged by the plaintiffs, had been adopted by the Earl, or by his solicitors on his behalf. Some correspondence took place between the solicitors of the company and the solicitors of Lord Mornington, and in the month of November, 1856, his Lordship commenced an action against the company for five year? arrears of the annuity. The bill alleged that the Earl supported his claim in the action on the ground of the incapacity of his son to give anyreceipts duringthe period in question, while, on the other hand, it was allegedthat the company were unable accurately to ascertain what the state of MIr. Welesley's mindwas during that period. The plaintiffs contended that if at law the payments made by the company under the above circumstances were not valid and effectual payments in discharge of their liability upon the annuity the company was nevertheless entitled, as against the claim made in the action, to stand in the place of Viscount Wellesley, and to be allowed so much of the sums paid to his solicitor 4s were expended by the Viscount, or by his solicitor, on his behalf, in providing for the maintenance and support, or otherwise in payment of the necessary expenses of Mfr. Wellesley, and on this ground they sought for the injunction.
Mr. SOUTHGATE opposed the motion on behalf of the Earl of Mornington, on the ground that there was nothing in the case which could not be tried at law; and that, in fact, if it had not been for the allegation in the biU as to the adoption of the accounts by Lord Mornington, a demurrer would have been filed to the bill for want of equity. lt was possible that Viscount Wellesley might have an equitable debt against the estate of his brother in respect of moneys aid for his benefit, but how such an eouitable debt could contended for on behalf of the cornpany it was impossible to conceive. The company had paid moneys to a person who had no authority to receive them, and upon receipts signed by Mr. Wellesley himself. How could the fact of that person having applied these moneys for the benefit of Mir. Wellesley give the company any equitable debt against his estate ?

COLXRMGE, WIGxITX(Y. and CR%O.t.)
Tbc Court this day proceeded with the cases ill the special
ALD}IANt AN;D OT}IXR V. 13ROW1,,
Thi6 case came before the Court upoz demlUrer to the defrda"t'S pleas. The action was brotightbythe,.aint.tl.
aI ttulees 1mdt, a deed exe'Outed on the 78tSf _I
1854, against the defendant, a subscriber of the deed, for a breach of covenant in not paying the sum subscribed by him towards paying the preliminary expenses of applyino to Parliament for power to establish a company to be cal&sQ '"The Swansea Docks and Mineral Valeys Railway Corn. pany." The second plea on equitable grounds aleged that the undertaking had been wholly abandoned; the fourth plea alleged that at the time the actiOn was brought the company was not provisionally registered; and the fiEth thabt the company had never been completelyregistered and that the action was brought for the benefic of the con pany, and for the purpose of enforcing a call.
Mlr. LusH, in support of the demurrer, contended thab the pleas were no answer to the action. As to the equitable plea, it appeared by the deed itself which the defendant had signed that the directors had power to abandon the underta= g. With respect to the fourth plea, the learned conisel said that under the 23d section of the 7th and 8th of Victoria, chap. 110, a certificate of registration only eadured for one year unless it was renewed, but he contended thab where the undertaking had been abandoned there was uo obligation to renew the certificate in order to support an action on the subscription contract. As to the fifth plea, this was not an action by the company against a shareholder for calls, but by the trustees under the subscription contract against a subscriber for his share of the preliminary enpenseg.
SMr. QUALS argued at some length in support of the
the.LuaS then replied.
Lord CAMPBELL said he was of opinion that judgment ought to be given for the plaintiffs on all the pleas. With respect to tbe equitable plea, his Lordship thought that if in this case a court of equity would have interfered to prevent the misapphcation of the funds the plea could be sustained; but It could not be supposed that, in such a case as the present, where the trustees were onlysuing to recover a sum of money under the Parliamentary contract to pay the expenses incurred, it would do so. This was a suit to enforce payment of expenses under the Parliamentary contract, and it was not suggested that there had been any misapplication of the funds. With regard to the fourth plea, pleaded as alegalbar to the action, theanswerw as com. plete, for the plea only said thecompany wasnot provisionally registered at the time the action was brought, but it appeared it was provisionaUly registered at the time the sUbscriber's contract was entered into. With respect to the fifth plea, it appeared that this was not an action by the company to recover calls, but by the trestees against a subscriber of the Parliamentary contract. Therefore the 23d section of the 7th and 8th of Victoria, c. 10, did not apply.
The other Judges having expressed similar opinions; Judgment was given for the plaintiffs.
- BUSINESS OF THPE COIURT.
In the course of the day some delay arose owing to the absence of counsel. One case was, in consequence, struck out of the paper, though it was subsequently restored.
Lord CAMPBELL said that if applications were made to postpone cases before the day appomted for the argument the Court would endeavour to consult the convenience of counsel; but his Lordship observed that when that was not done cases were called on unexpectedly, and this was not only inconvenient to the Court, but was also a hardship on the bar.
THE QUEEN V. THE RECOREDZE OP BRIGHTON.
Mr. WZLSBy moved for a rule calling npon the learned Recorder of Brighton (Mr. Edwin Jame., .C.), and one Joseph Palmer, to show cause why an order made by the Recorder, awarding the costs of an appeal to the said Joseph Palmer, should not be quashed The order had been brought up by certiorar. An information bad been laid against Palmer at the instance of the Board of Inland Rcevenue for using post horses without a license, contrary to the 7th and 8th of Victoria, chap. 53, s. 61. The magistrates at the hearing thought the case was not made out, and dismissed the information. The revenue officers then carried an appeal to the sessions, when the Recorder confirmed the decision of the magistrates, and made an order giving Palmer his costs. The order was made under the recent statute, the 18th and 19th of Victoria, chap. 90, giving costs in Crown suits; butboth the late and the present Attorney-General had
iven it as their opinion that the act did not apply to cases like the presaut. The learned counsel said the act only applied to *-es analogous to civil proceedings, and not to onminal or quasi criminal proceedings.
Lord CAMPBELL said, the learned counsel might take a rule, in order that there might be a decision of this Court upon the statute.
Rule nisi granted.

Comm7on .ury.)
PACE V. HODGES.
Mr. ML Chambers and Mr. Huddleston were counsel for the plaintift, and Mr. Edwin James and Mr. Maude for the defendant.
This action charged the defendant with negligently driving a horse and carriage, and runing over and injuring a httle child. The defendant pleaded " Not guilty."
The facts according to the plaintiff's case were these*The plaintiff's servant had charge of the plaintiff's children, who were out walking in the Peckham-road. They wanted to cross the road, but the little gir in question, who was onlv SiX yearS of age, obstinately broke from the servant's han3 saying she would cross by herself. The servant crossed the road and then looked back, and saw the little child crossing the road, and the defendant, who was the son of " Hodges best," was coming along in a dogeart, tnd was oUing out to the child. The efendant, however, did not Dull up, but drove over the child. The calling out appeare to frighten the child, and prevented its getting out of the way, as it tried to run back again, The child was picked up and taken to a surgeon's, and the servant ran home, and, having told what had occurred, went into hysterics. The defendant did not attempt to pull up his horse until after the dogcart had passed over the child, and then he pulled up at once.
The maid said, in cross-examination, that she was not turned off for negligence in allowing the child to cross the road alone, but she was discharged because she had such a bad temper.
Mr. Justice ERLE.-Do yox mean that you have a bad te sper, or that they don't knows how to manage it?
Witness.-I have a very bad temper. The child was always very obstinate when she was out with rne, and was very fond of running across the road by herself.
he plaintiff, as soon as he heard of what had occurred, ran in search of his child; he found her senseless, in the arms of a strange woman, He took the child home in a cab, and he thought, from the quiet state of the child, that there was not any danger; but in two or three hours he went to the doctor who had strapped up the child, and, having stated how the child then was, the doctor told him the symptoms were very dangerous, and desired bim to apply to is regular medical man instantly. The plaintiff directly caUed him in, and he attended the child for a long timo. Before the accident the child was healthy, but was now sickly, and had lost her hair. The defendant used to call and see the child, and one day the plaintiff caUed upon him, and he showed him alU over his distiUery; and when he had done that the plaintiffsaidit was strange he had not asked afterthe child. The defendant said, "God blems me, I quite forgot that, how is she ?" The plaintiffsaid she was almost blind; the defendant said, " Oh, never mind, I'll calland see her." When the defendant first saw the plaintiff he said he was afraid at the time to look round, as he expected to see the child's brains scattered about the road; that it had run back, or the accident would not have happened.
Mr. Stoko, the sugeon, stated that he saw the child on the night of the accident. There was a cuton the forehead on the left side, aud the eye was a little swoUen. lHe had attended the child before this. It was not a very healthy child. He had seen the defendant's attorney, and was subpoenaed on both sides. The loss of the hair arose from a cutaneous disease.
Mr. JAMES, at this staFe of the proceedings, said that Mr. Hodges, upon a distinct understanding that the money should go to the child, had consented to a verdict for 401.
Mr. C1.iMBERIS said, he might state that the moment that offer was made the plaintiff's attorney, Mr. Sherwood, had at once said that he would agree to it.
Mr. Justice ERLE said he thought it was very handsome on the part of Air. Hodges.
The Jury said they thought so likewise. Verdict for the plaintiff- Damages 401.
TYLEPR V. ODELL.
Mr. Serjeant Wells and Mr. Francis were counsel for the plaintiff, and Mr. O'Malley for the defendant.
This was an action for assault and for improperly g:ving the plaintiff into custody. The plaintiff was a marine storedealer, r i on business at Charles-mews, Paddington, and at Sudaury, in Suffolk. The defendant was a cowxeeper, at Pickering-mews. In Juneliast the p!iiuqff took rooms at Charles-mews of a person named Whipham, who was a tenant to aman named Hedges. He paidWhipham 41. odd forifixtures. On the 29th of October the plaintif paidHedgestherent, which wasdue on the 29th of September, DUt on the 30th of October the defendant and some other persons foreed themselves into the plaintiff's premises, and took possession. The plaintiff then removed the fixtures which he had purchased to Pickering-mewsv. On the following day the defendant and several policemen, accompanied by manyr other persons, went to the plaintiff's place, and the defendant said "I shall give you into custody for stealing my fixtures." The plaintiff said he had a receipt for the a,mount hie had paid for the fixtures
and he showed it to the defend.nt, who, however, toid thc
policemen to take him away, &nd he was taken, followed by
a rowrd of persons, to the Paddington police-station. The charge was then gone into, ane the magtrate dismissed the charge and ordered the fixtures to btken hack to the plaintiff's premises,
For the defene it was contended that the plaintiff was only a weekly tenant, liable to be turned out at a week's notice. The defendant found the plaintiff had removed fitures which he believed belonged to him, as he had taken these premises, and he went to a magistrate and asked for a warrant; the magistrate told him he did not require a warr.nt, but might give the man in custody at once, and he acted upon what he beleved to be the advice of the magistrate.
Mr. O'WALLEYwasmaking au attack upon the clerk of the plaintiff's attorney, when
Mr. Justice ERLE said he thovght the learned counsol was
going too far. He did not like an attack'being made upon a person who could not answer; but supposing the clerk to got up in court and say " This is a wicked calumnv, and I will chastise the man who makes it," it would be very unseesoly, but he (the Judge) could not prevent it when the man had been so attacked. The plaintiff's damages ought not to be cut down because the policeman had recommended him to apply to this attorney's clerk.
Mxr. O'(ArTxY said two actions had been brought instead of one. It was a harsh mode of proceeding, and must end in the ruin of the defendaniti e verdicts went against him.
The defendant stated that he had taken these premises from the 29th of i eptember, and he had asked the plaintiff to leave quietly, and he sntid he would do so. He after-
wards applied two erthree times to him togive up possession, bnt he sti remained. -Defendant then went -to a police-
and was I MnaAed q ga s afoicer pamed Garrett,
and he tola him to do what was proper. Garrett brolke into the house and took possession. There were there fdur AheTves and some other fixtures. They obtained the keys and lookedl up the place. He was af terwards -informed that the fixtures had been removed. The next dAy, finding the fixtures were gone, the defendant went to JiIr. Long, the ma"srate, for a warrant, but he refused to grant him one, saying something about taking him up for felony. The plaintiff never showed him any receipt for the fixtures, and he heard nothing of it until they arrived at the poHiceoffice. When they came out of the poHice-office he saw Hanley, the plaintiff's attorney's clerk. He heard him say to the plaintifl; " Has be gotany cows?I because, if he has, rill have every cow and every cow's tail he has got." The next day Hanley gave hima three writs.
CroEs-examined.-Had saidl he was sorry to see such a lot of rsgs, dirt, and bus i the plaintiff's premises. Could not now tell where iLaett was.

Mr. Sezjeant Thomas and a v. Williams appeared for the plaintif, and Ma. .r James, Q.C., and Mr. Prentiee for the defendants.
This was an action brouaght to recver damage for assult and battery, alleged to have been committedby the defendants upon the plaintiff. Onx the 4th of October last the plaintiff, who ig a plumber and glazier, went, with a friendI named Hackrett, also a plwmber and glazier, into the Three Crowns, a publichouse kept by the defendant Dawson and situate inx or near Fore-street, city, for the purps o?pro. curing some refreshment, To use the words of the plaintiff., " When we were in our third qurtr of gin I broke a glass." The other dlefendant, Bedford, who is the barman at the Three Crowns, askedi them to pay 7Ad. for t'he glass This sum was objected to as being exorbitant, and the demand was subsequently reduced to 4d. In the midst of the discussion Mrs. Da6wson camae in, aLnd, on learning the cause of it, calle the plaintiff "1 a .d- fool," upon which he replied, "If i were not for such fools as us, you would not wear suh nests and rings." Mrs. Dawson then sent for her husband, and o his arrival he knocked the plaintiff down, and, assisted by Bedford, beat hin, and turned binm out of the house. When ouat of doors he was so miuchillusedl that thepeople cried"11Shame!" Eventually he became the inmate of a hospital, lost the use of his eye, as he said, fromn the inuries inflicted by the de. fendants, and was otherwise seriously damaged. This was the plaintiff's story; but that of the defendants was widely different. According to their accunt, after having broken the glass, the plaintiff became very abusive, and callea Mrs. Dawson "a fne' fat madame" and "a fat b-." She thereupon sent for her husband,'who, with the asesisance of the barman, removed him from the house, without srkghmor doing him any damage whatever ; that after havng eentured uthe tried to comec in again, when he was prevented b a tboy an eevd the blow on the eye complained of, w4ch w however, was not the cause of his losng his sight~ inasmuch azshe had long been suffering from catarat or other disease of the eye

HlXLTABY V. TtRV(Vv
(Sittings in Banco.)
The Hon. Mr. DENMAuN moved for a rule to set aside aii award made in these cAuses, which were cross actions between a landlord and his tenant, on several grounds. It appeared that there had been acompulsory order of refer. ence made in each cause at chambersa under the Common Law Proceure Act by a learned judge, who thereby referred the two causes to a. judge of a County~ Court. The issues involved in the two actions were very complicated, anLd one objection to the award was that, though the attention of the arbitrator was expressly drawn to them, he had steadfastly declined to- pay any attention to the subject, observing that he knew nothing of special p leadng nd asthe parties got on inx the County Courts withot "ises"h
did,not see why he should not do so in the present ea'ses. Acting upon thisview the arbitrator had lumped both the actions into one a;ard¶ Instead of maingLdi two, and had made a general award, which was quite mnconsistenAt with the state of the two records, instead of finding upon each issue specifically. The learned counsel having also entered upon other objections of a purely technical nature,

This was an action for obstructing the plainxtiff's right to a watercourse. At the trial before Wr. Baron Bramnwell, on the last Northern Circuit, it appered that the dispute arose as to the right of the plainti, ito dain his house by a watercourse or drain under the house of the defendaur. At one time the two hous constituted but one, and the owner, having divided it into two separate dwellings sold one to the defendant and then the other to the plaintiff. The sysem of drainage seemed, as maight be expected, to partake of the "give andl take" character, for while the defendant drainedt his roof on to the plaintiff's premises the water s o received was ia turn passed, together with the 4rainsge therefrom, to the plaintiffs house, into a drain whichfMund its way into the common sewer under the defen. dant's kitchen. Under these circumstances the question was whether the plaintiff ladrighittothieuse of the last-named dirain, and could compel'the defendant to conistruct another for his use if he puit aside that.

THE JOSEPHT RO S0.-CR.TI.TrrnJ
(Befoere r. LUSMNGION.)
The bark (lanmire, of the burden of 246 tons, bound from Londonfor Barbadoes, and the bark Joseph Somes, of the burden of 774 tons, proceeding from China to London, came into collision with each other at 10 p.m. on the 29th of April last, a few miles from the Portland Light. The Glanmire, as she stated, was keeping her course west half north, making 4.J knots, with the wind moderate from north by west, and the weather fine and clear, when she descried theJoseph Somes right ahead, without a light, distant nearlya mile. The GLanmire instautly ported her helm, and in a few minutes perceived that the Joseph Somes. which was on the port tack, was keeping her wind, and crossing the bows of the Glanmire, which course she continued until she was a little on her weather bow, distant less than a cable's length. The danger of a collision being thereby rendered immediate, the helm of the Glanmire was starboarded, but before her sails filled, the Joseph Somes was suddenlykept away, her helnm, as it was alleged, having evidently been ported when very cloee to the lanmire, and too late. The consequence was that the Joseph Somes ran with great violence into the Glanmire, doing her serious damage. According to the satement of the Joseph Somes the wind, at the time of the collision, was blowing moderately from about N.N.E, and the night was rather dark, but not foggy or hazy. She had two ights ready to be exhibited when required, one of which was occasionally moved or flashed across the bows. The light of the Glanmire was observed distant irom one to two miles, upon which she exhibited her own light. On the vessels arriving within about a quarter of a-mile of each other it was discovered that the Glanmire was two points on the Joseph Somes' port bow, standing about W. by N., with the wind free. The helm of the Joseph Somes was thereupon put hard aport, iand the Glanmire was hailed to port her helmn, but instead of so doing she atarbearded it, and ran against the Joseph Eomes'bawse, inflicting upon her conisiderable damage. Cross actions wrere brought by the respective parties.
Dr. ADDASIS and Dr, Twrss were heard forthe Glanmire; the Queen's Advocate and Dr. Deane for the Joseph Somes.
The learned JUDG11 having stated the facts of the case to the Elder Brethren, by whom he was assisted, and conferred with them, said they were of opinion, in which he concurred, that there had been culpable delay on the part of the Joseph Somes in not porting her helm in time, the cQnsequence of wthich was that the Glanmire, in order to avoid the immediate danger of collision, starboarded her helm, andvwas justified in so doing. He must pronounce in favour of the Glantnire.
TIE ]FALCON.-COLLISION.
This was an action brought by the Imogene, an iron-built ship of the burden of 368 tons, against the screw steamship Falcon, of the burden of 468 tons, to recover for * total loss occasioned by a collision between them, at 3 a.m., on the 21st of September last, off Holyhead. The Imogene was bound from Liverpool to Pernambuco; the steamer from Cork to Liverpool. The Imogene represented the morning as fine and clear, objects being distinctly visible at a considerable distance. She descried the steamer distant from three to four miles, making fQt the port midships, A
signal lant6r was immediately exhibited, and she kept steadily upon her counrd, clote- hauled gx% the port ta9k etxpeetig that the steamer wotld past under her stern, ag she was. bound to do; but, instekd of sodoing,tthe steamer. approached -the Im9gens very rapidly under both steam and canvass, withoit any alteration of her course, and thereby renereda collison inevitable. The Inogene put ber helm hard sport, aLnd paidl off about two points, but the steamer, which had neither topped nor slowed her engines, improperly stkrboarded her helm and struck her so viLolent a blow that she sank before she could be towed intQ )Uolyhead. The steamer alleged in her defence that having teen the Imogene sixpoints on her starboard bow, distant about a mile, iz order to give her aL wider berth, as her course could not be distinctly ascertained, the helm of the seamer was slightly Darboarded; but in a short time it was discoveredthat the helm of-thelImogene bad been port,ed. By so prting theolmogene W~drendered a collision imminent, and,so farr as the F?alcon was concerned, inevitable. In order to lessen the frone of the collison the steamer xtarboarded her helm, but the Imogene ran against her, and did ber considerable dam_ge
Dr. Addams aLnd Dr. Twiss aLppeared for the Imogene; Dr. Bayford anid Dr. Spinks for thesteamer.
The learned Jumo, without hearing counsel for the Imogene_ said the FAder Brethren. were of opinion that the fault was solely i,mputable to the steamer.

Mr. Humphreys sald,-It will be in your lordship's recollection that when I last attended here I commenced a case with regard to a check for 4251. 12. 2d, issued by the guardians of the Poor Law Union of London in favour of the London Life Assurance Association. Two witnesses were then examined,-Mr. Heatb, who wasthe guardianpre. sent when the check was signed and issued, and Mr. Lovell, the clerk from the Bank of london who received the check, or rather, a rnote referring to the amount of the check,. at that bank in favour of the prisoner Paul. That check, your Lordshipwillrecollect,we had not been able to find,aL though no doubt it had been returned in due course by Messrs. Smith, Payne, and Company. I shall produce the counterfoil of the check, and also the minute of the board of that day, when it was ordered to be drawn; and with that and the production of the clerk from Meosss. Smith and Payne's, and the production, also, of a clerk from the London Life Assurance Society, to prove the non-payment to them of either the check or the amount, I shall cormplete that case, and ask for a committal upon it.
Mr. J. T. Rowsell, clerk to the City Poor lAw Union, said,-On the 17th of June last I was present at a meeting of the board. Part of the business was to pay a check for 421. 12s. 2d. to the London Life Assurance. I have no ecollection of the check, except from referenee to documents, but upon looking at the minute-book I have no doubt that a check for that amount was drawn, signed by three of the guardians, and countersigned bymyself,
Mr. B. Eldred under-clerk to the union, said,-I produce a counterioil in the check-book of a check for 425L 12s. 2d. I also find the words " london Life Asociation. Principal and interest."
Mr. W. B. Shurley.-I am a clerk in the Bank of London. I find an entr in our waste-book of 4251 12s. 2d. on the 17th of June last. It refers to a draught of John Paulupon Messrs. Smith, Payne, and Co. The amount was placed to the credit of the prisoner.
Mr. N. C. Henry.-I am a stcmkbroker. On the 17th of June I was a clerk in the house of Messrs. Smith, Payne and Co. I produce a book belonging to that firm, which contains an entry osi the 24th of September 'in mv writing of 4251. 12s. 2d. I paid that check to the Bank of London. It was the habit of Messrm Smith and Payne to return paid checks to their customers.
Mr. S. Giles, the accountant of the London Life Association, stated that that body had never received the check in question.
This case being complete,
The LORD MAYOR, after giving the prisoner the usual caution, asked him whether he had anything to say.
Prisonern-My Lord, I beg to reserve my defence till a futu-re occasion.
He was then fully committed upon this charge.
Mr. Humnphreys.-The next case will be a charge of steal. iD.two checks of the respective amountsof 771. lOs. 7d. and
7 17.9d.
Mr. Douglas, one of the guardians, said,-The two checks produced are signed bym m conjunction with others. One, which is dated the 22d of July, 1856, payable to Messrs. Collins and Hall, and addresed to Messrsm Smith, Payne, and Co., is for 771. 17s. 9d. The other, for 771. lOs. 7d, which is dated November 18, is also payable to Messrs. Collins and Ball, and addressed to the same bankers.
Mr. LovelL-I am a cashier in the Bank of London. I produce a book containing aentry eofa the receipt of the check for 771. l0s. 7d. The entry on thfe slip is, " Check, 771. lOs. 7d." The sum Was placed to his account.
Mr. J. E. Glanvile, another cashier in the Bank of London, said that the check produced for 77& 17s. 9d. he recerved by a credit-ticket, in the name of the prisoner, on the 22d of July last. The credit-ticket was in the prisoner's

Mr. B. Smith, also a cashier at Messrs. Smith and Payne's, said,-OR the l19th of November last I paid the check for 7. lOs. 7d. to the Bank of London, and plaeed it to the debit of the Union.
Mr.'Ahbis, one of the, guardians, said,-On the 8th inst. I found the twvo checks fq 7771. 17F. 9d. and 771. lOs. 7d. in the oSfice usually occupiedt by the prisoner.
Thicase beng now clo'ed, the p nisoner insnwer to the LORBDe MiyT asid he should reserve his defence for a
He wvas then fully committed upothis charge alo.
r.. Crawford.-My Lord, the prisoner bas a statement to Snalkein ahawver to these charges,isut undermiy advice he reserves his defence for tb4~present
Mr. Humphreys,-I shall now tae a new case, consdiing
of three checks, of the respective amounts of 1901. 5e. 44., 2001., and 29813s. 7d., payable to Messrs. Atkinson and Co. They were not Paid to that firm, but into the Bank of London to the credit of theprisoner, who kept cash there. They were afterwards paid -by Messrs. Smith and Payne, and eventually found in the iron safe.
Mr. Efliott.-On the 22d of May, 1S55, I was ono of the guardians of. the por, and with others signed the cheack for 1901. Os. 4d. payabl. to Mers. Atlinson.
M1r. Abbis.- June, 1855, I was one of the guardians of the poor. The two checks for 2001. and 298. 13s. 7d., payable to Messrs. Atkinson, were signed by myself and other guardians.
Mr. B. Smith.-On the 7th of June. 1S55, I paid at the clearing-house the cbeck produced for 200. to the Commercial Bank of London. On the 23d of May and on the 6th of June I also paid the two checks for 1901. Us. 4. and 2984 13s. 7d. to the same bank.
Mr. James Duncan, a clerk in the Bank of London, ald, -On the 22d of May, 1855, I received the check for 1901. 5s. 4d. on the prisoner's acoDunt.
MIr. Alfred Oxenford, also a clerk in the Bauk of London, said,-On the gth of June. 1655, I received the check for 2984 13g. 7d. on John Paurs account.
Mr. Humphreys said that the clerk who would speak to the receipt of the check for 2001. was at present an inald, and that he would produce him at the trial, instead of
sking for a further remand, if Mr. Crawford offered Lo ob'ection to that course.
Mr. Crawford at once assented to this proposaL
Mr. T. Martix.-I am clerk to Messrs. Atkinson and Company, drapers, Westminster-bridge-road. In 1855 they had an account of goods against the City of London Union. I attend to their cash tranaactions. I have searched our books,and the sm referred to in the three checks produced are not entered on the dAtes mentioned in the checks.
Cross-examined by Mr. Crawford.-AIl the money paid by our customers goes through my hands, I do not receive it direct from them, but it is brought to me by different persons in the establishment. A sum of 2001. has been paid to the firm by the prisoner, but not by the check produced for that amount. A summ of 2901. 5s. 4d. ws paid by him on the 21st of August.
This was the whole of the evidence for the prosecution, and the prisoner, who said be should reserve his defence in this casalso, was fully committed for triaL

At about 11 o'clockthat morning tEe carriage of " General Tom Thumb' was parading the Strand, opposite Somersethous, followed by a crowd increasing at every step. Mr. Robinson, who was proceeding along the Strand upon his business, suddenly found himself entangled in the crowd. Before he could extricate himself he&felt a tug at his chain, and almost simultaneously missed his watch, and saw the prisoner dart from the crowd and run towards one of the courts leading to Drury-lane. He rAn after the boy and caught him. Upon this the prisoner handed him the watch saying, "There is your watch, Sir;a boa toek it, and handed it to me." At the staion-house, howeyer, he admitted that he "snatched it, adding, "They wanted me to chuck it, but I was arid, as there wasn't any of my own pOals cthe fre.So I thto,ught I'd pve it the gentleman, and no

A detective was observed by the prlsoners to speak to one of the ladies, and this induced them to set off running in order to make their escape.

In consequence of the division of Royal Marine Light Infantry at Chatham being above its usual establishment, an order has been forwarded from the Admizalty to C'olonel J. A. Philips, Commandant of the division, authorizing volunteering to be commenced from that corps for the Royal Marine Artillery. The qualifications required of volunteers are, that they shall be of 'good character and possess general intelligence, and not less than 5ft. 8in. in height. The number of Royal Marines who volunteered yesterday 'was o2.
Sixty non-commissioned officers and men belonging to the dep6ts of the 8th, 24th, ans, 35th Regiments, at the Provisional battalion, Chatham, have been selected and placed under the instruction of Captain W. Nott, 83d Regiment, the Instructor of Musketry at Chatham, for the purpose of undergoing a course of instruction in the use of the Enfield rifle previously to their embarcation to join the service c*ompanies of their respective corps in India.
The board of officers which has been sitting at Chatham Barracks for the purpose of fixing the prices at which the several articles sold in the barrackeanteens at that garrison shall be charged to the troops, having concluded their labonrs, the authorities have directed that a list of the prices of the various articles sold in the canteen shall be placed in a conspiceous place in each of those establishments, so that the troops may ascertain the sum authorized to be charged for every article supplied to them.
The sailing sloop Star, 8, Commander Boyle, arrived at Spithead yesterday morning from the south-east coast of Anerica station. She sailed from Rio in company with Her Majesty's storeship Tyne, for England, on the 2, th Of November, and the English squadron, then under the com. mand of the Commodore for a cruise, consisting of Her Majesty's ships Madagascar, Indefatigable, Spy, and Siren. Hler Majesty's ship Cruiser, with two gunboats-the Haughty and Staunch-arrived from England on the same day. She parted company with the Tyne in a heavy gale of wind on the 9th, 10th, and 11th inst., from S.W. to N.W.I 160 miles west of the Lizard; she lost stern and quarter boats, stove part of bulwarks, and the ship is mu h strained. The Star has been the whole of her time on commission, consequently has been doing duty as senior officer's ship in the Rio de la Plata. She brings five naval invalids from Rio. The Star sailed the same afternoon for Sheerness, to be paid off.
'The ship Zerinidar, Captain Farber, arrived at the Motherbank yesterday morning from Bassein and the Cape of Good Hope. Date of sailing from the Cape, Nov. 20. She landed a mail and some passengers.
One of Mr. Francis's corrugated metal boats, employed in the ordinary service of Woolwicli dockyard during the last six months, having been subjected to sundry tests, in competition with other boats most approved in the yard, hIa been pronounced equally light on the water, much less subjectto capsi.e, and more durable. The report further states that the boat in present use there has been constantly exposed to the hardest service since July last, and is now as good as ever, writh the exception of some of the wooden mouldings being knocked off by being driven forcibly against the docks. She has had no repairs, not even paint, since she left New York. This is the same boat that was suspended with a ton of rongh stone blocks in her, and tossed about on the vharf, and run against the dock by four oarsmen for experimental perposes.

_ISi oAT PBjoa?_TED TO TEE CHIiU REPUELIC. -Her Majesty's Go-ernment are about to present to the Government of the Xepublic of Chili a lifeboat, in acknowledgment *f the valuable services rendered by boatmen in that country to shipwrecked British seamen. A trial of .this lifeboat took plaoe yesterday in the Regent's Canal D)ock, in the presence of Captain Stlivan, R. -, CB., the newly appointed professtonal member of the Marine Departmient of the Board of Trade; Captain lRobertson, E.N., Surveyor-General to that Board; Captain Walker, Member .of that Board; Captain Roberts, R.N., Mr. James Peake, .designer of the lifeboat; Captain Ward, R.N., Inspector of Lifeboats to tse National Lifeboat Institution; Mr. Lewis, secretary to itat society; the Messrs. Forrestt, builders of the lifeboat, and manv other gentlemes. The boat is on *the priDciple of those adopted and niow so successfully used by the National tifeboat Iustitstion. Ske u-as turned over by'meansof solnetackling attached to a crane. After having b,een turned keel,-up, she at once recovered her proper poei*tion, and freed heself of the water she thug shipped in less than 2Z0 seconds. These wondevful qualities of the boat ex-cited general satisfaction. So great-was the stability of the boat that it requiree the weight of 20 men an one gunwale -to bring -it to the waters edge, thus proving that it would be almost irnpossibled'or the boat to be capsired in a heavy snrf, yet, if such a caazalty should by any posdbility occur, *theboat wouf7d im..ediately right herself. With3 :0 men on board no water -could rueain in the boat, the same being -self-ejeated. On the whole, nothing could have been more ,satisfactory 'than this 4rtal, reflecting, as it did, much credit on the ingenious designer of the boat and her skilful builders. The 'I'nalitiag .of this class of lifeboat are as 4ollows.-extra buoyancy, aslf-relief of water, ballasting, self-rightin, atala;hty. speed, stowage, room, strengh of build. There can be little.dorbt that if such a lifeboat as this had beon in the place of -the Point of Ayr lifeboat she would not have upset. or, evon .if she had done so, that all or the greater part of &or crew wvould noer be living. We have been informned by a won.patenit authority that the whole of the Liverpoot Dock truatees' lifeboate, including the Point of A-yr lifeboat, possess few of the essential qualities of a lifeboat. Considering the quantity of rhipping that frequents that port, the heavy dues exacted from shipping, and the frequent wreoks in the vicinity, it is only reasonable to expect that the -hole of the dock trustees' noininal lifeboats slould forthwith be replaced by lifeboatc of tried and approved pritzeiiles. In the noble efforts which the National Uifeboat Isntitntion is now making to supply exposed points with iUiBboats of this description, let up express an earnest hope that the efforts of the society will be cordially seconded by the pecuniary support of the public. During the recent terrific gales its lifeLoats saved about 70 persons from fhipwreckg, Who can te1 how mary more, fromn the 200 or :300 poor fellows who perished on that disastrous occasion, might have been preserved tX their families and country if such lifeboats were iD sfclosst numbers oe the cost ?
The Tyne Steamer.
THE TYNES EEAMER.
SOUTHAMPTON, JOW. 16.
It is satisfactory to know that, whether the hull of the ship be saved or not, the greater portion of the cargo is already preserved. Three or four sloops have arrived during the day laden with cargo from the Tyne, the greater part of which is in good condition, and appears to be but very slightly damaged. They have also brought a part of the ship's [stores, and two lions were landed and forwarded to London this morning by the railway. The brothers Abbinett (the celebrated divers from Gosport) are at the scene of operations, and have discovered the source of the leak, which is at the sternpostof the vessel. Bulkheadshave partly been built round the damazed part, and it'is hoped that the flow of water into the ship well soon be checked. The tides are making off fast, and anything like active attempts to float the hnll cannot possibly take place for some days to come. All, therefore, now depends on the wind and weather. If the weather remains favourable, there is sonme hope that the vessel may be floated when the next springs set in; but should it change for the worse nothing can save her. Meantime, we understand that a portion of the men have been sent away, those remaining being hutted on the shoro to execute all the necessary preliminaries that can be carried on at low water.
As wil have been observed by the accounts already published, relatin to the wreck of the ill-fated mail steamer Tyne, one of tie most active and useful on board, and who throughout the whole trying emergency rendered the most valuable assistance to his fellow-passengers, both previously to and after their landing, was Dr. Acland, of Oxford. This gentleman was on hisreturn from Madeira, whither he had accompanied the Very Rev. the Dean of Christ Church (Dr. Liddell), as his medical adviser, in order to judge whether the climate of that island was adapted to Dr. Liddell's delicate state of health. Deeming that some particulars which came espeoially within his own observation might be found interesting to the general public, Dr.Acland has addressed the following communication to the editor of the Oxford University Herald:-
" Sir,-In answer to your question whether I can furnish any additional particulars of interest to those already published concerning the wreck of the Tyne, I must reply that the tale has been so well told by sonie of the London journals that there remains, perhaps, but little to be said. Yet, as happily few persons experience these disasters, the following incidents and remarks may be not unacceptable to some of your readers:-
" In the first place I may be allowed to say, and I am anxious to say it, that, having from boyhood taken the greatest delight in a sea life, and having spent, in one way and another, many months at sea in yachts and men-of-war, I could not be unobservant of tho manner in which the affairs of the Tyne were conducted during the passage from Madeira, whence I was returning, after parting with the Dean of Christ Church on January 6, and after spending the first six days ofthe newyear in sunning myself en the sub-tropical slopes of that paradise and enjoying the sight and taste of turtle, bananas, and green peas for those days at the hospitable board of Mr. phelps.
' I can therefore safely assert that, whatever be the cause of the sad accident which befell this splendid ship (and I have made a point of not endeavouring, before official inquiry, to learn the precise cause, even could the data have been obtained for making a correct judgment), I have never been in a ship where greater attention was paid to the navigation, and more saropulons care bestowed on the endeavour to eliminate al causes of error from the anxious and difficult circumstances which attend the working out of the position and course of a large iron vessel on long tracts of latitade or longitude. And, besides this, no one observant of such matters could see otherwise than that Captain Valer was a man thoroughly devoted to his duty, and more than usually scrupulous in his estimate of what that duty implied; and, further, I may add that his chief officcr, Mr. White, was a person whose courage and energy could not but give me a very high opinion of his character and the greatost interest in his welfare.
" Should this meet thoir eyes they will, I trust, excuse an opinion concerning themselves delivered by one who camo on board their ship wholly unknown by them and unrecommended to them.
" But I must say that I think we, the public, have blame in this and all similar matters. So much stress is now laid on expedition in al steam transit by sea or land that, practically, hours are often more valued than lives. Speed is attained by increased risks, and by increased expenditure of various kinds. The faster the public choose to go the more lives wiU from time to time be lost; and though we may, when accidents occur, throw back the responsibility on the professional men who have been thus goaded on, yet still our impatience of delay is at the bottom of the mischief in a great number of the cases. The old habits of seamanship, keeping well off lee shores, heaving to in fogs, waiting for pilots, and so forth, may be too antiquated for the days of steam and the age of hurry ; but as long as winds, fogs, currents, and reefs, and the ordinary physical and moral infirmities of men exist, these old habits, if slow, will still be at least safe.
"The papers tell us that this great packet company has lost nine fine ships, and I read of the total wreck, during my absence, of the Ostend packet under an old and valued commander when it was blowing a gale of wind at night. If we knew the hearts of all these and scores of other captains, how many would inform us that " their character was at stake-that, prudent or not, they must go ?" The fact is that the public generally do not know what the wear and tear of professional men in their several avocations reaUy is, or, knowig, they do not think about it. Each person has a want, this wantis to bo supplied, and the whole system becomes one of unhealthy and dangerous high pressure, doubled by competition, and little noticed while successful,* because familiar.
"Whether these remarks apply to the present instance others must decide; but, as a working men myself, I feel a resentment if a system urges on its agents, and then turns on them for the eonsequences, Employers should ever bear in mind that good professional men, especially soldiers and sailors, value, as a matter of course, duty first and their own life second. With what cireasmspection, therefore, is the standard of duty to be imposed I
'I declare my conviction, from what I saw on Tuesday of the officers of the Tyne, that they value their lives as nothing to their duty to the company and the public.
"By this I am led to the more pleasant task of considering how much worse everything might have been on Tuesday than it was.
"1. The ship, instead of canting round head to sea, might have stopped broadside on, in which case I presume every soul would have been washed off her.
"' 2. The passengers, instead of being confiding, patient, and cheerful in the many hours they had to feel the crashing of the ship before help could come, might ha7e been tronblesome to the crew, themselves, and each other.
"{3. The officers, crew, and servants, instead of being affable, self-possessed, communicative, and like brave men who knew their risk, and imet it, might haveomade our situation niuch more hard to bear, whereas Captain VaUer, Ps a man of sound judgment, encouraged us in procuring our usual food, in going where we would in the ship, and in possessig ourselves of such information as we chose ;-so that, with scarce an exception, everything was calm, reasonable, and as convenicnt as the case admitted.
" 4. No words can express the manly conduct of the two Tatchells, who first after high water came off after the heavy surf pes,nitted it, or be ore it was even prudent, with a letter from Mr. Jackson to the ship, offering help to myself by name, and to any other-passengers who could return in the splendid little cockle shell which had been sent for by a cart from Harbour Cove for the purr ose. These two men having been all but swaniped in conveying myself, Mr. Matthews, an engineer from the Braszils, and two others (losing one oar in the first breaker, and regaining it only after happily three seas passed under us without breaking), yet went off again for other persons during the next six hours, I think, six times.
"' Bath, the highly intelligent clear-headed seaman who was chief boatm an at the Hill Bottomu, Mitchell, from St. Alban's lIead, and Brown, from Kiimmeridge, with their respective crews, have been spoken of, I think, in the London papers; their conduct cannot be too much praised.
" Had Bath not come off instantly after he saw our rockets, and had we, in our ignorance of the coast and local ground sea, taken to the boats in the surf, it is impossible to conjecture how few wonuld have reached the shore. It was his local knowledge alone that explained to us that we must wait several hours till the half ebb, when the sea would probably moderate; without this, probably, aU would have pressed urgently to leave the ship when it was found she couldl not be moved, and mnany lives niiglit have been lost.
" And, lastly, I shall never forget the wise courtesy of the lady Augusta ard Lady Catherine Scott and their family (before Mr. Farrer's and Mr. Jackson's return); in inciting the peasantry, guided by Mr. Uphill, to make every arrangement that was possible for the conveyance of whatever was requisite to and from the respective localities provided for the ladies and children, the passenggrs, and crew, If that courtesy and Christian kindness, carried on as it energetically was by Mr. Farrer and Mr. Jackson on their arrival, ceuld be described, it would serve as a model for all similar occasions. I venture to say this hecause, being the first to reach the beach, and not having finally left the shore till the last men and the saved valuables had arrived, I witnessed all; wliereas those of my feUow. passengers who did not come till all was prepared for them can haidly conceive the unceasing readiness, energy, and good lhumou r of the people, even to those who carried the Preventive-boat that was stove in to the top of thcesliff out of harni's way.
"-It may help to convey to some of your readers the feelings which such scenes as this may impress on a man if I say that, as the last act of the evening, when more than200 had been fed and cared for, the Thanksgiving prayers of the Service to be usod at Sea were read in the stable by Mr. Farrer to the exhiausted men as they lty or stood on the clean straw, and that I niever wish to beer ring in my ears a happier and more cheering sounid then of the manly Amens' which closed this day-a day when, after the first event, everytihing might have been worse, and hardly anything could hbve been any better.

Wreck Of The Screw Steamer Briton.
WI?ECK OF .ZHE SCBBW STEAMBE BBPTOW.
SO'TEAMMosT, yInDAy.
By the arrival from Jersey this morning of the South. Western steamer, Captain Lewis, intelligence has been received of the foundering at sea, on Sunday last, off Cape Ushant, of the screw steamer Briton, belonging to theUnion Steamship Company of this port.t e
The Briton, underthe commandof Captain EdwardSearle, left London on the 5th inst. with a cargo of wheat for SeviUe, and experienced moderate weather, wind E.S.E., up to midnight of the 8th, when the Start light bore N*N.W., distant 13 miles. The wind then shifted to W., blowing fresh, and increased up to noon of the 9th, when a gale set in from W. to W.N.W., with a very heavy sea. The ship was labonring heavily, and was hove to on the moiming of the 10th, with close-reefed fore and aft sails. This continued until the 11th (Sunday), when it blew a furious gale from N.W.,with a frightful cross sea. At 1 am. she shipped a sea which carried away part of the larboard bulwarks forward, and stove in the port leeward lifeboats. About 2 the main trysail gaff was carried away, and at 2.30 the foresail was split into ribands, and all the sails were torn to pieces by the violence of the wind. The steamer fell off in the trough of the sea. and shipped another sea fore and aft about 4.40, which smashed two boats stowed away by the main cabin hatch. way, unshipped the cabin skylight and the companion of the engine-room, and partly filled the cabin with water. The fires were extinguished at 5, and at 5.20 the water was up to eight feet in the engine-room and to 10 feet in the after cabin. The vessel was, of course, completely disabled, and the pumps were rigged and continued working all day. It being considered necessary to lighten the ship as much as possible, about 10 tons of fuel and an imicense quantity of fire bars, chains, and other things were thrown off the upper deck. At 6 she shipped another whole sea, which completely washed the deck. A new jib was set to wear the ship, which was immediately blown away, and a new stormsail was also bent and set in room of the foresail carried away in the morning. The pumping gained on the water until about S o'clock at night, and then the water increased a couple of feet in the course of an hour.
At length, between 9 and 10 o'clock, when it was not expected that the Briton could possibly be kept from sinking above half an honr longer, a small schooner, belonging to Jersey, named the Wave Queen, bound for Hull with a cargo of oranges, &c., from Lisbon, providentially bore down towards the steamer on the port bow. The Briton's crew all shouted loudly for assistance, and burnt bluelights, when the captain (Blampied) of the schooner hailed to them. to lower their boat. He received for answer that they had none, on which (none of his crew being willing to volunteer for the purpose) the captain himself got into his little boat, and induced one of the men (understood to be his brother) to join him. This inspirited the crew of the Briton to lower their jolly-boat, and with four trips of the two small boats the whole of the crew were happily rescued, and conveyed on board the Wave Queen. The sinking steamer was then abandoned, in lat. 48.16 N., long. 6.30 W., at which time the stern was under water, the bulwarks only just out of the water, and the sea making a clean breach over her-in fact, she was a total-wreck.
The Wave Queen had herself sprung a leak during the gale, and the crew were aU kept to the pumps; but she hap. pily reached Jersey in safety on Wednesday morning, and will have to discharge her cargo there.
On their arrival at Jersey the captain and crew of the. Briton addressed a very respectful letter of thanks to Captain Blampied, of the Wave Queen, for the gallantry and kindness he had evineed towards them, and to which, under Divine Providence, they were solely indebted for their lives being preserved.
During Sunday Captain Searle broke two of his ribs by a fall, and has been left at Jersey under medical care; and two of the seamen were injured. There were 22 in all on board the steamer, who were all providentially preserved, but nothing else was saved but the clothing they stood up. right in. The crew remained at Jersey till Tharsday night, when they were shipped in the South-Western steamer, and arrived at this port this morning. They speak in the warmest terms of praise of the gallant ceonduct of Captain Blampi.ed ard his brother (a sailor on board the Wave Queen), who alone manned the boat to the Briton, when none of the others would make the venture.
The Briton was of 407 tons, and 40-horse power, and was built for the Union Company, in the autumn of 1854, by Samuda Brothers, of BlackwaU. She was, fortunately for her owners, insured so late as the 2d inst.

CORRUPTION OF POPULAR SCHOOLBOOKS.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-The education of the young lies at the roots of national prosperity. As a public guardian of these interests I submit to you the followtng Plain facts.
For many years avery popuLtr schoolbook, called Outaines of Zngfish Elistoy, by Henry Ince, M.A., has been extensively read and used in schools. It is impartial and instroctive,adnd wdell a9dapted to its purpose. The edition before
A nCew edition also lies on my table, with this titlepage, "Outlines of Bnglish History, by Henry Ince, M.A. Very much extended and improved by James Gilbert. London, James Gilbert, 49, Paternoster-row, 18.56."
I have been comparing the two editions very carefully, and have been struck with the ingenuity and number of the changes introduced. These changes all have one character, tendency, and direction-namely, to make a plain, honest, and impartial history do the work of a Roman Catholic manual. To give an iistance-at page 71 of Ince's original vvorI read Of Queen Mlary,-
"Mary had few qualities either estimable or amiable. igotry, revenge, and tyranny appear to have been her prevalirtng features. She was susceptible of friendship, and in many instances gave indications of resolution and vigour
In the improved msnual it runs thus *-
"From the peculiar circumstances of her position she has had the credit of but few qualities either estimable or amiable, and yet she was devotedly sincere in her attachneent to the Catholic faith, was susceptible of true friendsbip, and in many instances gave undoubted proofs of her resolution and vigour of mind."
In the original edition I read,-
" Contrary to her most sacred promises, Mary restored the Popish religion, and those who supported it in the late reign were advanced. Violent persecutions, carried on by Bonner and Gardner, commenced againSt the Protestants."
In Mr. Gilbert's edltion of date 1856 it reads thus :-
"M Mary was zealously devoted to the Catholic religion. As far as she felt safe in doing so she restored her faith to its former supremacy in England. Those who supported her views she advanced, though she professed to grant liberty of conscience to all. Violent persecutions, however, were commenced against the Protestants."
I might go over bo'th editions and show that in every instance where it seems possible the plain narrative of Ince is turned in Gilbert's to one governing account. To inspire a school history used in Protestant sehools with Pomanism is surely a very grave offence.
What renders it the more serious is the announcement on the cover :
"The present impression of 6,000 copies brings the sale up to 108.000. It is a gratifying faet to add that this is the only book appointed by the educational branch of the Society of Aits (his Royal llighness Prince Albert president) as tests for their examinations of the prize students on the subject of Englsh history. It is now also as the entire series under the sanction of HJer Majesty's Committee of Council on Education."
To place on the forefront of so perverted a history such high sanction is fitted to give the mischievous work extended popularity. Whether the Society of Arts has inter. fered or not I have no means of knowing: but I have good reason for believing that the Committee of Council on Education has remonstrated.
Where any Protestant character appears Mr. Gilbert's improved edition is sure to give a touch of its own. To Mr. Ince's character of Elizabeth there is added, "a mistress in the art of dissembling."
In the original we read:-
" The Protestant religion was established, and the Catholic bishops received into favour, except Bonner. Mary Queen of Scots assumed the arms and title of the Queen of England, and, being deprived of her throne, sought refuge inti ountry.")
In Mr. Gilbert's edition it reads
"i;eMary Queen of Scots, granddaughter of the eldest sister of Hienry VIII., assumed the title of Queen of England, and, being deprived of her throne in 1568," &c ' The Protestant religion was established by act of Parliameat, and the Catholic bi6hops deposed from their sees."
That nortion of Mr. Gilbert's edition wbictl rlates to Luther is worthy of Dr. Lingard, and in all respects a perversion, chiefly by Pdditions to the simple narrative of Ince. I need not multiply quotations ; I can only add my conviction that itis not fair to prefix the well-knowsn name of Inoe to a history so altered and corrupted. It is stil less desirable that a book so intensely Romish in its statement and colouring of facte should be sold under the very highest auspices, and bought by unsuspecting schoolmasters for the use of Protestant pupils.

THE P.FTVCES OF OUDE AT THE DIVDI-HO USE.
Yesterday the two Princes of Otde, now on a visit with the Queeti-Mother to this country on a mission with the object of which the public are already familiar, went to the EBst India-house, for the first time since their arrival here, ,and had an interview with the Court of Directors. The visit was p2rey one of ceremonv, and had no aim in conDexion with the errand that has brought them to England. They were attended by Major I. W. Bird and ColonelRawlinson, who have identified themselves with the interests of the Royal family during their stay here, and a numerous native suite, among whom the principal personage was Moulance MIusseeh-oodeen Khan Behaudur, Vakeel of thoe titular King of Oude, who is the only member of the family not now in this country. The names of the two Princes are lMeerza Atahomed Hained Ali Bahadur, a youth of 18, who is the heir-apparent and grandson of the Queen, and General MeerrzaSiLknndrHushmut JuWal Ali Bahadur, his uncle, and brother of the King. They arrived from their temporary residence at Harley-house, New-road, shortly after 1 o'clock at the India-house, in front of which a consider*ble crowd of persons had collected to see them alight. The Princes drove up in a carriage drawn by four grays and their retinue followed in private carriages. The costume of the heir-apparent, and especially of the General, was very magnificent. The former, wbo is a taU slender, youth, with a general appearance altogether prepossessing, wore a superb robe of crimson velvet, richly embroidered with gold, and a heas'dress having a deep border of gold, surmounted with a plume of black feathers. The General, his uncle, a man about 45, slightly lame, was dressed in atunic of crimson velvet, sparkling with gems in great profusion, and a cap of the same fabric, decorated also with precious stones.
The Princes on alighting were received by Mr. Kaye, in charge of the political department of the India-house, and by Mr. C. F. hopherd, nrivate secretary of the Chairman of the Company, and by them conducted, with their suite, to the Court-room, where General Sykes, the Chairman of the Court of Directors; Mr. I D. Mangles, ALP., the Deputy-Chairman, and several other members of the Court, awaited their arrival, including Sir Henry Rawlinson, Mr. C. Mills, Colonel Oliphant, Mr. Shepherd, Captain Eastwick, MIr. Prinsep, and Mr. Elliot Macnaghten There the Princes were formally introduced to the Court of Directors, and after an interchange of compliments had passed they were escorted by the members of the Court first to the ball in which the meetings of the Court of Proprietors are held, and then to the Museum, which contains an interesting collection of Oriental relies and antiquities. When in the Court of Proprietors they were shown portraits of the i Emperor and Empress of the French, which have been
recently presented to the Court of Directors by their Imperial MGajesties to mark their sense of the support the Court gave to the French Exhibition.
From the Museum the Princes and their suite were conducted to the Finance Committee-room, where they were entertained by the Court of Directors at a d4ijcdcr, wrhich was served ina styleof greatelegance under the personal superintendance of Mr. Bathe, of the London Tavern. Sir James Melvill, the secretary to the Court of Directors; Mr. Dickenson, the deputy-secretary; Mr. Kaye, and others of the higher ministerial officers at the India-hoase, were also present.
The Princes took leave of the Directors at half-past 3
o'clock, and returned to Harley-house.|

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-In the bankruptcy proceedings of the Royal British Bank, published on the 13th inst., I And it stated bv Mr. Martin that he was induced to take shares in that baink by fraudulent representations made to him by certain agents of the bank, mentioning mv name among the number. I also find myself accused of stating that the bank was in a fourishin- condition; that there was no possibility of a further cail being made upon the shares ; and that they, meaning. I presume, Mr. Craufurd and myself, knew that he had 1001. and wished to rob him of 150t.
Now, I beg to state, as far as I am concerned, this assertion is altogether void of truth. I did not mislead MIr. Mfartin in anyway. When he caUed upon me wishing to obtain his shares through the Lainbeth branch I positively declined to interfere, and referred him to the head office. All the information 1 had the power to give him was respecting the Lambeth branch, which was doing a profitable business, and which assertion is capable of proof. As to the state of the chief office, I knew nothing about it, beyond that I confidently believed it was not only in a solvent, but *m a prosperous state.
Mr. Martin signed a testimonial (a copy of which I beg to enclose you) in my favour, and I leave ir to you to reconcile this fact with the accusations which he has thought proper to advance against me, and I may add that the testimonial was signed by Mr. Martin without my knowledge at the time or my solicitation.
I would have sent this letter before, but it was not until yesterday that my attention was caUed to the report of the proceedings.

THE BISHOP OF EXETER.-A meeting of the
TE[E BiSHOP OF E ER.- A meeting of the parishioners of St. Olave's, Exeter, was held yesterday, convened by the churchwardens, Messrs. Husband and .Escott, "to consider an outrage committed by the rector, the Rev. R. Roper, on the parish by placing crosses about the church, contrary to law." Mr. Escott presided. It appeared that the rector had caused a huge Ievergreen cross, seven or eight feet high, to be placed
over the altar, besides smaller ones in various parts of the church, and these, together with other elaborate devices in evergreens, were allowed to remain during the Christmas festival. The aspect of the church is stated to have been more like that of a Roman Catholic chapel than a Protestant church, and considerable excitement has prevailed in the parish in consequence. The churchwardens made a presentation on the subject to the Ven. Archdeacon of Exeter (the Rev. J. M. Steverns), and the correspondence which had passed between the parties was read at the meeting. The archdeacon stated in a letter to the churchwardens that he " entirely disapproved what had been done in St. Olave's church, and was ready to take any legal method to do away with the cause of complaint. The law appeared to be quite clear, but he had thought it right to consult the ishop of Exeter as to the mode of proceeding."
lis Lordship's reply to the archdeacon was to the following effect-" That he is always sorry when any of the clergy involve themselves in disputes with their people about these miserable ornaments. That he once proceed against MIr. Parkes Smith, of Torquay, for putting a cross on the communion table; and, though he afterwards found reason to doubt whether he was right in his decision, yet he finds that it is confirmed by Sir J. Dodson in the St. Barnabas case; but as that decision is itself appealed from it is difficlt to say what is the real state of the law. Be this as it may, his Lordship thinks Mr. Roper was guilty of great indiscretion (unless the decided majority of his parishionerswere in favour of the decoration) in exdting the discussion in his parish. If the parishioners think fit they may institute proceedings against him, either immediately, or, as would seem miiore prudent, after the ultimate court of appeal shall have decided in the case to which he had referred. As he perceived that both the churchwardens have signed the memorial, his Lordship concludes that the minister has not, as the minister of St. Barnabas had, the concurrence of one of the churchwardes. This, in his Lordship's opinion, makes Mr. Ropers case worse; for h Lordship believes that the minister, withoutthe church wardens, or at least one of them, has not in strictness a right over the ornaments of the church ; but this is a point on which his Lordship does not commit himself absolutely." Upon this correspondence having been read to the meeting a series of resolutions were unanimously passed, thanking the archdeacon for the true Protestant spirit in which he had acted, condemning the rector for allowing the crosses, &c., to remain in the church after the bishop's disapproval, and resolving to wait, in accordance with his Lordship's suggestion, the decision in the St. Barnabas ease before baking any proceedings against the rector.
NOrINcGlAxM CEXERAL PouLTRY AssocTioy.- The first annual exhibition of poultry, pigeons, canaries, rabbits, and roots was held in the Mechanics'-hall, Nottingham, on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and produced a show that wi in every respect bear comparison with any similar society in the kingdom. The circumstance of the Crystal Palace show taking place simultaneously with the Nottingham one no doubt had an unfavourable influence as regards the number of entries ; had it been otherwise, they would have been unable to furnish accommodation for the birds which would in that event have been received. In some of the classes the Nottingham show by far exceeded that of the Crystal Palace, and as an illustration of this remark we mav mention the gray Dorkings, which were pronounced by thejudge the best he bad ever known exhibited. The class of Spanish birds was a Ivery superior one. The gray Dorkings which carried off
the first and second prizes were the most gigantic specimens that have been exhibited for many years. The white game fowls were verybeautiful. There was a splendid class of

STREET NONENCLATURE.
The report of the Commitjtee on By-laws and to confer
with Vestries and Districts boards on the subject of street nomenclatifre was brought up and reaa.
The committee stated that in their opinion the plan suggestedl bY Mr. Palling for facilitating the delivery of letters contemplated a much more extensive revision and reconsideration of existing arrangements with respect to the naming of places and numbering of houses than it would 'he expedient that the Board should adopt.
Mr. COLLINSON complained that injustice had been done to Mr. Palling in rejecting his scheme without granting him a bearing.
The committee recommended that certain houses should be included in the road caUed Portsdown-road, which road should extend for half-a-mile, and that beyond that distance a separate name should be given to the road.
Mr. H. L. TAYLOR was of opinion that it would be more consistent to take the suggestion of the freeholder in aU case-s than that of the leaseholder as to the naming of roads and streets.
Mr. D'IFF.yONGR did not wish it to be supposed that the naming of roads and streets required only the sanction of the owner of the property. In many instances such a rule would be impracticable, as the chief landUord was often inaccessible. an the present case he considered the name of Portsdown-road a most appropriate one.
Mr. CARPNEAEL asked by what means the new names of streets had been communicated to the newspapers.
Mr. D'IFFAINER said he had sent a copy of the list to some of the papers.
Mr. CARPMA EL thought nothing could be more unwarrantable. His own name had been freely used without his sanction, and he would repeat that it was most unwarrantable that any member's name should be used in that way.
Mlr. D'IPrArNGER wished to take the opportunity of stating that the insertion of the names of members in the list appended to the report was sugzestedentirely byhimself, and that no member ever hinted at or gave permission for the use of his name. If, therefore, any blame was to be attached to any one, it was to himself. He bad, however, acted in this matter without the least intention of giving offence, and he regretted that so innocent an act shouldhave caUed forth such severe remarks.
Major LYON could nAt consent to allow Mr. D'lffanger to bear the blame, if blame there ware, in the present case. As a member of the committee, he felt much indebted to Mr. D'Iffanger for the great trouble he had taken in this matter. But, for hi3 own part, he regarded the warmth which had been displayed on this occasion very much in the light of a hurricane in a duck-puddle. (Laughter.) No new names had been given to streets; the report merely contained suggestions.
The committee were of opinion that the letter of Sir T. Tancred, which had been addressed to the Board on this subject, contained some valuable suggestions deserving consideration, whenever any general system of numbering houses and naming streets should be adopted.
The committee also were of opinion that it was desirable certain modifications in regard to regulating the width of streets and alleys should be adopted.
Onathe motion of hlr. WruussONSO% the report was received and agreed to.
PUBLIC PARKS FOR TliE METROPOLIS.
Mr. 'WRI(;HT brought up the report of the Committee of Works and Improvements on the subject of providing parks for 'he use ana recreation of the inbabitants of the metropolis. The report, in substance, stated that in the opinion of the committee it was desirable, for the better sanitary condition of the metropolis, and for facilitating the means of healthy recreation for the publc, thrt parks should be established in certain parts of the metropolis hitherto neglected in that respect. That the part most urgently requiring such an improvement was the south-eastern portion of the umetropolis. That they considered thesites proposed at Rotherhithe and Bermondsey were both eligible, but they thought that a site consisting of a portion of each of those suggested might possibly be preferable to either considered singly, and that the determination of the site to be actuaUy adopted would, to a great extent, depend upon the practicabilty of effecting advantageous arrangements with the proprietors of land. That the expense of makiug the park proposed at Rotherhithe had been estimated by its promoters at about 40,0001., and that of the park at Bermondsey at about 6(,0001.; but the cornmittee had not sufficient evidence before them to enable them to test the accuracy of either estimate; at the same time they considered that the cost of forming a park of adequate dimensiona for this locality would not be less than 100,0001. They recommended, with regard to the mode of meeting this expenditure, that an application should be made by the Board to Her Mlajesty's Government to contribute a portion of the amount, in conformity with the couxse which had already been adopted in the case of the Finsbury park. The committee were of opinion that the next park in point of urgency was that proposed for Finsbury. That so much of the ste proposed for the park at Finsbury as lay to the west of the Green-lanes or Sontbgate-road, and which was estimated to contain about 230 acres, was eligible for a park, but they considered that in any bill 'which might be introduced into Parliament powers should be taken enabling the Board to appropriate for building purposes a portion of the site, not exceeding 80 acres. lat the cost of the site for Finsbury-park, as above defined, was estimated by the promoters at about 160,0001. - the committee, however, considered that that amount would be exceeded, but that the actual cost would probably not be more than 200,0001., of which it had been represented to the Board that the Government would contribute 50,00(V.
The committee were further of opinion that, considering the advantages which Hampstead-heath presented for promoting the health and recreation of the inhabitants of the metropolis, and its value, from the beauty of its site, as an ornament to the capital, and considering also that the acquisition of the site of the heath and of such adjoining land as it might be desirable to connect therewith would, if the purchase thereof were delayed, involve a very much larger expenditure than would bo required at the present time, it was important that the heath and the adjoining laud above referred to should be purchased
for the public use at as early a period as possible. That the exponseof purchasing the heath and the adjoining land, comprsed in the plan of the memorialists, was estimated by the promoters at about 100,0001. t te committee were of opiion that a portion of land not included in the plan of the memoriahists, comprising Traitor's-hill, might
th great advantage to the public be comprehended in the proposed park, and that with such addition the outlay would probably amount to between 150,0001. and 200,0001. ; that the committee were of opinion tbat the Board had a rig to expect that a considerable portion of the expense of the Hampstead purchase should be defrayed out of the public funds, and they recommended that application be made to the Government for that purpose ; and they further recommended that powers be takenin anybiUl to beapplied for for rppropriating sites of land for building purposes, semilar to those suggested in the case of the Finsbury-park; That the recommendations as to the appropriation of building sites, if acted on, would materially reduce the expense of forming the parks in question, That wilh reference to the means of raising money to purchase land for parks, the committee, considering that the rest of the metropolis had been provided with parks by the Government, submitted it would not be fair to make those districts pay mo-t which had hitherto been most neglected, and that it was more reasonable to look upon the parks now suggested as the completion of a metropolitan improvement, and that, apart from any grant which might be made by the Government, the whole metropolis should equally bear the expense.
The report having been received,
Mr. WsoierxT moved that the report be printed and distributed, accompanied with plans, and also a plan of the metropolis showing the sites of the present and of the proposed parks.
Mr. WAtRE seconded the motion, which was put and agreed to.
Mr. WRIGHCT then moved that the report be taken into consideration on Tuesday week.
Mr. SAV,AGE seconded the motion.
Mr. HAIVIEKS did not think that would afford sufficiert time for the ratepayers of the metropolisto consider the subject i he therefore would move, as an amendment, that the consideration of the report be deferred till Tuesday fortnight. The Board were about to engage in the expenditure of upwards of half a milion of money ; time therefore ought to be afforded to consult their constituents on the matter.
Mr. H. L. TAYLOR was of opDinon that time should be given to ascertain whzt were the feelings of the ratepayers with regard to the heavy taxation which the Board seemed determined to impose upon them. It should be borne in mind that up to the present moment the public had not been caUed upon to pay a single shilling towards those vast sums which had been voted to be expended by the Board. Time should be given to know whether they were willing to
pay no haf amillion merely, for the formation of parks, ou oetan double that sum (for, in his opinion, it would amount in the result to nearly twvo millions) before they camne to any final decision on the subject.
Mr. D'IFFANGER heped it would not go forth that the cost of the new parks would double half a million. The committee had gone into the expense very minutely, and his opinion was that the cost would be much less than half a mlinon. That Mr. Hawk-es should object to the formation of these parks was not a matter of surprise, seeing that he resided at Kensington, where his constituents were already provided with a park and all its accompanying ad. vantages.
The original motion was then put and negatived.
The amendment that the consideration of the ieport be on Tuesday fortnight was then put as the original motion
Mr. Deputy HEuARnsoN thought time should be given to the district boards to consider the question ; he therefore moved as an amendasent that the report be taken into consideration on Tuesday month.
Mtr. SIIAW seconded the amendment.
A very lengthened discussion then arose, each member availing himself of the opportuaity to deliver his opinion on the merits of the main question as to the formation of parks in the vicinity of the metropolis.
The amendment was put and negatived. Several other amendments were also proposed and negatived, and tho motion that the report be considered on Tuesday fortnight was finally agreed to.
AMIr. VWRIGHIT then gave notice that on Tuesday fortnight he should move that immediate measures be taken for the establishment of two parks, one in the south-eastern and one in the northern parts of the metropolis, as recommended by the Works Committee, and that, aparS from any contribixfiontobe obtained from the Government, the expenses be qual?y assessedupon the whole metropolis; that the Govermntent hocommunicated with to ascertain if they will loin .mth t,he Board in the purchase of Hampstead-heath, ind.te what extent.
2rEW. £ZLETS IN SOUTIlWARK AND COVENT-GARrIE.
rejm.t or the committee, stating the steps they had
taken relative to the prosecution in Parliament of a bill .- lating to the new streets in Southwark and Covent-garden,. was then brought up, and, on the motion of Mr. TwtxKR,. was received.
Mr. Row.s asked whether power was sought to deg with rninons houses, especially those in Stanford-street,
The CHAisitLsN said the question was a very important-, one, no doubt, but Parliament would be very careful beforethey declared when a man was incapable ox managing his owvn property; and it was very difficult to say where a man's, insanity began and where his sanity ended.
Mr. Tumi.ER said the committee had not been instructeo, to insert any clause relating to the sabject.
Mr. EHAWKEs expressed his strong disapprobation of,
clauso 5 in the draught of the bill, which he believed would. have the effect of delegating to a committee aU the powersof the Board in regard to the construction of the new streets.
MIr. TuRNzR assured the hon. member that the biU would not delegate any power to the committee beyond that of: investigating matters of detail.
MIODES OF COMMUrNCATION (INCLlUhING BRIDGES) IN THP.
3IMTROPOLIS.
Mr. Deputy HARRmT moved that it be referred to the Works Committee to inquiro into the state and condition, of the several communications in the metropolis, including. the bridges over the Thames, and the approaches thereto,
and to report whether the communications and approaches. were adequate to the present and increasing traffic ; if not,
the best mode of improving the same. Re wished the zeference to the committee to be very general, and to ask: them to report only on facts. There would be in the nextsession of Parliament an extraordinary number of appli. cations by railway companies for powers to interfere with. the metropolitan thoroughfares; and what he thought to be most desirable was that a committee should be required to watch the proceedings of thosacompanies, to ex:amine the nature of their applicajizs, and ascertain whether some improved modo of accommoda. tion to the public might not be secured. It was one of the first duties of the Board to consider the thoroughfares off the metropolis, and he thought a more favourable opportunity than the present would not again present itself for that purpose.
Mr. WILKLISON seconded the motion.
Major LyoN did not oppose the motion, but he shoul4 object to the committee making partial reports. The Board ought to know at once aU that they would have to deaL. with.
Mr. HAW%VItES objected to refer tho question to a com-. inittee at alL The practice the Board was adopting would. ultimately throw the whole business of the Board into the hands nf a few persons. It was altogether upsetting the act of Parliament and undermining the principle of selfgovernment.
Mr. Alderman Cuislrr, XP., supported the motion, ana thought it was a great defect in the proceedings of the Board. that matters of minor inportance were discussed in a whole Board, instead of being referred to a committee.
The motion was then agreed to.
PUBLIC CO:llPETITION FOR DESIGNS.
On the motion of Mr. WRsIGIrT, seconded by Mfr. Wil-. liINSON, it was resolved,-" That prizes be offered for public competition for designs showing the best mode of layine out the surface and sub-soil of the new street in Southwark, as an example of a first-class street, and also for the street in Westminster, as a second-class street; showing the disposition of tho private vaults, sewers, gas and water pipes, telegraph wires, with any parts of the soU appropriated to other useful purposes. Prizes-1st class street, 100 guineas; ditto, 50 guineas; ditto, 10 guineas: 2d c'ass, 50 guineas; ditto, 2(W guineas; ditto, 5 guineas; and that the details of this competition be carried out by the Wores Committee."
Mr. WrIGsiT presented a memorial from persons engaged ht beating and ventilating buildings, numerously signed by persons engaged in that profession, complaining of certain. clauses of the New Building Act.
Mr. CRELLIN gave notice of the folowing motion:-
Tnat the ?IMetropolitan Local Management Act having restricted the power of thb Comnmissioners of Works to tbe apProval or non-apDroval of any plan submitted to them by this Board for preventing all or any part oe the sewage of tbe metropolis from flowing or passing Into the river Thames In or near themeatropolis,' the course ~nr,ned by the Pirst Commissioner of Woriks in directing Ciaptain t(alton and Messra.

A large and influential meeting of the electors of the western division of the county of Kent Was held atthe Bull Hotel, Maidstone, on Thursday, for the purpose of determining what measures ought to be taken to secure the return of htr. C. Wykeham Martin as one of the representatives of the county in the room of the late Sir E. Filmer. Mr. H. Bannerman was called to the chair and was supported br Mr. C. Wykebam Martin, Mr. J. Whatman, M. P., Mr. 7.. Leo, MP., Mr. H. Mildmay (candidato for the representation of alaidstone at tho next general election), Mr. G. Warde Norman, Mr. Francis Bennoch, Mr. F. Dashwood, Mr. HL K. lugessen, Captain Baker, and a large number of the county magistrates and tenant-farmers of the western division of Kent.
Mr. MAnRTL, at considerable length, entered into a statement of the reasons which had induced him to come forward, and of his political opinions generally. He said ho should support, if elected, any measure that was calculated to secure the final settlement of the church-rate question on fair and equitable terms. He also advocated reforms in the army, navy, law, and civil service, and a large extension of the frauchise. The income-tax he looked upon as requiring considerable modification, and he thought tha e Govcrnment ought to leave it to the option of Parliament whether they would continue the additional tax imposed on account of the wa. for another year or not. He was also of opinion that something ought to be done to provide thc means of satisfactorily disposing of our criminal population, transportation having practicaly ceased, and he advocated as one step in that direction the establishment of reformatories, which he said had been successfully tried on the continent of Europe and in America.
At the close of Mr. Martin's speech numerous questions were put to him by the electors present, which elicited from him a statement that he was opposed to the vote by ballot, on the ground that the non-electors ought to be made acquainted cwith the manner in wliich those who possessed tho ran hise exercised their electoral privileges. T believed that both the advantages and disadvantages of the ballot. bad been greatly overrated. Ho would, however, be ready to support any measure calculated to render the laws against bribery and intimioation more effectuaL He wouldnot vote for the abolition of tho grant to Maynooth, because he believed that if it was withdrawn this country would com, mit a breach of faith with Irel%nd.
Resolutions were then passed unanimously expressing the confidence of the Liberal electors in Mr. Martin, and pledging the meeting to promote his return. A further resolution was also agreed to, to the effect that the meeting, in the present state of the political world, felt strongly the propnety of returning as their representative a gentleman who would give a cordial, though independent, support to the, Government of Lord Palmerston rather than one who would. do all in his power to place a Ministry in offices elected from. the ranks of the Opposition.
A committee, consisting of several Liberal members of Parliament and a large body of the influential electors of West Kent, was appointed for the purpose of conducting Mr. Martin's election, a nd it was stated that Mr. Marti
intended before the day of election to address meetings of the electors in the principal districts throughout the western division of the county.
A meeting of the supporters of Sir Walter Riddell, the Conservative candidate, has been convened for Thursdag next in Maidstone.
SALFORD.
On Thursday evening a meeting of the electors of Salford, favourable to the election of Mlr. Alderman Langworthy, took place, at which a requisition containing 1,350 names was presented to that gentleman. Sir Elkanab Armitagpresided. Mr. Langworthy was received with much cheering, and gave long explanation of his views upon various. political matters. He said he was a firm advocate of Freetrade, and had beena so all his lfe. He noticed the good. effects which had arisen from the repeal of the navigation. laws; and, proceeding to the subject of education, said that; the voluntary srstem had done what had astonisbed its owr supporters; but it was desirable to do mnore than the voluntary system had done. He would support a local rate for education under local management; and advocate a system. very simiar to that agreed upon w hea Sir John Paknmgton visited Manchester. That was a compromise made between. the two educational bodies in Manchester; it was mado upon a liberal basis. There were many questions of reform before us, such as the reform of the law of the land, and. the cheap administration of Justice to the people, and,
most important of all, perha , they would - ,, tlm t Of reform in Parliament. The Ellorm Bil, when it passed,
not a perfect measure; and now, when education had so faf advanced, and the country had increasod in population and. wealth, it was by no moans the sort of measure we wante(r for the true representation of the peolle. (Hear, hear.). The franchise must and ought to be greatly extended; the existing test did not include suffiiently tho intelligent aud educated Classes, and it would be necessar to formi othertests by which they might secure the privlIege. The property test might with Advantago be lowered; but he was not prepared to say to what degree. Mr. Langworthy, in. eonclusion, avowed himself to be a supporter of vote bye ballot, and said he should support every measure which he believed to be for the good of the country. he business concluded by a resoluti'on pledging the meetinz to use everp exertio,n to aecaxo Mr. Lngworthy's return,
