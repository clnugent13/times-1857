It is a part of the policy of the Russianstospesk' of peace as'being sertainly the issue of the' Conferences, and the object evidently is to raise expectation so highL as to render any other conclusion difcult. Indeed, as it is, the public, can hardly think of any other; and of the many persons with whonh one converses on this all-engrossing topic, there are few indeed who do not confidentjy eLxpectthat -a treaty of peacew'llspe ydil terinate the laboug of the Congress. ' - As to the Emperor of the Freifch himself, -it is easy to understand how pleased he would! fee] if t'he interesting 'cvent of the Empress's aecoze1zemen1 should boe piceded-by the announcement of peace. His Majemty 'is natrally sensitive on every question relatinig.o his _dynasty, and he would feelj keenly anyymiptom of coldness at the tidings of the birth of a- Prince. -AU1 'the signs of external rejoicing that could be iimagined would be no compensation ; and, he-may apJprehend that an event on w9ickh he sets so much importance as the birth of -n heir' might: be- receAved<with indifference while, uncer-, ta int stil hung over the result of the Confe,rences. That the prOclaination of a treaty of peace should immediately' precede, or De - concurrent, wjt1i the bthe'r ainouncemefit, would be a triumph. indeed; buit-it is equallyfor the interest of England and Fr-neetlhat tnisstate of uncertainty should be putai end to, and the wish oft this Goverment to do so is shared, as Ihave reaswn to believe, by its allies. At 'all events, I have the best autho'rity for stating that the progress of the negotitions will, from this day. forward, be more rapid than was at fist supposed, and it-niay therefore be fairlyinferred'that _some important questions have alteady been decided. - I the aeantime the Plalipotentiaries appear in every society where' they are invited, and' Count 03Ilof continues to be, I will not say the adaired of all admirers, but certainly the observed of all ohservers. The momenthemniakeshis appearance in. a saloii he is sure to be the centre of .a numerous group of both sexes, who scan every feature and watch every expression of his countenance. Commanding ii person, he stands'without swerving the artllery of the many eyes, many of them brilliant ones, that are pointed at him, and so watchful is the curiosity of the beholders that many of the re- ports one finds floatingthefollowing day'iay be I traced to inferences hastily formed after such a scrutiny. The' hero of the moment, whose name awvakes associations of zo pecular a Ind, bears himtself well through theordeaL His high.forehead, from which the iron-gray hair is only half pushed. aside, but not carelessly; the regular and marked features of which sternness seenms to beL the most prominent characteristic, the long and thick mona.. tache, and' last, not 'least, the costly- diamonds I which compose the three stars which decorate his left breast, and 'which might. make the D-lwe of Brunswick himself grow pale (if anything could produce such an effect), all. mark him out as the object of curiosity.. He, seldom smiles, or if he does, his smiles, the moment they appear, hide themselves in the hair' of his upper lip, as if ashamed to be seen at play on a counteniance cast -in so- stern- a mould.- He'. is perfectly easy: in his manner, and, whether his interlocutor be man or woman, is still grimly polite 'with all.

(PRoxMoOur oWN oOnasOlDslc.) *:i CAMPEC BEFORE SlBRSTOPOL, izs. 23 The bayonets of 46 British battalions bristled yes,terday 'upon T,elgraph-hill, an elevated ridge,'of the plateau, overlooking the valley of the Tcheritaya. 20,000 infantry were there assembled for i]nsp,ction and review -by the C,ommander-in-Chnief The morning was so cold, that. some who impatiently awaited the spectacle, feared -it would- be' -aain postponed, but the earth and air were dry, and after church service the divisions were -seen marchmg from 'heir camps in the direction of the parade ground,.where numerous spectators.soon began to assemble. A better piece of ground cbuld hardly be selected for either a training galop or the' reviewof an army. The soilwas firm withbutlardness, and affordedpleasant and elasticfooting to' the gathering cohorts and to the' horses of cuiiious:aniid interested gazers.. As the troops marched up, the. pioneers. busied themselves 'with filling: the small circular trenches where tents b3ad formerly stood; andj when the review was 6verF, the vwhole surface had' been tro'dden by hoof and foot as level as a bowlinggreen. The windblew -keenly from the north, and. it was sharp.workfor faces, feet, and fingers upon Telegraph-hill that'day. The pedestrians' had. perhaps-the-best of it, for they could keep up the circulation by exercise, while halffrozen horsermeu were clatteiing. their boos ag,ainst the stirrup irons in vainattemptsto restore sens#tion to. their benumbed toes. Cold, however, was soon forgotton in the, animation and interest of -the soene. Even' before the troops had formed -their line, -there was much to amuse the observer in the fast increasing throng of idlers. Those English officers,, of various arms and depariments, whom duty did not call out or 'keep in, flockedin hudreds to -itness the first review of as large a number of British troops that has- been held probably for 40 year3. I should.- think very few were absent whom duty or illness did not detain in camp, and one officer,, the Hon. Percy Eielding, still' suffering from a severe accident that o ed to him some weeks ago, had himself driven to the ground in a cart. There were a great many-artil. lery officers, a very few of cavalry, a multitude of comnmissariat and medical. officers,: army works corps, -&c., some in full dress, some in undress, many in nondescript attire. The foreigners also mustered in great strength.' 'There was ev variety of reach and Sardinian military costume, and even, the . Spanish- unifori was tlere to augment -the 'motley oft-he gathering, 'four officers of that nation being attached to' the -French head-quarters.' Marshal Pel_Lssier camie on the ground.in his carriage and four, by which is not to be understood handsome vehicle and showy team, with well-kept harness and neat postillions-.' bat a veryrough, nearly paintless, Crimean-looking drag, with harness partly of rope, horses that match the carriage as regards roughness, and soldiers,- in artillery saddles, on the near wheeler and leader. The Msrshal is somewhat obese, and not much of an eqiestrianu and he rarely crosses a horse. His little escort of Chasseurs contrasted iithf the English Hussars who followed Sir William Codington an-d kept the ground, and many of whom, as regards both men, and horses, needed only.soine slight changes in uniform and equipment to become extremely heavy cavalry. Mrshal Pelissier alighted -from his carriage, and took his station at the foot ofa-hillock, opposite theicentre of'the line, of the whole of which he then comranded a-good view. The array of the troops was nearly.completed .when a shell, sent in their direction, was seen to burst lhgh in the air above the Valleyof the Tchernaya. Our Russian friends politely informed us that they -were present and attentive; reckoning that we shoiild see' their messenger though they could riot expect him fo reach us. ' The line was. formed of continuous columns of companies, that is to say, it was eight cogpanies or 16 rank andfile deep, with- itervl s-of' six: paces between each regiient. Its :$ was towards the Russian pos,itions beyonkthe vaey. o <the right were the Guards and thotheri& regimeuts fmitngt,heirst Division; then came the ligh4lauders; then the Second, Third, and Fourth,and finally the iLight Division.

They were ' thc. admiration of the foreigners -present,' and well they might be, for assuredly no'finer troops eVer fixed bayonet. The battalions of Rifles were also :nuch praised by the foreign officers, their fashion of carzying their arm- traHiled instead- of shouldered giving a graceful ease and suppleness to their march. &May wete the tattered and shot-rentbaimers yesterday; borne by. .

Aft6r this thie divisions marched straight ,avy to their vairioa camp3, and the country on all sides3 was seea thicly- sprinkled with horsemen can. .tering homewards, bent-in most cases, I suspect, ontakingto themselves something of awarmningnature, for the - cold had really been sharp, and no speculative . canteenman had' thought of sending emises - with well-lined baskets to the scene of the. ieview. When all was over (and also after the mnarch past in open column) -AUrshal Pellissier went up to General Codrinton, and, as I -am informed, complimnented him in. the'highest termis on the appearance of his ' troop's. - It is impossible - but that he was greatly struck )y it.. The numbers on parade would have been*&cnsiderably larger had the whole,of our effective.infantry turned out, but General Wairen's brigade, stationed at-Balaklava- was not ordered up, neither were-the 72dEfighladers and the two'battIons of the 1st'Royals, -which are :encamped some way beyond Kamara; and then. there was the garrison- of1 Sebastopol, and the. Redan, picket, and . camp - guards, Ac,; so that, -: altogethe,r there were many battahlions'and parts of-battalions absent. It Was purely an infantry 'reviw-no artlery. was there, nor any cavalry save the handful of Russars employed in escorting the General and keeping the ground. -The whole a;ffar went off in a most satisfactory- and soldierlikeway. I did not, remark, nor have I heard of a single blunder, andGeneralCodringtonhad every remn to be proud of the army he has the honour to comnmand.- I iiave just been informed that an officer vFas shot this -morning by Russia riflemen in the valley 'of Inkeimann. I have not heard eithei his. name or his regimient, and the intelligence may possibly be unfounded, but it is also likely enough to betrae. Officers not unfrequently ride. and shoot in.the vicinity of the French advanced posts, and I have been told of instances of their borrowing a rifle from a French . soldier to have - what is here called l.a " pot " at the Ruskies. This last practice, which I trust is not frequent, is. surely much to be condeimned.; - Ontheother haid, it must be admittedthat - the wanton fire kept up.by,the Rusians, from,e -to time, on every point- of our lines, which is, or which they believe to be, atainable by their shell -and cannon ball, entitles themn to no consideration or forbearance on our part. . They are naturally es. * asperated at seeing us destroying, at our leisdire and with comparatively little trouble, the doc, barracls,- buildings; and fortifications, which cost then such enormons labour and so vast an zmoun- of gold.

This latter had senseenoiighto confide the directionof tihis property to an: inteligent European, - piomising i l10 per cent. of the net revenue, and since the last two years he gets an income of 700,000 piatres from it.. The consequenco of thisadilicaltytD invest money with anything likeadvantage is that nearly- every 'Turk who dies leaves at lea t half his property' in ready money behind hum, which had been for years previously withdrawn from circulation. The establishment of a bank of Cre'dit Mobilier on. a broad basis would by degrees bring all this dead-capital into play, and'would at the satae time have a large- influence on the state of the higher classes in Turkey. In the absernce of every other employment which would reward themn for4heir labour, all men in'Turkey, especially the offspring of the oicial- class, are bmni place-hunters. In that senseless centralization, which Jealously denies to the provinces every. free movement, any one who 'wants to advance inL life ratural1y tends towards Stamboul, where he gets soon drawn into all the intrigues of which Turkish official life is composed, and loses his honesty.. The opning of a new career in the agricultural and counmemcial development of the country would counteraet (this evil most powerflilly, by establiing an indepe dent class of menj -which is entirely manting. in Trkey.

And-the elements of such anindependent class,which oughttofortanesse*tiaI constitt entpt ' of every State, are not wanting in Turkey. They must, of course, not be sought in Constanitinople, where everybody is dra-wn more 'or less!intothe whirl of the central Government, but in the provinces, where 'this ceutralization has not thdroughly penetrated, among the l arg.e lancded.iro4rietors. IUnder the - former -re, -when the provinlces e- joyed a certain amount]of independence,.and were less subject to the political chafiges! of ', capital,many men confined their ambition to their native districts, and by .ttwhing themsevesio fhefo tunes of one or another of the influ9ntial governors, acquired latge -landed property.

The--whole quantity exracted- dining t;he period of L4 moniths wlichhad elapsed, was 42,812 5.20 tons, of- which23,33& 5.2-'*ere shipped for the use of the Engish nay, $274 4'ons given to the Fr&,ch, and. The- costs ---including the expenses -which the shipping of these remaining 15,000 tons. will cause, - amount fo S2,981.,-so 'that the a-rerage eost per ton -is-ls., exclsive -of -'the royalty of 10 per -cent. payable to the Tu rkish-Gover nen, and 10'per cent. which Mesr. Barldey think should be allowed for the inferior evaporating powers of this coal, in order to establish an equitable comparison between its cost and that of the coaIl obtifaed from EnglanX. With these additions the' ton of coal on board sh;p at Kosloo eosts 21. 7s. Gd&, while the cost of English coal in -port at Constantinople was for the Last year 55s.-per ton. - For the next 12 months it- is hoped that 42;8W0 tons. wll be extracted, -which, with the 15,000 not yet shipped, makes 57,800 tons. But, ihis is the quantity-which may be extracted; the quantity which can r6allybe shipped depends on the number of mules and-bullockl carts which can be -employed -for its conveyance to the- shipping straits at Zungelduk, anid thence to Eur tdepots at Xosloo. For the- -57,800 tons 300 mules, and l0( bullocksarts would be required, and they can easily be procured in the neighbourhood. 20 lighters, able to carry in fine weather froni 400 to 500 tons a daF on. board, woiud be sufficient for their conveyance tg> the vessels. - . - There has been anew layer of coal, of s superior .quality, found in the neighbourhood of osloo, at Oozelmaz.

The railway meetings of the week have comprised Eeveral leadinig undertadings, the- dividends proposed having in all cases been agreed to. The reportof the WestLondonCoinpany has beenadopted. It is stated that the long-pending dispute with: the London and North-Western Railway has not yet been setled, but that. it is expected an award wil be made before the next half-yearly general meeting. According to the accounts of the lancaster and Carlisle Railway, the disposable' balance will admit of a' dividend at- the rate of 7 per cent. per annum." The directors of the East Anglian complain that their-exertions to obtain the rights guaranteed under the aragement with the Eastern Counties Company have not proved successful, but they express a hope that equal mileage rates will eventually be carried out. The dividend of the Glasgow and South-Western Railway is at the rate of 4per cent., and the report has been agreed to. The inerease of traffic is encouraging, and the branches, when' completed, promise to assist in its general development. By the report of the North British Company it appears that the net revenue will, after paying the balance of the former preference dividend, discharge the one now due, and leave nearly 1,0001. to be carried forward. The progress of the Cork and Youghal Railway is detailed in the report just adopted, and, as the line passes through a rich agricultural district, it is exeted that it will yield a satisfactory return for the invested capitaL. The dividend of the Lancashire andYorkshire Company has been confirmed at the rate of 2i per cent. on the 1001. stock for the half-year, and the report has been adopted. The directors of the Midland Great Western recommend a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum,' free of income-tax. The report of the Dearness Valley Company has been agreed to, and the directors, owing to the position of the money-market, have abstained from calling up any portion of the capitaL. The Great Western and Brentfo'rd line is malEing satisfactory progress, and the works'will, it is stated, b completed within the Parliamentary estimate. The report of the Norfolk Company has been adopted, and a dividend of 25s. per cent. for the half-year declared. The works on some parts of the Cornwall line are being carried out vigorously, and every endeavour will be made to complete it with all possible despatch. According to the reportof the Newry and Enniskillen Company, the directors are exercisino- strict economy. They state that an offer has been'made to sell or lease the railwayto the Dublin and Belfast Company on reasonable terms, but no satisfactory reply has been obtained. It has been agreed at a general meeting of the St. Rambert and Grenoble Railway to construct two branch lines to unite Grenoble to Lyons and Valence. An arrangement hasbeen made with the Cr6dit Aobilier for raising the principal proportion of the capital. At the Darlington and Barnard Castle meeting the report was received as satisfactory, andthe line is makng ste'ady progress towards completion. A working ag,reementwith the Stock-ton and Darlington Company for' ten years, subject to a revision after twro years' experience, has been sanctioned. The dividend -recommended in the fmancial statement of the Maryport and Carlisle Railway is at the rate of 20s. per share on the 501. shares, and in proportion on the other description of securities. The directors of the Limerick and Castleconnel Railway intimate that they have been steadily pushing forward the measures for. carying out that undertaking. As the works are about being commenced, punctuality in the payment of calls is required. At the Waterford: a;nd Limijerick meeigi a agred 4 aoptthereprt,discharge the preference dividend, and carry over the balance to the credit of the next account. The dividend of the Leeds, Bradford, and Eaifaax Junction Company is at the rate of 6 per cent., the revenue exhibiting a satisfactory increase. The shareholders of the North Yorkshire and Cleveland Railway have agreed to the report, and the line to Stokesley, it is hoped, may be completed during the present year. The dividend of the Frness Railway will be at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum, and the results of traffic are stated to be more favourable than was anticipated. It was stated at the meeting of the Edinburgh, Perth, and Dundee Company that the general prospects have improved, the agreement with the ScottiCh Central having already been productive of benefit; a dividend of 2s. 8d. per share on the ordinary stock was carried, and a belief is expressed that the revenue -vill now be steadily developed. The dividend of the Sunderland Dock Company is at the rate of 4 per cent., and there has latterly been a gradual extension of the trade. The works of the Plymouth Great Western Docks are proceeding, but they have been considerably retarded from want of the necessary capital. The dividend recommended by the Caledonian and Dumbartonshire Railway is at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum.. The report of the Edinburgh and (Glasgow Company has been adopted, together with a dividend at the rate of 2 per cent. An amicable arrangement havimg been effected w%ith tho Caledonian Company, it is trusted that it may not again be interrupted. The Laniater and tlverstone line will be finished with all possible expedition, but the prevailing tightness in the money-market has' checked the usual progress of the works. The dividend of the Eomerset Central Railway is at. the rate of 4 per cent., the principal revenue being the rent derived from the Bristol and Exeter Company. The report of the Blyth and Tyne Railwav has been confinmed, and a dividend equal to 9 per cent. on the paid up capital has been agreed to. 'The works of the Ilanidloesand Newtown Company are progress-- ing, and the railway will be completed within the engineer's estimate. The Railway Passengers A-surance Company have declared a dividend at the rate of 4 per cent., and the report exhibits in its general details encouragin results. The specie arrivals of the week have amounted to 00,0001., of which less than 200,000. has been retained. The shipments have included 470,5981. to India and China, and 50,0001. to the']West Indies, in addition to the gold sent to the Bank of France. The prospectus 1has been issued of the London Steam Towing Company, awith a capital of 32,0001., in 251. shares. The object is to. increase the supply of' steam towing boats between London and the Channel, and'it is proposed to place on the station as' speedily as possible three' boats, respectively of 100, 80, and 60 hbrse power.

Itc is satited that tlie.nlame of: Mr. hwart, M.P., should have been included in the copy of the resolution printed yesterday appointing a committee of shareholders to confer with the Board of the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada. The following, on the colonial produce-markets during the pasc month, is from the circular of Messrs. W. J. and H. Thompson:- " The unsettled aspect of political affairs pending the result of - the Congress nowr being held at PariE, and the stringency of the mnony-market, coupledt with a few failures cOnSeqUent on the late sudden revolution in prices, hsve affected several branches of trade. Disturbed m some de. gree by the foregoingcircumstance,thecolonialmarketshave generally been very depressed, and most articles of produce show a decline. Sugar, however, has formed a exceptiona slight inquiry arose in the early parb of the month, mainly forexport, at a fall of ls. to 2s. per cwt., but this was only temporary i and, though very large quantities were brought to sale, all were taken by exporters, speculators, andrefiners, and prices rose 2s. Gd. to vs. per cwt. from the lowest point. Muchattentionisnow attractedtothe prospectsof this artile for the next l2months. The stocks undoubtedly show a considerable increase, but the trade throughoub the kingdom are very scantily supplied; and it must be borne in mind that, while the West India sugars have commenced to arrive some weeks before the usual time, the long frost and adverse winds of last year then prevented a further arrival of the nXew crop, and a consequent accumvlation of stock From the British West Inesea large supply is anticipated, but the accoumts froin Havannah are by' no means favourable; the continuous rain has injured the cane very materially on many esates7 and also prevents the supplies beingforwarded. Yet, even hoald the crop prove larger than anticipated, the very small quantity of land taken for sugar growing in Louisiana wiU cause much heavier shipments to America, and overbalance any surplus. From the Mauritius a short supply is expectea, and also from the Brazils; while the accoants from Java speak of the almost total destruction of the crop by long drought. tum is iat at a fall of 2d. per galon. Coffee 'has also been dull. There hasbeen verygreat depres~sioninI the rice-market, owng to the serious f in cor, the enormons increase of stocks, and large ariivals, and rates have given way about Is. 6d. to 2s. per cwt. Saltpetre has ruled zlatly,at 2s. per cwt. decline, but latterly the middling linds are in more demand, and Is. per cwt. enhancement. has been paid forthis quality. The chief feature in spice is a fall of Ss. per cwt. in cassie lignea. The indigo quarterly sales comprised 9,000 chests; a good demand prevailed both for home and export uses.

"The 16th clause of such petition states that certain individuals therein referred to, including Mz. John Thoma, ' resolved to attemapt, with the assistance of Governiment, to execute the improvements;' and the 17th clause that those individuals provided the security required by the act. N[ow, both these statements are erroneous. The improvements were to be exec'utedl by the conmmissioners, andthey alone were to provide the security.

Mr. Xfon oaso (one of the candidates) then said, he hak three resolutions to propose to the meeting. The first was,-- " That the poll taken on the occasion of the reoent election of direCtors be printed and sold to such persons as may require it at the price of ls. per copy, with fUll and. accurate addressesnotonlyof thosewhovoted,butalsoofthe shareholders generally." The second resolution was,-"That, inasmuch as any proprietor requiring a list of the shareholders of this company is subjected to a charge of' 101. 10s. for a copy thereof, this meeting do order- and. direct that a list of the ordinary stock or share holders. of the company be printed every year, as early as possible after the closing of thc books for transfers, and that the same be sold at the price of 5e. per Copy."

ST-ATE OF TRADE; MAN-CHESTER, KLuncs 8. The market continues firm, with a modeiate demand, but still the business done in cloths 'is not sufficiently large in cormparison with the production to enable manufactirers to command adequate prices. " It would be difficult to refer to a period (say Messrs. John Munn and Co., in-their circuI lar ef yesterday) when so narrow amargin remained betwkeen Je worth of a pound of cotton and that of a pound of cloth, 'especially in.he lower qualities of coarse fabrics." The demand for domestics has improved a little this week for the home'trade, and the business is sufficient to displace stocks 'but insufflcient to enable producers to dictate satisfactory terms. The advance in price is notequaltothe rise in the cotton and yarns of which they are made. The sellers of 40-inch sixrtings have doneamoderatebusiness this week for Calcutta and China, at an advance in some cases of lJd. per piece; but there is a better deniand for 35 inches from thehome trade, and prices are bettersupported. Rather more animation .has been displayed alsd among the buyers of printing cloths. The last advices from Constantinople and Alexandria have discouraged operations for the Levant. For yarns there continues a healthy demand, and rices are about 1d. per -lb. higher than last week for most descriitinen. F;rom S?0f5 to 30's water twist in bun'dle and warp, fcr export, and double yarns, from 40's upwards, are in fair demand, the business for Yorkshire and ,or the con- tinent. beingz moderately active, in addition to afair basiness, for manufacturers. India numbers have had more inquiry. BIR 'GHA3M, 3LtCi S. The iron trade continues less active than 'it was in the early part of January, and until the result. of the Paris Conferences is made known there is nut much probability of its revival. - The spring orders are coming in slowly, but it is known that American merchants more especiall are holding tack until the question of war and peace is fully settled. The principal houses of the district, notwithstahding a fail in the prfce of pigs, maintain vith apparent firmness January quotations, and it is not expected that any variation vill be declared atthe preliminary meeting of the trade, which will be held in the course oE the present month. Should a general peace be established, and tile market again opened with Northern Europe, our ironmasters anticipate a flourishing suiumer trade. The coalmasters of the district have at length reduced pices ls. per ton, but still they are enormously high;aidwhatisinore'remiarkable-thie best descriptions are advertised TO be sold in.London- at prices Ettle more than t-hose given by consumers inllirmiaghani.*° In addition to the large contracts for ironfoundry mentioned last week, the' East India Company have issuedsecifications for the supply of various descriptions of iron and ha7rdware goods.o The Government orders for military stores are also continuous, and during the' week those given out for cavalry forges have been mured f6rWard with more than nsual earnestness. Some of -the contracts for shot and shell have been completed, and apparently there is a lull in' this branch of manufactre, bhut for saddlers' wvork required for the army there is still a considerable demand. The home demand for general ironmongery is represented to be somewhat brisker, and commercial meii speak of trade throughout the country as better than it was at the 'corre- sponding period of last year.. Those of ourfactors -who are' usuallythe firs to complainwhendunlness occurs admit that trade is more lively than under the present circumstanews of the country niight have boon expected, and peace only required to insure further improvement. Theedged-tool business is good, and'the orders recently received from the AustraLisa colonies for this description of manufacture indicate an exhaustion -of 'stocks in those colonies. There. are' at the present time'buyers from 3elbourne in Birmingham,'and from their reprtzentaticns it isto be inferred that a steady trade m=y: be' expected. Those of our aztisans who left Birmingham a few years ago with the intent of eursuing the manufacturo of hardware articles in AustraliaEd they are unabletocompete with the homemarnufacturers either with regard to price or quality. The demand for steel toys is also slightly on the increase for the Australian .markets; large shipments will be made by the next packets sailing for M1elbourne. There has been a good deal doing latterly in telegraph wires, and for wise &enerally, iron as well as copper, the demand is good. The tinplate workers of Binnirgham and Wolverhainpton are very acive, and some of the establishments "walking over-'insei but wee egretito state that one or two of our largest brassfounders in this town are more than usually slack. The present high price of metal prevents the founders, when short of orders, worldng for stock, and' many men are conseque&itly only partially employed.. The jewelry business, notwithstanding- the extensive los.ses re- - ,ently experienced by several of tlce 'latge houses, continues brisk, and it is stated that the watch trade at Coventry is recovering from its late depression. In comumon with many branches of Birmingham manufactures, tho watch business has suffered greatly by over-trading to 'Australia but the last advices represent that for good and useful articles there is an improving demand. The hollow wrze maunflecture at Westbromwich is not over brisk, although there is a fair demand in the home market. 'he railway carriage waggon mnakers of the neighbourhood are apparently pretty fully employed. The great inrWease wVich is continuoUsly taling Dlace in the- goods traffic on the various lines of the king om,but more especially in the Northern and Midland counties, has caused a great increase in the number and extent of these establishTnents in this immediate vicinity. For some time it was found impossible to supply mineral trucks fast enough for reveral ot the companies, and even now these descriptions of vehicles are in considerable request and -keep all the works in pretty good employment. The Egyptian Ilailway has already required a largo supply of cariages, 'and promises further orders for both passenger and goods carriages. The cut nail trade, if not so busy as it was some 1ime ago, is, under all circumstances, somewhat active. The great dearth in the building trade- which is observable throughout the country operates against the mail and hinge trades more eeciahiyl but although, at least in Birmingham and the neighbourhood, building' operatiois -have been almost entirely suspended, thefalling off of hardwvare articles required in building has not been so great as might have been expected. The wocod screw business, as a matter of course, sympathizes with the state of the nail manufacture, and suffers froth the same causes. *ThesnDitary gunmakers are busily employed with their - contracts, and are said to be now producing, notvithstandig thestrictness of tho view, not less than -3,000 muskets per week. We hear nothing now of differences between the masters and the men, while the former appear to work in perfect harmony 'with the Board of Ordnance. At this season of' the year the birding' gun trade is never over, brisk, and the difficulty now thrown in the way of exports' to the continent has rendered it still duller than it usually is. The Tower work; however, affords abundant work for good hands, aud so long as this can be obtained at fair prices the gunfitters are comnparatively'careIess about the state of the birding branch. The inconvenience caused at one time by the scarcity of first-class workmen, numbers of whom leftthis country, and were engaged in the gettingup of tBelgiancorttracts, Seems to have been completely remnedied, and the work turTned out in :a, style and at aspeed which cannot but hbs'satisfactory to'the most fastidiois "of Ordnance officials.,- The :sword' cutlery business is scarcely so 7Lctive as a few weeks ago,' but Etill betterthan previous to the cormencementof th nwar. A 'new joint-stock, bank is about to bo establishedin Birmiaghamr; and, 'we ire now told, underRauspices that augur wellforits success. The capitalwill be 200,0001. in' 1001. shares, the directrs being emnowered' to raise the amonut to 500,0001., and to establish agencies in all 'the large towns of the kingdom, as well as on the continAut of E urope; Such is the project as annonnced in a prospeotus' now sn course of eircuotlto, and to ivhich highly respetable names are affixed.

' . , : - The-warehouses have been visited by a good number of buyers this week, including some from Irend as weL as London and a few of the large towns in thei provinces. They. purchased to a good average extent of seas6nable goods. Some of the eXporb houses are tolerably busy, and that, too, in the execution of orders, zather than oi specu lativo.acpqunt.. The wools -purcfiaed at -the late sales in london (which closed yesierday) are -omini to hand, and there isevery re-,son to believe they will soon be in the process of transformahion into cloth3.- As to'the sales, we quote the foUow. iag from the circular of an eminent London broker:- " The sales commenced_on the 14th of February. The quantities sold have beea 43,041 bales colonial, 3,165 bales last India,- 504 bales China, 3,136 bales foreign ; total, 49,846 bales. With prospects of peace and other favourable combination of circumstances, notwithstanding the continnled-high alue of mone;, the attendanca of buyers from allparts h3s been' unprccedentedly large,' th6se fror the north of England being most numerous-and the sales oFened with great spirit, at an advance of 10 tol2V per cent. on tho average rates of the October and Novenbers3ales, and have continued to the close with an upvward tendency, obsen-able at each night's sale,nud7er the influence of extensiveforeign purchases, until-the advance on nearly all lkinds reachedL 15 to 207 per cent. upon'the average-of the pr6vious series. The total tat-en for exportw ve cannot estimate at less than 15,000 bales. We may confidently state tbat for many years the-waraehouses have not been so cleared of al descriptions of wool, or the market wor so healthy an aspect as at the P resent time." t The report from l3radford this wreek showis that there is X good seasonable demand for piece goad5s, and that prices of both the rav. andthbe sanufactured articles are becoming more equalized than they -were a fortnight ago. In sj ste of the complaints made by the spinners of yarns and the manufacturers of piceeo goods, they bave aquite the power to advance their prices in proportion to the rise in the price of wool. * The Halifax market to-day has been animated, and better prices for most articles have been obtained. Those of wool are quite firm. '[be linen and the coal trades at Barnslev aro in very differentconditions; the former is brisk, the-latterdulL A report, of yesterday's date, from Barnsley,is asfollows - " During the-past mouth trade has been brisker than for a considerable tinie previously, both in the manufacture of fancy drills and of-nearlyall other fabrics for the home and foreign markets. - In fancy drills, however-both damask driLls and thoso wvoven by treadles-thereis at present a considerable faling off, but common gooas for home c:nusiunption are stiU in good demand, and weavers ara fully employed. There is a moderate demnand-'for broad' shectings and broad- and narrowf diapers. The po derloonns at the respective mills are in full work. In many cases coarso three-leaf and .five-leaf drills are"'being substituted for the better kinds of fabrics, which have been made duri.ng the winter,; bat 'on these the weavers can make comparatively small wages. There seenis to be at present a great caD for fabrics woven by power, and it is said that nearly all the firms ar.e augmentg the inuuher of-their looms. The depression of the coal trade stil continues, And many of the miners are not working halftime. There has not-been such a dearth in the coals trade! for four or five years-as noxv exists in this part of Yorkshire, and parties f irther north have to deplore a similar state of tning3. DUBLINj Mseca S. This wek lhas been rather a dull one in trade,and, though the considerable decline, combined with the, continued fatness of the corn-markets, is calculated to impart some briskness to those of produce, business remains without animation, 'enterprise is completely clogged by the still very doubtful character 6f the peace movement, and opeartions appear'limited to the bare necessities of the moment. This samieness, this almost total absence of all speculative transactionsi while preventing 'vigorous commercial action, is favourable to the soundness and safety of trade; and we have i, accordingly, in a healthy enough condition, though not in the vigoar and epon the scale which would prove gratifying to the commercial community. The Customs' receipts forthe week,-to Thursday inclusive, were lG,4901., against 18,Ql01. last -week. The following is an abstract of duties received at the port of Dublin for the week euded the 1st of liarch:- Smithfield-market on' Thursday was thinly supplied, which circumstance, coupled with a brisk demand, occa; sioned a firmnesa in prices. 2rovisions were a-lso scarcer and dearer than last week.. The operations oi the StocLk Exchange were not remarkable on any account this week.

LONDOzN, MONDAY, MARCH 10, 18:6. .j .. . .....0 The tale of Kars is soon told. The papers now puwished cannot be said to ada much to what was known or might have been divined before. The history of the British officers seems merely one long struggle against'an inevitable destiny. The year 1855 commenced gloomily for them. In the depth of winter,' amid the snows of a mountainous region, General Wm TAr continues hM4 recommendations and reforms at Erzeroum. 1Here he receives from Lord CLAxNo2f the despatch in which the Ambassador had defended his conduct. General W TLLi:ms hastens to justify himself. "I was," he says, " within eleven "hours' march of an intelligent aid disci"plined enemy, he being flushed by victory, and the Turks dispirited by defeat, dejected by | "starvation and the infamous conduct. of their "I Mushir and officers." Lord STRrTEORD had I urged as an excuse for silence that he kneI "that " during the winter season little comparatively "could be done," General WuJIAms points out that "the weather, instead of not adnitting of " military movements, was open to such operations " for many weeks after my arrival at Kars." Speaking after -four months' experience, 'he declares that ".such unaccountable silence was " higly dangerous to the public cause." ' What," he exclaims, "C could I not have done "in the shape of reform had even a note and "an order from the SausnIn reached me, by the "return of the frst Turldsh poet, which was then "as regular in its arrival as that between London "and Constantinople I" " With regard to AL ;PisANIBs answers on the success of his efforts, "my reports show that the army of Kars remains "without a single reform but that which has "been worked by a Commissioner unacknow. "ledged, though feared, by the base mail who "commanded it." Thus General W s concludes his controversy with the Ambassador, nor does he ever seek to recommence it. It is for the nation now to judge between them. General WILLi&qs after this time devotes his attention to two points,-the provisioning of Xars and the removal of incompetent and delinquent officers. On February 10 he is able to announce to Lord CmRP=Dox, "C We have now in itore at "Kars bread for 50 days, barley for 90 days, rice "for 10 days; so that I have breathing-time to "look round for contractors, and hope to avoid "disgrace in the spring." The supply of provisions is of the most irregular kind, and both the commissariat and clothing departments furnished nefarious' gains to the drunken and debauched chiefs of the army. General WnnrAiis ,endeavoured, though with very incomplete success, to obtain the authority necessary for a reform. Spring advances, the Russians are on the alert, and the outposts of their numerous army are now appearing in the neighbourhood of Kars. The'Commissioner is -almost hopeless, and thus unfolds his griefs to Lord CLAl ND0ox. The date is April 24:"I Neither the land carriage for the army of Kars Cc nor the provisions for that force are to be had "in sufficient quantities; ancd I have .this day "received intelligence from Colonel LAIx drawing "C'my attention tothese points, and, indeed, echoing "the prayers which I have in vain, addressed ": throughout the winter at Constantinopfe." Tho cavalry 'were without boots, horse appointments, or efficient sabre4; the infantry without knapsacks; all were supplied with ammunition " far short of the "6xidencies of a campaign." "mStrely, exclaimns the Commssioner, "this army has been doomnedto "destriiction at the Seraskierate 1" Stil he perseveres, and implores that the Governors of Piarbekir, Kharpoot, and other provinces should be-ordered to forward corn to Erzeroum. Scurvy hac>appeared in Kars, and the Commissioner caused to 'be despatched without delay vegetables, -vinegar, and 'wine. Thus was the health of the army strengthened for the terrible struggle which was shortly to begin.- ' - The General had just finished the fortification of Erzeroum. He had explained the -necessity of the works to the- Council, and induced both the Armenian Bishop. and his Muailman eolleagues to -offer. their assistance. In the mean-time Colonel LAIx was at- work on the forts -of Ears. On the 1st of Afay,-a month'befoie the siege of Kars, coDmences,--General W TiLAxs writes to the Ambassador :-" Several 1 weekfs "ago I addressed your Isrdsbip- on ths neces "sity' of my having authority direct froi Con. -" stantinoplc - to take an active part and "have a deciive voice in the purchase of -"provisions for the army; and, although Lord " P E hass expresed his decided sentiments on " this vital pointj I-have notreceiveda line in allu"s'^ion to it from yoar -ocellanoy; and I have to " state -tat this_army-cannot be supplied with pro:"-visuions without I-cn conitol.hosee:iho have6 this C "matter 'in theii handi."- '; 'sarchthebluebool4 and are oblige& to beEieve that-this aesjatch meets the fate of its predecessora. There is no answer from Lord STR&TFORD DX REDQLME Soon after MouRAvEW is in''the field 'General Wu, LIAMS hastens' up to ns, the enemy closes rbund, and the fiv Vmonths of famine, beg'in. As an episod.we may a.before, our readers a rketch of two Pashas with -whom "General WiLLIAMs had tbdeal. It will- be remeoabeeil' that Lord STRAoRD, at his final rupture with tho Commissioner, 3nade a formal oomplamnt' of A behaviour towards his colleagues of the Piitian force. T-ro of thse m- with whn-tlie.Aaubasiador 'thougft>hat -GeneralW itnrs odught to hav&&urtinued .to, " cultivate the ..ost .riendly "rt,ons"' were named Snonr P.As. and thesmn PASH; -General-' W za Irought them 9 trial' for -treating him in: - insulting manner in presence of the Council,- and anser ing his quistinis with contempt. Theni, # tary .Co.uirt o£, Erieroum ' Oirves at the following facts.:-" It was notorious that the Pashas in"question had givenmthemselves up to such habi, .. tu drunkenness: and disipation that,besides ' havying become. a bad example to the S s "' troops, they wFere never by day, :nconsequenee " of their nocturual debiuchery, in a'rt state of.

Such were the' wretches whom Lord STRATFORD, who knows them as well as any m33a, ptetenas to believe it a. criae of GeneralW WiPrs to treat with firmness! . ' ' Why should: we carry any- further; the -degrading history 9 But a few days before General Wr.rs quitted Ereroumnto take his stand at Kars he write3 to his: earnest and unfailing supporter, Lord C.N.os. The story is the old one. i's first sentence begins, " I "regret to inform your Lordship of the continued "neglect at Constantinople." The cavalyT are now destitute even of slippers, the greater portion of the men riding il stockings. The infantry are in the same plight. On the 7th of June GZeral WaLI.AMS enters Kas The siege has: begn'. Food is wanting, of ammunition there is -hardly any, of men there are few; all that can be done is to endure with firmness, and how that garrison endured is now part of the world's history. As soon as Kars was invested, then the services of General WILLIMs, the importance of the place he held, the value of his advice and remonstrances, were apparent to all. Europe, and more especially Fngland, became interested. The British officers shut up in Kars required the utmost efforts of their coiuItry to save them. Then commenced the hurry and confusion of Last autumn.- Who did their duty, who was most active in that Babel of military advisers, we shall not discuss, since we believe that already the cause was lost. The differences between OX&RJ PASHA and his colleagues in the' Crimea, between Lord CLR.NDON and Count WAtwSK, between L-ord S""svoan and the- SaxASxrs, are of little moment. A few weeks before Goneral Wm;rArS was writing in vain for the power of buying provisions and ordering, boots. Now, when London is beginning to talk about Kars, the most magnificent military plans emanate from Therapia. An army of 40,000 men will at once march to the rescue. It is to be composedOf YIvxAs's Contingent, BATSasoN's Bashi-Bazouks, garrisons from Batoum and Bulgaria, Albanians[E,gypneti guar Cavalry, and TunisHorse. We next have a-somewhat incomprehensible plan for landing 25,000 Kurds on the coast. In August it is debated whither the army shall go. Some are for a direct march to Kars-others for a diversion' in Russian territory. The latter plan, as we know, was thought preferable, and the campaign of O.RN PAss. took' place. The valour, and still more heroic endurance of the garrison, need no recapitulation here. Kas fell, and the fall will not soon be forgotten. We have now described the transactions which have been for so long the subject of somewhat cautious comment. It is some time, we believe, since the public has listened to any history more startling than the one which now stands revealed. We have but done our duty by presenting, it in all its scandalous details. In the cause of justice, of national good faith, and of the public good, every right-thinking man must feel that inquiry and explanation are necessary. General WILLia?S, shattered in health, is a prisoner in'a distantladhis companions in suffering are also far away. In justice to these men, to the nation, and-its allies, we have a right to demand that Parliament will require a strict account from those by whom such a General, such officers, and such an army' ereI left to maintain a hopeless struggle, and the enemy .Was permitted to gain the single success which has attended his arms.
JOHN SADLEIIa was a national calamity. It is not often that an individual rises to a position of ssuch infamous notoriety, but the truth is, now that the whole story of his frauds is beginning to assume -shape and form, that the prosperity of a whole province has received a severe shook from his proceedings. lehasforgeditle-deedsof estates, hehas forged private acceptances and securities, and by his connexion with the Tipperary Bank he has contrived to swindle the population of the south of Ireland to an amount which is already stated at 400,000., and which will probably reach the full proportion of the half-million. Against this result is to be set a sumr of some 35,0007., .and, of course, whatever may be recovered by the .process of selling up innocent shareholders. this is, after all, but to, shift the burden from. the shoulders of the many to the shoulders of the few; and, -even if it can be. done with a reasonable degree of success, it is scarcely to be expected.th:;t the creditors will regain anything morie than a small percentage of their loss. On Ttesday of last week the case was brought before the HaSTR of the R&W in Dublin, on a motion that the copartnership should be dissolved, and the: affairs be wound up in conformity with the provisions of. the Winding-up Act. On this occasion, in delivern his judgment, the MAsrru of the tomLs stated the actual position of affairs to bcias follows .-"'T-he "late JOY SADxEM was permitted. by his "brother, the sole director and manager: of the "bank, to overdraw his account to the extent "of 200,0001;, without the knowledge, consent, or "privity of a single other contributory, or. cre"ditor, so far as this Court has heard 6r knows. "The, liabilities of the Bank are altogetber, in "roundnrumbers, 400,000D.; itwas in a state of the "m nOst hopeless insolvency on the 1st of February "last, and the assets are not pretended to liemxuore, "inround numbers, than 35,0001." T 'his.bing so, in the beginning of February a circular wals issued with the object of persuading thecc- deiudda, "defrauded, and unfortunate contributors," -not only that the Tipperary Joint-stock Bankl was in- a thorouglay solvent and satisfactory state,.but that it was actually in a condition to pay a bonus of 3. per .cent. on a paid-up eapital of- 100 000., and thiat after the payrnent of tnc bonus a surplus would remainm The story appears to be'e,ven more pitiable than r*i8'isati rst!spposed, now that -the ocia'. postiox?of' th6, majorit of the sufferers as beeh more cey acertined. We ;:hear of small farmer, traders, clerks, assistants, police-oficers,'., -'wio have lostI their1it,le acuimalations from thel thrift of many years.

It is a surprising fist that it:should le, in the powerof any man t swindae,is4 fela4subjects -to the amoimt of a million sterling, and yet this suim will -probably; fall- short of the veality when the full extent of -Joxi SA 's frauds has been ascertained. What wuh-the Tipperar,yank:-what -with the forgeries of private a ,he frauds arising fro3n the forgery of' ile-deeds, Ireland alone Wi stanid as sufferer for .the larger. portion of the sum. The railway-and banklcaccounts' in London *111 complete the, tale. ,here is lo instance in -history, ai far zas ourl recollection extends, which can serve as a: parallel'to_ this. gigantic frauld, for -in the caso of, h]& . the Scotch adventurer represented -rather the- RxscsrT and the Govermment of Prance than himielfG Much the same thiing may 1e- said of the heroes of the South Sea Bubble, and the railway mania in our own times. All the world was mad ; and ce3rtain clear-headed sharpers -fimed the madness' n the names of various companies which were kmowu. to be made of such stuiff as dreams are: made of. Our forefathers, and the present generation, too, upon these occasions, all went mad together; and the inevitable consequences followed whenL the crashtime came. ThecaseC, howOver, of JoM F SADLMand, 'rom what we now see, we fear it must be said of JAMs SADM also-rests upon a. -very different foundatiomn We are not all rushing down to Brokers'-alley or (lapel-court; we are not looking for 60 per cent.' and unqynesti6nablet securty. We are, on the contrary', busy -with' a ttoxblesome and expensive war. We aze scraping t6gether pence, rather than risking pounds for the salke of inordinate gain. The present period, for the majority of Englishmen, is one of economy, not of speculation. In the :nidst of al our caution, however, of all our thrift, of all our circumspection, a knave slips unawares into the-camp and asindles his fellow-subjects out of the enormous sum of 1,000,0001 sterling. TM, history of JomsU SAMinrn-hit Us rather ' say of JOUN and JAmS SAi)DLE-is curious enough when contrasted with their performances. They are not in the positi'on of gamblers who havethrown a heavy stake zupon the table aid lost it. Their father is at present living, a smnall tenant_ farmer in the south of Ireland. . Fom-- such an origin, respectable enough no, doubt, J6o SAD- IsM started in life, and contrived-to swallow up a million -of money before he put an end to his I existence on HampsteAd-heath. Th6 career of Jomu SADTR after his departure from the farm is ! now notorious enough. Provincial attorney, and then' attorney-in Dublin, political intriguer, Parliamentary agent, membner of Parlianient, 'Lord-of the Treasury, railwaychairman, and bank director -such were the steps of his career, until he con- - cluded it as speculator, swindler, and suicide. - This hideous history may not, we earnestly trust, prove without effect. It is impossible to be mixed up 'with society in London-anu ' the provincial capitals, it appears, are not behind us in this respect-without becoming painfully aware of the range of illegitimate speculation. The men who engage in this unfortunate career never seem to consider that they are playing against loaded dice. One succeeds in - the desperate game, and a thousand perish-the success of the one is magnified, and proclaimed with admiration and envy from mouth to mouth; the ruin of the thousand passes without, notice and without comment. The art of converting airy nothings into solid coin is far too much in vogue for public security or pubLic happiness. This is an error beyond the reach of legislation. Under any system of laws which grants to commerce that freedom without which commerce cannot subsist, the unfair speculator will have his opportunities, and will abuse them. On persons 'who are inclined to enter upon such a path remonstrance would be thrown away-we can simply point !to the grave of Joux SADr, and say, " Takie ivari?ng I It may well be that tofesw persons will be granted the opportunity of perpetrating frauds upon so gigantic a scale. Thus, from want of occasion, rathar than of will, they may avoid the full- meaaure of his despair 'and the full horror of his fate. Let them, however, be well assured that, lithout the dismal success of Jonr SAxxr.M, and without the agony of his closing life, the Demon f !. Specnllation has secondary punishments in store: for its victims, sharp enough to deter any but madmen from venturing their good name and happiness in such a career.
That it would be a pity to destroy Hampstead-I heath any one who has ever been there'will at once admit. With the finest parks in thei world, London is still far -too much of a city and 'breathes too little of the country. It is a city, not of palaces, like .Paris, nor of temiiles, like Rome, but of cities like itself alonea number of townships that on the con'tinent would each make a very xespectable capital :going to form the great metropolis. But, though it is every day spreadiug further and. further, we 'are now and . then threatened -with the loss of the few scraps of .field 'and 'garden that are, left to us in this wilderness of brick and mortar. St. James's Park has- jst -been saved from ant encroachment tlhat. wouldvirtutally have destroyed it. HEamptead-heathl is aow, by the spread -of ' buildings. anll around, equally endangered, although :not in the' . s&me manner. The Heath consists of abot 200 acres of- land, and is overlooked by eminencem-iU the adjoining felds wfiich are admirably i.dapted ns sites for houses, which 'contfrators wou4 gladly occupy, and which the possessor woul'a gladly dispose of. But by' the erection of ho6dses on these. eminences the beauty of the Heat wwould be very much destroyed. It is, indeed, not the fault of the present propriet°r: 'that. a Lingle acre remrains be Ifrom briiks and imortar Bythe. wilL of his father,.however, ho has no power to grant building leases. over this; portion of luhis estates, and the property is: availablbf only for agri cultural purposes.- It iis therefore,-in7the meaii.time of less. value tha-n if it were hield without that prohibition:.

It is but fair that'those who will gain most should also pay most; and, if the; really show some public spirit in - endeavouring to obtain this park, we are pretty confident tha1. the House of Commons will . meet them in the same liberal spirit.

So ridiculous is it that it is very difficult to refrain from laughteW in telling it, although at the very crisis of our struggle 'with Russia it was on the vergeof givingheran ally andus an enemy. Whent Mr. Murray, ourformer Consul-General inEgypt, and a ms of abifity, took charge bf the British mission at the Persia; capital, he found there one Mirza Hashim, a discarded offioer of the- Persian Government, wrho had sought itsprotectioft againstbis ownSovereign; foras asanctuarytheBritishL.egation was considered, and, strange tosay, the abuse evenx winked at by the Persian Government. Mr. Mirza ws by birth a Persian, and ought to have had no such asylum; but -worse. he had a wife;- Mfrs. Xashim, and she was not only a Persian, but sister to one of the 100 Queens of the King of Kings. Moreover, the lady was of so expan. sive a philanthropy that she made no distimntion between: the circumcised and -the uncircumcised. Certainly the British envoy ought not to have made £he British mission an asylum for suspiciousPesian subjects, but he: was new to the country and its: mnners, and ignorant of its Ian. guage; andprobably he droppedatonce onhis arrival into tshe hands of some vuilgar clique. Strangely enough, as we have-said, the Majesty of Persia respected the sanctuay oE - thEe Britishanissonasfar~as the husband was concerned, s4 longat least as he conined to eside within it; :bnt notsE asregarded the wife, very sister-in-law of royalty. Her he seized end lodgedin his harem. The Brit Envoy on thig omplained of the violation of the sanctlryo wnith the jealousyo of a Jeviih high priest. He even-;virtualy extended the privilege of sanctuary over ite whole idngdomr of Persia yv creatingh for lira ]szshim, pe-contrary to treaty, a nev post mn the aient, caoital Shitre, ditstnt fromithe modernone and the British rcission by same 450 ailes. This wasl in crealive, to force a consu:l upon the M ujesit of Persia in spit3 of the-refusal .of aa z cr atcur. The lessian l ringr tus* heBed in his- own dewinionah naturally enouth ehreat oid to seize t persoi of ir Hfsbinwhenever he- could iand it, outof the limits of the British mission; inrd thereupon commenced a most unbecoting correspondence,-nd the Persian, . urt,uprto that point al right; contrived, to a ery coonsiderable degree, to put itself in the rongl.

OROBBIGS INKETLIGBNCE. _----- de FRANCE. [Aporlionof -.the w gw peazed.;4 owmoondoditon .f ,b-. _ (7a;OM OUR. 0WN ORD, ) 'PA=I, -F?RDAY, MAH 7,.6 P. The piosiect of a settlement of the virious points under the consideration of the Plenipotentiaries was gloomy- enough -last week, and I suspect that more thaneoneP Inipotentiary began to be seriously apprehensive of the result. Had the members of the Congress beenat libertyto speaktheir thoughts some' sx or seven days ago, I believe it would 5e found that war rather than peace was by them regarded- as more likely to follo*the expiration of the armistice. Matters have now changed, and -changed much for the better. The three sittings of the Congress last week were far from justifying the hopes of' S pacific arrangement. The two sittings of the pre-~ sent week are. more cheeripg, so -far as they have gone. I have already told you that Tuesday`s conferences ended more satisfactorily than the. previous ones,, and I think I can now inform you< that those of yesterday were still more so. Indeed, so sanguine is the hope in certain quarters (as I am informed) that the chances in favour of peace are greatly 'agmented, that- peacoe is =0ookedupon'as-all but certain. There were two modes of arriving at'peaco; one by large ooncessions on the 'pai of the-allies; the other, by large concessions on that of Russia. So-far as can be ascertained in- matters where everything isragainst obtaining accurate information5 no concessions of any moment have been made by us. Tfhe- logical concluiionis that it is Russi that isgraduallyyieldingw while England and Franceare still as united and firm as- ever. Of the Emperor's conduct throughout I hear the best accounts on- every side. Of the favourable change which- has come over the aspect of the conferences I believe no doubt need be entertaineda Thie information comes -TTom an excellent source, and it is coDlirmed in other quarters. As to the particular points on which concessions have been made I cannot say anythig with the certainty requisite when matters of such moment are in question.- It is, however, said by persons entitled to respect that the fifth point has been-decided, satisfactorily of course, and that the Dne before the. Plenipotentiaries relates to the Danubian Principalties. This latter intelligence I I give, of course, with much more reserve than that which refers to the cheering aspect which the conEcrences generaly have assumed. You may not have forgotten what was said about fhe topographicalmistake assertedto have been committed 'with regard to the rectification of the Ottoman territory. It will, -I suppose, be taken for granted that Russia has comprised that rectification ini her concessons. I learn this day that -enile Couint OrlofE and Baron Bruno'w- are engsged in council here, Russian engineers are erecting fortifications on the very line which was proposed as the new frontier. Her works in the Gulf of Finland I alluded to in a previous letter. 'Whether peace be made or not, an English fleet wil be stationed in the Baltic, probably with a view to protect Sweden against the vengeance of her powerfal neighbour. I regret to find that no concessions Russia makes are likely to establish confidence in her sincerity. It is her misfortune that the more she seems disposed to grant the less is the faith reposed in her. Her friends saythat she will not be the last to profit by the dissolution of the Ottoman empire, which the very reforms the allies will insist on realizingwill hasten. Hierpolicy will be to promote by all means in her power that decay, and she accepts peae with the fhope that the AngloFrench alliance will not long survive its conclusion, and with' the frm determination of d lreakl g vengeance on Austria by the exaltation of Prussia in Germany. Russia calculates on the gradual loosening Of the bonds which unite England and rFance, ic she cannot cut wthe knot herself. She behleves that two countries with a formu of governmemt So opposed, and with institutions so diilerent howrever they may unitefor commonsafety in days of difficulty and peril, must be dissevered when the danger has gone -c an at there are a hundred chances, any one of hich' may be advantageosly made use of to sthat end. Were the small extremity of the wer e stobe inserted, Russia wold answer for the speedy introdiction of the -whole. Indeed, Rusleia anticipates no small amount gof confion and quarrelling afterathe peace. sow is it possibie, she asks, for 'the Emperor Napoleon to remain quiet He is an absolute sovereign, and the liberty' he has put donv in France he will not tolerate elsewhere. g e cannot do so if he wobald; andPiedmont, Spain, and perhaps Belgium will soon- have to look to themselves and theirinstitutions. This reasoning is more specious than reaL IfLouis NapoleonBonepartebe an absolute monarch, he is not absolute in the same sense as the Emperor of Russia or the Emperor of 'Austria; and, if he has forced RussianPlenipotentikrica to come to Paris to sue for peace, he has done so by his union with England and Piedmont, eio libeal' countries, and supportedby the ayrmpathy, if not bygthe conting,ents,'f Spain and Portugal. The scattered elements of real lberalsmn in Europe ~have aided, morally 'or materially, in the glorious cause of resistance to barbaros aggression. Itwas stated some time since in one of thea olaco gpapers of MIadrid, and again repeated here, that one~ 'of the first acts of- Lodus iapoleon after peace was concluded would be an intervention in Spain, an intervention aginst Spanish independence and liberty, bymeans3 of open and brute force, like that under the Restoration f or in the sneaking and treacherous system whch was so congenial to renchs statesmen hnder Louris Philippe. It is, I am- conSinced,' as- pfounded as hwas the panic of rngiesh invasion.p Louis im apoleon has proved to the world that no man understands 'his own in-terests better than he does, and he well knor that interrence with the institutions of any country for the purpose 'of producing a reaction and establishing absolutism would be the commencement of his own ruin. I have good reason to beleve that the conduet of the'oImperial Government [Wto Spain has been mostpright and honest, and it is still ergagedin removing Crom the frontiar the remains of what bight threaten her tranquillity. It ofdesires that Spain shouhld profit by her repose from civil strife to rdevelope her i3nmense resources, which have so long remained fruitless, and her wish is that the present Government shouldebe consolidated. WYith respect to a rumour w hich has circulated among the partisans of MIaria Christina here, that remonstirances had been made by the French Government to the Spanish on the internal state of the country, I can say that it is moat ufounded, and, moreover, that for a long time past the relations between the two Govermnents have not been better than at the present moment. - '- Wc reed in a letterfromMadrid-of the 3d inst.:" The Credit Monilier Company is only waitieng the sanetion of its stutes by the overnment to conastiute itself definitively and 'commence operations.

A meeting of the British residents oftParis, in aid of " The NWightingale F3und," will take place at the British EGmbassy on Wednesday next, at 11 o'clock in the forenoon, Mr. Henry Baring, M.P., in the chair. The following private telegraDhic despatch has been received " Psr.,~ Mrch 7. "Tho last news from St. Petersburg states that General Williams has left Tiflis for Moscow in recovered health." 31arshal Vaillant, Minister of War, has received the following letter from the Emperor:- " Monsieur le Mar6chal,-My attention having been. direct4d to the la'cours of the Councils of Revision, which have such great influence on the good constitution of the army, I charged General Niel, one of my aides-de-camp, to make researchesfrom the dat fmurnished to me by tho report -en- the recruiting of the army sent in every year. It results from this examination that even when the annual contingent was only 80,000 men, there were some departments rich in ablebodied men but which, novertheless, admitted into their contingent as much as 9 per cent. of young men set down as either infirm or too. weak to be admitted into the various corps; that is to say, that the Councils of Revision, by receiving a great number of young men unfit for service, and who were for that reason refused at the moment of their-incorporation, sacrificed for a local interest which it is difficult to eplain the interest of the army and of the country, for if these corps accept them they encumber the army with unserviceable men and fill the hospitals, or if they are refused the annual contingent is diminished, and in both cases the Government is compeUed to increase the numberof the follow. ing years contingent, and thus render the charge more heavy onthe population. It may, moreover, be calculated that each manwho is refused on reaching the corps and sent back to his family coststhe State 250f. The table annexed to this letter applies to 1854, when the contingent was carried up to 140,000 men: therefore, the number of men refused having been -5,694, the Treasury siuffered a dead loss of nearly l,500,000f. In order to prevent a recurrence of sinoi- lar abuses, I desire that in the annual report which you will i make to me on the recruiting of the army you will specifg the departments which have had the fewest men of their contingent refused by the corps and those which have had the mnost. This classification will stimulate the zeal of the Prefects and of the members of the Councils of Revision; for it is evidentthat they will deserve the greater praise as the numberof men refused is less. From the returns of 1854 there are most strikng differences between several de-. partments. In the Orne, for instance, the number of young men not examined was only 4 per cent., and, although the department is very poor in recruitable population, only one out of 100 was afterwards refused. The Council of Revision, therefore, did its duty conscientiously. In the Nord, on the contrary, 25 out of 100 were left unexamined ; and such a great number of weak or infirm men were passed that those afterwards refused amounted to 11 per cent., and among them were nine substitutes, which is stil more inescusable. In the MoseUe the operations of the recruitment produced results still more to be regretted. The number of young men unfit for the service comprised in the contingent amounted to more than 14 per cent., and 21 substitutes were passed by the Council of Revision, although their infirmities were such that they were refused a, few days after, on reaching their corps. According to the annexed table, it was in the departments of the Alier, the Creuse, the Orne, the Sadne-et-Loire, and the Haute-Vienne, that the operations were best carried out; the contrary being the case in those of the Gironde, the Herault, the Moselle, the Nord, and the Seine-et-Oise.

-ITHE BBITISH EBGMN LEGION. On Saturday mornfig. a-revIew of the British German Legion by Majdr-Gteneral Wetheral Adjatant-General, and the presentation by hiim of a set of Royal and regimental,colours, by command of Her. fajesty, to one of'the regimentsof which it is compoed, and now about to proceed to the East, imparted an unwonted deg,ree of aiiniatibn. and interest to the whole camp at -Sh6inclifl'e, where it has been principally trained. for .active service during the last year. This foreign auxiliary legion, now fast aproaching completion, will ultimately consist of two regiments of jiagers (rifes), six: regiments of light infantry, and two of light dragoons, making an aggregate force of about lO,00fmen, and -will be divided into two brigades of infantry and a brigade of cavaIry. Besides these; -two depOt regiments will eventu'ally be formed, one for each brigade, and -of the same strength as the other regiments. The fi-st brigade, consisting'of the IstKJaiger Corps. and the Ist, 2d, and 3d Light Infantry Regiments, is now stationed at Kululee, under the command of Brigadier Wool-. ridge, formerly colonel on the staff of General Sir De Lacy Evans im Spain; andthree companies of the 1st Light Infantry are at Sinope, protecting Government stores. jThe 2d Jiiger Corps and the 4th Regiment of Light Infantry are now'at Shorn_liffe,- complete and ready for service, and are destined to proceed to Scutari in 10 days or a fortnight. - The 1st and 2d Light Dragoon regiments, also at- Shomeliffe, at present want their full complement both of men and horses: Each regiment 'of cavalry, when complete, wil muster 600 horses and 775 men, and each regiment of infantry 1,077 men. The 5th Regiment of Light Ifantry, now in course of rapid formation in Heigoland, will be complete in about 10 days,.. and 700 of them (the present numerical strength of the regiment) will be removed to E;liorn. c.bffe towards the end of this week. The 6th Light Infantry is also being embodied at Shorncliffe, and wll probablybe complete by the end of the present month. The soldiers composing the legion have been collected from- nearly every p-at ofGermany, but principally in Hanover, Brimswick, Schleswig-Holstein, Oldenburg, Mecklenburg, the Prussian Rhenish provinces, Bavaria, Nassau, and Hesse, including someBelgians. They count in their ranks, as; non commissioned officers or privates, many young men of superior education and good families, and, in some instances, soldiers whohave served as subaltern'officers indifferentParts of Germany. The whole force is under the command of Major-General Baron Stutterheim, who formerly served with General Sir De Lacy Evans in Spain, and lately held a command in the army of SchleswigHolstein. This offlcer, by whose indefatigable exertions, in spite of almost insuperable difficulties and discouragements, the legion has been embodied and brought to its present satisfactory state of efficiency, has endeared himself to the whole corps, officers as well asmen, by an habitual course of kind and considerate conduct, without in the least relaxing the necessary rigours of discipline. He will leave Shorncliffe in a few days with his stafl and proceed to Constantinople to take commnand of the two brigades of infantry and the brigade of cavaly.. The officers of the cavalry are chiefly English, and those of the infantry almost wholly German. The ceremony of Satuiday possessed considerable interest. The day was fine, and many of the inhabitants of the adjacent towns of Folkestone, Sandgate, and Hythe attended to witness it. About halfpast 10 o'clock Major-General Wetherall, accompanied by Major-General Stutterheim and the officers of his staff, and Colonel Kimloch, appeared upon the ground. At that time the two reguments of cavalry, the 2d lager ifle) Corps, and The 4th Regiment of Light Infantry were draWn up in line,forming two sides of a square, and as the Adjutant-General approached they presented arms, and the bands of the several regiments played the national anthem. The cavalr were under the command of Colonels Percival and leming ,; the 4th Light Infantry, of Lieutenant-Colonel Humphrey; and the Rifles, of the Hon. S. Jocelyn. General Wetherall-havmng ridden along-the line and closely inspected the men and horses, an open square was formed, consisting of the two regiments of Light Dragoons on the right, and the Rifles on the left,-the 4th Regiment, to which the colours 'were presented, occupying the centre. The Rev. Mr. Wilmans, Field Chaplain of the 2d Brigade; then proceeded to consecrate the colours, which- were raised on two pyramids of muskets. MajorGeneral Wetherall then, addressing the regiment, said it was his pleasing duty, by comnmand of Her Majesty, to present those colours to them, and it would be their duty to defend them, consecrated as they had been by the ceremony -which they had witnessed. Colours, he added, became the soldier's altar, on which he vowed allegiance to his Sovereign, and in defending whose honour he defended his own. He hoped, in the field to which they were about to be called they would seek to emulate, should occasion offer, those deeds of heroism which would distinguish the recent campaign above every other for all time. Baron Stutterheim rendered the Adjutant-General's address into German, and at his suggestion the soldiers gave three hearty cheers for the Queen. The cavalry then marched past, first at a walk, and then at a brisk trot; and the infantry, first in open columns of companies, and then in double columns of companies to the centre, after the manner of the German column of attack. The Adjutant-General subsequently made a minute inspection of the arms and accoutrements of each company, passing up:and down both the front and rear ranks. He was also shown over some of the barrack* huts, and expressed his, satisfaction at the cleanly and orderly state in which they were, as also with the manner in which the regimental accounts were kept.
MusI AT OxrOBD.-A doctor's degree in music has been recently taken in Oxford, with distinguished success, by 3fr. E. G. Monk, precentor of St. lPeter's College, I-ladley. The exercise-which consisted of a muisial setting (for vocal solos, chorus, and orchestra) of Gray's weUlAiown poem, 2lte Bard-was publicly porformed in the great SheldoMan Theatre, before an audience of upwards of 3,000 persons, among whom. was -the Vice-Chancellor and -the chuef dinitaes of the University (in state and aJr number of students. The reception of the Ode was hgy flattering to the new Doctor. Three pieoes weree ncoredviz., the "Incantation chorus," an air, "Girt with mnany a baron bold" (rung by Thomas, from London),-andthe final chorus, an elaborate fugue in eight voice-parts throughout, in which the air of Gwod save -the Queen" is allofted to the brass instruments as a canto femo. THE. BURNOPF.LD MURDil.--Ss GunAn D=AEA. -In referenceo to this case, we have to place on record a circumstance of a very remarkable and even siffecting natuse, which, however it may be accounted foror disbelieved, is nevertheless perfectly true. Mr. Stirlix3's parents, who, it will be remembered, reside near !Wsbarton, on the Clyde, having been inDurham, during the assizes, attending the court f6r the purpose of hearing the tral of the alleged murderers of tleir son, and-the statement which we subjoin is from l,ir.

In a short time a ran, with a dark complexion and dark dress looked it upon her at the nindow, presented a gun, and.discharged it at her.-. 4t this juncture,, she awoke in g-reat alarm and trepidation; and since then, the dream-m6st strongly MpeEedluponiher mmid, by-the fact of her son's nurder, intelligence of, which would notreach her until 6 or 7 days later than the dream-has ever been vivid in her recollection.

* CAST-IRON ORDNVANCE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMS. Sir,-Under the head of "Naval and Military Intelligence," on the 1st inst., you stated that a schooner had arrved atWoolwich withgunsandmortars fromLow3foor, and, under the saine head, on the 3d., that the War Department had contracted with the Acadian Iron Company for a supply of iron; and that "ieih such means of procurin superior gun metal Goverunment ill be relieved of Ethat] dependence onforeig countries for an article of the greatest importance, which England herself has not the means of producing." Afew days ago mr. 3IonseU stated in the House of Comnons that he was 'Iashamed to say that our iron ordnance was inferior to that of any other country in the world," and that "to remove the reproach" he asked for a ~vote of 60,OOOJ or 70,0DO. in order to establsh a gun foundry. Asthereappearstobeacdesiratoinjure, aswethink, njustly, the reputation of British manufacturers, we shall be obliged by your insertig the results of experiments made at Wool-wich about seven years ago, in order to test the'relative merits of English ad foreign guns. The foreign gans tried were cast in Belgilun, for the exprces purpose of testing their strength against English-made gns- and they, were snnufactured under the imniediate directions of Colonel )andi% the then Inspector of Artillery. The guns, Ena,lish and Belgian, of 32-pounder calibre, were fired with gradually increoased charges of powider until they burst, the:latter rounds being fL-ed wvith 1fib,of powder, three shots, and two wvads, the ordinary sernice charge being dli,. of 'powrder, one shot, and one wad. The results were-as follows:- ow Moor gun, 32-pounder of 42cwt.-14S rounds fired, 1,1281b.of powder and 404 shot expended. Belgian gun, 32-pounder.-109 rounds fired, 9591b. ofpowder and 287 shot expended. -A 'scond gunstood l1O rounds. Forty rounds double shotted were fired Ifrom. each- gun; the subsequent rounds with three shot and two wads. Another, experiment wasa .made with an S-inch gun of 65cowt.-,cast at -Lo w Xoor,the usual service charge for which is 10!b. of powder and-one' hollow shot.. In this experiment the chlrges (fiied aith two hollow shot) avere gradualy increased to 231b. .of powder, and; after the gOun had stooda 0 roundsin this way, it was fired with 20ib.of pder -and two solid shots and burst on -the 243d round.

Mr.Dove was dressed, ;nd sat up is a chair by the bedsde. She appeared in grat pa and complained very much of her legg. I asked-Jf she had any pai in her head, and she said'" iNo." We'got her into bed, andawhen doing so she seized my hand. She- was then twitching. Sbe jfused to-drink anything cold. We rabbed her feet;- arms5, !nd hands. She gra;sped myleft'laud very tightly, and the pressure she gave was at intervals. She threw her head hack when she had twitches.- -Directly deceased was touched or when cold water wras put'to her lip5 thetwitchesreturned.: We tried her with medicine, and. gave her some mint-tea, which threw her into a persnira. tion. It was hot, and did not seem tio relieve her. Idon't recollect howlong the twitches continued-it migat be some hours. I never saw her sufferfrom twitchesbefore. Subse. qulently I left her and went into my own houst; I think 1 returned again in the afternoon, but 'can't recolle. I had asked her if she felt spas=m in the stomnach, but shis aid she did not.

On Wednesday, the 27th nit., she was attacked: by these twitches, and was bad for eight or nine hours.- I sa Mrs. Dove on Thusday and Friday, the 28th and 29tl it., and she ws then attacked by these twitches, which-grew more intense at every seizure.

He administered the medicine in a wineglass; it was of a dark colour; and Mrs. Dove druniit off;' aid then asked me for a mint lozenge, saying thu potion a.s very hot.

Mrs. Wood told her totrytoputit off. Mrs Dove cried out, almost immediately afterwards, to Mrs. Wood, " You come to my back." Her back was then arcIed outwards, and the twitches came on the same as before. When she got hold bf my hand I could not release it: I could not o;n her fingers, her hands were quite clinched, amd she thew her head violently back. She pressed Mr. Wood's fingers so severely as -to hreak thesin. Her eyes vwere quite contracted, she could not see.

At -frst I-believe she, ws sensible, but soon after the commencement of the fe,tal attack she becameinsensible. The attack was veryviolent;her feet were arched outwards; and her bodyv was quite straight and rigid. We propped her up with pillows a little after 9 o'clock. We burnt some brovn paper and DUtit i under her nose to reviveher, but vithout effect. She looked as if she was in a fit of epilepsy. This condition continued until about20iminutes toll oclock.- About10 o'clock'3r. Dove came in, but -went out again on our su-gestion for medical assistance. The attack gradually became more violent. Mrs. Dove breathed -very badly all night, She did notfroth at the moath. I could hear the'mucus in her mouth, but it did not come out. This noise inthethroatcontinued durimg the whole attack. After Mrs. Dove ceased to speak she did not again become sensible. She was only sensible for about half an hour after the attack oommencedL We could scarcely lift her, owing to the stifhezs of her body. She was sometimes freefromm the spasmsforabout 10 minutes, and then they-woulld return with greater violence. Hei face was discoloured, and turned rlue somne shcrt timn before she died. She appeared to have an inclinatior to vomit, but could not do so. There was a rising oi heaving of her chest. Her pulse was feeble, and ait time. appeared to cease altogether. At the commencemen of the attack her hands were hot, but they becam quite cold afterwards. I gave her her medicine at half past 3 o'clocul on Saturday afternoon; it was theni on th washstand, from-which Mr. Dove took it.

£1 (IL SBBVZCE SUPSREW2VATION. This committeo met on Saturday in Rooin-T'o. 12; the Chancellor of the Mxchequer in the chair. Sir C. Trevelyan, was -agan nder examination for some time, ansd, after some exphazation of fomer evidence, said: -With reference to the question of the ag at which poeitments to the civil service should commence, hchog the that it should he left toat e commissioslers; ut that a time shonld be fixed wfhen, a person's energies begn nin to fiag, or, to use a Scotch phrase, "wvhen a man began to wea ry," he might be permitted to retire at discretion. This was desirable both for the-punblic service and. the interests of tho civil servants themselves, that they should. not he tied. to the service without any prospect of cessation from labour. In the original draught of the hill this period was fLxed at 60 years of age. The next point to consider was the age at which the civil servants should be compelled to retire. Under all circumstances, he thought that 65 was that age, e.xcept in special cases, mhere peculiar knowledge and experience might render it desirable to retain them, even supposing their energy and activity had somewhat failed. Sir Charles went on to mention the number of years' service which entitled to superannuation allowance, stating it commenced at 10 yeari, and vas carried:on to 3L when 40-GOths of the alary mighutoe granted. The average ege of admission to the service had been hitherto-under 20; but, under recent anangements, the futtiie average might probably be set down at 40. Under the new. scale there were sux-years during which civil servants continued to serve without any addition to their suparannnation allowance, and he considered tlhis a most imperfect arrangement. The age from 50 to 60 was the most valuable period of a man7s service, and it was most desirable to encourage public servants of that age to remain. The allowance should, therefore, increase until the time for compulsory retirement. He thought two-thirds of the salary too great a deduction uLpon retirement. Mr. Bromley, Accountant-General to the Navy, was then examined, and stated he had passed through all the several gradations of a clerl's career, and had held his present situation since the cormencement of the war, and was appointed to it without any solicitation on his part. There were 160 clerks in his department, and he was therefdre fullyaequainted with the subject before the committee. The witness's evidence was to the same efect as that given by Sir-Charles Trevelyan, and he -went fnlly into all the objections urged by the civil servants against the system of abatement from their salaries, saying they were flxed by the Government for the amount of work done, and. were not sufficient to bear the deduction of 6 per cent. In answer to a question by the comitutee, Witness stated the difference between the rate of remuneration; hours of attendance, and leave of absence at the North-Westemn Railway, the Bank of England, asn the India-house, and compared them with the Government offices,-and said he was most decidedly of opinion that the condition of the former was far superior to that of the latter. He spoke mnerely from facts within his own knowledge, and regretted that the matter appeared to be regarded from a Treasury point of view, and not a Cnstom-house one-; from the high saaries of clerks in the Secretary of Stat's-office, and not fromthe lower salaries of clerks in the Custom-house, Post-office, wocr * After a long discussion as to the meaning of the words "Superannuation Fund" in thec act of 1834, The committee adjourned until Tnesdav next.
THf TROOPS IN THE WF}ST INDIES. TO TElB FI)I0 OF THE TDIES. Sir,-Asit appears tobe the determiniationofthemlilitary authorities at home that the regiments now in the West Indies-viz, the 36th, 67th,and 69th, should complete their period of foreign service in those islandA, I take the aiberty, through the mnediinm of your rcoluns, of representing the greatandgross- injustice doneto those regiments bythusexacting from them more than double their legitipaate portion of West Indiatsrvice. These three regiments have now en-.. tered on their ninth year of service abroad, and nearly com. pleted their fifth year in these colonies, and have during that period gono thriugh half a dozen epjdemics (at the least) of cholera and yellow fever. -The 67thHegiment, which has been detached in three different islands for the last four years, required and received 200 men in I5 to complete its establishment of 600 men.

But where there is a llthereisaway, andI would venture to point outtothe Secretary of - State for War that it is very feasible and practicable to despatcli one of the Crimean regiments, which as3 under orders for the-West Indies vhen the war broke oDt in 1S54,1 and:wbich must now be compoed of very yousigsoldiers, and,. aoreover, have received a large pro- portion of -rewards and -honours,- to this and the.

.DUZTEP4TXON OF FOOD,P &c ..his oonimiiLee mot on Yxiday in room iNo. i7, Mr. 'Scholefield-in the chair. Mr. WlliaEm Eminerson the sira witness, saia hie was ihaunager'of the People's Ihour Mill, at Leeds. The society was established in 1847, in conseQUience of the general feeling'of the dearness and impurity of food. It consisted of 3,100 members, chiefly of the working classes, >iL&the amount of business done was nearly SO,0001. per annum, representing a quantity of 400 quarters of grain per week, and the number of persons', supplied was about 20,000, and nothing was soldbst purewheat. The society was incorpo-rated under the Trovident Societies Act, and there were several others of the same description at Leeds, Bradford, and other places. No proprietor could hold more than one guinea share, and upon this they received 5 per cent, initerest, aud.a bonns according to the profit nsade. The ongina subscriptions to the society amounted io 4,3981., and 912891t had been returned as bonus; The liability of the sfarebolders ws not limited, and any lQss would fall.upons the .shareholders generaly. Theresult of the society's'o rations had been toiraprove the quality of flour and i to. lower the price; but witness was of opinion that at present there was no sufficient check to the geeral psactice of adalteration, and thati it required Voverninent interference. 'The feeling of the people was in favour of such interference, as the wotldn- classesI were now deterred from any prosecutions through fear -of its interfering with their ens of subsistence. Witness read to the committee a letter addressed to the Lad-s Mercury by Mr. C. L. Dresser, dated Octoberl2,' *1855, which statedthat he had anayzed five samples of bread purchased at different bakers in Leeds, and found in one. sample 41b. of alum to 20 stones-of flour; in another, 31b. 80z.; in a third, 31b.; in a fourth, 21b. 4oz.; and in -the fifth,ztb. of alus in 20 stones of - flour, and that such *an adulteration was mostsnjursous to the human system. Mr. Ferrand, bookkeeper to a corn-mill society in Rochdale, said, 'when he first joined the society there were great complaints as to the colour of thebread, and in conseeuenco they adopted the use of alum; but, oving to the ngitation throughout the country, the eyesof the people had been opened to the folly of requiring the bread to be made -white at theuese of its purity, and in consequence the use of alum hadbeen discontinued by the society, and its bsiness had since largely' increased. He could confirm the statements- of the last witness as to the general daisre among the working classes for some protection against adulteration, and, as an instance, he might mention that atRo6hdale there was an association of working men, oa31ed the Co-operative Store Society, for the purpose of supplying the members with pure articles of food, &c., at the lowest possible prices, and that it had its origin in the difeiculty experienced by the working classes in procuring unadulterated articles ehlewhere. Dr. Challis said he was a physician, residing in Bermondsey, and ha7obad some experience in that district upon the subject of adulteration. In the firstplace, the adulteration of breadwas most extensivly pratised, even by the best bakers, who had admitted to hiM that they used 120z. of alum to 140 loaves-a quantity most injurious to the health of all classes, more especially of the poor, as, owing to many causes, their stomachs w.ere ruable to digest it so well as others. The nuantity of aluma mentioned was the RtniniUcsn and he (Dr. Challis) totally disagreed with the statemeent that had been made that the constitution of the alum was so changed during the process of baking as to be rendered innoxious. The heat required to bake the bread would not be sulcient to cause the change, and he had himself found crystals of alum in bread. It was added to save trouble to the baker; and there was no necessity for its use, as the addition of a little more salt would produce the same effect, and be harmless. As a medical man, he was of opinioa the use of alum would affect the teeth and gums, and more especially the mucoas membrane of children, producing at one time constipation and at another relaxation. He had not detected any other adulteration, but rice was largely used, which was a fraud on the public. A saek of flour mixed with 401b. of rice would make 116 quartern loaves while a sack of pure flour would -make only 95. With regard to beer, he could confirm the previous evidance as to the addition of some intoxicating ingredient, but whether cocculus indicus or tobacco, as lie sometimes suspected, it was difficult to determine. He had seen a mau in a state of coma after drinling a single pint of beer at a publichouse, and it was therefore evident there must have been some serious adulteration. He might mention that in poor nei,ghbourhoods it was a matter of notoriety that the meat exposed for sale was generally diseased; the viscera showed that the animal had died, or been inr dying state when it was killed. He knew of one instance of a butcher who never ate a morsel of the meat he sold himself for this reason, and lie (Dr. Challis) believed that the disease called the carbuncle, whch had much increased among the lower classes, was to be traced to the extensive use of diseased meat. Even the higher classes were not exempt. Although therewere inspectorsappointed, yet there was a regular market for the sale of diseased meat, and not one case im ten vas ever prosecuted, and even then it was difficult to procure a conviction, as in the recent ease which oceurred at Erith, wlhere a man was prosecuted at the Central Criminal Court for attempting to sell the Carcass of a buUloclk wlichhadbeentharownoverboardfrom avessel. It was taken to Leadenhall-market, but before it could be delivered to the wholesale dealer the man was taken into custody, andat the trial, after treating the matter very lightly the man was acquitted, on the ground that he had not sold the meat. He (Dr. Challis) would next mention the adulteration of mustard. In a medical point of view the adulteration oEf this article might be mostserious. As aninstance, a child was very il, and a mustard poultice was ordered, but no effect was produced, and further measures were deemed useless, and the child died. The mustard in this case failed to produce its proper effect because it was adulterated with flour and turmeric. 'In fact, it was becoming the customn among the profession to substitute spirits of turpentine sprinkled on fiannel for mustard poultices. The adulteration of arrowroot, wine, and coffee he couldoonfirm, as well as thlt of drugs generally. In the latter case it was notorious that as soon as a drug became extensively used something ese was sold for it, and his own prescriptions had failed owinng to the impurities of the drugs. In conclusion,I he thou ht that a power might be given to the vestries,under Sir B. hall's-newanct, to deal with the question of adulterations in their various districts. . - - - Mr. Rufus Uisshur, a grower ofEnB-glish rhubarb at Ban.. bury, inreply totheevideneegivenbeforethecommittee, hich carg. him with sellinga spurions article inferior to the foreign rhubarb, read the opinion of the latDr. Pereira, to the effect thatthe English rhubarb was equal to thehbestforeign The vritness said the English rootwas used by many medical men, and the demand for it was gradually increasing. The price varied from 4d. Per paouna to 2s.for the best, w,hile the foreignhad cost latelye.per pound. hMr. E. Gay, superintendent of the mustard department of Her Majesty's Victualling-yard, Deptford, said that owing to the universal adulteration of mustard the Govermmeent hadlately takenthe preparation of it into their own hands. Previous to his present appointment witness had had 30 years' experience as a master drug grinder. He had always found it impos5dble to purchase genuine mustard, I and the adulteration generally wasmade to pleesethe public eye, as the pure mustard flour, after being mixed 24 hours' becameblack, and people did not like it. They wero accustomed to have it yellow, and therefore turmeric and dour were used, with sometimes cayenne and ginger. In some samples in the Government stores he had detected 5oz.'of gypsum to llb. of mustard, and ia another 6oz. of wheat tlour, and sometimes 50 per cent, of gypsum It was in-consequence of the discovery of these adulterations that the present department was established. The mustard now Issued to the lRoyal navy was perfectly -pure. It was packed in tin canisters and. hermetically scaled, and would keep gDod for years. There was a most simple and instantaneous test for the adulteration of mnustard by turmeric-viz., by adding even a single drop of spirit of amnmonia, when, if the mustard were pure, no change would take place, but if turmeric were present it ould irmmediately tlin it red. From experiments witness had made lie found there was as such essential oil remaiung in the husks of the mustardlas in the flour itself, and if mDixed weith any other meal it would have the same efect upon the taste, and no doubt this was one source of adulteration. Mdany cases it wAs impossible to detect, as, for instauce, where "catsick," a species of wild mustard, was used,- even by the microscope no difference could be observed. In chicory he had known Venetian red and treacle used, and One person in SLUrty had grown 700 tons of carrots and 350 tons of parsnips mn a year, -ehich were sold for chicory-in the proportion of 25 to 75 pve cent. Ie had had much ex-perience in druggrinding for the traAe, and lie knew that the practice of adding sawdust anld other things for the purpose of sdulteratiori waS almost universal. During the timhe v was- in business he very seldoem sent out a genuine article, being compelled to' add the adulterating substances by. order of the wyholesale houses. -The- practice had been muclt increasing, and he {Mr.. Gay) had dono as much;as any manu inthetradeinadulterating, aid- as inuch as any man to expose it; and many an honest tradesman would be glad to do away with the practice, bt was coepelled at rpresent to adopt it, in conseqeence of the corgpetition ot dishonest traders. Sometimes the adulterating article. bad ceen sent to him to grind with the originlal, and -at -others -hevwas ordered to procure and''add it. - Aumong the -adulterated drugs were rhubarb, jalap, and cocculus icdicus. :The only use for the latter was to put into the poor MRmans drink. In short,- he might say he bad not one customer pin his books who didnot require himto adulterate the drugs sent to be ground, although many of them exceedingly Tegretted the necessity. His evidence chiefy applied to the neighbourhood of Leeds, although he bad badx or seven years' experience in London, -but would- not lko to gve an opinion as to the general practice of the trade there. nere was no doubt, however, that in maost cases the adulteiated drugs -were chiefl for the low neighb(nrhoods. iTEness -et- on to enumerat seea- rilso of -toaywid wrmoeorlsadtrtd,and said that millswas'slowprinipaly mied wth bIled "whte

Chippendale), a gentleman of extrem-ely hmble origin,rwho, having nade Iis-fortune in the EastIndies, has comfortably settled in Derbyshire, with Isis ward, Clara Fielding (Miss Swanborough). Here 'he is surrounded by a group of " genteel" friends, consisting of MIr. Walm_ley- (Mr. W. Farren), a fashionable young gentleman, to whom he hopes to marry.

Aid this is precisely vwhatwe cannot exiplain, so as to convey any notion 'f the general effect of the yiece It might be supposed that lack of incident having left the author free fora careful developmeat of 'character, he has conjured up a num'ber of highly colouredEndividualitiesorpersonifHenbstrations, He has done nothing of the kind. vf the characters arewithout the flesh and blood of reality, they are eqnally without the exaggeration f 'caricature.- They all talk exceedingly well, in a comedy language far above the level wyhich is, generally written for the modern stage, and there is scarcely a line wh'ich does not bear the mark of carefel osh. are, therefore, inclined to conclude thaConreve school has- been contemplated by the author, Mr. Bayle Bernard, and that he has voluntarily laid aside that constructive skill with which he has so often amused the public that he may try the effect of dialogue only-dialoguae, a's distinguished-even from the exhibition of character. We fear that this is not the a-e fitted for the experiment. - The pieeo was admirabiy acted in the -principal parts especially hb Miss Reynolds, Mr. Buckstne, and an Compton. T'he character of Lady Aurora is faintly drawn, hut, by her graceful air, by her unweariedvivacity, by her significant by-play, and, lot us add, by her dress, MKiss Reynolds yae an-ineffable charm to the part-, over assisting the play in those places where assistance wras most needed. The hearty, eccentric Tom Ripstone was endowed writh all the " fun" of which he wvascapable by Mr.-Buckstone, whose niamner of defeating a contumacious adver,saryt by justhinting the possessionof someivportantecrest, and the jshrrvingoffonpurpose to be calledbaok, wasthecauseof many ahearty roar. 2But. perhaps, the mos' remarkable delineation in the piece is Mr. Compton's representation of Joe Withers, a veteran postman, whorm we have not mentioned in our survey of the plot. The picture of the old mana, vaindy rumnnagifig his memory for incidents that have occurred within the-las half-hour, but often inconveniently quick and xeady 'with the reminiscences of his youith, is as perfecta little bit of character painting as one would -wish to see. Let us add that this is the partrost definitelydravm by the author. - As for the mist-en scen4 we are not goinig too -far'when w,e term it maLgnificent, albeit the decorations merely resent the house and grounds of a country gentleman. M residence is a perfect paradise of parserra and verandahs At the end of the piece the applause was unanimous, and Mr. Rayle-Bernard responded to calls for the "auteho"'with a bow from a private box.
CONVCERT OF SrGNOR PICCO. The performances of the !Sardinian3llnstrel"-as Signor :icco is named by his countrymen-have been m-ch t33ked of in the last two yesrs by travellers from Italy. Eis praises have bee. sung in strains of nnmeasured enthusiasm atl2aples, Reome, Jilan, Pinas, and other large cities. The fact of his having been born blind, and the Imowlledge that he was self-taught, of course inspire no little interest f bat the greatest astonisiment arises from the very singular instrument throngh the medium of whicb. his mnusical talent is disn1a d. The pipe upnwhich Si. oPicco perform=, ancl wtil his admirers ye clas ca b - siated the adtoraf tibia, is neither mnore nor less than a 'w:histle; but upon this whistle the young "I instrel" plays with a skll nothing short of marveHous. To produce a s'weet and ^a icaZ tone from such an instrunent is mate3ially impossible; the apostrophisers of the "dulect malady' attributed to thejpatoral tibia are thelrfore ia this instance more fanciful thar. inst, and would be prone to award aprizetoPanratherthan to Apollo. BatthatSipnor Tieco has subdued and temperzed its natural sirillness in a xemarkable degree is tree. The ineans or&ginaty athis conmnand, when, a lad, the so~n of some huinble shepherd, he wandered abolt his native hills and strovo to create a, little 'vorld of his ownv, to. 'compensze4 for that which he was destined from the first never to behold, are, incredhbly insignificant. But what may not perseverance and indomitstble vil ashieve' The pipe upon which Signor Pico now discourses so fluently, in the presenco of perplexed and Wondering audiences, is. precisely simnilar to that which he cut and fashioned forhimself, manyyqars mBwe (he is now only 25), in thIe forests of Sardmin. Theinstrumnt, which is so small that in the act of mani, lation his fingers render it almost invisibl% is plerced wvitl three holes arid an aperture at either extremalty. The player, therefore, has four open or natural notes at commnd, all the rest being formed in an artificial manner ard -with extraordinary ingenuity. Signor Picco' hAs contrihed matnea v the lower aperture of, the wVistle which he manornuvxes with his index and mniddle -~fingr, avswer a similarI purpose to that obtained througn the esereise of the han within the hell of a hbrn; bymieas of: which articial notes are produced. . Through what peculiar mechanism, however, he suooeeds in getting so 'iide a Tange of gamut,. howv he obtains a close and rapidl hske on severaL notes, land manages the soft echo, orpianissiiro,' which in relation to the other tones may be comparedo- harmonics on- a violin, we cannot pretend to guess; and, indeed, these features of his performance (the natue of the instrument considered) defy calculation. - The pieces introduced on Saturday nighit in thie B1anover,squarellems, wheni Signor ~Picco made his first appewarnce before an Enigltish audience .

The will in question bore date on the 14th of January, 1855, and gave the buik of her property to her nephew, Mr. George Reece, by whom at her request it -was drawn up. There was proof of testamentary capacity; the will was carefully read over to her, aDd there wgas sulliient evidence to show thAt she had a perfect knowledge of its contents.

FREDERICK CAVENDISH, Laeuzenant-toionei. Chestoifield, March 7. Ayot St. lawrence, Welwyn, Mfarch4. Sir,-In your speech in the debate reported in iThe Trimsza of Saturday, the Ist inst., you refer to "a secret inquiry somewhat remorkable in its circumsiances," and you state that " there 5ws an imputationu made affecting the charater of an officer of high rank connected ivith two ar three ducal fauilies-an imputation certainly very discreditable. Itwas brought, in the firs& instance, before the late Duke of YWelington, and I venture to think that npon thatoccasin the illustaious Duke did not poceed with all the equity which might have been expected and was to be deLired Thepapers were taken away and locked up. However, it as happened that the matter was brought us.der lubli disdission, andthen it became desirable to take some step which would save cetainnoblefamiliesfromannoyance; andwh3twas done? There vas a Board, as it wa called; two or three old gentlemen of my acquaintance were placed on it and one or two of them were in so low a state of health that they were quite unable to examine minutely and srupulously into a difficult and disputed question. Bu3tt alawyerwas givent6 assistthem-aDleputyJudge-Advocate-GeneraL" AsyouhAvethusbroughtthis subiectbefore thepublic, and as your statement is inla great measureincorrect and likely to lead to nisconception, where there should be none, I feel it my duty to ask you to allow me to state what actually did eccur.on the occasion you-refer to. A gross and unfounded charge was made against my father in March, 1848, to the late Commander-in-Chief, ad, as you say, -was not properly dealt with at the time, Sor it was silenced, without my father being made aware that anything of the Idnd had occurred. On the 19th of November, 1852, my fatherheard, for the firt time, that this charge had been repeated to the present Commander-in-Chief, and he immediately applied to the Commander-in-Chief to cause a public, solemn, and immediate investigation into this malignant and secret charge; this was most strongly urged, but as strongly refused by the Commander-in-Chief, and the Court yon allude to summoned to inquire into the charge, and my father, a General oficer, was told he must abide by its decision. I will only state that little or no evidence was gone into by that Court, and that any evidence that might have led to a fait acquittal or to a fair condemnation, on either of -which my father stood, was set aside by the Deputy-JudgeAdvocate-GeneraL You fuither state that '-some gentlemen of rank and position had come forward and said they could not think that the officer in question, their friend, so honourable a man, could have dons anything to forfeit good opinion." No gentlemen came forward on this occasion to say less than that the charg was preposterous, nor in any y to scren a man of rank and family frot the consequences of such an a,rN if proved aganst him; and I myself would have stood aloof from the man I honour most had there been a shadow of a doubt'in the minds of all honourable and unprejudiced men of his innocence of a charge brought against him inthe first instance by an angry spirit, and afterwards promulgated secretly through the society he lived in by a vicious and vindictive one, supportodhythe testimony of prejudiced minds; but, even further than this, after the finding of the Court my father applied to the Commander-in-Chief to reconsiderhia firstapplicationfor a trialon oath, whichhepositively declined doing, butrecommendedthatmyfathershould let the subject rest, and treat the author of the charge and his supporters with the contempt which their despicable conduct deserved. This he and his family, though much ,ggeved,ihave done till now, when your words imply that he was screened rather than acquitted. I have the honour to be, Sir, yours obediently, W. HL FREDERICK CAVENDISH. You wil much oblige me by an answer to Burlington-gardens, Bond-street. I;eutenant- General Sir De Lacy Evans, G.C.B. Bryanston-square, March 5. Sir,-I am much obliged to you for your letter containing information asto an important omission and some inaccuracies in the allusions Imade, in a recent debate, to the case of General Cavendish. We had been told that the Commission on the Crimean Report was to be entirely, or partly, a secret one. It was my wish to show- that the proceedings of such a tribunal would probably be deemed unsatisfactory by the public. It appeared to me that the result as stated in the public journals of the former commission I alluded to was a cogent illustration of what may be anticipated in the instance of any similar commission, because its result, as I understood, gave no satisfaction to any of the parties concerned, and the more so because of the strangely enigniaticalformofthefindingofthecommission. This I attributed to what you, I believe, also beiieve to have been the casemamely, that the commission seemed rather under the guidance of the technical lawyer attending it than under. that of its president. I avoided names and dates intentionally, but sill it appears the proceeding adverted to was obvious. My recollection must certainly have been in fault, and thus arose the omission to mention General Cavendish's urgent application to the Commander-in-Chief fora "public, solemn, and immediate investigation." But a still more important omissionwas that as to General Cavendish having again addressed the Commander-in-Chief, after the finding of the Court or commission, requesting a reconsideration of his original application for a public trial on oath. - Nothing could have been more honourable than this demand, and, hadI known or recollected it, it would certainly have been unfitting in me to have failed in mentioning it, and I much regret therefore this, on my part unintentional omission, and this may have led to the interpretation adverted to in the last line of your letter-a meaningwhich, under the circumstances of General Cavendish's reiterated demands for pubEc inquiry, neither I nor any one else has a right to convey. I have only to add that I thought and said then, and I: think now, that the course adopted by the late illustrious Duke cf WeDlington towrds General avendish was in aU its particulars utterly indefensible, and of grievous, unheard-of, and unexampled inequity. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, DE; ENY1VANS. To Colonel Cavendish. Buriington-gardens, March 5. Sir,-I :beg to thank you for your letter acknowledging the inaccuracies in your speech on the debate of last Friday, to which I caUed your attention in my letter yesterday. As you are now in po;session of the facts of the case, I trst you will have no objection to take the earliest opportaunity of correcting from your place in the House of Commons any miconception which may have arisen from the wording of your speech; and, as my father is now at. liberty togive publicity to all that has occurred in this matter, he is enabled, should you require it, to furnish you with any correspondence connected with the court of iiquiry in I have the honour to be, Sir, yours obedientl W. H. FREDERICK CADV iSHL To Lieutenant-General Sir De Lacy Evans, G.C.B. Bryanston-square, March 6. Sir,-I beg to acknowledge your letter, received last night, thanTing me for mine of the same date, which was couched in is satisfactory terms as in my power. Had the information I received on the 5th reached me on the 3d it would have afforded me pleasure io include this topic inthe statement I ws permittedto make on that day. Bat this is no longeroptional. It is well known asarule of the House not to advert to a former debate. This, I believe, was stated by the Speaker on Monday, and only a limited deviation is sometimes permitted. This indulgence was allowed on Monday, on which occasion, however, at its close, the determination of the House was nifested by the 3Mnisterial and Opposition leaders, the Speaker, and the members generally, not to allow any further violation of the rule respecting the debate in question. From pasages in your letter dated the 4th there appearto have been several circumstances connected with the court of inquiry of 1853, and its origin in 1848 with which the public have been unacquainted. It must tiherefore be very satisfactory to General Cavendish to be now at libert to give publity, as stated in your note, to all that occurredL B My letter of yesterday and this one are, of course, at his disposaL . I have the honour to be, Sir, yours obediently, DE LACY EVANS. Colonel Cavendish. Chesterfield, March 7. Sir,-I`begtoacknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th, stating that you are unable, so late, to make any allusion in the House of Commons to the debite of lFriday As it was necessary for me to communicate with Lord Hardinge 'before I, onmy father's part, was at liberty to address you on that subject, and, being at the time in the eountry, I did not receive that permission till Tuesday afternoon, which will account for your not receiving any communicat-on from me till after you hadmcade your second atement. in the House of Commons on Monday evening.

During the voyaege the Tamar experienced moderate weather to Lisborn, after which eastetly gales to South ampto31'. f News from Buenos Ayres is to the lst ult. latest particulars respecting the Costa invasion state tbat the invaders have been routed, and that Ramon Bxistos was killed, and Costa, with several others,-includting two Englishmen, one named Wills, a lieutenant of artillery-, and his adjutant,'taken prisoners. It was further reported that Costalhad died, and that 12 or 14 officers had been secured. The BriliPadet has published the documents relating to the defeat of lores, which took place on the 24th of January; and was followed by the invadon of Costa on the 28th of that month, whioh was effected in spite of the vigilance of steamers and other cruisers at Zarate, where he effected a landing, and took the town by surprise, deposing the justioe of the peace and naming another in his stead as an act of ocalsovereigaty. By a coincidence somewhat strange he discovered an ample supply of horses and daringly penetrated into the interior, passing the Capilla del Senor, and taking undisturbed possession of the VillW deLWuan. At this time, according to the accounts, the force of Costa amounted only to 200 men, partly negroes and partly Spanish 'Basques. Fromthis placehewas disturbed bythe approachof Colonel Conessa's force, and took a southerly direction, as if for Lobos or Chascomus. Beyond tnis nothing is known but the rumoured news of his defeat. It was said that General Urquizahad declared war agamst the Buenos Ayreans, but there was no foundation for the report. Although poltical affairs at Buenos Ayres were somewhat unsettled by the various rumours afloat, commercial matters had during the month remainted favourable, and more business had been done than was expected under all circamstances. This, however, has been principally confined to manufactured goods, as it usually happens that during the first month of the year little is done for the interior provinces. For Paraguay the principal articles in demand have been war steamers, guns, ammunition, and other warlike stores. Prices in general had not improved, and the stocks on hand were too large to expect such a result for some time.' The importation during the month was moderate. In articles of daily consumption the arrivals were heavy, especially from Spainand the United States. With the exception of sugar, the great articles of consumption had givenway, and were realized with diffliculty, even at reduced rates. In exports the Salderos had been active, and the quantity of produce despatched was very considerable. No stocks were allowed to accumulate, and the extreme scarcity of paper money had in part tended to check the spirit of speculation. The money-market had been stringent. Exchange on England during the week was quoted at 70 and 71; Spanish doubloons, 340. The Americcn bark St. Mary sailed from Buenos Ayres for London on the 24th cf January. The British schooner Bosphorus, for Liverpool, and the Arno and the Ann and John, for England, left on the 26th of January. The following British merchant vessels were at Buenos Ayres on the 30th of January :-The Jane Anna, 7 de Marzo, Jane Lakey, Daring,. Ipswich, Britannia, Cynthia, Cornucopia, Acorn, I0, EliZabeth Wood, Ferris, Gauntlet, Arethusa, Earl of Carlisle, William James, Sir H. Parnell, Viago, Crusader, Partisan, Barrack, Prince Albert, Onda, Dauntless, Alcona, John Hillman, Ann Best, Julia, Xathleen, Mmary, Spinner, Ulidia, Lord Raglan, Kyle, and Ocean Sprite. At -Montevideo the Minister of Government and Foreign Relations had tendered his resignation, which was accepted, and the portfolio handed over in the meantime to the Minister of War. Party feeling -ran very high, and the forthcoming elections were looked forward to with apprehension. Rio dates are to the 14th ult. A disagreement had taken place between Rear-Admiral Johnstone, comniandingthe British squadron in South America, and the Commodore of the United States' station in the same seas. It appears that a merchant steamvessel arrived at Rio, from the United States, under pretence of taking in coals, and carrying an American flag. Rear-Admiral Johnstone, being informed that the stranger had on board a great quantity of ammunition, &a., and that she was a Russian privateer, he, as well as the English Chag6 d'Affaires, demanded from the American commodore an explanation of the rumour, which he described as being entirely false. Inthe meantime the English and French vessels in harbour made ready to follow the American immediately she left the Rio waters,, it being believed that she was on a cruise to the Pacific, where on her arrival she would hoist the Russian fag. It was afterwards, however, discovered that the vesselwas not a Russian privateer, and the question had a friendly termination. The cholera had nearly disappeared from the empire, and there were only a few cases of a spasmodic character remaining. Exchange on London closed at 27A to 27g, with transac. tions to a regular extent; Paris 346 to 354 direct and indirect; Hamburg, 650; sovereigns were worth 8,800 to 8,900. Freights to the Channel were quotedcat 40so to 45s;; Ant'Werp, fts.; England, 40s.; Eamburg, 20s. to 40s:;, 3editerranean, 40s. to 50s.; Havre, 40f.; United -States, 5c. to 60c. Tlhe coffee-market had been exceedingly quiet, on-asc count of the high prices asked 'by dealers, and 'the Wales were very moderate. Hopes -were entertainad of an im. provement, on account of the cholera having disappeared,7 and lik;ewise owing to the improved state of the weather. There was plenty of coffee in the districts; but, in consequence of the increased value of the coffee bagging, dealers agreed to uinent 100 reis on the price of the bag, being tms 800 reis for single and 1,400 reis for double bags. The shipmitents fronm the 1st of February to date were 37,975 bgs. The sales during the month were 88,800 bags, of which 61,000 were for the United States, 6,300 forthe Mediterranean, 29,500 for the North of Europe, 2,000 for the Cape of Good Hope. Besides there were shipped for dealers' account 4,800 bags for the United States and 3,000 for the Mediterranean. The clearances in January : were 84,956 bagsfor the United States (against 49,166inJanuary, 1855), 12,633 for- the Channel, 17for England, 16,760 for Hamburg, 3,150 for Antwerp, 5,28 for.Havre, 2,275 for Copenhgen, 7,704 for Stockholm, 5,558 for Gothenbuig, 3,500 for Gibraltar, 1,271 for Marseiles, 3,200 for Trieste, 2,195 for Constantinople, 4,200 for Malta and. Constantinople, 245 for Syria, 266 for Portugal, 6,481 for the Cape of Good Hope; in all, 159,669 bags. The latest quotations are -for superior washed, 6$ to 6$800; superior, 6$600to 5$800; flrstgood, 5$400 to 5$500; first ordinary, 5$000 to 5$200; second good, 44600 to 4$800; second ordinary, 3$800 to4$000. The sales in sgar- were chiefly for home consumption, and comprised 1,290 cases 908 barrels, 2,300 bags campos at 3$600 to 3$400, and 150 cases 20,000 bags, from the north, at 3S800 t 4$400 for white, 2550 to 25700 for brown.

One of the really responsible shareholders is,a gentleman possessed of property in the county cf Tipperary valued at 3,0001 'a-year, and the number of shares held by him is only four, representing 2001., and there are others similarly circumstanced, upon whose shoulders wilIfall the full weight of the crash, consequent.upon, their aisp1ced confidence in the stability of a concern which, it is said, has for three years pastbeen-totsring.to its foundation. The lAeinfer Bxpress, . alludiiig to the connivance of M1r. James Sadleir at-thetremendous fraudsbrought to light 'in the Rolls' Court, aays,- It is, said that gentleman has already fled from the impending storm, but we trust that this is not the fact. Theshareholders owe it to thenselves and to the cause of public justice, that the surviving fabricator or fabricators of the swindling report sht,uld not ecape a criminal prosecution; and if Mr. James Sadleir and his coadijutors, whoever they may be, have not already gone,-it is right that measures should be taken to irevent their leaving tie country. The lastproceeding of Mr. James Sadleir has been a characteristic piece of audacity. A- man of the humblest rank is put forward as a stalkinghorse to secure to the chief living author of this wholesme robbery the winding-up of his own delinquency. As a matter of course, the thing would not be listened to. The next step to be taken is the appointment of a solicitor to have the carriage of the proceedings. It would be invidious and useless to offer any remarks on the respective qualifications of the candidates; but we must add a hope that the B-ank of Ireland will not be allowed to take the management of the case into its own bands. There are many strange stories afloat to which we do not care to allude, but this, everybody knows,-that to the last hour the Bank of Ireland was the patron and supporter of the Tipperary Bnk. It lent the w'hole weight of its consequence to a concern which has now involved so msany in irretrievable ruin, and there is no doubt that it was under its favour that the defunct establishment succeeded in gainig zhe immense amount of public confidence aftermrds so greatly abused." The Carlvow Posd, a political supporter of the late John Sadleir, tells this discouragng tae of the state of affairs in that locality:- - aveposits o large and smaller sums have, we hear. been made to an extent far beyond our previous calculation. Those of the latter class are cases of great, and many of them extreme, hardship. The savings of traders, clerks, and asstants, police-officers, and small farmers-the savings which were to establish some in business,-the small sums gradually accumulated for the future provison of large families, or as a support for declining years-all these have, in too many instances, been ingulfed in the mass of heavy deposits, and have left the deluded victims penniless, hopeless, and in the most afflicting despair. Add to these heartending features of this wholesale calamity thegradual development of a series of reckless forgeries on private persons. We have heard of three acceptances of considerable amount, and all forgeries, having been presented for payment during the present week at three different trading establshments inthe town, and it is utterly impossible to saywhere and how these audacious simulations may terminate. If for instance, the signatures of persons have been as closey imitated as is saigd the names affixed to certain deeds have been counterfeited, litigation atleast, andinconceivable injuy toprivate credit, must be the inevitable result. We are literally bewildered vith the number of distressng cases, with the details of which we are inmndated. Still, it is to be hoped that the liability of the shareholders, to the uttermost farthing of their property, for the deposits intrusted to these bankswill, in a great measure, if not wholly, liquidate the claims uponthem, though the ultimate settlement may be most inconveniently remote. But what renders all this more grievous and afficting is, that the heaviest loss will fall upon a country hich was only just beginn to raise its long depressed head fronn the ruin cansed fy famine, pesilence,and mveterate opnpresion. The very prosperity which has, comparatively speaking, attended the agicultural interest of ireland for the last year or two has been the indirect medium which induced and enabled the struggling farmer, especially, to la up a little store for other times. But it is ever thus with nations as with -individuals-those who can theleast afford tolose are the heaviest sufferers. Alas, then, for poor Ireland I" T; ErPOISONfG CASE AT NXWRY. At the a8sizes of Armagh yesterday James M'Caul and Samuel Townley Connor were indicted for the manslaughter of Captain Aqtila Kent, of the Iancashire Uilitia at Newry, on the 25th of February last. The two prisoners were youngmen, assaistants in the shop of M1r. Connor, an apothecary at Newry, and the charge against them was that, through carelessness or ignorance in maldng up a prescription of Sir Henry Marsh, they had, Tad of tincture of chirayita or chiretta. substituted the root of aconite, which the unfortunate gentleman 2lad taken, and shortly afterwards expired. 'The facts of the case have alreadyappeared in ThUTimies. The prisoners were found guilty, and- were sentenced to the mitigated punishment of four months' imnprisonment. TE FUIWDS. Three per Cent.
