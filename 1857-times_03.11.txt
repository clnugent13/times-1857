Journeymen Tailors' Benevolent Institution.
JouRNmExts TAILoRs' BExzvoL=T INsTrxTIoyN' -Yesterday evening the 19th anniversary festival of this charitable nstitution swas celebrated with mnuch ecilat at tho London Tavern, under the presidency of Sir J. V. Shelley, MLP. Upwards of 200 gentlemen sat down to an excellent dinner, served in the usual quiet and comfortable style ef the London Tavern. After the formal toasts the chairman gave the toast of the evening, warmly pressing its many claims upon the coDsideration of his audience. One important feature of the cbarity was that it was open to Journeymen tailors of all nations and of all creeds, and, though it thus practically acted upon the principle of religious liberty, a church was attached to the asylum for thoso whose creeds permitted them to attend, and none others were asked. Unfortunately, as in most benevolent institations of the same kind, there were far more candidates than vacanies, and on a late occasion no less than 62 applicants presente& themselves for three vacancies. It was to relieve such a presmre upon the resources of the charity that they were met that evening, and he most cordially pressed upon the benevolent notice of his hearers the claims of the Journeymen Tailors' Institution. The toast was warwlv responded to, and about 7001. was immediately subscribed.
e usual complimentary toasts followed, and were duly responded to. The musical arrangements wereunexception. able.

PARLIMENTARY INTELUGENCE.
HOU7SE OF LORDS, TuxsDAY, MARCH 10.
The Duke of ARGYLL presented petitions from various places in Scotland against the repeal of the Mackenzie Act, restricting the sale of intoxicating liquors.
MI-NUTES AND DIVISIONS OF THE ROUSE.
Earl STAINHOPE, in rising to call attention to the report of the Select Committee on the Minutes and Journals of the House, said that in the absence of any difference of opinion on the recommendations of the comniittee he need not detain their lordships at any length. Their lordahips were all agreed that the present mode of taking their divisions was extremely defective. The lists at present published contained constant errors and inaccuracies, of which freq uentcomplaintswerermade, butwhieh couidnotbe avoided ndaer the presentsystem. Some divisionswerenotrecordedat all. The other night a division took place upon the Bil for altering the law of divorce. Ten noble lords voted on one side and 2.i on the other. The names of many peers who voted on this division would have carried great weight, but the lords who acted as tellers did not happen to take the names, and it was therefore impossible to toll who voted. Great delay Eometimes took place in the publication of the division lists. On the first day of the session a division took place of great importance, but the names of the minority were not published until two or three days afterwards. The committee had agreed to recommend the adoption of the system whlch had been tried with such excellent effect in the House of Commons. It had been
,bjected that the system in question would take up more time than the present mode, but from the evidence given to the committee by an experienced and able officer of the Lower House it appeared that a positive saving of time wouldeccrue by adopting the House of Commons' mode of taking divisions. It would be desirable, however, to make all exception in the case of those peers who, from age and infirinity, could not walk into the lobby without pain and inconvenience, and such peers might be " told" in the House. Although the minutes of their lordships' House were inferior to those of the House of Commons in sone respects, they were in others superior. For examplo, they gave full information as to the progress of every Bill before their lordships, so that the amount of business that had been transacted and the number of Bills still in progress through their lordships' House could be seen at a glance. It vas proposed that to these partioulars should be added a notice of such Bills as had passed the.r lordships' House, and had reached the House of Commons with the fate of those Bills as soon as they were disposed of in that House. He trusted that their lordships' minutes and journals would, if the recommendations of the committee were adopted, become a faithful record of the manner in which their lordships discharged the dutyintrusted to them. The noble earl concluded by moving " that the resolutions of the committee be agreed to by the Eouse, and be made standing orders; and that the standing order No. 25, directing that upon divisions in this House the 'Contents' shall go below the bar and the I Not contents' stay within the House, be vacated."
The Earl of EGLINTOUN said that the committee did not specify wiether the gaHlery was to be cleared or not during divisions. If the strangers' gallery were not cleared no delay would take place between the cessation of the debate and the putting of the question by the Lord Chancellor, and no time would be given to peers who might be in the lobbies or elsewhere for entering the House. Perhaps it would be better to have a three minute glass, as in the House of Commons. He would also suggest that in the division lists the higher dignity of a peer should be given first, and that the title by which he sat should be put within brackets, which was a reversal of the recommendation of the committee.
Lord REDESDALE wished the words of the resolution to be so far altered as to preclude the inference that the space between the woolsack and the rails of the throne might be occupied by strangers, except when a division was about to take place, and the supposition that their lordships waived their right to clear the House at anytime they thought fit.
The LORD CHANCELLOR thought it would look absurd, in instances of small divisions, for one or two peers to walk round one lobby and ten or a dozen round another. They might obtain the advantage of an authentic list with. out adopting the House of Commons' system. He wished to know what was to regulate the putting of the question when he had not the gmde of the gallery being cleared. In cases where there was only one peer on one side, he did not see how two tellers could be appointed.
The Marquis of LANSDOWNE thought the Lord Chancellor ought to have power to appoint one teller if two did not offer.
Earl STA2NHOPE imagined that the resolutions, in their present form, would enable a division to be taken, even if no second peer offered as teller. Re thought that a trial might be made of the plan of permitting strangers to remaim in the gallery during divisions, and if It was not found to answer they could revert to the present arrange. ment.
Lord REDESDALE moved that during divisions, unlees the House should order to the contrary, strangers might be allowed to remain, except in the space below the bar and before the throne.
After some further conversation, various resolutions regu. lating the manner of proceeding during divisions were agreed tc.
COMMONS ENCLOSURE BILL, This Bill passed through committee.
THE IRISEI CHURCH MISSIONARY SOCIETY AND
THE JUSTICES OF fILKENNY.
Viscount DU'NGANNON, in moving for a copy of a memorial addressed by the Dublin Protestant Association to the Lord-Lieutenant of Irelandrelative to the adjudication of the justices of Kilkenny in a case of alleged assault committed on two persons in the employ of the association by a Roman Catholic, entered into a short statement of the circumstances under which the memorial in question was pre. sented. He said it appeared thatthe complainants in a case of assault tried before the justices of the peace for Kilkenny on Monday, the 19th of January last, were two lads named AMichael Cashen and Mathew Spellacy, who were omployed by the Irish Church Missions Society to distribute some of their handbills or notices 07 meeting, and the de. fendant was James Ryan, a Roman Catholic, in the service of Mr. Edmund Smithwiok, one of the justices who took part in the proceedings. It seemed that these two boys, or oele of them, tendered one of the handbills to James Ryan, the defendant, who entered into some conversation respecting its merits, and then proceeded, without any apparent reason, to assault not only the boy presenting the handbill, but also his companion. An information was subsequently laid against James Ryan. and he was brought before the justices of KIkenny on the 19th of January to answer the charge of assault. On that occasion MXr. Edmund Smith-wick, in whose employ Ryan was, came before the Court In order to give him a character, and that gentleman declared his belief that Ryan was utterly incapable of the act with which he was charged. That M1r. Smithwick should have taken that course could be found fault with by no one, for he had an undeniable right to take it. But it did appear to him (Lord Dungannon) most extraordinary and irregular that Mr. Smithwick should himself have taken part in the proceedings as one of the justices, and assisted in adjudicat. Ing upon the charge in question. Such a proceeding, he thought, to use no stronger term, was grossly nrregalar. But that was not the whole of the case. Mr. Thomas Hart, another of the magistrates present was, previously known to have declared that in any case where a Scripture reader or any ono connected with the Irish Church Missionary Society brought before him any charge of assault, he, for one, would not believe such person as a Witness, unless his state. xaent was corroborated y the testimony of others; and ldr. Smithwick further declared that he considered it a very great indignity on Roman Catholic subjects to direct them to protect Protestant Scripture readers against the attacks of a Roman Catholic mob. He (Lord Dungannon) was not going to enter into the question of the propriety of circulating tracts of the kind referred to among Roman Catholic subjects; but he must be permitted to say that where parties were engaged in a lawful vocation, provided they did nothing calculated directly or indirectly to disturb the public tranquillity, or to cause a breach of the peace, they were surely entitled to the protection of the executive authorities. They had unquestionably the right, which belonged to every British subject, of protection from assault. But from the communications which had been sent to him (Lord Dungannon) on the subject it seemed that a totally different course was adopted on the occasion to which he aliuded. The justices who were engaged in hearing the case had, on more occasions than one-if the information given to him were correct-allowed their party feelings and religious zeal to get the better of their judgment ; they went into court with their minds prejudiced, and he believed from all that' he had heard that tne case was disposed of entirely contrary to the evidence. There were three justices on the bench, two of them (as we understood) being Roman Catholics, and he believed the charge was dismissed by a majority of one. He (Lord Dungannon) contended it was imposible that the public mind could be satisfied that justice was duly administered when it was known that such a case as he had described had taken place. So gross and aggravated a ease was this considered to be in some quarters that the Dublin Protestant Association sent a memorial on the subject to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, stating the whole facts, and praying for an investigation into the proceedings. The answer returned to that memorial was certainly of a very unsatisfactory character. It merely stated that inquiry had been made, that the authorities at the Castle in Dublin were satisfied with the reply that had been received, and that they did not think it necessary to investigate the case any further. That the maintenance of an impartial administration of
justice was above al things neocessary in Ireland he strongly felt, both as a magistrate and as a landlord. He was convinced, however, that the answer sent to the Dublin Protestant Association would be looked upon by the Protestant public of Ireland with the greatest alarm and dissatisfaction, and that the fact of full inquiry not having been made into the circuistances] of this case would tend to increase party animosities, and bring the name of justice itself into con. tempt. He 'was wholly unconnected with the Dablin Protestant Association, or with the Irish Church Missions Society, but so strongly did he feel the importance of this
subject that he should reserve to himself the right, if necessary, of bringing this matter again before their lordships in another form during the next Parliamnent. The noble vir' count coEaluded by moving, in the terms of his notice, for a return of at pa of the memorial addresedu by the memaers of txe Du, Protestant Association to the Lord. Lieutenant of preland relative to the conduet of Edmund Smithiwic'k and Thomas iart, Egsq., justices of the

Earl GRANVILLE had not the slightest objection to tho production of the correspondence.
The motion was then agreed to.
Their lordships adjourned at half-past 6 o'clock.
House Of Commons, Tuesday, March 10.
HOUSE OF COMMONS, TUnsDAY, M.uRCa 10.
The Cornwall Railway Bill was read a third time and passed.
BELFAST IMPROVEMENT BILL.
On the motion that the Bill be read a second time,
Mr. SHAFTO ADAIR said, thatit had been brougiht into the House in violation of the understanding entered into between the corporation of Belfast and the relators in the recent Chancery proceedings against that body, and he there. fore moved as an amendment that it be read a second time that day six months.
Mr. DAVISON supported the Bil, because it would indemnify certain creditors of the corporation who had advanced sums to the amoant of 84,0001. for the laudable purpose of introducing gas into Belfast, but without a tittlo of sec urity.
Mr. FITZROY hoped thab the hon. gentleman woald withdraw his opposition, as he believed that the BiU ought to be referred to a select committee. The proceedings of the corpokation were no doubt irregular, if not illegal, but it would aot be just to permit an innocent class who had advanced the large sum of S4,000l. for the benefit of Belfast to bo altogether without remedy against the corporation. (HXear, hear.)
Mr. ADAIR withdrew his amendment, and the bil was read a second time without a division.
The order for the further proceeding with the Liverpool Docks Committee and Birkenhead Docks Bill was read and discharged.
PETITIONS.
Petitions were presented by Mr. SpooNxx, for the repeal of the Bill for the endowment of Maynooth College, from Ainess, in the county of Ross; Cahir, diocess of Li.more ; Free Church at Assynt; Kileheelan, diocess of Lismore; Hoy and Grzemsay, county of Orkney; Selkirk and the neighbouthood; parish of Dallas, county of Elgin; adherents of the Castle-street Territorial Mission, and others, Montrose; Free Church Congregation South Leith; students of divinity presently attending at the College, Edinburgh; United Presbyterian Congregation of Sonth Leith; Unmted Presbyterian Congregation in Leith, and others; Moderator and members of thse Kiirk Session of the parish of Ennethmont, county of Aberdeen;* and cotnties of Dorset and York; and by Mr. Riops, from Leicester, to the same effect.
Petitions were also presented by Sir X. FERGUSSON, from the inhabitants of Tarbolton, against the repeal of Forbes Mackenzie's Act; by Air. OnrvA, numerously signed by the inhabitants of Marylebone, in favour of a reduction of the duty upon wine, allegingthatthepresenthigh duty leads to adulteration and fraud upon the revenue and the consumer; by Mfr. PmITxuESroi, from the Corporation of Blackburn, in favour of the Meorsey Conservancy and Docks Bill; and by Sir J. Dux, from the coal trade of jtho metropolis, for the removal of all turnpikes and toUbhars to a raius of six miles from Charing-cross.
MAYNOOTH.
Mr. SPOONER gave notice that if he had a seat in the next Parliament he should take the earliest opportunity of moving the repeal of the grant to Maynooth. (Laughter.)
THE VICTORIA CROSS.
Captain L. VERNON asked the hon. gentleman the Under Secretary for War whether the list published of the names of the recipients of the Victoria Cross -was final, and vhether it contained all the Crimean recomnmendation, deemed worthy of decoration; and whether, in such c.
there would be any objection to publishing the names oL the officers and prnvates who have been recommended and rejected, with the details of tho services for which they were recommended?
Mr. F. PEEL replied that the list was final as regarded officers and men at home; but the names of those recom. mended for this distinction who were serving with regiments abroad had not yet been received. It did not contain the names of all those who had been recommended, because some of their eases did not come within the scope of the warrant, which the hon. and gallant member knew vas exceedingly strin ent in its previsions, and to the relaxation of wlich taere would be great objeotions. (Hear, hear.)
ARMY ESTIMATES.
MIr. F. PEEL gave'notice that he should move the Army Estimates in Committee of Supply on Thursday next.
RETIREMENT OF THE SPEAKER.
VOTE OF THANKS.
Lord PALMERSTON (whose rising was the signal for breathless silence) said,-Mr. Speaker,-It was my duty yesterday, Sir, to be the organ of the regrets of this Hoise at the communication which you felt it your daty to make to them, and also of their coneera that the next Parliament are not to have the benefit of your assistance in conducting their deliberations. I have to-day a task to perform of a nature more agreeable to me, and one which I am sure wil be more acceptable to the House. (Cheers.) I have to propose to this House to return, by their unauimous vote, their thanks to you, Sir, for your able and distinguished services in the chair during the long period oflnearly 18 years for which you have filled it. (General and sustained cheering.) Sir, that man must have been a very superficial observer of the proceedings of Parliament who has not remarked in how essential a degree the usefulness, the respectabilty, and the influence of this House must depend upon the manner in which the msn who occupies that chair shall perform the duties which he has to dischOarge. (Hear, hear.) In a great assembly like this, composed of so many persons coming from all parts of the country, it is obvious that unless the person who regalates their proceedings inspires among the members of the House that temper, forbearance, and equanimity which he himself possesses, this House might be led by the warmth of discus. sion and the agitation of public questions to depart from that order, moderation, and regularity which are so essential to maintain in the public mind that respect which is due to this branch of the Legislature. (Hear, hear.) Sir, It is needless, I am sure, to say in how eminent a degree you have performed your functions. (Cheers.) It is needless to remind those who have witnessed your proceedings how you have combined promptitude of decision, justness of judgment, and firmness of purpose with the most conciliatory manners (renewed cheers), and how that dignity, that natural dignity which belongs to you, and which is most striking where it is accompanied by simplicity of mind (hear, hear) and by the absence of all arificial affec. tation (hear, hear)-how that natural dignity whioh adorns yourself has been communicated through your direction to the general proceedings of the Commons' House of Parliament. (Cheers.) Sir, not only have you discharged in the most exemplary and useful manner your duties in that chair, but there are other duties, I will not say less important, but nearly as important, which the Speaker of this House has to perform out of the chair. I am sure that I shall meet with the concurrence of every gentleman who listens to me when I say that no member ever approached you for the purpose of obtaining information with respect to our proceedings, either public or private, which it was his wish to receive without experiencing from you not only the most courteous reception, not:only the most ready hearing, but also the most accurate information in regard to the subject upon which it was his desire and his duty to consult you. (Chers.) There is another matter, Sir, in which you have eminently conduced to the interests of this House. Our forms of proceeding are founded upon ancient usage. Many of them were, no doubt, the result of accident, or perhaps of design, at periods when those forms were more essential than at present to maintain thetprinciples on which our discussions should be based. You, Sir, have had the judgment to discriminate between the principles which ought ever to be upheld and the technical forms which might be varied and modified without detriment to the public (hear, hear), and by the suggestions which you have from time to time made you have contributed much to the despateh of business in this House, to the advantage of the country, and the conve. nience of the members of this body. (Cheers.) I am convinced, Sir, that in what I have been saying I have been only expressing the feelings which animate every gentleman who heas me; and ithat in moving the address which I propose to submit to the House I shall only be embodying the sentiments naturaUy arising in the minds of all who sit in this assmbly. (Renewed cheers.) The noble lord then concluded by moving:-
"That the thanks of this House be given to the Speaker for his eminent and distinguished services durin the period of nearly 18 ears for which he has filled tha chair of this House; that ne be assured that this House fully appreciates the zeal and ability with which he has discharged the duties of Speaker under circumstances requiring unprecedented labour and exertion ; and that this House entertains the strongest sense of the firmness and dignity with which he has maintained its privileges!Iof his unremitting attention
1o lbusmess, o the care whch he bas devoted to the imnprovem,ent of its forms, and of the urbanity and kindness
which have uniformly marked his conduct in the chair, and which have secured for him the esteemangrtudo every member of this House." adgaiueo (Loud and prolonged cheering.)
Mr. DISRAELI (who was received with cheers, and spoke in a tone of evident emotion) rose and said,-Sir, I have the honour to second the motion of the noble lord, and to express on behalf of the gentlemen who sit on the left of the chair their entire concurrence with the description which the noble lord has given of your high qualities, and in the estimate he has offered of the services which, unfortunately, we are soon to lose. (Cheers.) Sir, wO too can bear witness to the blended firmness and courtesy with which you have regulated our debates; and which have when necessary controled them, We, too, can bear witness to that learning which has guided and enlghtened our labours-to that high bearing which at all times and under all circumstances, even the most trying, has sustained the dignity of the exalted office which you have filled. (Cheers.) Sir, the. 18 years during~ which you have
occupied that chair have been a memorable period in the history of the Parliament of this country. Some of the greatest measures that have ever been proposed in the councils of tle nation have been carried during that period; and some of the greatest men who ever flourished within these walls have been under your guid. ance. (Cheers.) Sir, I make no doubt that in the page of history your Speakership, under those circumstances, will figure as no unimportant one in the Parliamentary annals of this country. (Hear, hear.) The severance of ties so long, so intimately, and so cordially maintained between you, Mr. Speaker, and this House cannot be witnessed without deep emotion. (Cheers.) I confess myself, Sir, utterly unequal to the language of panegyricI confess myself, Sir, at this moment unequal to offer you those compliments which you so weU deserve- ye't I can express to you for those who sit on this side of ths House, and I may perhaps presume to say for all preseat (cheers), but certainly for him, Sir, v6 hom you have often s0 condescendingly aided and guided by your counsel, the tribute of our affectionate respect (renewed cheers); the hope Sir, that when your name is mentioned in your absence in this House you will believe that it will always be quoted with regard and reverence (hear, hear); and our anxiou. and earnest wishes, that in the comparatire retiremeut which may await you you may enjoy that perfect satisfaction which you have so worthily earned. (Loud cheers.)
Lord J. IJUSSELL.-Although, Sir, it is quite unne^es. sary to add anything to the eloquent speeches in which my noble friend at the head of the Government and the right hon. gentleman opposite have expressed the sense entertained by the Houso of your merits during the long period you have filled that chair, yet for my own gratification it may, perhaps, be permitted to me (hear, hear), having been brought much into personal relation with you, to say that I cannot but feel that the manner in which you have conducted the business of the House has greatly facilitated the proper transaction of that business. (He-ar, hear.) I cannot forget that at tho period when you were elected you succeeded to one of the most distinguished members of this House-a man eminent for his learning, and who for many years had taken a prominent part in the debatei of this House, and who spoke, therefore, with the authority which accompanied that learning and that experience of the affairs of Parliament. BDa, Sir, although you might seem so far to have boen placed at a disadvantage, yet your merit so speedily attracted the respect and affection of this House (cheers)-I may say you so thoroughly won the heart of the House (cheers), that the exercise of your authority became comparatively easy, and every person was ready, whatever were his previous prepossessions, whatever his previous wish to persevere in some course of which you disapproved, to bow at once to a single word from you. (Cheers.) Sir, these qualties have not only been of the greatest advantage in conducting the ordinary business of the House, but you have beanl al 1 l these means to facilitate, in a great degree, tba; tra.i:. to more speedy forms, which was necessary fron' the
creasiug pressure of business in this Hlouse. l-:. Y,
have been able, Sir, to discriminate with nrcs'- and judg. ment where it was possible to depamt cnm ancient and accustomed forms, without surrendering an important and valuable privilege. (Hear, hear.) You have aecerately marked on's the iine where it was advantageous to concede, and where it was necessary to resis' innovation on our establshed forms. I believe there tQs nothing in oar old institutions more artfuUy contrived, nor more useful for carrying on the business and debates of a free assembly, than the modes of procedure and the regular orders of this House; but at the same time it is difficult strictly to keep up aU those orders without in some degree delaying business. Further changes may, perhaps, yet have to be made, and I can only hope that whoever may have the honour to succeed you in that chair may possess the same qualities, the same excellent judgment, the same power of wielding authority, and the same art of conciliating the goodwiU and affection of the Hoase, which you have always so conspicuously displayed. (Cheers.) I beg only farther to express my extreme regret, accompanied with that, I am sure, of every member of this House, that we have on this occasion to take our final leave of you, and that the succeeding Parliament will not have the advantage of your presence. (Cheers.)
The question was then put andicarried, nemine dissenIicatc amid loud cheers.
The SPEAKER then said,-During the long period in which, by God's blessing, I have been enabled to dischargethe duties of this chair, I have had abundant experience of the kindness, forbearance, and indulgence of the House, which they have shown to me under all circumstances and on aU occasions. (Cheers.) But I have not words at my command, nor can I sufficiently control my feelings so as adequately to express my gratitude for this crowning mark of their favour and approbation. I can only assure the House that I shaU cherish to the last moment of my existence the remem'irsnce of the proceedings of this day, and of the resolution to which this House has unanimously agreed-this great and inesti. mable reward for public service; and in all sincerity, and from the very bottom of my heart, I thank them for the distinguished honour they have conferred upon me. (Loud cheers.)
[IUpon Mr. Speaker addressing the House the members took off their hats. This mark of respect is usuaUy accorded only to Royalty, and on messages from the Sovereign.]
Lord PAL?ERSTON then said,-I am sure that the House would not be satisfied if we were to abstain from completely following the precedents which have been set us on occasions of a similar nature, (Cheers.) It has been the practice of this House,when it has been deprived of the services of Speakers who have long and ably filled that chair, not to content themselves simply with the expres3ion of their owvn thanks, but to give to the Crown an opportunity of going hand in hand with them in the acknowledgment of great and eminentservices, (Cheer) I shall, therefore, without further preface move
" That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty, praying Her Majesty that she wiU be most graciously pleased to confer some signal mark of her Royal favour NRon the Right Hon. Char es Shaw Lefevre, Speaker of this Rouse, for his great and eminent services performed to his country during the long and important period in which he has with such distingutshed ability and integrity presided in the Chair of this House; and toassure Her Miajesty that whatever e.xpense Her Majesty shall think proper to be
incurred upon that account this House will make good the|
Sir J. PFAINGTON.-Although, like the noble lord opposite, I feel that it is impossible to add anything to the eloquencewithwhich the last vote was moved and seconded, yet I hope that I shall be allowed the great gratification of seconding the motion just proposed. (Hear, hear.) I am one of those members-now, comparatively speaking, few in number-who have had the honour of a seat throughout the whole of the 18 years during which you have so honourably filUed that chair. Eighteen years ago, when you were elected, I Sat, as now, on this side of the House. I was not fortunato enough to be one of the majority by which you were elected, but I believe that I do but expres5 the universal feeling when I say that from the day of your election the members of the minority equaUy with the membersof the majority have been influenced by one unanimous feeling of gratitude for your kindness, of admiration for the manner inwhich you have fulfilled your public duties, and of that deep and sincere private friendship which I an sure must animate everyone who approaches you. (Cheers.) I therefore reciprocate with heartfelt earnestness the lan. guage of the noble lord. I regret that this House is here. after to lose the advantage which we have derived from your services, and I sincerely hope that your retirement may be as happy as it is well eamed. (Cheers.)
The motion was put and carried nemine dietienXc.
Lord PALMERSTON.-I beg now to move, Sir, that the thanks of the House be given to Mr. Speaker for what he has said this day, and that the same be entered in the journals of this House and printed with the votes.
This motion ws also agreed to.
THE LAND TRANSPORT CORPS,
Mr. T. DINCOMBE rose to call the attention of the House to the gdevances complained of in the petitions of the non-comminoned officers and drivers of the Land Transport Corps who served during the late war in the Crimea, and to move that such petitions be referred to a select committee. The hon. member obeerved that he was not surprised that complaints of injustice were made bv t'hb army, when he remembered tbat, instead of placing our military forces under the authority of a military man of knowledge and experience in his profession, they were controlled by a civilian who owed his appointment merely to political influence. He thought it would be just as reason. able to expect a tailor to make a chronometer as it was to plae a great army like that of this country under the superintendence of a civilian. The petitions to which he hadi referred stated that the Land Transort Corps was enlisted and sworn to serve for the term oT 10 years, but it was
provided that the men might claim their discharge at the expiration of five years, or at the ond of the war. The
petitioners stated, however, that they and their comrades i been most arbitrarily dismissed, without receiving legal parchment discharges, to which he malIntained every soldier was entitled upon quitting the service. He (Mr. Dancombel Was happy to say that he was spealding 'n the presence ot the gal."t General (Codring'ton) wao commanded in the $orimea, and who would be able to correct him if he made any inaccurate statements. The petitioners com ained that, in consequence of not having received the ra and legal discharges, they were unable to obtain respeotablo em ployment, and as they had appealed in vain for redress to he War Department they were compeUed to submit their
to that House They stated that on their scharge they only received the Queen's bounty of
20s, while the Foreign LUgion and the Turkish Contingent had been treated with great liberality; bat their principal claim was that they were entitled to parchmen' discharges, with a statement of character, and pay. ment up to the time of such discharges. In the first instance the petitionlers represetcd their grievanes to the War
wepartment, whs referred the applicatron tosi Colone t'eLado, the Director-General on tho pransport Codp in the Crimea. Colonel C'Murdo, on behalf of thebotree poartient, ent a mint extr ordinary rnd amussingreply, which he (Mr. Dancombe) would read to the Houss. Colonel M'Mrdo said:-
Cpaving had before me a letter, which has beSnl fori
warded to m9n for transmission to Lord Panmare, digned by certain non-commissioned officers, recently discharged from the Land Transport Corps, on the part of a body sbyling themselves the 'Central Committee,' I have given the threo points of complaint therein contained my best consideration:
"ic The terms of enlistment into the Land Tramnsport Corps were (as stated in the letter)-' Rations and clothing free.' If any man has been charged for his rations for a single day, let him inform me, and the error shall bd instantly rectified; bat no such Ctaim has reached me.
With regard to clothing, tho men have a clear title to compensation, and they shaUl have it; it has neverbeen domeed to them. Bnt wll any refleoting mran consider tho
ciromustanes unnder which this corps of 8,Os9 men were raised, organized, served in a wvor 3n,an miles from home, and were dicharged again-all withon 15 months, and tell me wvhether it was wthin human possibility to prevent certain claims accruing on account of a want of supply of uniforms to some and ayrears of p9a to others 5 It housd be recollected that toul htohe Land Transport Corps vas raised in Englano, it was organized nm the Crimea, I the midst of constant work in the presence of the enemy. The men were sent out 'in bulk, s the merchants say, with one set of accounts for all, and they were no sooner landedthan They were not only dispersed to battalions ofcepy ng-from Balaklava round by the camp of the 10th battalion to the 3d division, and from that again to wamara-abont 2S square miles, hat they were also sent away or detached to Xertch, Eapatoria, 5inopo, Baltchick, Satmsoon, upon trebizond, Scttari, and Imidu * ay, a partt Of the corps have actually traversed Asia Min'or from m3amon on the Black Sea to r eppo and p lexandretta on the Levant which no other portion of a Earopean army has done, I belIeve, sinoo th days of Xenophon and his 1O, 000 Greekrs. The first thing required was to get England's work done and the next to ro-arrange the accounts of the men thas of necessity dispersed. The non-commissioned offrcers and men of L ,and Transport Corps have done the former righ. well; and their offiicers, who have also had their share of thework, are aow assembled at Hlorneld closely employed upon the last most imortant duty, and I call ratten tion to theplacard I have pablished on the sratoct.
"2. With regard to the di charge certificates furnished to the non-commiasionod officers and men of this corps, I have been informed that the document directed to h
used on this occasion is termed a 'protecting certificatoe' and is a valid document, and I have given orders that any man who desires to have a character from his former offlcer may have ist recorded un the back of this certiafcate.
" 3. A claim for three months' geatuity has already been made to me, and I forirarded it for the consideration of the Secretuay for War, and I was informedin reply that Lord Panmzor 'has already had before him the question ef grantmig this indulgence to theLand Transport Artificers and he decided, and is stil of opinion, that no grouand exiseh t *r so dkmirg ; andu must say that I entirely concaz in his ioriadhies venws of the case, althoagh I did forward tho application in behalf of the corps. No people kter. -a better than Englishmen tho meaning and value of a fr e in; and I onlysdesire thosemen who have preferred
d claim to read over the terms of their enlistment, and, if t ^y there find any reference whatever to three months' gratutity on discharge, I will be content to forfeit my com mission and become Cha rman of the 'Central Committee' myself. den should not forget the parable of the Laboutrrs in the Vineyard; those who have agreed for a penwa have no right to seek more because others get it. The Turkish Contingent and the German Legion are irregular corps, and are dou btless made exceptionial cases of on that account. But the Land Transport Corps is a part of ller Mfajest,y's regular forces, and as su-ch has sto be dealt w-ith by the same rules and regulations as are applied to other soldiers of her
Notng has been done from that time to this. Geneoral M'Mulrdo said theses men had got a legal discharge; but w-hat was the docuLment they hadI received 2 It wa an old recruiting paper, with certain words scratched out and others introduced, and it bore that the person holding it had been discharged at a certain date. Nowv, what were the Quseen's orders and regulations respecting a di.scharge ? No officer ouaght to be able to plead ignorance on this point, for one of the orders of the service was that every officer shouald provide himself with a copy of the regulations, and make himself acquainted with tem, and before any offlcer embarked forforeign service he was to be required to produco his copy of those regulations. The rule of the service was that "no soldier could be discharged without a Court sitting on his case and seeing that justice was doneto him ;" and "everv soldier on being finally discharged was tobe furnished with a parchment certificate according to the prescribed form." (HIear.) These men had not received this ihargo and the consequence was that nobody would employ them. They had gone to the police, but were told they could not be taken upon the establishment, as they were liable to be called on for military service at any moment. The Chief Commiioner of the city police told them the document they had was only wastefpaer; and they received a similar answer when they applied for employment on the rawarys. (Hear, hear.) These men were walldng our streets with good characters and with medals on their breasts, some of them having claims against the Government of 141. and 151. a-head. (Hear, hear.1 In the Crimea their conduct had been worthy of all praise, as the hon. and gallant member for Greenwich (General Codrington) could testify. He asked the Government if they were not entitled to their legal discharge. (Hear, hear.) It was a disgrace to the country that the en ments entered into vwith these men had not been fulfilled; and if the House granted him a select committee he would p rove that every sentence in this petition was correct. The hon. gentleman then moved that the petition be referred to a select committee.
General CODRINGTON said there was no doubt that the formation of the Iand Transport Corps took place under circumstances of great difficulty. It was urgently required at the time, and reat numbers of men wero regularly enlisted in it inaEngad for 10 years. Many of those were good men and many of them were ignorant of their duty, and when taken to the Crimea had to be organlzed and disciplined. They were, however, regularly enlisted as soldiers for 10 years, and consequently were entitled to their parchment discharge. (Hear, hear.) If they had not got their discharge there was, he should say, an injustice done them, unless there was something about their accounts whichit took a long time to settle. At the same time there were things in General APHurdoPs sttement which he was justified in saying. The men were not entitled to any gratuity on being discharged, but having been employed in theCrimea thewer certainly entitled to their pay and their legal discharge when the war ceased and the reductions took place; and, not only that, he thought they had a fair claim to the consideration of the country. (Hear.)
Mr. PEBL said the motion ad speech of the hon. member for Finsbury illustrated the difficulty in which Government was often piaced in being called upon on the one hand to consult the feelings and expectations of men who had enlisted in a time of great emergenCY and who were afterwards disappointed because they hn ot realized all the hopes they entertained and all the advantages they expected from Joining the service, and on the other hand not to pass by those considerations of economy which, when the emergency was over, were pressed on the Government, but to relieve themselvss from those for whom they could no longer find employment. It was not true, as the hon. member had stated, that the Land Transport Corps had upon the average claims against the Government amounting to 14L or 15. per man. Very few indeed had any claims at all against the Government.
Mr. DUNCOMBE.-1 did not say one word about the average. What I said was that many men were walking the streets with claims Against the Government amounting in some esmes to 141. or 15W.
Mr. PEEL resmed.-What had been stated by the hon. and gallant member for Greenwich with regard to the difficulties under which the corps was raised was perfectly correct. The corps was raised at a time when every one attributed the miscarriages in the Crimea to the want of an organized transport for the army. It was determined, therefore, to raise a special corps for that purpose. The men were hurriedly engaged, perhaps without that strict. ness of scrutiny which would otherwise have been proper in regard to their fitness for the serviee, and as fast as they were raised they were sent to the Crimea. Upon the termination of the war they were brought home and reduced, as many other portions of the army were. He did not think that the hon. member, founding himself upon proceedin taken under such peculiar circumstances, was justiied in making a general attack upon the War Department, and especially upon that able offioer, Colonel 'Murdo, to whom the army in the Crimea was so-mauoh indebted for his exertions in brindng the Land Trnsport Corps into order. Whatever advice Colonel M1aurdo gave to the War Department was given by him with a sigle eye to the public service. Aain, the hon. member had stated that the men complained that they were harshly treated upon the termination of the war. It was undoubtedly true that their services wrere dispensed with as soon as the war terminated;* but the same was the case with regard to many other portions of the army. If the Government were to study economy they could not keep men in their pay when they were unable to find
employment for them, and that it was impossible to employ the Land Tzansport Corps in a time of peace was obvious from the fact that the corps which had succeeded the Land Transport wasnot one-eighth of its strength. The hon. member had also referred to the mode
in which the men were discharged, stating that they received protecting, instead of parchment certicates. The ordinary practice, when a soldier who had served for any length of time was discharged, was for a board of officers to inquire into and record his servioes, and thereupon to grant him a parchment certificate; but he contended twas p ly competent to the Seeztary of State to furnish a person who was discharged and particu larly when, as in the present case, his services had been of short duration, and a parchment certificate was not necessary for the receipt of a pension, a certificate of discharge in any form he ghttink proper. (An ironical cheer from Mr. Duncombe.) If what the hon. memberhad stated was true, that some of the men in consequence of being granted protecting certificates only had been unable to obtin employment, all he could say was that they ought to have applied to the authorities at the Horse Guards or to the War Depament to ascertain whetherthe quality of their certificates arose from any Imputation upon their characters. Had thet adopted that very obvious course he was sure that every difficulty would have been removed by astatemont from the authonties that protecting certificates were in all respects equivalent to ordinary pachment certifi. cates. What, however, was the fact? Me bad been informed by the Horse Guards that when an obbection to protectin.g certificates was stated to exist they offered to grant to every man who chose to make application a parchment certificate. Their offer was accepted in some instanceS, but in others parchment certificates were refused unless accompanied bY a continuation of payment from the time wheo the protecting certificates were granted to the period when parchment certificxtes were substitutes for them Of course, that demand could not be listened to;
but le repeated there was nio objection to themenzre-
wee0l'1 payments of Inoome-tax, bat he would find it difficult to answer a demand for the payment of the whole amount of a half-year's income-tax at once. Though Mr. Pitt's inoome-tax went down to incomes of 601., it neverthelees exhibited in its graduated percentage greater c n- fideration than the present propositon of the Government for the lower class of incomes. He trusted that the Chanrellor of the Exchequer would, from motives of humanity, "nciesce in the motion of the hon. member for Lambeth, ann it would be found that the nation would gsin by giving 1Ws,action to the working classes.
Mr. CH-IM concurred in the observations just made to the House as to the pressing nature of the tax on the work. Ing classes. Manufacturers had been caled on to give inTormation against their superior workmen. The hon. membsr here read a letter received from a member of a firm ia thc Staffordshire Potteries, in which the writer stated that the firm had been applied to for a return of all their workmen with incomes *mounting to 801. and upwards; that, after some remonstrance, the return was made, containiug the names of 30 persons all of whom were charged to the Income-tax, although not legally chargeable, and that they were put to the trouble and expense of appealing. The tax, he repeated, fell oppressively on the working man, and he wished the Government to state whether any steps would be taken to prevent the recurrence of such a proceeding as he had just narrated to the House 2
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER.-Tho observations of my hon. friend the member for Lambeth, that Vhi case of men with incomes below 1501. is not likely to meet with much sympathy from a class of persons whose Incomes are of a much larger amount, does not appear to me to have any foundation in fact. Although the members of Ibis House may not ba included in the class of persons pose messing small incomes, yet I am sure tley have sufficient mmpathy with that class (hear, hear), and sufficient appremtitin of the position of the working classes, to make the ease of a mechanic their own, and to take into their consdderation the difficulties to which a man earning smaaU Weekly wages is exposed by being made subject to the ineome-tax. (Hear, hear.) It is true that Sir Robert Peel, when he proposed this tax, did not carry it below incomes of 10?. a-year. That change was a subsequent introduct p, but the cases which the hon. gentleman has bsought forward are cases which did not arise when that change was made - they have arisen during the last two or three years, when the increased amount of the tax has pressed heavily upon persons of smaU incomes. When the tax was extended to incomes of between 1501. and 1001. it was only at the rate of 5d. in the 11., or 21. Is. 8d. per cent., but it has since been raised to 112d. in the pound, which is equivalent to 4l. 15s. lOd. per cent. Undoubtedly a half-yearly charge of nearly 21. Ss. is a heavy burden on a man who earns a weeldy salary of 2?. (hear, hear); but the hon. member for Lambeth entirely overlooks the fact that by this Bill that halfyearly charge will be reduced from 21. 8s. to about 11.-a sum which a man with 21. a-week may not nnreasonably be expected to be able to pay. It is not very easy to ascertain precisely the amount paid by this class of incomes, but as nearly as I can calculate the total amount of duty in question is 350,0001.-a much lrger sum than I feel justified in surrendering, especially wvhen itisborne in mind that by this BiU the charge on these incomes is so very much reduced. The hon. gentleman has mentioned the case of a labourer in the docks whose vwife kept a chandler's shop, and who was charged with the Income-tax. That case 'was carefully examined twice over by the commissioners, who are officers quite independent of the Government, and after going into the circumstances of his expenditure they were of opinion that his income was more than 100?. a-year. No doubt, it was a case of some hardship, and I believe that on reference to the Commissioners of the Inland Revenue they felt justified in granting him some relief. The hon. member for Southwark mentioned the case of a widow whose goods were seized for
rrears of income-tax owed by her husband, but from the manner in which he described that case it does not appear to have any particular reference to this class of incomes. The same thing might have happened to a widow whose husband had been possessed of an income over 150I. If the hon. gentleman, however, 'Will give me the name and the particulars of the case I will take care that it is properly investigated. (Hear, hear.) The hon. member told the committee that Mr. Pitt's income-tax bore less heavily upon small incomes than the present income-tax. I am quite ready to meet the hon. member on that ground, and if he can establish the fact that this income-tax is heavier ora persons of small incomes than Mr. Pitt's was I will consent to remodel it. Bat I find that under the income-tax of 1803, which was Mr. Pitt's second Income-tax, and Which contained aU his improvements, the rates were as follows :-On incomes of irom 6i0I.to l0t., 3d.in the pound; 701. to 801., 4d. in the pound; 801. to 901., 5d. in the pound; 9Q0. to 10QI., 6d. in the pound. Under that income-tax, therefore, there were four classes of small incomnes chargeable which are now exempt. On the classes of incomes above 1001. therateswerethese:-from 100?. tollO., 7d. in the pound; 1101. to 1201., Sd. in the pound; 1201. to 1301., 9d. in the pound; 1301. to 1401., lOd. in the pound; 1401. to 1o01., Ild. in the pound ; 1501. and upwards, Is., or 5 per cent. On all of these, except the last, the rate imposed by this Bill is only 5d. in tho pound, and in the last caseit is only 7d. I thilk, tlhrefore, that I have satisfactorily established that, as compared with Mr. Pitt's second income-tax, this income-tax presses with great indulgence on the smnalL incomes. (Hear, hear.) Looking to the exigencies of the public service, and considering that the great reductioll which I propose by this Bdl to make in the tax on this class of incomes will very much aUeviate the cases of hardship complained of, I trust the committee vill agree with me that itis inexpedientto assent to the proposition of the hon. member for 'am. beth.
Mr. WILLIAMS intimated that he should withdraw the onginal amendment, and propose in its place to leave out 1ll the 'words in the clause after the word " gains," and to substitute in their place these words, "he shall not be chargeable with any income-tax on any income of not less than 1,50?."1
The original amendment having been withdrawn, and the new one put from the chair,
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said he was glad the hon. gentleman had altered his amendment, for the effect of leaving out the proviso altogether would have been to make incomes of between 1001. and 1501. subject to the rate of 7d. in the pound. (Laughter.)
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUEgE, in rel to the question of the hon. member for North Staffordshire (Mr. Child), said he presumed the local commissioners had power to require the returns to which the hon. gentleman alluded. He (the Chancellor of the Exchequer) could not say 'whether such a practice was generally pursued, but he had no doubt it would be in cases where persons receiving salaries or wages amounting to 80?. a-year were supposed to derive income from other sources. A, person -who earned 801. a-year as wages might keep a shop yielding a profit of 401. or 501. a-year, and he would undoubtedly be liable to the income-tax. If the hon. gentleman would furnish him with the particulars of the case to which he referred, he (the Chancellor of the Exchequer) would take care that it 8hould bo investigated. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. WILlIINSON observed that this subject was beset v'ith great difficulties, for if they exempted recipients of 1501. a-year from the income-tax, persons whose income amounted to 1511. a-year might reasonably coraplain that they were subjected to its operation.
In reply to a question from lUr. PELLATT,
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER aid the justice of the farmers' schedule had frequently beeu discussed in that House and elsewhere. It was well known that farmers did not keep their accounts in so clear and complete a form as was adopted in mercantile establishments, and he thought, upon the whole, that the existing arrangements with regard to that class of taxpayers were not unreasonable.
MIr. PELLATT considered that the system of assessment adopted with regard to farmers afforded a premium to Ignorance (a laugh), and he did not see why farmers should not keep accounts as clearly as tradesmen.
Lord H. VANE said that the accounts of farmers inigh not generally be kept with the accuracy observed in commercial establishments, but he believed that the schedule which applied to them operated with great fairness.
The committee divided, when there were-
For the amendment ... ... ... 7 Against it ... . ... ... 33
Majority ... ... .. -46
Sir H. WILLOUGEHBY pointed out that the word " pro. perty" was omitted from the proviso of the first clause, so that only gains and profits were included therein. Hs e wished to imow what necessity there was for having 2,000,000?. in the present year for paying off the exchequer. bends.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER: was not aware that there was any reason for the difference in the phraeeology of the clause. It was thought that the words gains and profits were sufficient, aud would include " pro. pert-y." The item to which the hon. baronet had referred was not merelv the charge for the repayment of the principal of the debt, but was also the interest payable for the loans contracted during the war. The sum of 3061,0001 was the increased charge tbiq year upon the increased debt owing to the war. The exchequer-bonds were not chaed upon any particular fund, but came out of thegeneral taxation of the year. If the Hlouse would suPport the proposition of 7d. income-tax there would be no difficulty in meeting the vote, and, paying off this 2,000,0001.
Mr. BARROW agreed with the hon. baronet that the omission of the w ord " property" in the latter part of the clause would tend to raise a doubt as to the construction of the Act.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER to avoid uncertainty was willing to insert the word " property," but he believed it could only be done on the recommittal of the Bill.
The Bil then went through committee.
M6r. THORNELY wished to point out to the Chancellor of the Exchequer that great complaints were made of tie trouble given to parties who had occasion to appeal to the commissioners. (Hear, hear.) They had frequently to leave their homes very early in the morning, to travel some distance, and then to wait the greater part of the day for their tur before they could go before the commi'sioners
(Hear.) It would give great satisfaction if his right hon.
iend wvould give such instractions to the Board of Inland Revente as would obviate the inconvenience, expense, and waste of time now incurred.
Th 3 CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQlUER said he would communicate with the commissioners on the subject. (Hear, hear.)
The B -*as reported to the House.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCEBQUER then moved that the Bil be recommitted, with the view to the insertion of the word "p ropety" in the proviso of the first clause.
Mr. GLADTONE wished to know the cause of this change of usage. Why was the amendment made by the immediate recommittal of the Bil, rather than at a future stage.
The SPEARER said it frequently happened that an error In a clause wax not discovered uintil the use w agreed to, and the practie wa to amend the ror by the imme.
diate recommittal of theoBiU. Verbal altorations d bo made on the tbird reading, but the insertion of the word Iproperty" was more than a verbal alteration, anUd could not be made on the third roading.
The Bill was then recommitted, and, the word "ptoperty having been inserted, the House resumed.
SUPPLY.
REVISION OF EXPENDITURE. On the report of Supply being brought up,
Mr. GLADSTONtE rose to bring forw.ard his motion for a revision and reduction of the expenditure. He said,-In riing to discharge whatI feel to be a pressing dutyeI shall endeavourtopay aU the respect in my power to what I perceive to be the general impression of the House. I think the right hon. gentleman the First Lord of the Admiralty was guilty of an impradence last night) when he availed himself of his position to prevent me from addressing the House, and compelled me to p ostpone my observations till to-day, because it is perfectly well known that intended speeches of members in this House do not waste by keeping, like spirits in bond, but, on the contrary, rather have a tendency to grow and augment, till the time comes when they can be delivered. (A laugh.) I think, therefore, it is better to allow speeches to come out at the moment they are intended to be given rather than incur the risk of ruch augmentation and growth. (Hear, hear.) However, I will not trespass on the attention of the House at any lIngth. I will confine myself within those limits of observation that are compatible with the discharge of duty, and an earnest desire to respect the impressions as woU as the conclusions of the House, even where I differ from them, as I do in this instance, and that with the deopest regret, (Hear, hear.) In fact, nothing but the deep regret Ifoel, nothing but the conviction that we are entering on a mis. chievous course that before any long time has elapsed we shall regret the consequences of, could have induced me in this state of the House [the attendance was very thin] to make any remarks on a matter of such extent and importance as the expenditure of the country. (Hear, hear.) I intend to movo as a resolution- IThat, in order to secure to the country that relief from taxation which it jusly expects, it is necessary, in the judgment of this House, to revise and further reduce the expenditure of the State." I do not intend to re-open any of the discussions that have taken place on the more extensive and important propositons which I consider to have been either directly or by implication disposed of by the House in the course of former debates, and by which I conceive that the House has given significant indications to the country that it does not now consider it an object of public policy to take any mea sures with a real and substantial view to the cessation of the income-tax. (Hear.) The House by a positive vote declared on Friday nisht that it did not intend to adhere to the arrangement of 1855 with respect to taxation on tea and sugar; and if it is not bound to adhere to the arrangement with respect to those articles it is uncertain how far it may be called to travel. Again, with regard to the income-tax, it has treated it simply as a mode of providing for the ways and means of the year, and is not disDosed to weigh that question in connexion with prospective and further practical reforms in our tar 1ff and in our legislation. (Hear, hear.) The hon. baron et opposite (Sir H. Willoughby) alluded to an other subject on 'which likewise an important change has com e over the House-I al"ude to the 6,000,0001. of Exchequer-bonds which were levied in 1854. If the House 'were willing to enter into the discussion I should ask it to appropriate a specific portion of the income-tax for the purpose of redeeming the obligations we then incurred; but, as that in the meantime does not seem to be the wish of the House of Commons, I s,hall forbear to argue the question, and shall confine myself to the terms of the resolution which J have placed upon the paper. In doing so let mue state 'why I do not pass over this matter in silence. The position of the House at this mo. ment appears to me to be peculiar and unexampled. Great exception was taken in the early part of the sesdon, not by one, but many members sitting in every quarter of the House, to the amount of the estimates now on the table. (Hear, hear.) I need hardly remind those who hear me that the noble lordthenmember for the city of iondon expreesed in the strongest terms, and in very considerable detail-evenwhile he did not withdraw his general support from the budgethis objections to the amount of the estimates. I may truly say, therefore, that strong objections are entertained to the amount of the estimates now on the table, and I feel conw siderable confidence that, had the deliberations of theRouso not been affected by the prospect of a dissolution, it would have been disposed to entertain a motion that would have had the effect of affirming generally the principle of further reduction in the expe nditure, and, in fact, of remitting tho estimates to the Government for further examination with that view. (Hear, hear.) But now the position of the House is peculiar in th is respect: it sometimes happens, ss in 1841, that we pass votes on account, to enable Her Majesty to dissolve Parliament, with the view of taking the opinion of the country in repect to confidence in the Government; but then the estimates of which we sanctioned a portion were esti. mates to 'which the House in geueral was ready to assentThere was no general complaint against them, or any question raised as to how far they should or should not be reduced. At present there is that disposition; but we are in this predicament, that by the report now brought up to the table of the House we are about to commence affirming a vote of four months to estimates against which strong objections are entertained, and for no other reason than that these estimates are presented to us by a Government which has been visited with what has been justly called a vote of censure by the House. (Hear, hear.) The Govern. ment on that vote of censure appeals to the country; and the House, because the Government is under the vote of censure, is called on to pass, not for the year, but for four months, estimates to the general scale and formation of which objections are extensively entertained. (Hear, hear.) Now, the effect of my motion, as I understood it, would be in a legitimate and Parliamentary sense not to assert a mere abstract principle-not to interpose any obstacle to proceeding with votes in supply, but to do exactly that which it appears to me is the right thing to do -viz., to refer back these estimates to the Government for the purpose of reconsideration, or, if not formally and technically to refer them back, yet to express in practical and indubitable terms the opinion that it is the duty of Her Majesty's advisers, in the interval that is to elapse before they meet the new Parliament, to apply themselves to the reduction of the estimates, in order to a reduction of the public expenditure. (Hear, hear.) To making votes on account I have no objection. I have no objection to make a vote on account, and approve tacitly or by open sanction the estimates before us, either as relates to the scale or the form in 'which they have been made up. (Hear.) I ask the support of the House to this motion on two grounds. The first ground is that there does not appear to me to be any proposition by which an adequate provision is made for the necessities of the year. The second, and the most important, is that the expenditure of the country has not of late been kept under due control-that it has increased to a point 'which has become embarrassing, and 'which tbreatens to become, if due control is not applied, even alarming. (Hear, hear.) With respect to the deficiency it was shown in former debates that if we are to assume the present expenditure and the present productiveness of the taxes there would be in 1858-59 a deficiency of 5,500,0001., which deficiency three years later would probably be increased to 8,000,0001. or 9,000,0001 (Hear, hear.) Since those debates material changes have taken place in the proposals of the Government withErespect to the coming year, for the Chancellor of the Exchequer has made no proposal as matters now stand for the increase of the tea and sugar duties beyond 1857-58, or for any increase of tho income-tax beyond that year. We must, therefore, add to the deficiency which it 'was formerly shown would exist the deficiency that will result from this decrease. If the plan of the Chancellor of the Exchequer had been adopted it would have made an additional provision for 1853-59 from tea and sugar of 1,400,0001. ; and the income-tax for that year would have made a further provision of 2,000,000h. (Hear, hear.) There IS about 8,400,0001. to be added to the deficiency of permanent provision for the year 1858-59, and I am rather startled to see that, adding that sum to the deficiency of jbetween 6,000,0001. and 6,000,000Z. formerly ahl,n.= enth
data I hav'e suTppo-s-ed-, the-r-ew'-Willb~e a --` cuuncy O' en;
8, 000,0001. anv 9,000,0I01. Of course, I hae not taken into
account aly imurovement of the revenue from the general
rosperityoftbe country. I have assumed, also, that the hancellor of the Exchequer will fulfil the plan vith respeet to a sinkimg fund, although my right hon. friend opened to himself the other day a retreat by saying that the sinking fund might be postponed. Nor have I taken into consideration any reduction of expenditure. Butmy object in makng a statement showing the immense defidenc to be provided for in the year 1858-59 is to demonstratehov urgent and necessary it is that Parliament should begin to consider seriously the expenditure of the country, because otherwise you Will be driven to this alternative-either to make loans in time of peace or to impose a large amount of new taxes. That l the case with respect to the next year. But I am bound to say I think the provision is unsatisfactory for the year immediately before us. The surplus of 89,0o 1 hase bee reduced to 500,000., and againsxt that we have to take all the chauges which ain ais
oqt of the war in Persia and out of the war in China, except only 265,OO01, which is in. eluded in these estimates. I was glad to hearimy Aght hon. friend say he did not anticipate any charge on account of the Chinese 'war. Iam afraidthat is almost too good to be true. I shall be delighted to see bis prediction verified, butlI cannot disms m yM sceiaticism on the subject ; and if 'we have a charge for the Chinese 'war (as we know 'we must have for thie Persian 'war, over and above the trifling suam 'which appears in theae estimate), and our available surplus. stands at only 500,000. or 520,0001., I cannot consider it a satisfactory shta ft,Qneere n come and expenditure for the oomi vh b6nc bhetwefoen It appear to me to be distinctlyl th 9;of this House to mnake known the views 'which it may entertain in a ohap
which w,il amount to a, diretion to thLe Goveronment to Gon-_
Alder the EClo of the expenditure, and to effect a direct reductfoii in it before they submit e8timates to a now Parliknent. I feel the necessity of it for another teason. This Parliament has been. doing a nmot popular act in remitting what is wrongly called the "war ninepence." Itis done in haste, mnd not under the pressure of necessity. My apprehension is that thb Bill which we are now passing for reducing the incometax from 16d. to 7d. will have no practical efbect whatever on any payment which is made before the 1st of July; and, if that be so, it is pretty plain there was time for the new Parliament to operate on that subject. However, I do not enter on the question whether it would have been better to let that matter stand over or not. A popular act is done, I and perhaps it would have required some self-denial to leave j the grace of that remission to another Parliament. What I i wish to put is this:-If provision for the expenditure is
narrow and inadequate, and if the expenditure shows a dangerous tendency to growth, it is material that we should place on record our views on the subject. Although it is more popular to attack taxes than to attack expenditure, yet economy is the only true, real, permanent basis of any plan with respect to taxation which wil give satisfaction to the country. I ask the House to come to a resolution of this kind, ecause the deficiency in the revenue stares us in the face, and likewise because tho scale of our expenditure is too high. I wish to say a word with regard to one particularitem of revenue, and that is the saccession duty. We have been told during the present session that the succession duty is at present yielding a very small sumn of money. [The Chancellor of the Exchequer.-Half a million.] Not only is the full yield of the tax estimated much lower than it was two years ago by those who ought to be the best judges, but it appears that the period of arriving at the maximum yield of the tax is very seriously retarded, because, while the Succession Duty Act passed in 1853, it appears that we shall not arrive until 1863 at what is called the =oaxmum, produce of the tax-namely, 1,300 0001. I must express my regret that, considering the deacient yield of thi8 tax, Her Majesty's Government have not thought fit tointroduce the necessary supplement to it, announced from the first with almost universal assent-the succession duty on corporations. Why are we te go on from year to year levying the itam on individuals, and not lev
i'Cg a corresponding and equivalent tax oncroaos t t. may be saidl ought to have done that in 2 854 but the reason for not doing it was stated at the time. The Act had only come into operation a year. It was thought it might require early amendment, and it was thought betr to take the delayoraseseionfor the sake of presenting the subiect of alterations in a combined form. but that reasou does not apply'with equal force to the year 185B, or the
the year 1857 during which we have not had any intimation from Her tajesty's Govornment of their intention toextend the succession-tax to corporations. I am sorry, too, that no more energetic step3 have been taken to strengthen the department of the Board of Inland Rlevenue, which is conversant 'with this difficult question, becauso know from practical know ledge that department is gr2ievously in arrear. I venture to state that there is an enormous amount uncollected in the possession of individuals due to the public in respect of the succession and legacy duties, particularly the legacy duty, which is not collected, because the department is not strong enough to keep abreast of its work. If the succession duty is likel7to be less productive than was originally supposed, that is not a less, hut even a more urgent reason for applying all tho strength which can be made available to enable the department to perform its labours with promptitude and alacrity. I wish to say a few words as to the actual excess of the military and civil service estimates. The total expenditure of the country has increased since 1853 nearly 7,000,000. Striking off a considerable item which is due to the collection of revenuepart of which is productive, while part of it, I should hope, may be got rid of-there is above 6,000,000. net increase in the expenditure since 1853. Out of that amount a very smal portion is dne to charges of the 'war. I believe there is onlya anet increase of 750,001. in the charges of the funded and unfunded debt, taken together, since 1853; and therefore about 5,600,0001. of tne total increase is represented by sheer augmentation of expenditure independently of the war-neariy 5,500,0001. in the space of four years. My right hon. friend has said it is difficult to reduce estimates immediately after a war; but this is not immediately after a war. Eor 1- months, practically, we have beenawarethat thewarisatan end. Snpposing this to be the end of the financial year, for 12 months we have been absolutely at peace. For those 12 months the House has voted the amount of money asked with the same unquestionug liberality as if wo had been in a state of war; for this reason,-the House felt it was a year of transition, and the Government ought to have ample means to clear up the charges for the war. I wish I could believe that in the estimates of the present year a large amount ls due to the war. I confessl have heard nothing from any member of Her Majesty's Government which tends to make good that proposition. It may be trae there are some chargea, perhaps not inconsiderable, amounting to some hundreds of thousands of pounds, which are arrears and leavings of the war; but I am very doubtful wiether they are not more than counterbalanced by other permanont or increasing sources of outlay which are augmenting at an accelerating rate. On tho whole, I look at these estimates as peace estimates; I look at these establishments as peace establishments; and, looking at them as peace estimates and as peace establishments, though it is not my intention to challenge a division, I earnestly hope this Houso may be disposed to record its opinion that these estimates are susceptible of reduction. Now, as to the general amount of the estimates, I have a few words to say. Ido not wish to go into details, and when I speak of the military estimates I shall confine myself to a rough com1parison with the estimates of former yewrs. In 1841-42 the mi°itary estimaterFmicluding the whole de fensive estimates of the country, amounted to 14,700,0004 At that period they had been inicreased by several millions beyond the amount of 1835. In 1846, when very lage and exteniAve military preparations had been made on account of the menacing state of our relations with America, the estimates rose to 16,500,0004 InlS48theywere 17,600,0001., bot then they reached a point beyond the patient endurance of Parliament; and, as the noble lord the member for the city of London said the other night, the Houso gave .sch an undoubted indication of its determination not to entertain those estimates, that the Governmant withdrew them, reconsidered them, and referred them in their revised shape to a committee, the result of all which operations was that that they were reduced by an extent not far short of 3,000,00014 They began to incemase again, san in 1852 they stood at 16,012,0001. Iam inclinedatotake that year as the fairest
ear of comparison, because the charge for 1853 was affected y the cost of preparations for war. I therefore shall take the estimates of 1852 as a fair standard of comparison-of course, not upon every jpoint-I do not mean to discuss the cost of improvements in our establishments, in barracks, in the comforts of cur soldiers-I allow for all these things, but, on the other hand, when we come to look narrovwly into the matter, we shall find the cost of thesethings compensated with a real diminution in our military necessi
ties. In fact, now, under happier circumstances, under better arrangements, with a better state of the population with a better police, with Ireland more happy, and the people better employed, the colonies managed on a different systom, you have not the same demand for soldiers which you had in former times. A small but well paid and well treated army ought to answer yout purpose better than a larger army in formOr times, which was fiittered away by being emiployed upon duties not properly military, and which were not calculated to keep it in a high state of efficiency. Without entering upon those ,uestions, I shalultake the estimates of 1852 for comparison. 2heyworQ16,012,0001. The estima6tes now presented, inxcluding the estimate of cot of the Persian war of 265,0001., 'which, I imagine, is put down at too low a figure, and a small suma of 60,0001. for an increase of the Co~astguard, amount to 20,573,0001. Thus, in fact, upon the military estimates there is an increase of 4,500,0001 since 1852. Then, I take the civil estimates, with which, I must confess, I sm not disposed to deal more lightly than wit-h the military estimates, but rather, it apper to me, that we are -in more danger from the civll than froamn the miltary estimates. The latter come to us in great lumps, and as the amounts are so large we are compelled to look into them more or less, and if in any particular Year any great excess in those estimates is permitted the reaction and retribution are sure to come, and most likely will appear in the shape of undue, unwise and precipitate reductions. But that is not the case wtA the civil estimates. They come in 10,000 forms. They grow u o by small charges here, small charges there; a little increase of expenditure in this or that Government department; a few thousands additional voted under Acts of Parliament. They are brought forward in detail, and we do not see thena the totaL In my opinion, those estimates require to be rudely overhauled. I do not doubt that the Chancellor of the :Exchequer does his best to keep them down. Perhaps I mnay be allowe-d to observe here that I am very sorry if on the first night of the session I misled the House by assuming that the estimates were intended to be proposed upon a scale different to that which wag really intended by the Government. If I was misled it was by the statement of the War Minister, who had so distinctly announced what the military estimates were to be. I hope, however, my right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer will consider those who have pestered him ab ets-ra as his allies. I know his position is a difflicult one; but it is the duty of the House of Commons to strengthen his hands. (Hear.) It is the duty of the House of Commons, when discussing the estimates, to strengthen the hands of the Chancellor of the Exchequer against all the world; agaist those who are petitioning for fAvours : aesainst
ms own oolleagues; against this Hlouse itself; be=ause, although he may hope to brig the House to a
serious consideration of matters as a whole, yet when we come to the subject of charges inx detail it is difficult to control the House and prevent it from encouraging additions to the public xpenditure. I will just give one or two most impartial illustrations of that view. There was the immense charge which by a vote of this Honsc last year we incurred prospectively for the Ordnance survey. That was a charge 'which I think was inadequately consideredj1 have not the least doubt that the effect of that vote, uanless it be intercepAted, will be to entail a charge of 4,000,000L or 5,000,0004 upon the country. (Hear, hear.) That was a most serious matter which was decided in an hour or two, and I doubt wbhther a tenth part of those who voted knew the extent of the question with which they were dealing. Then I may mention another matter of expendituro, which I do the more earnestly as it is a popular description of expenditure-I mean the votes for education. (Hear.) I do not scruple to say that I view 'with reat
jealousy the repeated and constnt growth of these edcs.
ional votes. ( ear, hear.) I do not mean to ay that we have reahed the mnaximum of those grants, but I have come to the conclusion that a spirit of extravagance has °found its 'way into many depatents of the State (Hear, hear.) There is an idea ta" it is a popuarthing
to announce an inereas on the educational votes.
Her)And so,no doubt,it is. Some personsregardsucli icres as a good mneans of stopping the plans of the hon. mebe for te West Riding (M.

ef getting rid of any BUIS by iegitimate means, and although I hold it to be most desirable to assist the efforts of voluntary education, yet I think the administration of fends voted for that purpo3e ought to be regarded with as much strictness as the application of any other public money. I do not mean to say there has been any laxity of conduct, but it appears to me that a spirit has grown up which has led the officers of that parUcular department to require fresh means of expending the public money, as if the public money were somethin
of vwich it was necoessary to get rid of as mach as possible. That spirit, I think, has led to an unnecessary waste of the public money. I have been aware of that fact from the demands made by the officers of the Privy Council upon the local promoter3 of edacation for excenses of a kind which appear to be perfectly needless an , in some instances, ailmost mischievous, but all sweetened by the promise that if the promoters wl find one-half of the outlay the Privy Council wiU find the rest. Having mentioned that, r come to another matter, which illustrates another class of instauces ia which I think there haspbeenanundue tendencsys to extend the public expenditur, ad Ihop th Hose illnot consider it disrespectful to them when I say that those charges have been incurred nnder an Act of Parliament, and therefore i; is a matter which has received the sanction of this House-I refer to te At wichwu as ased creating the office of Vice-President of the Committee of Privy Council of Education. I regarded the passing of tEe Act with great regret at the time. mnow regard it with increased. regret. Objections were raised to the Bill when introduced here that it was a Bill to crate an office and grant a salary without defining any duties to be performed. The only anwer given to those
objections was that it would be more convenient to have a Vice-President of the Committee of Council upon Education in this House to tnswer questions than to have those questions answered by another Minister. Now, I do not think it is a satisfactory mode of dealing with the publio money that because three or four times in the course of a session questions s.ould be asked across the table respecting the subject of education, therefore you should create a State functionary expressly to answer those questions. (Hear.) Assuming, even, that it would be better that those questions should be answered by a Vice-President of the Committee of Education, still the work could not be better done by an officer of inferior rank than by a Cabinet Minister. The other day the right hon. member for Droitwich (Sir X. Pakinton) brought in his Bill about education. I anyone snubject more than another should have attracted the attentiou of the res,ponsible advisers of the Crown it is the subject of education; and if we had not been guilty of the extravagance of creating an officer with a salary of 2,0001. a-year and nothing to do, the Secretary for the Home Department -a Cabinet Minister-speaking with the authonty of the whole Cabinet, would have risen to give us the views of the Government upon this nost important subject. What actually took place ? A most irreproachable appointment was made to this office. I have not a word to say against the right hon. gentleman who fills the situation, but he is not a IJnister of the Crown; he delivers his own views on education as an individual, and cannot speak in the name of tho Cabinet. The result, therefore, of our having constituted that office is that, instead of hearin at first hand, from the most authentic source, the views ofatho Government on education, we have delivered, not the views of the Government, but rather the views of a gentleman wortiy, it is trae, of all resoect and regardfrom this House, yet stilla gentleman holdinga secondary and inferior position in the Governnent. So much for the business in this House, because it was alleged as the reason why this office should be created, bat it appears to me that we should have a little regard for the business out of the House. It is not wise, with regard to the right discharge of nublic business, or to the maintenance of this House in due respect among the people to constitute new offices which are entirely with ou itdtoe. How does the offiee of Vice-President of the Committee of Council on Education stand with reference to that matter? We asserted that there were no daties to perform out of this House. lam sorry to say that the statements made by myself, among other gentlemen, received an illustration in what was then taldng place, and what subsequently took place, more astounding than even I had expected. At the time that this House passed an Act to appoint a Vice-President of the Committee of Council on Education, in order to assist the Preident, the President was abroad. (Hear, hear.) He had been abroad for a considerable time. I think he went in the month of June last. He remained abroad in July, in August, in September. I think he came back in October, and all this time there was neither President nor Vice-President of the Committee of Councilon Education. Such is the state of that office; such the duties-most important, I admit, but stiU not requiring the attention of officers of that kind-that while the Government had in their hands by Act of Parliament the power of appointing a Vice-Presieent they did not exercise that power, although the President was abroad for four months, until the very eve of the meeting of Parliament. Of course, they will not suppose that I am finding fault with the non-exercise of the power. I am grateful to them for not putting the Act into operation until Parliament met; but I should have be sill more grateful if they had withheld it from operation altogether. (lear,hear.)I am not makingan attackupon the Government, but merely endeavouring to illustrate what appears to me to be a loose and inconsiderate method of performing that which I, for one, shallalwayshold to be the first and most essential among all the duties of Parliament-viz., the administration of public money. I illustrated it by showingthat we have constituted an officowithout duties, for thepurpose ostensibly of discharging some usually called Parhamentarv functions, butfunctions which, when they do ascend to a c aracter of gravity and dignity, are much better left in the hands of a Cabinet Minister than in those of any person occupying an inferior situation in the Government. Having spoken of the tendencies of the country and of the House of Commons in this respect, I do not feel that I shall fulfil my duty entirely unless I frankly state that I am not satisfied with the spirit of Her Majesty's Government in regard to economy in the public expienditure. (Hear, hear.) It doss not appear that the pubhc money Is administered by them with the fidelity and strictuess which ought to be observed. Without drawing a distinction between one Government or one set of men and another-without inquiring how far it is due to men and how far to the circumstances of the times-it seems to me that we have got quite different notions and rules with regard to the management of the public purse in small details from those which were formerly in vogua, and which had the sanction of all parties and all public men some 10, 15, or 20 years ago. Having stated that, I shall give an instance, because then the thing will be open to examination and no unfairness can be practised. The instance I take is one connected with appointments of the very highest class-I mean appointments tothe judicial bench. In the course of the last sesson of Parliament the House was pleased to throw a burden of about 160,0001. a-year upon the public purse in order to alleviate the expenses of suitors in county courts, and so far to provide for the administration of justire at the publc expense. I confess I thought that a very doubtful measure, and was not disposed without further consideration to give it my assent. Bet I venture to say, at any rate, that it the public are to be subjected to so great a charge, let us inquire whether it is or is not true that nearer home-viz., in Westminster Hall-the duties of the judges are falling below and within the strength of the staff appointed to disebarge them. I made the same observation at the time, and I believe I spoke in conformity with a strong public impression. There was a strong public impression that the duties of Westminster Hall were no longer such as to require the large and augmented number of 15 judges. I believe, also-although here I touch upon a sore subject, but public duty demands it-that similar remarks have been made with regard to some existing equity judgeships. Her Majesty's Government, by the mouth of the Eome Secretary, gave a pledge that the whole subject would be inquired into durlng the recess, and that a report would be presented upon the question whether or not the number of judges could be reduced. Very late in the recess a commision was issued for that purpose; but, in the meantime, two judgeships had faUen vacant, and instead of maldng any temporary provision for the discharge of essential duties pending the inquiries of the commissioners, Her Mfajesty's Government at once filled up those two judgeships. Life salaries, or sala~sies only terminating in pensions proportioned to the salaries-sums of 5,0001. or 6,000. a-year-were granted to the two gentlemen who were added to the number that adorn the judicial bench, while a commission was issued to inquire whether there were any duties which required to be performed. But that was not all. A third vacancy happened bythe deeply-lamenteddeathofBaronAlderson, and 1 am sorry to say that the same course was taken. I am bound, however, to state, in justice to the Government, that I think it was taken without the disapproval of this House. I remember putting a question myself to the Government upon the subject. The Government answered that the vacane would certainly be flUed up without waiting for the resuit of the inquiries of the commissioners, and imnediately gentlemen were found ready to laud and commend that determination of the Government. I do not mean to say, therefore, that the spirit of laxity respecting which I make my complaint is confinedto the Government. My belief is that it affects us all; and if I complain of the Government I do sony because I thinlk the executive Government ou to bel among the first and most effectual hecks forrestrainingthat spirit of laxity in regard to the administration of tho public money. (Hear, hear.) As I have mentioned. the name of Baron Alderson, and complained that the seat which he occupied. upon the bench shold have been fied np whUe
a o mnwas inquiring into tho dutieg of^the 163 judges, let me render a further trib,uo to the memory of that lamented man, because I hold in my hand a letter which Baron Alderson himself spontaneously Addressed to me in the autnum. Ho -was Abroad At the time, and seeing that I had made a proposal to the Governmeat, and the Government had nssented to it, that the question of a possible reduction in the number of the judges should be inquired into, with that high sprit of honour and public duty which animated him, he immed~iaey addressed to me a -letter containing his views upon the subject, and in that letter-I need quote only three lines-he says, " It is indisputable that 12 judges are suflicient for the term business." (Heiar, hear.) Such was the deliberate opinion expressed by Baron Alderson him-
Mr. MALINS.-He ays, " for the term businessn.
Mr. GLADSTOREI1 am no lawyer, but I know that the judges have something elso besides the ternm busines to do. Baron Alderson knew that, too, and in hi letter he enters fully upon the subject of the cL-cult business. 'He Is disposd to admit that there would be inconvenience in any considerable alteration of the circuits with a view to diminish the number of judges, and he states the remons in great detail; but ho comes to the conclusion that irovisinon might be 3made for discbarging the circuit business, and At the same time reducing the number of judges to 12. I need not say tlat the letter of Baron Alderson, Inwhich I entirely concur is at the service'of Her Majet7s Government or of 'any person who may, wish to Inquir into the subject. I think that what I have itated is not an unfair illustration of the mode ii which we are nowr going to work ulpon uwee'lo?is re-

Parliament, by coming to an abstract resolution that reduction in the expenditure is necessary, can .promote the object which it has in view. If we were about to go into a Committee of Supply the commitfee might be guided by such a resolution, and might proceed to reduce the estimates; but, inasmuch as this Parliament wil not vote the estimates in a final form, the new P1arliament might take altogether different viows upon the matter, and might decline to be bound by the resolutions of its predecessor. (Hear, hear.) I altogether approve, however, one portion of the resolution of my right hon. friend. Without saying how far it may be possible to reduce the estimates for the present year-which I believe will be found to be more difficult than is supposed, because they have been very c irefully examined with the view of making aU practicable reductions-I nevertheless think that it is most important at the termination of a great war, when certain agents of the Government may have acquired habits of lavish expenditure, ibat the House should at such a perlod carefully revise the whole of the public expenditure. (Hear.) Whether the result of thatrevision will be during the presentyear any material reductiou Iconfess Idoubt, because
do not believe that the estimates, in the form in which they are laid upon the table, are extravagant. I admit that they are high estimates, but I do not think that they are extravagant with reference to the present year. We have reduced the army and navy estimates in the prestnt year by 17,000,0001., and the House must remember that when we deal with millons in the way of reduction we have to experience great difficulties; so that I think, upon the whole, that when hon. members come to an examination of the details they wiU be satisfied that there has been orn the part of the Government a sincere and honest desire to bring down the war expenditure as speedily as possible to a legitimate peace footing. (Hear, hear.) I dont mean to say that the careful criticism of the House may not discover further sources of economy, but I say that there has been no want of an energetic attempt by the Government to bringthe estimates to a shape which sbal entitle them to the favourable consideration of the House during the present session. (Hear.) If the House wil examine the reduction of the expenditure which took place at the end of the last war, they wil find that it was not made in one year, but that it was the result of the efforts of successive years and of close Parliamentary investigation, carried on at different times. My right hon. friend adverted to some instances of extravagance at present existing. I do not wish to follow him in. detail through the examples which he adduced, but there is one to which he referred upon wbichl will say a few words. I Allude to the case of the Ordnance Survey of Scotland. (Hear, hear.) That subject was very much pressed upon me And other members of the Government bygentlemen, connected with Scotland, and it was ultimately referred to a select committee. That committee investigated the matter carefully, and they came to a resolution in favour of the survey of Scotland upon a very large scale. The matter was then debated in Committee of Supply, and the House, upon a division, came to the conclusion to support the report of the committee. I freely avow that my opinion did not agree with the report of the select committee. (Hear, hear.) I yielded my judgment, however, to others whom I thought to be better informed upon the matter than myself, and reluctantly I gave way to their recommendation. My individual opinion Is that all that the Government can be properly caUed upon to do in such a matter is to make an accurate survey of the country, fixin% all the principal points with mathematical accuracy and t us providing a geographical map which may be used for national purposes. I don't hold that the Government is called upon to produce a plan upon so gigantic a scale that the outline of a single county in Scotland would about cover the floor of Westminster Hall (cheers and a laueb)-a scale so laWye as to be utterly useless for all the oraiur
purposes of a map, and only applicable to the obiects of estate surveys. That was decided by the House how ever, but I still entertain the opiion that a map upon the scale of ono inch to the mile, accurately laid down is all that the Government ought to furnish for nationalpurposes. (Hear, hear.) There is another point with reference to the recent appointment of judges, upon which I will say a few words. That is not a, subject with which I am minutely intimate; but if my right hon. friend the Secretary for the Home Department were iu his place he would be able to give the fullest information with respect to it. The facts I believe to be these :-A commission was issued during the recess to inquire into the possibilty of diminishing the number of judges of the supsrior courts of common law; and the issuing of that comminssion at least evinces, I think, that the Government had not neglected the question, but that they were willing to entertain the idea of a reduction if it were practicable. Vacancies in the judicial bench have occurred since that commissionr was appointed, and my right hop. friend says that Lord Melbourne's Government,or Sir R. Peel's Government,would not have been guilty of such an act as filling up those vacancies while the commissionwas dtting. It must be remembered however, that judicial duties cannot remain unperformed, that they are of vast importance to the lives and property of the country, and that this cannot be regarded as a mere question of expenditure so long as the present division of circuits exist, so long as there is a demand for winter circuits, and while so much continues to be said of the importance of frequent gaol deliveries. (Hear, hear.) It is necessary, in the meantime, untl a reconstruction of the circuits cau be effected, or until it is shown that a smaller number of judges than at present exists can perform the duties required of them, that the judicial bench should consist of as many members as now. No tomporary arrangements could have been effected in the interval previous to the commission making their report; and it was for these reasons that the vacancies were filled up. I cannot doubt, then, when the matter shall be more closely examined, that it will be seea that the Government had no other Alternative open to them than the course which tbey have adopted. There is only one other point to which I will allude, and that is with reference to the increased charge for interest upon the funded and unfunded debt, occasioned by the war. I think that
y right hon. friend underrated the amount-the increased charge [for interest caused by the war being rather mnore than 1,400,0001. I believe that I have now gone through the prncipal subjects which were adverted h b my right hon. friend; and, although my right hon. friend will probably niot press his motion to a division, but will be satisfled with what I have stated, I believe that the discussion. which has taken place will be likely to be productive of -'o inconsiderable benefit hereafter. (Hlear, hear.)
Mr. GLYN confessed he was one of those who thought that by taking the Committee of WayAs and MEeans before the Committee of Supply the House had fallen into considerable error. With regard to the estimates themselves he conceived that it would be the duty of the next Parliament to take, not only the question of the estimates, but the whole question of the public expenditure seriously into their consideration. (Hear.) He believed much goodwould result by the appointment of a select committee for the examination of this expenditure. He was not sure that it would not be right, immediately on the assembling of the new Parliament, to appoint such a committee and tho estimates for 1gB89 ought not to be produced until that committee had reported. Then the House would probably have some certain data upon which to prosee and would be enabled to settlethe national expenditure much better than by trusting to the ordinary discussions which took place upon the estimates. (Her.) He confessed that he had listened with considerable surprise and apprehension to some remarks which bad been made as to the mode in which the probable expenditure of the country might be met. In the discussion which took place upon the tea duties he was astonished to find the hon. member for Wick (Mr. Laing) allude to an operation which appeared to him the very last which this House ought to sanction. The hon. gentleman said he objected to the increase of the duties upon tea and sugar, and he hoped the estimates might be reduced, but that if they were not reduced the House had at its command the means of fieeting any excess of expenditure by renewing tho obligations entered into during the war, alluding to those Doating securities, exchequer-bonds. Now, it appeared to htui (Mr. Glyn) that a postponement of that character waa one which the House of Commons ought never to entertain. (Hear, hoar.) It might be all very well for railway companies to have recourse to such subterfuges, but he hoped the House of Commons would never attend to advice of that description. At the end of the greatFrench war, when the country had to pay a greater taxation with smaller means of doing so than at present, and when therefore there was the more excuse for such a course, the Governrment resorted to many expedients to relieve the country from the immediate pressure of taxation-expedients from the effect of which we were suffering even at the present moment. Soon after the close of the French wari owing to what was called at that time "a n ignorant ihpatience of taxation," the Minister of the day had recourse o the expedient of raising that which was commonly known as the dead weight, the result being an annuity of 6oO0,000, to which the country was at this time liable. He trusted the next Parliament would benefit by this experience, and, if the estimates could not be reduced would meet the expenses of the country by a proper sysiem of taxation. (Hear.) There was another duty incumbent upon them. Both sides of the House should agree In deferring and in opposing motions for the reduction of particular burdens until the war taxes were fairly got rid of, and they were really in a position to dispense with a certain amount of revenue. (HIear.) If they pursued this plan, at the same time introducang as economical a System of expenditure as possible, the Chancelor of the Exchequer would moon be able to bring about those remissions of taxation which everyone adanltted to be so desirable. (H3ear.)
Mr. NEWDEGATE tustod that the rht hon. gentleman (Mr. Gladstone) would in anotherlArliament view attempts mado to enforce duo economy with more favour than when Chancellor of the Exchequer. At that time the
hon. member for Birmingham rmoved for the appointment of a committee on the subject of providing small arms for the use of the amy. In th
committee it was proved that the small arms factory at Enfild and the large expenditure to which -it gave rise were unnecessary, but the right hon. gtleman declared that, whatever might be the decision of the committee, the Government would continuo the expenditure. Such a statement he (Mr. Newdegato) had never heard; it was a virtual rejection of all practieal control on the part of the House of Commons over this department; and the result was that, though the Government factory had been built at an enornous expense, it provided not one single m iuket for the purposes of the war.

ceiving, parchment i- lieu of protecting certificates. The bon. nember had also stated that the men were dissatisfied because they were not granted a gratuity, and he had cited the Foieign Legion and Turkish Cntingent as instances in which,Xratuities were given. But the hon. member had overiooked the great difference which existed between these foreign levies and the Land Transport Corps. The latter body was part of the regular rrmy, and was governed by the samo regulations, whereas the Foreign Le-ion
ndTurkdsh Contingent were e'xcePtional corpq, ra-ised forssapecial service, and it was cormntent to the Crown to enter into a, special airangement wit them in regar,i to the advant2ges w inceh they might receive upon their reduction. If the Gorernment were to give grauities to theL
Transport Corps nupon their reduction, they ought in justice to gWant a gratuity to every man connected with the army who had been discharged. The case of the L3nd Transport Corps in respect to gratuities was realy the case of the army at large, and he entirely agreed with what the hon. and gallant member for Greeniwich had said upon this point. Tne hon. member for Finshbry had stated that he would press for the appointment of a committee unless it could bc shown that the claims of the men for certain compensation1 due to them, for clothing not issued, had becn satisfactorily adOusted. It was quite true, owing to the hurried manner in which the corps was raised, that the men were not furnished with clothing at the moment of their enlistment, and undoubtedly, according to the usual practice, they were entitled to compensation. A great number of such claims did exist; but he had been assured by Colonel 3r.&urdo that, with the oxception of a very few vases, which were daily being adjusted, the whole of these claimns had been settled. Although he thought that, consideriug the circumstances in which the House waes placed, it would be inexpedient to have a committee, yet he would offer no objection to the motion of the hon. member for Finsbury.
Sir J. TYRELL could understand the difficulties with which the Government had to deal in doing justico to all parties. The huts at Colchester formed a good example of those difficulties. Tho estimates for the huts in question amounted originally to 13 0001. orl14,0001. ; but in consequence of presturo from the peace-at-any-price p arty, and from other combinations which the House had recently witnessed, they had unfortunately been cut down to 2,0001. He trusted that after the next general election the Government would not find itself in the miserable position of being unable to do justice to the Land Transport Corps, or to provide adequately for the wants of the country.
Sir J. FERGUSSON was dissatisfied with the reply made by the Under Secretary for War to the speoch of tho hon. member for Finsbury. The Under Secretary for War had said that there were good reasons for having discharged the German Lepion on more favourable terms than those on which the Land Transport Corps had been disbanded. That no doubt, was true; bht were our own countrymen fairly treated when they were disbanded through no fault of theirs and left to starve on the streets, while we gave to the foreign soldiers whom we had enlisted free passages to the eolonies and allotments of land ? Not only had the men but also the officers in the Land Transport Corps been most unjustly dealt with. It was stated at the establishment of the corps that it would bo permanent. Many gentlemen who had already commissions in the army were induced to join it, but now, merely because they had served in it a few months less than the three years which gave a title to a pension, they were informed that they had no right to full half-pay.
MIr. DUNCOMBE also expressed dissatisfaction with the explanations of the Under Secretary for War. That hon. gentleman had Faid that the cases of hardship to which he bad referred were very few, but the truth was that there were hundreds of men In a state of absolute poverty, because they had been dismissed from the Land Transport Corps in violation of the army regulations. The mon -complained that they had not been treated with the same consideration as the members of the German Legion, who had received 221. per man, with the offer of a free passage to the Cape and an acre of land each when they arrived there. This foreign legion had not served in the Crimea at all, whereas the Land Transport Corps had performed good service there, and only 600 had returned to this country out of the first levy of 2,100 which was despatched to the Crimea. He thought that they had great reason to complain, and he trusted, therefore, that the Government would grant him the committee which ho sought for.
The motion was agreed to;
RA.CEEORSE DUTY.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER brought in a bill to amend the Act of last session for repealing and reimposing under new regulations the duty on racehorses. Tho object of the Bill was not to make any alteration in the duty itself, but merely in the mode of collection.
It was read a first time.
THE CINQUE PORTS.
Mr. WILSON brought in a bill to correct an error in the Cinque Ports Act, which was read a first time.
SLAVE TRADE.
On the motion of Sir C. B. PECrLL, a retum was ordered of Her Majesty's ships and vessels employed on the coast of Cuba and on the coast of Africa for the prevention of the slave trade, from the 1st of January, 1854, to the latest date, distinguishing steam from sailing vessels.
THE INCOAE-TAX.
On the motion that the Speak-er should leave the chair, in order that the House might go into committee on the Income-tax Bil,
Sir H. WILLOUGHBY suggested to the Chancellor of the Exchequer the introduction into this BiU of a clause which should exempt persons from liability to pay their ineome-tax twice over, in case of the default of the collector.
The CHACELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said that this was already provided for. In the Act of 1854 there was a clause which relieved from liability to re-assessment all parishes and places the collectors for which had been appointed by the commissioners of inland revenue, or had been approved by and had given security to the satisfaction of the said commussioners.
lnr. ALCOCK entirely approved of this clause, but thought it desirable that It should be compulsory,instead of, as at present, permissive.
After a few words from MIr. Wruz5es, who stated that three parishes in the borough which he represented had suffered serious loss owing to their not having required seocurity from their collectors,
The House went into committee on the bill.
On clause 1, providing that the rate of income-tax to be levied during the ensuing year shall be 7d. in the pound,
Sir F. KELLY said that his chief object in troubling the House with a few observations upon this clause was, not to obstruct the Government in raising the supplies really necessary for the public eervice, but to record his rotest
ist this the frst departure from the Act of
The right hon. gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer had on more than one oocasion asserted that the Act of 1853 was at an end, and that the tax with which they had now to deal was not that imposed by the Act of that year, but that which the people were now by law liable to pay. To that statement he could not subscribe, because, whatever was the arrangement made between Parliament and the countryL in 1853-whether there was a compact, or what in another place he should call a contract between the Government and the people, the condition beig the succession duty and the granting of the incometax or seven years-he maintained that the Act of that year was rot terminated, but only suspended by the war. (Hear, hear.) No one ever understood that in the event of a war the provisions of that Act were to be adhered to; but the first snfall and the subsequent large increase of the tax were accepted and agreed to by the country, in the belief that when peace was restored we were to return to the Act of 1853. The war was now hapVily at an end, and so was the year after the war for which it was intended that the war tax should be continued, and they now had to consider the amount of tax to be paid henceforward. There had been a contention between the right hon. gentlemen the present and the late Chanoellor of the ExLchequer as to whether fixing the income-tax at the rate of 7d. i the pound was, in fact, an increase or a reduction of the tax. his was really a mere questlon of words, a speciesof loomachybetweenthesetwogreatOxfordlogicians iuto which he wouldnot presume to enter; he wouldmerely suggest that the difference between these two right hon. gentlemen arose entirely from the fact that one spoke of the war taxef f16d., and the other of the peace tax of 5d. in the pound. (Hear, hear.) He (Sir F. Kelly) would not quote rom Haneard any of the decLarations made during the debate of 1853, but would merely observe that if without any statement from the Chancellor of the Exchequer as to the particular grounds on which they were called upn to increase this tax,and without anyestimate of the supphes required for the public service theywere upon trust and acting merely from their confidence in Her Majesty's Ministers to add 2d. in the pound, which meant the sum of 2,000,0001. sterling, to tho tax leviable under the Act of 1853, he saw no reason why upon any exigency, real or imaginary-existing, or alleged by the Esters of the Crown-Parliament might4 not hereafter be alUed upon to add to and to continue this tax- so that the Act of his right hon. friend the te ChanceUor of the Exchequer (Mr. Gladstono) might reaUy become a dead letter. He would not, at that period of the session enter into the many questions connected with the income-tax, but there was one subject to which he should briefly advert. sI.-the course of the year 1853 it bad been his misfortune to differ n;on many points from the right hon. gentleman who was
en Chance or of the Exchequer. and ho had three timnos
proposed amendments to remedy what the right hon. gentleman had himself admitted to be grlevances. These
amendments had been overruled, but, at the same time, upon the understanding that tho tax shonld expire in seven years from that date. The defects, however, which he had then pointed out, and the arguments which had been then employed by the right hon. gentleman the member for Oxford, afforded a strong reason for making a stand now in favour of the Act of 1853, and he should therefore move that ed. in the pound be substituted for 7d. as the rate to be levied in the ensaing year.
Mr. W. WMILLAS fully concurred in the proposal. The estimates so much exceeded those of the year beforo the war that he believed they could easily be reduced without impairing the efficiency of the army or navy to an extent which would enable the Government to take off the 2d. There were, it was trae, two wars upon hand, but the expenseof those wrswasnotincludedintho estimates, and unless the right hon. gentleman could tell the Houso that the excess od 4,000,X001 for the army and navy over the estimates for the year before the late war was necessary for carrying enthuse wars, he hoped that the committee would assent to the proposal of the hon. and learned gentleman.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXOCHEQERP-The hon. and learned gentleman is not only too distinguished a lawyer, but also his mind has been too wlcU trained in the study and practice of politics, to dispute the position that the existing income-tax, being levied uader the Act of 1855, is levied under a legal authority not less binding than the
Act of 1853. Nor doI think that hewilldisputo tho fact, that if thepresentlawremainsunchanged-thatis if no measure be passed for reducing the rateas established by the existing law, an income-tax of 16d. would be leviable, andwould be levied in tho ensuing year, I do not see that any advantage canl
be derived from continuing the disamsion as to whether lGd. Is higher or lowir than 7d. (a laugh), or whether tht Bill whieh I propose is or is not a reduction of the existing tax. I take tho Law as I find it, and, without going- intO the question of what the law ought to be, I proposea redue. tion in the rate of the income-tax whicl is now levilable by law. That being tho case, I think the legal grounds nrged by the bIon, and learned gentleman in support of his prow posal are entirely swept away. I now come to the moraj grounds. The hon. and learned gentleman says that, putting aside the question of legality, there wV a moral contract entered into in the year 1853 between Parliament and the nation, the consideration for that contract being that Government should impose certain duties on successions, and, in consideration of those additional burdens, that the income.tax, after being lessened according to a sottled scale, should cease within a fixed period. Now, I admit the stte of things upon which the Act of 1853 was founded, namely an uninterrupted continuance of peace. If that peace ha< continued and the Government had then come forward and propozed a large increase of income-tax tbo argument of thd bon. and learned gentlmian might be of great weight. He might have said that although you cannot bind Parliament by alegal obligation of such anaturo, stillyou bave incurrel a moral obligation, which you have broken. What has takea place, however, is wholly different. The very foundation of the settlement of 1S53 has been altered and subverted by thwar, which rendered it necessary not only to provide for its expenditure during the years which it lastea, which we dil partly by increasing the income-tax, first to I4d. and thea, to 16d., but also to make provision for debts contracted fo`i the purposes of the war payable in subsequent years. The hon. and learned gentleman asks me how I justify the ad. dition of 2d. to the 5d. at -which tho tax oaght to stand during the next year aecording to tho set. lement of 1853. Well, Sir, during the next year we have 2,000,0004 of bonds to meet which Vave been made payable in May next, to liquidate debts c0drad. ted for the purposes of the war, on the very ground that the. income-tax would take some time to collect. Then, agan, there is a sum of 250,0001. for the var sinking fund, so that. altogether 2,250,0O01. of war expenditure will have to be de. frayed during the next year. If, therefore, we view the case upon legal grounds, nothimg can bo more simple ; and, if we look to the moral ground, I think I have advanced a full justification for the course which is now pro. posed, and if I have there can be no reason why the committee should assent to the amendment of the hon. and learned gentleman. The hon. and learned gentle. man says that the Government have shown no reason beyond their own will and pleasure why the House should consent to their proposal; that they have not shown that any neod exists of so large a sum for the public service, Well, Sir, I can only say that on a recent occasion I trespassed at considerable length upon the attention of the House, and endeavoured to the best of my ability to showwhatwouldp,e the probable expenditure of the countrr; and also the means by which we proposed to meet it. The estimates for the army and navy have been laid upon the table, and, althdugh they have not been discussed in detail, still their details have been exhibited to the House. Then, again, the hon, member :for Lambeth says that the estimates are too large. Now, it is quite clear that I eaunot at the same time be amenable to the charge of the hong and learned gentleman of having kept the House in igno. rance and to that of the hon member for Lambeth. Well, Sir, the hon. member for Lambeth says, if you can show that you have two wars upon your hands, and that you require thil money to Carry them on, then you have made out a case. I confess, if that is the case which we are ealled upon to establish, that I am totally unable to meet the view of the hon. member. In the first place, with regard to the Persian war, a treaty of peace has been negotiated at Paris with the Persian plenipotentiary, as to whose full powers no doubt Can exist. It is well known to the House that no treaty is valid until the ratifications have been exchanged betweea the contracting Governments; but there is no reason to suppose that this, any more than any other treaty, will not be ratified in due course. At all events, the treaty has been signed, which is a great advance to make, and we are not entitled to anticipato that the war with Persia will con. tinue. (Hear, hear.) As to tho expense of that war, I estimated it at a certain sum in the statement which I gave. All that the Exchequer of this country will be called upon to contribute is one-half of the extraordinary expenses of the war. [An hon. Member.-" What is the amount ?'] Until we know what the total expense of the expedition mav be, of which the account cau only be pre. pared by the East India Company, I am unable to answer that question. But, whatever the amount maybe, the whole of the ordinary expenses will be paid by the East India Com. pany, and only one-half of the extraordinary expenses will fall on our Exchequer; therefore it is incorrect to say that the entire expenditure for the Persianwarhastebedef ayod from our Exchequer. With reference to the events that have occurred at Canton it is of course impossible for me, or anybody else, to speak with confidence. I can only say that, as far as Her Majesty's Government are at present in; formed, they see no cause to anticipate that the ordinary naval and military forces of the year will not bh sufficient to afford to British subjects at Hongkong and Canton the protection which will be required for their lives and pro. perty (hear, hear); and, as at present advisedt we do not look forward to the necessity of presenting aLn estumate of an increased charge for hostilities in that part of the world. At the same time, I cannot of course pledge myself that such a contingency ml ht not arise. There. fore, I cannot claim my hon. friend's vote on the ground of increased charges for either of the wars to which ne referred. The estimates are on the table; they are jns. tified by the difficulty of making immediate reductions after a great war, a difficulty which has been invariably felt at the close of previous wars, and which, if hon. members will look to the debates in 1816, they will find was distinctly pointed out by the Government of that day, and was to some extent recognized by this House. Other circuim. stances have also combined, as I have previously stated, to produce some additional charge for the army and navy
ivhen tho estimates come to be closely and jealously examined in Committee of Supply, which theyawllbe in the course of the summer, it will be found that they have been framed upon reasonablo principles; and therefore we are not to assume that any further ecunomy could enable us to dispense with another 2,000,0001. I trust, then, that the committee will see that the proposal of the hon. gentleman to reduce the income-tax to 6d. would derange the finances of the year, and either lead to a deficiency or prevent yoe
from discharging those war obligations which, under other ciroumstances,wouldbedischarged. Before I sit down Iwoeli merely call the attention of the committee to this fact,-that since the income-tax wasfirst imposed uponthe proposition of Sir R. Peel, in time of peace, it has never been lower than 7d. It was renewed at several periods, but it remained always at tho samo rate until 1853, when it was continued again for two years more at 7d., for another two years at 6ad, and for three years more at 5d. in the pound. Before the 6d. scale came into operation the tax was doubled in consequence of the war; and it never, in fact, fell below 7d. in the pound. The general sense aud rude appreciation of the country, entirely overlooking the niceties and refinements of the hon, and learned gentleman, asked from the Government nothing more than the surrender of what was called the "war ninepence"-that is to say, the differenoc between the 16d. rato, which the present Act fixeb for the ensuing year, and the 7d. rato which existed before the war. This general desire of the country is adequately met by the motion now upon the table, and r therefore trust the com. mitten will find no difficulty in acceding to the scale which we now propose.
The amendment having been negatived,
Mr. W. WILIJAMS said that the Bill consisted of only one clause, and he was desirous of striking out the proviso which imposed a tax of 5d. in the pound on all incomes be. tween 1501. and 1001. a-year. When this tax was originally proposed by Sir R. Peel that great statesman distinctly stated that 150Z. was the lowest point to which the impost should descend, otherwise it would inflict the most senous hardship upon a largo and deserving class of the community. At each successive renowal of the tax the exemption of iLncomes below 1501. was invariably continued until the year 1853, when incomes as small as 100!. were brought within the range of this impost, thus provoking loud and grievous complaint from those who were for the first time affected by it. The injustice of this provision lay in the fact that thoso subjected to it had to pay as large an amount of taxation on the nocessaries of life as was contributed by the richest classes Il the country. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, possesstig a very large income himself, could not appreciate the pressure of this tax upon a man with only 100. a-year. It deprived such a person of many of the comforts of life, and serious] interfered with the eda. cation of his children. The small shopkeeper, struaggling fo make both ends meet, the artisan, earning weekly in wages, with the aid of overtime, just 1001. a.year, and the hard. working and scantily paid clerk, striving to maintain a respectable appearance, were all entitled to the Chancellor of the Exchequer's compassion. Moreover, the mode irt
whnch the tax -was assessed was most oppressive to this class of persons. A striling illustration of this was furnished by the case of a poor man who kept a chandler's shop, the averago weekly return of which he sworo did not exceed 31 16s., yieldiyg a.profit of only I0s., and who, although his entiro earnings, vnth the addition of 10!. from precarious employment as a dock-labourer, were not more than 401. a. year,wasnovertheless chargedto thistax onan incomeef 100g4 This poor person went before the commissioners, and was put to great troublo before ho obtained redress. He had
been told of numerous cases of oppression by working men, and one of his constituents, whose income vas a little above 1001. a-year, but who, having a family in a state of great distress, was absolutely unable to save the amount necessary to pythe income-tax, was thrown into prison, where he remained about three weeks, and was then released through the haritable assistance of eome friends. Clerks and shop. keepers were obliged to keep up a respectable appearance, ana the deduction of 21. or 3c. from their small incomes for the pupose of paying the income-tax was a very serious matter to them; and he was onvined that the money now reqired by t Chancellorof the Exchequer might be sa*t by making a reduction in the expenditure. He concltied by moving the omission of the proviso to which he had re. ferred.
Mr. PELTLTT seconded the motion. 31any cases of hardship in eonnexionwith this tax on the lower class of incomes had fallen under his consideration. It certainly pressed very heavily on the description of persons alluded to by the hen. membei-, and he istanced the case of a poor widow .hose goods were seized for income-tax due from her deceased husband. Supposing the income-tax collector called upon a poor man for 21. at a time when, perhaps, he was out of work, howz ould he possibly be expected to pay the money? A poor working man might be able to make
minion was sitting, Flr Robert Peel, as the leader of the Opposition, would have risen in his place and moved an addre- to the-Crown on the zubject, and that address would have boen carred, not by the Opposition merely but by a majority oonsisting of members belonging to alf parties iu the House. In the same way, if the G(overnment of Sir Robert Peel bad ventured upon such an operation as creating three great officials with life salaries while a -commission, was inquiring into the question whether there were any duties to diseharge or not, Lord John Russell would have moved an adverse resolution, and an overwhelming majority in tho House of Commons vrould have sapported him. But I feel that I am insulting both the Government of Lord lfelbourne and that of Sir L Peel in supposing that they ever could have done such a thing, for I am satisfied that the temper, not only of tie Governments themselves, but of Parliament also, would have rendered it entirely impossible. (Hear, hear.) Having thus far illustrated my meaning by particular instances, I shall not further trouble the House, but shall only say, in addition, that in the miscellaneons estimates and other civil services there has been since 1853 an augmentation of no less than 1,700,0001. I knowithat we cannotnow getrid of some partof that augmentation, but it is something enormous with regard to the whole sum. Witbin the recolection of many who now hear me-at least within the reoollection of those who sat in Parliament 20 years wo-tho miscellaneous estimates amounted to only 2,0DO,00, per annum, and even then they had been greatly increased. Many necessary and beneficial additions have been made to them; but that is no reason why the same strictness of rule and method should not now be applied to the consideration of every question connected with them as used to be applied for almost the whole period which is within the memory of the existing generation. (Hear, hear.) I am convinced, whether it be owing to the war, vhich engendered a kind of extravagance in trifling snms, or to some other cause, that a very great change, an unhavpy and mischiovous change, has come over the spirit of Parliament; and the time will come-nay, has come-when it is necessary to make soma vigorous effort to return to the wholesome rules and maxims which used to prevail some 10 or 15 years ago. Of one thing at least I feel quite certain-that yon wil not go on, peace continuing, for 12 months longer without some strong movement in this direction. (Hear, hear.) I defy you to meet the finances of this year without opening up the whole subject of your expenditure, and what now proposo is that we should express our desire before we go to the country, that Her Majesty's Government should, during the interval of comparative loisure and repose which they wim enjoy, employ some portion of it in a careful consideration of the estimates, wiich appear to me beyond what the necessities of the country require. I do believe, if the Parliament had continued, that that would have been found to be the gonuine and deliberate feeling of the House. At present I only a ppeal to the Government and those who hear me to give this subject its due consideration, and with no intention of chaUenginr a divson. I confess I believe it is one of those subjects which are always handled better when handled early and with respect to which, if we do what we can by a judicious and well-considerod measure, we shall be the more likely to give greater satisfation lo the country, and run much less risk of cOnming to a precipitate conclusion than if we delayed dealing with them to tho very last moment, under the pressare of public impatience, when the time for judicious retrenchment has passed away. (EHear, hear.) I beg leave Sir to move this resolution,-stating, at the same time, tEat f do not wish to interfere with votes of credit in the Committce of Sapplyl-
"Ihat in order to secure to the country that relief from taxation which it justly expects, itis necessary, in the judgicent of this House, to revlIe and farther reduce the exponditure of the State!'
Mr. W. WILLIAMS seconded the resolution, remarking that the right hon. gentleman (Mr. Gladstone) had made out so clear and urgent a case of necessity for revising the extravagant expenditure of the country for the ensuing year that he could not by any observations of his own hope to strengthen it. He would only remark, reference having been made to the sabject of the legacy duty, that he (bIr. WiUiams) had on several occasions called the attention of the House to that question, and had urged them to impose some sach duty on real property as had been imposed on personal proper for the last 60 years, and by which he had no doabt a sum of from 1,500,0001. to 2,000,0001. would be added annuaUy to the revenue of the 'Sountry.
The question having been put,
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUBR said,-Mr. Speaker,-In the wide-ranging survey of the present state of the finances, both of revenuo and expenditure, ilustrated by his official experience and his extensive knowledge of public affairs, which my right hon. friend (Mr. Gladstone) has just taken, there is much in which I concur; and, with regard to that part of his address to which I cannot altogether assent, I quite admit that the subjects which he has brought under the attention of the House are fuly deserving of its serious consideration. (Cheers.) I conceive that the principal object of my right hon. friend has been to a great extent satisfied by tho statement which ho has madethat he would wish to bring his views on these important matters under the consideration of the House and the country-and that he will not think that I am treating him or the House with any disrespect if I do not follow him Item by item through his statement. (Hear, hear.) But I think it my dauty to advert to some of the subjects which he has brought under ourconsLderation. Now, I will divide what I have to say briefly under the two heads of taxation and expenditure. With regard to the question of taxation, as involving an apprehension of a deficiency in future years, I will say at once-p utting all years after the present out of the question, and confining the plan I submit to the House to the present year, on account of the position of the Government and the House-it would be mere waste of time if I were to go into an investigation of the probable balance of revenue and expenditure in any year after that which commences after the 1st of April next. (Hear, hear.) It will be the duty of any Government which may be at the head of public affairs in future years to propose to the House means for meeting the expenditure of the country out of the taxation of the year, and not to resort to the method of borrowing in order to defray the carrent expenditare in a time of peacc. (Hear, hear.) How that is to be effected-whether by a reduction of expenditure or by the impo sition of new taxes-it is not now my wish to express any opinion; but I do maintain, in the most confident manner, that in a time of peace it is not a legitimate source of revenue to recur to the credit of the country with the view to increase its financial resources. (Hear, hear.) I have now only to deal with the taxation Of the present year. Let me observe that this is the first year since 1853 in which it has not been the duty of the Finance Minister to exhibit a great difference of revenue as com. pared with expenditure, and to appeal to the House to have recourse to different means of borrowing on the national credit. This is the first yeai since 1853 in which] it has' been possible to show a surplus derived exclusively from the ordinary resources of taxation. My right hon. friend says my surplus is not a sufficient one, and that he fears, under the augmented ex. penses of the year, it wilbe found that it is not adequate to bear those charges. I can only say, judging from my present lights, and looldng forward to the probable revenne and expenditure of the year, that I apprehend no such alarm. (Hear, hear.) At the same time, it is impossible to be prepared against all contingencies; but I anticipate, as far as my present information and means of judging of the future go, no difficulty with regard to the ensuing year. As to the alterations in taxation which I have felt it my duty to proposo, if it had not happened that the income-tax was fixed for another year at the high rate it was during the war, and if the Government had not felt that that rate was greater than was demanded by the probable expenditure f the year, and that probably much disatisfaction would be created if they postponed the settlement of the question, undoubtedly they would have abstained from making the provision they have done. But, believing that a large sum was not wanted for the service of the year, and seeing what a natural amount of anxietyprevailed inthe countrylest the income-tax should continue at 16d. for another year, they felt ittheirdutyin this Parliament to propose the measure which has gone through committee this evening. I cannot but think that the discretion they have exercised is a sound one, and that in the exercise of that discretion they will be confirmed by the deliberate judgment of the House and the country. (Cheers.
With regard to the duties on tea and sagar, unlessit had been deemed desirable that they should descend to the rates fixed by the previously existing law from the 1st of Aprl next, it would not have been competent for the new Parlia-
ment to deal with those questions when they met, as the time would then havo passed for their doing so, and therefore wo felt it our duty to make the proposals
which wo did with regard to those two taxes. Those wero the reasons which influenced us in our proposals upon the subject of taxation, and I cannot think that the House wil regard them as insufficient. (Hear, hear.) I now come to the subject of expenditure and of the estimates which have been laid upon tho table. fy right hon. friend says that theHouse expressed a " tacit " approbation of the scale on which those estimates were framed ; but I don't understand that the House has expressed any ayprobation, tacit or avowed, upon the subject ; and I wish it to be distinctly understood, so faras the Government are concerned, that they do not consider that tho House is in any degree pledgedto the amount of those estimates. (Hear, bear.) I don't understand that the House has given any approbation to them; but I hold that whenever we shall reassemble it
will he competont for the new ParliAment to examine tho estimate6 as if they were then proposed for the first tlme, I believe that the course wiU bo torevote the estimates for tho whole amount, and any modification which may be then deemed desirable cari at that time be made. At all events, when we propose a vote on account, I do not see how any member who agrees to such supply can be said to give i2s approbation to the total amount. All that be saysis "I
trust the Government with a sum which I believe ;Il be sufficient to carr on the public servioo until the new Parlia. mont assembles. It is utterly impossible that any other course ould be adopted; the publio servioe must be carried
on duringethe2interval betwen th dissolution and there-
assembling of Parliamenst, anadif anyIbuble cours ca be augeated othier thans that thaieh weo have adopted I shll be
tbeexpendltue of the State. "Now, I doni*s hour tbis
the work of the next Parlnmen. (Hear.) It is indeed almost arrogant for any of us to suppose that we ha be members of the next House. I may have opinions as regard mny own chancee of dlection, and other gentlemen may entertaii opinions asto theirs, but I don't think, Sir, we ought to intrude those views upon your observation, and give notice, as some very eminent members have done as to what they intend to do in the next Parliament. ("Hear," and a laugh.) I think that nothing could be more dangerons than the xggeestion of the hon. member for Kendal, that the new Mousa of Commons, which wili raset, I trust, full of vigour and renovated from the embraces of the people (a laugh), should. commence its career by first of all proposing a plan to re lieve the Government from the discharge of their duties. (Eear, hear.) In extraordinary cases, when Ministers have not been able to perform their duties, the House has consented to the appointment of finance committees; but vould it he safe to adopt the rule that the Governmnent is to be superseded in its executive functions by a committee of this House (hear, hear), and that this House should perform those duties which ought to he performed in townddgstreet ? If we were to adopt such a principle we should have to consider whether our administrative organiization is not on too great a scale; and I confess I hold precirely the contrary opinion, and we should place the Executive in a position which it was never intended to occupy. We might have on the Mtinisteria bench representatives of the poor, ignorant, and indolent creatures who in France, under the Merovingian dynasty, held high offices of State; and we, perhaps might see a Secretary of State, a ChanceUor of tne Exchequer, or a First Lord of the Admiralty who had nothing to do with the department of which he was the head. I have only risen to protest against the principle of committees of the House of Com2nons being called upon to prepare estimates which it is the duty of the Government to prepare. I trust that in the interval which will elapse before the meeting of the new Parliament all those influences will be exerted which make mnen wiser, better, and perhaps sadder (a laugh), and I hope thatthe result will be that the next House of Commons wll have laid before them estimates lower than those which have been submitted to us. (Hear, hear.) But, whatever the eshmates may be, let them come from the Government hear, hear), and by the manner in which they are prepared znd defended let er aesty's Ministers show whether or not they are entitled to te confidence of Parliament. The principle that the new House of Commons, with all its crudeness and want of experience, should be called upon to discharge functions which properly belong to the Executive is one which, in these our last day, we ought not to sanction. We ought, on the contrary, to hope that the new Parliament vill hold the Government well to the performance of their cluties. That is what we want. (Hear, hear.) We want a Government which shall possess the confidence of the House of Commous, and which will not shrink from the performance of its duties, and not one which is content to carry on from hand to mouth, and which whenever a difficulty occurs is willing to be superseded by a committee of this House. (Hear, hear.) If a Government perform their duty in an efficient manner that Government cannot fail to meet with confidence from the House, but I must protest against Parliament, whose part it is to act the critic upon the schemes of the Government, being called upon to act S the mnventors and authors of their plans. (Cheers.)
After a few words from Sir HL WILLOUGHBY, the report was agreed to.
EXTRAPAROCHITA PLACES BILL.'
The House then went Into committee on this Bil. On clauso 1,
Sir G. B. PECHIEL objected to the construction of the Poor Law Board, to which extra powers would bogiven by the 231L The conduct of Mir. Baines while at the head of the Poor Law Board was very concilatory, but that of the right hon. gentleman who had succeeded him was exactly the reverse, for he hadhad disputes with almost every Poor Larw Union in the country. unsuccessful attempt had been made by the Poor Law Board to compel the guardians of the Lancashire Union to consent to the erection of a work,house involving an e.xnditure of 40,000., and an equaUy unsuccessful effort had been made to force the guardians of the Exeter Union to fiUl up unnecessarily a vacancy in the zumber of their inspectors. Ee might refer to similar attempts on the part of the right hon. gentleman in Carzarvonshire and other pl ; and if he and the right hon. gentleman should be returned at the next general r lection he should require the right hon. gentleman to give a satisfactory explanation of his conduct.
Mr. BARROW said that, as it was not proposed that this Bill should come into operation until the 31st of Decomber, there was no occasion to proceed with it in that state of the House. There were only between 20 and 30 members present, and he hoped it would be postponed.
Mr. BOUVERIE accounted for the small number of uembers present by saying that all the gentlemen who were materially interested in this question had given their assent to the provisions of the Bill. He denied that the Poor Law B3oard was, as had been asserted by the glat admliral (Admiral Pechell), in a chronic state of hostywty ithhoards of guardians, and asserted that, on the contrary, with most boards of guardians itvworked with the moet cordial cooperation and in the obst possible spirit.
Mr. MALINS reniinded the committeo that he had on ihe previous day presented a petition against this Bill from a person interesied in this question, and pressed the right hon. gentleman net to proceed with the measure, unless he vas quite certain that the absence of members did not arise from a belief, which he (Mr. 3falins) had himself entertained, that it was to be postponed until the meeting of the
Sir H. WILLOUGHBY trusted that the noble lord -wouldl not allow the Bill to be proceeded with at preent.
After some further conversation,
Lord PALMERSTON expressedfa hope that the Bill .would bo allowed,to proceed. twassverylimited initsrange, and designed to remedy an acknowledged evil, and It had received the assent of most persons conversant with the matters to which it related. In the present state of public afilirs measures of importance exciing great difference of opinion ought not to be undertaken. but that was no zeason why Parliament should absolutefy abdicate its functions. If there were any objections to the details of this Bill they could bo discussed upon the report.
Mr. BARROW had understood that the measure was to be abandoned for the present. Its provisions required to be considerably modified.
Mr. BOUVERIE said it was a disgrace to Parliament to leave thegrievance with which the Bill dealt any longer undressdr-
Mr. MAIMS would not offer any further opposition at that stage.
The clauses of the Bill were then considered,
Sir G. PECHELL moved the rejection of the 8th clause.
Mr. STAFFORD said he understood that the Bil was favourably received in the country, and he thought the time had arrived when the Poor Law Department should consider whether it would not be advisable to extend its powers so as to bo able to prevent those disgraceful scenes in reference to the relief of the poor .whichhad recently taken place in the metropolis. For himself he tendered his thanks to the chief te of the city for tho cour he hiad pursued on this sujet~. o h oreh
The clause was then agreed to, the BiU passed through committee, and the House resumed.
The Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction BiU was read a second time.
The Customs Duties Bill was read a second time. The Indemnity Bill was read a second time.
The Copyhold and Inclosure Commissions, &c, Billwas read a second time.
The Mnicipal Corporations Aet Amendment Bill was read a second time.
The Racehorse Duties Act Amendment Bill was brought ln and read a first time.
The House then adjourned at 20 minutes past 1I o'clock.
X#ratum.-In our report of the discussion upon the Naval Estimates on Monday evening sonie remarks made by Mr, C. W. Martin were erroneously attributed to Mr. P. W. Martin. Mr. C. W. Martin requested Sir C. Wood not to carry into effect a reduction which was proposed to be made in the wages of the dockyard labourers at Chatham.

LONDON, WEDNESDAY, MARCH , 1857.
In the House of Lords last night
Lord STAnHopr moved certain resolutions regulating the manner of proceeding during divisions.
After a short discusuon the resolations were agreed to.
Some other business was then despatched, after which their Lordships adjourned.
In the House of Commons, before the commencement of public business,
Lord PATZEFSTON, addressing the Chair, said, it had been his duty, on the previous day, to be the organ of expressing to the right hon. gentleman who filled it the regret of the House at the intimation that the new Parliament was not to have the benefit of his assistance in conducting its deliberations. That day, he observed, he had a more agreeabie duty to perform, that of retarning to the SPrEAxJE, by a unanimous vote, the thanks of the House for his able and distinguished services in the chair during 18 years. In awarm eulogy upon those services Lord PAERmsTOx dwelt upon that combination of promptitude of decision, justice of judgment, and firmness of purpose, with the most conciliatory demeanour, wvhich distinguaished the SPAnXEa,, whom no one, he remarked, eve-r approached in search of information, not only without experiencing the most courteous reception, but without receiving the most accurate information in regard to the matter upon which he consulted the Chair. He likewise spoke in terms of strong commendation of the manner in which the SPEARER had contributed to the despatch of the businees of the House, and concluded by moving a vote of thanks to the SPEAxan for his eminent and distinguished services and his exemplary conduct in the chair.
Mr. DIsRABLI seconded the motion, and, in the name of the members seated on the left of the chair, expressed their entire concurrence in this estimate of the qualities and services of the right hon. gentleman during, the eoal eido i
Speaesi;terdp emotion at the separation of the tie which had so long united him to the House, and their affectionate thanks.
Lord J. RusssLa added his cordial concurrence in these sentiments, observing that the proper conduct of the ordinary business of the House had been greatly facilitated by the Sr'rFAn2, who had, he said, marked the line w here it was wise to concede, and where it wras necessary to resist innovation on established forms.
The motion was agreed to nem. con.
The SPEAKER, in a tone of deep feeling-every member of the House uncovering-returned his grateful thanks for this crowning mark of tho favour and approbation of the House.
Lord PAsiusroN rose again, and, in order to give, he said, to the CRowx an opportunity of going hand and hand with the House in acknowledging the greatandeminentservicesof Mr.SPanxaR, moved (following the examples on former similar occasions) an address to HEa AIAJESTY, praying that HER MAJrsTY will be pleased to confer some signal mark of Royal favour upon the right hon. gentleman, asauring hen MaJESTY that the House would make good any evcense attendant upon such mark of
The motion was seconded by Sir J. PA=ToxN, and agreed to nem. con.
Lord PALMERSTOXV further moved the thanks of the House to the SPEAKER for what he had said that day, and that it be etered upon the Journals of the House.
This motion was likewise agreed to.
Mr. T. DuNcoMBB called attention to the grievances complained of in the petitions of the noncommisioned offlcers and drivers of the Land Transport Corps who served during the late war in the Orimea, and mnoved that they be referred to a Select Cvommittee.
The motion was seconded by Sir W. CODRINGTON. 'Ir. F. PaEL explained the circumstances con nected with the raising of the Land Transport Corpp, and offered no objection to the motion. I
After some remarks by Sir J. TYRnl and Sir J. FanOussoN, the motion was agreed to.
The C(hcELLoR of the ExeCEQum obtained leave to bring in a Bill to amend an Act of the last session of Parliament for repealing and re-imposig, under new regulations, the duty on racehorses; and
Mr. WIsON a Bill to amend the Cinque Ports Act.
The House having resolved iteelf into aecmniittee upon the Income-tax Bill,
Sir F. KYLLY, after a general protaet,against this, fint departure, as he deiemed it, from the policy of
the Act of 1853, whereby tht Act mlight become a dead letter, moved to substitute 5d. for 7d. in the pound in the tax upon incomes for- the ennuing year.
The CHaNC Lor of the Exc}Quzx, in oppoudng the amendment, argued that the sup;o-aimoral contract of 1853 had been based upon an asumption that there would be a continuance of peace; but the very foundation of the settlement ha been subverted byr the war. fle observed that, so far as the Government were at present advised, it would not be necessary to make any addition to the Estimates on account of the Chinese war.
The amendment was negatived.
Mr. W. WILraAms moved that incomes below 1501. be exempted from the tax.
The CHxiYCNLorO of the ExcHQxn said the rate of the tax upon this class of persons would be reduced by the Act more than one-half, aud 350,0001. a-year was a larger sum than he felt himsolf justified in asking the House to surrender.
The amendment was negatived upon a division by 53 to 7.
The Bill then passed through the Committee. On the report of the Committee of Supply,
Mr. GLADSTOx moved a resolution that, in order to secure to the country that relief from taxation which it justly expects, it is necessary, in the judgment of this House, to revise and further reduce the expenditure of the State. The position of the House, he said, was peculiar and unexampled. Strong objections were entertained to the amount of the Estimates, and, had the deliberations of the Hoase not been affected by the prospect of a dissolution, the House would probably have remitted the Estimates to the Govemment for further reduction. Of these Estimates, so objected to, one-third was to be voted for four months for no other reason than that the Government had been visited by a vote of censure, and that they had appealed to the country. The effect of his motion was not to assert an abstract principle, or to interpose any obstacle to a vote of supply, but to refer back the Estimates to the Government for reduction, or to express an opinion that they should, during the interval before the next Parliament, apply themselves to the examination of the Estimates, with a view to a reduction of expenditure. He made the motion, he said, upon two grounds; fint, that there did not appear to be an adequate provision for the exigencies of the year; aud, second, that the expenditure of the country had not of late been kept under due control, but had increased to a point which had become embarrassing, andcwhich threatened to become even alarmiing. He then went into details to show that a deficiency of revenue stared the House in the face, and that the expenditure was too high, comparing the Estimates with those of preceding years. The MiEtary Estimates in 1852 were 16,012,0001., whereas this year they were 20,517,0001., being an increase of 4,500,0001. The civil charges, he thought, should be vigilaatly watched, and he objected that the vote for education was getting too large, and that the creation of a Vice-lresident of the Committee of Council on Education had added a new salaried officer, without duties, to discharge slight Parliamentary functions which would be better lodged in the hands of a Cabinet Minister. It appeared to him, he said, that the administration of the public money was conducted under quite a different set of notions and rules from those of 15 or 20 years ago. He adverted, in particular, to the appointments to the judicial bench pending a commission to inquire into the expediency of reducing the number of judges, citing a letter from the late Mr. Baron AxuansoN, wtho was of opinion that 12 judges were sufficient for the Term business.
The amendment was seconded by Mr. W. Win-
LrAIS.
The CEANcELLo of the ExcuHQuir admitted that there was much in the speech of Mr. GLADsToXB which deserved consideration, but he declined to followhimitemby item. Uponthe subject of taxation or revenue, he observed that his plan was limited to the ensuing financial year, and it would be a waste of time to go into an investigation of the revenue and expenditure of succeedingyears He anticipated no deficiency in the ensuig year As to the expenditure, he did not understand that the House, by voting sums on account, had approved the Estimates; a new Parliament would be competent to examine them. He did not believe that the Estimates, though large, were extravagant, the most energetic efforts having been made by the Government to reduce them. Noticingsome of the criticisms of Mr. GLADSTONX, Sir C. LBwis justified the appointments to the jndicial bench, observing that the issue of a commission ahowed that the Government had not neglected the question; and that, vacancies having occurred before the circuits could be reconstituted and changes could be made in the law that would enable a smaller number of judges to perform the duties required of the Bench, the Goverument had no alternative but to fill up those vacancies.
After some remarks by Mr. GLTh and Mr. NEw-
DEGATE,
Mr. DI)Ismu protested against a proposal thrown out in the course of the discussion to refer the Estimates, which ought to be framed upon the responsibility of the Government, to a committee, and expressed a hope that the new Parliament would hold the Governmnent well to their duty.
Sir H. WIVoUnBouy said a few words, and the amendment was then negatived.
The report was agreed to.
The Extra-Parochial Places Bill passed through Committee.
Other bills were advanced a stage, and the House adjourned at 20 minutes past I1 o'clock.
On no point are opinions so strong and dif-
On no point are opinions so strong and differences so great as the frequent question, " What " is to be considered the rightful state of affairs " It might be supposed that a number of persons may agree to subscribe so much money in such a way for such a purpose, or for their general expenditure, without creating any of that eternal and indefeasible right which is part of the constitution of the moral universe, and paramount over aU questions of human convenience. It might be imagined that the subscribers, being voluntary to begin with, and having parted with none of their liberty, may from month to month, or year to year, either increase their subscription or diminish it, or raise it by this rule or by that rule, entirely according to the convenience of the hour, and without exposing themselves to the imputation of breach of faith,-that is, of treachery to their own honourable selves. If any case of trust could be proved, and the subscribers were dealing with the funds of other persons committed to them under express understandings, then it might be shown, perhaps, that they had not been true to that trust. But, in the absence of any such limited trust, we cannot for the life of us see how people can be treacherous to themselves; how A. B. C. can be traitors to A. B. C., and use them so wrongfully that the Nictims of their violence and oppression shaU diminish into A. B. C. in comparison with the mighty robbers and fraudulent dealers still retaining their dignity represented by the larger letters, or even a higher dignity. The British Parliament, in a time of peace, agreed to a certain tax upon income. In a time of war it revised and otherwise altered that tax. We are now arrived at a state of things which is neither quite war nor quite peace, in aU financial respects, inasmuch as we have not yet paid aU our War Bills, and are, generally, rathertheworse for the past war, besides having our eyes opened by it to some longstanding wants. So why may we not, by virtue of our indefeasible so-ereignty and our unabated power, now proceed. to tax ourselves according to' the precise character of our present position t As a general rule, the British people in its Parliament has as much the liberty of self-taxation as a book club, or a dinner club, or the subscribers to a pack of hounds, or any other object. The only exception to that rule is where it is dealing with the property of persons who may not be represented in it, or not sufficiently represented, and who may, on the faith of one Act, make a dispition of their property which a fi~tu` Actniay render inconvenient. But eveoL this exceptioncman be dealt with in the way af
0on1pena1tion. 'go, there is no real limit to the light of a nation, or of a Legisltmo representing and governing a nation, to tax, and unta, and retax, and further tax, and in every wsy tax themselves, from year to year, as the circumstances of each year may suggest.
Yet a distinguished lawyer, as Sir FrrzRoy KIY is, following in the wake of Mr. GLADSIONE, can be found to state gravely that a basis of right has been founded by the Income-tax Act of 1853. According to this lawyer that Act has created a foundation of legal justice, which it becomes an immorality to depart from under any circumstances whatever short of actual raging war. So Sir FrxzRoy K=y protests against any act inconsistent with that Act, as a man might protest against a forcible entry into his premises, or an invasion of his estate, or the abstraction of his goods. He has no wish whatever to obstruct the Govermuent in raising the supplies realy necessary for the public ervice, but to save his conscience, to protect his property, and secure his independence, or to perform those services for some imaginary client, Sir FrrzRoy must needs record his solemn protest against tis first departure from the Act of 1853. Was Magna Charta ever more strenuously insisted on t Was more chivalry ever shown for the Sacred Plawes I Did men ever fight or die more bravely for their country ortheir faith? Well, it must be confessed this is not the first time that solemn protests have been lavished in behalf of unreal, not to say unrighteous, rights. A settlement of three hundred years, or of one hundred years, ay, of ten, is an eternal obligation in the eyes of those who are interested in it. But in this case there is not even the pretence that anybody is more interested in maldng the tax 5d., instead of 7d., this next year than the members of the Legislature themselves. Theyall of them pay the tax, the whole body pay a much greater aggregate than any other equal body of men in the kingdom. Have they not a right,then,to pay'd. insteadof 5d., if they pleaset Sir F rznoy KELLY has so profound a conviction to the contrary that he saves his soul from evil compromise by a solemn protest. He stands up in the House and goes through a solemn form of expurgation, washing his hands of the additional 2d. over and above the 6d., which, by right divine, is all that ought to be paid. Does this raise our estimate of legal opinions or our reverence for conscientious protests T May we now flatter ourselves that we have a martyr among us, a man who would die at the stake for a Heaven-sent truth? If the Act of 1853, repealed as it was by the Act of 1855, is all the foundation of the right of which Sir FrrzRoy KELLY is the devoted champion and the suffering confessor, then we are sorry to say the only conclusion we can come to is that lawyers sometimes assume grimaces fitter for the stage, and that pantomimes are performed in the Theatre Royal, St. Stephen's.
We beg a truce to this spirit of exaggeration, which is destroying the force of the gravest words, eating into the self-respect of statesmen, and damaging the character of Parliament in the eyes of the people. That people, of course, has too much sense to be deceived by a political protest in the mouth of a lawyer or an ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer against twopence in the pound upon incomes. They don't believe in the figment of a solemn " compact," for they see no " contracting" parties in the affair. They see a resolution contingent on circumstances, and in the change of circumstances they see reason enough for the change of resolution. Accordingly, as the Cu,cELr.Lo
of the EXCnsuQux says, " the general sense "and rude appreciation of the country, entirely "overlooking the niceties and refinements of the "hon. and learned gentleman, asked from the "Government nothing, more than the surrender of "what was called 'the War Nmepence."' No doubt the abandonment of prospective schemes of taxation and the substitution of new rates according to the wants of the day may not be very flattering to the vanityof the financiers who devised these benevolont inroads on futurity. We can imagine nothing more agreeable, short of the actual posssion of office, than to see year after year a tax languishing, decaying, shrinking away to nothing, from a death wound inflicted by one's own hand years before. It would have been a great consolation to Mr. GLADsTo,-E if from the dreary depths of secession he could have beheld many a tax stricken by his own hand and gradually yielding to its fate. "Hcsret lateri eUialis aruando," he would have exclaimed, even when he was not himself in a position to appropriate the wounded prey, and could only glory in its doom. His successor has not dealt so kindly with this natural longing as might bave been expected, for Sir G. C. LEwis has the sportsman's ambition to bag his own game. He has killed his own taxes in his own fashion, and hopes the grateful nation will read his virtues in their gradual and final extinction. We admit it was natural Mr. GLADSTONE should be nianed-
but he has not had the magnanimity to suppress his pique, or even the discretion to conceal it, and is accordingly trying first one dodge, then another, to hark back the House, or, if n6t the Rouse, at least the public, to his own prospective Budget. His last is the revision and further reduction of the expenditure. We do not think this can be done to any considerable amount this year, certainly not in the course of this fortnight. The motion, therefore, amounts to a mere bid for popularity, and is nothing more nor less than a hustings cry. It has no substantial value, for the simple reason that nothing can now be done with it; and it is therefore as much a figure of speech and a piece of political acting as the course of philippics against any departure from the Budget of 1853.
Philanthropy in former days was not an agree-
Philanthropy in former days was not an agreeable pastime. A man who devoted himself to raise the fallen, to succour the indigent, to cleanse the gaol, or transport-hulk, or slave-ship, had need of a vigorous will, a burning and yet constant enthusiasm, a strong frame, and not over-delicate nerves; for in those days men did things themselves, and not through the agency of societies, with an office, a secretary, and In organization for colossal begging. JoHnx HowARD, like an Apostle of old, went to the places and nmixed with the people that he wished to reform, and he had his reward in an early grave and the admiation of the world. But modern philanthropy does not run such dangers, and wil hardly excite such gratitude. The Parliamentary lover of his kind leads a by no means unpleasant life. He converts the heathen, succours the afflicted, and civilizes the barbarian, without ever seeing a ragged garment or a tawny akin. He is the chairman of meetings and the lion of soirWs, on account of his interest in populations which he has never visited and his knowledge of the moral state of islands which he could not point out on the map. So far has this been carried that there is nov. rather a competition for objects of humanity. So far from any class or people suffering from the neglect of our home philanthropists, there is rather a struggle who shaU make the subject his own, and rise in the estimation of the humanitarian world by his able advocacy of the cause. If any one wishes to wse to what a point this may be Carried, let him satisfy himself by reading the debate on the Opium Trade which took place on Monday evening in the House of Lords.
The whole. substance of the motion is to be fouxnd in the assertion that opium is a deleterious
drug, and that therefore to elU it must be i crime. WhethertheChinesedealers land it contrary to certain orders from Pekin, and we are cone quently abettors in smuggling, is, of course, but a secondary question. The real object of reprobAtioni
the traffic in h drug which produces when taken to excess intoxication, nervous debility, and loss of mental power. The question in this shape might well occupy a conclave of easuists or form the subject for a moral essay; but we can hardly imagine an assembly of legislators allowing their poliey to be influenced by any arguments adduced by the advocates of total suppression. Let us see how the matter stands, There is a plant fhe juice of which has the extraordinary property of soothing pain, allaying feverish excitement, calming the nervous system, arnd imparting, when used in moderation, great physical comfort to the taker. This drug is in large and constant use in every part of the world. Scareely a household is without a phial of it; carcely an individual does not resort to it occasionaUy to obtain relief from bodily suffering. But it happens that opium, which is seldom used but medicinally in Europe, is consumed throughout Asia in the same manner as tobacco, `-wine, and spirits are consumed with us. The uIumulman populations, the Hindoos, and the Chinese, who are forbidden to drink stimulating liquors, or cannot obtain them, make use of opium-some generally, others almost universally. The Chinese are addicted to this practice, and Cqsider it a necessity of life. Of course, among this population there are many who indulge immoderately in the use of the narcotic, just as there are thousands in this country who, with bleared eyes and trembling hand, carry the dram of gin to their mouths as often as they can get a few pence to spend. The pictures given by travellers of the effects of opium-eating are no doubt terrible, and their effect is increased by our own ignorance of the habit, but we doubt whether the most abandoned debauchees of Canton would present a more deplorable spectacle than the drunkards of our own streets. In fact, according to all accounts, there is temperance in opiurmeating as in other things, and, although there are many who practise intemperance, these are not the majority. The habit of eating opium in some quantity is universal, and answers to cigar-smoking in our own day and snuff-taking in that of our fathers. Now, the finest opium in the world is produced within the limits of our Indian empire. So much is the produce of MIalwa and the neighbouring districts valued that the Chinese wil take any quantity of it which is brought to their shores. Consequently it is one of the staples of the country. A great part of the Indian revenue depends on its steady cultivation and profitable sale at Canton, Shanghai, and other ports. Destroy the opium trade and you cut off a large portion of the revenues of India, and have no product to exchange for the silks and teas of China. The case would, then, seem simple enough. We grow this drug, which is sought for purposes of healing or gratification all over the world, and the Chinese are our best customers for it. The commerce is mutuaUy advantageous, and would seem to deserve encouragement, or, at all events, liberty. But because the use of opium sometimes passes into abuse we have a party demanding the abolition of the traffic, and the drying up of one of the chief sources of our Indian prosperity. The morals of the Chinese and the childish simplicity of their natures, which our practices have a tendency to corrupt, are descanted upon in the usual tone. Our merchants are charged with drawing a large population into a frightful vice for the sake of gain.
Now, it is strange that people who are at one time urging the genius, the cultivation, and the noble institutions of the Chinese should at another represent them as in a state of Arcadian simplicity. The fact is that the countrymen of YEH have nothing to learn from us as to sharpness and shrewdness, however deficient they may be in moral qualities. They are certainly among the cleverest traders in the world, their diplomatic communications are sufficiently artful, and they are in all respects perfectly able to take care of themselves. They eat foreign opium just as we drink French brandy, and the Government, being imbued with Protectionist principles, has been willing to support the native producers. Hence the edicts against introducing it into the country. But, as such economical expedients are generally failures, it has been found that the sea-coast provinces will not be stinted, and will take all that our vessels bling. The natives come on board, buy, and carry away the coveted drug, which they then smuggle on shore, if we may use such an expression to describe a process which is carried on -with the full knowledge of the whole tribe of officials. It is evident, therefore, that we take no advantage of their innocence, and do not lead them into temptation. But, as some people will say that this is special pleading, we will put the issue on a broader ground-namely, that opiuln has become a necessary of life to these populations, and that its moderate use is not only not injurious, but has actually become essential. In the report of an inquiry which took place some time since respecting the mortality among Chinese emigrants on board the ship Duke of Portland we learn that opium is looked upon as one of the ship's stores, just as lemonjuice is in an English emigrant-ship. A deficiency of the drug in this case was, we are positively assured, partly the cause of the mortality. The master of the vessel says, " The "opium prescribed by law was put on board in
China, and I got more at St. Helena." With regard to the want of it on the passage, he says, "We could seethedifferencebetweenthose whodied "from congestive fever and those who suffered from "the want of opium." Where we find the lowest class of the population thus requiring the drug from constant habit, we certainly cannot join in the declamations of those who would prohibit its cultivation and shlipment. The comparison which arises to the mind of every sensible man is obvious. Opium is in the same category as wine, or brandy, or gin, or tobacco. Are our distillers enemies to their race, are the planters of Virginia and Cuba to be denounced, are
France and Spain to send us no longer the produce of their vineyards, because people drink, and smoke, and chew more than is good for them? If the moderate use of these is to be allowed, why should we join in invectives against those who sell the production which is tae equivalent of them to 300,000,000 of men t
In the House of Commons on Monday evening
In the House of Commons on Mondsy evening Sir CHARLES W OOD obtained votes on account of each item of the Navy Estimates to the amount of one-third of the total sum which the service of the year had been presumed to require. The Debate which occurred was, of course, under the peculiar c-rcumstances of the occasion, not very diffuse, but one or two points of considerable interest were elicited, and especiaUy that 'which related to the manning of the fleet. Few naval questions created more discussion . seemed to involve greater diffilculties some years ago than this, whereas wc are now informed not only that efficient systems of reserves are coming into operation, but that the service is too popular to allow men to quit it, and that this disposition of trained *eamen to stand by their ships has- actually prevexted. the reduction of tho number of men to the whole extent desired. The ctedit of this reuilt must probably be tistribnted over a variety of
bmessures and among several claimants. Admiral
szoimm testified to the deserts of Admiral BmxRr:zr in the matter, while Admiral BERxznY asigned great praise to the exertions of Sir JAzs GRAHAM. Of the fact itself, however, there seems no doubt. A combination of improvements in pay, provisions, and treatanent, joined to a good system for securing the Zervices of seamen desirous of being retained, has iad its effect, and the public, we feel assured, will be perfectly ready to accept the result. Out of Z3,000 sailors at present employed in the Navy =a many as 23,500 are men engaged for ten years, and Sir CHARiES WOOD informed the House that when a ship was paid off the other day, the entire crew of which was serving upon these terms, not a single man was inclined to leave. Sir Cl}ARLES NiAruI expressed his apprehension that the country sometimes got hard bargains in men, who might thus entitle themselves to claim 10 years' employment without in all cases being good enough to 4eserve it-a contingency evidently not iimprobable. We should not imagine, however, that these accidents would be numerous enough to affect materially the utility of a system so plainly boneficial, though perhaps some such plan of probation ts Sir CRARLES suggested might help to diminish the risk.
With regard to the total amount of the force wiich, under these circumstances, has been retained, wve really cannot consider it as calling for much oxcue Ii the score of excess. Possibly 53,700 anen mtiy seem a large vote, but this is an aggregate composed of three departments. Thero are not 53,700 seamen " to be employed in HER cc "MAf7rTv's Fleet,"but only 33,000, and evon this -number includes 2,000 boys in cours. of training afloat. The remainder of the force is made up of -',700 Coastguardsmen and 15,000 MIarines. Mr. 'W. WILLIAMS did, indeed, complain especially of this latter item, but he could hardly have .nade a more unlucky hit. There was a time when the Marines were regarded as neither soldiers nor sailors, but they are now more justly looked upon as being both, and as uniting the advantages of the two forces in one body. Mr. WUIA-Us thought the number too large " as 4' compared with the number of seamen ;" and, 'though he bore testimony to the utility of the -corps, he considered " they were not now so " efficient as they once were in Consequence of the " introduction into the fleet of long-range guns." But these remarks appear to limit the service of the Marines to that of small-ann men on -board their respective vessels, whereas their extraordinary usefulness consists in the fact that, while they are Very valuable afloat, they are equally serviceable ashore. The Marines of a squadron repreGent a regiment of admirable soldiers, and thus enable our ships to carry with them the ma-terials of an efficient land force, not only without -encumbrance, but with a positive increase of available hands. .We are convinced that no objection Uo this eminently useful force could ever be sustained, or be ever likely to find favour with the -country. Sir CnARLES NArrEa truly observed, that in time of peace they would form good ,garrisons for seaport towns, and, on the occurrence of war, -could be promptly marched on board ship, while the Militia might replace them on shore.
As respects the demands for the mnat&idl of the Navy, the Debate ran pretty much upon the old lines both on one side and the other. Objectors talked about the interminable expenditure upon " stores" and "works ;" Government pleaded the exigencies of a " steam marine." We must confess we should like to get a clearer glimpse of the end of this costly creation than the authorities seem to -offer. Sir C. WOOD did, indeed, say that " before " long" we might occupy a desirable position in these respects, but at present wve are still, " in " point of fact, creating a steam navy," and " a " considerable expenditure must be looked for for .' some time to come." The truth is that these self-moving monsters of the ocean are incessant in their demands from the first moment of their existence to the last. A steamship in its original construction costs one-third morethan a sailing ship; its machinery is liable to special wear and tear, and calls for special outlay in the way of repais; the length and dimensions given to this class of vessels require new docks; new docks swallow up vast heaps of money; and, finaly, there is the constant consumption of coals to supply the actual motive -ower. This last item alone Sir C. WooD puts down at 200,0001. for the year, which is close upon a quarter of the whole charge for the victuals of our 53,700 men.
It seems that this unceasing drain has induced the Admliralty to try a curtailment of expenditure -by desiring commanders of vessels with auxiliary steam power to be chary in its use, and not to -employ it except in cases of need. Admiral DluNcosNa, Admiral PECiELL, and Sir C. WOOD, all concurred in their remarks upon this point, and Sir CHARLES even added that the practice of steaming instead of sailing might, if unnecessarily pursued, even tend to deteriorate the skill of our -officers; so that the interests of seamanship as weU ,as of economiiy were at stake in the matter. We are now told that officers are required to state in -their logs not only every occasion on which steam is got up, but the reason for the proceeding, -nd an effective check will therefore be applied, That steam, however, wiU be always costly is but ,too plain. A signal instance of the exigencies thus entailed upon us was related in the Debate. Government, as will be remembered, purchased the noble steamer Himalaya for the transport of troops, but there was not a dock in the QUE-_;'s yards which would hold her when she needed repairs, and the -consequence was that to provide accommodation for her it became necessary to take down the head of the newest dock we had got. Supposing, moreover, that the new American model of a frigate should be approved, there is but one dock in the kingdom, as Sir CHARPLES WOOD told the House, -which would hold a vessel of such a class.
At the same time, however, that these liabilities loom so disagreeably before us, it is not to be -denied that we find our advantages on the other side of the account. Just at this moment it is de,irable in the extreme to insure the safety of our -countrymen in China with the greatest possible despatch, and our Military and Naval Intelligence -of Monday contained striking evidence of the
-effect with wlhch measures can now be taken for the purpose. A force of between 4,000 -nd 5,000 men was ordered for embarcation, and of this the Himalaya alone was
expected to take at least two regiments; so that if only land troops were wanted a couple of vessels of this size and power would actually suffice -to carry the whole expedition at full speed acro3s the globe. When we see such results it may re-concile us a little to their cost. If modern armamsnents are expensive they are at any rate effective too, and aU that the country requires is that there -should be no unproductive or unnecessary outlay, but that the publio expenditure should be confined to objects giving adequate promise of return.

PARIS, MAcH 9, 6 P.M.
The Conference on the Neuchatel question held no sitting t-day, and it is not quite certain whether there will be one to-morrow. But, whether tomorrow or the day after, Dr. Kern will be allowed to make his bow as Plenipotentiary for the Helvetic Confederation. It is a little provoking for those who feel interest in the proceedings that they will be carried on with closed doors; and that the members are quite as much bound to secresy as the great Congress which discussed the Peace Treaty with Rlusia last year. From the fact of no meeting being held to-day it is inferred by some that M. de Hatzfeldt, the Prussian Minister, intimated on Saturday that he had not meceivea powers to treat on the basis proposed,-namely, the renunciation of the King of Prussia's sovereignty over Neuchttel. I am not aware bow far this may be true; but it is certain that at that meeting M. de Hatzfeldt laid before the Plenipotentiaries the conditionsonwhichhewould treat. Dr. Kerwillpropose his terms at the next meeting ; and the subsequent labour of the Plenipotentiaries will be to find a middle term satisfactory to both parties, for the Swiss as well as the Prussians wiiU be expected to make concessions. This is all-that can be said with any certainty at present. Some people think that the Conference wiU be brought to a close during the present week; others, and with some reason, incline to the belief that matters cannot be despatched so quickly.
I have already announced the arrival in Paris of Prince Daniel. He had an interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs to-day. The object of his visit is to secure the influence of France in favour of his demand, that the hereditary power should be established in his family, with the complete independence of AIo'ntenegro; or rather, that the Porte should formaUy recognize that independence whicb has existed in fact forthelast century. Austria and Turkey are, it seems, opposed to the claim; but there is no doubt of his being backed by Russia.
It is stated that the Austrian Government has intimated its willingness to withdraw aU opposition to the union of the Principalities on condition that the Powers sbaU guarantee the possession of the Rouman population who acknowledge her sway, and who amount to over 4,000,000. The latest newvs from the Danubian provinces received by the French Government is to the effect that the evacuation by the Austrian troops, which had been rus-
pended, recommenced on the 26th of February; J ard it is believed will be completed by the middle of the present month.
A letter from St. Petersburg of the 29th of February, published in the Assehblie Natioxale says:
" The obstinacy with which Austria persists in her opposi. tiontothe union of the Danubian provinces has loudly caUed forth a very energetio note from our Government. Austria first endeavoured, but unsuccessfuly, to repreaent the prolonged occupation by her troops as rather favourable than otherwise to the free mauifestation of opinion in the Divans; but when Count Baol was informed by his agents that this affected anxiety about tranquiUlity in the Principalities was bafly reoeived by the people he changed his tactics, and declared that he would evacuate that territory within the period fixed, but that he thought he ought to form a corps of observation on the Moldo-Wallschian frontier until the important question being agitated in the provinces should be settled. He stated that in so doing he was complying with the wislhes of the Sultan. Scarcely had this declaration reached St. Petersburg than Prince Gortschakoff announced to Count Buol, through the Baron de Budberg, that the Russian Government would reply to the formation of an Austrian corps of observation on the Wallachian frontier by the formation of a Russian corps on the Moldavian frontier, to create
counterpoise to the pressure exercised by Austria on public opinion. This categorical reply will, no doubt, induce the Austrian Gorernment to abandon the projected plan."
The (Constitutionnel has broken the silence it has hitherto maintained on the Parliamentary crisis in England; it does Lord Pahnerston the honour to approve his policy. M. de Cesena, the writer of the article, sees a close analogy between the coalition, the "fortuitous concourse of atomis," that defeated the Premier on WVednesdaynight, and that which upset Count Mol6 in 1839. ML de Cesena apprehends that the institutions in England are now about to be submitted to a serious ordeal, as he seemed to think that the stone-throwing in Hyde Park some time ago was the beginming of a social and political revolution in the British empire-in fact, the 1789 of England. If M. de Cesena's judgment on the state and prospects of England be on a par with his knowledge of its geography, I fear not much weight will be attached to it. M. de Cesena informs his readers, through the columns of the Cowntitutionnel, that the " West Riding" is the " Partie Orientale de Londres !"-the " East End of London." This, I presume, is sufficient.
The increased facility for discounts granted by the Directors of the Bank of France at their last meeting has not yet produced the good effect expected, for trade is still dull in Paris. The manufacturers have merely sufficient orders on hand to keep their operatives ermployed, with the exception of a few houses which manufacture gilt bronzes and other " articles of Paris," which are doing a moderate business for foreign countries. The shopkeepers complain that the season is perfectly dead, and that there is no demand for any articles of ladies' dress but silks, shawls, and lace. The accounts from the manufacturing districts are equally unsatisfactory. The high price of theraw materialrendersitvery difficult forthe Lyons manufacturers to execute their commissions. The prospect for the future is still worse, and a contract is said to have been concluded between an eminent Lyons house and an Italian company for a supply of cocoons of the next sea'on at the enormous price of lOf. the kilogramme. The manufacturers of Rouen, Mulhouse, and Elbeuf, notwithstanding their many disappointments, are still confident that better times are approaching, and in Alsace the millowners speak of reducing the hours of labour. This plan they consider to be the only one by which the price of spun cotton can be raised. It is generally admitted, however, that the high price of the raw material is the great cause of the present stagnation in trade. It is remarked that the articles for which there is the least demand are those required by the middle and lower classes, such as plain and printed cottons. Articles of luxury purchased by the more wealthy classes find a ready sale at remunerative prices. The fancy shops in Paris, which were well supplied at the beginniDg of winter with costly silks, are now exhausted, notwithstanding the exorbitant price of those articles. Letters from the seaports state that colonial produce, such as sugar, coffee, and cocoa, is still rising in price, and that the stocks on hand are much reduced. The last letters from Newr York state that the importation of French produce into that port during the last month was enormous, and, as the sales made were by no means in the same proportion, it is feared .that there are not many orders to be expected from that quarter. The Paris corn-market is quiet, and sales cannot be effected at less than a reduction of 50 centimes the hectolitre oxr wheat, as compsred with the quotations of the preceding week. WTheat of the finest quality is quoted at 30E. the hectolitre. Inferior quality is not saleable. Good German wheat was offered at the last market at 41f. the sack of 120 kilogrammes, but could find no buyers. Wheat continued to arrive at Marseilles in large quantities, and a slight decline of prices followed, but a change of wind on Friday last restored firmness to the
market, notwithstanding that the demand from Spain has considerably decreased. The price of butchers' meat is gradually increasing in Paris, so much so that the principal demand is for cow beef. Wines of every quality maintain tlleir price both at Bercy and in the wine-growing districts, nor is there any change expected until the next vintage, Opinions are divided as to the state of the vines. Some vinedressers Fretend that they have discovered black wood, which is a bad si2n. Others consider the vines to have a very bealfhy appearance. Old wine at Macon ia beyond all price. New wine maintains its value. The winemarket at Pezenas is more brisk than that of Bordeaux. Ordinary wine sells there at from 180f. to 200f., uad better quality at from 300f. to 325f. the cask of 700 litres. The Paris market is overstocked with spirits of wine distilled from beetroot. It is quoted at 1191. the 100 litres.

TURKEY.
(FROM OUR OWN CORRFMPONDM.)
CONSTANTINOPLE, FES. 27.
Kiamil Bey, Master of the Ceremonies, and Cabouli Effendi, Chief Interpreter to the Porte, left yesterday in the Varnasteamer, carrying, the formaer to Bucharest, the latter to Jassy, the Imperial Firman of Convocation of the Divans ad hoc, which has already appeared in your columns. As the time approaches when these assemblies wil meet, the que.tion of union of the Principalities, which must necessarily be considered by them in the first instance, is becoming more and more a subject of discussion with the different parties interested, each endeavouring to. put forward argonnents in favour of their own peculiar views to guide their adherents, br in the hope of convincing their opponents. The article which appeared recently in the £Ilonitelr, showing clearly that the French Government wishes the union, and wiUl likely use its influence to promote it, has not been much relished here. The union naturally appears to the Turks as the severing of the last weak link of the chain whicb still binds these Principalities to the Ottoman erapire. The partisans of the union may put forward as much as they like that Moldavia and WaUachia united will become a strong and effectual barrier to Russian encroachments on the Danube, but the Turk feels thatwhentbey are united, no matter what German or native princely family supplies the Governor, Russian influence, which in the past has always preponderated in each of the Principalities separately, is stiU likely to preponderate in the union, and probably to act more efficaciously against the interests of the Porte, because its action will be more concentrated. It is very possible that, united under one Government, and endowed with good and providant institutions, Moldavia and Wallachia may prosper and become a rich and powerful State. But is the union necessary to their material prosperity? There can be no doubt that the union will be a step towardstheir complete independence of Turkey, and it is not to be wondered at that the patriotic feelings and aspirations of the national party in both provinces should eagerly wish for it; but for these same reasons the Turkish Government can scarcely be expected to favour it; nor does it appear how it can allow the Divans about to be assembled to pronounce in favour of the union without relinquishing to a xerious extent its suzerain rights. A great deal of discussion has been recently expended in endeavouring to establish a distinction between the suzerain and sovereign rights of the Sultan, and it really scems that the discussion has only tended to increase the confusion. I, for one, confess that I am unable to appreciate the nicety of the distinction in this instance. The Sultan, by his Imperial authority, has issued a firman convoking Divans in two provinces of his empire, carefuUy limiting the powers of thoseDivans,whenassembled, to a mere expression of wishes, and not the most ardent defender of the simple suzerainetM of the Sultan appears to object to this principle of the firman. -How it can be shown that the Sultan has not exercised a sovereign right by this act I am at a loss to conceive. This act implies power more absolute than that of the Queen when she convokes Parliament, for the Parliament once assembled has powers and attributes independent of the Crown. The Divans of Moldo-Wallachia, if true to their mandate, can exercise no such power whatever; and the probability is that they will be as impotent in showing the real wants and wishes of the population as t<hey will be incapable of enacting anything in accordance wvith those wants and wishes. Never was there a greater political error than when the Turkish Plenipotentiary at the Conference of Paris bound hs Government to consult the populations of MIoldo-Wallachia. By this act he surrendered without authority from his master one of the sovereign rights and prerogatives of the Sultan. The Sultan is an absolute monarch, and were the object gradualy to weaken his power, so as in time to achieve his final overthrow, it would be logical to compel him to surrender one by one his absolute rights, and call up to independence province after province of his empire. But it will be difficult to convince anybody that by such a policy we mean to insure the independence and maintenance of tIe Ottoman empire, even though we put forward the pretext of ame:liorating the condition of the Christian populations of Turkey. A-s far as the interests of the Principalities are concerned, there is no doubt that what they really require is a strong Government, whichwillprornotetheirmaterialwelfare,openupcom- munications, improve the condition of the peasantry, and so favour the development of agriculture, their natural source of wealth, encourage education, and create industry. That these objects wil not be attained by the mere act of union there is no doubt; everything will still have to be done, aud perhaps the difficulties will have increased. To the existing causes of faction and dissension the union will add new ones. There are many princely families in each of the provinces, and if a governor or prince is appointed out of one of these he will have to contend with the united opposition and intrigues of all the others; and, besides, the rivalry of the two provinces is so great that it will be all but a hopeless task so to blend the Moldavian and Wallachian elements in the central Government as to satisfy anybody. If, on the contrary, a foreign prince is imported and placed at the head of the State, the happy experinent so successfully tried in Greece may help us to form an idea of -what the consequences wMl be. The circumstances are of a most serious character, and require all the attention not only of the Turkish Government, but of all the Powers which have agreed to maintain the integrity of the Ottoman empire. If its dismemberment is allowed to commence on the Danube by the separation of Wallachia and Moldavia, Serva will soon follow their example; and who can foretell where the torrent will stop when it once begins to run?
We have just emerged from the carnival, which in Constantinople is as gay as in any continental city. It is the season of the year when the Turks used to say that all the Christians went mad, but this periodic madness has now extended to them, and In a ball at Pera there are now almost as many Turks to be seen as Christians, and some of them,too, have learnt not only to stand up in a salow quadrille, but also to take their full fling of the maddening and eccentric evolutions of a cotillon. One of the last and most brilliant fetes of this season was a bal costuo,mi d'enfans at the British Embassy, and there was this remarkable about it, that among the children of the Europeans, and Armenians, and Jews, were seen mixing and dancina the young daughters of some of the highest Turkish digmtaries. These little girls were, some of them, of an age to remember, as they grow up, the amusements of the Franks in which they will have mixed in their childhood, and who knows what great changes in the social customs of the Turks may be prepared by thus accustoming the young girls of the rising gendration to mx in European society ? The ball-going propensitie3 of the population have also just been made to lend themselves to a useful and elevatng ublic object. We have many poor in Constantinople, and public charity is but little organized. AnnuaUly, however, a ball is given m Pera in aid of the poor and sick, withoutnationalorreligious distinction. Thisyear our Ambassador and Lady Stratford de Redcliffe kindly took this ball under their patronage, and appealed to all classes of society to support them in their laudable undertaking. So eagerly has this appeal been responded to by every one that an unusually large sum has been raised by the bal
anoi, alter paying all expenses, more than 3,0001| sterling will remain to be divided among the poor. Thnis showvs that there is no lack of public spirit in
Constvantinople; it; only requires a head to direct it.|

(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPON-DKNT.)
VIENNA, HARoIt 7.
Almost all the leading organs of the German and Austrian press are of opinion that the conduct of the agents of the British Government towardathe Chinese authorities at Canton was perfectly 'ustifiable. Several well-written aticles have, 4rng. the lat day or two been published on th1., sbject, but there is one ii the Augabnwg GczzoN of to-day which is m qery muoh to tb.a purplibat it de.
seves especial noAk, The following is a brief summary of it&-
"Tho attack made by the Chinese on a ship under British coloms was a violation of the intemational law as eablished by the Treaty of Nankin and by the supplementary convention. The Britishauthorities wre bound todemand &atisfaction, and if they had not done so tbey must have Incurred thedispleassof theirGovernment. If theChinese had been Allowed to offend with impunity, the neighbour. hood of Canton would soon have become uninhabitable for Europeaus. The only secraity for the European factories at Canton is the real or imaginary power of the States under whoseprotectiontbe stand. The pulling down of a flag at Canton is eqgivalent to a declaration that the Christian merchants are at the meray of the populace. This it the unanimous opinion of those persons who have ever been engaged in mercantile affairs at Canton, and they are therefore of opinioa that the measu±es taken by Sir AL Seymour Were absolutely necessary."
The news that the land trade between Russia and China is not to be interrupted, although the five ports to which European nations have hitherto traded are to be closed, cannot fail to make a deep impression on those persons who are aware of the territorial acquisitions which have been made by Russia in a southerly direction duriug the last ten years, and of her influence at Pekin. On a small map, which was published in the last number of Petermnann's Communirations relative to New and Important Geographical Investiqations, it is to be seen that the territory which the Russians have acquired in Mantehouria extends on the coast of the Sea of Japan to the 44th degree of north latitude. In the west the fron,tier line of the Russian acquisitions in Mautchour.a is formed by the river Argun. That Petermann obtained his information at no bad source you will see by the subjoined passage, which is translated from an article entitled Peschtschuroff's Survey of the River Amoor in the year 1855.
" In an important document' in the Russian langunge, which is now before us, the nature of the protepsions and claims of Russia to and on the north-eastern part of the Cbinese empire is clearly seen. In this work, which appeared four years ago,almest the whole of Mantchouria, and the whole of the island of Sachalin (Saghalien), are marked as belonging to the Russian empire."
The Oesterreichische Correspondenz of yesterday evening contained a short article'on financial matters which has produced a favourable impression on the public. On the 31st of August, 1854:, the Finance
epartment ceded to the Bank; the nominal sum of 168,000,000fl., beig part of a loan made on the 26th of June, 1854, as payment of a portion of the debt of the Statetothe Bank. It was expected that 134,500,000f1. would be in the hands of the Bank by the 24th of August, 1858, but the whole sum was already paid in before the end of February, 1857. The difference between the abovementioned sums the Bank has now to hand over to the Finance Department, so that there is no necessity for a new loan. In addition to the remainder of the loan of 1854 the State still has to receive a great part of the so called" INational Loan," as also the amount in hard cash, for which some of the State property (railroads, estates, mines, &c.) was not long since sold.
The report that the far-famed " Last Supper," by Leonardo daVinci, is to be " restored," is incorrect. The Milan correspondent of a German newspaper writes that the parts of the fresco which were warped or had b me loose have been skldfully refixed by M. Baressi, but no one ever thought of "touching up" the painting. The refectory itself, which now looks like a hay magazine, is to be cleaned and repaired, and a direct communication with the street is to be opened. The projected door would be directly opposite the " Last Supper," but it could not possibly be made without breaking through the " Crucifixion," by bIontorfano. It is also rumoured that the "Sposalizio " by Raphael is to be " refreshed." The officers who committed such a brutal asault on MI. Bianchi at Mantua are awaiting their trial in a military prison.

For two days she had been suffering, so much so, indeed, that it was found necessary, so I am informed, to send for the relics of San Gennaro, and Signor de Renzis, an accoucheur extraordinary. The event was announced to the public by the firing of salutes from the various castles, and the ships in port were immediately decorated. About 2 o'clock two strong patrols of cavalry went through the streets. In the evening the public offices, and, of course, many private houses were illuminated. Over the manuifactory of arms, in the Largo di Castello, was the usual transparency of their Majesties, as large as life, all beplumed and bespangled; in the Largo Mereatello, over the entrance to the Jesuits' College, the municipality had prepared another large transparency, representing the Eing and Queen in the foreground, while the Madonna, rising above all, seems to envelope them in the ample and protecting folds of her mantle. The military barracks were everywhere illuminated, and bands of music played in every part of the city. These and other external signs of rejoicing, with salvoes of artillery three times a- day, will have announced to the world on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday the great joy of the Neapolitaus that another Prince of the Bourbons is born into the world. During the night of Saturday heavy patrols of cavalry were stationed throughout the Toledo and the Largo Mercatello. The Royal infant was baptized on Saturday afternoon, in presence of the diplomatic body, and of the various members of the Royal family. Yesterday evening a squadron of cavalry was placed at intervals in the Strada Toledo, amounting to 60 men, and a strong reserve was kept in the Grand Guard, but the public peace was not broken. The inscription above the transparency in the Mlercatello is worthy of notice; it runs thus:-
" DeUa Virgine Immacolata il Patrocinio al re, al regno salda e sperimentata difesa Pd. Giglio che sul talamo reale sorge novello, Napoletani Hleti e confidenti invocate."

THE SPANISH BUDGET.
(moM oa OUR OWN CO1RsPONDhT.)
MADRID, MIARCII 5.
A decree in to-day's Gazdte establishes the Budget for 1857. As I some time ago mentioned, the ex-
nses of the year, *hen they came to be estimated the Council of Ministers, were found so heavy as to cauise great uneasiness on account of the im. p ssibility of meeting them by any ordinary means. With much difficulty they have been somewhat reduced, but it is said that it wiUl ultimately prove that this has only been done by striking out sums set down for ohjects usually considered indispensable. A little time is necessary to ascertain the truth of these statements. Meanwhile, one thing is evident-namely, that the Budget is the heaviest ever yet known in Spain, and that the expenditure is met only by help of the Mires loan
The total amount of expenses, ordinary
and extraordinarys h.... 1.803.300,592 Estimated Receipts.15 ... 62,631,400
Deficiency ... ... ... 2!0,669,192
This difference is to be covered by the discount from salaries and pensions deducted for the months of January and February (abolished from the 1st of March), and by the proceeds of the loan abovementioned, amounting together to 245,000,000 reals. The chief items of increase in the expenditure are 52,000,000 reals (in round numnbers) for the Ministry of War, in consequence of alleged reforms in the army, and, especially, of the increased price of food; 58,000,000 reals obscurely accounted for as increased expense in the collection of taxes, and as the result of different partial reforrns; 26,500,000 reals set down as increase in the interest in the Deferred Three per Cents. and in the home and foreign Consolidated; 14,000,000 reals forthe Royal family, and 17,000,000 reals of arrears remaining due from former Budgets since the year 1850.
The preamble to the decree fills more than five columns of the(Gazettc. The scarcity that has pressed upon the country is put down as one of tho main causes of the augmentation of expenditure, to which it has certainly in some degree contributed. The Minister of Finance points out that the difference between the expenses of an ordinary nature and the income amounts to barely 120,000,000 reals ; and that, if the former can be a little reduced and the latter a little augmented, the much-desired and never-realized financial equilibrium may next year be obtained, to which end the Cabinet reckons on the assistance of the Cortes. This is reaUy a most artless declaration, and supposes not only increase of revenue and diminution of expenses, but also the absence of any of that extraordinary expenditure which this year has so swollen the Budget that the deficiency is only to be met by a loan of 2,500,0001. sterling, contracted on most onerous terms; and these sanguine anticipations are indulged in at the very moment when we have the almost certainty that Spain is about to engage in a distant war, the cost of which, and it can hardly be small, is not included in the Budget. By long experience we know that in Spain the expenditure has a constant tendency to increase, and that no Government has ever yet succeeded in effecting a diminution worth the naming. Within the last 25 years the revenue has doubled itself, but the outlay has not only steadily kept pace with it, but, as Senor Barzanallana intimates in his preamble, has invariably exceeded it. As regards what the Minister is pleased to call " extraordinary" expenditure, we are entirely at his mercy; that is to say, we have no means of checking his assertions as regards most of its item3. A sort of double Budget is made out-one of ordinary, the other of extraordinary expenses. It is impossible to look upon this otherwise than as a convenient fiction, nor should we be justified in believing (notwithstanding the great projects obscurely hinted at, and the high-sounding phrases lavished in the preamble to the decree) that the expenditure for 1858 will shrink within the limits of the 1,682 millions of reals at which Senor Barzanalluna somewhat arbitrarily fixes the " ordinary" expenditure for the present year. A good harvest, of which there is at present a prospect, will do something by diminishing the expense of feeding the army and removing the necessity of affording assistauce to the necessitous classes, but this alone will by no means meet the heavy increase in the charges on the country.
It is as yet too soon to judge of the impression produced on the public by the financial statement for the year. We shall know more on that head to-morrow. The funds have sEghtly risen, but that is attributed to other causes than to satisfaction occasioned by the Budget, which, in fact, there has as yet been insufficient time to study in all its details and fully to appreciate.
The Bank of Spain has lowered its rate of discount to 56 per cent.

MISSIONS TO SEAMEN AFLOAT.-A public meeting
MISSIONrS TO SPA3MEI- AFLOAT.-A public meeting for promoting tbese missions at home and abroad was hold
esterda at Willis's Rooms, under the presidency of the T of ftesbury. The noble chairman, in his address, explained theobjectsof this newly-formed socioty, which was to make provision for the spiritual welfare of our seamen at home, and more especially abroad, there being, from authentic acconnts in the society's possession, 166,286 seamen annualli frequenting foreign ports, and left almost wholly unprovided with Christian instruction when abroad. The society purposed approaching the sailor on his own element, and from ship to ship, and preaching the gospel to him, by means of chaplains and lay agents, whose sphere of aotlon would be the wsndbound shippng in roadste3ds or vessels lying in harbours and docks. The noble chairman had no doubt but that, as seamen, above any other class of men, presented the specialty of being open to religious iXmpressions, the society would be able to carry out its objects and principles If earnest and persevering in its operations. The Earl of Hardwicke approved the society, whichforwarded the welfare of seamen, wbom, from his profession, he nmtnrally regarded with interest. The plan, which was entirely new, resembled a proposal whlch had been made to him last year of vessels being built as floating churches, to sail from port to port for the purpose of administering religious consolation to seamen. The plan was wise, valuable, and feasible, and he hoped to see good rsults spring from it, if it was taken up in proper spirit by the public, and, above all, the captains of ships. Wr . H. Kingston, the hon. secretary, then read a statement of the reasons which had led to the foundation of the society, and the plan laid down for its future operations. The Marquisof Blandford, hLP., moved the first resolution-" That the meeting, fully sensible how httle had been done by the Church of England for the seafaring population, recognized its obligation. to care for the souls of British sauilors, and pledged itself to the most strenuoug exertions to provide them with that spiritual istruction of which they were so much in want.' The noble lord was rejoiced that a society had been, establlshed to supply that most important want,, providing religious instraction to seamen, and, as a member of the church of England, whUe hailing the organization, 'Wished it hearty success. The Rev. Ed ward Bickersteti, rector of Hsmpstd, seconded the resolution, whic2 wa6 supported by Captaaiu Wenhamn. A captain in the E;ast Ini trade testified to the bles3ings and advantages e cap1tains attending to the spiritual welfare of the men in boa3 their ships and the gratitude that was shwn tothem forisby their crews.

JI&S A. GODDARD'S SO1rZES.
bfiss ArabeDa Goddard terminated last night, before a crowded audience, a series of concerts which have presented more than ordinary attraction to connoisseurs. It was not the talent of tho pianist-'who, young as she is, alreidy occupies the highest rank in her profession-that imparted such peculiar interest to these performances, but certain of the last compositions of Beethoven, which constituted a special feature at each of them. All who are acquainted with the biography of the author of Fiddio must be aware that among his many cotributions to the repertory of the pianofortewhich, besides elevating the character of the instrument, and placing it in a position only second to that which by unanimous oonsent belongs to the orchestra, have extorted the unbounded admiration of musicians-there are some few pieces so far beyond the grasp of common intelligence and common manual dexterity as to have exposed them to Tery general,if not entire, neglect. We allude to the solo sonatas produced by Beethoven at a period of his career, when having ong abandoned playing, he gave the reins to his imagination andforgot tostudytheconvenienceofexecutants lgnderthese circumstances he wrote a series of compositions which, though considered by himself superior to whatever had preceded them (as experience has shown, lwith reason} were, for very many years after his death, not only avoided by the mest expert and practised players, but condemned by critics of standing and authority, as rhapsodical in form and mechanically impracticable. The departure of the great musician, however, from the caene of his earthly labours was followed by a sudden and vast increase of renown. As in thc instance of Mo7art, it was found easier to apothoesize him after death than to minister to his necessicies while lving B *uicik degrees the fame of Beetboven reached a pinnacle to which perhaps, the mostardent dreams of his youth and manhood.
ad scarcely ever aspired. Germany christened him " Tonepoet," and enthroned him king of her harmonious children At length it became a grave question whether anything Beethoven had written ought to remain unheard; and, one by one, those works that, except by rare and zealous Irtisans
had been altogether overlooked, wero broughttolight,and at once started in the race for popularity with their more familiar and accommodatin. predecessors. The Ninth Symphony, the Second Miass, and the Posthumous Quartets for stringed. instruments be n to engro3s the attention of the world, and were speedily clnssed so high that the earlier works of Beethoven incurrd, in their turn, the chance of being under Estimated by comparison. Time, aevertheless, has reduced everything to its proper leveL and the last compositions of Beethoven are nOw rated at their just value, wvithout nreju^ dice to those genial inspirations that belong tothe middle and (in respect of absolute invention) perhaps the most fertile epoch of his career. Unlike Mozart and Mendelssohn, Beethoven lived long enough to scatter all the riches of his genius, aud thus to fulfill the mission with which he was intrusted. He died precisely when the mine was well.nigk being exhausted-as Each, and Handel, and Haydn had done before him. The last of the Posthumous Quartets, we think, sufficiently proves that the melodic invention ot Beethoven was on the wane; and (though it may possibly seem to argue a lack of reverence towards one who, in his particular manner, was the grandest and mo,t original of all musicians) we are somewhat inclined to doubt whether his colossal reputation would have been materially augmented by the 10th symphony, vrith its interminablez plan, or the projected music to Goethe's Faust.
The pianoforte sonatas, from Op. 101 to Op. 111, were composed in the brightest period of their author's maturity. True, they are occasionally instinct with a restlessnets, a feverish caprice, a defiance of accepted standards, and X sombreness of character, which plainly manifest thati Beethoven-whose immnediate tone of mind was almost invariably refi,ted in his music-was not exactly on the best terms with the world when he produced them. But this, from a certain point of view, endows the last sonatas with an interest apart, and heightens the attraction derived from their strikine individuality and beauty. At; all eventsd they cannot f il to be ranked, by comuetent judges, with the most exctraordinary of Beethoven's instrumental compositions, and the art is no little indebted to that nece'ssarily small number of Dianstg who have devoted themselves with faith and perseverance to conquer the mechanica1 diffculties they present, and to rescue them from what would otherwise be their inevitable fate-of contributing to the exclusive delight and instruction of students. In England, although the opportunities of hearing the last sonatas well executed are rare, they have probably boen more frequent of recent years tbhn in countnes which lay claim (justly or unjustly) to a more refined musical taste. M1 Charles HA116 and Alexandre Bilet (both classical performers of the highest rank) have played moro than one of tbem in public; and it must be owned that their laudable ambitlon has never gone unrewarded. But the pianist who has most often braved the ordeal of proving to attentivei listeners that the late sonatas were not the offspring of a period when the master was barren, but, on tho contrarY, wealthiest in ideas, and that, in the midst of their striking originality, they aro as clear in design and as symnietrically doveloped as any of his earlier pianoforte works, is Miss Arabella Poddard-the youngest, though by no means the least eminently distinguished rtuosa of the present day. Four years ago Miss (oddard won her first laurels by a masterly performmuce of the most elaborate and difficult of all-Op. 106, in B dat. Since then sho has Played that, and others of t0-
same Tanuly, on several occasions; and lst night she concluded a series of concerts at which the last sonatas of Beethoven have been the prominent features. At the first thero was Op. 109, in E; at the second, Op. 111, in C minor; and at the third, Op. UO, in A flat. Each of these sonatas is a veritable poem ; and the faot of their not offering a point of resemblance to each other, or to anything of Beethoven that precedod them, only tends to establish (if proof were wantmg) the fact of his almost inexhaustible invention. Those acquainted with Miss Goddard's talent, and who have heard her play the Ope. 101 and 106 (for she has performed every one of Beethoven's last sonatas in public) will easily believe that her execution of these remarkable compositions waa worthy of the music (more cannot be said) and excited the utmost enthusiuasm. The one introduced last night-in A flat, Op. 110-difficult as it is, taxes the feeling and sensibility, even more than the manual dexterity of the performer. Miss Goddard, hoWever. in as thorougha mistrets
of oxpression as of execution, and her reading of this wonderfu sonata was such as must have amply satisfied the most fastidious of connoisseurs. Beauties, indeed, unobservedF before, may be said to have been disclosed, especially in the last movements, where the alternation of pathetic edayfio with complex and intricate fuyuc seems to indicate a poeti-
cal intention on the part of Beethoven to sutggetst in fittinF~ music the cons/olation whichxtrue love and earnestpnraitof art are calculated to afford undercircumatanossof the utmost despondency. The whole performance was rewarded b a
plause of the heartiest and most genuine description Bee hoven's design had beenr rendered plain and intellgible i ant the poetical thought which guided him In the oomposition. of his sonata had been tboroughly appreciated.
As at her previous concerts, Miss Goddard varied the programme with contributions from other sources. Two fine works of Mendelssohn- the Air Vari4 for pianoforte and violonoello, with Signor Piatti, and the superb quartet in B minor for piano, violin, viola, and violoncello, in which. bliss Goddard was assisted by Herr Ernst, Mlr. PL Blagrovy, and the violenceUlst already mentioned, were played to perfection. There was some excellent vocal music, by Madame and Mr. Weiss, Mademoiselle Solari (a m'fit Jsopwno both young and promising), and M. Charles Bahab The concert ended, mosit effectively, with & selection from the Pt.-f3 .Feuiitivett of EDrnst and Ste p hen. Belles, for planoforte and violin, performed by iss Goddard ahnd Herr Ernst. The admirable German violinit both in the quartets of Mendelssohn and his own charming pieces.
layed with a depth and variety of espression pec rta
nimself, and elicited the rpturous plandits of the audience. It was his first appoaranco this season. Th vocal music was ably accompanied by Signor Foseh
The success of these soir6cs has been sog-reat that a second series is announced, in the cours of whla three more sonatas-Ops. 101, 106, and I0M-ars to be sitrodueeda Tothe patrons of Miss Goddard, at any rate, the last great works of Beethoven are not likely to remat a sealed book.

jThe following appeared In our second edition of yes. terday:-]
By the arrival of the Mermaid we have received files of papers from Melbourme to the 16th of December Mclusive.
The Royal Charter had arrived out in 66 days.
We take the following from the Mellourne Herald of the 16th of December :
"MELBOURNE GOLD CIRCULAR.
" MELBOURNE, Dnc. 13.
"The price of gold has kept firm, with a rather upward tendency. At the goldfields the competition among the hankers is such that they are paying at present prices close on 2 per cent., while their seling rate for draughts is only 1 per cent. prem. Gold is now 76e. 6d. to 76s. 9d.
" Our report for the week from the various goldfields Is condensed into the following -
" That deserted and deprived-of sub-treasury-Avoca has been resuscitated by parties having struck paying ground, and an old and favourable lead has been sgain hit upon. At Ballarat they were succeeding as well Ma could be desired. At Dunolly new life had been imparted by fresh %Uuvial ground and paying reefs having been discovered. The report from the Ovens Is favourable, both in regard to the production of alluvial and rich quartz reef gold. At rnost of the fields the digging commnunity, while attending to their individual interests, are not forgetful of their social and political condition-the Local Court, sanitary, and other public measures being agitated at different settled diggings.

"The supply has been good, and a good demand has existed, as the opportunities for shipment have been very eligible.
" The escorts have furnished us with a very fair amount of gold this week, and a larger amount than usual has been forwarded from Castlemaine. By the way, we may notice that two more nuggets from Korong have been sold at that field, and have arrived by this escort. They are not so large as those previously found, and weigh respectively 99 ounces and 122 ounces. It is singular to remark that these were found in the same claim as other large ones now at our office,
W We have frequently adverted to the want of escort accommodation from Korong, which entails considerable hard. ship and risk to the lucky digger, who has to carry his gold a distance of 40 miles to market it, and then probably to Castlemaine or Bendigo, where its superior quality is not appreciated. We hope that this will not be the case long, as a fortnightly escort from that place, through Dunolly and Chinamanes Flat, to Maryborough, would be found to be de served by the yield of those fields.
" We have reason to believe that a large emigration vdll take place from California to our fields immediately, as the prospects are anything but encouraging to miners in that country. Upwards of 50 persons arrived from there last week.

Open Or Closed Ports In China?
OPBN OR CLOSED PORTS IN COINKA?
TO THE EDITOR OF TEE TIMES.
Sir,-A paragraph appeared in your Paris correspondent's letter on Friday Lat, on the authority of a private letter from St. Petersburg, to the effect that a column of troops had been despatchel by the Governor of Russian Siberia in the direction of Kiahkta, on the Chinese frontier, in consequence of an agreement with the Court of Pekin. Tho Monitur de la Flotte, two or three days before, gave also a summary of instruetions purporting to be issued by the Emperor of China, closing the five ports on the seaboard, but making a special excep. tion in favour of the overland traffic along the Siberian frontier. Perhaps the connexion between these two notices may not be clear to your readers without a little explanation.
Kiahkta is a Russian settlement of more than a century old, a little to the south of Lake Baikal, and constitntes, with the Chinese frontier town Maimachen (which is in immediate juxtaposition), the emporium through which the whole of the overland tea for Rusda passes. It is by this channel that the article originally reached Western Europe; and if all intercourse with the Chinese seaboard were stopped-as is contemplated in the Imperial instructions above referred to-by this channel only would all consumers, not only in Europe, but in America also, be able to obtain it. The whole teadrinking world would ha ve to content itself with obtaining from St. Petersburg what supplies it could, after every ounce had been brought a distance of nearly 8,000 miles by land transport and river navigation. The cost of transit is such that before the late war scarcely anything was drunk throughout the whole kingdom of Poland but smuggled Canton tea, which was every year penetrating further and further into the interior of Russia, as may be well imagined, when it is stated that the average wholesule price of the common tea was 270 copecks (8s. 10d.) and of the best 410 copecks (13s. 8d.) at Moscow in the year 1854. What it would reach to were the demand suddenly increased to any great extent defies all conjecture. One thing is plain,-that it would deprive not merely the common people, but the great bulk of the middle class, of all participation whatever in the "c cups which cheer but not inebriate."
The duties on this overland tea form an important item in Russian finance. Amost serious diminution in them was occasioned by the treaty with China which threw upon the northern ports. In 1842 no less than 467,679 poods of Chinese merchandise, the far greater part of it being tea, left Kiahkta; in 1854 little more than half as much. If a perfectly free intereourse with the interior of China were allowed the Kiahkta trade would be proportionally diminished; and it is quite conceivable that it would even be superseded altogether, except as regards the so-called " bricktea"-a compost of tealeaves and sheep's blood, in which the Mongul palate exclusively delights. I draw this inference confidently from the positive statement of the Russian statist, M. Tengoborald, that the Kiahkta tea costs 20 copecks the pound in transport, before it even reaches the emporium; whereas the same article from the same dep6t may be taken to Shanghai for only eight copecks, and all the way to London for 10. It is plain, therefore, that the question of open or closed ports in China is the question between the annihilation of the Russian revenue from tea, and the compelling of the consumers of the commodity throughout the world to enrich the Russian Treasury by purchasing a tithe of their requirements at tenfold the price they need pay for an ample supply.
Without any wish to discuss the degree of tact or discretion exhibited in recent transactions, I must say that I think the attempt to open access to the interior of China is a worthy object of any Government having at heart the comfort of the mass of the people. And there is one aspect in which the importance of the question lately brought before the Legislature may be viewed which I have not yet seen adverted to.
The only country which has an interest in sealing the Chinese seaboard is likewise the only one which enjoys, and has long enjoyed, the privilege of being represented at Pekin. Ever since the year 1727 the Russian Government has maintained an establishment in that capita], the members of which are changed regularly every 10 years. It originally professed to be for the spiritual behoof of the descendants of some Siberian settlers -who had been carried off about half-a-century before from the upper valley of the Amoor, but the mission still continues, although the necessity has ceased; and, while authentic information relative to the resources and the administration of the Celestial Em pire is derived through this channel by the Foreignoffice at St. Petersburg, no doubt, whatever opinions are current at Pekin of the Powers of Western Europe owe their shape and colour to the same agency.
If the paragraph to which I have alluded at the beginning of this letter be founded in fact, it seems certain, regard being had to the dates, that it must be through the machinery of this mission that the movement of troops was arranged. The attack on the Bogue Forts took place only on the 20th of October last, and the intelligence would hardly reach Pekin before the middle of November. From Pekin to Kiahkta is at least 1,000 miles over a sandy desert; to Irkutak (which, I suppose, is the seat of the Russian Governor alluded to) some 200 more. From Kiahkta again to St. Petersburg is nearly 5,000 miles. That any communication should have taken place between the latter city and Pekin since the commencement of the troubles at Canton is, therefore, clearly Impossible. The necessary inference seems to be that such a contingency as has arisen was at least foreseen, and instructions given beforehand as to what steps should be taken in the event of its occurrence.
Had the late war continued we should certainly not have been surprised to find mines springing under our feet in every Asiatic Court, and to meet with a Muscovite Brasidas in many an Eastern Chalcidice. That some of the mines should explode too late is, in my judgment, quite as reasonable a theory to account for what has occurred at Canton and at Teheran as the attributing a ruffian policy to any English statesmen, or cruelty, licentiousness, and levity to their agents.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

MR. DENISOK'S LECTURE AT THE ROYAL
X1VSTITUTION.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-I oberved the mistake which Dr. Wylde notices in he report of my lecture, but I dic not think it worth while to trouble you about it, as I knew that every one who heard the lecture and saw the tables exhibited there would perceive that the word " tone" had been acddentally printed for " octave," and that it would be almost equally obvious to everybodywho knows the rudiments of music, without having heard the lecture, as it was to Dr. Wylde.
There was not the least difficulty in understauding how the note of the bell came to be E instead of E flat, when .ts thickness was accidentally increased. The difficulty was to find out how that accident happened, and in that I am afraid Dr. Wylde is not likdy to help us; nor is it at all material now. The only consequence is that the beU costs rather more money and is more powerful; E is just a good a note for the purpose as fldat, and jiu asea Sto nake the quarter bels to suit. Dr. Wylde does not seem to be aware that adding more metal outside a bell will raiae its note as well (though not as much) as adding It inside.
As Iam writing I may as well explain that the apecific avity, mentioned in the report, of the York and Lmcoln sells was that of the old hells of thoee cathedrals, and not the new onea of 1834 and 1845, which is very unlikely to be so good, unless it is extreldy different from other bellmetal which I have examined Srom the eamo foundz7, and

with the Englishl Mint p rce of 31. 17s. 1IOjd. per ounce for standard gold, it appears that gold is nearly 3-lOths per cent, dearer in Parls Hmuan. London.
By advices from Hamburg the price of gold is 424 per mark, and the short exchange on Eondon is 134a per 11. sterlinag. Standard gold at the Englsh Mint price is therefore rather more than 1-10th per cent. dearer in Loone thanin f gaebur ter
The course of exchange at New York on IL,don for bills at 60 days' sight is 108A per cent., which
when compared with the Mint par between the tr o conltries, shows that the exchange is against England; but, after making allowance for charges of transport and difference of interest, the present rate leaves no profit on the transmission of gold either way bett een England and America.
The English funds remain without recovery. Consols for money, which left off yesterday at 9
were first quoted 93 to . A slight denmand for stock on the part of the public then caused a recovery to 93o, but it was not maintained, and the final prices were again 93m to i for money and 93. to B for the 8th of April. The transactions of the day wera unimportant, and there was no alteration inGtha rates for money either in the Stock-Exchange or the discount-market. Bank Stock, the transfer books of which will close to morron, left off at 220 to 222; Exchequer-bonds, 98. to 9 ; India Bonds, 4s. discount to par; and Exchequer-bills, par to 3s. premium.
Forein n eecurities were steady, but the market was lessefrm towr the close. InTurkish Six per Cents. transactions for the account took place at 96r and 97. The bargains in the Four per vents Guaranteed were at 1m01n and i.

In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates generally were rather less firm.
The final quotations of the French Three per Cents, on the Paris Bourse this evening wepre 70f. 0sc. for money anmd 71f. 1c. for the end of the month, showing a reaction of a quarter per cent.
The Mermaid, from Australia, has arrived with 41,892 ounces of gold and 50,000 sovereigns, making a total of 217,5001. The whole of this will be purchased at once for transmission to the Continent. The Blackwvall is due, with 320,0001., and the Admiral, with about 160,0001. The Derwent, also, is stated to have cleared on the 16th of December, with 65,0001.
The advices from Australia by the Mermaid reach to the 16th of December, and are a fortnight later than those previously received. They bring favourable accounts of the appearance of the market for imported goods, news having been brought by the Royal Charter that the shipments from this side had latterly not been excessive. The movement in favour of a uniform tariff for all the Australian colonies continued, and it was thought probable that an arrangement might be effected during the p resent year. The Colonial Treasurer had made his financial statement, howing a surplus revenue of 85,0001. for the year 1857, owing to large reductions in the Governmnent estabslauneuts. The expenditure, which was estimated at 3,300,0001., included 1,157,3901 for public works and 281,0001. for immigration. It was alleged that the Government contemplated the eetablishment of a public bank of issue, but the details had not transpired. It had been intimated, also, that they intended to authorize a number of debenture loans for constructing railways. The total receipts of gold by escort for the three months from the 6th of September to the 6th of December had been 2,620,6521., being an increase of 2,8761. on the corresponding period of 1855. Among the vessels appointed to sai were-the Orwell, on the 23d of December; the Austral, on the 25th of December; the Copenhagen, on the 10th of January; the George Marshall, on the 24th; and the Ireue, during the same month-all for London. The White Star was to leave for Liverpool on the 27th of December, and the Royal Charter in January.

"Sir,-Daring the debaLte on the Budget last Friday a mnember, in oppogition to the Govemrnent, thought proper to read.twolatters wxitte,ibythe Secrtaryof tboBoard of Customs, in.reply to questions put as to-whether the extra war duties imposed on tea and sugar would be continued longer than the 5th day of April followi'ng. I
"Now, as the law then sto~od, and as it amstltands, it was hardl noeeary to have asked any such questioni at all;ad eBadwould therefore have beea perfectly justified in simplyreferrng to the law itself. The wording of the A|t m those extra duties is clear enough. It is there staedtha tose duties sha1l he paid 'until the 5th day of April includive which all farst happen after the end of lmonuths from the date of a definitive treaty of peace with Russia.'
"Nothing can be plainer than this; and, as every one who was paying any attention to the course of events must have known that a ' definitive' treaLty of peace was concluded and signed with Russia onl the 31st of March, 1850, the extra tea and sugar dutyes would oease on the 5th of April, 18i. The fact of that definitive treaty havingbeen concludled was published in the London Gaeteon e s of Aprifl, 1856, and it was subsequently announced in an Order in Council, where It is also referred to in the same manner.
"1Under thoge circumstances the Board of Customs could give no other answers than those which they gave to the enteme wh appiedto hemforinformation on the subect Itwasqute nneessry orthe Cominsinsoners to aplyto he Teasry n th materfor their Lordshlp coud oly efe thm t th la; teytherefore state

"It must be remembered that tho Act imposing those duties is not the same as that under which the income-tax is levied. There the case is altogether different. As we have already seen, the tea and sugar duties are only inposed till 12 months after aL " definitive' treaty of ace, and which was conclutded and signed on the 31st of March, 1850 But in the case of the income-tax it was imposed ' until the 5th of April which shall first happen after the end of 1.2 months from the dateo of the ratifica;tion of a treaty of peace with Rusa la' and as this did not occurtr
long aLfter the definitive treaty was concluded and sigped, and, consequently, after the 5th of Apr-fl, 1856, the extra tax would continue tDil April, 185. The propostion of the Government therefore is simply this-that the income-tax shall be reduced 12 months earli'er than the period fixed b law an tat heteaan suardutesshall be continug

There was an improved tone in the cloth-market, and more business is reported to have been done in all descrip. tions of fabrics for export, except domestics, which coutinue flat. The principal portion of this bu-iness has been in low qualities of shirtings, jaconots, Madapollams, and T-cloths, suited to the Bombay trade, the orders be' Intended to cover the large sales reported as havingz Len made at Bombay at the date of last advices. Buyers have purchased rather freely under these circumstances at last prices, but where sellers, as in some Instances has been the case, have held for higher prices, business has been checked. There has been rather more demand for printers and longclotbs at full prices. For yams sellers have been asking tiL per lb. advance, which has rather checked business. at last week's rates a large business would have been done. The market, however, is exceedingly firm spinners having relieved themselves considerably of stocks by the oxtra sales of last week. " For China," Messrs. John Fender and Co.

NOTTINGHAM, MARCH 10.
The lace trade is a shade improved. The season, however, is alate one, inasmuch as at this period of the year manufacturers are usually very busy. There are some foreign orders in the market, and goods are being produced for home consumption. For coarse plain articles there continues a good demand, and the prices which these goods obtain is enormous. The operatives connected with tho lace branch are exceedingly well employed. There is not much doing as yet in silk lace, in consequence of the dearness of the materid.
In hosiery there is a good business doing. Orders are in course of completion for the American market, and there is a fair demand for goods for home consumption. Stocks are, however, kept down, our manufacturers, for the most part, being averse to snaking more than is required at the present time.

The attendance of buyers hs been small, and the transactions have been,within a very moderate compass. The closeness of the general election, no doubt, contributes to produce this temporary suspension of activity, and it is also partially occasioned by the state of the vwool-market and in consequence of the stocks iu the halls being very much reduced, Orders are nevertheless not sO numerous or extensive as they have latterly been, but there does not appear to be any reason for apprehension as to the stability of the trade or its prospects during the ensuing spring and summer months,

he all-eary metin of this conipany was held yesterdayXat the London Tavern, Mr. S. Bird in the chair.
r.TUEQPJA2,D, the seerets,ri, 'read thae report, which stated that the direotors had been.in personal cornelunnication with the committee appointed by theo sharehiolders and their isolicitor upon the subject of PEr. Hawkshaw's award %nd the division of the funds in hand. The committee had stated to the directos that acting upon the opinione of counsel, they entirely disputea the validity of that award, and thty had given notice to the directors not to receive any further paYment from the Lon and by Nrth-Wrestern Railway Company in respect to the award, anid meot to take any step that coaud interfere with or prejodice the right of the ordinary shareholrers to impeach the award ; and further, not to make any distribution of the funds in hand. Acting upon this notice, the directors returned to tle London and NoRTth-Western Company the check for s491. owhich had been received from that comtany for the half-year's rent to the 31st of December last. T-he directors expreJtsed their regret at the prospect of furthbr litigation, but they felt that in their positiodn
trusees for the various classes of shareholders in tlhis coinpany they ought not to conclude the rights of any class, withidut an opportunity having been afforded for discussing such 'rihts. Tbe traffio on the Kensington Canail showved a decrease in the total tonnage, as compared with the last haly-tear, of 1,444 tons, but an increase in the tolls of 981. There was on increase in the traffic both to and from the raTlway-in the former of 394 tons, and inm the latter of 7,26r3o tons., The capital account showed that 227,0691. had been received, and 224,7271. expended, leaving a balance of 2,3411. The revenue accoun, froim the 30th of June, 1849, to the 31st of December, 1856, showed that 14,3uas. had beens eceived, and 6,7971. expended, leaving a balance of 7,5401. The receipts fror the past half-year amounted to 8611. -and the expenses to 1941., leaving a suLrplus of 6671.

The half-yearly meeting of this company was held yester. day at the London Tavern; Ma Rh Bwrce in the ehair.
The report, an abstract of which has appeared [in 77hc sto was taken as read.
The CrnAnCLou, in moving the adoption of tie report, adverted to the general and progressive increase of the traffic. It had increased during the last four years at the
rate of from 10 to 12t per ceno. per annumn. This was very satisfactory, as it had arisen chiefly from iiew sources of business. The traffic from the port of Lynn had diffased itself over a larger area, than it occupied four years a-go, and they now sent goods to market that were not known in their list before. The capabilithies of Lynn for trade bad been progrewsively improving, ad, in order to mnore fully develope it, the company sad, axt considerable ex3ense, laid down tramways alon the quays, and the result had given them the most decidne evidence of the utility of that very dewirable expenditure. Itawas gratifying to perceive that the people of Lynn now spoke with some confidence as to the increase of traffic to the port, arising from the completion of the estuary werks and the continuatien of the railway to the quays of Lynn. It was a most des'i
rable port for landing seeds and other articles from the continent. The item of working expenses in the Eastern Counties reports were now very heavy, although at one tinie they did not exceed 41Al per cent. He believed if the lineand plant had been maint-3,ec in an efficient state that the working expenses would have been considerably lower at tho
present time than they were, and in consequenc of the working arrangement the East Anglian would not only be in the receipt of dividends on the reference shares, hut these would he something to diviae among the ordinary shareholders. They could only look forward to the future for that result. The imsmense district of the Eastern Counties Railway, as long as there were mouths to eat and stomachs to fill, must be a great trading and producing country. The great antidote to the worflng expenses on the Eastern Counties lines was the alteration of rates charged for carrying goods and commodities. Those rates had been kept at var unremunerative amounts for some purpose or other, to the injury of the Eastern Counties proprietors, aid bad tended greatly to itnrease the working expenses. He hoped they had seen an end of that state of thinuO, as the present board would not countenaLnce any. thing of the kiid.e hey would not charge only 61. where they could get 101. for the same work; by that means they would bring down the working expenses from 66 per cent. to about 40 per cent. They had sesi told if they raised thei rtes they would lose the traffic, but it was not found to be the case, the special rates charged to particular persons only ecmouragedmxonopoly, and gave those persons larger profits, at the expense of the public and shareholders.
here free competition existed the public were better served, and the articles supplied were of better quality.
Ih repgd to plantion their line, he was glad to say that rithae ery faats sup pliedrduring the half-year, and had resulte in increased traffic. The working expenses paid to the Eastern Counties Company were h0 per cent., and exceeded 13,0001. during the ha-year sit was therefore clear that any inereas in the receipts for traffic would Increase the amount of expenses paid to that company. The chief amount of traffic on the East Anglian pissed over 26 mles of it, and it was also conveyed frone l0 to 72 miles over the Eastern Counties line so that any increase of the East Anglian traffic brought twice or three times that amount over the Eastern Counties Railway. The interests of the two companies were identical, and he trusted they would never again have to complain of those grievances to which he had formerly called their attention. The Increase of the trade of Lynn mnust benefit the Easter iCounties. The manufacture of oil fromiseeds had lately been commenced there, and he was glad to say the company had reserved very eligible pieces of land for sites of factories or other commercial undertakings, which they would disasee of on reasonable terms, with a view to encourage the increase of trade atLynn. The proposed line to Hunstantonr if carried out, would increase their traffic very consideraly, and would not cost much money to constructit. With regard to the proposediamalgamationrof all the lines in the EasterlCounties, drit, which they were hound to arply for in the session of 1862, it would be necessary t at their interests should be attended to because they had rights under the deed of settlement, anralsO by Act of Parliament. They only wanted fair play and justice, and the directors felt that if that was accorded to them the East Anglian would occupy a favourable position in the amalgamation.
Mr. L. SLsirson seconded the mnotion.
In reply to questions it was stated that the special agreements for rates would terminate in July next. TXhe great difficulty inx opening the trade on the railway was for traders to get mercantile situations for the sale of coal &c. The repairs and renewals on the Eastern Counties had amaounted to 72,0001., or 7d. per mile, and so long as those 14hevy chariges continued, the working expenscs would be
hgh It as proposed to put 112,0001. up to a suspense account, but lie and Ihis colleagues would not be parties to a suspense account. So long as the expenses of each half-year were p aid out of the revenue, they could not complain, but they hiad no right to bear any portion of the suspense ac. count.
Mr. Lv AP,&T thought it would he desirable if they would state the capital account so as to be more easily understood. He was glad they intended to hiave nothing to do with a susqense account, as such accounts were generally of a most insidious and delusive character, and were generaly intended to be charged to capital. He congratulated his brotlier shareholders on the improved position of affairs.
Resolutions -were passed adopting the report ; declaring a dividlend at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum onx the B stock, and at the rate of 4i1 per cant, per annum on the C stock, authorizing the directors to consolidate the A shares, 21. paid, Into a 7 per cent, stockc, being subject to no further

TRBE PUBLIC FEA LTH.
(From the Registrar-General's Weekly Return.)
Tho deaths registered in London, which in the first week of February rose to 1,368, have continuously decreased since that time, and in the week that ended last Saturday were 1,175. In the 10 years 1817-56 the average number of deaths in the weeks coresponding with last week was 1,160. For the purpose of comparison this average must be raised proportionally to increase of population; in which case it will become 1,276, and it will appear that the pu'blic health is at present so far good that the deaths last -eek were les5 by 100 than the number that would have occurred if the average rate of mortality had ruled.
The mortality from diseases of the zymotic order was last week unusually low, for the deaths referred to these did notexceedl7l, while the corrected average for corresponding weeks is 244. Smallpox was fatal in only two cases, both of which were those of young children and occurred in Clerkenwell; and it may be stated that London enjoyed almost complete immunity from this distemper or from its fatal attaoks. Whether it be the result of causes that are temporary in their operation or otherwise, it is probable considering the greatly increased population, that smallpox has neverbeen less prevalent, or more subdued in its character, than at the present time. Measles ia the previous six weeks averaged 27 deaths weekly; the number fell last week to 10. Twenty-two children died of scarlatina, a numler which shows a decrease also in this complaint. The deaths from typhus declined to 26, and those from diarrhcea to 12. The most fatal complaint in tbe zymotic class was whooping-cough, which carried off 70 children. The deaths caused by diseases of the organs of respiration, wvhich in the previous week were 304, declined last week to 262, of which 136 were from bronchitis, and 100 from pneumonia. Two deaths are recorded as caused by privation, two by intemperance. Six persons are retu-ned who had attained the age of 90 or more years, and in this number is a pensioner in the Royal Hfospital at Chelsea, whose age is stated to have been 100 years.
Last week the births of 970 boys and 88 girls, in all 1,858 children, were registered in London. In the 10 correspondingueeks of the years 1847-56 the average number was
At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height of the barometer in the week was 30-122in. The mean reading of this instrument was above 30in. daily during the last 10 days of February and the first five of the present month. The highest reading last week was 30-43im. and occurred on Sunday, the 1st inst. The mean temperature of the week was 43.10, and was 2.90 above the average of the same week in 43 years (as determined by Mr. Glaishier). The highest temperature in the week occurred on Sunday, and was 55°; the lowest occurred on Thursday, and was 29 5,. The range of the week was therefore was 25.5. The mean dew-point temperature was 37.90, and the difference between this and the mean temperature of the air was 5.20. Theowind which blew on the first two days from the east was afterwards generally in the west. There was no aupreciable amount of rain. The horizontal movement of the air vared from 10 miles a-day to 150.

Their LORDSHIPS agreed with the Master of the Rolls upon the main point in dispute, and, by consent of the parties, ordered certain accounts to be taken, and, in fact, dismissed the appeal, and varied the decree by directing those accounts to be taken.

(Wetor= Yice.1Cancllor Sir R. T. RmiD9S Lar.
Ihis suit was instituted to recover personal property to the amount of about 70,000L, claimed by the plaintiff as the personal representative of Isabel Cook, who claimed to be the next of kin of Frances Mary Shard, and the suit was against the Solicitor of the Treasiry, the Crown having taken possession of the property. The facts were these :- Frances Mary Shard died on the 15th of May, 1819, intestate, and administration to her estate was granted on the 19th of April, 1820, to George Maule, the then Solicitor to the Treasury, as the nominee of Her Majesty. George Maule died in November, 1851, and the defendant succeeded to his office, and under the 15th and 16th of Victoria au estates vested as administrator in Maule became vested in the defenidaut. Isabel Cook was the wife of Ellis Cook, of Hanover, Morris County, United States, America, and was the cousin german (as was alleged) of the intestate Frances Mary Shard, and at the time of her death her next of kin. A uit of ' Rscherford v. Maule" was instituted in the Prerogative Court, and it was stated in that suit that Frances Mary Shard was the lawful daughter of Robert Rutherford, of Trenton, New Jersey, United States, and Margaret, his wife, born in 1764, and when 15 years old came to Europe, and married William Shard; that there was no issue of that marriage, and William Shard died in 1806, leaving his widow, who died on the 15th of May 1819, never having married again. Robert Rutherford, the father of the intestate, in 1700 married Margaret in ng. land, where his eldest daughter Margaret was born ; and Robert Rutherford and his wife died in the lifetime of the intestate. and.had issue aix children-viz., Margaret, Sarah, Nancy, Frances Mary (the intestate), Webb, and Elizabeth, and they all died in the lifetime of the intestate sine proleIt was then stated that the plaintiff had been informed by Columbus Smith, of West Salisbury, Vermont, United States, attorney of James Cook, one of the children of Isabel Cook, that Sarah Martha Rutherford, sister of intestate's father, in 1743 married George Davis, and died in the Intestate's lifetime; that she had five children-Margaret who married one Butts, Thomas, James, Sarah, and Is
wife of Ellis Cook. Margaret Butts, Thomas DavsJae Davis, and Sarah Davis all died in the lifetime of the intestate without issue. Isabel Cook survived her cousin, the intestate, and died intestate in 1828 at Hanover, United Stat in her husband's life time. Ellis Cook died in 1830 intesta
and without having administered to Isabel his wife'esa' but on the 23d of July, 1855, letters of administaton
her estate were taken out by the plaintiff for the use and benefit of James Cook, now living at Vermont, in North America, one of tho cbildren of Ellis Cook and Isabel his wife. The usual administration order was made in his Honour's chambers on the 8th of November, 1855, and an inquiry was directed asto who were the next of kin of the intestate, hving at the time of her death, and -whether any of them were since dead; and, if dead, who was or were their legal personal representatives. Several parties had received various sums at various times, am ounting to many thousand pounds, and, among the rest, Mrs. Colonel Gubbins and William Lee, aonounting to 2,0001. and 4,5001. respectively, at the same time being required to give and wiving bonds, in case of further claims being made. A Mi-s hard was alleged to be the nearestrelative to the intestate, and in 1831 a person calling himself John Rutherford put in a further claim as next of kin, and in another suit a will was set up, ard 36 witnesses gave evidence, and the two cases were heatd before Sir John Nichol, who decided against the Claims. In 1850 Columbus Smith called on Mr. Lee, in Bath (where the intestate had resided), but this application was not attended to, and after the lapse of seven years the plaintiff had brought forward Iis claim as above. A vast mass of evidence was brought forward, which, on behalf of the plaintiff, it was contended proved clearly such a degree of relationshin as was sufficient to establish the claim, and the Courts could take into consideration what had already been proved on other occasions. A portion of the information brought forward rested upon a correspondence passing between the intestate and other parties, particularly a Mr. Bowinr and Mrs. Butts, in which she gave an account of herMNITly, referring to disputes between her father and nncle, the former having settled at Trenton, and kept an inn, caUed the Black Horse Imn, and making every inquiry respecting the family; and the Revolutionary War was referred to as fixing certain dates. The Crown opposed the claim, although being merely in the position of stakeholders, on the ground tat it was not proved, and was in fact nothir
more than the former claim in a new shape, and althougg all the parties might speak sincerely, believing what they said to be true, still the statements were too vague to found anything like proof upon. The matter was now arched upon an adjourned summons.
for.t v, Sir F. Thesiger, and Mr. Sheffield appeared for the lamtff; the Attorney-General and Mr. Wickens apeeape for the Crown.
ir F. THESIGER was heard in reply.
The Vicm-CHNCELrOR said that before he gave any opilon upon this case (not that he had not formed one to some .snt) he must be furnished with all the documents in this sat, and also in the proceedingas in the Ecclesiastical Court, and al other materials necessary to found his judgment upon.
IN 555 TRE PBOTESTXT A5SIJ1ANCE ASSOCIATIONi.
Tis matterncomes on on an an adjourned summons from chambers, the question being whether Mr. Letts, formerly of the firm of Letts, Son, and Steer, stationers was a con tributory to this company, sshich was in corse of winding up. The official manager's case against him w as that tho
finr had taken 10 shares ini this company that Mr. Steer had executed the deed of settlement in the name of the firm, 'Letts, Son, and Steer," and on the dissolution of the pa tneship those shares had been handed over to Letts as part of his share of the partnership assets; and that, moreover, he had received dividends upon the shares. Mr. Letfr
contended that he was not a legal shareholder, inasmuch as MIr. Steer had exected the deed alone, and wvithout his actual knowvledge, and he only knew that the shares wrere
taen, and that there was an agreement betwveen them that
recetved merely as a portion of the partnership noetso and Steer himself executed the deed on the faith of being told by the secretary of the company that the liability was limited. r. Steer had also access to the deed,
Mr. Baily and Mr. Erakine appeared for the offiCal manager; Mr. Cains, Mr. Hannen (of the common law barl, and
lr. Giffard appeared Lfor Mr. Letts; Mr. Glasse and Mr. enyon for hMr. Steer.
Khe Vcx-CANcuLLoR (without hearing counsel for Mr. Steer or for the official manager in reply) said that it was reasonable enough that Mr. Letts should seek to escape liability, but that in so doing he should seek to throw it upon Mr. Steer surprised him not a little, but he was not called upon to decide upon the honour and probity of the case, but upon the application of those principles which governed these cases. Whatever question might ariso whether the company had a right to make Letts and Steer hable together, Letts, at all events, was personally Hable, whether Steer was so secondarily or not, the company being content that he should be so liable. His Honour then referred to the facts, observing that the secretary was partly correct in his representation-namely, as to the policies, and might not have intended to deceive, and Steer told it to Letts in its nalced truth. The shares were taken in such a manner that each one judged for himself, and the shares were taken and dividends received, and both as to paymnents and receipts it -was a partnership transaction. No doubt one partner could not bmd another in a matter not relating to the partnership, except by special agreement; but here it did relate to the partnership, and there was a specal agreement to take the shares. Another general proposition was, that one partner by executing a deed could not bind his partner without express assent by him. His Honour would asslmne that Letts had a right to say he was not bound by the deed, and that the execution alone made parties sbareholders. Suppose it was not -executed, and a party took shares and his name was registered and dividends received, could there be a doubt that he was a shareholder ? Letts and Steer were shareholders in this concern. What, then, was the effect of Steer's executing the deed, asmming that it was inoperative against Letts? It was a contract between the company and the fim, but it was said that Steer only was legally liable;- he (the Vice-Chancellor) could not assent to that
sition. The effect of the transaction was to make the
firm hable as sharehoilderts anadietts as a m m tebr of the firm, and both together as tenants in common, as contributories joinitly. But the partnership was dis-solved and all assts and liabilities transfered to Letts, and the coipan miht ay,1"We don't care about the transfer,"1 but bengwilingtohold Ietts liable in the firtd, and St-eer in te seond egre, I didnoteie nthmouth of Letts to say that Steer should be lable and not himself - that was

James Devine and Thomas Wilson were indicted for having stolen a watch, value 31. 18s., the property of John Gutlabert, from his person.
Mr. Caarteen prosecuted; Mr. Tindal Atkinson appeared for the prisoners.
The prosecutor (a German) stated that he was a tailor, living mn Cooper's-gardens, Shoreditch, and on the evening of the 14th of February he was in company with the pn. soners drinking. They went from a house in Brick-lane to a beershoncalled the Britannia, in Willow-walk, where they played at cards for some time; two others joined them and also played, and after some time the prisoners and he left. Devine took his watch from his pocket and said he should keep it until they got to the railway-station. They draggd and pulled him about a good deal, and said he should have it back again for 31 When they got to the station a policeman took them in charge.
James Stelfox stated that he was a cabinetmaker, living at 75, Leonard-street. On the evening of the 14th inst., about half-past 8 o'clock, he was passing aloW ow-walk when he saw the prisoners homg t-hc p lroselowr by th arms. The prosecutor was drunk. He told them to let the man alone, when Devine, in reply, told him to trouble his head with his own concerns and not other people's, and go about his business. He saw Wilson take the prosecutor's watch and pass it to Devine. The prosecutor was wrong in sayingitwas.Devinewho took it. Afterhehadinterfered they draed hin into another publichouse; he followed them in and having told the landlady what he had seen them do she said he would not allow such people in her house. They then left, and he followed them into Willow-street, where he saw a policeman, and told him what he had witnessed. The Xoliceman went and took them into custody. They were supporting the prosecutor, one on each side. Witness saw Devine tike the watch from his pocket and try to force it into the prosecutor's pocket, but he could not, and he then passed it to witness behind the policeman's back, motioning to him to run off with it. He at once handhed it over tothe policeman, and the prisoners were taken in charge.
The poiiceman, 166 G, corroborated the latter part of the last witnes's evidence.
The prosecutor denied that he staked his watch on the game at cards, or that he gave it to Vilson on condition that he was to receive it back on payment of 31

The traverse jury said they intended to make a similar recommendation.
The ASSrsTANT-JUDGE said he should act upon it, and ordered a reward of 21 to this witness.
The prisoners were each sentenced to four years' penal servitude.
William Baker, 24, and Thomas Chantresw, 20, were indicted for stealin~ watchL and chain, valueo 5L, the property of William Vakeling, in his dwellinghouse.
Mr. Iangford appeared for the prosecution, Mr. Sleigh for the prisoncrs.
On the 16th of Febraary two persons, the prisoners now charged, according to the evidence called at a house occunied by the irosecutor at Hackney when one of them said he had accidentaly knocked a crici-et-baU over the garden wall in the rear, nd asked as a favour that he might be permitted to go and look for It. Mrs. Wakeling went into the garden with one of them to look for the ball, which, however, was not to be found, and during their absence the other, who was left in the passage, went into the parlour and stole a watch from the mantelpiece.
Ehe defence was that there was a mistake as to the identity of the prisoners, and evidence was iven to nrove an albi. It appeared that Baker was a working jeweler, and hadrecently come from Northampton to rocure emloy. ment. He had been lodgig at 81, Mansfeld-street, iEngsland-road, and the other prisoner was son of a watch and clockmaker, 6, them-plbot Warner-place, Hackney-road.
The jury found thmbt Guitiy, and they were sentenced to four yars' Penal servitude.

The prosecutris, the wife of a journeyman carpenter, stated that on the previous evening, abont 8 o'clock, she was passing along the Old Kent-road when her attention was attracted to a shop window. At that time her purse, containing lOs. 4d., was safe in the pocket of her dress. While standing at the window she was surrounded by several young lads, who conimenced pushing her about. On endeavouring to get out of their way she felt some one pulling herdress, and on lookingroundshe dis'inctly saw the prisoner withdraw his hand from her pocket, when he ran away. On missing her purse and contents she pursued him and caught Lim by the collar, at the same time demanding tbe restoration of her money. He said he know nothingol the money and struggled hard to get away, but being positive that he had picked her pocket sho Icept hold of him until a constable came up, when she gave bin into custody. A number of peoplo surrounded them, but not one assisted her in securing the prisoner; 5s. out of the lOs. 4d. was handed to her by some one, but she lost the remainder.

The prosecutrix told him the prisoner had robbed her of her purse containing lOs. 4d, As soon as witness secured him one of the crowd picked up 5s. and handed them to the prosecutrix. He searched the prisoner, but found nothing c n him.
The prisoner, after some hesitation, pleaded "Guilty," hopig tis w orship would deal leniently with him.

From the statement of Mr. Harris it appeared that for the two preceding days Mrs. Bacon had been confined to her bed, and symptoms of fever had presented themselves; and that he could not hold himself responsible for the consequence of her being brought to the court on the following day, and undergoing the excitement of a lengthened public investigation. It was finally arranged that the examination should be adjounred for another week, and Inspector Younug wvas sent for, and requested to countermand the attendance of the witnessesupwa rds of 30-for this day, and to tell them to be p resent on the Wednesday following, unless they received some instructions to the contrary.

Thesiger wlll attend for the defendant on a special retainer, vhile a learned counsel of the equity bar, Mr. Lake Russell, will appear on a special retainer for the plaintifl,
CROWN COURT.-B?efore the CFE BARoN.)
George Jordan, aged 22, was indicted for feloniously wounding and shootng at Joseph Blandy on the 26th of January lt, with a f5onious inten t.
M1r. Wroth was connsel for the prosecution; Mr. Metoalfe defended the prisoner.
It appeared that the prosecutor, a lad of 15, was engaged in the sport of snowballing with other youths, and among them the prisoner, who after a while went into his house, and presently returned with a gun, which he discharged some of its oontents slightly wounding the proeecutor ana two ethers. All the boys who were examined to-day agreed in saying that they thought the gun went off by accident.
The defence was, that the prisoner being lame, stumbled, and that the gun did go off by accident.
The CnTxT BARO2, having left it to the jury to say whether they adopted this view of the case or attributed the discharge of the gum to design, they at once returned a verdict of NVot Guily.
William Morris, aged 49, was indicted for maliciously wounding Thomas Linnell with intent to do some grievous bodily harm.
Mr. Daent was counsel for the prosecution, and Mr. Payne defended the prisoner
It appeared that the prorecutor and the prisoner were both employed at the Wolverton station as smiths on the 5th of July last, and that the prisoner having fIung some coke near the proseeutor the latter took up one of the pieces and flung it at the prisoner by way of returning what he ,considered to be a joke. Unfortunately the coke struck the eye aud nose of the prisoner, who was thereby greatly pained. Some friends came up to him and extracted the dust, an operation which lasted 10 or 15 minutes. At the expiration of that period the prisoner took up a long pointed iron, used as a poker at the forge, and pluning it into the embers told his mate to turn the blast on. In less than two minutes the poker grew to a white heat, and the prisoner, seizing it, ran up to the proseenter, w^ho endeavoured to make his escape round a boiler. In so doing he placed his lett hand on the boiler, when the prisoner struck the poker inato the hand and inflicted such injury as led to the total loss of that limb. After the blow had been struck the prisoner threw the poker into the trough of water to cool, and excli
" that he would not have done it for 201.,") expressed= ra
sorrow, offering to allow the prosecutor 3s. or 4s. a-week out of his wages tMil he was well.
The CnF BARON, in sunming up the case, left it to the juty to say whether the wound had been inflicted with any felonious intent, and if not directed them to find the pci. soner gulty of unlawful wounding simply.
The Jury, fter a short deliberation, Acqutitted th psi. rsoner of the felonious intent, and found him G-iltyof unlawful wounding.
Sentence-12 months' imprisonment.
Willam Ginger, aged 21, and William Dukes, aged 18, were indicted for stealing 12 branches of a holly-tree, grow. ing in the pleasure-ground belonging to Hartwell-honse. the residence of Dr. Lee, the said branches being worth more than Uf., on the 16th of December last. A second count charged the prisoners with damaging the said tree to the extent of more than 11.
Mr. Stephenson appeared for the prosecution; Mr. IL Mills defended the prisoners.
The gardener of Dr. Lee proved that the tree in quAestion was au old and very handsome variegated holly, which was ereatly prized by Dr. Lee. It grew up nearly 20 feet high, mn four stems, and was perfect on the 16th of December, on which day the two prisoners were seen walking in a parish roadelose to thepleasure garden. On the 22dit was discovered that many of the upperbranches had been rudely torn off, and the tree entirely spoilt. The gardener, suspecting that he should find some of his tree in Aylesbury Christmas market went there, and at two stalls he saw some branches which he recognized, and eventually identified by matching them with the broken stumps. Both the persons in whose possession these branches were so found stated, and now sroved, that they had bought them from the two prisoners. Itfurther appeared that the pleasure ground in which the tree grew was separated from the house and garden by the road in which the prisoners were seen, and that it was connected with the garden by a tunnel under the road.
Mr. MiLLS submitted that the case was not within the Act, as the ground was separated from the house and its garden by a public road.
The COFiAre BARON having overruled the objection, as the existence of the tunnel showed that the ground in question was occu ed with the house, and brought it within the Words "elongaing to the house," as laid in the indictment
The jury found both the prisoners Gluilty, whereupon they were both sentenced to imprisonment for one month, the learned and amiable prosecutor having recommended them to mercy.
ALLEGED 3IURDER.
Maria Isabella Becket, aged 66, was indicted for the 'wilful murder of Jane Bowden, on the 30th of December last,
Mr. Wroth was counsel for the prosecution; Mr. Power and Mr. Mlls appeared for the prisoner.
The prisoner is a respectable-looking old lady, who at the time o tbe occurrence out of which this charge arose was lodging at Wing with her son-in-law, Mr. Bowden. Near to their house lived Mrs. Becket, the wife of the
irisoner's son, and it appeared that on the 30th of ecember the old lady paid the latter a morning call. mr. Becket welcomed her relative warmly, saying, " Oh, snother, you have not been here since the alterations." To this the prisoner, whose eyes glared wildly, replied with a sad and solemn voice, " Yes, I am come, but not on a pleasant errrand, for I am come to kill you. I must do it for I am mad," and muttered something about her having been sent by the devil, who had given her a razor - at the sane time she produced a razor from her pocket, aud zeized him. Becket's arm. A scream and struggle ensued, -during whlih the old lady said, " Oh ! I must do it ;" but a second scream summoned to the aid of Mrs. Beoket, who was far advanced in pregnancy, a neighbour, and by his asststoe the maniac was subdued and apparently ,pacified. After a while she said she was better, and went away, saying she could go alone. Although M3rs. 3eeket had observed indications of a failing intellect in her mother-in-law since her husband's death two years ago, neither she nor her friend accompanied the prisoner. On her retarn horme she found the -deceased, a child only 10 weeks old, sleeping in a cradle =ckea by an -elder sister five years old. Mr Bowden was uPstairs, anduimmediately after the returnf of the prisonter obe heard a shriek from the girl, and on rushing down discovered to her.horror the old lady, with the babe on haer hlap., deliberatel engaged in the act of euLttiaig its throat 'with a knife.he indies thus inflted onthe child caused its death in a few. minutes, as her distracted mother ruhed -out of the house with it in her arms.

George Crier was indicted for stealing the half of a 51.- note, the property of Abraham Cox, at windon.
Mr. Hloges was counsel for the prosecution.
This was rather a curious case. It appeared that Cox sent the helf of a 56-note to Messrs. Cooper, of Bristol; that was received and acknowledged. Cox then sent the other half, addressed to " Messrs. Cooper, wine manufacturers, Bristol." That seconkd half never came to hand. On the 21st of Januav a letter was received at the Swindon Bank in these words:-

The manager of the Swindon Bank sent an answer directing Allen to go to Stuckey's bank at Bath the next day, and the money would be raid him. Information was given to the police, and oxe of the body was set to watch at the bank. the prisoner came to the bank and had the letter in his hand which had been written to Allen by the mager of the Swindon Bank. He was asked how he hadobtained the half-note, and he said he had picked it up in BristoL It was proved that the prisoner had dictated the note purporting to have been signed " G. Allen" and sent to the Swindon Bank, but there was no clue to the manner in which he had obtained the half-note.
The prisoner was found iiltiy and sentenced to eight months' impisonment, bnt a point as to the jurisdiction was reserved.
Robert Painter was indicted for breaking into the dwellinghouse of John Emberry, and stealing thereout 11 soyereigns.
Mr. Arney prosecuted.
It appeared that in December last the proeecutor locked up his cottage at 7 o'clock in the morning and went out to work, leaving 11 sovereigns in a matchbox. On his return at 5 in the afternoon he found one of his windows had been broken, the shutter torn down, and that the house had been entered and the 11 sovereigns taken. The prisoner, who was his nephew, had been seen aboutthe cottage in the course of the day, and it was discovered that the next day lie bad been purcha'ing quantities of clothes and a carpetbag in the adjacent town, and he was traced to Bath, where all clue was lost. In about a month the prisoner was discovered brealkng into the same house, and he was apprehended.
The prisoner's defence was that the money he had expendea was money he had received when he was discharged from the convict-ship, he havin been convicted before of breaking into the same hottse, and sentenced to seven years' transportation, but after serving about two years he had been discharged on a ticket of leave.
The prisoner was found G!uliyt, and proof rwas given of his former conviction.
The LoRD C}F JUSTICN told the prisoner that he must bo placed in such a position that he could not for some years molest his uncle, and he would now be sent to penal serzitude for six years,

This was an action brought by the plaintiff to recover damages from the defendant for the seduction of his daughter.
Mir. E. Jarnw Q.C., and Mr. Rodwell were for the plaintiff, and Mr. AL Chambers, Q.C,, and Mr. Iforne for the defendant.
The plantiff in this action, it appe red, was a grocer at Hemne-bill, near Canterbury, and the defendant was stated to be a person of property residing with his mother in the same neighbonrhood, at a short distance from the plaintiff. The young woman who was the unfortunate subject of the inquiry was about 28 years old, and the defendant was stated to be considerably on the wrong side of 40. It appeared that the intimacy iirst commenced between them about three years back and that it continued until the beginning of the last year, when the plaintiff's daughter prove inthe familyway, and she gave birth to a child that was still surviving, in the following month of June. The defendant, it appeared, was then apphed to, but he denied that there had beau any improper intimacy between him and the plaintiffs daughter, and asserted that the child was not his, and the present action was the result.
The daughter of the plaintiff a very good-looking young woman, was examined, and she detailed the circumstances under which the intimacy arose between her and the defendant. She was subjected to a very severe cross-examination by Mr. Chambers, and she stated in answer to questions put to her by the learned counsel that the defendant first accosted her as she was returning from church, and that she conversed with him for some time, and that an assignation was made between them, and the defendant told her that when he "w anted her" he would wave his pocket-handkerchief before her window. She said that upon the first occasina when this was done she did not intend to meet the defendant, but she happened accidentally to walk past a plantation that belonged to his mother, and he came out to meet her, and they walked together in the meadows. The same thing occurred on some other occasions, and on the third time she met him she said that the defendant succeeded in overcoming her virtue. After this their interviews were continued at intervais, and always took place in the dusk of the evening. The witness also admitted that she had walket out in the evening with four other young men, whose names were mentioned, and that she sad also met by appointment with another gentleman of property in the same neighbourhood; but she asserted most positively that nothing improper took place with any of those parties; and that she had not beeni connected improperly with any other man than the defendant.
Mr. CisiAsnRs, in his address to the jury, contended that the action was a trumpery one, and that the matter ought to have been settled before a magistrate by an order of affiliation, and not have been made the subject of arn inquiry of this kind. As to the charge of seduction, he said, it appeared to him that If there had been any seducer in the case it was the young woman, and not the defendant, who was arrived at a time of life which rendered him a vry mkelI subject for an attack of this desra fthon
He admit it was an unfortunate thing for a t.ther to have a froward daughter, but he said the jury were bound not only for their own protection, but for that of every one placed in a similar situaton to the defendant, to take care not to give damages for seduction wzhen no seduction had in reality taken place.
Mr. Justice Cs.xSSwEu, having summed up, the jury after a ehort deliberation returned a verdict for the plaintiff -Damages, 401.
CROWVN SIDE.-(Before Mr. Baroin CH]NmLL.)
John Loyles was indicted for feloniously cutting and wounding Michael Strachan, with intent to do him some grievous odily harm.
Mfr. Russell condncted the prosecution; the prisoner was defended by Mr. Ribton.
The circumstances of this case were somewhat peculiar. The prisoner, who is both deaf and dumb, and who had the evidence interpreted to him by his wife. who, by signs and other means, was able to hold communieation with him it appeared, was at Sheerness on the night of the 12th of October, when, by some means or other, a scuffle took place between him and some other men in the street, and, according to the evidence of the prosecutor, he was standing quietly by and taking no part in the matter, when the prisoner came up to him and deliberately stabbed himn in the groin with a knife, and inflicted a very severe wound. The story told by the prisoner when before the magistrate, in answer to the charge, was that as he was going home he was assailed by several men, and that the prosecutor was one of them, and that as he passed him he knocked him down, and that he was afterwards robbed of bis cap, neckerchief, and 21. n money; and this story was confirmed to a considerable extent by the condition in which the prisoner was found at the tine, there being very little reason to doubt that he was actualy robbed at the time of the transaction.
Mr. RIBTON made a very earnest address to the jury on behalf of the prisoner, and he submitted to them that as, from his unfortunate infirmity, he was unable to call out for assistance, or to give any alarm, when he found he was attacked in this manner he was justified, under such circumstances, in making uase of the knife to protect him-
self;, had that,althoughtlhve postecutor,there was reason to 'beiev, hd nthig o d wih te rbbey,yet that the lirisoner might, under the circumstances, reasonably have sup posed that he wvas one of the party.
The jury returned a verdict of A'ot Guilty.

ELRCTION INTELIGBYC.9
CITY OF LONDON REGISTRATION ASSOCIATION.
e arcernoon a general meeting of the Lendot Liberal Registration Association was held at the London Tvern, to consider the present etate of the representation of London, with a view to the approaching general election. C,onsiderable interest seemed to be felt in the city as to the result of the meeting, and reporters from all the daily jornals were in attendance, evidently under the impressla that there couldbenoobjectionto makingpublictheproceedings. The meetir,g, however, was a pretical satire uon the progrs ot liberal Institutions in the city of Lonon, Inasmuch as it was considered advisable that the representatives of the public press should not be present, and acoordingly, to the surprise, and we believe also to the deep annoyance, of manyl of the members of the association, their entrance was guarded against with the atnwost jealou7. By way of a Bet-off to this unusual proceeding an indirect offer was mado that a caref oly prepared digest of the proceedings should afterwards be given to such of the representatives of the press as chose to use it. But, acting upon the belief that such an abstract of the proceedigs would never bave been offered had it really contained an impartial sunmary of what took place at the meeting, and as we never offer to our readers reports for the accuracy of which we cannot rouch, we fee} bound to exclude this xp arak statement from our columns.
Fortunately the loss to our readers will not be great, al from other sources we are enabled to inform them of what really took place: The announcement of the retirement from the representation of the city of Lord John Russell and Mr. Materman was made and received with a oold and most significant silence.
The nomination of Sir J. Duke was also coldly received, and the silence was only broken by Mr. Alderman Saomons and Mr. J. A. Hankey, both of whom urged strong objections to the hon. baronetes return, among other subject, on the ground of his having utterly withheld and refused h support to the Liberal candidate for East Sussex, Mr. Dodson. The nomination was afterwards assented to amid strong manifestations of adverse feeling on the pat of the meeting.
The nomination of Baron Rothschild was agreed to unanimously, and amid much applause.
The name of Mr. R. W. Crawfurd was also given as a fit and proper per3on to re present the City of London in Parliament, and was received with much approbation and adopted unammously.
Mr. Raikes Crrie, the present member for Northampton, was proposed as the fourth member. Mr. Baikes Currie in reply tendered his acknowledgm,ents to the meeting for the honour conferred upon him, but could not brea off, on so short a notice, his connexion with his present constituency, which bad subsisted for more than 20 years. He solicited the indulgence of the meeting to allow him 48 hours for consideration. Upon this it was moved that the meeting be adjourned to some future day. After some discussion, it was eventualy agreed that the meeting should be adjourned to Tuesday next to hear tbe final determination of Mr. Currie, and also to affrd Sir James Duke an opportunity of explaining, if he could, his conduct in reference to the late Sussex election. Tho meeting was accordingly adjourned.
AYLEsBuRY.-Mr. Layard has been to visit his constitaents, but in consequence of the all but unanimous dissatia. facion expressed at his vote against Lord Palmerston he is not likely to contest the borough.
ASIIBURTON.-It is not probable that there will be any contest here, and Mr. Moffatt will be elected, it is thought, without opposition.
BRsrToN.-Both the pregent representatives, Admiral Sir G. B. PecheU and Lord A. Hervey, will, it is expected, offer themselves for re-election, but a contest will take place chiefly in opposition to the return of the latter Conservative member who voted in the majority against the Government on the China question. Mr. E. S. Creasy, the barister, and Professor at Universit College, London, who is a native of Brighton, intends being a candidate at the copning election. Mr. William Coningham, of Kemp-town, Brighton, has also nnounced his intention of offering himself as a candidate on Liberal principleg, andinhis address he rays:" In the presenttate of politicalparties, and under existing circumstances, I shall deem it my duty to give an independent support to Lord Palmerston.'sGovernment." Mrz. Coingham also states that he is an advocate of gradual and progressive reform and retrenchment, the vote by ballot, and civil and religions liberty.
CALNE-General Sir William Williams of Kars seeks re-election. There is no sign of opposition.
CAsMBRIDGL-Mr. Mowatt does not intend to offer himself for Cambridge.
CAITERBURY.-Mr. C. Parton Cooper, Q(C., a Liberal, has issued an address. Sir Wiliam Somerville is also in the field on the iAberal interest, and Mir. C. . Lushingtoa, a liberal Conservative, wiU again come forward. The last gentleman will be supported by a large number of the Liberal electora.
Cit&nws.-Mr. G. W. Romaine, C.B., who has been brought forward bythe Liberal party in this boreugb, is the only candidate at present before the electors, Captain L V. Vernon, the present Conservative member, notintending to offer himself for re-election. Oa Menday evening Mr. Romaine addressed a large and influential meeting of the Liberal electors, at which he justified the course the Government had adopted with reference to hostilities in China. He expressed himself in favour of an extension of the franchise and vote by ballot, hut was against the entire abolition of church-rates, except In those parishes where they had not been levied for some years At the concusion of the meeting it was unanimously resolved to support Mr. Romaind at the approaching election. It is not expected that there wiL be any Conservative opposition.
CovB.NTRY.-Sir Joseph Paxton offers himself agaIn for this borough. In his address to the electors he denies that he had any intention of factiously opposing the Government by voting for Mr. Cobden's motion. In reference to this subject Sir Joseph says--
"A*ter a most careful and anxioug examination of the correfrendence on the subject, and of the arguments urged in debatehaving given every weight to the difficult position of Europeans at Canton and other Chinese ports-I eould not conscientiously refrain from testifying my disapproval of the extreme measures which were resorted io without the sanction of the home Government. Belieing, als, that the IBouse of Commona should exercise a constant control over our agents abroad, I felt obliged to aSdopt the only practical means I possemed of assertian the right of Parliamentary intev ference in the affairs of our distant possessIons. In the late struggle with Russia I aupported on all occasions, ad with unvarying steadiness, the prosecution of the war to the final triumph of our polcy. Xo Englishman is more jesous than my"3
the honour and greatness of his country, or more desirous that her guardianship orer her citizens should be felt in every region of the world; but however degirded may be the character of our enemieshoaswver atrocious may be the acts to which they have resorted In retaliation, I could nelther anction by my vote in its favour, nor refran by silence from denouncing the b'ombardment of a great city teeming with a defencelesa populatIon for no better reaons thau those which have hitherto been put forward on behalf of our agents in Chinl.-
DA,R.nfoun,-Arn addre6s to the Chairman of the proposed Dartmouth Railway, Mr. Charles Seale Hayne, has been numerouslysigned, asking that gentleman to come forward as a candiate; nd Mr. JohnstoneNeale (Liberal), who resides in the neighbourhood, issued an address, in which he presented himself to the electors as a candidate. At a public meeting, however, it was stated that Mr. Lindsay, MP. for Tynemouth, who has previously contested the borough, and who has made the port a packet station, would support the p resent member Sir ThomasHecrbert; upon which MSr. Neale expressed his determ,ination to withdraw, and the friends of Mr. Hayne agreed to withdraw their candidate in order to avoid a contest. This result, however, hasgivenmuchumbrage to some of the Liberal electors, and the matter is not likely to end there.
D]VONiORT.-On Monday evening Sir Erskine Perry, M.P. for Devonport, addressed a large meeting of his constituents at the Mechanics' Institate. His speech was confined chiefly to the China question and tho reasons by which he was actuated in giving his support to Mr. Cobden's motion, and the consequent defeat of Ministers. He argued that we were not justified in resorting to extreme measures, which were, he believed, niot only deplored in the House, but also throughout the country where the true facts of the case were known. He believed the disturbances were brought about by the arrogance of Sir John Bow-riug, who had acted in direct defiance of the instructions he had received from Lord Palmerston, when Secretary at War, and Lord Clarendon. Dr. Bowring's predecessor, Sir George Bonham, whern appointed by Lord Granville, was distinctly told that his Government did not believe any good results would follow by our persisting in entering Canton, and requested him to avoid, as far as possible, any discussions with the Chinese that would tend to break our social relations. Sir Eraline submitted that Sir John Bowing had acted so contrary to his instruchtions that the people could not place further confidence in him; and his object in voting with Mr. Cobden was that he might be recalled and another officer sent out to fill his place. He knew that in giving that vote he should offend A large number of his constituency, but he voted as his conscienoe dictated, firmly believing that our proceedings at Canton were unjustifiable, and he had only raised his voice on behalf of more mnoderate, liberal, and Christian doctrines. Sir Ersekine denied that it was a factious party who had supported Mr. Cobden. Such men as Sir r>ancis Baring, Lord John Russell, Mr. Robartes, and others were above voting other than as their feelins led them. Sir Ershkne expressed his opinion that in the forthcoming Parliament Lord Palmerston would have a larger majority of supporters than he at present had; that he was the only man in whom the country could place confidence, or at least who was strong enough to form a Government; that he had deserved weli of his country in upholdingBritishhonourin a time of great d:nger; and he (Sir Erakine) should deem it his duty to vote with hisn when he was in the right, but a ainst hint when in the wrong.
Atthe loste of Sir Erikine asrpeech the following resolution
"That the vote tiven by Su T. ^Perry on the Chinsee quesion is notio acoordance with the feelin and oDinions of the Liberal electors of this boroogb, who have every confidence in the Ability, uprih uness, and integrity of Lted Pasnerston aud his Government,"
A scene of great eosifusion followed, and at length, after two or three influential gentlemen had spoken against Sir Erskine, it was Aecided not to press the resolution untl the hon. gentlema had explained himself to the electorsof Stonehou8e, wb he intended Addressing on the following evening.
EXETE n-.The p resent memeers are Mr. Divett (Libeal) and Sir J. . B. uckworth (OConservative). Some of the Conservative p arty are said to be dissatisfed with their member, and there jBsa talk of brllnga forward Mr Richard

Kzli.-For West Rent the Conservative candidate is Mr. W. Masters Smith, one of the sitting members, and it is rurnonied that Mr. H. Hoare, the weU-known London banker, or 3Ir. Stoddart Douglass, formerly, for a sborttimse suepaber for Rochester, will be invited by the Conservativestostand. Lord Holmesdale, thechiirman of the ConservativeBRegationAssocation, hasissued acircular, in which be announces that Mr. Masters Smith and another Conservative will be brought forward, without naming the second p n. The Liberal candidates will be Mr. C. Wykeham Mati, the sitting member, who was only returned after a severe contest at the beginning of last month, and Afr. Whatman, one of the present nmembers for 5daidgtone. Both gentlemen have Isued addresses, in which they state their mtention of giving an independent support to Lord Palmerston's Government. In East Kent it is understood that the Conservatives will again bring forward Mr. Deedes, who is not likely to ba opposed. It appears to be doubtful, however, whether Sir zi. Dering will again be nominated.
KTDDXRMINSTER_-Mr. Lowve has arrived here, and offers himself for re-election.
&LlCOLNSBhR.-IUnder this head yesterday it was stated %hat the Right Hon. I. C. N. Hamilton, who retires from the northern division, would probably be returned for one of the Scotch burghs. Mr. Hlamilton, we understand, does not intend to solicit the suffrages of any borough constitueney whatever.
LIVERPOOIL-The Liberal leaders here have determined to pursue a more judicious policy than that announced by the Conservatives at the approaching election. They do not object to the re-election of Mr. HorsfalL Indeed, they are favourable to his return; and at the meeting of the Reform Association yegterda they decided not to oppose him. Mr. J. C. Ewart was declared to be a fit and proper person to represent the borough, and he will receive the concentrated support of the Liberal party, which has latterly increased considerabl in strength, with the assistance of a large section of e Conservatives, who were so decidedly opposed tothenominationof Mr.Charles Tnrnerthataseriour spsithas beencausedint heTorycamp. Theyare wellcontent that the representation of the town should be thus divided, and the result of the election will no dou'et be the return of ffr. Horsfall and Mr. J. C. Ewart, and the defeat of Mr. Turner,
LY3rE-REGS-an The Times of yesterday the nanre of Mr. Templer was erroneously printedlTemple. Mr. Temnpler, as alreadt stated, declines to become a candidate under present circumstances, aud says that with every prelilection for Liberal-Conservative principles he cannot conscientiously support a party in a factious attempt to overthrow the present Government through the medium of a coalition made up of mnen hitherto so uniformly and so widely opposed to each other.
WAIDsTolivo-Mr. Lee, one of the sitting members, and Mr. Humphrey Mildmay, will be nominated en the Liberal interest. The Conservatives have only announced one candidate-namely, Mr. A. J. B. Beresford Hops, but it is I donbtful whether'he wil consent to stand, as there is a very
strong feeling against him in the borough in consequence of his Tractarian tendencies.
MAycnEsr-No opposition candidateg have yet declared themselves for Manchester. Mr. James Aspinall Turnerhas declined to come forward. A meeting of the election committeeof thesittingmembers was to be held last evening, at wvhich lfr. T. M. Gioson was to be present. In answer to the resolution of the Commercial Association on the division on Mr. Cobden's motion, transmitted to Lord Palmerston, the following letter has been received rem his Lordship:

Yesterday morning Sir Samuel Bignold issued an address to the electors. No public movement had up to noon yesterday been made by the Iiberal party, nor had any address appeared from Mr. Warner, the other member for the city. An appeal setting forth the claims of Lord Palmerston to the gratitude of the electors was published on Monday evening.
OLDtLAm.-There is now no doubt (says the Manchester Guardian) that Mr. James Platt, of Harford Ironworks, will be brought forward as a candidate for the representation of the borough in Parlament at the ensuing election.

Baronet defends the course he took upon the motion which defeated the Ministry in these terms:-
" I will resume ivery shortly the opinion to which I came after a cAreful and earnest cousideration of the papers That bylaw the Amro was not a British vessel, and not entitled to By the English fag; that there wus no Droof ofpremeditated insalt on the part of the Chinese authorities; that there was no proof in the papers of any series of insilts offered by the Chineee Government. I had no choice eft, ma deliberately, and s if I had been in the jury-box, I gave my vote that the pepers laid upon the tabre failed to establish satisfactory grounds for the violent meaures rorted to at Canton on the late MrIir of the Arrow."
This circular of Sir Francis, which is a very lengthy lone, has not tended to improve the impression made by his vote.
PLYasov'-A meeting of Liberal electors took place at Plymouth on Monday afternoon, Mr. Thomas Were Fox in the chair, when it was resolved-" That a cordial union of the Liberal electors is essential to secure the election of two fit representatives of the borough in Parliament ;" and " that a committee of 30 electors of aU sections of Liberals be appointed to invite competent persons to address the electors in reference to the representation." Some of the prominent speakers who supported Mr. Palmer at the last election expressed their determination to oppose him now, and to carryr out the intention of the meeting by sending to Parliament a more saitable colleague for Mr. Corier. Yesterday (Tuesday) afternoon Mr. Palmer issued an address, stating that it wias not his intention to offer himself for reelection.
ROCRT R.-Mr. P. W. Martin, one of the present members for this city, wil again be brought forward by the Liberal party, in conjunction with Mr. ierjeant Kinglake, the Recorder of BristoL Mr. Serieaut Kinglake is in favour of an extension of the suffrage, of the abolition of churchrates, and also advocates the adoption of Tote by ballot. Mr. Martin voted ir the minority against Mr. Cobden's motion.
SAisrSURY (CrIT).-We cannot learn that any change is intended, but there are four candidates for Devises.
SUNDLERLID.-In anticipation that Mr. Hudson will not present himself for re-election, Mr. Rtichard Hoare, of the firm of Hoare, Buxton, and Co., merchants, London, has issued an address to the electors of Sanderland, announcing himself as a candidate on the Liberal interest. Mr. Hudsorns friends, however, affirm that he will again stand, and that he may be expected in the town in a few days.
TAuT0ro1.-The Right Hon. H. Labouchere wliU
offer himself for this borough, which he has so worthily represented for many years. Sir John Ramsden wiiU not come forward for Taunton, but it is said wiU seek the
representation of the West Hiding, in opposition to Mr. Cobden, or prohably stand for the berough of Hluddersfield, where he has considerable property The Conservatives will bring forward Mr. Arthur Mills, who was elected in 152, and unseated on petition for bribery The Liberals have secured a candidate to contest the second seat for this town.
TIVMBTO,.-This borough is in an unusual state of excitement in the prospect of a dissolution of Parliament. Lord Palmerston has declined the invitation to stand for the city of London, although, doubtless in anticipation of his accepting the proffered honour, an address to the ele. torssof Tiverton has been issued, requesting them to withhold their pledges until it was asertained who would solidt their suifrages. The noble Viscount remains true to his Tiverton cnstituensy, and any attempt to oppose him here iould he futile. His colleague, Mr. Heathcoat, is ex pected to retire, on the dissolution, from Parliamentary life, owing to inreased age and infirmity.
TY ximoum.-Mr. W, S. Lindsay has issued an address in defence of his vote on the China question. In the course of his address he says -
I w not actuated by any party or factions motive I am not, *A you are aware, a member of nmy * Peace society,' bat I lore peace, aud, above al.

The paty with whom. Mfr. Lindsay went into the lobby, the Derbyites, are not acting very graciously towards the hon, member, for, taking advAntage of the division in the Wiberal ranks, they are attempting to organize a formidable op position to unseat him We understand that the leaders of the party had ameeting with er Hugh Taylor on Saturday, and that that gentleman consented to become a candidate, provided a epectably signed requisition was pre-
sinted to hmaehsrw rbbe r.W eto,i
W^-TItm.,here are three candidates in the field for the representation of this borough,-Mrh Dras the stting member, a Derbyite, end Colonel Byrton, his son-in la W will offer ther4selves on the Conservative ilnterest; lr Joh Ofales owncralt, Liberal, rho formerly represented Wareham, has commenced an actie canvass as a supporter of the Palmerston Goversdnent.
WEsTIISTER.-Mr. Westerton, the churchwavrden of St. Paul'6, Knightsbridge, the promoter of the suit against the Honu and Rev. th Liddell, the incnmbent of St Paul and St. Barnabas, having been asked to become a candidate for the representation of the city of Westminster in Parla. ment, hos consented to be put in nominatino condution, that a requisiton be prelented to him s.lientiynumero" i

WESr RmnyIOM BoXteGnsi-Wito the past dy or towo the candidates for several of the West Eiding bozoughs have been rought ont, and arrangements are in active progress
enerally. As to the West riding nothing is te, deanitely known; btt Lord Godenrch's name is mentioned with a good deal of confidence, though his vote on the Chinese question has rather damaged his position, both in the riding ana with hs present constituents. At Leeds the Liberals have announced the Right Hon. 1m T. B ates and rl F. Carbntt, one of the diors o the Midland Raiway, and for many years an extensive wvool-merchant in the town. He is put forward by those known as the advanced Liberals, *nd is an opponent of Church and State and of State education. A meeting i caUd for Fnrda evening next, at rhich the candidates are to he present, The Conservatves are aIso movitg, and the adhress of Mfr. . Hall, barrister, will probbly be issued to-day. So far as we can learn it is not proposed to nominate more than one Conservative candi.
ate, lUr. Hel was brought out somewhat hastily at the LAst election it conjunction with Mr. Sidney, of London. At Bradford a meeting of the electors was held on Mondye night, when it was resolved to bring out Major-Generail Thompson and Mr. Titus Salt. There is no donbt that mr, Wickham, one of the prosent members, will also be nomintted, and receive the support of a rthge number of the Ltberal party. At Wakefed Mr. etham is annonced as a candidate. He is aWhig, andwvill probably bcopposd. A t Ripon it is stated that the Hion. H. LasceUles wFill retire. There is a prospect of a contest at Thirsk, in the North Biding, Sir sharles Douglas having addressed the electors in opposition to Sir W. P'. GaUlwey.
WIT.s A0om)-Mr. Sidney Herbert, Mr. Wynfhain, and Lord fenry ithe are canvassing for this divton of the county, and ts expected thtthe contest wll be a very severe one.
SCOTLAND.
CAANAAR..-Mr. Thompson, the member for Aberdeen, has mtimated his intention to retire from the representation ofthatcity. At a special meeting of the Towun Honcil held on Mronday Provost Webster expressed his regret that Mc r
Thompson had felt it to be his duty to take this step, and read a farewell address to th constituency which he had just received from their member. The council wfithout giving any opinion as to the vote on Mr. Cobden's motion unanimottsly agreedtoexpress their regret atMr. Thompson's retirement, and to tender him their hearty taxnks for his excellent conduct as their representative. Mr. John Farley Leith, barrister, of London, and Professor of Labw in Haileybusy College, is a candidate for the vacant seat.
CLACtAENKA? this EIStYOSS.-ay r. J. Johnstone, the member for these couties, announces his intention to seek a renewal of the confidence of his constituents. His support of Mr. Cobden's motion has, along with other votes, created considerable opposition, so that it is very likely his reeection mray be challenged. At a meeting held at Allos, on
riday, a tunanimous desire was expressed to secure the services of the Lord-Advocate, who is connected by family ties and otherwise with the combined coutHes. There is, how ever, no chance that his Lordship wiill give np the more important constituency of the Leith burghs, even for the cetainlty of being returned for these counthes. Mr. Adam, jtn., of Blatradam, who contested the representation with OMr. 5Johnstione in 185, is spoken of with more probability
coreta htof hioigfraffrd.n uhassacoadspott
tIFtSorEs-In this cowuny (says the rotsmat) the present Liberal member, somewhat contrary to ex-pectation, will offer aotin; but it is understood that Mr. Hlay Wemt of h emdss, son of tho late Admiral Wemyss, lon representaive of the county, also intends to come forward on Laberal princsples.
ROxBURGSlIsIRE,-ThO Hon. J. B. Blliot has addressed his constitnency', stating that so soon as Parliament dissolves it is his iantenton to visit them, to solicit their suspport in the forthcoming election. Hfe says that on the Chnese qutestion he had no hesitation in voting against Mr. Cobden's motion. The censutre of Government in the matter, hositilities having commenced without their knowvled8e, appeared to him quite useless, inasmuch as it wams qmtee certain that no Government could have followved any other coutrse than that of affording susch assistance and support to the authorites in China as wvould give the greatest practicable sccarity to the British inhabitants until an djustment of the points in disputte could be arrived at. He trusts
tat his conduct en the occasion is approved by the electors of Eoxburgh, and that they wl rly round Lord Palmersten with a hearty and determined sutpport.
