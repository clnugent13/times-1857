The almost total failure of the crops of ls,t year has brought about a state or absolute want and famine, which nweon alleviated by speedy esupplien mnust lead to very disastron results. The autumn nown crops have .lso Iseern cut off by the severe frot, and threatens a continuance of tb's famine thsregh another season, as the people are consuming their seed coru.
The, e sufferings hare bcen nzgrivated on some parts of the coast by the lee-cs brought on the,unuffeadjng Inbabitauts duiring the war, the. catt!e aunt etores of the ptesesta havinsg been carried oif, and the boals and nets of the fishermien destroyed. The irr-taton arising out of these -jts has been very great. and the feeling of hostiLity to England Cud the Eng ish is openly mra.ifested amoong the people.

This Company is established to weeg the Dun Motatajn Copper Mines, in tke province of Nelson, New Zealand, and within ten miles of that port.
These mines were discovered in the early part of the year 1852, by a, mineral surveyor of considerable experience, who rePorted the discovery to the New Zealand Governoaent, uopn which steps were taken by the authorities, as well sas by the inhabitants of Nelsen, to have careful surveys made of the district, with a view to prove the existence of the mineral products thus broughbt to their notice. The resualt of the explorations made by the Government geoloasit, and confirmed by other mineral ass-rveyoin, waas atisfactory. Sir George Grey, the then Governor, directed the publiction of the same in the Governmenit Gas-tte of 29th, June, 1852; and a company wast oonsequently formed at Nelsn, on the 8th ot October, in the same sear. under the title of the " Cook's Strast Mining Company." The resources of the colony being very ltaslted, the promoters determined to doepatch an agent to England to rai5e the amount niocessary for the rucoesstul opening of the maines. This gentleman reached England in March, 1854, the preciss pertod of the detlartion of was with Russia, and therefore at a unset Inopportune moment for promoting the views of the Nelson oIn-. fliatt. Nevertheless, indused by the Tery fAvourable specimens which were brought over, by the bigh character of the parties he represented In the colony, as well as the documnents transmitted by them, the gen*. tlemen whose names appear upon the Direction, with others pus-- ehaaed the freehold, with mnineral risihle, of a portion of the Dun Mlountain and adjacent lands, coprsng about 1,087 acres.
To 0atCrten fu,lber the'valueofthe mines. a staff of 26 men with am Is mnaterials for prosecuting the works, were despatched; anxd, on tboX arrival in New Zeaand, itseir attention was directed to the existence of the lodes in an elevated part of the mountain, from which eight tons of ore were extracted and rent over to thia coDuntry, and found to contaLin a percentage of 178 of fine copper. I
In order further to test the value of the lodes, they wore searched for, anid agaln stmucgin a gully 1,800 feet below the previous workeings, by an adit of six feet. Conclusive eTidesace having been thus obtained of the mine holding good In depth two tons of ore wore ex. tracted and forwaitlad, and the result of tlRl Parcel, after having been faily resed or aret t Sansa, Ieled211 per cent. of fine coper te rf eodus podcin fom08 o 3~prcet. per ton of ore whchconiss o a ra sophrotwit rch edand black oxyde and atie cope, aso trog allo enphu ot,tedetails of whio

Letter from Messr. Henry B3ath and Son.
Mining-office, Swansea, March 10, 1817.
Dear Sir.-In reply to seer favour of the 6th inst., We beg to ma%e the following remarks on the 48 bses of copper ore received fromt your Midne on the.Dun Mountain, New e.ealno
The contents oi these bags evidently consistedof the whole of the working of the lode, without an), attetipt at dressng,.
Wle drestred them by picking as well as we were able, and Obtained about one-third which yielded 213 Per sent.'line copper of the total quantity we set asde, the earthby portions and refuse weighing about 5 cwt. ; but ever. this contained about 6yer cent. of copper : the wools of the 40 baps contained on an average le per cent.
Ther were several portions of rich oxyde, and even pieces of metallic copper, but on ths we la no great strew ; the most enconus-aging feature intheomatter is The fact, that tha oreoconsisted principally of grey sulohurot, and that the oDpper is well diffused through the mass, instead of being in rich lumps.
Ittinfurther satisfactory tbat the ore has been found In the mame locality, but at aome distance from your 0o iginal workings in the Dun Mlountain, an evid ease that the copper exists In quantities in that mnouneain. and that this last lot, worked lower down the mounatain,onn. slo-ts in a much larger propertiou. of sulphuret tean the former let.
On the whole, we should say that the indications are increasingly favourable to your prospecta, and, as on a former OccasIon we expressed an opinion that there was quite sufficient inducement to mate a trial, all that has Occurred mnoe has only oontirmed on in the correctness of that opinion, and ot the advisability of going fuirther than youL have yet done in working the, mine.
We remiain, your truly,

To the ELECTORS of the CIrY of WESTMINSTER, Gentlemen,
~AN earlyv dissolution of Parliament having been Adeter,is..ed ripon, I beg again to teniher my services to you.
I venture to ask for a renswal of the contidence which you have done me the hionour to place i inme believing that 3ou will give mae credit for having endeavoured acxiously in s)o my duty as your repro. reniDttive. and in the hope i ou will consider that I have faithfully acted up to .11 thoese principles put forwarsi In my address, the advo. meayof which obtainedL for me, atthe lust election, the high distinction of beinz elected the representative of the great city of Westminster.
The courselI sa.ve puirsued In Parliament ig before you.
I have voted 0-n every occasion for further reform of the representation, for the extension of the frauchise. and for giving to elect-ors the protection of the ballot.
I have not lost an opportunity of recording my vote against aklt grants from the public puree for other than secular jiurporee. also against the levying of churcb-ratea, and in favour of reig es freedom, .nd I have endenvoured. as far as practicable, to advocate economy la the expenditure of public money. I gave the best support in mny rower to the paining of the Metropolis Local Mlanagement Act, brelieving that measure to be calculated to craiy out the true old nlglish principleof local relf-goveraraent.
I have ensieavoured to pursue an. independent morsne In Parliamenit
looking to measures rather the%n to men, following thereby the dictates of my own conscience. and carrying out, as I beclieved, the true feeling of the constituency. If It should be your pleasrure again to place Your trust In me, 7 sbali continue to advocate ouch measure as may ap pear to me to tend to the general welfare of the couintry, and shall be founid at all timnes at my past when business particularly reiating to the city of Westminuster demands attentiono.
As regards the important subject which has been the immediate Cause of the diseolution of the Present Parliament. I gave my vote in support of Lord Palmerston's Government from a firm couviction that, under alt the cirecimontances, no other rourses was opna to the Governmnent. To Lord Palmerston's vigour and determination in the prosecution of the late war the country owes much, and I rejoice in having been able to give him my vote on thin oeccason.
* ~~~~I have the honour to be Gentlemen,
YouLr faithful and obedilent servant.

While Hler Mdajesty's Minlotec at home were prepating to obtain, If possible, a peaceable aud sAtisfactory zettiemeat of that question by a. direct reference to the Chinese Emperor, our local authorities at Carton were, as It aDpeared to me, wholly unjnstified in mixng up thaLt question with tbeis existing dispute eante the seizure of the 12 men, and in directing, with the view of forcing an inmmediate rettlement of that question, hostile proceedings of extreme violence, even after ample reparation on the subject of their complaint, accord ing to their own recorded acknowledgement, had been obtained.

EBPBESBNTATION OF THB CITY.
The adjounned special meeting of the General and Parlia. rnentarY Committees of the London Liberal Registration Association, convened by sunmmons, was held yesterday in the large room of the Londo, TaTern, to consider the state of the representation for London, with a view to the impending general election.
Ir. J. Travers was called to the chair, and among the gentlemen present were Mr. Raikes Carrie, M.P., Sir James Duke, XLP., Baron Lionel Rothschild, MLP., fr. Cobbett, M.P., Mr. FL W. Crawford, Mr. Alderman Salomons, Messrs. J. Pilcher, Serjeant Parry, E. NVicholson, G. Stone, H. Bateman, F. Bennoch, W. Kirk, W. F. A. Delane, W. J. Hall, Samuel Morley, &c. &c.
The minutes having been read, and some usaal routine business gone through,
Sir J. Durx rose to explain his conduct towards the Liberal candidate at the East Sussex election. He said it Was hismisfortune to appear before them something like a culprit, so that he would bave to claim the indulgence of the meeting for a few minutet, in order that he might give a brief, and as he trusted a satisfactory explanation. The charge brought against him was one rather of omission than commission-in fact, it was for not having recorded his vote in favour of MIr. Dodson, the Liberal candidate. He had been in Parliament more than 20 years, and his votes had never failed to assert the liberality of his principles during the whole of thatlong period. He, however, had found that on the occasio n question the gentleman who had started ass candidate for East Sassex really entertained the most indefined political principles, and bis only desire to get into Parliament appeared to be for the purpose of supporting the present Government. On some most important points he differed from the principles vhich he (Sir J. Duke) had always conscientiously supported. Mr. Dodson, for instance, was quite in favour of church endowment, to which he was utterly opposed (cheers), for he had throughout contended against church endowment, and, above all, against the grant to Maynooth, which he consideredi the very keystone of the arch. (Cheers.) There was also another reason why he had not voted for Mr. Dodsoa, and that was that. he found that thAt gentleman was opposed to the ballot-a liberal principle which he (Sir J. Dlke) had long and strenuously supported. (Cheers.) On what ground could he, then, be called upon to support a candidate who held views so opposed to liberal princples, and who, perhaps, merely wished to get into Parlilment for the purpose of securing a Government appointment? For the same reason which had actuated him Mr. Cobden had also refused to support Mr.. Dodson, and had told the Mayor of Brighton, when canvassed by him, that he would not cross the street to -vote for suach a candidate. At the same time he might mention that he (Sir J. Duke) had canvassed some friends of hisfor Mr. Dodson. (Laughter, and cries of " That's rather inconsistent.") He sincerely hoped that 3fr. Alderman Salomors and the meeting would be satisfied with this explanation. Durinn the whole of the tfme he had sat in Parliament bie had done his utmost to promote the progress of dvil and religious liberty; from the day vwen he had first opened his lips in the House of Commons to support the Bill for the Repealof the Jewish Disabilities hi conduct bad been consistent. While he had had the honour of representing the citi7ens of London be could say that morning, noon, and night he had abeured on their behalf, and done his utmost to render himself useful to them. (Much cheering.)
Mr. Aldermafi SALOMONS said he should be sorry that any public matter should degenerate into a private discus. SIon. He, however, had considered that both Sir James Dake and himself owed too deep a debt of gratitude to the Liberal party not to use their utmost efforts in support of a candidate whostood on that interest. (Cheers.) He was, however, very glad to learn that Sir J. Duke had canvassed for Mr. Dodson, and, as that gentleman was again about to contest the county, he was sure he would have the hon. baronet's support, so that all cause of difference between them was removed. (Cheers.)
Mr. RAIKEs CuxsRm ,L P., who was received with mueh cheering, said, he believed it was generally understood that the meeting to which the chairman had already alluded was adjourned for the purpose of hearing whatever explanations Sir James Duke might wish to offer, and to receive his answer to the very flattering requisition which had been made to him (Mr. Raikes Currie) at that meeting, that he should come forward and stAnd for the city of London. But honourable as that offer was to him, he had stated that he could rot possibly accede to it before he had clearly ascertained that a seoond Liberal candidate would be returned forNorthampton. He had since ascertained that fact in the affirmative, and to his entire satisfaction. Mr. Gilpin, a gentleman known to many in that room, a Nonconformist, whose Nonconformist opinions were acceptable to many of the electors of Northampton, was, he beheved, the candidate selected. (Hear, hear.) But from motives which he was sure the meeting would appreciate, he had abstained from giving any opimon to the right or left as to the fitness or unfitness of any candidato whatever. It was essential at a time when majorities were narrow, that minor differences should be composed, and that all men who agreed on the vital points of civil and religious liberty sbould not seek about for points of difference but points of nmion, and should be prepared to present that compact front to the enemy- for he must call the anti-Reformers and Exclusionists political enemies-and that body was, they might depend upon it, quite compact enough to require al their powers of resistance to meet it. (Cheers.) At the previous meeting, to which he much regretted that the reporters had not been admitted (cheers), a resolution had been passed from the chair that the City of London should bo represented only by commercial men. He had taken no p,art in that resolution. He was not present in t e private room when it was framed, and he had expressed no opinion on it one way or the other; but, at the same time, he might say that on the general principle of that resolution he thought there were few in that meeting who would dissent from it (cheers), and it would plainly betoken great poverty in the land if among *U their leading bankers, merchants, and traders they could not gather together men fit to represent them in the Commons? House of Parliament from a city which had produced one of the most profound and original historians-Mr. Grote; one of the greatest practical political economists of the day-Mr. Jones Lloyd, and other men of the same kind whom he need not enumerate. If the meeting did not recognize that principle, he (Mr. Curnie) had no business there. He ad explained to his constituents at Northampton the high honour which had been tendered him, and that he had been caaUed upon as a commercial man to represent the cityof London, with which he had been so long connected. He should not have stood there that day if it was not for the confidence which the merchants and bankers of London had shown, if not in bim, at least in those who had gone before him. (Cheers.) He should not have been so anxious to have addressed the meeting that day but for one important circumstance. He bad been called upon to embody his sentiments in an address. That address was-as all addresses were at the bestbut a very imperfect explanation of political opinions, and in his case he had done so much to coneentrate his Tieows that many of his best friends had told him that it seemed tco exclusively Palmerstonian. (Cheers.) He, however, inest be their attention to this one paragraph of his address, which said that his political opinions, tested by his votes, had been so long before the public that he need not explain them now. He believed that theyhadbeenmaintained ft r 20 years consistently, fearleesly, and with entire independfnce. (Cheers.) He wished to observe that any elector who did not think that a sufficient explanation had ample rfans of obtaining fnrther information, either by referring to the votes of the House of Commons, or to the electors of Northampton, or to the many gentlemen in the city to ,whom his opinions were well known. It so happened that he had been called upon by the electors of Northampton whenhe had never been in Northampton in his hlfe; and he had said in reply, that he would only offer himself as their representative when they entirely understood his sentiments. Six months before the election took place he 'went down to Northampton and made a full, true, and explicit declaration of his opinions, and, though that statement was made nearly 21 years ago, it was based upon such broad principles that it was almost appecable to the affairs of to-day, except in its allusions to those great measures of reform which had since become law, and in carrying which through Parliament he had been, he might say, a humble though zealous supporter. (Cheers) In that address he had pledged himself to the principle of the ballot (cheers) and to the great principles of free trade in their fullest and widest sense, to electoral reform, and extension of the suffrage at least to every householder. (Cheers.) He had ever pledged himself to seek for the abolition of that great abuse the Established Church in Ireland. He entirely separated that church from the EstabEshed Church in England, in support of which he recognized the principle which applied its old endowments to religious uses, but he was against the Irish Churcb Establishment,[which hadibeen founded in injustice and was maintainedwith blood. (Cheers.) He did notwishtodwell upon his speeches, but he could not help referring to a speech he made in 1836, when the Government of Lord Melbourne was in power, and Lord John Russell led the House of Commons,-and which, with the singlo alteration of the word " Melbourne" to ' Palmerston,1v would apply even at the present day. The hon. gentleman then read an extract from his speech at the liorthampton Reform meeting in 1836, in which he stated that he would use his utmost endeavours to urge forward the Liberal party ithpahf effective reformn, and should earnestly despre.
care tne curtailment or abandonment oF just and necessary measures in the vain hope of conciliating the implacable
enemies of all real improvement. (Cheers.) He would ask the meeting had he acted on that sentiment or not; if ho bad, where 'would they find a man who had a better character from his last place ? (Great cheering and laughter.) &e had lived long enough to know how easily political professions were made, and also how easily they were broken. For himself, he would only ask them to refer to his votes, which he believed would be quite satisfactory to the electors. The hon. gentleman here reviewed at somelength his political career, showing how for years he had voted with a small but select minority on all the great questions affecting civl and religious liberty, and the sagacity as well as moral courage required by such a small band to sup'port year after year opinions which at fiist were far from popular. He also maid that on many such occaXcons e had been in a different lobby ftom 'that into which Lord J. Russcll's opinions led him. He did
rot wish .to say a word aEainst Lord J. Rusell, and be never could forget the great services which thatstatesman had rendered to the liberal cause (much -ceering); but he, in common with many friends, had often deeply regretted the course which on some most imPOrtant occcdsions Lord John bad felt it bis duty to take. (Cheefs) Lord 3. Russell,had addressed the electors of the city, in a moat able and ingenious paner, in which he said, among other things, that he put himself forward- aiheinBi in a' peculiarmanrer the advocate ofi tose out'f ion doc.
thines peac, economy, and reform. (Cheers;)H JSe did iot thit as quitefair for Lord 3. Rualseflltolaim to be
like "the voice of one cryaig in the wildernefss 'as If thev
larger section of the Libernl party had entitel5gone try
givup those great questiou. It astno t necessayfrnm(lr. Baikes Verrie) to go through the
divisiog lists, but if he did they would see that on many occasions he had voted for the questions of reform and progress when Lord John Russell had voted against them. (Cheers, mingled witheriesof "Whatha3 Palmerston doneforreformn?" and "What about Looke King'snmotion?" "Palraerston and peace," c.}) Mrr Crie continued, as to Palmerston and peace he might be wrong, but he beliered from his he&rt that Palmerston was the man to preserve the peace of Eutope. (Continued cheering.)
Would they, he asked, have ha a Russian war if Lord PalI merston had been Prime Mitister? (Cries of "No, no.") Would the Emperor of Russia have attempted with Palmerston what he ventured upon with the Earl of Aberdeen? (" No.") Some gentleman had mentioned the Persian war. Well, the Persian war had been settled with comparatively little or no bloodshed, and at the present moment England possessed a better position in Persia than she had held for very many years pest (Cheers.) Hsd they no hopes, he asked, of getting reform, and a large reform, from Lord Palmerston as a Prime Minister? He held in his hand an election address from a most important officer of the present Government (the Attorney-General) to the electors of the borough of Aylesbury, *nd vhat did that member of the Government say?7 He said that he excpected that in the next Parliament great
and important subjects would be deal with; that,-I
"The extension of the franchise, ind the removal of inequalItIes in cur electoral gystem, the continued reduction of expelditure. andisequentiy of taxation, si far as is considset witb the maintenvalce of establishments neoeary to preserve the honoutr and safety ef the country; the removal of tome remaining impedimants to commerca freedom; the completion of relSilous liberty, by tbe total exticitonot church-rates sud the removal of Jewish dlsabilites; the aboUtion or the ecleslsatical courts; the enactment of laws to repress dithonesty In trustees sd directors of public companies; the facUitatingof the sale and transfer of landed property; the Introduction of greater economy, despateh, and method into sereral departmenta of the ad' ministration of civn and criminal jnstice; and, lastr, an enlarsed s. ten of edunatlor of the people, were some few of the subjects which in the next Parlisment must engage the attenUton of sincere anad eon sctentloas men, and which he would be anxious to suppeort.
A gentleman in the body of the meeting hore asked if the hon. member was reading from Punc4, which occasioned much laughter and cheers.
Mr. CU-RBIE continued that they might take the addresI for what it was worth, but at least he might say that there was not a question in the list which he had just read which
as far as his humble abilities went, he- was nsot prepared to, support to the utmost of his power. (Cheers.) The electors of tE city had asked him to coine forward to represent them. The honour had not been of his own seeking, so he would not canvass a single votoe (Cheers.) He was a supporter of Lord Palmerston, and he thought all the country should support him in the present crisis. He knew from the best authority that ther the news of the adverse majority in the House of Commons was telegraphed over the continent despotie Courts were glad, and did not conceal their joy, for they hated Lord Palmerston, though t.heir hatted was largely mingled wvith fear and with respect. (Great cheering.) Electors, howvever, must be careful that they did not return men to Parliament who merely shonted "Pal. merston for ever " but who, nevertheless, when secure of their seats, would do nothing to advance the progress of liberal opinion. He should leave his case with perfeet confideuce in the hands of the electors of the city of London. (Much cheering.)
Baron LToN EL ROTHSCHILD said it was not his intention to address the meeting at any length that day, and his chief reason for rising was in conseqence of a statement which had been put into his hand, and to which his attention had been called by one of his supporters. It stated that a coalition existd between Lord John Russell and himself, and that it was his intention at the last moment to resign his:seat i favour of the noblelord. Ho (Baron Rothschild) had the greatest possible respect for Lord John Russell, and it would grieve him greatly if his lordship was not to have the honour of representing the city of London, but at the same time to talk of such a coalition as that which he had mentioned existing between himself and the noble lord' was quite out of the question, and was, in fact, sheer nonsense. (Cheers.) He could not como before them as his hon. friend who last addressed them had done, enumerating the many votes wbich he had given in support of civil and religious liberty, for he had never had an opportunity of serving them-all his claims existed in the great principle which had so long led the electors to support him. (Much cheering.) Hebelieveditwould beaproofof great weakness on his part if he for a m oment thought of resigning while the electors supported him, and he trusted that he should not see so just a cause as his deserted by so great and important aconstitdenyevasthat of the city of London. (Cheers.) He believed t'noy would carry their point in tho present state of political parties. He might be expected perhaps on that occasion to say some words With regard to his confidence in the p resent Minister and his ideas of the state of *ffairs with China. He was not an admirer of yesterday of Lord Palmnerston's foreign policy. To use a commercial expression, he had always been ready to endorse blindly his *nll confidence in the foreizn policy of the noble viscount (much cheering); and he believed that the English people alinost universally felt the same confidence as ho himself did. (Cheers.) With regard to his home policy it was a different question, and one which depended upon the anmount of pressure put upon his lordship from without. (Laughter.) It was the business of the electors to look to that, and see that they returned men of Liberal opinions, and that none got in under the Palmerston cloak who might afterwards bo among the first to desert the Liberal canse. With proper men to support the noble viscount, men firm and true in their Liberal opinions, the electors might depend upon seeing proper measures carried. He left his case in the hands of the electors, and trusted that he would meet with the same support which had returned him to Parliament on former occasions. They rmight rely that no exertions on his part wvould be wanting to inaure success to the great principles which they advocated. (Cheers.)
Mr. R. W. CRAWI'FORD said ho would only allude at the present to the two chief grounds on which he sought the suffrages of the electors. His career up to that time had not given him the means of referring to such an interesting autobiography as that to which they had listened from MIr. Raikes Currie. He had only been in Parliament for a very short time, so short, indeed, that he had only had time sufficient to give one vote, when he was unseated on the ground of the polling-booths having been closed at three minutes to 4 o'clock, instead of 4. Fortunately, short as his Parliameutarycareer had been, it was one to which he could now refer vwth real satisfaction, for the only vote which he had had time to give was one in favour of the balot . (tuch cheering.) He hoped the meeting would accept that at least as an earnest of the opinions which he entertained. He appealed to their suffra2es, also, as a commercal man, in which capacity he believed he was well and widely known in the city, and in which his experience would enable him to represent properly what might be caDed the Mincing-lane interest. (Cheers.) He would pledge himself to guard that and their other interests at aU times. (Cheers.)
Mr. S. MORLEY gave his reasons why, in case of a contest, he would not vote for Sir James Dake, but would give his hearty support to Lord J. Russell. (Cheers.) He objected entirely to Sir James Duke, not for what he had donein tho EastSussex election, but because ho disagreed entirely with his general Parliamentary career. (Cheers.) He found, for instance, that out of 198 Parliamentary divisions Sir J. Dake had only been present at 44, and that out of 44 special proposals brought forward in the House of Commons by men earnestly lbouring to advance the cause of Liberal progress the hon. baronet had been absent from 30 of them. That course might do for Lynn or Tavistocek-, but it would not do for the city of London (cheers), and, on the whole, he hadaarrived at the conclusion that Sir James Duke had not manifested that sincere and earnest spirit which would induce hiT p(Mr. Morley) to support hiu at the forthcoming elections. He would vote for Mr. Baikes Currie, though he thought his address was entirely Palmerstonian. He found in that address an unworthy sneer at Lord J. RueselL under a reference to those "fortaitous atoms," as they hbAd been called by Lord Palmerston. He believed, however, that Lord J. Russell would have a great place in history when the very names of the n-,isiest men of the present day were forgotten. (Great cheering.) He (Mr. Morley) would voto for Lord John Russell with all his heart. It was idle to call the resolution of the House of Commons the result of a combination, for among the men who had originated and supported that motion might be found the greatest namues in the whole kingdom Let them look at the representatives they returned, and not wake up after six months' time and find that they had committed the destinies of England to a body of men only selected upon the cry of " Palmerston for cver." (Cheers.)
After a few observations from Nr. W. J. HAtLL, who, amid cries of " Question," adverted to the disgraceful state of the river Thamesq, and wished the meeting to pledge the city miembers to urge its purification on the corporation, who were by law its conservators.
Nr. BEcNSOc rose, and strongly disapproved of confining the choice of members to represent the city of London in Parliament to merely commercial men. The constitnents of Lon. don ought to have the whole of England from which to choose those who were to take up their interests in Parliament, whether they were noblemen or the sons of noblemen, traders or the sons of traders. Under these circumstances he should move the following~resolution:-
"That any resolution attempting to confine the choire of the eleetorsof he city of London to gentlemen connected with commerce Is unwise in principle, and ought not to be countensmced by this lI4esal Association, because it impropetly narrows the area from which members of Parliament may beaselected; and that the rea,)ntion passed .lt Tuesday by tbis a eciation be rescinded.^
nob servic of Lord John Russell ought never to be for-
gottn. Why was he now opposed? Because he failedl in is negotiations at Vienna - but who knew what was done by him on that oeasiOn? ho knewbutwhatheactually carried out the intrtctions of the GovernVIent of which Lord Palmerston was amember? Wasthatmeeting to decide UPon the question without having hoard a word of what the noble lord had to say upon the subject? Last week they were not aware that the noble lord intended to come forward, although at that very time ho was ac preparing his address to the electors of the city of London. Letthm tlbei, wait until they knew precisely whaLt was the course the noble lurdl pnursue at Viennas. Tf the explana tion which he unaderstoed LoDrd John Russel in-l
tended to give on Thursday next should be satisfactory he (Mfr. Bennoch) shotld give the noble lor4L all the support he possbly could; but if, on the contrg, his explanation should be unsatisfactorv, aucdititshouldappear thatthe niollelord'spolicy was fettered, *es3k, anid narrow, he should then do all he could to opos
him, But he could not help contrastingstronglythe conuct
of lord -J. Russel niost favourably with t'hat of Lord Palmerstoq on the subjecPt of Parliamenitary Reform, Lord Palnierston once left the Adrainistration because he could not support the motion of Ldard John Russell on that subject; anid be had recently opposd the very modrt r

Hlis lordship w&S .oep~beed to abigoted. faction in thia counltr, whose policy, if adoeeWnfl, would Lave been destructive of a, great amnount of that libertywhic'h they now enj6oyed For thi,, undubtdl, h-deered hei hgbetcommendation,Bu his omepoliy ws th vey reers ofthat-which the city of Lodon h a vcated Mr.Bennoch concluded
Mr. Sroisx seconded theeresolution.
which was adopted by the c4mmittee at the meeting Of l-t vwelc That resolution, he said xsa8 pssed from ahelief'that the commercial interestb of tme city of London would be better eerved by the citizens being represented In Pariarnent by men of intlligence, who were conversant with domo efcial affairs, and wrho nmneratood tbe interests and tbe wants of commer¢il men. It wswell known that in the debates that had taken place for many years past, whatever their character, the city of London had n6t a rmember in thet assembly capable of taking a high Parliamentary position in those debates, even though the,y might havo involved matters most deeply conCerning their own commercial intere"ts If, therefore, four gentlemen edld be fonnd of extensive information and of high ocial position capable of representin the commercial interests of
ndon, undoubtedly they ought to be chosen. Instead of having men like Lord John Russell, who could not attend to city interests, they ought to have men practically conversant with commercial affairs. Although the committeo might have been right in bringing the resolution forward, yet he felt that in doing so they had placed the members of the association in a great dilemma. Thecommitteelhadtold them thatLordJohn Russellwas not going to start, but that was now shown to be a mistalke, and his lordship was about to renew his application to the dtizens as a candidate for their asuffges. Then, again, another candidate had come forward-Alderman Rose. whose announcement they had just read. Nobody, therefore, knew what would be the effect of these various and unconnected proceedings. The result might be to open the door to one or even two Cblservatives. There had, in fact, been no method, no concert, no good arrangement, bnt they were acting very much like great children. If it was to be a haphazard election, and if they were to go to vote for all kinds of men, and it those whom they most respected were to be sacrificed, then he would say it would be an eternal disgrace to the city of London. If four commercial men were to go to the hustinn and if, besides those four men, Lord John Russell and Alderman Rose Ehould also become candidates, he should certaistly give his vote for the men he thought best, but ia utter despair of success.
Mr. GASSIOT thought the Last speaker had shown the importanrce of harmony among themselves. If that were not secured there was great dauger that one or even two Tories might be elected for the city of London. The resolution proposed by the committee was intended to produce unanimity. At that time it Ws currently reported that Lord John Russell would not stand as a candidate, and Mr. Dilon, who had alway before preposed, ahd refused to propose him again. The reports from the different sections of the Liberal committee were of such a nature ns to showthat Lord John Bussell would have no chance of succes. Would they, then, drag Lord John Russell through the
Mr. BENNOCIL-I tell you, as a ntter of fact, that Lord John Russell is a candidate.
Mr. GASSIOT repeated that the Liberal committees round London hsd reported that Lord John Russell had not the
lightestchance. Mr.Dillon, an oldReformer,wouldnot have venturedto telLordJohuRussellthathe hadnot a chance if he thought he had. LordJohn Russell wasolected on a grand occasion to repreaent agreatrinciple If it was the opinion of the association that.Lord Palmerston should be elect-ed to represent a great principle, why then elect him. But it was unreasonable to expect that a lord should be able to carry out their local commercial interests. Their secretary had told them that the Liberal registration had increased by 2,000 voters. Let them not throw that advantage away. They were going to an election at an eventful tie, ; it was for a seven year PArliament, and they shoald recollect that the men who rdopisent the city of London would give a tone and charactel t6 that Parliament which the representatives of nko otherp1-lace could do.
Mr. GEDYE aid that on the former occasion he moved at the meeting be 4djourned because he thought their proceedings precipitate ind that it was only fair to their late representatives that theyshould have an opportunity to state their views to the electors; but beyond that he candidly avowed that the wholeo matter stated in the newspapers was unknown to him. Nothing more astonished him than the reading, in the account of the proceedings of the Liberal electors of the city of London, of their having excluded from a public meeting the reportersof the press. With regard to the present questions it might be right to have four representatives consisting of commercial men, but they ought not to limit ti.eir choice to the four men whose names wero mentioned in the resolution.
Ir. DOD said London ought to be represented by commercial men. No doubt, LordPalmerston, as representing a great principle, would be found to represent the opinions ot this country; but it was too much to expect that Liberal principles were to stand still because they were desirous of supporting the foreign policy of Lord Palmerston. But it should not be forgotten that support was about to be given to Lord Palmerston by very opposite parties. The great shipowners and city Tories were going to vote for him, because it was with them a great pocket question, while the Liberals were about to support him on another and a. broader ptinciple.
Mr. Deputy DAUNc said that if the mnotion of Mr. Pennoch should be carried it would ignore all that had been done, and they would be declaring that they were not yet repared to take any steps in advance as to what the great
Dy of the Liberal electors of the city of London ought to do. That was not the usual mode in which business was conducted in the city of London. A great commercial city ought to be represented by commercial men, and if they revoked the resolution of the former meeting they should giVe some sound reason for that conrse. LordJohnRussell, notwithstanding his antecedents, did not stand in that position- in Parliament which would justify the electors in again returning him their member. (Cheers, and cries of
- No .") Lord John Russell had failed in two great pasusges of his life-in his conduct on his return from Vienna. and mihis vote on the question of the Chinese war. Inr neither of those instances did he speak the 8tntimehts of the people of this country. While rendering all due honour to the noble lord's previous career, yet jtdging of the future from what had recently passed, he was not prepared to support the motion of Mr. Bennoch in favour of Lord John. Russell. He should therefore move as an amendment:-
"ThLt this meetlonr.haring heardtbeswntimenseofsir3amaDn~,g

Ir. Sro,;% seconded the amendment.
lIr. AlrPToRPx had never voted for Lord John Russell, becaus, among other resons, he as of opinion that a lord was not a fit person to represent the city of London; but he believed there was a principle involved in re-electing

Mr. Wnrrr, also declared his determination to support Lord John RusseUwhetherlir.Bernoch'smotionwvere amed or not, and he was quite oonvinced that a large portioa of the constituency would go with him.
TheCiL ChimsN uexpressed a hope that Mr. Bennoch wouldr withdraw his motion.
Mr. Bu\.ocis said he should not withdraw his motion; for this reason, that if they passed Mr. Dakin's amendment they virtually excluded everybody else from the oandidature, and thus condemned Lord John Russell without his having been heard. That would be a great injustice. f the meeting adopted the names of the four gentlemen propoEed on the amendment in a mas they would make a great mistake. There were among them men whom he would oppose, and others whom he would sunport; but if he were caled upon to vote for them in h bul nowould not do so, but would oppose them all (Laughter.) Ho therefore warned the meeting against a course that would lead to such a proceeding on the part of the electors. Nothing would be so i sounpopular, and so un-English. The names ought tobne put individually, and not conjointly.

Dr. SPAtIeES seconded the amendment, which was put and negatived.
Mr. Alderman SALO3IONS said that he had felt it his duty to the electors to observe on the conduct of Sir J. Duke apart entirely from aU personal feelin , and he now wished to tender him his hand, and he trusted that any difference between them would not extend beyond that room.
Sir J. Dosix said the behaviour of Mr. Alderman Saloe mons was so gentlemanly and so friendly that he cordially received the kind expressions which had fallen from him on this as on all other occasions. (Hear.)
A vote of thanks was then passed to the chairman, and the proceedings of the meeting terminated.

HOUSE OF LORDS, T1siY, ; AaRoH 17.
CRILINAL BREACHES OF TRIJST.
The LORD CHANCELLOR took his seat upon the woolsack at 5 o'clockc.
Lord St. LEONARD'S said he presumed that it was the intention of the Government to bring in next session a BiU to render in certain cases breaches of trust by executors and trustees criminal acts. He had no doubt that that BiM would meet with very general acceptance. Great care, how. ever, should be taken not to subject to criminal punishment such executors and trustees (whose office was merely grataitous) as acted innocently, although erroneously. He regretted to eee that the office of trustee and executor had been made a sort of business. Two Bils were introduced into Parlia. ment to enable the South Sea Company and another company to carry on, on a gigantic scale, the trade of executing the trust of every estate in the kingdom. The project of the former company was a failure, but the latter company had commenced business on the limited liabilty principle. Hc could not help feaming that a great number of trustees and executors would be compeled to procure the aid of that company in the execution of the trusts which had been reposed in them by their testators; but nothing could be more dangerous to the best interests of society than the penerson of the office of trustee and executor into a mere trade. His main object in adverting to this subject was to urge upon the Government the necessity of accompanying their promised Bill to render criminal certain breaches of trust by another measure for the protection of such trustees as might have honourably and innocently, altbough erroneously, acted in the execution of their office. He regretted that at present the courts of equity punished with extreme harshness trustees and executors even when it was proved that they ought not to be regarded as answerable for the breaches of trnst preferred against them, and therefore hoped that in the ensuing recess his noble and learned frieDd on the woolsack would consider the subject with the view of measmres being brought in next sesson not only for the punishment of criminals defaulting, but also for the protection of innocent, though misled, trustees.
The LORD CHANCELLOP said, that the noble and learned lord was right in supposing that Government intended to bring in the Bill next session on the subject of criminal breaches of trust, which would, if circumstances had permitted, been introduced in the present seosion. It was difficult to define what constituted a criminal breach of trust; but what had been done was to extend that denomination to certain defined breaches of trust, wilfully committed by the trustee for his own benofit. He did not measi to say that cases equally criminal might not be left untouched because of the impossibility of giving a definition to include them. With respect to the hardship that might affect innocent trustees for not having disoharged their duty whein they wisbed to do so, he feared that was a difficulty which it was impossible for the Legislature to meet.
Lord ST. LEONARD'S thought that the proposed Bill should be extended to any society taldng on itself the office of trustee and executor.
CHINA.
The Earl of HARDWICKE wished to press on the noble lord the Minister for War that the despatches from the naval commander in the Chinese waters should be made public, as it was customary to publish the despatches from commanders-in-chief with respect to naval actions fought. To-day, as usual, he had seen accounts from the correspondent of 2Pse Times, and also accounts in other papers, giving the whole history of the transactions which had taken place, and therefore he thought it not unfair to ask the Government whether those accounts contained a true story, because, to usea vulgar phrase,we had been " icked" if the published news were true. He put the question in that assembly, not from any feeling -f joy or exultation at an event of tha kdnd, but for the purpose of ascertaining whether thosa officers in whom the Government had put so much confidenco, whom they considered able and well informed on the character and power of the Chinese nation, and whom they were about to support with all the strength of the State, were really fit to conduct undertakings of this hind-whether they were sufficiently acquainted with the nature of the Chinese waters and properly appreciated the events which were likely to occur, and whether they deserved to be trusted to the extent to which they were trusted. The Duke of Wellington once observed of a distinguished individual, that he was a very clever man but never saw to the end of a campaign; and it certainly appeared to him that Sir J. Bowring had not shown that great prescience which he was supposed to have possessed with respect to the character and power of the Chinese nation. He pressed the Government for the production of despatches because, if the published statements were untrue, it would be a great satisfaction to their lordships to know so; and if on the other hand they were true, their lordships ought to be satisfied, or rather dissatisfied, by being made acquainted with the fact that those officers, who were so much trusted by the Government, had neitber the ability nor foresight to conduct operations of the kind in question.
Earl GRANVILLE said, he understood that the noble Secretary for Foreign Affairs had stated the other evening that there was no objection to the publication of the despatches desired by the noble earL He would make it his duty to inquire why they had not yet been produced. With respect to what had falen from the noble earl respecting the naval officers in the Chinese waters-
The Earl of HA.RDWICKE was understood to say that it was to Sir J. Bowring that he had referred.
Earl GRANVILLE really did think that Sir J. Bowring had been made to bear so much that it was not necessary to throw on his shoulders responsibility for inefficiency and want of judgment in conduoting naval operations (" Hear" and laughter), particularly as it appeared from the papers before Parliament that the instructions first given by Sir J Bowring were given with the full concurrence of Admirai Seymoar and Consul Parkes. For the course pursued there were precedents in the China Seas, for on two previous occasions the British authorities there did, with only two vessels, what had been done now, and then the mandarins complied with the demands made.
Earl GREY believed that every one of these expeditions, made with a small force against a nation so numerous as the Chinese, acquainted to a certain extent with the implements and materials of warfare, and daily improving in their knowledge of them, always had the effect of teach. ing them something more, and led to thec danger of collisions being repeated. (H ear, hear.) This was one of many other considerations which the Duke of Wellington felt strongly when he (Earl Grey) sent ont the orders in 1847 with the noble duke's concurrence. It was the opinion of the Cabinet of that day, not ouly that no subordinate authority should decide whether cause for offensive war had arisen Or not, but that, if cause had really arisen, it was the height of rashness and imprudence, without such preparation and means as would make resistance hopeless, to attempt hostilities. (FRear, hear.) It was only by acting on such a principle that it was likely that bloodshed would be prevented on one side, and, on the other, that the. risk of danger and discredit would be averted from this country. Ho asked whether the events which were now stated to have taken place did not afford a signal proof of the justice of this view of the question s (Hear.) What had happened? Admitting, for argunent'8 sake, the war to be just and politic-though he thought otherwise--yet it had been begun with inefficient means, so that, after burning 7,000 houses in a defenceless town, and after committing acts of violence and cruelty-for so he must cal them-on a defenceless population, the British forces were now reduced to a state of ignominious defence, waiting for reinforcements in order to enable further proceedings to be adopted. (Hear, hear.) T'his was placing the British nation in a position not at all creditable, and it arose from a sanction being given to the adoption of a course contrary to that ordered by successive Secretaries of State, and renewed so recently as 1853 by the Dtuke of Newcastle.
The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH believed that there was no dharge against the admiral. The charge against Sir J. Bowriug, the friend of the noble earl, was that be had entered upon this war without foreseeing the probableresults of the opposition that he would encoanter. The excuse of the noble earl was that other mandarins had been beaten by a smatler force, as if all mandarins, because they were alike in dress, had the same understanding. Sir J. Bowring ought to have Inown that al depended upon the individual character of the man who had the disposal of the Chinese military and naval forces. He knew the character of Com. missioner Yeh, and he must have known the weakness of character of the mandarin with whom Sir John Davis had to deal, and the course he should have pursued was precisely dissimilar to that which hc adopted.
Earl GRANVILLE said that the noble earl opposito had framed his argument upon the knowledge of the events to Which he had referred, while Sir J. Bowring had, of course, to form his judgment before the events occurred. His noble friend had certainly sent instructions to General lYAguilar not to repeat an attempt with an insufficient force, but if he was not rmistaken his noble friend had previously approved an atteapt which had happened to be successful. At the same time, he was not illogical in saying that it was not fair to put on Sir J. Bowring xclusively the odium,if any odium existed, of having mIisCalculated tho strength of the military and naval forces at his disposaL The frst duty of Sir J. Bow-
ring-was to consult the admiral, and to act upon the advise
he received from him as to tht disposition of the forces; and whaWver ridiculo might &atach to him for saying so, he was o£ o0nion that if a certain operation with a very inferior force had been successful under certain circumstances, some
encouragement was thereby afforded to create a belief that a similar proceeding ivitha stronger force wouldbe successful. He had the honour of the acepaintance of Sir J. Bowring, and,he cetriinly would not slil;hk from Qonsidering him as
his friend at a moment when he was subject to unjust and mntemperate attacks. (Hear, hear.)
Earl GREY.-H-is noble friend had said he bad approved a similar attempt made by General d'Aguilar. If his noble fliend vould read that despatch ke would find that it was cautiouly worded sol as to approve the manner in which a certain enterprisa was effected. He was careful to express no opmion upon tho prudence of theattempt, but he thought the troops were entitled to praise for the gallant manner in which they had conducted the operation. His opinion of the prudence of the measure was to be collected from the peremptory terms in which a repetition of any such attempt without a previous reference to the Rome Govern. ment was positively prohibited.
The Earl of DERBY said that although in a question of military and naval tactics the admiral and general would be the fittest judges, yet the question here turned upon very different considerations. The admiral had only recently arrived upon the station, and he knew nothiug and could know nothing whatever of the character, the disposition, and means of resistance which might be afforded by an exasperated population. Sir J. Bowring, on the contrary, had been a resident at Canton for many years, and it was but becoming and necessary in all matters involving the feelings and character of those people that the admiral should refer and defer to the advice and experience of Sir J. Bowring. Now, upon two points Sir J. Bowring had been proved to have made a gross miscalculation. Repeatedly, in the course of this correspondence, he inforned the Secretary of State that it was only necessary when this queation of entering into the city of Canton was mooted that we should make a demonstration, that such a demonstration would be at once successful, and that there was not the dightest reason for apprehending any disaster, the responsibility of which he expressed himself ready to take upon himself if he could only obtaia the desired per. mission. Successive Secretaries of State had refused to give him leave, but in defiance of them he had endeavoured to carry out his own views, and he could not now escape from the responsibility. Again, in the course of the correspondence that had been laid on the table, Sir J. Bowring had repeatedly asserted that the only objection to his entering the city was on the part of the mandarins, and that the Chinese population had no objection to it. If that were so at the commencement of these proceedings, there was the more reason to complain of the conduct of Sir J. Bowring in having converted a population who were friendly into the most bitter and resentful enemies that this country ever had. Those were the charges against Sir J. Bowring; and without considering the means at his disposal, and miscalculating the opposition he was likely to meet with, and of which the admiral could know nothing, he had taken upon himself the responsibility of disobeying his positive instructions, and ihad plunged the country into a war the end and cost of which no man could foretel.
Earl GRANIVLE said, there are now two different charges against Sir J. Bowrng. Their lordshipe must see the inconvenience of a debate which thus turned upon the character of an absent authority. (Hear.) The noble earl who first rose complained that our military operations had ended in' defeat, and that the admiral had been obliged to assume a defensive position.
The Earl of ELLENBOROUGH acknowledged that the debate was irregular, but he would not detain their lord. ships more than a moment. He believed that Sir J. Bowring held the position of commander-in-chief. He was not merely the Governor of Hongkong, but all the military and naval force were under his direction. No doubt it was his duty to communicate with the admiral and general with regard to any military and naval operations, but, having heard the opinion of those officers, Sir J. Bowring became responsible, not merely for what he ordered, but for what he permitted. He must exercise his own judgment, and it was not fair to go to a military or a naval man to divide the responsibilitywith him. Theycouldmake but one answer, and Sir J. Bowring must stand between them and the difficulty in which they were placed.
Lord PANNURE said that no doubt Sir J. Bowring, hlke the Governor-General of Canada, was the commander. in-chief of the forces. But what was the meaning of that? The meaning was, that if warlike operations were to be undertaken he was to decide what was to be done; but, as to the manncr and the mode in which the operations were to be conducted, he should like to know how it could Dcour to any man of sense that Sir J. Bowring at Hongkong could direct the operations at Canton? He did not wish to put upon Adrmiral Seymour any responsibility that ought to Eall upon Sir J. Bowring, but he must say that in carrying Dut the details of operations which had been arranged in a council of war, where the advice of Admiral Seymour had been called in, to throw the responsibility of those opera. tions entirely upon Sir J. Bowring's shoulders was scarcely fair. Admiral Seymour found himselfina narrow river with 3hips drawing a considerable draught of water, and assiled by ships that drew very little water, which were coming out both above and below him; and to say that, because Admiral 3eymour had quitted one position to take up a stronger posi. tion, the Britishforcehadbeen "licked,nwas quite contrary to lhe fact. Admiral: Seymourhad not been beaten. He had aken up a position necessary for the defence of his fleet. Ee had destroyed all the defences of the Chinese in thoee waters, and in neither of the positions that he had taken op had he shown any want of ability in guarding his ships from the attempts of the enemy to set them on fire. With reference to the position of affairs in the Canton river, one fact ought to be known to their lordships which was mentioned by Admiral Seymour in a letter written after his public despatch was sent off; it was to the effect that the Emperor had written to the Chinese officors at the four ports, directing them to remain on terms of peaceful and amicable relations with the English, notwithstanding what had happened at Canton.
The Earl ofl ELLENBOROUGH said, the statement he made the other day was founded on what appeared in the public papers-namely, that a fire-boat had blown up under the bows of one of Her Majesty's vessels. He stated that in his opinion no fire-boat ought to be allowed to come close enough for such an event to oecur. The noble lord was quite wrong in supposing a mere rowing guard would keep off fire-boats, and if he would take the trouble to read the despatehes written during the last war, under the direction of Sir George Cockburn and the Duke of Wellington, he would find there were more effectual means than that for protecting the fleet against fire-boats. It ought to be distinctly understood that there was no charge against Sir 1. Seymour for the manner ia which he had directed the force at his disposal. The charge was against Sir John Bowring for having undertaken the operations at all. (Hear, hear.)
The Marquis of BREADALBANE defended, upon high authority, the operations undertaken by Sir John Bowring and Sir MI. Seymour.
Lord COLCHESTER contended that Sir M. Seymour had acted wrongly under pressure put upon him by Sir J. Bowring, and that the latter only was to blame.
The subject then dropped.
Certain standing orders having been dispensed witb,
The Cornwall Railway Bill, Price's Patent Candle Company Bil, and the Whitehaven, Cleator, and Egremont failway Bill were read a second time.
The Customse Duties Bill, the Racehorse Duty Act Amendment Bill the Cinque Ports Act Amendment Bil, and the Pauper Maintenance Bill were read a second time.
The Commissioners of Supply (Scotland) Act 1856 Amendment Bill was read a third time and passed.
The Income-tax Bill, the Indemnity BiU, the Copyhold and Enclosure Commissions Bill, the Extra Parochial Places Bill, and the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Bill passed through committee.
TICKETS OF LEAVE.
Lord DUNGANNON, after expressing a strong opinion that the ticket-of-leave system was a source of crime and a cause of danger to the peaceable part of the community, asked the Lord Privy Seal whether that system was suspended or would be suspended until means were devised for otherwise disposing of convicts?
The Earl of E OWBY said, that tickets of leave would be granted, but only to a very limited number of con. victs. The Government intended to re-introduce the Bill
recently withdrawn, for the consideration of the new Par. Iiament.
THE CHINESE EXPEDMON.
The Mfarquis of CLANRICARDE inquired of the Secretary of State for War what pay and allowanes the officers and soldiers about to be sent to China were to receive; and 'whether he would lay upon the table of the House an estimate or return showing the comparative cost of the British regiments serving in the Persian Gulf and upon the Coist of China? He (the Marquis of Clanricarde) understood that the troops about to serve in China were not likely to receive such high pay as the troops serving in the Persian Gulf; and he could not understand upon what ground tho distinc. tion was to be made, seeing that the troops about to proceed to China were embarking upon an enterprise fraught with danger to their lives and health, and one in which there would be as little excitement or hope of glory as any in which British troops could be employed. The noble earl
opposite (Ellenborough), the other night, had alluded to the, camp followers in India. He (the Marquis of Clanrioardp) confessed he was igaorant of the necessity of attaching camp followers to the English troops on their arrival in China, but he had no doubt such necessity existed, inasmnuch as their services appeared always to have been in requisition. Be that as it might, he should be glad to hear from his noble friend the Secretary of State for War a reply to the ques.. tions he had put to him. -
Lord PANMURE.- My noblefriend is quitc Sight in one respect. There is a differenceebetween the piy of the troops serving in the Persian expedition and that of the trcops
about to be sent outin tho expedition to China. The trosp3 serving in the Persian expedition are drawn from the Indian establishment, and have been receiving the regular pay and allowances assigned to troops belonging to the East India Company; but the troops going from this country to Chin., are in a different position. They are now going on an expedition from this country, which is to be Iaid for out of the funds of this country, and they vidl not be pot on the same pay and allowances astheEastIndia Company assigns to their troops serving- within their own territories. The troop; will receive the usual pay, and every precaution besides will be taken that their rations-which will be above what are called the ordinary rations in time of war-are prepartd and served with a view to the maintenance of their health; but there wilt be no increase of pay to the troops absolutely. With reference, however, to the officers, there is by the regulations an allowance called an " extraordinary field allowance," which every officer receives in advance, preparatory to taking the field. The officers will receive six months of this extraordinary field allowance, which wvil enable them to prepare for taking the field. But in Hongkong there is a colonial allowance, as at the Mauritius and Ceylon paid to the troops serving in that colony, and on arriving at Hongkong that will be made good to the troops going out on this expedition, so as to place them in the same pDosition as the troops nowserving at Hongkong. These are our intentions with regard to the troops about to serve in the Chinese expedition, and 1 shall have no objection to lay upon the table a return of the nature for which the noble marquis has asked, I have only to add that, while this expedition will be conducted with a due regard to economy, every attention will be at the same time paid to the health of the troop; and to their maintenance in a state of efficiency, and, for that purpose, the Government has resolved that, as the troops will land in China when the hot weather wvil prevail, an adequate number of camp-followers from India shall be attached to them, and General Ashburnham has been instructed to apply his Indian experience in apportioning those camp-followers among the troops on their arrival at Rongkong. In addition to that, arrangements will be made at Penang for conveying the sick by means of steam vessels between Hongkong and that station; and I trust that every 'precaution will be taken to prevent that sacrifice of life from disease which unfortunately happened among the troops during the former expedition to China. (Hear, bear.)
The Earl of ELLENBOROUGIL-With respect to the camp-followers, the noble marquis (Clanricarde) wilL perhaps, by this time be satisfied of the necessity of attaching them to the expedition. Among those camp-followers there are people caled cooks, who, according to our notions, are certainly a necessary class of persons (a laugh), and water-carriers, who may be said to be invaluable. I should observe, also, that camp followers contribute considerably to the efficiency of a regiment, inasmuch as all these duties must be performed by the soldiers if not performed by them. From what fell from the noble baron, I understand that, with trau English feeling, he is abont to supply the troops going to China with more to eat. Now, from considerable experience of hot climates, I can assure him that that is the very worst thing he can do (a laugh); that in such climates the less a man eats the better, and that what the noble baron proposes will be the greatest mistake he ever committed. I can assure the noble baron that, if he ever went to India, it would be quite impossible for him to take that indalgence in the way of living which I dare say he takes now without the slightest harm. (Laughter.) Passing from this, it appears to me that the Government are porsuing a course strictly legal; but, at the same time, I venture to represent that these officers will have to incur a great expense in fitting themsdves out for this war. They will be required to prepare not for garrison duty only but for actual warfare-- warfaxe, too, in which many things willbe necessary which may be dispensed with in aEuropean contest. If, therefore, any indulgence can be extended to them consistent with theinterests of the service, and not leading to the establishment of aninconvenient precedent, it would bo most desirable that such indulgence should be granted, (Hfear.) Before sitting down I wish to call the attention of the noble earl the President of the Council to an expression which fell from him last night with reference rather to France than to China, and which surely must have escaped him inadvertently. The noble earl stated that the relations between this country and France waro never of a more friendly character, and he expressed great satisfaction that French troops would again co-operate with our own in China. Now, I imagine the word "troops" must have been used inaccurately, and that the noble earl only alluded to a marine force But, my lords, I most deeply regret that there is to be any co-operation whatever. (Hear, hear.) We know nothing of any quarrel which the Emperor of the French has with the Emperor of China. (Hear, hear.) We know that we have none with the Emperor of China, (Hear, hear.) Our quarrelisat prosent confined to the Cantonese and to Commissioner Yeh, and nothing could be so inconvenient, so inconsistent with justice and with policy, as to extend that quarrel to the Emperor of China, and to light up a war in all the other ports as well as in that of Canton. (Hear, hear.) My lords, I deprecate the intervention of France at this momentWhy should she take advantage of the difficulty in which wo are placing China in order to obtain for herself terms to which she is not entitled? (Hear.) Thereisnoprotoncefor sach intervention, andl eanhardlyimagineexpressions which I should think too strong to apply to the conduct of our Government if we were to take advantage of a disposition on the part of France thus to interfere for her own purposes in order to obtain the assistance (of most questionable value) which would be afforded by the presence of a French squadron in the Chinese waters. (Hear, hear.) We desire peace; we desire the re-establishment of friendly relations - we do not desire to extort new terms from the Emperor of China; we desire only to stand where we were, and to relieve ourselves from the difficulties in which Governor Bowrng has plunged us. (Hear, hear.) There is one other point upon which I feel very strongly, and upon which i must venture to offer what can only be a suggestion to Her Majest's Government, because I have not that knowledge of tho facts which they possess, and which may lead them, possibly, to a different conclusion. I regret the accidental absence of the noble earl the Foreign Secretary, because what I am about to say relates perhaps more particularly to his department. We have now a force at Bushire which is amply suifficient for the protection of that place. A force of about the same strength has been despatched from Bombay, and has not yet arrived. These troops, I imagine, were not intended to strengthen the garrison in Bushire, already sufficient, but to conduct some new operation. Whatevor was the course ofproceedingedtermined on, the force in question isobviously not required at Bushire. There, as I understood the noble earl (the Earl of Clarendon) no movement was to take place on either side until the ratification of the treaty. MTat new force therefore can not move at Bushire, and can do nothing whatever. Now, I beg to suggest to the Government that they should instantly send positive orders to Bushire to despatch one European regiment and two native regiments of that force to China. The presence of those troops may be absolutely required for the protection of bingapore and Hongkong. I feel satisfied that without the assistance of native troops, the efforts, however gallant they may be, if the European troops we are sending will be of little or no avail, and that great risk wil be encountered with little chance of success. These ordersabsolute orders, leaving no discretion whatever to the officer in command, for I feelperfectly satisfied that if the least discretion were left to him he would keep the troops with him-would arrive at Bushire hence, I trust, in a month, and in a month from that time those troops would be at Singapore and Hongkong. On the other hand the troops we are now sending out will not arrive in China 'for three months and a-half, and the gain in these six weeks may be invaluable for the protection of our interests. (Hear, hear.) There may be circumstances with which Iam unacquainted which may render inexpedient this movement. X venture only to suggest it to the Government as a measure which, in my opinion, should be instantly adopted. (Hear, hear.)
Lord PANKURE.-1 have to thank the noble earl for his suggestion. In all these matters he has given many valuable hints, some of which I have availed myself of, and I am surethat the counsel he tenders is offeredwith no other desire than that of being usefuL With reference to the rations of the troops alluded to by the noble earl, I will just state that the object is not to increasc the quntitve
served out to the troops to eat and drink, but to diversify their food so asto conduce more completely to their heath and efficiency.
Earl GRBY.-I confess that I have listened with some alarm to tbe conversation which has taken place this eveningB When first it was announced that this force was to be sent out we were told that it was to protect the lives and property Of British subjects in China. It now appears that a very large Iforco is going to be sent, and that this force (if I correctly understand what has been said) is to be equippedin a manner which shall enable them to undertake operations of somo importance on shore. Now, I do hope and' trust we are not going to embark in that most dangerous and fatal measure-an invasion of the great empire of Chine. (Hear, hear.) I hope that Her Majesty's Government, in pursuing tho measures which they are now taking, have some clear and definite object before them, because as far as we are yet informed, no such object appears to bein view After all, my lords, what do we want with China ? Onr interest in China is simply to carry on our trade. (Hear.) If we are to embark in a war, every blow wbich we inflict on China, will recoil upon ourselves. (H_ear, bear.) We cannot destroy property in China, we can. not burn towns there and lay waste, or cause others to lay waste, any portion of territory, withont, by such a destruction of Chinese property, rendering them worse customers of ours and less able to supply us with the goods we want from them. (Hear.) We were told at first tbat British lives and British property only were to be protected. Fo4 my own paet I. confess that, with a very large naval
force, and X certain amount of military force also, I canno' conceive how British property can be in any danger. Hongkong is an island very essily defended, for the Chinese are totally incapable of competing with Us at sea; Singapore is in the same pogition; and, at the four ports, I trust that ifPprudential meanres are adopted anything like a struggle willbe avoided. Of this, however, lam quito certain, that if we are to attempt anything like an invasion of China, we are at the beginning of a system which, once entered upon, it 'will be very difficult to pnt a stop to, and which will be most fatal to the true interests of this country. (Hear, hear.)
Earl GlANVI=LE.-I really think that in my noble friend's very earnest and conscientious wish to preserva peace he sometimes overlooksl the most obvious means of arriving at that end. I cannot imagine any of your lordships will believe that the plenipotentiary whom Her Majesty's Government have determined to send out to re-establish satisfactory relations between the two countrieS is less likely to accomplish that object if backed up by a considerable naval and military force. As to my affording any intimation with regard to the instructions which will be given to the commanders of this force, I am sure my noble friend will, upon reflection, be the last to press me to make any such disclosure.
The conversation was not further pursued.
THE OPIUM TRAFFIC.
Iord SHAFTESBITRY presented petitions against the opiumtrafficfrom Shewvsbury, KirkSession of Dundonald(2), farmers, &c., ditto (20, Baptist Mtissionary Society, merchants and traders of Irvine, Aberdeen Mfedical Mlission Society, public meeting at FreemasonsJ-hall, Bourton, county of Warwick, Leominster, Weobly, Htereford, and Rugby.
Earl GRANVILLE hoped their lordships would have no objection to depart from thelr usual custom, and meet to. morrow (Wednesday) for the despatch of business.
Their lordships then, at half-past 60o'clock, adjourned until this day (Wdnesday) at noon.

PETIlIONS.
The SPEAIE took the chair shortly before 4 o'clock.
Petitions were presented by MIr. HARDY, from the inhabitants of Wibsey, Yorkshire, in favour of the Sale of Beer Bill; and by Mr. H. GoBE LANSOTON, from a public meeting of the inhabitants of Bristol, in favour of the ballot.
CLLFORDYS LIFBBOAT APPAR&TUS.
Admiral WALCOTP asked the First Naval Lord of the Admiralty whether the same protection against loss of life afforded to emigrant ships had been or would be provided for the ships about to embark troops for China, by supplying them with Clifford's lifeboat apparatus, which had been subjected to the severest tests from Her Majesty's ships under different circumstances of weather, and at every rate of speed, and of the complete efficincy of which reports had been forwarded to the Admiralty.
Admiral BERKELEY said tLat, had his hon. and gallant friend given him notice of this question, he would have brought with him a list of the ships which had been fitted with this apparatus. He could only say that in every trial which had becn made of it, its use had been attended w,ith complete success.
GRAND JURIES (IRELAND) BILL
On the motion of Mr. Bowvxa, the order for the further proceeding with this bill was read and discharged.
THE CRTItAN COMMISSIONERS.
Viscount CASTLEROSSE, Controller of the Household, appeared at the bar in the Windsor uniform, and delivered H er Majesty's answcr to the address agreed to by this House on Thursday evenfing last with regard to the services of 1Sir Jobn M'Neil and Colonel Tulloch. The answer was aa follow/s>
"I have received your address, praying that some special mark of approbation may be conferred upon Sir John M'Neill and Colonel TuDoch, in consideration of the able services rendered by them as commissioners to the Crimea - and having taken the same into consideration, I have given directions for this purpose."
THE APPELLATE JURISDICTION OF THE HOUSE
OF LORDS.
Mr. BOWYER, who, to put himself in order, moved the adjournment of the House, caled attention to the state of the appelate jorisdiction, as exemplified in the ca.e of "Grey and others against Pearson," which was decided by the House of Lords on the previous day. In that case a decree made by Vice-Chancellor, nowv Lord Justice, Turner had been varied by the Lord Chancellor; the parties had appealed to the Hiouse of Lords, and the decision of the Lord Chancellor had been confrmed by himself and Lord Wensleydale agains the authority of Lord St. Leonard's, who differed from them. Thus the decision of two eminent equity judges had been set at nought by one equity judge, assisted by a common law e dge who had never sat or practised in a court of equity. Te would ask the right hon. baronet the Home Secretary whether, under these circumstances, the Government were not of opinion that much remained to be done before the appellate jurisdiction of the House of Lords would be in such a state as the wants of the country and the adminis. tration of justice required; and whether he would next session bring forward a measure for the constitution of an apopellate court of ultimate resort which should be fully adequate to the performance of its important duties ?
Sir G. GREY said that this case, as stated by the hon. and learned member, seemed to be the ordinary instance of a case decided by a majority of two judges against one. That was not an unusual occurrence in courts of appeal and he did not think that the House would usefully occupy its time by discussing the merits of particular judges and endeavouring to provide that, contrary to the general rule, the opinion of one judge should prevail against those of two others. So far as he was concerned, he did notth}nk that the circumstances of this case rendered necessary any interference with the appellate jurisdiction of the House of Lords.
'Jr. BOWYER explained that he did not complain of the decision of the House of Lords being given by the majority; he complained that the decision was made by an equity judge sitting on appeal from himself with a common law judge who never practised or sat in a court of equity, against the opinion of two great eauity judges, one in the House and the other in the Court below. The casting vote Fas given by a common law judge.
The motion for the adjournment of the House was then withdrawn.
TEE; REMOVAL OF IRISH PAUPERS.
Mr. H. HERBERT asked the President of the Poor Law Board whether his attention had been called to the circumstaunces of the removal of a female pauper, named Honora Brosnahan, and her children, from the Eolborn Union to Ireland; whether he had reason to believe that the said Honora Bronsahan's husband was born in England - and whether any remedy exists by the present law for tlhe in. justice inflicted on the woman herself, and on the Tralee
nion in Ireland, to which she has been removed 2
Mr. BOUVERIE 3aid that he had inquired into this matter, and he was informed by the guardians of the Hol. born Union that this woman was removed with her own consent, and that before her removal she said not a word to them about her husband having been born or having acquired a settlement in this country. Even had she made such a statement it would have been no evidence of the sotNlement. He might add that this was exactly one of the cases for which he sought to provide by the Bill which he introduced last session, but which did not receive the ap. proval of the House.
WINE D1UTIES.
Mlr. OLIVEIRA, who had given notice that he would move for a select committee to inquire into the practicabihty of reducing the duty on forelgn wines, stated that it was not his intention to proceed with his motion during the present Parliament.
LAND TRANSPORT CORPS.
Mr. T. DUNCOMBE also withdrew his motion for a committee on this subject, on account of the present state of public affairs. He understood that the grievances to inquire into which he had asked for this committee were now under the consideration of the War Department, by whom he hoped they would be satislactorily adjusted. He also wished to observe that a copy of the oraers in Council for the disbanding of the Land Tran~ort Corps bad not yet been laid upgon the table in complhance with a resolution of the
Sir G. GREY promised that the returns in question should be presented in a day or two.
THE SOUND DUES.
Mr. BRAMLEY-MOORE rose to call the attention of the House to the subject of the Sound dues, and to ask the Chancallor of the Exchequer whether a treaty had been signed to ca'italize those dues and indemnify Denmark for pVngV up her reputed rights; also, whether it was the intention of Her Majestys Government that the treaty should be acted upon before Parliament had voted the money for this object? The whole of the witnesses examined before the committee which sat on this question, with scarcely an exception, were parties deeply interested in the abolition of these dues, and that they should be capital. izea and paid out of the consolidated fund. The amount required for this purpose would probably reach 1,000,000l. sterling, and before the country was committed to so heavv an expenditure the House ought to be furnished with proer information on the subject. These dues were of suCh great antiquity that their origin could hardly be traced. Down to theyear 184 however, they were subjected to successive revisions ana reductions. These dues were hypothecated to a loan of several millions in London, and before the House sanctioned this treaty they ought to know how the money was to be appropriated. Was the ealculation on which the proposed iApitahi7ation was to be founded based on aprospectiveincreoseordecreaseofthetrade? Sineethe repe of our navigation laws in 1849our trade in this quarter hadbeen gradually and constantlydiminir,hing,Ju I89 the number of British vessel thatpassed the Sound was 6,876; Inl8d0 it was 5,464; in 1851, 4,794; in 1855 3,202 ; in 185, 4,654; and in 1854, 2,000. It was hardly fAir to carry the fires further, on account of th interraption cauted to our commerce by the war; but it was necessary to caution the Houise against being led away by the statemnent masde by tha Chancellor of
teExchequer, In introducing his budget, as to the prosperity of the pping interest. The right lbon. gentleman said that there hAd been a large increase in thle amount of British tonngoe between the years 1853 and 1856, and a small increase in foreign tonnage within the same e Oad. There was considerable ingenmty in the selection oa these two years for the purpose of comparisn, because the first of themnwas the date at which British tonnage was at itg lowest ebb since the repeal of the navigation laws. If the right bon. gentlemulald quoted the year 1849 he would have found that betveen that period and 1853 ibere had been a decrease of 220,000 tons; and that, even with tbe advantage of the increased tonnage of vessels coming home
from the war, there had been an increase of foreign tonnage in this kingdom of 180 per cent., and an increase of British tohnage of only 33 pef cent in 1856, as compared with 1849. Nearly thoe wole of the comiplaint made against these does applied not to their pecuniary amount but to the delays incident to their collection. This defay was already obviated in the case of steamer, wbich were not detained at all, but merely delivered their papers and paid the dues when they arrived at their port of discharge. A similar arrangement for the benefit of sailing ships might easily be ma,e by treaty with Denmark, and then tho dues, whether light or heavy, would fall on those who ought to bear them. The propowed treaty was to come into operation on the 1st of April next, and the House vwa tberefore entitled to receive satisfactory infornation on the subject before the country vas committed to the paynent of a large sm of money. The hon. memberooncluded by moving for the production of the papers relating to the treaty with Denmark on the Sonund dues
Mr. LIDDELL wished to know whether the treaty included the redemption of the transit dues levied by the Danish Government, and whether it was correct that only four-fifths of those dues were to bo remitted.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUlER said that the evidence taken by the committoe of last session showed most conclusively that the Sonud dues were onerous to navigation and detrimental to the trade of this country with the Baltic, not only on account of the sums which were levied upon ships passing through the Sound, but also by reason of the delays which they occasioned, and the additional charges incidental on those delays. It had been admitted on all hands for some years that if these dues could be extinguished by some sort of equitable redemption the change would be beneficial, and, in consequence of a question raised by the Government of the United States, negotiations had been going on during the last 12 months between the Danish Government and the Governments of all the principal States of Europe for the redemption of these dues. On the 14th of tho present month two treaties had been signed at Copenhagen the first between the Government in Denmark ana the Governments of Russia, Prussia, France, Great Britain and other States, which contained the general stipulations refesring to all these States, and the other between the Governments of Great Britain and Denmark, which contained the particular stipulations affecting these two countries. Her Majesty's Government only knew of the signature of these treaties by a telegraphic despatch, and at present they had no copy of them as they were signed, bat from the draughts in the possession of the Government, which he believed to be identical with the treaties signed, though, of course, he could not pledge himself that such was the case, he would shortly state 'what the effect of these treaties was. By the second article of the general treaty the Sound dues were to expire on the 1st of April next, tho amount of compensation to be paid by each Stete was fixed by the 4th article, the 7th article made the execution of the treaty dependent upon the sanction required by the constitutional laws of the respective countries, and the 8th article stipulated for ratification in the usual manner. By the separate convention it was provided that the amount of compensation to be paid by this country should be paid, in the event of the assent of Parliament being given to it, within three months after the passing of the requisite Act of Parliament. Although an early date bad been fixed for the opening of the Sonud, in order to meet the convenience of those Staxtes which had no Parliamentary Government, and were there fore able to pay their stipulated amount of compensation without consultin
any legidative body, the Danish Government, by a protocol sipged on the 16th of February retained the right of maintang a sort of status quo until the engagements of the 7th and 8 rticles of the general treaty were fulfilled. This was done by taking a securty from the vessels passing throuh the Sound for the eventual payment of the dues in case the arrangement made by the treaty was not sanctioned. The faith of Parliament was in no way engaged by the arrangement, and whatever chance might take place upon the 1st of April tbe next Parliament would be left quite free to come to whatever decision it might think fit. It would be the duty of the Government to lay the whole subjeet before Parliament at the earliest period, to explain on what grounds the negotiations had been carried on, and to sggest such means as it might think most advisable to earry out the arrngements arrived at. He was not awsare that the treaty contained any engagement with respect to the loau. That was a matter between the Danish Government and the bondholders, and it would not be competent for the British Government to make any stipulation on the subject. As to the transit duesce believed that four-fifths of them were to be remitted. le was not in a position to give the details of the stipuLations on that point, but the proper time to explain the gromund on which that arrangement was made would be when the treaty was before the House.
Sir HE WILLOUGHBY-What is tho amount of compensation which this country has undertaken to pay?
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER-Our share amounts to 1,125,2064
The motion was then withdrawn.
THE BRIMSH BANK.
Sir F. iELLY asked what were the intentions of the Government with respect to the measure of which they had given notice in reference to the British Bank.
The ATTORNEY-GENERAL very much regretted that the sudden termination of the session had prevented him bringing in two Bills-one withregardto fraudulent breaches of trust, Iwhich he hoped wonld be a means of punishin
such delinquencies as had been exhibited in the case of the British Bank; and the other to remedy tho disbss which had been occasioned to the shareholders in the Drocess of winding up that bank The whole case of the Brftish Bank was an opprobrium to British jurispradence, inasmuch as it had exhibited the inability of the law to punish this class of offenders, and theutter incompetenco of the tribunal which had attempted to windu p the affairs of the bank. In the next Parliament it would be his desire to bring these two measures forward at the earliest posdble period.
The Speaker's Retirement Bill passed through committee.
The Exchequer-bills (21,049,7006) BiU and the Consolidated Appropriation Fund Bill went through committee.
?I[UTINY BILL.-AFFATRS OF ITALY.
On the order of the day for considering the Mutiny Bill as amended,
Mr. DISRAELI said-I wish to take this opportunity of making an inquiry of the noble lord at the head of the Government, which I was prevented from maklng at the commencement of businesw, with reference to some papers which were laid upon the table early in the session. The papers to which I refer are those connected with the oeom. munications between Her Majesty's Government and the Court of the Two Sicilies. Those papers vere of a very meagre character,andanhon. gentleman inquiredof thenoble lord whether-they contained the whole of the correspondence between Her Majesty's Government and the Government of the Two Sicilies with regard to the questions at issue between them. The noble lord stated that the pagers did notecontain all the correspondence, but that the correspondence omitted referred to a proposition which had led to no result, and that it was therefore mnneceseary to place it upon the table. I find, however, from the foreign journals, and from an English journl, that foreigners and the public out of doorsare more favourel than the members of the House of Commons, for the correspondence which was omitted from the papers laid upon the table appears to have transpired, and portions of that correspondence have been published. I wish to address a question to the noble lord with respect to one of the allegations contained in that correspondence. It is stated that Her Majesty's Government made an offer to a foreign Power to undertake that in case there was any attempt to establish republican institations in the south of Italy they would prevent the establishment of sueh institations evea, if necessary, by force of arms. Now, what I wish to know is whether there is any authority for that statement,whether it bo true that a communication of that character, or in that spirit, was made to any forelgn Power by the noble lord's Government; and I hope he wil give to that question a frank, and not a technical answer.
Lord PALMEBSTON.-The right hon. gentleman has not represented quite correctly the statement I made on a former occasion. What I then said was that the papers laid upon theotable contained everything that bore upon the couse of policy which Her Majesty's Government had adopted, but that certain instructions had been given to our mission at NZaples as to the courso to be pusued under contingenies which had not happerod, and that as those contingencies had not occurred the instractions fell to the ground, and there was no necesity for acting npon them. I did not refer to communicutions made to Her Maesys Government, but to instructions from Her Majestys Government to their own agent at Naples. I stated that other instractions had been given upon matters which were totally unimportant, and which had no referenceto the questions at isse. I understand the right hon. gentleman wishes to know whether the British Government
made any saggestion to a foreign Government that if an
attempt should be made to establish Republican institutions in Italy the British Government ought to oppose such a movement by force of arms. Am I correct in so understanding the right hon. gentloman ?
Mtr. DISRAELL- wish to be distinctly understood. Lord PALMERSTON.-It is important to be exact.
Mr. DISRAELL-What I wish to know is whether, in the course of comm unications which took place with reference to the affirs of Sicily , Her Msaests Government made any offer to a foreign rower that if an attempt were made to establish Republican institutions in Southern Italy they were prepared to interfere-if necessary even by force of arms-to prevent the establishment of such institutions.
Lord PALMERSTON.-No such offer was made by Her Majesty's Government.
Mr. G. DUNCAN expressed his satisfaction with the clause in the Mutiny Bill which exempted private house. holders in Scotland from the burden of having soldiers billeted upon them, and urged that where barrack accommodation exised the same relief should be extended to inn. keepers and publicans.
r.A. INNAIRD and Mr. W. EvAART made a few observations to the same effect.
Sir W. CODRINGTON remkrked that if the power of billeting soldiers were abolished it would be impossible to momo troops through the country.
Lord PALMERSTON said that in consequence of a discussion Which took place. asit session the Government had 'placed Scotland on the sanie footing as England with respect to the bieting of soldiers, -They v were now asked, how-
ever, to extend to innkeepers and publicans the same relief which had been granted to the occupiers of private houses. He admitted that where barrack accommodation existetcl and where there was a large number of troops requiring to be lodged, billets should not be given upon publioliousc ex. cept in cases of absolute necessity; but tbat was a matter of arrangement by the military departments, and not a sqbz ject for leral enactment. It might be a question whether
D Inglan as well as in Scotland the allowanco granted to innkeepers should not be increased. The Government were anxious to increase the amount of barrack accommodation, but they had been obliged to postpone that and many other arrangements for the convenience of the public service, i# order to enable the Chancellor of the Exchequer to brine expenditure within the limits of income. He was sure thas his noble friend Lord Panmure, upon application made to him, would be glad to place as many troops in barracks an possible, and thus to lessenthe pressure, if anyexistd, upon innkeepers and publicans.
AFFAIRS OF ITALY.
Mr. HENLEY.-I wish to recall the attention of the noble lord to the question of my right hon. friend the meij. ber for Buckinghamshire respecting the affairs of Italy. The noble lord answered the question of my right hon. friend by stating that the instructions sent to the British agent in Naples had reference to certain contingencies which did not happen, and, when pressed to give a categorical answer to the question whether Her Majesty's Government had made an offer to any foreign Power to interfere, by forc of arms if necessary, for the purpose of preventing the esta blishment of Republican institutions in the eouth of Italy, the noble lord replied that no such offet was made to any Foreign Power. But he left the im. pression upon my mind-I do not know whether the noble lord meant it or not-that some of those com% munications which were made to the British agent in Naples, with respect to certain contingencies which did not occur, did actually contain such an offer from our Government. Under these circumstances I am anx oujAo give the noble lordan opportunity of correcting the imprwsionwhichl his statement made upon my mind, if it be an erroneous one.
Lord PALMIERSTON.-I am obliged to the right hon. gentleman, if such an impression prevails, for giving me ari opportunity of removing it. What I said was that the instructions sent to the British agents had reference to the conduct wvhich they should pursue Ein the event of certa overtures being made to them by the Neapolitan Govern. ment. Those overtures never were made, and the instruc. tions forwarded to our agents had no relation whatever to the contingency of Republican institutions being established. We merely said, " If the Neapolitan Government make an offer to do so and so, you are to actso and so ;" but, no suc}t offerhaving been made, the contingency to which the instruac
tions applied did not arise, and the instructions had
oithnng to do with the establishment of Republcan institu. tions. I am quite sure that both the right hon. gentlement opposite must feel that the British Government never would thinkof interposing by force of arms to prevent the establishment of any form of government which the people of any foreign country might be pleased to adopt. (Hear, hear.) In such a case we should, of course, have onr opinion as to what would be most desirable; but that opinion we should not think ourselves entitled to enforce by an appeal to arms. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. DISRAEUT-Do I distinctly understand the noble lord to state-it is well to be candid in these matters-that no communications took place between the Government ot which he is chief and auy foreign Power in which the con. tingency of Republican institutions being established In Italy was contemplated, and the course which Her Majesty's Government under that contingency were prepared to pursuo was expressed?
Lord PALMERSTON.-That is a totally differeat ques. tion. ("Hear, hear," and a laugh.) The right hon. gentle. man asked me vwhether any offer had been made by the British Government to co-operate with any foreign Power in preventing the establishment of Republican institutions in Italy.
Mr. DISRAELI.-I asked whether any offer had been made to a foreign Power, but I did not say a word about co-operation.
Lord PALM:EBSTON.-Well, any offer to a foreign Power to do something, and that, too, if necessary, by force of arms. I repeat, no communication has been made to any foreign Power that we would prevent the establishment of Republican institutions in Italy.
The subject then dropped, and the Mutiny Bill was ordered to be read the third time to-morrow.

*&OIBY-MABKBTand CITYINTgLLIq1Er.&.
Tueaday Evening. I The quotation of gold at Paris is about 6 per mlle premium, and the short exchange on London Isv25.25per1. sterling. On comparigcthese rates' Wmith the Enoglish Mint price of 31. los. 10nd. ser oune for steandard gold, it appears that gol is.
early -lOths per cent, dearer in Paris thaniin l;ondon.
By advnces from Hamburg the price of gold is 424 per mark, and the short exchange on London is lS.4;t per 11. sterling. Standard gold at the English 3dint price is therefore about 1-lOth per cent.
dearer in Hamburg than in London.!
The course of exchange at New York on London for bills at 60 days' sight is 108 per cent., which, 'when compared with the Mint par between the two eountries, shows that the exchange is against Eng-
land; but, after making allowance for charges of! transport and difference of interest, the present rate: leaves no profit on the transmission of gold either; way between England and America.
The English funds remain totally without animation, and have closed this evening at a further decline of an eighth. The first price of Consols for money was 93 to i, and there were afterwards sellers at 93. They then again touched 93k, but the final quotations were 93 for money and 934 to a for the 8th of April. Money was in increased demand, owing to the settlement of the foreign account, and 6 per cent. was the lowest charge for loans on Government securities, some considerable amounts having been taken from the Bank at that rate. The market generally presents an extremely dull appearance, but it is in some measure supported by the prospect of the effect to be produced by the paying off of two millions of Exchequer-bonds on the 8th of May next. India Stock left off at 221 to 223;
adia-b,cds, 4s. discount to par; Exchequeribonds, 98 to ; and Exchequer-bills, is. discount to 2s. prenm.unm.
The demand for discounts to-day, both In the open market and at the Bank of England, was remarkably heavy.
Foreign securities have been steady, with a moderate amount of business, the arrangement of the half-monthly account occupying the attention of the dealers. The advance in Mexican continues to be hupported, the operations for money having been at 23i and ; and for the account, 23g. In Turkish the transactions were in the Six per Cents., for money, at 971 and i; and for the account at 981 and 97I. The Four per Cents. Guaranteed were negotiated at 100I and i. The general business comprised-Peruvian Three per Cents., 55; Portuguese Three per Cents., 43;
,ussian Five per Cents., 107i; Sardinian Five per Cents., 91; Spanish Three per Cents., 4] ; Spanish Certificates of Coupon not funded, 6i; Dutch Twoand-a-Half per Cents., 65; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 981.
In the foreign exchanges this afternoon the rates generally were a shade higheL.
The final prices of the French Three per Cents, on Thie Paris Bourse this evening were 70f. 90c. for money and 71f. 15e. for the end of the month, showling a reaction of an eighth.
It transpired to-day that the Joint-Stock Establishment known as the London and Eastern Banking Corporation have found it necessary to mnake arrangements for winding up their transactions. The concern was established only three years backv with a capital of 500,0001., of which one-half was paid up, and it has declared dividends at the rate of 6 per cent. It had branches in Mark-lane, Pall-mall, and Westbourne-terrace, as well as at Calcutta and Bombay. It is announced on authority that all the engagements will be liquidated in full as they fall due, and a hope is entertained by Mr. Coleman the accountant called in, that a considerable porion of the capital may be ultimately saved for the shareholders.
It is stated from Acapulco that the Trincomalee, whiclh was expected to take a large freight of silver from the West Coast of Mexico to Panama, would catry only 40,0001., owing to the quantities now sent direct to China or to San Francisco to be transmitted to China.
The Dunbar, from Sydney, has brought only 5,060 otunces of gold, valued at 20,0001.
The advices from Sydney to-day by the Dunbar reach to the 2Gth of December and describe no material alteration in any of the markets. From Melbourne the accounts reported an advance in the price of gold consequent upon a rise of one cent. in the rate of exchange. The total amount brought by escort to that port during the year just ending had been 10,100,0001., while the shipments, which more accurately represent the aggregate production, since, in addition to the sunDs by escort, larae quantities are brought to the city by private hands, had reached 11,6O,0001. The receipts for the past week had been unusually large, and the mail ship Orwell, the Brilliant, and the White Star were expected to take heavy remittances. The plan of the Government for establishing a national bank for Victoria continued to be the principal theme of discussion. It was popular with the public, but would be warmly opposed by all the existing banks. Annexed are the resolutions on the subject about to be submitted by the Colonial Treasurer to the House of Assembly, from which it appears that it is contemplated to vest the issuing power in three commissioners, independent of the Government, who shall also have the custody of the public balances, and who may purchase Government securities against one-half of the notes issued and balances held. They likewise provide that in case the Government of the adjoiinog colony of New South Wales should impose an export duty on gold similar to that established in Victoria the sovereigns of the Sydney Mint shal then be received at the Bank at the fixed price of 31. 14s. per ounce. This arrangement, however, is to be conditional on the Sydney sovereigDs being admitted as a legal tender in the United Kingdom-a position to which they are entitled in reason, but which has hitherto been refused theni. The private bank circulation is to be prohibited from increase during a certain interval, yet to be fixed, and at a later date it is to be suppressed, a quarterly tax of a half per cent. being meanwhile levied on their average issues:-
"RESOLUTIONS TO BE PROPOSED IN SELECT COsrTTEr
os BANKiNG.
1. That it would be for the public advantage that no notes payable on demand should be in circulation except such as might be a legal tender.
* 2. That it would be for the public advantage that the power of issuing bank notes should be vested in one insti. tution, established by the State, and not carrying on ordinary banking business.
"*3. That it would be for the public advantage that the balances of the consolidated revenue and other funds in the hands of the Treasurer of Victoria and of publio accountants should be employed in reduction of the public debt.
" 4. That it would be for the public advantage that an office should be established in Victoria, in connexion with the Royal Mint, for the purchase of gold of standard fineness at a fixed price.
"5'. That for the purpose of carrying out these resolutions it is expedient that on the day of , in the year 13 , a public bank should be established, under the management of three paid commissioners, appointed by the GoTernor in Council, but not under the control of the Ex. ecutive Government, removable only by a vote of both Houses of Parliament, or of the House of Assembly in two succeeding sessions.
"6. That the conimissioners should act as bankers to the treasurer and all the public departments and accountants, taking over the balances now deposited in the private banks.
" 7. That the power of issuing bank notes should be exclusively vested in the commissioners, with the exceptions hereinafter provided.

The prospectus has been issued of the North of India Tramroad Company, with a capital of 1,000,0001. in 201. shares. The object is to furnish the populous and fertile province of Rohilcund with cheap roads, and the first intention is to construct 250 miles from Futteyghur to Delhi. They are intended to be for animal power, although capable of being made available for light locontotives. Some portions are estimated to cost 5,0001. per mile, and others only 2,5001. The district is especially adapted for tramroads, its geological character rendering the formation of good ordinary metalled roads almost impracticable, and the experiment on a moderate scale seems, therefore, highly expedient. io call is to be made, except upona guarantee being obtained from the East India Company.
It is now estimatedc th the Peninsulat and Oriental steamer will take out about 700,0001. on the 20th, principally silver for India, the amount engaged for China at present being limited.
The advices from New York to-day show a general rally in the stock-market, the principal railway securities having on the average experienced an advance of about 3 per cent. Erie was quoted 58, New York Central 90, Reading 81 to i, Panama 96, flhnois Central 138 to 139, and Illinois Central Bonds 100. Owing to the increasing certainty felt as to the extermination of Walker and his band from Nicaragua the shares of the Transit Company, which after his seizure of their boats had declined to 3, were now saleable at 3*.
The accounts from Mexico by the New York packet are to the 10th of February, and the subjoined mercantile letter firnishes the latest details regarding the treaty with the United States for a loan equal to 3,000,0001. sterling. It is alleged that 800,0001. of the amount is to be appropriated to the payment of the British convention creditors, in consequence, doubtless, of the pressure lately exercised by our Government, in which case a very favourable effect would be exercised on the exchange between America andthis countryoF
" We.xdco, Feb. 10.
'I addressed you last on the 2d inst. per packet, but I then studiously abstained from mentioning certain ramours which were abroad relative to a loan of $15,000,000, which the American Government was said to be about to make to the Mexican Government. There seemed to be so little probability in such rumours that I considered it prudentto mnake proL)er inquiries before I ventured to touch upon them, and I can now safely do so, having ascertained the drift of the matter, though I stillremain ignorant of certain details, and cannot vouch for the accuracy of some facts. The subject, however, is so interesting that you wi no doubt forgive any involuntary error I may be let into, anxious as I am to send you the inteUigence as soon as possible by way of the United States.
"There is no doubt that a formal treaty has either been signed already, or is about to be signed by the Mexican Governmient, and the new American Minister, Mlr. Forsyth, the main object of which is to lend the Mexicans $15,000,000; but I learn from very good sources that the treaty comprises at the same time a formal postal arrangement between the two countries, as well as certain commercial stipulations, relating chiefly to some particular articles of trade along the frontier line. Very contradictory accounts are afloat as to the truth of some especial provision made for thereciprocal extradition of oriminals between the two nations,-a question which is naturally supposed to involve some particular views with regard to slavery. Oat of the $15,000,COO, $3,000,000 are to be retained by the American Government to pay American claims, and $4,000,000 to pay off the British convention, at the request of the Meoxcans, the latter being desirous, it appears, of clearing their scores with John Boi. The present loan is to be at the rate of 4 yer cent. per annum, and to be repaid gradually by an asssgnment of 12 per cent. upon the import duties, and an additional assignment of 20 per cent. to be deducted from cargoes imported by American vessels. A Mexican war steamer is said to be in readiness to convey the bearers of this treaty to Mobile, in order that it may reach Washington before (ongress adjourns. I daresay I shallbe able to furnish you with further particulars bythe next packet. In the meantime I may add that the prevailig notion is that this loan will materially contribute to support the present Administration, and to thwart aU the efforts of the 'pronunciados,' who have indeed been particularly unlucky hitherto. Since the packet courier left Mexico the Government has received intelligence of a signal victory obtained by its own forces under the command of General Parrodi over the San Luis ronunciados. Among the latter was the young but celebrated rebhl chief ' Osollo,' who is said to have been taken prisoser and to have had his right arm carried off by a camnon balL
"Business is as usual very dull, and the roads infested with robbers in every direction.
"Exchange on London 4Ui per $."
The aunexed is from the Committee of Mexican bondholders:-
"The Committee have advices from Mr. WThitehead, dated Mexico the .9th ult. The terms of the treaty between Mexico and the United States for a loan by the latter to the former of $15,000.000 at 4 per cent, interest werenotpublic yet, but it was said that 13 or 14 per cent. of the import uties had been assigned for the payment of the interest, and that the tonnage dues on American shipping were to be reduced 20 per cent. From the loan, it was also said, $3,COO,000 were to be deducted for American claims, and $4,000,000 were to go tol pay off the British convention creditors, which would leave $8,000,C00 at the disposal of the Mexican Government. T e stato of the Republic as regards her domestic politics was improving; General Parro i had completely defeated and scattered the insurgents at Queretaro and taken their chief prisoners. Tampico also had at length submitted to the Government, and the last news from all other parts of the country were satisfactory.,,
The weekly reviews from the Amsterdam and Rotterdam produce-markets state that the operations, although less extensive, were ganerally at the late advance. The pricess for coffee were supported wvith firmness, and in sugar and tea a steady business had been transacted. Some descriptions of leather had experienced a further rise. The letters from Rouen mention a greater activity in the market for manufactures, butthe quotations, owing to the high value of the raw material, are stil said to be unremunerative.
The following relates to the question of telegraphic communication with India. For reasons which which wiU be understood by persons conversant with the engineering projects of the past 10 years it has little claim to attention, but its insertion will help to explain to the public the relative position of the promoters of the two routes which have been suggested. The line by the Euphrates Valley, as was intimated in the House of Commons last night, has been approved both by the Government and the India House, who have arranged to guarantee 6 per cent, interest from the date of completion, and it is a necessary adjunct to the railway and steamboat route about to be
opened through the most fertile provinces of Syria. The other-that by the Red Sea-is a secondary one. If any persons can be found willing to carry it out wfithout Government aid it will be satisfactory, as far as commercial interests are concerned, to have a double means of communication; but meanwhile it is difficult to perceive what advantage or credit its promoters can contemplate by endeavouring to underrate the Euphrates line on the pretexts in this letter. The attempt to represent the fact of the [Government guarantee being dependent on the sub-
scription of the fol amount of capital on 20 per cent. being paid up, and on the line being completed, as something to the disadvantage of the company, and of which the public need to be reminded, is extraordibary:-

East India Company have entered into a provisional agreement for supporting the telegraph to India sed the Euphrates Valley, 1 have to remind you that such agreement does not take effect until the whole capital of the company is subscribed, and 20 per cent. paid uP, nor until the 'whole hine is laid, and only continnee so long as it is ! in 'workin order. I have also to remind you that the Euro. pean and mdian Junction Telegraph Company have no oncession to lay anmile of their line, and thatitis stated in their prospectus-' No call 'will be made until the concession has becn secured by the fa of the Sultan and the Iother arrangements contemplated by the directors are com-

It appears that, OWing to a porthon of the plates and paper employed for the Government Eichequerbills having been destroyed at the recent fire at Messrs. Perkins, Bacon, and Co. the Government wil be unable to issue new bills to the amount of about 600,0001. against those recently sent into the Exchequer for renewal. The descriptions wanted are those of 2001. and 5001. each, and they are not expected to be ready for a month. It is singular that precaution should have been neglected for preserving a duplicate stock against accidents.
The colonial wool sales, which commenced on the 16th of February, closed to-day, and the following account of them is from Messrs. Southey and Son:-
" These sales comprised 6,572 bales Sydney, 12,312 bales Port Phillip, 1,454 bales Van Diemen's Land, 1,384 bales South Australian, 828 bales New Zealand, 100 bales Swan River, and 18,744 bales Care of Good Rope, making 41,394 bales of colonial, besides 2, 34 bales of East Indian.
' The pressing wants of nearly all classes of buyers caused an undue excitement at the early sales, which were very nunerously attended, and an advance of nearly 3d. per lb. on Australian wool generaly, and 2d. per lb. on Cape wool, was freely paid on November prices. Sydney fleece wool, of which there was a limited supply, nearly maintained the advance throughout the sales, but all other descriptions of Australian wool gave way towards the close of the second week ; the utmost improvement on last sales cannot be quoted higher that Id. per lb. It will be observed South Australia and Van Diemen's Land .contributed very little to these sales. Lambs and skin wools were in much request. The large quantity of Cape wool offered almost daily found eager buyers the first five or six sales at the advance stated; prices then settled down to about Id. improvement on November sales for good scoured, and continued firm to the end; the lower qualities did not indicate any advance. Notwithstanding expectations held out at the opening sales were not realzed, the vast bulk of Cape woo cleared on this occasion, at prices quite as high as the state of the trade justified, clearly evmnces the estimation in which it is held, and must be encouraging to the 'dockmasters of that colony. It is considered about 20 per cent, of the whole quantity offered was taken for foreign account. East India sold with spirit atld. advance on last London prices."

The revenue account shows a balance to the credit of the company of upwards of 6001., but the directors cannot reeommend the shareholders to declare any dividend on,the present occasion, as that sum has been exhausted by payments on account of capital. The capital account shows that 33,8891. had been received, including 6061. from revenue, and 28,2681. expended, leaving a balance consisting of 5,4531. of shares on hand and arrears of calls, 1621. due by the North British Railway on account of revenue, and 51. by the secretary. The revenue account for the half-year ending the 31st of January last shows that 1,3861. had been received and 8971 expended, leaving a balance of 4891.

The total number of deaths reglstered in London, which In the previous woek was 1,175, was in the week that ended last SIatArdiy 1,156, showing again a decrease, which has been maintained during the last fivo weeks, and which in circumistances as favourable as those of the present time i; to bo expected towards the end of the first quarter of the year. In the ten years 1847-56 the average number of deaths in the weeks corresponding with last week was 1,199. IE this is raised in proportion to increase of population it be comes 1,319, and represents the number of deatlhs which the average rate of mortality would produce at the present time; and it is shown by a reduction in the actual number to the extent of 163 that the publio health is at present decidedly better than usuaL
The number of births exceeded the number of deaths by 488. Of the 1,156 persons who died 573 were mdaes and 583 females.
The deaths referred to diseases of the zymotic character were last week 217; tho corrected average of corresponding weeks is 24. Five children and a person of middle age died-of smaUpox, 11 children of croup, 24 of scarlatina,. 27 of measles, 38 of typhus and common fever, 72 of whoopingcough, The deaths from diarrhea declinedto 9. The southern division, namely, all that part of London which lies on the south side of the river, is at present unusualUy free from epidemics. No deaths occurred in it last week from smalpox, only I from measles, 4 from scarlatina, 10 from whoopingcough, 2 from diarrhcea, and 8 from typhus; the total number on the south side from these six diseases was 25, being the seventh part of the total number in the metropolis, though the population of the former is to that of the latter nearly as one to four. The Registrar of Somers-town states that there are some cases of smallpox in the neighbourhood of Pancras-square. Bronchitis was fatal last week in 135 cases; p'neumonia in 100; the mortality from the latter disease now becoming greater relatively to that of Lhe former. A woman died in the Greonwich Workhouse from mortification, the effect of frost two months ago. Only one nonagenarian died in the week-viz., the widow of a coach. man in Clerkenwell, who had attained the age of 96 years.
Last week the births of 858 boys and 786 girls, in aU 1,641 children, were registered in London. In the 10 corresponding weeks of the years 1847-56 the average number was 1,606.
At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the mean height of the barometer in the week was 29 607 inches. The highest reading in the week was 29-92 inches on Thursday. The mean temperature of the week was 37-2 deg., which is 3-3 deg. below the average of the same week in 43 years, a; determined by Mr. Glaisher. On Wednesday the mean temperature was only 33-3 deg., which is 7 deg. below the average. The lowest temperature occurred on Tuesday, and was 28 deg.; the highest was 56-6 deg., and occurred on Saturday, the only day on which the mean temperature Was above the average. The entire range of the week was 28&6 deg. The mean dew-point temperature was 31-9 deg., and the difference between this and the mean temperature of the air was 563 deg. The wind, which was generally in the 1. And N.N.E. at the beginning of the week, blew aftwards from the S. W. Rain or hail fell to tha amount of 0 33 inch. Heavy hail storms occurred on Sun. day, the 8th inst. During one storm the temperature fell 9 deg. in five minutes, and in another the baUs were unusually large, And measurod in some instances 3 inches round at their base.

STATE OF TRADE.
MANCHESTER, MIARCH 17.
There is not much business doing, but there is a healthy tone in the market, and principally owing to the good accounts from Calcutta and Bombay. Prices are very firm. The telegraphic advices from Liverpool speak of an active business in cotton, with prices in favour of seUers, and this has helped to support the yarn and cloth markets, There would.Xrobably have been more business in yarns this morning h the Gcrman letters come to hand; they were noet received till this afternoon. From their tone it is not improbable that some engagements wiUl be entered into this evening for twists suitable to that market. The yaramarket is very firm generally, with an upward tendency, and spinners decline to enter into contracts at present rates.
Messrs. John Slagg and Co. report:-"There is little change to notice in the market since our last report. We continue to have a good demand for low shirtings, Madapolams, and jaconots for India, especialy since the receipt of the impurovd accounts to hand ths morning by the overlacnd mail, and prices still tend upwards. f ongeloths T-cloths, and good prmters also contiue in fair request at last weres quotations. With these exceptions the market s quiet, but without change in prices."
NTOTTIGHA, MAncir 17.
There is a decided improvement in the home demand for lbac, the fine geather having operated favourably. In adIditon to an improvement in the home trade, there are numerous orders in the market for export both for the Continental and American markets. For the finer descriptions of platn nets there is more inquiry, and in coarser qualities notwithstanding the high priec demanded, there is a good. business doing. In silk and fancy laces the trade is quiet.
In hosiery there is a fair amount of business doing, and the favourable change in the weather will create a still further improvement. Manufacturers are anticipating both a good home and foreign trade. The framework-knitting branch has for some time being in a healthy state, the operatives being weU employed at good wages.
Silks and yarns continue firm.
LEICESTER, XARCH 17.
There is very little alteration to report in trade, although there is no doubt that the fineness of the weather will influence business for tho better. Cotton goods are sold readily, and this branch isdecidedly brisk. In worsted articles very little is doing. Materials, both wosted and wool, continue very high.
LEEDS, 11MARCH 17.
The cloth-halls havo been visited by a good number of buyers to-day; but stocks being low, not a very Irge business was done, and the market, upon the whole, was of '
quiet character. The light kinds of fabrics for summer wear are in chief request.
RUDDERSFIELD, MA.Rcu 17.:
The cloth-market to-day has not been quite so brisk as last Monday, the agitation about the impending election rather checking business. Low goods, unions, steel mixtures, &c., meet with tolerably good sale. Wool continues high and firmin price.

DARING BURGLARY.-On Friday morning, at
DARING BURGOLARY.-On Friday morning, at an early hour, the dwellinghouse of MIr. White, a farmer residing at Hamsterley, a retired viage in the western part of the county of Durham, was entered by a man armed with a formidable weapon-a "hay spade," who proceeded to ransack the house. Mr. White wan not at home, and the only inmates were some women. The servantgirl, hearing a noise in the house, gave the alarm, when the man at once struck her with a gun, of which he had possessed himself in the house. The blows inflicted were of a severe character, the girl's head being much beaten and cut. Other members of the family havingbeenalarmedthe burglarmade off,taking the gun with
~~~~~~~~~~~ him, and leavnng behind him, in his hasWtoewksape, his coat
and boots. The pockets of the coat were stuffea with various articles belonging to Mr. White. A man went after the thief, and got almost upto him, but he presented thegun at his pursuer, who then gave npthe pursuit. Chase was also made by a man on horseback, but he did not get near the burglar, who made his escape. The police authorities at Bisbop Auckland aud Darlington were immediately communicated with; a description of the man was given, and a poeson answering the description having been seen iu the neighbourhood, whose name was well known, the country was scoured for miles round, night and day, by the county constabulary stationed at Darlington. Occasionally they were on the trail of the thief. It was known he was armed, and that he bad threatened to shoot any one who should attempt to arrest him. On Monday morning, from some information which reached Mr. Superintendent Robson, of Darlington, that officer accompanied by Sergeant Lynn and Police-constable Young, proceeded along the Auckland-road, and when they reached a retired place called Capshaw-bank, about three miles from Darlington, the force divided, Sergeant Lynn taking the inside of the fields on the right side of the road, and Police-constable Young the left, the superintendent going along the road in his dogeart. As soon as Lynn bad got over the hedge he observed a man lying amongthe bushes, and at once called out "H oldia" to the other officers. The man then sprung up, stepped from the hedge and deliberately presented the gun and fired at Lynn, lackily without hitting him, although within half a dozen yards. Lynn observed the man point the gun, and leant aside and hed up his arm. The contents of the gun passed close to his bodv, in faot between his arm and his body. The man then attempted to fire the second basrrel, and had actuaaUy got it half-cocked when Lynn courageously sprung at him and seized him by the throat, both going down together. The other officers went at once to Lynn's assistance and the man was secured and taken to the lockup at Dar. lington.. His name is Wiliam Alderson, alias Burnsides, alias G oldsbrough, and be is only 25 years of age. He has been convicted twice before,-once for housebreaking. He was well known to the polce from having worked since he came out of gaol at the public drainage works in Darlington. In addition to a double-barrelled gun he had in his possession a loaded pistol at full cock. He was brought before the Bench here to-day and remanded. It seems be had broken into a " cabin" on the Stockton and Darlington Railway between Saturday night and Monday morning, and stolen an overcoat, which he had on when arrested.
Ay EiXTRACRDLyrA?Y GA= oF CHrss.-The Ca£6 de la Regence, Paris, on Friday night was the scene of an extraordinary display of chess power, M. Harrwitz, the celebrated player, contending, without seeing the board, in two ames at the same tire against two players of the Paris
Jhess Club. Prince Antoine Bonaparte, the Duke of Brunswick, the Marquis de Carracciolo, Count Issoire, and a great number of amateurs and members of the club, were present, and followed with unflagging interest to the close the wonderful feat of mental abstraction and chess memory which M. Harrwitz presented on the occasion, without, to aU appearance, any harassing effect. To better understand how the matches were conducted, it may be as well to state that the Cafe de la Regence consists of two large saUes on the ground fioor; one fitted up as a cafe, Properly so caUed, an the other provided with billiard tables and arranged as an estaminet, m which smoking is allowed. In both of these rooms, which are open to all, and in which chess is going on nearly aU day long, the amateur is sure at all times to find some one willing to play a game. But above is situated a range of rooms appropriated to the nse of the Paris Chess Club, and in these it was that the wonderful display took place on the occasion of which we speak. In the eentre of the largest of these rooms were placed two tables, at which were seated, each with a board and chessmen before him, hi. Lecrivain and hL P-, the gentlemen with whom M. Harrwitz was to engage in peaceful conflict. The room beyond, the last of the suite, was set apart for the mental player, all its fitting-up consisting merely of three or four chairs, and a table in one corner, on which were placed wine, sugar, and -water, and other refreshments, as well as writing materials, to enable the gentleman who acted as secretary to mark down the moves when decided on. The door of communication between tho two rooms was kept open the whole time, so that every one could see that not only M. Harrwitz had no means of aidin" his miemory by any extraneous or tangible object, but that all intercourse with other persons was absolutely impossible. All round the other rooms were arranged chess-tables, on which the amateurs invited to be present followed the movcs as they were played. Everything being declared in readiness, at about half-past 9 the play commenced. The manner in which the moves wvere announced was this .- 1L Lequesne, wvho had kindly consented to act as secretary, after having received his instructions from IL Barrwitz, wrote down the moves for both games, and then entering the other room and saying " First game," specified the move fixed for it ; next, saying " Second gamne," lDe acted in the same way for it. The moves, thus named, were then played on the board. and the two adversaries studied the reply to be given. When both gentlemen had decided hI. Lequesne marked down the moves as before, and thenin turn announced aloud to M. Harrwitz, exactly in the same manner, the advance so given in each case. The longest ame, in which there was remarkably fine play on both sides, astedthree hours and a-half, and from the beginning to the end of that long space of time, during which the strain on the memory must have been enormous, M.. Iarrwitz (says Galignani) never for a Yaoment appeared in the slightest degree embarrassed, nor did he delay longer in his moves than he probably would have done in an ordinary gane, when looking at the board. The replies certainly came more rapidly from him than from the other room, M. Lcri. vain taking a considerable time to examine each osition and playing with great caution; Mf. P-, on the other hand, moved at once, and, being naturally a quick player, soon got somewhat fatig%ied by the great length of time which he was obliged to remain unoccupied while waiting for the decisions of M. Lcrivain. It is most probably to this circumstance that must be attributed the fact that he bynomeans equalled his usual game. It was after 1 o'clock when X Uasrwitz came into the general room after winDing in both games. He declared himself to be but little fatigued, and, in answer to observations made to Liitp, proceeded at onice to explain vaiious points of his play.

In the House of Lords laat night,
The LORD CoANxbLIO;, in reply to Lord St. LZONRARD'S, stated that it was his intention to bring n a BiU next session on the aubject of Criminal Breaches of Trust.
Lord HAIiDwIcxE pressed for the production of
the despatches recently received by the GoVernIeull from Sir MRcHA. SZYOVR.
Lord GBRANYUZZ promised to iee that the despatches were produced.
A discussion then arose as to the judgment of Sir JoHN BowRixW, and as to the position in which he stood as to rank and authority with regard to Sir MiCRnM SxBiOUR. In this discussion Lords HARDwic , GBSY, GRA.u?Z1,F' ELENnBOROUGr, DEmur, and PAN. run took part.
Lord CLANRICARDE then inquired as to the rate of pay which the troops sent to China were to receive, and whether Indian camp followers were to be attached to them.
Lord PA-unn explained the arrangements in force with regard to the pay of the troops who would form the Chinese expedition, and stated that a certain number of camp followers would be furnished by the Indian Government and attached to the several regiments.
The Earl of ERNoRouGH explained the uses of camp followers, and made from his Indian experiences several sa'gestions for improving the efficiency of the troops. le then passed on to deplore French
co-operation wFith the British anus in China, anda concluded by declaring that much time might be saved by employing the troops set free by the Persian treaty, instead of those about to sent from Eng]anud.
Lord PANWRz having thanked Lord BinoRouas for his advice,
Lord GRZY deplored the extension which was evidently to be given to the operations against China.
Lord GnAiNimLE reminded Lord GRZY that the best means to sceure a speedy peace was to negotiate with a strong force behind you.
The matter then dropped, and, several bills having been forwarded a stage, their Lordships adjourned.
In the House of Commons,
Mr. BRA=BY-MOOR1: caled attention to the question of the Sound Dues, and asked the CHANcELLoZ of the ExConmQuL if a treaty had been signed to capitalize those dues and indemnify Denmark for giving up her reputed rights, and if it was the intention of Him MAjssrys Government that such treaty should be acted upon before Parliament voted the money. In supporting a motion for the production of papers upon this subject he observed that the dues had been hypothecated, and it was imp)ortant to know whether the money was to be paid to theDanish Government or to the bondholders. He remarked likewise upon the comparative decrease of British tonnage passing the Sound, and that the complaint agaist the dues was not on account of the money demand, but the delay.
After a question put by Mr. LIDDELT,
The CHACELLOR of the EXCIIEQuR said the negotiations which had been carried on by the principal States of Europe for the redemption of these dues (which were detrimental to the trade of this country, not only on account of the sums levied, but of the delay and the additional charges thereby incurred) had terminated on the 14th of this month in two treaties, signed at Copenhagen,one between Denmark, on the one part, and Russia, Prussia, France, Great Britain, and other States on the other, containing general stipulations; the second was a separate treaty between Great Britain and Denmark. Copies of these treaties, as signed, had not yet been received, and he was therefore unable to answer the questions put to him with confidence, but from the draught he could state their effect, without pledging himself to the accuracy of hisstatement. By the general treaty the Sound would be opened on theist of April, and the cornpensation to be paid by each Power was fixed. By the separate convention between Great Britain and Demnark the amount fixed for this country, subject to the decision of Parliament, was to be paid within three months. The question of hypotbecation was between the Danish Govermment and the bondholders.
Sir H. WILLOUGHBY inquired what was the amount of the compensation.
The COH"cW.on of the Exc}Iquan replied 1,125,2061.
The motion was withdrawn.
Certain Bils were advanced a stage.
Mr. DISsEIu inquired whether it was correct, as had been reported, that HEB MAJLSry's Govern ment had offered to a foreign Power, if any attempt to establish Republican institutions were made in the south of Italy, to interfere, by force of arms if necessary, to prevent them.
Lord PAoMRasi-oN said there had been no such offer.
Questions were subsequently put by Mr. HENILxY and Mr. DISRAELI upon the subject with the same result.
Some further business was disposed of, and the House adjourned at 25 minutes before 6 o'clock.
What is a Coalition? It really is no question of
What is a Coalitionx? It really is no question of ours, for if we have applied the word to the recent majority in the Commons it was merely for lack of a better. There was a fact to be described. With all deference, not only to Lord DEBBY, but to the Prmuxa, that fact was something more than "i a fortuitous concourse of atoms," though it il no concern of ours to prove it more. That it was more is undeniable, for it was foreknown. For five days before all the world had been calculating the majority, putting it one day at six, another day at twenty, and another day at eight, while one estimate went to sixty. So the atoms knew what they were about, and they knew what one another was about, and what the whole was about. They knew, moreover, that they need not vote at aU on the question, and that if they made a majority for the censure they must expect a dissolution. So the concurrence was something more than the casual meeting of three friends on the top of the Righi, or three enemies in Pall-mall, or a Cardinal, an AngliEcan Bishop, and an eminent Wesleyan preacher in a dentisfs 'waiting-room. The famous concurrence in tho lobby was more the sort of meeting that takes place when some special object or performance is announced in which certain persons are known to take a common interest. Advertise a fight or a foot-race, and there are people who will tell you who are sure to be there. Catch a live ichthyosaurus, and announce him to be seen in a dying state in Regentstreet to-morrow, and you know who will hasten to see the beast before he joins his fossilzed brethren. Announce the discovery of the original MIS. of Jun.ius, and you may easily count on your fiDgers the score or two elderly gentlemen who will presentthemselveswiththeir spectacles at theearliest opportunity. We know, too, who may be expected at a fox-hunt, who at a picture sale, who at an execution. It was a community of interest and of feeling that flled the lobby on the occasion before us. That community may not go very far-we don't think it does-but, if it did, it would constitute a friendship, SALLUSTjtells us, stronger than any formal or nominal friendship. If we have applied the word " Coalition," it was certainly in no stronger sense than the above. Lord DERBY knew what COIDEN lik-ed, and COBDEN knew what Lord DXzBy liked, and both knew what
GLADSTONE liked, and GrADSTowE - knew what cer- I tain others would have no objection to, and so there was on this point a common feeling and a common action. In the words of the old philosophers,
'Done mind inspired the whole mass, and made it "one body."
But, as great offence has been taken at the use of the word, and Lord DunBY seems to consider himself accused of corresponding with COBDZN, or holding a conversation with him, or corming to terms with him, and actually feeling a friendship for him, we beg toUay that we never thouglht him. capable of this; and we will freely admit that wre have used the word in no precise sense, but merely to describe a fact more easily apprehended than described. But what, then, is a Coalition? Let us consult old SAM, who is rather behind even his own age on the subject, but. very good as far as he goes. "Coalition," he says, "is union in one
*'mass or body; conjunction of separate parts "in one whole." if this be all it is mther
hard that Lord DErBY, Lord HAItDWIC, and Lord MALnuitSaUy should threaten to hang, draw and quarter, shoot, burn, destroy, and drown everybody who applies theword "Coalition" to the otherwise indescribable event. But tho immortal lexicGgrapher, as usual, gives some very apt quotations, and his quotations are like the eyes in old pictures, that catch your own eye wherever you stand. " The world," says GL-VILL-E, " is a mass of hete" rogenous consistencies, and every part thereof " a coalition of distinguishable varieties." If this does not describe the contents of the lobby this day week we will say by-and-by wherein it falls short. But to proceed. "In the first coalition of
a people," says HALE, "their prospect is not "great; they provide laws for their present exi" gence." This is the first "Coalition" of the sort we have had, and the "prospect" of MIr. COBDEN's majority certainly is not great. Its exigence and its laws were strictly confined to the present hour, and already are obsolete. One more ilustration from BENmZy :-" 'Tis necessary that "these squandered atoms should convene and "unite into great masses; without such a coal"tion the chaos must have reigned to all eter"nity. " One could imagine BENTLEr to have had just such a chaos as the present Opposition before him, just such a throng of " squandered atoms," dancing about like motes in a sunbeam. If, then, he beheld a sudden convention and union of these atoms, promising an end to this chaos, his vision must have been prophetic of the year 1857. But we need not go beyond the root of the word. What is " to coalesce V" It is "to unite in masses by a spontaneous approxi" mation to each other." Is not this exactly what al these people did last week? Was not their app;oximation to one another perfectly spontaneous ? Why, then, did they not coalesce, and why may it not be caUed a Coalition? At least, what is the harm of it, and why are we to be rated so severely for using the word ?
We will answer the question honestly, and rather paradoxically. No doubt, the word " Coali"tion" does express a good deal too much. These " squandered atoms" have not it in them to grow to one another and unite into a consistent, living, permanent whole. There's no mind for the mass; no spirit to move and join it; no soul to quicken and keep it alive. It's too true, as Lord DERBY takes infinite pains to explain to thewretched atoms, that they are naturaly and incurably incongruous. They are like the atoms of EPICulus, some of which are square, some round, some sharppointed, some ali shapes, some movo in a straight line, some in a curved line, some zigzag, and some don't move at all, except as they are made to move. Lord DERBY avows himself an atom of the most peculiar and unaccommodating character. He won't and can't coalesce with COBDENI, or GIBsow, or ROEBuCK, any more than with SrurnEox or tho new Bishop of RIrox. He sees no prospect of a coalition with SIDrNEY HERBERT, or GRAHIAM, or CARDWELL. He openly repudiates Lord JoRN RussELL, Sir F. B,MGni, and Lord R. GRosvESoR. In his own House he is equally repulsive; and, lest any tender " atom" should feel the least desire to coalesce with his nobler essence, he announces his own theory of a Premier, vwhich is, that he is the Government, and aU the rest are "appendages." It is not very surprising to find, on the authority of Lord DunBy himself, that there is not a man of note or power who is ready to become his "appendage." As for the MIanchester gentlemen, they are so hopeless that nothing is lost by insulting them. Of the four Peelites three decline the honour of being tacked to his Lordship's tail, and only one of them consents to wear the STmRLEY livery. Lord DERBY and Mfr. GLADSTONE have long since felt that " spontaneous approximation," that sure source of friendship, which arises from strong points of similarity under very different circumstances. The one is to the Lords what the other is to the Commons, and if either were not himself it is evident he would be the other. They are equally voluble and equaly loud ; they equally take the ear by storm and disappoint the next morning's reader. Were the fate of the empire to be decided every night, it is clear that, with Lord DERBY in the one House and Mr. GLADsToNm in the other, they would carry all before them; but, so long as time and other influences are allowed to work, neither of them wlU ever do much more than contribute to the entertainment of the public. This, then, we are not sorry to be told is all that the Coalition has come to, or is likely to come to. Actual pledges are said to have been exchanged. lfr. GLADsToN-E is said to be secured against an opposition at Oxford, and MA.r. S. HERBERT is threatened with one in South Wilts. Under the auspices of the Coalition, if the intimate union of two statesmen out of power can be so called, the University of Oxford is to resume its old attitude of alienation from Government and the progressive influences of the age. While its representatives are overwhelming the two Houses of Parliament with their fruitless rhetoric, it is to amuse itself as best it can by sneering at the favoured objects of ecclesiastical patronage. The Coalition, we ean readily believe, will not go much further. Lord DERBY does not appear to wish for one of a more comprehensive character, and certainly does not go the way to procure one. His right hon. " appendage" will not have much voice in the matter. How long the devoted Squire will be content with the barren and sometimes costly achievements of his adventurous Knight we cannot undertake to guess. To judge from similar cswes, he will long sometimes for a more substantial result than hard blows and sorry fare ; but we question whether he will get more by mere political knight-errantry.
We presume Mr. COBDEN will take it as a com-
We presume Mr. COBDEN will take it as a compliment if we consider his speech at the Freemasons!-hall on Monday night as a fair manifesto of his sect, and as an exposition of the arguments with which his friends wliU go to the hustings against Lord PAL,NtSvToN and his Chinese policy. Certainly nobody is better qualified to deal with such a matter than himself, for he was the author of the resolutions on which the division took place, and is thoroughly practised in addressing public meetings on popular topics. What added to the excellence of the opportunity in the instance before us was that Mr. LAYARD, in immediately preceding him, had relieved him from the necessity of taling up the subject iiL its technicalities and details, so that he was enabled to condense the case into a few plain English paragraphs, and present it from a common-sense point of view. How much was made out for himself and his friends under these favourablo circumstances the reader shall presently see.
" lVhat I ask you," said Wr. COBDEN to his audience, putting the question as a comuprehensive point in the very front of his remarks, "is, "w whether you think it is the province of the " House of Commons to inquire into these "questions at al l Because what I understand
is this,-that here is the Executive Govern"ment appealing to the country against Par"liament for having investigated those matters "which were bronght before us." The Government has taken no such ground. It has simply appealed to the country in order to ascertain whether a Parliament now in the fifth year of its existence does or does not represent the opinion of the country according to the theory of the Constitution. Of course, it is " the province of the "House of Commons to inquire into these ques"tions ," nobody eve thought of denying it ; but
that Houso is a representative House, and the question was whether the constituencies which it represeuts enterined similar vie" upon the subject of inquiry. MIr. COBDni asTs whether the House should have remained iie±t or allowed the public money to be spentwithout notice. By no means; but let us ask him in return whether he thinks the people ought to remain silent, or whether, if the House of Commons ought to keep - an eye upon the Government, the country ought not to keep an eye upon the House ? We thought the accountability of imembers to their constituents was one of the chief tenets of the extreme Liberal creed, that short reckonings were all in favour, and that the oftener " appeals "to the country" were made the better it would be.
3Ir. ConDmN tben gave his hearers a practical view of the issue before the country. " This," said he, " is not a question of peace at any price. It "is a question whether we shall go 12,000 or " 14,000 miles off and rush heedlessly and need" lessly into war with a people who are very little "able to defend themselves, and who never come "to attack you." We can only reply that this is not the question at all-not even as it is understood by his own friends. We have no option about going to war, for we are at war already, and most of those who regarded the rupture as avoidable are still ready to acknowledge that the thing must be gone through with now. Mr. LAYA.RD himself had said from the very same platform, not a% minutes before, that if the Govermment had but condemned the policy of Sir J. Bo wnRI,a and had then said to Parliament, " We come to you and say that this " war now is necessary ; we are in it, and we " must carryit on," a majority of the House, in his belief, would have supported the appeal. WVhether the proceedings taken at Canton were "heedless and needless," or otherwise, was indeed made a question, though even that is not the question before the country, for the events were accomplished long before they were heard of by the Administration now put upon its trial. The true question is whether Lord P.ALnERcSroN has forfeited his title to public approbation by extending a prompt and cordial support to the representative authorities of this country in a distant region, acting as they did, and we look with very considerable confidence for the reply.
"W What do you go to China for T" says M:r. COBDEN. "You go fortea and silk." So we do, and for nothing else ; and, as we only go for tea and silk, and carry very good money to pay for it, we think it rather hard that we should be subjected to insult as barbarians, and confined to a disagreeable and degrading position by the very people who live upon our custom, and who, if we stood not merely upon the rights of men, but the stipulations of treaties, could not hold their own against us for a moment. " You all know," he added, " that this nation is " at your feet." Undoubtedly, as far as applies to our ascendancy at Canton and along the coast, we are quite aware of this fact ; and it is precisely on this account that the. treatment we receive is calculated to excite so much indignation. If we chose in our territories to subject the Chinese to contumely, we could, at any rate, plead the excuse of might, if not of right; but that we, though the strongest, should leave thera entire liberty, whereas they, though the weakest, should assume not only the airs of arrogance, but the actual attitude of oppressors, is rather too bad. The Chinese, in fact, get the benefit, as a nation, of two opposite attributes. Dealing with others they comport themselves as the most powerful people in the world, but when dealt with in return their impotence is pleaded as a guarantee for their impunity. They swarm over our colonies in shoals, enjoying the most absolute freedom of habits, worship, and everything else; but when we go to Canton, and upon errands very profitable to them, we are forthwith consigned to treatment which MtIr. COBDENV hiniself confessed he should not much like.
Speaking of YEa and his atrocities, Mr. CoBDEN
says that " we are told the Chinese are such very " bad people that it is necessary we should go " and punish them," and he asks whether, supposing Yan to have slaughtered some 70,000 of his countrymen, we shall mend the matter by killing 20,000 or 30,000 more? This is not the matter we are called upoII to mend, but we certainly do think that the character given to YEia and his proceedings by the concurrence of all accounts affords a pretty fair presumption that he cannot be remarkable for meekness of dealing with us. We should like to understand, also, with what face a man who has thus overborne and overridden the strongest possible passions of the provincial community, and who has drowvned in blood upon the Execution-ground of the city the principles of an insurrection appealing to the most poverful instincts of patriotism and religion, can pretend to be incapable of so far moderating popular feeling as to allow the fulfilment of a treaty by admitting a few strangers into Canton.
The question of this admission is one which is important from its many collateral bearings. Mr. COBDEN asked in the debates whether it was likely Englishmen would live in the city, even if admitted, any more than they now live in the Turkish parts of Constantinople, although at liberty to do so. But this is not the gist of the contest. The real struggle is for the removal of a degrading stigma, and the termination of a barbarous assumption, calculated in itseli to inspire the Cantonese with ideas of turbulence and arrogance. If Englishmen stood excluded from Constantinople as beings of an inferior order, aud if the Ottomans of the capital were encouraged in the impression that they, by private and particular manifestations of violence, might preserve this precious privilege against the direct concessions of the SULTAN himself, we suspect the residence of our countrymen on the Bosphorus would not be so secure as at present. We believe, in fact, that the non-enforcement of this article of the treaty has been the chief cause of that spirit on the part of the Chinese out of which disturbances have arisen. Excepting where the facilities of official intercourse were
concerned it is possible that the admission to Canton may have been of no great advantage to us, but the true point at issue was the preservation or extinction of that truculent bigotry which the Cantonese had been taught to cherish as a distinction of their own. At the other open ports of the Celestial Empire Europeans are received on an equitable footing; at Canton alone are they barbarians still. That this exception should have operated to the prejudice of our relations in that port is no more than might be anticipated. When a large city population is permitted to nullify a national compact, reasonable in its conditions, on no other ground than its owvn intemperate violenoe, it is nattural to expect that a spirit thus encouraged should fnd expression on other occasions. The security, in fact, of our countrymen at Canton, not only at present, but for the future, is the true object of the contest. This, we trust, ma be soon permanently establishled, and if with6Iany extension of hostilities so much the better.
In the present state of affairs it needed not
In the present state of affairs it needed not the LO"D CHANCELLORes announcement to assura us that the two Government Law Rleform tneasures are to be once more put aside. The " Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Bill" and the "Probates and Letters of Administration, " Bill" are but dull topics for the hustings.
UIatters or mere utility must yield their place now. And yet this Parliament might have gone down to its doom with the sweet odour of one good deed 'done in its dying year. Never were questions tnore ripe for legislation than these two subjects of 3)ivorce and Ecclesiastical Law. The wish to legislte is universal; the object of legislation is defimite and notorious. Nothing was required but {he modlus ope,andi. A man with a good knowledge of the subject, common industry, and ordinary intelligence would have put the general sentiment into a bill in three weeks. To use the LORD CHANcELLoR's favourite argument, we would rengage to get the work well done for a couple of hundred pounds.
But Lord CRArNWORTH cannot do this simple tiatter. NVhen he appears in the character of a Law Reformer his mind seems clogged with the 'dust and cobwebs of a former age. One would imagine that he had been consorting in spirit with a circle of pre-ELDONITE conveyancers, that their talk had been of the pleasanat ways of Chancery, -and that they had found the Elysian Fields planned in emulation of Lincoln's-inn, and divided into 'Old-square and New-square, Stone-buildings and the Chapel-staircase. When we ask for fresh, new, active, vigorous, work-ing Courts, such as other Law Iteformers have planted al over the country, Lord COA.wwornTR's mind wanders back to his preELDONITE converse, and, with an innocence which 'would make him venerated in the East, he offers 'us as the perfection of aU Courts and all judicatures-tke Court of Chancery,
Now, 'Englishmen believe in Cbancery just as :Spaniards believe in purgatory, and they pray as ,devoutly against it. We believe they are right; for, reform it as you may, the evils of its administration are such that two attorneys can always -contrive to melt any estate down into costs. But, right or wrong, the feeling exists, and -a sensible mnan would defer to it when proposing a new measure. Lord CRA'WoR:TH, however, cannot keep the Court of Chancery out 4of his Bills. The LoBD CHANCELLOR is to be at the head of his Divorce Court; the LORD OHANCELLOr. is, or was, to make rules and orders for Ihis Court of Probate; and a XVice-Chancellor is to be the Judge of the same Court. The Court of Chancery has taken upon itself to give effect to deeds of separation, and therefore the new Bil is to legalize every agreement to live separate to give the woman the property rights of a feme sole, and -to take away any power of compelling cohabitation,-a legislative enactment which would faithfuUly reflect the social habits of the Gipsies or of the Arabs of the Tell.
Strange to say, our hopes of getting rid -of Chancery depend upon a man from whom we should scarcely have expected such assistance. Lord ST. LEoNARD'S, w ho grew up in -the Court of Chancery, and who is an incarnation of its principles, its traditions, and its technicalities, has come forward to protect his old ,court froim Lord CRANwonTit's meddling sciolism. Like ADDISON, who killed Sir RoGER DP CovERIY rather than his pet character should be profaned by STEELE's ruder touch, Lord ST. LEONARD'S is content to destroy the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery in all matters testamentary and matrimonial, rather than Lord CANwVORTH should create excrescences to the dear fabric. He proposes, therefore, whenever these Bills reach a committee, to move amendmnents to the effect that the new Courts shaU be altogether distinct from the Court of Chancery, -and that Sir JOHN DODSON shall be the ordinary Judge of both of them.
This is a reasonable proposition. In seeking for a new Judge for new Courts some regard should be had to a man's previous practice. Matrimonial and testamentary matters have been peculiarly within the ken of Doctors'-commons. They are subjects with
hvhich Sir JOHN DODSON must have been conversant all his life. The Vice-Chancellors may be soundheaded men, but their reading and their practice are far away from these subjects. Putting aside the popular dislike of Chancery, it is a small and jedlar way of dealing with public business to try to get it done cheaply by a man whose business is not to do it at all. If we have an unnecessary Vice-Chancellor let the office be suppressed, but do not set the poor man to work involuntary injustice by deciding matters he does not understand. It is a dangerous thing to speculate upon great versatility of talent; the most recent experiment of this kind made upon the Equity Courts is not encouraging.
Lord ST. LEONARD'S has given notice of some further amendments, which appear to us to have the effect of making the impossible Divorce BiU which the LORD CHANCELLOR has introduced a judicious and salutary law. He excludes the LORD 'CHANCELLOR'S scheme for spontaneous divorce, but proi-des that after a woman has been deserted by her husband for a year her earnings and her property shall become her separate estate. This provision goes to mitigate the crying cruelty of our present law. Lord ST. LEONARD'S is in possession of Mr. MACQUEEN'S book upon the law of France, and he will find from the returns and from the statements of French jurists that it is safe and profitable to deal largely and boldly with the husband's right to sell his wife's goods and to demand her earnings. A ZFrench washerwoman pestered by an idle, drunken husband, wipes the soap off her arms, leaves her work for half an hour, and returns with a certificate which protects her wages; an Englishwvoman has no resource but to make terms with the vagabond. So long as he only robs her, and does not do her violenee, the law and Lord CRANwoRTH's Bill hold him to be acting in his right.
Perhaps the most singular omission in the Government Divorce Bill was leaving the action of crini. con. surviving. If there was any point upon wbhich all men of aU parties were agreed it was that, this action is a stigma upon our morals and upon our national character. The degradation of being plaintiff in such an action can only be excused by the necessity imposed by the law of going through the ordeal to obtain a divorce. The proposed Bill removes the necessity, yet suffers the action to exist. With the rather difficult question of providing a substitute for this
action Lord ST. LEONARD'S deals warily. He proposes, after abolishing the action for crim. con., to make adultery with a mairied woman a misdenieanour, punishable by fine on the prosecution of the husband. The fine so imposed is to be a CRowN debt, but capable of being partly or wholly applied by the Court to the costs of the divorce proceedings. If the husband should not choose to prosecute, a further amendment proposes to give the Divorce Court jurisdiction to entertain the question of an adulterer's guilt. The Court is to have power to impose a fine not exceeding 5001. at the same time that it dissolves the marriage, and may appropriate the money to the payment of costs or to the CRowN. These suggestions seem to touch all the most prominent faults both of commission and omission in these two bills. They meet the -objecfns made by Lords CAMPBELL, BROUGHAM, LUYNDIUPST, and ST. LEoNARD's; they have the authority of these great lawYers, and they approve themselves at once to our common sense. Yet, 'with these amendments before him, Lord Cw.AworTH gives notice that he shall introduce his old Bills early next session with very glight alterations. Ten weeks hence, therefore, -we may expect to see another shipwreck of a good cause. Our LORD CHfNCELLOR is a living antithesis to our solar system-a dark, central sun, with luni-
naries rtvolvinbg round him, playing iupon him light which he does not appear. to absorb, and certainly does not reflect.

BENEVOLENT SOCIETY OF ST. PATRici.-Yesterday eveuing the 74th anniversary festival of this exeellent cbaritable institution was held at the Freemasons' Tavern. The blarquis of Lnndonderry presided, supported by the Earl of Annesley, Viscount Mzansereene and Ferrard, Lord Duff'erin, Sir Cusack P. Roney, r. Commissioner Murphy, dc. An excellent dinner was served in the most admirable style, and at its conclusion, and after the usual loyal and patriotic toasts, the noble chairman gave the toast of the eveniog, urginlg the claims of the charitv upon his audienceewith considerable warmth of feelimg. From a report which was distribnted round the room it appeared that the income of the society during the past year had amounted to 1,8121. 2s. 10d. The expenses for the same period had falen short of that asnount by 1701., which remained a balance in the hands of the treasurer. The report also stated that the general interest felt in the charity had not, diminished, and the schools at present contained the full nuiniber of pupils which they could accommodate-viz., 500 (:300 boye and 200 girls). The comnittee, however, regretted to observe that a large number of children were now withdraw n from the sehools at a very early age, the poverty of their parents and the increased cost of most of the necessaries of life being probably the cause of this premature employment of children's labour. To preventthis thecommitteewereearnestlylooking forward to the tinme when the funds would admit of their providing some portion of the children food even to the extent of one meal a-day during the winter months, which would not only be regarded as a great boon, but would enable many parents to leave their children in the schools who are now impelled by poverty to remove them to any employment, however undesirable, which offers the temptation of some small weekly wages. The subscriptions amounted to upwards of 7501. Other toasts of a complimentary nature followed, which were briefly acknowledged, and the proceedings terminated early and with much dcldt. The musical arrangements vere most excellent, and Mr. Bankes made a most genial and effective toastmaster.
FEIIiuE RFeFORMAToty.-The foundation-stone of a new reformatory institution for girls was laid by the Mayor of Exeter, Mr. W. 3Buckingham, on Monday. A large number of influential ladies and gentlemen, from the city of Exeter and county of Devon, including Sir S. H. No:thcote, Sir M. Lopes (High-Sheriff of the county); AiIr. Commissioner Bere, and the Rev. Chancellor Martin, were present. The site for the institution is a very eligible one, and is situated in a large field, in St. Sidwells, Exeter. After the interesting' ceremony the sectators were addressed by Sir M. Lopes, r. J. hilford, the lav^r of Exeter, the Rev. Chancellor Martin and Sir S. H. Northeote. The latter gentleman statea that, while there were many reformatory institutions for boys in various parts of the country, there were very few for girls, and great difficulty had been experienced in placing girls convicted of offences in Devonshire in such institutions.
DiED iAT niS PosT.-The Joliet (Ilhinois) Deinocrat says :-" A sad, but beautiful and touching scene was witnessed at the accident of the Dn Page-bridgo. On the morning after the accident the slow tolling of a bell was heard. On looAing to see whence it came, it Was discovered to proceed from the engine, as it lay submerged in the water. The waves, as they foamed and surged over the sunken engine, swvayed the bell, which alone, with the smoke-pipe, appeared above water, and caused it to give a slowv tolling sound. When the engine was raised from the water the engineer was found in a standing posture, with his stiff, cold, icy hand firmly grasping the throttlevalve, as though amid the thick darkness he had discovered the perilous condition of the train, and had sprung to avert the ruin. But it was too late; the engine and train, with their precious freight of life and property, went down, and during the dreary night the engine-bell and the mad rushing waters rang out a solemn requiem for the dead ! It is probable that had not the freight train gono down as it did the passenger train from Chicago, due two hours later, and loaded with sleeping passengers, would itself have taken the fatal plunge."

AnuxDZL.-Lord E. H3oward basa again addressd his constituents. Hle expresses himself in favour of a policy of peace and reduction of taxation, and promise, if returned, to give them the support which an indepedent member of Parliament is able so offer.

BEDFor,D (BORtOUaH).-A formidable and unexpectedl oppositioni to the re-election of Captain Stuart, the Tory member, lisa been organised by the united sections of the Liberal party, a requisition, numerously signed, having been p-resented to Mr. Thomas Barnard, the banker, requesting him to contest the borough in conjunction with Mr. Samuiel Whitbread, the present IAberal representative. He has consented to stand, anud his address appears this morning. In his address Mr. Barnard says:
The vote that is the Immediate cause of the dissolution I regard with thaesame InJIguation that has been evinced in every quarter of thekingdom. and I believe the people, thsoughthe members returned to the new Parliament, will show that they will not allow the British name to be inijilted. nor the Ilves of their fellow-countrymen, who have gene abroad on the falth of treatiese, to be jeopardized only to Smit party purpozea or to grtify Individual jealous."
Hae is in favou-r of measures of reform, "especialy the extetsion of the franchise, total. abolition of church-rates. a large and liberal schr-me of education, andl a comprehensive plan of legal reformn."
Blqtwlci.-No les than four candidates are contesting the borough of Berwvick. The candidates are Mr. D. C. Marjorih2nks (one of thepresent members), Mr. John Stapletons, Air. Mlatthew Forster, and Captain Charles W.Gordon. Mr. John F'orster, the second menmber for the borongh, has intimiated his intention of retiring from the representation in f avour of his father, M1r. Matthew Forster. M. Matthew Forster states in bis address that he eagerly embraces the opportunity of endeavouring to renew those old and intimate political anda private relation. withthe borough of whichhe had never lost sight. He professes himself an advocate of civil and religious liberty, of commercial freedom, of law -reform, of popular education, of civil and social improvement, and of a wise extenision of the electoral franchise. Mr. Forster's remarlks on the late Parliamentary crisis axe as fullows :
" We have seen-a Mlinister and his colleague,, after bAsing sucess fully canted the country through ermbarrsasmenie caased by the wear anid timid Ds: licy- of their D'redecemsso, and thereby restored the foreign reputation of the natio., abrurtly aud reck~lessly defeated by a majority of the Houso of Commnoas, consisting of a factions and motley rup of won, many of whom niever met in the same divisiont lobby beore, and intent only on turning out the 31inistere, although incapable of formilng a Govemment ia place of that they sought to destroy. It is not by a pasesive submisson to insult and aggresaton that this country hees achievd its high position among the nationa, nor is Itby the craven policy that h as been recommended that that high position can be maintained. Forty yeass experience has taught me that the lives and welfare of our fellow subject abroad, porticulurly in semi. civilized conunties, depend mainly on the kn own power and determination of the Government to protect them. Feeling thus strongly the vital imporlaLCe of reversing tbe decision come to iastweebk, I trust 'hattheresultoftbeaspealn3owmsde tothecoDntryvwill be a House of Conmons mere consonant with the national feelngs and the national honour-a. House maore devoted to the busiune of the country than to facttion-one in which we shall not see feur days and nLights w.asted in futile and puerile debate on an anti-nationa mnotion, ending in A decisio which has been hailed as a triumph by the enemies of E.'eland, of liberty, and of civilisatlou, as calculated to discredit Isuiular Government and paralyze our foreign inftoencs.~'
Mr. Stapleton in his address states that if elected he will snport Lord Palmierston in uphLolding the honour of the Britith flog. Mr. 31arioribansg states that he is an advocate of religious toleration, of asound and liberal education for the people, of public economny, for the ballot, and for the abolition of church-rates. Thouigh a sincere PReformer, however, he says he is "o~nyrmprcile an upholder of wonted sights, property, andI privileges.' Captain Gordon, the cousin of the Earl of Aberdeen, has been brought forward by thie Conservatives, anad in the struggle of the three liberals they expect to sendl hin to Parliament to oppose Lordl Palmoraton.
BEVERLEY.-WO find that we inadvertently fell into an error in st-ating that Mr. G. W. Hastings, who some days s,ince issued on addres for this place, is a nominee of the B allot Society, wvith which we find lie bas no connexion.

Liea principles. The conitest will lie between Mr. Coniughamj and Lord Alfred Hervey, both of whom have comnmenced a personal canvass, The lengthened services of Sir G. B.

That gentleman has conditionally prom.'ised to do so, and has issgued an address in -whic Io prfesses "advanced liberal principles."

PI have heard tat a *few-a Tery few-o'f the Constituenry ae displeasedwith my wilful absence from the late dividon on Mr. Cobden7, resolution. I acted as I did because I did not aDprove any anom,. Ions conJunction of discordant pasrties, united for the purpoe of over throwing Lord Panmerston. Still morn did I disapprove of the rem. lution itelt. inasmnuch as I looked upon it as tending toendanger gbo lives and jeopardize the property of Xcglihbmen in theoe dishact parts, and even to hazard the prestige of our power In the Est."

Graham, the other member, who was elected in 1852 after a very severe contest, has evidently no chance of being again returned, the xpecial local causes which beforo operated in his favour being no longer in force; and the Hon. Frederick James Tollemache, a brotber of the Earl of Dysart, who has represented the borough in the four Parliaiments preceding that of 1852, and who is a Liberal-Coneervative of a steaduily-advancing character, and very poplar in the borough, will be again returned with MIr.

HERTyORDSHigR.- Sir Henry Meux, for the fourth time, offers himself for re-election. On the Chinese question Sir Henry observes:-
I I could conscentiously arrive at no other conclusion than that the hostie proceedings of Sir J. Bowrlng, ba sed solely upon the fact of the seinire of the Arrow, which alone I conceire to have been the resolution submitted to the House of Commons, Were untenable. A more ardent supporter than mye'lf of the honour of Old England cannot exsK snd the recent inteulgence from China respecting the state of affairs there secures to Lord Palmereton my unhositAing support in any meosure which may be necessary for the speedy and effectual termination ot the war, and the concludon of a peace upon termsbhich wiU be consistent with tht. dignity of Gret Britain and the commercial tnterests of her inhabitant."
The hon. baronet considers himself a Liberal-Conservative and willing to give his supportl notwithstandiing party ties, to any good sneasure emanating from LordPalmerston.
HONITON.-Sir James Weir Hogg has arrived in this borough, and announced himself a candidate for re-election. 31r. Locke, the other member, is also in the field; and. although an opposition is threatened, the two present members will in aU probability be re-elected.

KENT (EAST).-Sir Edward C. Dering, Bart., again comes forward with Mr. Wiliam Deedes. No other candidate is at present in tie field. Sir Edward is now abroad for the improvement of his health.
LEcxusm .-A very large meeting of the supporters of Sir J. Walmsley and Mr. J. Biggs was held at the New-hall. Wellington-street, Leicester, on Monday evening. The meeting was more especially convened to obtain a manifestation of the public feeling with regard to Sir J. Walmsley in consequence of there being a third candidate in the field of the samae political bias, in the person of Mr. J. D. Harris. On the present occasion the chair was occupied by Mr. Alderman Toller. In the course of a long address Sir Joshua referred to the animadversions which had been made upon hisypolitical career, and proceeded to advert and justify his proceedings with regard to the opening of public institutions in London on the Sabbath. That movement, he said, was based upon an earnest desire to sustain the right of private judgment and religious equality. He wasfree toadmiit, however, thatwith such an expression of ublic ooinion as was evinced in opposition to the measure, ne shonld be perfectly unjustifiable were he to bring it, under existing circumstances, again before the consideration of Parliament. But, at the same time, he was bound to say, and he said it with honest sincerity, that he had not altered his own opinion on that question one iota. With regard to the Chinese question, he did not concur in all the actions of our officials in China, because he believed that, by more prudent management, by more caution, and by more forbearanoe, much of that blood and treasure which had been spent might have been avoided. He, however, was not prepared to unite in a vote of censure against a Government which had refused to condemn its officials abroad without knowing all the circumstances which had led to the disastrous proceedings at Canton. He eulogized Lord Palmerston for his conduct during the late war, and observed that he would lwithhold his support from the men who had formed themselves into a coalition to overturn his Administration,-men who bad plunged us into the late war, and then deserted us in the time of need. Mr. Biggs, as an independent representative of this constituency, intimated hi firm adherence to Lnrd Palmerston's policy, so far as it had reference to the Chinese question, and spoke at length from personal observation of the humane character of Sir John Bowring. A resolution was then adopted approving the conduct of the two candidates, and pledging support at the ensuing election to secare their return.
Licso3iELD.-Viscount Sandon solicits a renewal of the confidence of the electors as an independent *ad cordial supporter of Lord Palmerston's Government. In his address the noble viscount observes, on the Chinese question,
" When Mr. Cobden propoeed to disavow the conduct of Britis. representatives in Ohlua I sav e the paDers on the subject my best consideration, and being satt sfied that the course taken by our seDrerentatives was justifiable, and, probably, unaovidable, and that no Government could have witbheld fro m them their complete approval, I determiced t0 vote against the motion. Even If I bad ashrel the conscientious sacrnples of members of AU lirties in the House. whieb I found were to be worked upon for party purpose and unsed as weapons sgainst Her Majesty's Government, I at least could not )oeget that Lord Palmerstoa, as the head of that Oovermment, had In 'he crisis of the late war reinvigo rated the wavering o0uncils of England."
MA-cHs;sTrs.-At a numeroug meeting of Messrs. Gibson and Bright's committee, held yesterday, Mr. G. Wilson presiding, Mr. S. P. Robinson, the secretary, announced that the sujoined address to the electors of Manchester had just beenreceived from Mr. Bright.
" Gentleme.-Intelllgence having reached me here that a dissolution of Parliament b immediately expected in consequence of the decision of the House of Commons with regard to theevets hbich hare recently tasen place at Canton, It is my duty at onoe to address Yon, that I may not leave You in sny doubt as to the comse I am prepa3ed to take at the coming election for your city.

* TORIcT;ouT.-This borough is to be contested at the forthcoming election, the vote of no confidence in Lord M1onek at last Wednesday night's meeting, nd the vote of Sir Francis Baring against Lord Palmerston, having stirred up a determination on the part of a large and very important section of the constituency to look out for other men to come forward.

SALISBURY.-A third candidate is now in tho field in the person of hlr. James Campbell. In his address ho says he should have voted In favour of the Govemment on the Chinese question-that he is an advocate of voting by ballot-in favour of the extension of the borough suffrage-and of Mr Locke King's motion for increasing the county constituencies-and opposed to chutrch-rates and the MIaynooth grant.

Lord Alexander Lennoxc also conmes forirard again. There is no opposition to the return of the two candidates.
STA.FFORDSU5RE (SouTri)-The retirement of the Earl of Uxbridge and the Hon. Mr. Littleton having been announced a meeting of the Liberal electors of 'he division was held at the Swan Hetel, Wolverhampton, on Monday, to eonsider the claims of various gentlemen who had been named as their successors. Ultimately it was unanimously agreed that Mr. William Mathews, ironmaster (brother-inlaw of the late Mr. Thomas Attwood), was a fit and proper person to represent South Staffordshire in Parliament - and that gentleman reluctantly consented to stand, shoaid no more competent candidate in the Liberal interest come forward. As a second candidate, the names of the Hon. F. Caithorpe, the Hon. Mr. Wrottesley, and Mr. Foley, the son of Mr. Hodgetts Foley, AL.P, were mentioned; but the consideration of the claims of these gentlemen was postponed until another meeting. There is not likely to bo any opposition.
STP.OUD.-In *addressing the electors of Stroud, Mr. Horsman, referring to the Chinese war, said, he did not hesitate to Lay that he looked with great regret and even disapproval on some of those proceedings. He thought the attack on any people, more particularly a defeneeless one, was one of thon most responsible acts that could be committed by the representativb of any Government. When Sir John Bowring felt there had been an outrage committed on the British flag, to submit to which wotild have endatngered the lies and property of all European residents, he might have been satisfied with takln one of their war junks, and then, without any loss of life, battering down one of the forts, which would have been, as far as the public eye of China was concerned, a reprisal for the insult, and then he might have remained quiescent until he had renmtted the question to the Home Government for consideration. He believed that if the electoral body or the non-electoral population, or the House of Commons Vero polled, this would be the opinion of nine-tenths of all classes of the eommunity. We were a peace-loving and a Christian community, and, such was our hatred of anything like aggressive proceedings, involving bloodshed and injury to others, that the people would have suffered almost anythinz rather than have engaged in the first inshince in such serious reprisals. But, that being the case, the question which the Government had to consider was not what Sir J. Bowring had done, but what they were to do when the news reached them of his proceedings. They were in this positionThe Chinese were a people whom the slightest encouragement was certain to incite into stiUl greater and more furious proceedings. AU our forbearance they would put down to fear, and the more we tolerated anything savouring of insult, the miore certain they would be to repeat it. The Government felt that when tho difficulty had occurred the speediest and easiest way of restoring peace and putting an end to all that was embarrassing was at once to send out reinforcements to check the Cainese, and to treat with them on powerful terms, at the same time to take the earliest opportunity of terminating hostilities. There was a great difference between the Government having sent out instructions to Sir John Bowring and his acting in arcordance with these instructions, and his having acted without the knowledge of the Government, leaving them to decide which wasthe est way to get out of the scrape. The Government having these two courses before them took the course which in the eyes of the Chinese would be the most manly, and the most speedy in coming to a termination, and the best calculated to increase the valuable trade we have with that country. The people of this country were pretty unanimous in the support of the Government, but th.e Government was beaten by a combinationof parties. It had been said that the people of England abhorred coalitions, and the question for tho constituencies now to decide was between the Government of Lord Palmoerston, by whom the war had been terminated in Russia, and by whom he trusted this war would be speedily terminated in China, and the noble Lord's political opponents who had come in on opposite principles. Ir. M Mt. Tulrner has issued an aduress announcing his intention of opposing the return of Mr. Horsman and Mr. Scrape. He says,-

SUFFOLK (EAST).-Lord Henniker has issued an address anuncing his intention of again presenting himself to the electors. Sir Fitzroy Kelly has also issued an address in which he defends the vote he gave on tho Canton affair in opposition to the Government,
SURREY (EASr).-Mr. H. Drummond solicits re-election. In his address he says:-
"It Is not posdble at this ditdance from the wat of striro to disavow Sir J. Bowrlngs acts, becuse the Chtteee world mistake tbis for the effect of fear, and woald he enonuraged to make systematto resvtance.
bhe course whIcb I adopto I, therefore, was the safest-namely, to mupport Lord Palmerston, whether I approred or not of the conduct of his agent. I have in this, as at alt other times, been astuated by an impartl desire to suDport the Qaeen's Garernment, however cmpoged, whenerer the mnares Prop)e by them vere gucl as, fairly interpreted, appeared to deserve support. while I have mnvr shrunk from in opposition to tbem whenever the cour;a they took seemedlikely to endanger the interestsotthe oumntry."
SUSSEX (EAST).-There are four candidates in the fieldd two Liberals and two Tories-viz., Mr. Fuller, Lord Pevenroy, MIr. John George Dodson (who contestod the county
at a former election), and Mr. . W. Frederick Cavendish.
Each candidate has issued an address, and the contest threatens to be severe. At the late Ezst Sussex election Lord Pevensey polled 2,3;02 votes, and MIr. Dodson 2,234, out of a total number of 6,U4 registered voters.
TU-\rol.-On Monday 5Mr. A. 3ills, the Conservative candidate, addressed the electors in explanation of his views. He said be would have " endorsed the opinions of the Government " if ho hadhad an opportunity of voting on
the Chinese question in the House of Commons, and eulogizcd Lord Palmernton asea Minister who would maintain thehonour of his country at home and abroad." The Ron. W. F. Campbell (Liberal) also addressed the electors from the balcony of the Castle Hotel, expressing his entiro confidence in Lord Palmerston, and promising to support " lU those liberal measures which had been so long maintained by their senior m ember." Mr. Labouchere, who arrived some time afterwards, also addressed the electors.
TzwKxSiBuR.-On bMonday night a meeting of Liberal electors was held here to hear Mr. Brown's statement of principles. The chair was taken by Mr. Blisard, an elector, and M1r. Brown spoke at some length, but did not aUude

Report On The Customs Department.-Yes-
RLEPORT ON TH CUSTOmS DEPARTI1M-T.-Yeg.- terday appeared a smaU blue-book, of 100 pages and upwards, containing the first report of the Commissioners of Customs on the Customs Department. The report, of which, from its nature, it is difficult to give a digest, treats nthe orin and formation of the Customs Department tself-the members, costt and functions of the department, the facilities and ditninution of Customs work, the facilities and concessions given to trade, on smuggling, and on that inctcase of commerce and revenue. The report gives a rcsumc of the Ilterations and charges effected Ilst year. Thero are copious and valuable appendices to the report. The commissioners (pp. 37 and 38) refer to the vast increae in the commerce of great Britain, under the simplification of our tariff the reduction of duties, and the facilities afforded to mercbants and shippers. They show that between 1831 and 1834 the first extensive steps were taken towards the removal of prohibitions and the reduction and remission of duties. These were followed in 1842 and 1844 by still bolder advances in the' same direction, culminating in the vastly reduced. and simplified tariff of 1853. Now , tho net aggregate of these reductions amounts to above 10,000,0001., snd yet, notwithstanding, the revenue of the Customs bas scarcely varied for the last 20 years, steadilyranging from 22,000,001. to 23,000,0001. In 1835 the gross Customs income was 23,149,0G01., nd in 1855 23,482,000., or nearly identicaL ' In order to produce such a result," observes the report, " it is obvious that both the industry and the consuming power of the mass of the nation must have augmented in an extraordinary ratio." Statistics show that the official values of onr imports have increased from 314 millions (in 18141516) to 121-6 millions in 1853.4-5, the official value of our exports from 53 8 to 248-1 millions, and the real value of our exports of home produce and manufactures from 46 2 to 972 millions. The same encouraging tale of commercial progress is told by the tables of sbipping. Thus, the average tonnagc annually added was for 1823-4-5, 98,900; in 18534-5, it hadrisen to 413,900 tons, and this after the repeal of the navigation laws. " Under a continuance of the same wise system," continues the report, " we may hope for a continuance of the same satisfactory results. By a further reduction of duties on all articles of general consumption. as the condition of the finances may suggest aud permit, and by extending to commerce the utmost possible facilities cormpatible with tho security of the revenue, we may hopo to insure a progress in future as rapid and as signal as that of the recent past." Smuggling has declined with the reduction of duties, and " smuggliDg proper" is now almost entirelyconfined to tobacco, spirits (the duties on wlichare still notorioudLy exorbitant), and watches. Passengers from the Continent will still do a little smuggling business in lace and silk. but all these cases are on the decrease, although tbe habit of packing up contraband articles within the folds of ladies' dresses stili prevails ana occasions very disagreeable disputes. The valuo of our imports in 1855 was 117.402,3661.; and that of our exports 258,424,3941., ineluding 226.920,2G2L of our owin produce and snanufactures and 31,504,132, of foreign goods. The tonnage of the tota nlumber ofships entered inwards and cleared outwards isx 1856 was 21,589,049. The registered tonnage of the empire in1855 was35,92 vesselsof 5,250553tons, and carrying

PARIS, MA&CH 16, 6 PJ .M
The members of the Conference on the Neuchatel question are enjoying a long vacation, and no one can say when they will be ready to resume work. I mentioned a day or two ago that a note was addressed by the French Government to their Minister at Berlin, to be of course communicated to the Prussian Minister. It was, I am assured, couched in rather energetic terms, the sum and substance being, that if the King of Prusnia did not make up his mind to do something the Conference would go on without his representative. He will be dealt with as an accus6 who refuses to present himself for judgment, and will be tried, and I suppose sentenced, par contumace. M. de Hatzfeldt has received the instructions which he expected from Berlin; they are described as not likely to bring matters to a close, though they may afford occasion for a third meeting of the Plenipotentiaries, when it is to be hoped that somethina like business will be got through. The Swiss'Envoy has also received additional instructions from Berne.
A letter from Naples speaks of extensive public works projected in that country. In the meantime the Government agents are very busy constructing and repairing roads in Sicily, not mereiy for the sake of improvements, but as a means of preventing insurrectionary attempts in futare. Lighthouse are to be built along the coast, and ordershave been given that from the 1st of May next all the points of the island shall be put in direct communication with Naples. By that day also the submarine cable which is to connect the Two Sicilies will be laid down.
The rumour is again in circulation of a visit from the Czar to Paris. I am not aware that it rests on a sure foundation, though there is little doubt that M. de Morny and the Emperor sre very desirous that it should prove true. Perhaps the rumour originates in this, that in a conversation during an audience the Czar said he should be glad to see Paris, and that if State affairs allowed of his absence he should carry his desire into execation, and that among other interesting communications M. de Morny repeated these remarks.
Trade in Paris is beginning to give some signs of returning life. The shopkeepers, particularly those who deal in articles for ladies' dresses, find that the spring trade is commencing favourably, although the demand has been somewhat checked during the last two days in consequence of the wet and stormy weather. The accounts from tRoubaix, Rouen, and Lyons are more favourable, and zome large purchases have been made there on account of Paris warehousemen. The manufacturers at Lyons made scarcely any sales during the month of February, but now that their stocks are much reduced it required but a few orders to set all the mills going. Hopes of a reduction in the price of raw silk prevented many purchases, but now the demand is pressing, and the manufacturers will find some difficulty in completing the orders received within the limited time alowed. According to letters received from NIew York the importation of silks into that city during the week ending the 14th of February amnounted to $53,085 against $72,122 in the corresponding week of 1856. The high price of the article prevented sales. The value of other French manufactured goods imported into New York during the first 15 days of February amounted to $8,000,000, a figure never before reached. The corn trade is quiet, and there is no change to be remarked in prices at the print cipal market towns. At the last Paris market
holders of wheat stood out for an advance of 50 to 75 centimes the hectolitre, but they did not succeed, except for a few samples of very superior quality. White wheat from the north found buyers with difficulty at 29f. the hectolitre. Accounts from M-arseilles state that 400,000 hectolitres of wheat had arrived in that port since the 1st of February, and not more than 70,000 hectolitres remained unsold. Farmers are unanimously of opinion that the weather has been most favourable durng the last two months for the winter crops; and, although no considerable decline in prices is expected until the next harvest, buyers are not anxious to purchase at the present prices. Flour nevertheless maintains its price in the Paris market. The best marks were more firm on tlfe last market day than during the preceding week. They are quoted at 76f. oOc. and 77f. the sack of 167 kilogrammes, with little business doing. The bakers buy no flour on speculation, but the miUers have two reasons for not yielding. They have but a small stock of flour on hand, and they find the price of wheat too dear compared with that of flour. In the meantime the stock of flour in the reserved stores increases considerably. It amounts at present to 15,000 metrical quintals. Accounts from Algiers state that the weathor is very favourable for the growing crops. The opinion among speculators there is that prices must give way, and consequently there is little business doing. The price of wineisfirm at themarket of Bercy, nor is there any probability of a decline in prices until the quality and quantity of the nextvintage are ascertained. But, even should the vintage of the present year prove abundant, that will not be sufficient to produce a great fall, in consequence of the little stock on hand. A large quantity of Spanish
ine has lately been irnported into Cette,which was all disposed of without making any sensible effect on the price of French wines. Accounts from Bordeaux state that there is but little doing in the wine market. The weather has been extremely favourable there for the growth of the vine.

AUSTRIA.
(FROM OUR OWN CORSFPONDBET.)
VIENNA, ARCH 14.
The Emperor and Empress yesterday evening went to the Burg (Palace) Theatre, where thev were received with great cordiality by an extremely select audience. As soon as a flourish of trumpets had announced the arrival of their Majesties the public rose as one man, and cheered loudly and long. The Emperor and Empress, who seemed to be in perfect health and excellent spirits, acknowledged the compEment paid to them by a series of low bows. The "reception" lasted severaliminutes, and even when it was over some little time elapsed before the actors on the stage were able to obtain a hearing. On their way back to Vienna the Imperial travellers paid a visit to the famous grotto of Adelsberg, which was brilliantly lighted up for the occasion. According to the Trzeste Zeitunqu, there were no fewer than 16,000 lights burning. Their Majesties passed rather more than two hours in the grotto, which is composed of several halls connected with each other by means of a labyrinth of passages. A military band, which was stationed in the so-called "Dome," struck up the Austrian Anthem as the illustrious visitors entered. Inthe "Ballroom," and near a monument erected to the memory of the Emperor Ferdinand I., who visited the grotto towards the middle of the 16th century, were 50 couples, dressed in the quaint costume worn by the peasants of Inner Carniola on Sundays and holydays, who danced to the music of the band of the workmen in the quicksilver mines of Idria. The two grottoes which were discovered a few years ago were, with the consent of their Majesties, named Francis Joseph and Elizabeth.
There is great reason to fear the Austrian Government Wll turn a deaf ear to the well-meant counsel of Englangd and France, and recall Count Paar from Turina The order has not yet been isued, but persons who are in a poition to know what is intended tell me that in a very few days the diplomacti relations between Sardinia and Austia wil be entliely broken off. A semi-official correspondent informs the Frankfort- Post Ze*wrng that the
3We Government considers it neither deirable nor advisable to keep a representative in a oountry 9fin which- att on the person of the Emperor, and the ihahitanh of Lombardy con-
tinually incited to rebellion against his authority." The wrath of tbis Government, an d-aiar stAted, of His Majesty, has been greatly roused by an article which secently appeared in the columns of the me -to. .The Sardinian paper states that the Grand Duke Constantine recently visited xome of those battle-fielda on which the Austriaus and Russians fought side by side against the forces of the first Napoleon. On being told that on a certaiu occasion the Austrians had run away at the very firat attack, his Imperial Eighness pronounced them to be "I swine" (cochons), and declared that it was invariably their habit to show their backs to their enemies. The members of the family of HapsburgLorraine have very retentive memories, and you may be sure that the observation of the Russian GrandDuke will never be either forgotten or forgiven.
In the course of this month the finishing touch will be put to the statutes for the future representation of Hungary. The Archduke Albrecht, as Governor-General of Hungary, will make known to the Emperor the necessities and wishes of the Hungarians; but it is not the intention of Government grant more extensive privieges to the Magyars than those enjoyed by the inhabitants of the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom. The " Estates " will be allowed to occupy themselves with provincial matters of minor importance, but they will have neither legislative nor executive power. In fact, the membera of the provinnial representation of Hungary wrill be neither more nor less than counsellors to thePresidents of the five "Statthaltereiene and to the Governor-General. The Emperor has conuented to let the Protestant clergy in Hungary hold a general Synod, and the measure is a wain one, for the Protestant part of the population of the province although but small, possesses very great inlluence. The unfortunate concordat will always be a thorn in the side of Government, and the truth of the remark will be seen as soon as guaranteeing the rights and privileges of the non-Catholic part of the population of the Empire is taken into consideration. The inhabitants of Temesvar believe that the Statthalterei in their city is about to be done away with, and the Banat and Voivodina restored to Hungary, but -they certainly deceive themselves. Hungay, when connected with the Banat and Voivodina, was avery large kingdom, and "Divide et impera" has always been a favourite adage with Austtan statesmen. In my letter of the day before yesterday it was said that no " calls" were likely to be made for the next 12 maonths on the subscribers to the various Austrian industriel undertakings, but reliable information has to-day been given me that the Credit Bank will form an exception.
At the beginning of April the French company, Matthis, Magnan, Parrot, and Co., will enter into competition wfith the Austrian Danubian Company OD the Lower Danube. The French are likely to prove very formidable rivals to tb Austrians for their prices are about 10 per cent, lower than those now paid by the public. The Lyonnais is still at Belgrade, and there she is likely to remain for a long time to come, as she has the guns of the fortress on board, and consequently requires an unusual depth of water. According to reliable private letters from Bucharest, the French are agitating in favour of the union. The Austrian and Russian Commissioners leave for the Wallachian capital on Monday, the 16th, but nothing whatever is known of Sir Henry Bulwer. The Moldavians and Wallachias are extremely desirous to have a free press while the elections are going on, and while the Divans ad hoc are sitting, but the Porto-probably at the instigation of Austria-is not inclined to grant the request of its Rouman proteg's. Could not Lord Stratford say a word in favour of the Moldavian and Wallachian press ? Several of the Paris correspondents of the German papers have written that Austria is no longer so much opposed to the union of the Danubian Principalities as she was a few weeks since, but the sequel wiU prove that they are marvellously il-informed.

RUSSIA.
(P203 oun nERL I coB3SonDrzT.)
BERLIN, IA co 15.
Some few scraps of information about China that have lately attracted my attention in the Russian press may, perhaps, have unusual interest at the present moment. Thus a communication made to the Journal of tle Academy, dated from the Chinese frontier, states that the rebellion in China Is continually on the increase, more particularly in the south; the only portion of the empire not affected by it appears to be the province of Fu-Tsian, and a few of the other tea-producing provinces. The capital itself (Pekin) is debed as though on the pomnt of breaking up altogether into a social chaos; no taxes were being received from the insurgent provinces; the Imperial coffers were empty, and the servants of the Glovernment could no longer obtain any pay. Silver is stated to have totally disappeared from the market, and of copper there was next to none to be had, so that the Government had been driven to coin iron money. The Court of Pekin is described further as totaly at its wits' end, but nothing shows whether this not very wonderful state of intellect had been caused by the insurrection of its own subjects or by the "insolence of the barbarians." Furthermore it is averred that demoralization and corruption have reached their highest degree. In the absence of any collateral evidence either to substantiate or to modify these statements, I willat least mention that aJl the descriptions of the progress of affairs in China that have met my eye coming from a Russian source evidently betray a desire to represent China as heretofore the Emperor Nficholas represented Turkey, in the condition of a valetudinarian breaking up very fast.
The so-called "Clerical Mission" which the Russian Government is entitled by the terms of the treaty concluded between Russia and China, January 14, 1728, to maintain in Pekin, is about to undergo an entire change of its component personnel. Formerly the persens appointed to it remained a very long time on the station, but of late their period of service has been reduced to 10, and again to seven years. Those who are now about to be relieved by the new comers have been out there since 1849. The ostensible object of this "C clerical' mission is the preservation of the pawivoslavwnaja wera (orthodox faith) in the bosoms of the descendants of certain Russians who were taken prisoners in 1685 at Albasin, on the Amour, and carried to Pekiu, where they were formed into a body-guard for the Bog,dokhan. The mission consists of an Archimandrite, together with both secular and clerical officials. On this occasion, as well as on all others, certain men of letters and of science are attached to the nmisaion. Of the results of its labours the public has had within the last three years an opportunity of judging by the publication in St. Petersburg of several volumes of its Transactions. In the course of November last inquiries were iade in Eiachta as to the expense of forwarding the luggage, &c., of the fresh mission from that place to Kalgan. Its weight was stated to be 1,500 pouds, or 60,000lb., among which itwasanderstood was a considerable quantity of silver. The town of Kiachta has of late become an important place in consequence of the greatly increased traffic between Russia and China. It has been selected to be the capital of that part of the
trontier region, and is to be honoured bry having a military commandant and a civil governor. A direct and regular postal communication for official despatches has lately also been established between that frontier town and the Chinese capital, which is distant 2,820 Ii, or about 900 English miles; this postal communication seems to have been necessitatedby theofficial intercos between Russia and its clerical and diplomatic missions in Pekin, which are just now making a rich harvest of advantages from the embarrassments of the Chinese Government. The insurrection had hardly shown itself to be of importance in 1853, when Russia began to apply for concessions, which consisted eventually in the free navigation of the Amour, and a certain portion of territory at its mouth,whichhas probably bythis time been extended to the whole. northern bank. By means of these acquisitions Russia is now enabled to lead an army to Pelin either from the north, or in the summer time down the Amour in small river steamers, which she already possesses there and thence to the Peiho River, whence it would arrive at Pekin,fromthe south.
Letters received in St. Petersburg from the Crimea mention that preparations aro being made there on the return of fine weather to commence the restoration of the different towns that suffered during the
late war, the rt and foremost of these are Kertch, EGupatoria, and Sebastopol. According to all accounts, the present appance of these towns differs but little from what it was when the allied forces
evacuited the Crimea. The necesssr m aterals for building are being oiweyed thither by sea from Nicholaieff, whic may belooked on now as the chief emporium for the Taurian peninsula, or from Odessa, which, as a commercial centre, still seems to hold its vantage ground.
The 17 " equipages " of the Black Sea fleet that took part in the defence of Sebastopol have received from the Emperor flags with the Cross of St. George, and the inscription, " For the defence of SebastopoL"
Before he set off on his visit to Germany ths Grand Duke Constantine carried out a great alteration in the organization of the fleet. Formerly it was divided into " divisions," each of which consisted of three "brigades ;" the " divisions" wera commanded by vice-admirals, the "brigades" by rear-admirals. According to the new arra4gemeun introduced by the Grand Duke, the construction o- b'rigades is given up, and the commanders of bri gade3 are attached to the commanders of divisions. One result of this new arrangement is a greater concentration of the command and greater facility for action. Two exceptions from this general abolition of brigades are formed by the Caspian Brig,ade and the 10th Brigade of the Baltic Fleet, which, however, takes now the name of the " igVht Brigade." Another of the Grand Duke's recent alterations in the organization of the Baltic Fleet consists in the abolition of the "equipage" of enginemen and. stokers, and providing every crew with a separate " company" of machinists, as they are called. With great forethought and provision for the great increase of the steam fleet that is about to take place, itis also arranged that each vessel shall for the present bear on its books twice as many " machinists" as the ordinary complement requires. The Baltic fleet has already since the conclusion of peace received a reinforcement of 9 frigates, 14 corvettes, and 100 gunboats, all screw steamers; there are also more screw steamers spoken of as being built for the Russian Government in Bordeaux and in Liverpool; in Archangel, in Abo, and in Cronstadt, a still further number of light draught screw steamers are on the stocks, so that the Russans flatter themselves they shall soon be a match for any enemy in their own waters. The naval department has contracted for 1,200,000 cwt. of English coals to be delivered this year for the use of the fleet in St. Petersburg, Cronstadt, Revel, Abo, and ArchangeL
At Cronstadt there has been a new shooting gaUery erected to enable the naval officers to keep up their shooting practice undisturbed by the rigoar of the climate; and the Grand Duke himself drew up a carefully-considered set of regulations with regard to this shooting practice, sO that it would seem impossible for any officer to escape complying with his intentions. One of the regulations here introduced is that every officer shall make use of his own firearms at the practices or at the shooting matches, and thus it is made in some degree a point of honour with them to procure good arms. It is believed at Cronstadt that the numerous alterations and reforms that have been made in the fleet of late are but the prelude to still more numerous changes. Not only is the Grand Duke Constantine himself now travelling about, and carefully profiting by every opportunity of seeing foreign maritime affairs, but also the Admirals Putiatin and Glasenappe, and a number of other naval officers of rank, are journeying about with like intent, and it has been observed that from time to time these coryp7Mes of the fleet meet, and confer with their Imperial cdef.

NAPLES, MAGHc 10.
My last letter gave you an account of the decree which the Liberals posted up in the King's name. Some expression of feeling was anticipated on the publication of the Roysl amnesty, popularly called the "Thieves' Amnesty," as it turns loose, contrary to my first impression, a grea' number of those gentry. Guards were placed, therefore, during the whole of Tuesday night in the streets, but, as nothing had been done, they became careless towards the morning. It was between 8 and 9 o'clock, then, that a man might be seen here and there, enveloped in a large cloak, draw from beneath its folds a placard, and, hurriedly sticking, it on the walls, run on. In one instance the person was seen by a Gendarme, who followed him closely, but, turning sharp round, the man presented a pistol, and, taking advantage of the hesitation of his pursuer, escaped up an entry. Several arrests are spoken of, as that of an old woman who was standing by one of the placards, and, seeing it hang down, attempted to replace it; a gentleman, while reading it, took off his hat with exultation, and was imprisoned two days. An Englishman, who has a saddler's shop in the Toledo, was also taken poqsession of under the following circumstances:He had come out to read a placard which was posted on one of the legalized places, when a commissary of police, standing close by, said that it was not permittedto do so. " It is on a place sanctioned by the law," observed the Englishman, "and I will read it." "I will put you under arrest if you do so." " Do as you like," was the reply, ";but read it I will;" and with that be removed the commissary's hand, which, having doubled up the decree, was placed upon it. The commissary immediately ordered a policeman to lay hold of him. "You may do what you like with me now," was our countryman's observation, " for I have read the placard; bat, remember, I am not a Neapolitan subject; I am an Englishman." The commissary fell back, the policeman was ordered to release him immediately, and the guardian of the spurtious decree, excusing himself to the prisoner, begged him to go where he liked. The empjoygs in one of the public offices were discussing its merits in the full belief of its truth, but all concluded that it was not worth anything, as no promise of the Bourbons could be relied on. Indeed, had the placard remained an hour longer on the wals the consequences would have been most serious, for it was just the spark calculated to ignite the!mine which ies under our feet. I beheve that many copies were sent into the provinces, and so clever was the counterfeit that et deserves to be recorde I as one of the most pungent and damaging efforts made against misgovernment. The " Thieves' Amnesty," tO use the popular term, replaced the spuriou decree, but in many places it was torn down or bedaubed with mud. 1 myself saw policemen standing on guard beneath the Royal decree, to ward off all damage, and the same precaution was continued throughout the night. I am informed that on the Marina the p,ortraits of the King and Queen, on being taken down after the illuminations, were insulted. Of the posting up of tricoloured placards and the distribution of tricoloured cockades aud papers I have alreadyspoken. A man tells me that on AshWednesday, very early in the morning, he was passing near the Strada San Pasquale, and observed a fisherman gathering up small cockades which were scattered about the street. He might have collected his two hands full. " I advised him," said the mnan, " to conceal them in a hole-which he did." I hear of many practical jokes having been played. The Neapolitans lare a clever witty people, and there can be little doubt but that they will exhaust every means for bringing their Government into ridiecule.

Sir,-In T7ie Tirms of this date there is a letter from Sir John Hall, referring to LordPalmerston's speech of the 12th inst., and containiag certain observations on the proceed. ings of the Sanitary Commission in the Crimea, in reply to -which I should feel obliged by your permitting me to say a few words.
It is quite true, as stated by Dr. Hall, that the commission had nothing whatever to do " with either the organization or management of the military hospitals." We wete, in fact, precluded by our instructions from ints - fering with these matters. But we were required to see that the sanitary condition of the hospitals, as to ventib'tion, drainage, water supply, number of sick, &c,, was such aa to give fair scope to the medical treatment. We had also to see to the removal of all sanitary defectg in the camps and at Balaklava.
The report of the proceedings of the commisimon has been for some timein the hands of theprinter, and will be pxb. lished very shortly. It gives all the detafis of the sanitary work done, both in the Crimea and at the hospitals on tle Bosphorus.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

STOURTO2 V. SqOmTmT(7
(Bffore fhe LORDs JuseICS or AArP )
This appeal from an order of the Master of the Rolls was heard oin the 20th a'nd 28th of February now last, and was reported in Ties Ti7e. The facta arek shortly that the late Hon. John Stourton on his mnarriage settled i0,0001. uprn himself for life, then uponL the wif~e for life, and ultimately .(iu the events W'hich have happened) in trast for the only child of the marriage, a son aged nine years and 10 maonths The father, who was brother of thepresut Lord Stourton, died in Mfay, 1847, and the child was born seven days af terwards. The husband and the wife were Roman Catholies, but the latter about 182 ceased to bea member of that comninnnion, and soon afterwards became a member of tho church of England. Up to the time of the lady'sseession from the Roman Church the child had been allowed to attend at places of worship of that faith, the chapel at Stourton and other places; but subsequently to that event it had been educated, 'with the foil knowledge of and without say -reanonatrance from the relations of the father, inL the tenets of the church of England, and was now placed in the care of a Mr. King, a Master of Arts of Trinity College, Cambridse. at his house, at Bihton. The lady in her affidavit a'id that she had abjuedthe Roman Church because she canacientioussy disbelieved the doctrine of tranustbstantiation, and she had carefully educated her child from his earliest years in the doctrines of the church of England.
After the hearing their Lordship saw san conversed with the infant and reservedl jndgment, and for that purpose the case etood this mnorning on the paper.
Lord Justice KwinGHT Bnucs, in giving juLdgmaent in this case, respecting the guardianship of a young gentleman of ten years of age, said that the main or only question in dis-
te as wheherthe infant should be brought up in the Rulho h -man Catholic or in the faith of the Aglican Church. The Master of the Rolls had decided in favour of the latter view, but he didanot see the infant. The infant, who, by his fathepr as his next friend, was plaintiMwas a boy of a delicate constitution, and was -thei posthumaous child and sole issue of his father, the late Mr. John Stourton, one of the sons of the late Lord Stourton, who were both of the Roman Catholic persuasion. There had been no praof adduced before theo Court that his (the infant's) father did not wish him to be brought up as a Romnan Catholic. His mnother was originally, and professed to be, like his father, a pa pist, hut she had beeni for four or five years past a mnember of the c'hurch of England, and her son, the ba' in
nestion, was and is bv educatoio and triiganAgia
rotestant. Considering that the religon of the late husband of Mrm StAourton and of the Stourton family is that of the Roman Catliilic faith, it was perhaps surprising th%t
thscourse should have been permitted withoutt interference on their behalf until the autumn of last year; and that, although the order of the Master of the Rolls appoDinting a Protestant mother the sole guardian was made in November, no appea was presented until Februar was a matter of srprse There could be no doub bthat t et boywou ehve ben brought up a Roman Catholic if the family had successfully interfered with his bringing up, but they omitted to take any steps in thermatter until October, 1856. With regard to themother there was no deceit or concealment proved against her. In the last of the affidavits Mrts. Stourton had made she said that while staying in 1850, 185-4 and 182 at Lord Stourton's set she did attendl the chapel of his residence;- but Rhe did niot in 1852, nor, as she believedl, in 1851, com muni-
cte there accrding to the rites of the Roman Catholic church, because she did not believe, and she does not still believ,in the Rtoman Catholic doctrine of trausubstantiation; se further said that Lord Stourton and the priest both knew of her sentimentS, and there dlid not appear to his Lordship any reason to disbelieve her statement, The bill filed was substantially for the appointment of a guardian, and was filed by Lord Stourton as the next friend of his nephes-, but thiit bill was not filed until the end of 1858; but Lord Stourtonx had been head of the family for nine years or more. The order of tho Master of the Rolls appointed Caroline Emmaz Stourton the sole guardian of the boY durn his minority, or until further order; but his Honour did not add any directions as to the maintenance or education of the infant. The reason for that omissiounmight be that MrsM. Stourton had mnanifeste her unwillingness to bear these expenses out of her own income. Lord Stour. ton, in one of his affidavits, declared. his wlige to maintain and educate his nephew in the Roa aatoi faith without any other Lssistlance than might arise from his (the infant's) own income. These competitors for the infant's spiritual direction gave notice of appeal from the order of the Master of the Rolls. In his Lordship's opinon there had been a failure of duty to the late Mr. Stourxon. Application might have been made to the Court at a timie before the mind of the Infant had, been blasmed upon religious sub' jects, and had such a cours been adopted there could he no doubt that the religion of the father would have "ae allowed to prevail. At the close of the argument hisLordship thought it posuble that the opinions of the mother, a convert to Protetntis, would have had such an efrect unon the infant's mind as to lead him to show an inclination to the church of England. Hlis Lordship, and an-o his learned brother, considered it corret to see and converse with the infant, and hIds Lordship epected to find hi-m, to use a colleiat phrase, "1crammed or the occason. Hlis
Lordship hadno expectation or anticipation that thein
fant's answers would be such as the7 were to the questions which were put to him. His intelligece was rather above than below mnediocrity, and he appeared to hare more insight than boys of his age usualy have into the import&nt
qustions upon which difference of opinion existed between the Roman Catholic and the Angliean church,-suchs, for instance, as the doctrine of trausubstantiation, the practices relating to the Virgin Mary, and as to the invocation of saints. Those imPressions made upon his mind were
sostrong that it was essential to his tranquillty and health that they should not be disturbed, and it was also unsfe, havingregarclto hisspiritulweLmre, that any attemptshould be made to ext~irpsate them. His Lordshlipnight regret the necessiLt of not mnterfering, considering the religion of the father, but it was not unmixed with mi3tigation, seeing that the infant would not, if undisturbed, consider that his mother had led him into error, or that she would herself become a "1castaway." Hisimpressions his Lordship could not consent to displace ; butt the maother must understand that she was not at liberty to remove her son from England without the leave of- t-he Court; and she must also consent to maintain and educate him. The question whether any other person should be associated withi hirs Stourton in the guardlanshciphadbeen considered, andwhether that otlierper. son should be Lord Stourton, who was the godlfather of the boy, and the head of the family. HisLordship, faowever, ha
signified an intention of bringinmg him up in a Jesuits' seminary,-an establishment which, from the prospectus in evidence, was no doubt a very excellent place for the children of persons whose mneans were such that economy was of importance. Whether that religions body were in aLny degree changed since the publication of the Ps-oiin~id Lettrs his Lordship did not kniow ; nor did he know whether they had been justly treated in theseletters. With regard,however, to a boy of 10 years of age, of a delicate habit of body, and so connected *as was this infant, the selection was, no doubt, somewhat singular, and he (the Lord Justice) endured no grief in not sending him there ; a remark he made without the slightest intention of showing disrespect to tbat ofl~u body. There was no doubt of the good intention
torton, but it was better that he shouldl not be associated with the mother in the guardianship, and it was gratifying to find that onx the part of the mother there was no sign of neglect or ilhiberality of or towards her late husband's family, and he the Lord Justice would join with his learnedabrother, with confidence, in committing the infant to her charge.
Lord Justice Tusc-Enn said, after stating the facts, which have been already reported, that the only objection made to Mrs. Stourton as guardian of her infant son was that she had brought hin up as an English Protestant. The principle of the Court with regard to infants who were its wards was not difficult to be ascertained. It was its first duty to consult the wellbeing of the infants committed to its charge, and in doing so no religions distinction was allowed. Where no testamentary guaraian had been appointed the Court had regad to the religious opinonsof the father, which were allowed to prevail, and this was grounded on the right the father ha by law over his child, and if his wishes could be ascertained upon that subject, those wishes would be complied with ; but if, as here, his opinion couldanot be as;certained-for lie died without stating any opinion on the
sbject-the Court could not so guide itsdli for the parties interested had not imimediately sought the aLid of the Coeurt. Here the famifly had not come early, and here the opinios Of the child upon religious matters had been fore by education and training, and the Couxrt would see whether its mind was really settled. Therefore, their Lordships hadasen the infant, and conversed with him, and bein stisfied that his mind had received strong impressions diffrent from the father's reliPious faith, had determined not to take aLny step to displace3 iLt. If it did, the danger was great that the endeavoars of his new preceptors might have the effect of wholly unsettling his religious inpressons, or, what was worse, of inducing him to profess coinpIliance where his real opinions had no-sympathy. But whet ertis efrect would follow or not he, the Lord Justice, did not dare to hazard such a thing, and therefore he should agree in declaring that the order of the Master of the Rolls, apiting Mrs. Stourton
sole guardian, was correct, and conld sot be disturbed.

(Before Vice-Chancelor Sir W P. Wr f
The VI-CHANcnrLLoR delivered judgment in this case, the hearing of which occupied the Coart for several guocessive days during the present sittings.
In order to render the judgment intoeigible it is nenes. ary to state very shortly the object of the suit. The plain. tif is one of the clans of second mortgagecs of tbe above canal by virtue of mortgages made by the Company pur. suant to their Act of Parliament. In the year 1845 possessan of the canal was taken by Reynolds, also one of the class of second mortga"ees (which clss consisted of some 20 persons). The position of Reynolds was that of a transferee from an original mortgagee under a transfer which (as allegoe by the bill) was a fictitious transfer for a nominal consideration made at the instigation of the com.pany for the purpose of enablin; him thus to tal- pos. sson, and thereby defeat tho right of the plaintiff i
respect of certain proceedings taken by him s a simplo contract creditor of the comp any, under promissory notes held by him in addition to his mortgage Securities. On Roynolds taking possession he appointed the defendant Far. qnhar(theretofore secretary of the com ny) the manager of the navigation and property on behal of the second mortgagees, for whom the defend ant Cooke (beretofore clerk of the company) acted as the solicitor. 'otice of the posses sion thus taken, and of the appointment of Farquhar as manager, was given at once to all the second mortggees, except the plaintiff by means of a circalar dated the 9th of August, 1845; and they, or the greater number of them, havng concurred in the course taken by Reolds, notice was also given to the plaintiff on the 18th of the same month, accompanied by a copy of the circular. The management thus reposed in Farqnhar was continued down
to the year 1853, when a recelver of the tolls, &c., of the canal was appointed by this Court, at the instance of the plaintiff, then suing on behalf of himself and all other the second mortgagees, except Reynolds. That bill, as orginally framed, alleged among other things that the plaintiff had " tacitly acquiesced in the proceedings of Reynolds ," but upon a subsequent amendment of the bil this pa'ssge was struck out, and tho plaintiff now sued for himlf o the other mortgagees of the same class being all made defendants. By the suit, as amended, the plintiff sought to fi specific charges of misconduct upon the defendants Far qnhar and Cooke, who, in addition to the relation in which they stood to the Bridgewater Canal Company, were also partners and the sole proprietors in an undertaldng caUed
'the Bridgewater and Chard Coal Company " the defendant Farquhar, moreover, being the manager of another company, known as "theChard Canal Company.7 Theso charges arose out of cortain alleged acts of the defendants in question, whereby a diminution in the rates and tolls charged for the carriago of coal and culm on the Bridgewater and Taunton Canal was, as alleged by the plaintiff, so arranged that the coal company, or in other words the defendants Farquhar and Cooke, had been the only gainers by it, at the expense of the Bridgewater and Taunton Canal Company, and consequently the mortgagees and the plaintiff rurt ersought to charge those of the class of secondmortgagees who had concurred in thepossession thus taken byReynolds with what had been actualy received by them or on their behalf by Farquhar, and also in the nature of wilf al default with the losses which had been incurred by the alleged improper conduct of the defendants Farquhar and Cooke, whom the plaintiffs treated as their agents; and the plain. tiffs also asked for the appointment of a manager.
Mr. Rolt and Mr. Osborne were for the plaintiffs; Mr. W. ML James, Mr. Cairns, and Mr. BageaUy for the defendants Earquhar and Cookce; Mr. Willcock, Mr. Chandless, Mr. Daniel, Mr. EaU M,Ir. Piggott, Mr. Bir, Mr. Beales, Mlr. Batten, MIr. Ampfalett, hfr. JoUliffe, Mr. Martindale, MrT. Osler, XT. Charles Hall, Xr. Welford, Mr. C. Ki RonpeUl, Mr. S. Thompson, and Mr. T. Hughes for the other defendants.
His Hosoui, after adverting to the several Acts of Parlament under which the company was constituted, said that the questions were, what were the rights of the plaintiff as between himself and the company and as betweenhimself and hisco-mortga,ees. The companyvas empoweredtoraiso moneys and to make securities under their common seal in a certain form authorized by the Act, which amounted to a simple assignment of the rates, tolls, &c., not containing any covenant to pay, and under which all persons were to be equaUy entitled without preference or priority; and the Act further directed that the interest of the money borrowed by mortgage should be paid half-yearly in preference to any dividend among the proprietors. With respect to a prior charge which amoonted to 10,0001., and which was now vested in the Exchequer Loan Commissioners, the Court had nothing to do In this suit. The rule was perfectly well settled as to the right of a mortgagee not choosing to take possessdon of the mortgaged property m respect of past rent and profits ; but the position of the parties iR this case was not liko the usual case of a mortgagor and mortggee. It would seem comtotent for any mortgagee of these tolls, without putting himself into possession of the propert, if he found that the company were about to pay a dividend contraryto the direction before mentioned, or if he found that his co-mortgagews were being paid more than they were entltled to, to file a bill in this court to restrain such payment or attempted proference. But, supposing some of the mortgagees to put themselves into possession, what would their position be with respect to the company? If the company were content, they would be in the position of anyother mortgagor, and would be able to fix wilful default (if any) against such mortgagees, and to have the aCCounts in the usual way. Then, however, came the further question, what would be the position of the several parties if, as in this case, one set of mor agees went into possession and not the whole body? Co nd any ortgagee go into possession otherwise than on behalf of himself and the other mortgagees, assuming them to concur? Looking to the case which had been cited from the " Term Reports," arising under a private Tmrnpike Act, and which had a very important bearing on this part of the case (his Honoar observed), he did not think he coald. Then remained this question. All who take pos on would be liable to wilful default as between themaulve. and the company, and therefore it could not be compulsory on every mortgagee to put himself in this position; or, in other words, It cold not be that one going into possession could compel others to do so too. It was competent for any one to dissent. What would be the right of the one who did dissent? He would be entitled, as between himself and the company, to look upon those who were in receipt of the tolls as the agents for the company, and not as agents for him, and he would have a right to see that none of them received more than they were entitled to. Having thas stated the several ri hts in a general way,whatwastheposition of Mr. Fripp. He was a mortgage creditor for 10,0001., and also held promissory notes of the company tothe amount of 2,0001. or 3,0001. more.
egal proceedings by action against the company were taken gy. him in respect of these notes, and he was about to obtain judgment, wvhen the company took a stop of which he complained, but which certainly seemed most reasonable and proper. They took the course of saying, " If you intend to proceed to jud ment u on your action we shall confess judgment as to all simple contract debts." This was accordingly done, and subsequently an arrangement was come to by the company that the mortgagees should also be protected by aUowving them to take possession. It was quite clear that the company had sequiesced in possession being taken on behalf of every mortgagee. Nothing turned upon Reynolds being what the plaintiff had termed a manufactured mortgagee. Reynolds went to the office at Brid,;ewater, and took what appeared to be an unnecessanly formal possession, and after doing so signed the papers appointing Farqnhar and Cooke. Reynolds professed to take possession on behalf of al the mortgagees, and not with the view of giving himself preference. The circular was sent but not to the p laintHffin the first instance. Theplaintiffhaa characterized this as anuanfair proceeding, but in truth itwas not so. HEl was aboatto be active and alertintaking proceedingswhichwould have put him in a positionof preference over the other creditors, and the not sendingthecircular was with the most proper intent-namely, that the rateable and equable application of the property among all the creditors might not be prevented. The plaintiff, having heard of this circlabr, had writton to Reynolds giving him notice that he should hold him responsible, disavowing the right of F rquhar to act on his behalf, and threatening to apply TO the Court of Chancery for a receiver. It had been argued for the plaintiff that the correspondence which had been read ought not to be taken too strongly against him, as containing a disavowal of the possession taken by Reynolds having been taken on behal of al, from the circumstance of some of the letters having crossed. But, independently of these letters, it was abundantly clear from others and from the conduct of the plaintiff (to whom accounts had been continually rendered by the mortgagees in possession) that he did disavow the acts done by Reynolds. Moreover, he was told in 1848 that Farqubar was acting on behalf of 19 persons; and jet he took no proceedinos till 1853 He was therefore simply a mortgagee entitded to file a bill against the company if they had paid any of the mortgagees without giving him an equivalent sum, and also to have an account against the mortgagees of what they had received ; but he was not entitled to any further account againstthecompany or against the mortgagees as to wilful default. He could not say that the morkagees were acting as trustees for him. His only right could be to see that they did not receive more than they were entitled to. In his original bill he had stated the possession to have been taken with his assent. He had afterwards been led to take a differont view, and to treat the mortgagees as being in an antagonistic position. go had isolated himself from them, and he was clearly only entitled to an account of what they
wreceived. That being so, the cuae which had been mnade by the plaintiff against the aefendants Farqahar and Cooke was also wholly disposed of, but, as specific charges had been brought against them, it was necessary to make some observations as to their conduct and position. Three points had been made against Mr. Farqnuhar; one
vas as to the vessels thst were emnployed, As to thes his Honour said ho thought that this gentleman had done nothing but what was perfetly open, fair, and above board
in every way. He appeared to have been a most active and useful agent; he had suggested valuable improvements in the machinery for unloading vessels, and he had diminished the expenditure on lhbour, especally in refernce to the drink of the men employed in the vessels. Another charge had been that Mlessrs. Farquhar and Cooke, being intere,ted in tho coal company, bad obtained for themselves advantages from their position, under the description of compensation for distant traffic. It was far from clear that what they had done in this rospeob
wasl anywayille l; and this view was bornout b the recent decision of tae Court of Queen's Bench in "W 4t v. thoeFlectric Telegraph Compny.h An to Mr Cooke -he hW spent himuself in this ooneern 39 000L ;ndhoe Ld reoommended his friends to spend 70,0o00. or OOI. mnre in thi, which had, unfortunately, tuzned out to be xry long conern. As to this eompensation for distant trafi, and as to tading the wharfs, noting could have been more fairer more straightforward. There were certain whairfj belorging to tho company, which, from the want of captibl or some other reson, were not found to be payen. ir Cooke and Mr. Farquhar had established the coAl companJ, wishing others to ioin with them, and being desrous of having ruembers who would embark in the same enterpriso and carry on the coal company. IE all their arrangoments as to this matter ao imputation could possibly zest upon Yr. Cooko or Mr. FacrquhM. An regarded the Endiewater and Tauntoa Canal Compan it would bo absurd to suprD that 4r Farquharor Yr. Coolke could have intended, had it been'in their poer, to defrand other members b notmaentioning that which must have been known to ftor-fifths of the actual members of the governing body of the Chard corporation. An to the allegation of intentional concealment or fraud it was quite idle. Then, &as to the contract for the 12,000 tons (his oiour here referred to a charge made by the plaintiff that tho company at the instance of Farquhar and Cooko had come to a resoluton, thatas to any traders who did ot carry 12,000 tonsof coal, &c., alone the canal per annnm the tolls should be oonsiderably zaised b as to any who did carry 12,000 tons the old tolls shouid be charged; that simultafneounslywith theo resolution, Farouhar, who with Cooke fomdteCard Coal Compan,hdcz'rce to carry 2,000tons- that this contract was not made known to the pablic; and that thereby considerableloss hadaccrnpd tothe mcome arising from the trafic, and thereby to the mortpgees). Itmight be tre that as to one portion of the publietnis contraethad beenconductodwithconsiderable concealment. It would have been better that it should have bon stated openly,plainly, andelearly, insteadof in the covert way it had been; and it was impossible not to regret the way ir
which this had been managed. As to tho first two charges against those gentlemen everything had been done that was proper. As to the last the Court was justified in giving to their intentions the best possible construction. Still, how. ever good the intentions might be, it was not safe for parties to trust even to their own honest in'ntioS as against a position in whichtheyhad placedthemselves, an1 withwhich their interests and those of their employers did not coincide. Having come to the conclusion that the plaintiff, Mr. Fripp, had nothing to do with Mr. Farquhar as his agent, only one point remained to bo disposed of-namely, the right of Mr. rnpp to attack the agent of another as well as the party himsile for whom he had constituted himself agent. He came to the oonclusion that there was no remedy to be had in this suit as aganst M1r. Cooke or Mir. Far-9uar as between them an the plaintiff. The bill beng dismissed there was nothing to in uce the Court to say it ought not to bo dismissed as againstthem with costs. As to the discovery sought nothing could have been gained to the 'lainnu by having them here. As regarded them personafy, he xaw no reason for making them pay the costs of the suit. Then, as to their being agents, If he was correct in holaing that the only right was against the mortgaces, the only ground that could be relied on would be that of fraud. but here there was nothing of fraud. There miEht have been some carelessness and some fault in not adoptng better proceedings, but there was no fraud or collusion. Here, too tho plantiff had lain by from 1847. The result must be tnat he must dismiss the bill as against Farquhar and Cooke with costs, and so much of it must be dismissed with costs as against the defendants described in the bill as mnortgagees and representatives of deceased mortgagees as sought an account against them of what would have been m e but for their wilful default. and as to other matters in the prayer (to which His Honour referred). As to the discretion of these parties in the management of the railway the Court could not, looking to the policy of the law, interfere with the company in their management of It. The order appointing a receiver must bo continued. The defendants, the mortgagees, or any of them, must be at liberty to apply at chambers for leave to use in the name of the company the powers vested in them by the aeveral statutes, so far as might be necessary for secouring the due collection and receipt of tho tolls and other income arising from the mortaged premises. His Honour after giving certain othe rspecil directions, also directed an account to be taken of what was due to the plaintiff and the defendants (the mortgagees) for principal and interest in respect of theirsecurities,regard being had t the moneys received by them out of the tolls or other income from the mortgaged premises, and other matters,tincludiug the costs, of so much of the hill as was not dismissed with costs were also disposed of, the details of which it is unnecessary to report

Chinese Emigration.
CHfINESE EZZIaRATION
TO THE EDITOR OF THB TIMES.
Sir,-In the very excellent letter on the social condition Of China acddressed by Sir John Bowring to the Registrar. General, which was published in 27w Times of the 12th inst., reference is made to the very large emigration of Chinamen to the West Indies and other parts. Sir John Bowring adds:-
*" Few Chinamen leave their country without a fixed perpose to return, to worship in the ancestral hall-to bring Sacrifices to the tomhs of their fathers; but it may be
oubted if one in ten revisits his native land. The loss of life from disease, from bad arrangements, from shipwreck, ind other casualties, amounts to a frightful percentage on thoee wvho emigrate."
t This testimony of Sir John Bowring to the lamentable condition of the Chinese emigrant cannot but recall to most readers' minds the disclosures made a few weeks ago at the Thames Police-court, in London, with respect to the eondition of the coolies on board the ship Duke of Portland, on her voyage from Hongkong to Havannah.
It will be remembered that on the occasion referred to the master of the vessel made the confession that 132 of the emigrants, all of whom had been taken on board, he said, in good health, had died between Hongkong and Havannah. He had " had as many as 200 invalids at one time," and " many more had died after they had landed in Cuba." His logbook contained daily, and more than daily, entries of death. The magistrate said he " had heard of the horrors of the naiddle passage when the odious slave trade was in existence, buthad never heard of anything like this.," The counsel said, "It is most horrible. Chinamen are brought from China to work on the plantations, and this is the result. The English flag is disgraced by such a traffic.'} The captain confessed, "It is a dreadful traffic, and quite time it was put an end to."
Yet this il-but an accidental disclosure of a system which has been going on for about ten years, and which was only casually brought to light in this instance by the magis. trate's inspection of the logbook, in a soit for wages.
* I have myself, when in Havannah, heard aceormts and witnessed scenes connected with this traffio which are perfectly appalling. In some instances, the proportion of dead to living at the conclusion of the voyage has been as high as 200 of the one for every 300 of the other. In March, 1853, the Britisb ship Gertrude arrived at Havannah with a cargo of lS Chinamen, and in a note appended to the re. turn we read, " of the Gertrude's 152 died."
Such are the horrors of this serond slave trade during the passage. When he arrives at his destination, in the majority of instances, the coolie finds his misery has but commenced. I have seen examples of considerate treatment and consequently of comparative comfort; but these are unhappily rare. On arriving at Havannab, after passing the quarantine, the coolie, if he survive, is transferred to the highest bidder, who places him upon his plantation side by side with his slaves. His term of service is eight years; his labour as hard as his master considers he can sustain. He receives a small payment monthly, which makes his condition by a few dollars preferable to that of the slave. He is exposed to the same toil, watched by the same overseer, with whip in hand and sword at the side, as the slave. On the other hand, his position is worse than that of his slave companion, inasmuch as his master's interest in him terminates after eight years. In proportion as the term of service approaches its expiration the motive for retaining the coolie in life decreases. The slave's life is usually worked out, as Cuban planters have themselves confessed to me, in ten years of full work. The Chinese coolie, as every one who has lived on the Cuban plantations knows, reaches his end on an average after a very much shorter term of labour. Again, the Chinaman does not bear the tropical heat with the ease with which the negro endures it. Many also have been unacocstomed in their own country to hard manual labour; some that I have met have in former life filled professional or other respectable positions in society, and many prove themselves able to undertake the management of the steam. engines in the sugar refinery or to fulfil duties in the machine shop. Add to the other sources of evil, the Chinese labourers are without exception males, and are com. poled to live apart both from the white inhabitants and from the negro population; suffering and vice are, as a consequence, tenfold increased among them.
What is the result ? On some plantations there is almost daily death-often by the coolie's own hand. The prevalonce of suicide is extraordinary, and can only be adequately accomated for by the hopeless misery in which they find tbemselves, and by the fact of their faling into a morbid state of body and mind, induced by il-treatment, overwork, and forced solitude, which leads them at times to make the most trifling added sorrow the occasion of their having recourse to self-destruction.
Permit me to adduce a single instance from my own observation, and I close this letter.
During a stay at one of the sugar plantations in the Island of Cuba I was one morning riding, as customary, at sunrise, with my Spanish entertainer, Don F. D-, wvhose own plantation was a fine specimen of the excelence to which a good *ystem aud considerate treatement, both of slaves And coolies, will bring an estate. Our object was to visit another plantation in the same district. After riding for an hour or two we were just emerging from a wood and entering the estate we purposed visiting; suddenly my companion stopped; I reined up equa71y abruptly. Before our horses' feet, crouching along the woodside, was a poor Chinaman, his only covering a small blue rag across his shoulder, his body scarcely more than a skeleton through hunger and suffering, his hair dishevelled, his eye wandering, his face and whole person a revolting spectacle. The poor man passed his roling eye upon us as my Spanish friend asked him why he did not return to the plantation. The coolle shook his head, muttered some words of Chinese, and showed plainly that the intellect was wandering as surely as the body was wiasting. A signal made in the direction of the plantation only brought from him indications that they had beaten and starved him. Again he slowly shook his head and, half doubled in form, crept forward towards the wood.
We rode in silence towards the i£sgenio. Arrived at the sugar-house, my companion ascertained from a slave vho held our horses that the coolie belonged to the estate we were visiting. Then, under the care of the administrador, we were shown through the various departments of the establishment, where, although my polite friend only praised, everything gave proof of mismanagement, and scarcely a single slave or coolie waswithout some mark indicative of il-usage. Leaving the place Don F- addressed the adtministrador with many words of courtesy, and asked if he had not missed one of his coolies. He believed there was ope straying was the cold reply. The Don could inform him of his whereabouts; it would be a good thing to send after him. Thec administrador hoped he would not trouble himself; it was of no importance. The Don repeated, pressed; the man might otherwise fall sick and occasion ex. pence. A shrug of the shoulders, a " Quimn sabe tP and a "Never mind," were all the answers he could obtain.
In the evening of the day, sitting beneath the verandah my host asked me what I thought of the sad sight we haa seen in the morning. For himself, he said, he had thought of nothing else but that spectacle of horror the whole day. To have brought theo coolie back and treated him until he was restored in mind and body would have cost money; it was cheaper to let him die. This was the secret of the administrador'shard heart. "And now," said he, "that poor man-that wasted form-has wandered through the wood a maniac, beneath this day's hot sun ; before this hour he is dead."
I give this narrative without note or comment. All I know, and that from theo confessions of slaveholders them selves, is that this mournful example does not stand alone, ahd that the island is full of like cruelty.
Such scenes make one exceedingly anxious to know who. ther our own possessions in the West Indies are perfectly free from the same stain. We all know that Chinese coolies ar{e largely imported into Domermaa and other British possessions, and it was believed by many that the encourage ment of this source of labour would prove a relief to the system of slavery. It would be very desirable to feel assured that the frightful crimes of Cuba and the sufferings on board of British ships are not in any measure reproduced on British soil.
Many of the coolies have told me that they were cajoled away from China under the impression that they were to be taken to a country where gold came down in rivers, and where they could pick up the yellow ore in handsful; and that after maling their fortune they were to be brought bick to their native home. How false their anticipations of fortune are it is needless to say; and bow rare the realization of their wished-for return is evident to Sir Jahn Bowring at the one end, and is still better known by those who have witnessed the sad reality of their condition
a the other.

John Collins, an old man, very d&3f, was indicted for having stolen a coal cellar grating, the property of Reece Thomas, and he was also charged with aving been pre. viously convicted of felony. He pleaded "Guilty."
The ASSISTANT-JUDGE sentenced the prisoner to be kept in penal servitude forfour years, and in doing so remarked that in January, 1856, it had been his duty to sentence him to one year's bard labour for an offence precisely like that to which he had now pleaded guilty-stealing coal cellar -plates from openings in street pavements, an offence of a very mischievous and dangerous character, and one of which he s1a becn repeatedly convicted, Under such circumstances it would be an idle mockery to sentence hina to a mere tern of imprisonment.
William Camflin, 21, was indicted for stealing a petticoat, value 9s. 6d., the property of William Lakin. He pleaded
A return of several former convictions was put in against him. In 1853 he was sentenced to seven years' transportation for stealing three penny pies.
The AssisTA?ST-JU1JG sentenced him to four years' penal servitude.
Francis Rose, 21, was tried and Convicted of having feloniously broken and entered the premises of Anthony HIurd. and stolen two carpets and other articles, value 84s., his pro' perty. This prisoner had been previously convicted and was a ticket-of-leave man.
The COUP.T sentenced him to six years' penal servitude.
Jane Davis, 22, was indicted for stealing a bracelet and other articles and 71. 5s. 6d., the property and money of Catherine Duppa, her mistress.
She pleaded " Guilty."
The prosecutrix resides at 19, Nottingham-place, Man. chester-square, and some months ago the prisoner, who had been her servant, absconded, having stolen plate and money to the amount of about 601. The prisoner gave herself up at Lambeth police court on the 12th of February, and it was then ascertained where she hadpawned the plate. The prosecutrix gave 61. to recover a teapot which had been pledged. The other articles were produced.
The ASSMSTANT-JUIDGE said, she need not have paid the 61., as the Court would have compeUed the restitution of the teapot. He should consider what sentence to pass upon the prisoner.
Alexander MDougal was indicted for having obtained from Elizabeth Underwood the sum of 2s. upon the false pretence that a certain ticket which he handed to her was an order for admission to the Princess's Theatre. %
The prisoner pleaded "-Guilty."
FIr. F. M LELwIS said, he was instructed'on behalf of the prosecution, which was instituted by Mr. Charles Kean on public grounds, though he had not suffered any loss through the act of the prisoner; but if the pretended orders which the prisoner disposed of had been admitted of course a corresponding loss would have been the consequence. As it was, the persons whom the prisoner had victimized with these sham orders had been sufferers, in losing their money, and in the trouble and annoyance they were put to in presenting them at the theatre, and the delinquent having been caught Mr. Kean thought it a case which ought to be prosecuted.
An officer of Coldbath-fields Prison stated that the prisoner had been convicted of felony some time ago, and sentenced to eicht months' hard labour.
The AssisTAIT-JvnDG deferred the sentence.

THE CROwN COURT.- (Before Mr. Jt(sticeCROMiSToX.)
COXSPERACY TO UTTER A FORGED WILL.
John Oldershaw, Joseph Sills, sen., Joseph Sils, jun., William Wragg, Mary Wragg, and Sarah Radbourne were indicted for conspiring together to utter a forged wil of one John Jackson, deceased. They were further charged for conspiring together by perjury to have the said forged will admitted to probate in the Prerogative Court of the Archbishop of York. All the prisoners pleaded "Not Guilty," but the two Sills pleaded " Guilty" to perjury.
The case excited considerable interest from the large amount of property concerned, the deceased John Jackson having died worth from 60,0001. to 70,0001.
Mr. Price, Mr. Middleton, and Mr. Shepherd prosecuted; and Mr. Temple, Q.C., Mr. Blanchard, and Mr. Dearaley defended all the prisoners except the two Sills, who were undefended.
Mr. PRICE, in opening the case, after stating the law relating to conspiracies, said that the deceased Mr. John Jackson died in 1854. He lived at Stapleford, in the county of Notts, and was lord of the manor, and resided at the Manor-house, and was also patron of the living. He was possessed of very considerable landed and personal property, was a bachelor, and had resided by himself forthe last two or three years. The only inmate of his house was Sarah Padbourne, the prisoner, who was his housekeeper and servant of all-work. He had no relative but a person named Searson. He Was very eccentric in Lis habits, and for his station in life was an illiterate man. Re was upwards of 70 when he died, and his relative Mr. Searson was present at his funeral. No will was then hinted at or prodnced. Subsequently the wil which was the subject of the
resent Inquiry was brought forward, and was a most unooubted forgery. This will had been produced by the defendants Radbourne and Oldershaw, who were employed by the deceased, and it purported to give aUl his real and per. sonal estate and effects ot whatsoever kind of whichhe was possessed at the time of his death to his trustee, Sarah Radboumne, and to her and her heirs for ever. It gave 201. a- year to the curacy of Stapleford, and appointed Miss Sarah Radbourne sole executrix. The wil bore date the 24th of November, I853, and -was attested by the two defendants Sllls, and purported to be signed by the deceased John Jack. son. Beneath the signature it appointed John Oldershaw his trustee. This will would be proved to be a forgery. Shortly before his death the testator said he had not made a will, and would not make one. John Oldershaw, who was said to be resent when the wiU was made, knew that the testator hab said this a week before his death. The evidence would show that the will had been made by John Oldershaw long after it bore date, and that SarahRadbourne and the two Wraggs knew of what had taken place. The two Wraggs had gone to a shoemaker named Darker, who acted as village lawyer, and asked him to forge Mr. Jaclkson's signature, and had ehown him several signatures to imitate, and had offered him 5,0001. to do this, and 1,0001. to his wife to persuade him to do it. Mrs. Wragg, who did th:s, was the sister of Miss Radbourne, who got the whole of this large property under the wiUl. After the funeral Sarah Radbonrne took possession of everything, and assumed the proprietorship. The next of kin, Mr. Searson, then set up his rights, and Sarah Radbourne put in X proxy in the Prerogative Court, and propounded the wilL. It then became necessary that the attesting witnesses should be caUed in the ecclesiastical court. They never attended, and were committed for contempt. Afterwards they attended, and attempted by perjury to establish the wil
Afterwards, in gaol, the two Sills had made statements that the wil was wrong, and they had stuck to the story because of Oldershaw threatening them; buttheyfeared they should get transported.
After this outline of the case, the learned counsel caled the following witnesses:-
Mr. William llrtdson, the registrar of the Prerogative Court, produced the will of the late John Jackson, the citation of and proxy of Sarah Radbourne, the condidit allegation of Sarah Radbourne, and depositions put in by the two Sills, Oldershaw, and Wragg, and all the documents.
Examined.-The two Sils were committed for contempt on the application of Miss Radbounre.
[The wi was then put in and read, dated the 24th of November, 1853, purporting to be the last will and testament of John Jackson, of Stapleford, in the county of Notts, bequeathing all his real and personal pronertv, and all his effects of every kind, to his trustee, Miss arah Radhourneand further, "I, John Jackson, does wil 201 a-year to be
ven to the perpetual curacy of Stapleford," and leaving 9 ohnl$dershaw trustee, and attested by the two prisoners the Sils.
Oldershaw's deposition was put in, stating him to have been a tenant of deceased for about 20 years, and that he lived in the same village. Sarah :Radbourne was his house. keeper for five years. Deceased was a bachelor, and upwards of 70 years of age. On one occasion he was cleanin the windows when the deceased called him in and Lsked him to write out a will for him, which he agreed to do as well as he could. The deceased dictated it to him in a sitting-room in his house. He then copied what he had written as it appears in the wilL He wrote the attestation clause as it appears at the deceased's dictation. He then asked him to go for the two Sills. He went for them, and Mr. Jackson asked them when they arrived to sign his will, and they said they were agreeable. They then attested the will. The Sils attested the will in the presence of the testator. The contents of the wil were not mentioned to them. The deceased then
ut a wax seal to the wi as it now appears, and said, "I eliver this as3my act and will." After this he said, " You have forgotten to put yourself inastrustee, John;yoecanpxt it here." Deponent said "Very wel," and wrote his name as trustee at the bottom of the will. He got no remunera. tion for making it, and never wrote a wil before in his life. The deceased talked rationally, and was fully capable of making his last wilL The will was the one he had drawn.
The deposition of the elder Sills confirmed this statement of his havmg attested the will as described. His son was with him, and also attested it. He was committed to Not. tingham Gaol eight weeks for not giving evidence in this cause in the ecclesiastical court.
The deposition of the younger Sils, grocer and beerseler, of Stapleford, was read, corroboratig the statement of Oldershaw. He was asIo committed for contempt, for not proving the attestation. He never said the wil was not a right one. He had never said the will was a forgery. It was not arranged that he should marry Sarah Radbourne after deceased's death.
James Sollary, solicitor, of Nottingham, examined.-He acted as MIr. Jackson's solicitor before his death, and had seen him write. The signature to the originalwil produced was not the testator's, He knew the prisoner Oldershaw. He met him some short time before Mr. Jackson's death in a railway carriage, He said he had been to fetch Mr. Spencer, a surgeon, to Mr. Jackson. They were talkn
aout Mr. Jackson and his peculiarities, and witness asked Oldershaw who he thought his property would come to. Oldershaw said he did not know, and be was quite sure he would not make a will.
Cross-examined.-He had seen him write more than six times. He had known him ten years.
James M'Queen, draper, of Nottingham, examined.-He had frequentl done business with the deceased, and was acquainted with his handwriting. The signature to the wiU was not the deceased's. It was dissimilar in many respects. He had a conversation with the two Sills while in gaol on one occasion, and said to Joseph Sills, he thought they had been very badly used in being sent to gaol, and he should advise them to speak the truth. The younger Sills said,"But what vould they do to use' Witness said that would aU depend upon circumstances. If they had signed the will through ignorance they might be leniently dealt witb Last Monday he had seen young Sills in Stapleford, and had a conversation with him. He asked Sills howhe was? He said he was very bad; "If transportation is worse than this life I have been leading it is bad," He said if he had only taken the advice I gave him when in prison he would have known what his fate was long since. -e said that he had been completely deceived byOlderahaw respecting this will. that Oldershaw came up one night to their house between 10 and 11 o'clock, and orought a paper with him, and said that the old master had sent a paper up to him for him and his father to sign. They signed it as well as they could. At the time they didnot know it wasa will; Oldershaw did not tell them it was. They signed it in their own house, and were never near Jackson's. He said he had seen Sarah Rad'ourne many times afterwards, and told her she must gve up the property, and almost went on his knees to beg her to doit; but she would not; and he thensaidtoher he would expose the whole afir. Her reply was, he durst not after the oaths he had taken. He said he had told Older'ehaw the same, and had got the same reply.
Cross-examined.-He had done business with him onoe or twice, and had seen him write twice only. He noticed that heoined all the letters of his signature together except the
andthe " o" in John.
Mr. John Fletcher, examined, said he had been acquainted with the deceased 40 years, and knew his handwriting. The signature to the wiU produced he should not think was his handwriting. He saw deceased on the Monday, and he died on the hursday. He was then very ill1
His hands shook. He saw Oldershaw as he was coming away, and said to him he found MIr. Jackson very ill, and
hewould not live manydays, andthat he had not settled his affairs, and he (witness) had told the housekeeper, Mlts Radbourne, so; and if it was not done soon he *would not be _capable. Oldershaw said Mr. Jackson was a vr
curious man and very stupid, and he did notl kow what could be done with himn. Hebad aconversationwith Jackson, the deceased, when he saw him about his making a will. He saw Sarah Radhourne after this and spoke to her about his will, and told her the deceased iad not settled his affairs, in the presence of the prisoner Mary Wragg. Saah Radbourne safd she had lived with M1r. Jackson 13 yer
and had plenty of Clothes when she went to live with him - she had never received a farthing of wages, and then ha
scarcely any clothes to put on, and if Mr. Jackson did not leave her anytig she hd worked, and could work again. He was present at the funeral, and no will was produced. One day afteor the sae of Mrx. Jackson's effects he had a con. -versation with William Wrg and he said in rough terms, "He would split on them." He had mentioned to names. He sid he wanted a deal of money, and had not got it.
Cross-examined.-He had made a deposition in the ecclesiastical court, and shouldthinkhementionedthenthatOlders aw said he would s,lit upon them. (This statement did not appear on the deposition.) He had not seen him write
fuently, He never heard that Miss Radbourne was a relative ofMr.-Jackson. Her father and mother wereon veryintimate terms with -Mr. Jackson.
E-examined.-He thought the signature was something like Mr. Jacksn's handwriting. He was not sufficiently acquainted with his handwrting to speak positively
4oit.
William Wallace, a lace warehouseman at Nottingham, examidned.-Had seen M1r. Jacksoni write, but not very fine.
ent The s ature to the will did not look exactly
he ha seen him write. The "J" in Jackson lvasnot like. He was not sufficiently acuqted with his handwriting to speak positively, but he beh'eved the signature was not Mr. Jackson's. He saw Sarah- Radbourne in 3'uy last, and had a conversation with her, He told her an
attorney in Derby had written to his father, and bad applied to hin for his evidence in this case, and that his father had gone down to the Manor-house and told the present tenant. She was very vexed, and asked witness what he thought about it? She told witness to tell his father not to tell about it. She said, " Tel1 him if he'll etick to me I'll stick to hbi, and he shall be all right." About September or October twelvemonth he had a conversation with the younger Sills about this, and Sills said, if he went to York before be got paid e should not get it afterwards. He said Oldershaw a,peaxed a rogue, he had feathered his nest rarely, and those = had done the most had got the least; he could not believe they would have been such liars, Witness asked him whom he meant, and he said, " AUl of them." There was a conversation shortly before this about distraining some of the tenants for rent, and one said to the younger Sills, "Joe, they will bo coming to thee next." Sill
answered " They ba better not; I can tell thorn a thing or two." He saw the younger Sills in gaol in April last, and he seemned much cut up, and asked witness about the case and witness told him to speak the truth, and he said he was obliged to speak what he had said before. Heoregretted he was obliged to do Miss Radhourne good, but he was obliged to say what he had ad before, or he would be - if he would.
hr. John Milward examined.-Is stock taker to the Butterley Company, at Laybrook, in Derbyshire. He knew the late Mr. John Jackson for 40 or 50 years, and had had conversations with him about his affairs. He always objected to making a will, and said so at different times. He saw him three weeks and three days before he died. His hands were very shaky. He saw Sarah Radbourne before he went into the house. She had asked witness before that time to ask Mr. Jackson to make a will. He asked Jackson, tad he objected, and he told her he objected. He attended the funeral of the deceased, and no wil was produced or - read.
Cross-examined.-He knew Mdr. Searsoni, the prosecutor. He lived 12 mifles from the deceased. Io -very seldom saw Searson at his house. He never saw any relation of Jackson at his house. Miss Radboasne was no relation of the deceased. He knew Miss Etadbourne's father and motherthey had beoome reduced in circumstances, and deceased had been at the expense of the funeral of MIiss iadbourne's mother. Relations sprung up at his funeraL
M1r. Coope, solicitor, of Loughborough, in Leicestershiro, had many times seen the deceased write ; the last time was in 1847. Tho signature to the will was not, in his opinion in the handwriting of John Jackson. Hle knew the two Sills The elder Sillswas formerly his tenant. On Tuesday, the 4th of December, 1855, he called at their house and saw the father. He remarked to him that they had lost Mr. Jackson, and that he had seen something in the naper about his will. Sills asked him what he had heard about it, and he said, " That that bricklayer (Oldershaw) had forged the will, and that he and his son had attested it after Mr. JackEon's death." Sills said, " Ah I but who is to pro7e it ? There was nobody by."
Cross-exaamined.-When he saw the deceased sign his name in 1847 It was to a parchment deed. To the best of his belief a signature shown to him was not in deceased's handwriting. (The signature shown was part of the exhibit in the ecCesistical court.)
Edward Jones. of Stapleford, examined.-Is a joiner, and was acquainted with the late MIr. Jackson for about 40 years, and had purchased bricks from him. He had frequently seen himn wrte. He could not swear whether the signature to the will was in his handwriting or not. It had a similhrity to it.
MIr. John Dale, examined.-Had seen deceased write. In his judgment the signature to the will was in the deceased's handwrting. After looking at the signature again, he said he thought it was not; a third look made him think it was.
Joseph Nethercliffe, examined.-Is a lithographist and facimilist to the British Museum, and engagec in detecting forgeries for the Bank of England. To the best ofi his judgmnent he had adifficulty in sayingthatthe signature to thewill was a disguised hand. It bore marks about it of a slow and hesitating hand. The pen had been frequently taken off and not currently written. He could have no judgment on it without comnarison of it with otber signatures. It was not a shaky handlike a paralytic's; it was a slow and hesitating han0, hkea imitation.
Wi Shaw, polce-constable of Stapleford, remembered the late Mr. Jackson and the time of his death. He saw Oldershaw three days before his death. A person with witness asked if Mr. Jackson was worse and likely to die. Oldershaw saidhe was. The person with witness asked if it was true that he had not made a wilL He saidd' No, he had not; and it was no use asldng him." He knew the younger Sills, and had a conversation with him a few days cetore he went to gaol. He said Mr. Jackson's will was not a right one; that he should not go to York, and no person should make him. He had within the last few weeks seen the younger Sills, who said to witness that he would not be wanted as a witness; he should tell the truth; that he did not know what he was doing when he signed the will as a witness and they were all a pack of rogues together. He said, " You recollect me telling you that Mr. Jackson's will was not a right one."
Mr. Beck, plumber and glazier, examined.-Had.been acquainted with Oldershaw for some time. A fewvdays before Mr. Jackson's death Oldershaw came to his house audhe had some conversation with him about Jackson's will, and asked him if he had made one. Oldershawsaid he had not, and he did not think- he would make one; it was as much as their places were worth to ask him to make one.
Mr. Thorneley, examined.-Had a conversation with Oldershaw a few days before Jackson died, and Oldershaw said he vwas not likely to get better. Witness asked him who was lkely to get his property. He said he did not know. Witness said, "That is allnonsense has henot made awilll" andhe said "No; he is a very stupid man, and we dare not askwbino" He shortly after Mr. Jacksont
death saw the prisoner Wragg at Woon rn selling a horse that had belongedato Mr. Jackson. Ahterdthe sale they had some ale and brandy, and he hWragg) sprent nearly 21,

Mary Barker, exmnd-a the widow of the late dlijah Barker. She had knowrn Ms. Wragg and her husband many years. She remembered Wragg coming over to her husband's house in 1853, and heard Wragg have a conversation with her husband for him to make a wilL. He asked her husband to make {t as if it had been ir. Jackson'z. Her husband wrote out a document for him, and he took it away. He came a Little time after. It wras made dfferent several times. Wragg and his wife asked him to make a fresh will; he said oiss wadtourne wanted the alteration to be made, as he (Jacko) would not make one. She afterwards remembere Mary Wragg and her husband coming. They brought a leaf, as if out of a bcook, for him to imitate Mr. Jackson's handwriting. They were to sig the will. Her husand refused. William Wragg said John Olderahaw had made one, and they should bring that forward vif her husband would not sign. Both William aWrge and Msrs. Wragg said Mss eadbourne would give them a,000i to do it. Msi. Wragg said eo witness that her sister (niss Eadboerne) ould not miW i giving her husband another 1,000. if she would persuade her husband to sign the will
llentioned.-Iher husband ws a shoemaker by trade. She disnotinow her husbandto make wills, or to be engaged in givng adice on legal matters. She had not been mar. riedato himaso long-only fourlyears.

Badbourne and the Wraggs. Was bail for Wragg, nud conversed with him as to Jakson's wilL Elijah Barkers name was mentioned. Shortly before r. Jackson's death had
conversation with Wragg when he was ploughmng. Wragg asked him to witness a wnill for him. He said John Oldershaw had made it He told him if be could get no one else h (waitness) should have no objection. He asked if there would be any danger in doing it as he should not like to be brought into trouble. He dsaid "tIf I would hold my noise aO one would know anything about it." He said, Oldershaw had made a will before which left half to MUiss Badbourne and hal to himself (Oldershaw), and they didnot approve of it. He told me about the will he wanted meto witness, and said it left everything to MIiss Radhourne, except 20h a-year to the parson of the pariah, which bequest
nould throw a better light upon it. Wragg came again the night after Mr. Jackson died, and said that they had had a long talk about me about witnessing this wilL He said he had been to Derby and came home with Horrobin in his cart, who put him dowrn at the end of Sandacre-Hne, which he went up to avoid the gaas of the people, lest they should know that he bad been out so soon after his master's death. Hie sad, when he went off to Derby that moring be did not kinow hut that John Oldershaw was to come to witness the will. InsteAd of that they got the two Sills.

matula Ann Shaw, wife of the last witness, examined.- Had heardWragg saythatBarker,of Derby, had madeseveral wills for Miss abourne. The day after Mr. Jackson's death Wragg was at witness's house, and said that Miss Rad. bourne and Oldershaw wanted her husband and one of the Sills to witness the wilL He said all was left to Sarah Radbourne, and that the clergyman was to seek for this will, and that he would find it in a bureau; and that, as the will left 201 year to Mr. Almond, the clergyman, it would throw a better light on their cause. On the Taesday before Mr. Jackson's death Sarah Radbonrne sent for me to fetch the best of the things out of the house. She said that there was no will except what John Oldershaw bad made. Witness refused to fetch any of the things. Saw her several times after Mr. Jackson's death, and asked if be had made a wilL She would not say whether he had or not. Saw Mary Wragg on the Saturday after Mr. Jackson's death. She said ahe had been to lawyer Johnson's, who told her he did not think that the will was wothapenny. Afterwards saw the Sills. The elder one said that they bad done for Sarah Padbourne What would transport them if the right course of law was taken. Saw them in gaol. One of them asked what was best for themto do, and that be had sworn that he had seen Mr. Jackson sign a will, and that several persons had visited him in prison and said that, unless he stuck to what he had said, he would be transported. I asked him whether the wi wes signed in Jaceson's presence, but be did not satisfy me, saying that he wished to speak the truth, but dared not.
Oross-examined.-It was a day or two before Jackson's death that Wragg said that the clergyman would find the will in the bureau. On the Saturday after the death I heard tbat the will bad been found there.
John Horrobin.-I am a fruit dealer at Stapleford. Saw Wrg ign Derby market the day afterMr. Jackson died. He suddne was come to se-Mr.Barker. Afterwardsat the Angel Inn he told witness that they had a will. which was omure and that they were going to get Jerry Shaw and one of the Sills to witness it.

He al dwitnes to say that he had come o the 24thof No. einber to be paid for some apples, and had then seen Oldert shaw and the two S ills with r. Jackson.

She was crying, and said that che was afraid that the Sis would not be' stont," and that they would -all be Iraprtd together. Heard the Sills say that unless Mins

She said that the Sills had done that which would transport them, and that the had themi quite fast, and that if they said anything they would transport themelves as well. She several times told witness that she and Oldershanb
were going to be mnarried, and come down to that place altogether if he could get `shut" of his woman that he then lived with.

]LEWE5S. TmcxnAs~liot-
The commission for the county of Sussex was opened in this town on Monday, and to-day both Courts proceeded to busiess. Mr. Justice Cresswell sat in the Crown Side, and Mr. Baron Channell presided at Nisi Prius. The calendar contains the names of 40 prisoners, but none of the cases appear to be of an aggravated character. Six causes only are entered on the civil side, the whole of which are com. mnonjury cases.
Crvm SIDL-(Before Mr. Baron CH LT)
WEZDES V. Fi.
This was an action upon a bil of exchange for 300L1, drawn by the defendant, who is a cornet in the 3d Dragoons, and accepted by Mr. Joseph Paxton, also a cornet in the samne regiment, and which was endorsed to the plaintiff by a person named Curlewis. There were a number of pleas put upon the record by the defendant, but the only material one was a plea that the bill in question had been fraudulently obtaned by a person named John Charles Johns, and that no consideration had been given for it by the plaintiff.
Mr. ML Chambers, Q.C., and Mr. Honyman were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. E. James, Q.C., and Mr. Pollock were for the defendant.
It appeared that the bil which was the subject of the action was dated the 27th of September, 1l56, at three months' date, and it bore the endorsement of Johns, and also that of Curlewis; and the fact of the notioe of dis. honour was admitted, and these formal facts having been put in evidence the case for the plaintiff was closed.
Mr. JAMas addressed the jury on behalf of the defendant, and said, that the present case was one that wouldrequire their most careful consideration, because there could be no doubt that the defendant had been robbed of this bill under the pretence that it should be discounted for him, and, although there was always considerable difficulty in mainng out the real facts connected with these bill transactions, he hoped to be able to satisfy them that this was really the case in the present instance. The defendant, Mr. Fife, was an officer in the 3d Dragoons, and M1r. Paxton, who was the son of Sir Joseph Paxton, was a brother officer in the same regiment, and there was no doubt that the biU in question was drawn for their mutual accommodation to raise money, and it was intrasted to Johns, whose name appeared as the endorser of the bill, in order that he might discount it, which he undertook to do. Instead of that, however he kept the bill, and nothing was heard of it until the present action was brought against .r. Fife. He then proceeded to stato that Johns was a man who had been three times an insolvent, and who it appeared, having by tlis means become possessed of the ill, contrived, in some way or other, to poss it over to the present plaintiff, who sought to recover the amount of the bill from the defendant upon the suggestion that he had given value for it. He believed, however, that when the jury had heard the facts he should lay before them, they would be opinion that the plaintiff was avare of the nature of the transaction and that no real value had been given for the bill, and, if this should be made out to their satisfaction, the defendant would be entitled to A verdict.
Mr. George Paxton was then examined.-He deposed that ke was formerly aii officer in the 3d Dragoons, and in Setember last he was with the regiment at Brighton. The defendant, Mr. Fife, was an officer in the same regiment. Aboutthe 25th of September Johns, the person whose name appeared as one of the endorsers of tee bil inquestion caled uponhim at the barracks. He had never seen him before that time. They had some conversation about money, and Johns told hin that if he could get the namoe of another officer, with his own, to a bill he could get it discounted for him. He afterwards sav Johns at the shop of a cigar merchant at Brighton, and a bill for 300 was cashed by him. This was not the bill that ws the subject of the present action. Another bill for 600., which was drawn by Mr. Fife, and accepted by witness, was afterwards discounted through the agency of Johns, and 2001.waspaid in mone- for it and two racehorses. Witness bad tke horses, and Mr. Fife Wad the money. The 3004 bill that was now the subject of inquiry was given to Johns to get discounted, and he promined to pay the money into wit. ne-s's bankers in London a day or two afterwards, but he never did so, and he had never recoived a farthing on account of the bill; and the first information he heard relating ',o it was from his attorney, Who told lim that an action had been oommenced against Mr. Fife, as the drawer of the bill, to recover the amount. When he found that he could not obtain the money he applied to Johns to restore him the bill, and he told him it was destroyed, and he was satisfied with that answer.
ross-examined.-He had also had several money and racing transctions with Johns, and he won one bet of him uhpon the Great Northern Handicap. Johns did not find tEe money for the 6004 bill, but it was advanced by a cerson named IA Mert. T1he horses were the property of L Mert, and the wereitfll In witness's p on. The 6004 bill had been-llbd. Witness bad been sued upon one of his acceptances, but after he had pleaded to the action it was not proceeded with. He pleaded infancy. He was not lot of age, aud he was, of course, not of age while these biIt transctions were going on. He might have told the parties that he wa3 of age. Could not say exactly how long he had been in eXq habit of accepting bills of exchange for the acommodatiotof himselfandotherbrotheroffiocrs. They might have "backed" bills to the amount of 2,0001. or 3,0004 while he was in the srmy. The transaions between hita and Mr. Wife might hvaounted altogether to about 1,2004. or 1,M01 Mr. Fife " backed" bills for him to the amount of about 1,0001, and he in return " backed" ono for him to the amount of 2301. He had had tho same sort of operations with other officers.
Jn answer to further questions put by Mr. CHITNIDnRS the witness said, that he night have accepted bills to the
amount of 3,0001., knowing at the time that he was under Fe. He a1so stated that he had now left the rmy about three weeks, and tbat lhe had resigned his commission for
ivte roasons that had nothing whatever to do with those
transactions.!
In re-examination the witness said, that ho was now 20 years and six months old. It also appeared that Johns kept racehorses, and that they stood at the same stable as the witness's at llsley, and he said that he might have told him upon one oceasion that he was of ago. Be also sld that JA5Wert, the person he had mentioned, was a very curious customer, and he did not know exactly what he was. (A laugh.) The two horses he received as nart of the consideration for the 6001. bil were valued at 325o& to him, but he did not believe they would fetch more than 1001. or 10A. at the hammer if they were sold now.
Mr. Douglas Munroe Fife, the defendant, was then examined, an he confirmed the evidencegiven by Mr. Paxton as to no consideration having been given for the bilL
In answer to a question put by Mr. CHAMBiERS he said that when he put his name to the bill he of course intended topy at ome time or other.
Jr JA&is submitted that upon this evidence he had made out a sufficient prim4 facie case of fraud to call upon theplaintiff to show that he had given value for the bilL
Mr. Baron CHANBLL said it appeared to him that this ou lit to be done.
r. Frederick Weeden, the plaintiff, was accordingly ealled.-He stated that he carred on the business of a woollendraper in Warwick-street, Golden-squRre, and he had been m the habit of supplying Mr. Curlewis, one of the endorsers of the bill, who was a tailor, with goods, and at the end of 1866 he was indebted to him more than 7001 He asked hiu to givo him some mone on account in the beinning of January, aud he hand him the bill in question, which he placed to his aocount and gave himn credit for the amount. He said that he hsA taken other bills of Curlewis in the same way, and he had no knowledge of any of the circumstances under which the bill bad been originally obtained.
This witness was subjected to a very rigid eross-examination by Mr. EDNwi JemAs, and in the course of his answers ho said that the debt due by Curlewis was composed of an old balance from the year 1855 of 2001. andl 500. worth of goods that he had supplied to him during 1856. He produced his books to show that the bill had been regularly entered to Curlewis's credit, and he said that there was always a sort of standing balance against him, and the bills that were handed to him were intended to cover that balance. He also stated that when the bill was dishonoured he made no claim. upon Curiewis, but at once instructed his attorney to proceed against the defendant, and his attorney, it appeared, was also the attorney for Curlewis. The plain. tiff also stated that Curlewis had asked him to bring the present action.
In re-examination the plaintiff swore positively that ho took the bill in the ordinary course of his business, and that he gave Curlewis credit for the amount in the ordinary way.
Mr. ED\VIN JA.s,s in tho conrse of a very able summing up of the case for the defendant, urged that the endeavour to show that consideration had been given for the bill was a mere sham and fudge, and that the " standing balanco" that had bsen talked about by Mr. Weeden was gut n solely for the purpose of carrying out the fraud that h:
been practised upon these young men, and to make it appear that algenuine debt existed between Curlewis and the p=aintiff. all these cases of biUl robberies the jury were a*ar
that it was necessary to find out what was caLed an "innocent holder" for value to bring the action, and it certainly was an odd thing that a tailor generally appeared to be the unfortunate individuaL (A laugh.) He submitted that in the present case the evidence of the plaintiff was most unsatisfactory, and he observed that iit vwas truo that Curlewis owed the amount that had been stated to the pla. tiff, he might have been called to prove the fact; but they had not dared to put himn in the witness-box.
Mr. CaELiERs, in his reply, contended that the plaintiff had clearly establisbed that he had taken this bil in part payment of his debt, that he knevw nothing wthatever of any fraud having been committed, and that it would be a great hardship upon him if he could not recover under such circumstances. His learned friend had said agood deal upon the system which prevailed of plundering young men like the defendant and Mr. Paxton, but he rely could not help expressing his opinion that the disclosures that had been made in this and ether cases of a similar character, gave a very melancholy picture of the state of society of the present day. It had been said that these young men had been plundered; but when it appeared that one ofthem had been giving acceptances to a large amount, knowing that they were worthiess at the time he did so on account of his being under age, he could not help saying that it appeared to him they were the parties who desired to fleece others, and it was rather too much, having been "hail, tellow, well met" with the people who were concerned with them in these sort of transactions for a certain time when it answered their purpose that they should be allowed to turn round and say that they had been defrauded.
Mr. Baron CHANNELL, in summing up the case to the jury, explaiied to them the law upon the subject, and said that the only point for them to consider was whether the plaintiff ha mado out that he had given value for t)me bill and that he had received it in part payment of a genuine pre-existing debt. If this were proved to their satisfaction the plaintiffwas entitled to a verdict, notwithstanding the original circumstances under which the hill was obtained; but if they had any doubts upon the subject, or if they should be of opinion that the transction was merely an arrangement getup to enable the plaintiff to sue upon the bill, then he would notinlaw he entitled to recover, and the defendant ought to have a verdict.
The jury retired, and after being absent about an hour they returned into court and gave a verdict for the defen-

mIs was an action for an illegaland excessive distress.
Mr. Macauleaf Q.C., and 1Ifr. Brewer were counsel for the plaintiff; Mr. Serjeant Hayes and Mr. Field for the defendant.
The plaintiff i6 a lieonsed hawker and & bazaar keeper who travels about to fairs, at which he erects his booth and exhibits for sale every variety of fancy goods, such as papiermach6 teatrays, writing and dressing cases, as well as Jewelry. Among other places hg has for many years been in the habit o opening his bazaar at Mansfield fair, which takes place on the 10th of July and lasts two days. For that purpose he wvent to Mansfield last sunmer, in the month of June, and took a sho pthere for the purpose of duly preparing and polishing up his commo. dities for the approaching fair; and it appeared that on the Saturday before the fair-day the defendants, who had recently become the market-toU collectors, called upon the plaintf to ask him what he had been in the habit of paying at Nottingham for his standing in the market-placo there. He replied that he had paid there Id. per foot for the first 8 feet and 1jd. per foot for the remainder, and that he was willing to pay the same at Mansfield for the 50 feet of space which he required. On the Monday following he began erecting his. booth, and while the worl wasiprogress the defendants came to him and satd that they shonld have 30s. for the standing in the market-place, to which he replied that he, should not pay so much. The booth was erected, the fair wss held, and the plaintiff's bazaar remained open for several days. At lengthhepreparedtodept on his wat
to Worksop, packed up all his goods and loaded his van. Then the defendants came and demanded 30s. for the rent of the ground upon which his bazaar had stood; but theplaintiff refused to pay more than lls. lOd., offeriog the defendants five halfcrowns and asking for 8d. in change. At this time the plaintiff's van and goods had all been removed a short distance from the spot on which the bazaar had stood ; but the defendants notwithstanding issued a distress warrant, under which the plaintiff's van fuU of goods was taken and chained to theo monunment of Lord George Bentinck, in the market-place; though the plaintiff informed the defendants that he estimated the whole value of what was seized at 1,0001. The plaintiff gersisted in his refusal not to pay the 30s., and the van was etained abont a week, at the end of which time, he having been to Nottingham and seen his lawyer, paid the money, and received possession of his property.
There was some conflict of evidence as to the precise effect of the conversations between the plaintiff and defendants, but the substance of the transaction between them was as stated above.

Mr. Boden prosecuted * and Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Merewether appeared for the defence.
This case stood over from the Midsummer Assizes, when the prisoner was under charge for the murder of the same mary Clarke. She had been his housekeeper from the month of January, 1856, to the time of her death, which took place on the 28th of May last. Her death, which ar
peared to have been occasioned by poison, became the subject of inquiry before the coroner, and a verdict of " Wilful murder" was returned against the prisoner; but at the following assizes the -rand jury ignored the bill presented to them, and an acquittal was taken uponthe coroner's inquisition. There was, indeed, strong ground for believing thati the deceased herself had taken tho poison from the effects of which she died; but upon the posC mnorten examination very serious marks of cxternal ianury were found upon her body, and it appeared that the prisoner had on several occasions used violence towards her she being much addicted to habits of intoxication. An imi
proper intimacy had subsisted between them, but he had threatened to turn her away, and she refused to go. HE had even made a complaint to the police about her drinken. nes. Under these circumstances the grand jury had foundi the indictment upon which -the prisoner was now tried.
A sinle witness proved that on the 23d of May the prisonerliad pushed Mary Clarke out of the house, she being at thteio time very drunk, and had drawn some ribands round her throat and knelt upon her.
The learned JuDoE said tlat, as an assault mas clearly proved, it was tunecessary to extend the inquiry further.
A verdiet of Guilt was then given.
hir. O'BPs3W addressed the judge in mitigation of punishment ; and
HiS LoRDSssW then sentenced the prisoner to three mo-ths' imprisonment, expressing a hope that hi ease would be a warning to every one of the lamentable results of leading an immoral life.-

Mr. bSerjeant Pit ott andl Mr. Clydon APPeared for the laintiff., and r. hateley, Q.C., anid X. Gray, for the defendant.
Tbe laitif, ~nianGutsri, i tha onth of August lat a -e for eight years in thce serie of the defendant, Tomas Willams, a sodawvater rnanufacturer at Wolvet. hampton; and hie brought the present action against his former master to recover damages for maiiciously, and wvithout reasonable or probable cause, causing the plaintiff to be
taken into custody upon a charge of felony. The defendant pleaded only the general issue.
It appeared from the plaintiff's evidence, that the defend. *nt had missed a pocket-knife from off hismantel-piece, and -accused his boy of taking it. The boy denied all knowledge -of the knife; but after his master had given him a good whipping in order to extract the truth, the boy said the plaintiff ad taken it. The defendant had been complaining ,of the plaintiff for neglecting his work, and drinking with -the servant of a man named l4ewmnan, a rival manufaeturer; aid it was suggested that he took advantage of the pocketknife affair to get a warrant for the plaintiff's apprehension on a charge of stealing the knife, in order to revenge him*aelf on the plaintiff for discharging himself from the defendAnt's service to go into his rival's employ. The policeman who aarested the plaintiff on the 21st of August produced -his handcuffs, an was about to put them on the plaintiff,
in accordance vwith the custom which it seems still prevails in this county, though strongly reprobated by Lord Camp.:lell at the Stafford Assizes, except in cases where it was necessary. The plaintiff assured the policeman that it was unnecessary to put the handcuffs on him, for he would go ,quietly; hut they were put on neverthelesg, because, as it was said, the night was dark and vet. The plaintiff was locked up at the police station till the next day, when he 'was taken before a magistrate, and the charge wvas dismuissed. The plantiff then wrote to the defendant demanding comwensation, and received a letter suggesting that it would be ntter to suspend proceedings, as the defeudant was about to take out a summons against him for embezzlement. This was done, but the summons was dismissed, and the present action was then brought.
The defence was, that the defendant bond fide believed that the plaintiff had stolen the knife, and that there was reasonable and probable cause for making the charge. The defendant and several witnesses were caZled in support of this defence, but the boy on whose statement the defendant had acted was not called.
Mr. Justice CROWDER, in summing up the evidence, said that he understood it was the custom in this county, when persons were arrested, whether for misdemeanour or felony, to put handcuffs upon them. Such a custom, however, could .not be too strongly reprobated. It was monstrous that on all occasions such instruments should be made use of ; they vught only to be used where there was resistance, or where *violence was apprehended. His lordship said the constables --of the county ought to be warned by the magistrates as to their duty in this respect. The excuse made in the present case, that the night was dark and wet, amounted to nothing, for there was no reason to expect any resistance from the plaintiff. However, this circumstance would have no effect In this case, unless the defendant, knowing of the custom, made the charge maliciously, and without reasonable or probable cause. His lordship then summed up the evidence with great care, and finaly left it to the jury to say, upon the evidence, whether the defendant, when he made the charge, believed that the plaintiff had stolen the knife.
The jury found that he did not.
Mr. Justice CROWVDER then said he was of opinion that -there was an abeence of reasonable and probable cause, and left it to the jury to say whether the defendant had acted from malicious motives; and, if so, told them they ought to find for the plaintilf, with such moderate damages as they might think him entitled to.
The jury found for the plaintiff-Damages 201.

Mr. Whateley, Q.C., and Mr. Gray appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Serjeant Pigott and Mr. Motteram for the defendant.
The plaintiffs in this action were the assignees of a person named Holder, who was formerly a currier at Walsall, .but who became bankrupt in November, 1855, having liabilities to the extent of nearly 1,9001., and assets to the -extent of only about 4501. The action was brought to recover about 1051., being the value of certain goods which it -was alleged the bankrupt had delivered to the defendant, in contemplation of bankruptcy, by way of fraudulent prefer4ence.
After a long trial, which was concluded after the despatch of our yesterday's report, the jury found a verdict for the defendants.
sRADBmURZ V. DAW.
Mr. Alexander, Q.C., and Mr. Gray appeared for the plaintiff; Mfr. Scotland and Mr. A. S. Hll for the d~efendant.
This was an action in which the plaintiff, a farmer, sought to recover the price of a saw bench, sold bv him to the defendant, and also damages for brench of contract. It Appeared that the plaintiff was anxious to have his corn thrashed out by a. steam-thrashing machine of which the defendant was the owner, and which he was in the habit of letting out on hire, with two men to work it, at 25s. a-day. The plaintiff had a saw bench, which he offered to sel the defendant for 35 guineas, and proposed that the payment should be made by the defendant letting his thrashing machine to the plaintiff for 35 days at 1 guinea a- day. According to the plaintiff's ovidence, the defendant, after some haggling about the price and fiuding some fault 'with the saw bench, agreed to become the purchaser upon the terms mentioned. The saw bench was accordingly delivered at about midnight on the defendant's premises, but the defendant refused to accept it or to sign an agreement in writing which was sent him. He allowed his thrashing machine to do only one day's work for the plaintf The plaintiff now also sought to recover the increased cxpense which he had incurred in gettino- his corn thrashed in consequence of the defendant's breach of contract.
Mr. SCOTLAND caUed the defendant, who swore positively that he had never entered into the agreement alleged that it was arranged that there should be an agreement in wniting drawn up, and that he was not to be bound unless hIe approved and signed the agreement.
Mr. JustiCe CROWDER having summed up the evidence,
The jury found for the plaintiff 361. iSs., the price of the saw bench, and six guineas as damages for the breach of contract.

sEALE (PUBLIc OFFICER) V. CADDICIC AND OTHERS.
Mr. Wheatley, Q.C., and xr. Gray appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Keating, QC., M1r. Huddleston, and Mr. Phipson for the defendant.
This was an action brought by the publio officer of a bank at Stourbridge, caUed the Birmingham and Midland Counties Banking Company, to recover the sum of 9091. 4s. 4d., being the amount of an account due by the defendant Elisha Caddick, and his former partner Hartland, to the bank. Hartland had suffered judgment by default, and the only question now was as to Caddick's liability. The case was of no publio interest, and the trial resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff for 6681., execution being stayed in order that the defendant might have an opportunity of taking the lopinion of the Court on certain points of law.
Mr. Justice CROWVDER expressed his opinion that it 'would have been much better if the dispute had been referred and settled.

It appeared that, immediately on the discovery of the burglary, the polce sent a description of the property stolen to the different pawnbrokers in the town, and this commumication led to the apprehension of James Simeox the day following. So early as S o'clock on the morning of the 26th a coat and trousers which formed a part of the plunder were pawned by him at Mr. Carryer's. A box, proved to be the box of the same prisoner, and which bad been carried away from his lodgings bythe other prisoner, Wiiam, immediately after his (James's) apprehenpion,was found concealed in a field, and in this box was found the remainder of the articles stolen. It also contained the produce of four other burglaries.

It appered that a fire took place and did much datmage to MUr. Blarnard's farm on the night of the 2d of last December. Oni FSunday morning, the 28th about 1 o'clock, footatepa were heard at the distance of i 00 yards from the farm, and immediately after a doggavetheIarm wlhich had the

That person, however, deposed that the prisoner came in a contrary direction-that is, from, and not to, Bidwell. It was also proved that, though he had been to Danstable, and spoken to his sweetheart as he said, he could not by possibility have seen the fire from Mix's-way at the time he stated, as the fire was then too low, and a hill intervened between Mix's-wa andthe farm. The damage done by the fire was about ful.
The jury returned a verdict of Guilty.
His Lordship, in passing sentence, remarked that he was not uncharitable when he supposed that this was not the first crime of the kind the prisoner had committed. The prisoner was sentenced to transportation for 20years.
(Before tlC LoxD CorrEn BARON.)
William Everett and James Dewberry were charged with night. poahing in the preserves of the Duke of Bedford at Eve=ott.
MIr. Power prosecuted; Mr. Stephenson appeared for the prisoners.
On the night of the 30th of December a keeper and three assistants were watching in Woburn-park. when they heard the report of guns in one of the neighbouring preserves. On going to the spot they found a party of seven poachers, who retired, presenting their guns and sticks. One of them saia, " Stand back, or we'll blow your brains out !" and thereupon a shot was fired in the direction jof the keepers, and several shots were fired among the trees, with the apparent intention of intimidating the keepers. The poachers dispersed, and a short time after, the keepers,who nad crossed a wall in pursuit ot some of the poachers, saw the two prisoners cominig along a road, and took them into custody. They both appeared to be much blown and very hot; and snares, a powder horn, and a small bottle of aniseed (supposed to be useful in allurinz pheasants) were found upon them. Dewberry was without his cap, which was next day discovered at the place where the keepers and poachers first met.

The Case Of Mr. W. H. Barber.-On Monday
THE CASE OF MR. WW H. :B nBEB.-On Monday morning a deputation, consisting of Sir Fitzroy Kelly, M.P., Mr. Cobden, M.P., Mr. F. Crossley, M.P., Mr. Headlam, M.P., Mr. Serjeant Ballantine, Mr. Serjeant Parry, Mr. C. W. Dilke, MIr. W. Wills, the Rev. J. G. Wood, Mr. N. Gedge, Mr. R. Lane, and other gentlemen, waited upon Lord Palmerston at Cambridge-house, for the purpose of laying before his Lordship a claim to compensation by Mr. William Henry Barber, the solicitor, whose case in connexion with certain will and other for"eries some vears ago is Well known to the public. Sir F. Kelly stated to his Lordship that in 1844 Mr. Barber, who was then a solicitor in good practice, became protessionally connected with a man named Fletcler, for whom he did a considerable amount of legal business. This man Fletcher was in the habit -of ascertaining from the Bank of England particulars of unclaimed stock, and then informing the parties who were entitled to it of the fact, receiving a commission for his trouble on the amount secured. Subsequently Fletcher forged-the names of persons who were entit ed to this stock, an in some cates wills where the persons were deceased. Barber transacted the legal portion of the business for him, but was not aware of the frauds which were being committed. On an investigation taking place, discoveriesof frauds to a large amount were detected, and the result vas that Fletcher and Barber were tried at the Old Bailey together. Barber's counsel were very anxious that he-should he tried separately, in order that Fletcher and other partes to the transaction might be called as witnesses; hut -this the Attorney-Generai (the present Lord Chief Baron;) refused. They were found guilty, and transported for 'life. Barber was sent to Norfolk Iliand, where me endured every imaginable kind of torment. Some of the officials there. hearing of the nature of his case, made in-
siries into-it, and made representations which induced Sir 'George Grey, -the then Heone Secretary, to grant a conditional -pardon, -the conditio. being that Mr. Barber should xot come into rreat Britain. He wandered aboutthe Continent until Lord 3ormanby tookup his case, and he received a full pardon. For many yeas after the Court of Queen's Bench -reftsed -hint permission to practise, bat at length tha£ right -hashbeenlyiekled. Mr. Barber had suffered Bo nauch that the deputationthought he was entitled to compensation, rnore especigly as the State, who' were the prosecutors, had made go grimeous a mistake. Serjeants Parry and Ballantine, Mr. Readlam, M.P., Mr. Gedge, and other gentlemen, having xrged Mr. Barber's claims, Lord Palmerston said he could not seethad the Government had been wrong, or how the judges, the jury, the courts of law, or the Crown could have taken any otLer course. It was certainlya great misfortune that Mr. Barber had been mixed up with such bad company, and that -he had not exercised more precantion. It was a rather novel course to apply for compensation in such a ease, and the way-in which such a request could be acceded to was not quite obvioui. On the spur df the moment he cJl& not say what he could do, but he would consult his cdlleigues upon the subject. Mr. Crossley, MYP., assured his Lordship that in the north of England, with whse1e'h**as connected as a manufacturer, and among members of the House of Commons, there was A very strong opinion th-at:r. Barber should be compensated. After some forther conversation the deputation withdrer.

POLICE.
MANSION-HOUSE.-Mr. James Hill and Mr. Thoma Brough, coal-factors, carrying on business at 28, St. Maryat-Hill, appeared before the LoUD MAYOR in answer to a summons which had been issued at the instance of Messrs. Harrison and Co., owners of the Ratcliffe Colliery, near Newcastle-on-Tyne, and which charged them with having, as agents of Measrs. Harison and Co. converted to their own use two bills of exchange of the respective sums of 1001. 13s. 6d. and 100&, which had been intrusted to them for a specifc purpose.
Mr. Sleigh appeared in support of the prosecution, and 31r. Hobler attended on the part of the defendants.
Mr. Hobler asked for an adjournment of the case, on the ground that he had only just been instructed in the ruatter.
Mr. Sleigh resisted the application, saying that the summons had been issued on the 8th inst., and that the defendants had therefore had plenty of time to instruct any professonal adviser upon their behalf. In addition to this, witnesses were in attendance from Newcastle and from several banking-houses.
The LoRD MAYoR, after a short discussion, said that under all the circumstances the case must be gone into.
Mr. Sleigh.-I have the honour to appear here, my Lord Mlayor, to prosecute this charge against the defendants, and it is a charge beyond all doubt of the very greatest importance, whether as regards them or as regards the mercantile community generaUly. The summons upon which they now stand before you has been issued under that which is known as the Bankers' or Factors' tct, an act which wasvery much discussed in a late celebrated case (that of Strahan, Paul, and Bates), and an act which, among other things, enacts " That if any money or security for the payment of money shall be intrusted to any banker, nerchant, broker, attorney, or other agent, with any direction in writing to apply such money, or any part thereof, or the proceeds, or any part of the proceeds of such security, for any purpose specified in such direction, and he shall, in violation o good faith, and contrary to the purpose so specified, in anywise convert to his own use or benefit such money, security, or proceeds, or any part thereof respectively, every such offender ehall be guilty of a misdemeanour." That is the 7th and 8th of George IV., chap. 20, sec. 49. There is a proviso in a subsequentiportion of the statute, to which it is not necessary that I should call your particular attention, except that it is intended to protect persons who have a proper lien upon any such security from being criminally proceeded against. The prosecutors are the owners of the Ratcliffe Colliery, atWarkworth, near Newcastle-on-Tyne, gentlemen of the highest respectability, and well known in that port of the country; and the defendants have been for some time carrying on business, trading under the firm of James Hill and Co., as coal-factors and agents for coliers in the north of England, at 28, St. Mary-at-HilL
The LoRD MAYoR.-The Coal.Exchange is at the corner of St. Mary-at-Hill. Messrs. Hill and Co., of the CoalExchange, are gentlemen of the highest character and respectability, and it ought to be made known that the present charge is not against them.
MSr. Sleigh continued.-It is, perhaps, as well that I should shortly narrate the course of business adopted as regards the owners of collieries in the north of England and their agents in London. Coals are sent to London consigned to these porsons, who are either the purchasers or the agents selling them on commission for their principals in the north. An account current is kept between the parties-a credit and debit in the usual way-and from time to time the principals in the north draw upon their agents in London biUs of exchange for proximate amounts. The draughts are accepted by the agents in London, they arein the usual course paid at maturity, and go into the account current. If they pay more than they owe the balance goes to their credit, if they pay less the parties on the other side are debited. It appears that in February in tho present year there became due a draught upon the defendaLts drawn by the prosecutors for 3501. It was dated Newoastle-on-Tyne, the 20th of November, 1856, and wasatthree months'; consequently, in theordinary course of business, it would arrive at maturity on the 23d of February, 1857. A few days before this draught became due Mr. Harrison happened to be in London, and had an interview with one of the defendants, and, in consequence of what then took place, he on his return to Newcastle remitted to the defendants two bills of exchange, one upon Messrs. Coutts and Co. for 1001 13s. od., and another upontheBankof England forlOO1,which wereto be ap ropriated towards a purpose mentioned ina letter which w hereafter be put in evidence, but in violation of good faith theycashe thebils, they paid the money intotheirbanker's, and drew checks in favour of various people for the amount. The consequence was that when the bill for 3501. became due there were "I no effects." 'Under all the circumstances it will be for the Court to say whether the defendants have not been guilty of a misappropriation of securities intrusted to them for a particular purpose.
M1r. John Harrison, one of the prosecutors, was then sworn, and said,-The defendants carry on business at 20, St. Mary-at-Hill, as agents and coal-factors, and have been in the habit of acting as our agents for the last two and a half or three years. Our course of business was for our firm to draw on the defendants bills of exchange for amounts representing the value of coals sen' to London. Sometimes the draughts would be under and sometimes they would exceed the amount of coals sent. In November last we drew a bill of exchange upon the defendants for 350., which became due on the 23d of February. It was accepted by the defendants, and was payable at Messrs. Glyn's. Upon the 20th of February I remitted to the defendants two bills of exchange, one for 100l. 13s. 6d. on Messrs. Coutts and Co., the other for 1004 on the Bank of England. Those three biUs are now before me. The bills for 1001. l3s. 6d. and 1001. were remitted to the defendants in a letter which I wrote to them. (The letter was read.) On the 25th of February the bill for 3501. was returned to us dishonoured, and we had to pay the amount. A few days ago I attended a meeting of the defendants' creditors, at which they were present. A day or two before the meeting I saw both of them at their office, when some conversation took place between us. I told them that the bill for 3501., to pay which I had sent them 20014 odd, had been retmrned to me, and that by not
ying it tbey had misappropriated my money. I told them rhey would be obliged to pay me the 2001 odd back again, or I must have them up before the Lord Mayor. The defendant Brough said he would consult his solicitor upon the subject. The defendants both left, and upon their retura Brough said that his solicitor had advised them to pay the money back by all means. This was said in Hill'spresence. Brough afterwards gave me an order upon his solicitor for the amount, but I did not get paid. At the meeting of creditors the liabilities of the defendants were stated to be something like 1,7001., and the assets, which consisted of book debts, about 300. The endorsement on the bius for 1001. and 100G. 13s. 6d. is in the handwriting of Brough.
Mr. Hobler having stated that he was not in a situation to cross-examine the witness at present, the farther hearing of the charge was adjourned till Thiursday next, the defendants entehring into their own recognisuces in 2.50. each to appear on that day.
BOWV-STREE.-A young man named Robert Goodacre, formerly a clerk in the service of Mr. H. R. Abrahams, surveyor, of Ijoward-street, Strand, was charged with uttering several forged checks at Messrs. Drummond's bank in Charing-cross.

He was paid the amaount of the two checks, 441. 10s., in one 20&-note, two 101.-notes, and 414 10s. in gold. Subeequently it was ascertained that the three checks were forgeries. Information was then given to the police, and Sergeant Robinson, of the detective force, was stationed. at the bank to await the presentation of the notes. On M1oaday afternoon the prisoner bimself presented at the Bank the 201-note and one of the IO4-notes paid to him on, Saturday. When interrogated as to whed he got them, he said from~ Mr. Williams, of John-st-reet, Adelphi, adding that he was in that gentleman's employ as clerk. Robinson then made himself known, and took the prisoner into custody. On the way to the station he admitted thar his former statement was untrue, and that he had got the notes in payment of a check at Drummond's on Saturday. Robinson asked if he wrote the check himself, and he said "No- another man sent me with it. He refused to say who the otker man was.

was about to reside, with a view to her proper instruction. He took Bome interest in the case, having learnt from her mistress that she had conducted herself well, and hoped that her improvement might be real and lasting. She refused to let him do this, and left him much dissatisfied. A few days since she again called, and said that she had left her place, and being disengaged for a fewl days wished to be baptized before going to a new situation. His curate, who saw her, not knowing all the circumstances of the case, had already appointed to see her, when she came on Monday morning to his (Mr. Borradaile's) house, and insisted that be shonld, without any further inquiry orinstraction, baptine her within two days, and threatened that unless he did go she would appeal to a magistrate. He had no alternative but to decline a demand made in such total ignorance of the sacred nature of the ordinance and in a temper so foreign to a due reception of it, and the consequence was her appeal to Mr. ARNOLD, theough not till after he (Mr. Borradaile) had renewed his offer to write to the clergyman under whose charge she was
-bout to be placed. In conclusion the rev. gentleman said he thought it due both to the wor'y magistrate and himself to offer tha above explanation.
SOUTHWARK-Caroline Grays and Mary Ann Srcofeld, two young women showily dressed, were brought up in custody, charged with stealing a purse containing two sovereigns, two half-sovereimus, five shillihgs and nine pence, and two gold rings, Krom the person of Eliza Ann P'ords. Both prisoners are natives of Lancashire, and evidently connected with a gang of thieves infesting the crowded thoroughfares of the metropolis.
The prosecatrix, a yoang lady, residing at the Hoy Inn, near Deptford, said that on the previous after noon, shortly after 4 o'clock, she was looking in at a milliner's window in Newington-causeway. She had at that time her purse and money safe in her dress pocket. While stauding there a number of women surrounded her and pushed rudely against her. A little girl came up to her, and told her one of them had taken something out of her pocket; and, on feeling, she missed her parse. The prisoners were just behind her, and Grays was pointed out by the girl as the person who had robbd her. Witness immediately accused both of them, when Grays dropped the purse and they both ran away. Her pue was picked up and handed to her, when she foand the contents safe.
Thomas Slim, engineer, of Deptford, said, he was walking along Newington-causeway on the previous afternoon when he saw the prisoners follow several ladies, lift up their dresses, and try their pockets. There were abont a dozen other women with them, acting in concert. Witness followed them, and saw Grays lift up Miss Ford's dress, while the other prisoner covered her with her muff, and as soon as they were detected they ran off. Grays was taken on the spot, and witness followed Scofield to a house in the London-road, where she was secured. He was positive they were both connected with the robbery.
Henry Lowden, apainter, of Deptford, said, he saw Grays drop the purse, which he. picked. up and handed to the prosecutrix.
Police-constable 123 P said, he pursued Scofield into a house up a court in the London-road. and, after a desperate resistance, in which she scratched his face and injured him very much, he succeeded in taking her into castody. She was searched at the stationhouse, and on her was found 21. Is. lid. in gold and silver.
The prisoners, who asked for the assistance of an attorney to defend them, were remanded until Thursday. They declared that they were strangers to each other.
Samuel Weddows, a portly and very respectable-looking man,!a clerk in the,employ of Mr. Bacon, of Neckinger-road, Bermondsey, was charged with embezzling large sams of money, the property of Mr. Robeit Tossweu, of Castlenanvilla Barnes, in whose service he had been as confidential clerk.~
Mr. Toswell stated that, owing to il health, he relnquished business as a tanner and fellmonger, in the Neckinger-road, about six months ago, and ?Mr. Bacon succeeded him. The prisoner, who had been his clerk for a long time, remained in the same capaity with Mr. Bacon. Xt had been his duty to coUect money from witness's customers, and account for the same as soon as receiving them; and since he had retired the prisoner had stiUl authority to do so. A few days ago witness went round to some of his customers, when he ascertained that the prisoner had received upwards of 1001. and not accounted to him for the same, so he gave information to the police, and hadhim apprehended.
Mr. John Lock stated that he had been,a customer of Mr. Tosswell's, and carried on business as a bootmaker in Higbh street, Woolwich. He owed the prosecutor an account of 261., and paid the amount to the prisonera short time ago. He produced the receipt in the prisoner's handwriting.
Inspector Mlackintosh, who apprehended the prisoner, asked for a remand, as Mr. TossweU had not been able to examine his hooks to ascertain the extent of the depredations, and to produce other witnesses to complete the case. He nuderstood that the prisoner was a defaulter to a very serious extentv
The prisoner, who seemed very much dejected, made no reply, and was remanded.

*Mr. Warren wil be harb,y to have an interview with tho adrertiser respecting her advertisement in I Tbo Titnes' of this week. Mr. Warren wil be in the eonod-clas waiting room at the Great Western Railway at 12 o'clock on Monday, the 9th of Mlarch, and iC B. L wil hav thisnote inher haLd there cannot aise any mistake.

Trusting all was right I left B- by the express train on Monday morning for Paddington. On my arrival I immediately repaired to the place appointed, where, after vaiting a short time, I was joined by a man, who, apologisug for speaking to me, said he was sent by a gentleman to meet z lady from B- by the " express," and, in order that there might be no mistake, she was to carry a letter in her hand. Upon my stating myself to be the lady in question, he informed me Mr. Warren was exceedingly sorry be could not see me directly, but urgent business would detain him for about an hour; bnt would I go to an hotel, where he would come to me as soon as possible ' Suspecting no evi I followed, ubt expressed a wish to remain at the Great Western Hotl ; but, on his saying he was desired by Mr. Warren to take me to a respectable house, and he knew the " Mint Hotel" to be such, I consented, when he left mo to inform Mr. Warren of my arrival. At a quarter before 2 o'clock, to my surprise, the man himself returned, instoad of the Mr. Warren I was expecting. He stated that Mr. Warren was still much engaged, but would use all possible speed in coming to me; but in the meantime, as a sort of introduction, would I answer a few questions, which, if not proving satifactory, he would again return me my expenses. ln order, Sir, not to take up too much of your valuable time, I will merely say the questions were only such as I have often before been asked in the capacity of governess, and therefore created no alarm; but upon my seeking for information I found, to my astonishment, Mr. Warren was a bachelor, his views matrimonial, and seeking a lady to go with him to New Zealand. not requiring my services till tho end of the voyae ?Nowv, understanding the characters I had to deal with, I thought the less I said the better; hbt, hoping to recover my expenses, which wiere a serious loss to me, Ipron;isedto remain one hour longer, when he said he would return with the amsount. In the meantime I ascertained from the landlord that the man wasnotknowntohim. Attheendcof two hours, instead of one, the barmaid brought me an open piece of paper, which he had just left, written on it Mmrs.-, Bayswater Tavem. Immediately."

Sir,-Fe pay a heavy Police rate here, as elsewhere, but to what purpose ? My house, which is not isolated, although detached, haLs been twice attempted by thieves in open day;- the robbers, on one occasion, having actnally oh. tained admisejon to a bedroom on the npper story. So much for the defence of property! As regards person, I merely add that two elderly ladies were, a few days ago, accosted and annoyed by tvo sturdy beggars, in a path between two hedges, situate within a few varus of the parish church, and within a stone's throw of a crowvded thoroughfare.

HMs Royal Highness the General Commanding-in.Chief has signified to Major.General Breton, commanding the South-West District, at Port6anouth, his intention of in. specting, one day this week, on Southsea-common, the troops quartered in Portsmouth Garrison who are under orders to embark for China Preporations are being made to give 6da to the first offlicial visit of th gallant Duke to* Portsmouth.
The Shannon, 51, Captain Pee, C.B., Vc., &c., got; away from Spithead under steam yesterday morning, at a
quarter before 8, for China, with munitions of war, rein! forcements of men, &c. When a mite to the eastward of the Nab she made sail and shaped her course down Channel under topsails, jib, and foretopmast staysaD, with a strong easterly breeze. She was shortly out of gight.
The saiing sloop Electra, 14, Commander Morris, received counter orders on Monday evening to those she had previously reoeived to go into Portsmouth harbour to be paid off. She accordingly discharged her freight, 14,176 ounces of gold, into the stesa& tender Sprightly to be landed, and then sailed for Chatham to be pxid off. She had on board Mr. Williams (chief mate), Mr. Whiteman (second mate), and six hands, part of the crew of the ship Lord George Bentinek, of Liverpool, which fouDdered in a heavy gale on the 22d of November last off the Falkland Ilands The boat and those in her got adrift from the ship, and having no oars could not regain the ship, and were compelled to leave Captain Lindsay, the steward, and two seamen on the wreck, the ship at the time lying on her beam ends, in a heavy sea. For six days and nights they drifted on the sea with no provisions or water. On the morning of the seventh day the men in the boat proposed to draw lots to sacrifice one to save the others, but were fortunately prevented carrying this horrible alternative into effect by a sail heaving in sight at 8.30 a.m., which proved to be the brig Cuba, of London, Captain Gray, who took the starving seamen on board, clothed them, and otherwise treated them with the greatest kindness, and proceeded with the-m to the Falklxndsg six of the crew there shipped in other vessels, the other six and Messrs Williams and Whitehead came to England in the Electra, with the news of the catastrophe.
The Secretary of State for War has issued directions that the office of Paymaster of the British depOts and detachments stationed at Chatham shalU be abolished after the 1st of April next, and the staff kept up for that purpose discontinued. Itis also ordered'that, with the view of lessening the great expense now incurred in keeping up that department of the service, the whole of the troops on the British establishment attached to the Provisional Battalion shall be handed over to Captain J. H. Matthews, Paymaster of the Invalid Depot at Chatham.
TheLords of the Admiralty have sanctioned a change of divisions between Captain W. IL Maxwell, of tho Chatham division of Royal Marines, and Captain P. ML C. Croker, of the Plymouth division.
In consequence of the fatal accident which occurred off Chatham dockyard on Saturday last by the capSizing of the cutter from the Fantome, 12, during a squall, when tvo seamen, named Thompsett and Minton, were drowned, an order has been issued that for the future no boats will be allowed to use their sails when engaged in passing to and fro betweenuthe vessels and the dockyard.
The officers belonging to the depots now stationed at Chatham are required to go through a course of instruCtion in the use of the Enfield rifle, under Captain W. Nott, before proceeding to join the service companies of their corps in India and China.
The four companies of Royal Artilery at Woolwich, under orders for China, have been reinforced by a transfer of the required number of men from the other battalions to fill up the vacancies The companies are now fuU strength, and the whole of the men, having gone through medical attestation and been pronounced efficient for service, are awaiting orders for embarcation. The other six companies of artiery at Woolwich, under orders for Nova Scotia, Canada, and the Mauritius, are likewise ready Lfor departure.
The third of the new class of gunboats, the Leven (two of which, the Algerine and the Lee, Lre in a forward state for service), arrived at Woolwich yesterday morning from Northfleet. The fourth, to be ca1led the Slaney, will be launched and forwarded to Woolwich for fitment to.day.
The paddlewheel steam storeshit Rthadamanthus, Master Commander Browne, returned toWoolwich yesterday morning from Portsmouth. She was admitted into basin, and is orered to commence embarking steam machinery and boilers for the western yards.
The paddlewbeel steamer Spitfire, in basin at Woolwich, after a thorough readjustment of machinery and sundry repami, is now ready for recommission.
The steam storeship Hesper, in Woolwich basin, is ordered to be fitted with Griffith's patent screw-propeller, which possesses the advantage of enablinz its angle to bo altered at sea, so as to place the blades in lino with the keel when under sail, without the necessity of unshipping the scew. To give her as much advantage as possible of canvass she is ordered to bo rigged bark fashion. She is intended to convoy the guns and war stores belonging to the gunboats under orders forChina.
Some plates of newly-discovered metal resembling ordinary steei, and denominated by the patentee homogeneous metal, have been introduced at Woolwich dockyard, under the sanction of the Lords of the Admiralty, and are ordered to be put through the usual test for proving the strength of metal, and to verify its competency for the purpose of making ship,J boilers. This metal has the advantage over malleable iron of being considerably lighter, and much more durable.
MLr. IL H. Pearson, of Her Majesty's ship Pembroke, has been appointed First Assistant-Engineer to Her Majesty's ship Cornwallis, at Hull, vice Mr. Matthews, who exchanges.
The following appoimtments were made yesterday at the Admiralty :-Lieutenant 3. W. Armstrong, to the Cormorant; Spencer Chapman, naval cadet, to the Furious; John M. Hockley, master in command, to the Volcano; and Pierce Mansfield, cting assistant-surgeon, to the Waterloo.

Tho Tyne steamer was taken into graving dock this afternoon, and her repairs wRill be immediately proceeded with.
FouLA Musurm.-On the evening of the 3d of February Mrs. Ward, wife of Return J. AL Ward, in Sylvania, disappeared in a very mysterious manner. The ensuing morning her husband visited Mr. Allen's grocery in the vllage, and informed him that he and his wife were going away, and desired Mr. Allen to tell those who might wish to see him that he had left the place. On tho Thursday following Ward again visited tho grocery and had another conversation with Mr. Allen. Hethistimesaid that his wife had left him again. She had once, in consequence, as it is believed, of ill-treatment, left him for a brief penod. Allen asked him, " When did she leave ?" Ward replied, "On Tuesdaynightlast. Sbe took the carshere, saying that she was going to California." Ward made this statement to a number of the citi7ens, and it was so much at variance withhis previous statement at Allen'sthatsnspieions of fonl play wrer uninediately excited. These suspicions wecre furthered by other circumstanens, and it was determined that theaffair shonldbe thoroughly sited. Wardwasarrested and examined before Mfr. Justice Clark. It was proved at the examination that Ward's last statement at Allen's was nrtrue, but the evidence was not sufficient to warrant the jus7ice in committing him. Some of the citizens, however, were by no means satisfied of Ward's innocence, and they endeavoured to still more thoroughly solve the singular affair. They tborounhly searched Ward's premises, and found most indubitabla evidence that the woman had been foully murdered, and that her body had been burnt in her own house. In a pilo of ashes near the house human bones were found,-an upper jaw, almost entire, and pieces of a skull. Two finger-rings wero also found, which were recognized as those worn by Mfrs. Ward. The citizens who made the search found abundant evidenc, as they thought that the effects of Mrg. Ward had been all burnt. The lock of her trunk, pieces of dresses, hooks and eyes, and other articles were found. The citizens searched further. The bedclothes in the house had the appearance of having been recently washed. On opening the bolster and bed the feathers were found covered with blood. Blood was also found on a mat in the upper part of the house. A minute search revealed traces of blood in other parts of the house. Whether the woman had been stabbed or shot they could not tell, hut that she had been foully murdered and her corpse burnt they were satisfied, and at once proceeded to cause the second arrest of Ward. Ile was arrested and again examined before Mr. Justice Clark, and was commutted to the gaol in this city to await trial before the next term of the Conrt of Common Pleas for murder in the firs' degree. During Ward's trial the justice's office was crowded to suffocation, and the excitement is tremendous throughout the township. Ward is a tailor by trade. He has been married three times. He married the deceased in Adrian some time last summer, and carried her to Sylvania Weare told the Zdi inot live together pleasantly. Once, as before stated, e woman temporarily left him, in conseqnence, it wag supposed, of bad treatment.

City Court Of Sewers.
CITY COURZ OF SEWERS.
Yesterday the Commissioners assembled at the Guildhball Deputy Peacock in the chair.
A report from the Improvemeat Committee on Cemetery business, recommending the Court to concur in the Bill in, parliament, was brought up.
Mr. DE JxRsEY objected to the report, as tlbe BiU made* an extravagant provision for the clergy at the expense o- the parishioners of the city of London, and proposed as alr
amendment that * comparatively small portion of thground should be consecrated in order to remedy to a certain extent the evil thus likely to be perpetuated. Ire oon4 sidered that the Commissioners, wlho had in the beft. spirit undertakena to carry out the object of construrtn* the oemetery, and adapting itito the wants of the parsihee; had been overridden by the elaoorate men of business of the sacred profession.
llr. Deputy BitOwV seconded the amendmuent, and shtte4 that he was decidedly opposed to any projet for paying thqt clergy in perpetuity.
lMlr. A AIL said that at the same time that he agreed
with Mr. Do Jersey in the objection raised to the reportA he could not but think it dangerous to oppose the Bill, whicbL prob6bly, as it now stood, would be allowed to pass, bot, it objected to by the Court, might be subjected to clauses og' an Inurnous tendenoy to the citizen5 of London. (Hear, hear.)
Mr. Deputy BOE& did not see how under the existing circumstances, the Court could better Itself by negativing the report. The Court had been overreached. The Act; was against them, but they had ado pted it, and they couldi not now help them selves. (Hear, heru.) He thought the clergy had exhibited a grasping spirit in calling upon thor paris cs to pay In perpetuity, but what could now be doneo
he act that the arrangements as they now stood were
baSSigh servicebletothe clll h ergymight give facility to thebe ompetey ostrctd. pedin diferntway, mightThe report was then agreed to, the mover and secondeof the amendment being the only members who held up their-
THE MTROPOLTAN BOARD OF WVORKS.
Mr. PAYNE, the chief clerk to the Chamberlain, attended and laid before the Commissioners the priept reoeivel from the Metropolitan Board of Works to4pay to theig bankers 5,550l. 6s. 8d. towards the costs and charges of thaft =oardfor the year 1856.
MIr. DAW, the chief clerk to the Commimsioners, readl the document at length. Mr. Daw also read at length a re. Port prepared by himr explaining the grounds on which thet charge bad beernimade by the Metropolitan Board, froni. w h itappearedthat the Board having on the 1st ofTJantiu
arT, 1856, been rendered liable to an old debt of 140,O00&. raised for purposes of main and intercepting drainage br the late Commissioners of Sewers, now charged the cil oV London with 14,185L. 3s. lld, towards the same, andYreq
dire to bo paid at once two years' instalments of suck ucbt, amonnting for 1855 to 1,5l&. Os. 5d., aud for 1856 to 1,3841. 18s.. The Board also required the further sum of 2,70. 2s. lOd. towards the establishment charges, salaries., compensation allowances, &c., of the Metropolitan Boarti for t he year 1856, and a sum of 62C. 4s. lld. for sundry smallermatters. The city was credited by the accounts of' the Board with 14,9311.15s. 9d. against its future liabilities for main drainage.
It was then agreed, after some discussion, to'refer thd precept and the report to the (7ommittee of General Par.
es, to inquire into them before the issue of an ordeg fors payment.
