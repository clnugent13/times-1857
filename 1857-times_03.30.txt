The production of Verdi's Tra1iata, for J64do andifadame Bosio, Will be commented on variouslr,- but there can be only one opinion of the propriety of introducing one of the operas of Mercadante, the most neglected though by no means the least eminent of modern Iuh

$A f lD HARfMONIC SOCIBTY.
The star of Isracd inaEgyptat length promises to be in the ascendant. Although regarded by musical judges As. tho most masterly work of its composer, ithis neveryet attained its jUSt share of publicity.. Partially obscured by the astonishing brilliancy of 27w lce6h5 which is allied 7o a subject enlsting universal sympathies, rfrd has not hitherto enjoyed the same chances of popuarity as that nost universally understood and apprecated of all ora. toios. Another drawback has stood in its .r -namely, the few airs and duets for the' exhibition of the anger's talent on the one hand, I nd the vast number and elaborate construction o ,the
choruses (which distinguish IDrael in Egypt front every corresponding sacred work, either of Handel or his successors) on the other; and, lastly, the extraordinary difficulty of many of these choruses, which have perplexed chorus singers and music directors time out of mind. In Handel's own day so great were the obstacles offered by the peclarities we have cited that Israd in E#ypt was rarely performed as originally composed; and the author, who could not but be oonscious that it wa& his finest work, nust bave felt deeply humiliated at being compelled to solicit public attention to its merits through the intervention of what, under the circumstauces, can only be designated as "clap-trap." Songs and other pleces froln inferior compositions were interpolated; and so this immnortal masterpiece frequently assumed the shape of what was little better than apasticcio.
But the above incidenats getherswth the history and pln of Isradl in Egypt, havoa been more than once related and commented on at periods when the oratorio was produced at the concerts of the Sacrod Harmonic Society. On such occasions, moreover, it has generally been our duty to complain of manifold imperfections in the performance. We have now a pleasanter tak. The first (we trust not the last) performance of Israel in Egypt this season has conferred the highest possible credit upon the inmembers of the Sacred Harmonio Society and their accomplished conductor. As this is to constitute one of the three oratorios to be given during the great festival in horour of Handel at the Cryst Pala7ce, it has no doubt enjoyed the advantage of more than usually careful prepara. tion. Nevertheless, whatever the cause, there can be no doubt that an execution so generally effective of Israel in
wMPt was never acoomplished before in Exeter-hall, or probably anywhere else. go satisfactory, indeed, was the result that even the impracticable chorus, " The people shall hear," went wcll, and was sung in almost irreproachable tune throughotut. The whole of the first part-which includes the sufferings of the hardly-burdened Israelites under the dominion of that Pharaoh e'which knew not Joseph," the plagues brought uporn the Egyptians by Divine power through the interposition of Moses, and the miraculous passage through the depths of the Red Sea-was niarvellously rendered. Every chorus told, and the encore elicited by " He gave them hail. ,tenes," thoroughly well dcserved as it was, must, nevertheless, be regarded rather as a tribute to the immediately recognized beauties of a familiar masterpiece than as an *cknowledgment of the execution having been superior to that of any other chorus in this portion of the oratorio. The second part-from the overpowering " lorse and his rider" to the conclusion, where that sublime hymn of exultation and worship is repeated-was almost equally gratifying. Some exceptions might be made, it is true
but in so admirable a performance it would be mere hyper. criticism to insist upon a few minor defects, which alone prevented the whole from being apostrophized as blame. less. The audience were evidently impressed in the highest degree, and many, proviously incredulous, were heard to avow that Israe it Egsypt, if not greater thsmn Tic Mecssinh, was at least quite as great-a proposition which, with those competent to form an opinion, IS incontrovertible. The interesting *nd comprehenstve treatise of Mr. Macfarren, -as sound an autharity upon grare mnsical questions
s an in Europe-circulated among the audience in the shape of w7hat Mr. Ella terms st" analytical programme," helped materilly to the enjoyment and understanding of thte colosisal work of wrhich, though Handel himself was so reasonably proud of it, it remained for posterity to recognie and admit the w ,orth.
The solo sngers-Madame Weiss, b lissDolby, Mr. MoTeuem Smith, Signor Belottioand b . Thomas-anll exerted them selves in such a mtanner as to win unnaimous favporval. The purest Handelian singing of the evening was demon. strated in the two ooniralto airs, "Their Casd brought forth frogs," and "Thou ahalt bring them in," both of which were given to rfection by Miss Dolbyp The duet for two bases, "The Lord is a man of war,' declaimed withgreat animatiOn by Mr. Thomas and Sirnor Belletti, sas honoured by thesteteotyped encore-bno nnesn favourable, by the fay, to the general effect of the performance, since theduet itself is verw long, and, one or two o passges ex-
cepted, not one oF Han~elrs most remarkable compositions. &Ti the terznination of the oratorio Mr. COBta JSs loudly alpplauded, and the complimuent was well deserved, for never wvas an elaborate and, difficult work br;ou,t before the public in a style more nearly approaching to perfection. How much Mr. Costa must have hlad T;O do with ehisneed scarcely be insisted on.
The 3fesaiak is announced for WVednesday in Passion wveek, and on Friday next a choral rehearsal of the samne oratorio for the Crysgal Palace Festival willtake place in Exeter-hall, at which 1,100 " picked" vocal performers w ill. assst._

CITy OF LOlIDOlT.
TaZ POLLIG.
ThopolUeommeneod at 8 o'clock ia the morning, and asted till 4 p.m. The votesof the liverymen were taken at tho Gufldha4 and those of the inhob.tant householders at 18 dfferen, polling-places, distributed throagh the varioua wards into which the eitY is divided. Without some ash arraugement tAere would be the danger of too great an Ilux of voters at one point, and great inooavenience would bse experienced ia confining the constitutional wstiocx o£ so large a constituency within the brief eight hours allowed for Its choioe of representatives. The fervid appeals addressed to the electors to " rush to the poll' as soon as it was opened tn* but aprtil responwe on the part-of the citizens, none bat the most zealous pdatisans complying with such a denanad on thotr patriotism as was involved in rising early enough to record their votes by 8 o'clock. Fewer than 500 votes were given in the first hour, but by 10 o'clock the
inumber had increased to 1,500. Lord J. Russoll clamed to take the lead from the outset, although the committee of the four candidates at first put hir some eight or ten votes below their most popular man, Baron Rothschild; and, amcording to the figures issued by both parties, the other three Liberals followed in this order :-Sir J. Dake, Mr. COrawford, and M1r. Currie. At 11 o'clock -Lord J. Russell. by the admission of his opponents, headed the poll by 89 votes, Baron Rothchilda being 3econd, and the other candidates preserving the same relative positions as above-Mr. CVrtie, however, stiUl failing further and further behind. To influenoe the electors on behalf of the " Liberal and Commercial candidates," the mot d!ordrc was given, " No plumping-vote for all four el while, in the interest of the other side, a placard appeared stating that " Baron Rothschild, if elected, will not take his seat."
Lord J. Russell, Sir J. Duke, and the other candidate3 visited the various poUing-places during the day, and stimulated their respective adherents to increased activity by their presence. Lady J. Russell and Miss Rothschild were lso spectators of the proceedings in the Gaidhall, and appeared to take a very lively interest in the contest. Lady J. RusseU went repeatedly to and fro to th e Gnildhal and the committee-room in King-street, Cheapside, leaning on the arm of one of the noble lord's principal supporters. An apprehension had been entertained that the voters of the Jewish persuslon, who form a considerable portion of the constituenoy, would be precluded by their religious tenets from exercising 'heir franchise on their Sabbath; but thl3 fear proved to be wholly groundless. The Jewish Rabbis regard such an "exercise of a public right * er the performance of a public duty " as perfectly
compatible with obedience to the Divine command. Mr. Alderman Slomons set an example of freedom of sction in this zeapeut by plumping at an early hour for Lord John Russel. Indeed, the worthy alderman canvassed for plumpers for Lord J. RusseU all day.
The state of the poU up to 11 o'clock ipublished at the committeeroom of the four candidates, was as follows
Rothschild ... .. ... ... 2,700 Duke ... ... ... ... ... 2,692 - Crawford ... ... - ... . ... 2,402
COrrie2 ... ... ... ... 032 Runsell ... ... ..-. 2,789
The figures issued by Lord J. Russell's committee were still maore favourable to the noble lord; and at this poiat in the contest the "oldstagers" confidently predicted the rejec. tion of Mr. Carrie, and regarded the day as virtually decided.
The voting at the Guil&dhLU presented some anomnalous features, Lord J. Russell received a number of Tory votes; split votes wero given between the noble lord and 3fr. Carrie, his strongest avowed opponent; while others, who divided their votes between Lord John and three of his competitors eliminated the name of Baron Rtothschld from their "ticket." At the Portsoken and Houndsditch district, which may be denominat ed the Jewish quarter of London from the large number of that persuasion who inhabit it, the poUing also exhibited a phase or two worthy of notice. Very few votes were polled there until he eLoese of the morning service at the synagogues, but that few were pretty equaUy divided between Baron Rothschild and Lord . Russell, there being, however, a slight preponderance in favour of the former; but as the day wore on the disparity against Lord John became very striking, as in the two hours between 11 and I o'clock only 32 polled in his favour, while s smany as 156 polledfor the Baron. The solution of a state of things so different from what prevailed at aU the other districts was that large numbers of the Jewish Yoters, anxious not only to return the Baron, but to return him at the head of the poll, " plumped" in his favour, in order to check the advance of his rivals. This course gave umbrage to the more ardent partisans of the other candidates, who talked of retaliating by also plumping for their favourites. This threat, we believe, was not however put into execution to any appreciable extent. As the hour for closing the poU drew near the bustle and excitement at the respective committee-rooms reached their climax. Crowds flocked round the doors and windows to read each succesive anmouicneraent of the numboers, and the candidates and their imnaediate friends bsd great diffculty in elbowring their way to obtain ingress and egress,
There were Icousiderable discrepancies between the numbers put forth by the. two committees. The final numbers given hy the committee of "the four Liberal and Commer-Cstl candidates" are *-.
*- Duke . .....,- 7552
Rothschild ... ... ... .. 7,123 r Russel .. ... .;. ... ... 7,043
! Cra..ford ... 6,429 Currie .. .. .... . 5,040
At 4 o'clock a large concourse had collected both within end outside of the Guildhall, snd the successful candidates, with the exception of Baron Rothschild. were present at the closing of the poll. Lady John Russel and one of her sons also witnessed this part of the proceedings. Vociferous calls were made for Lord J. Russell, and amid the impatience of the assemblage
Mr. Barker, the crier, Ftood forward to give notice to the citizens that their attendance would be required on Monday, at 1 o'clock, when the result of the pol would be officialy declared.
The cals for Lord J. Russell were then vehemenAtly renewed, it answer to which,
The noble LoRD presented himself to the meeting, -which was the signal for deafening and prolonged cheering, accompapiedby the waving of hats. He said :-Gentlemen, you are nO doubt awre that the time for your memnbers to return tbanks will be at the declaration on Monday * and, as Baron Lionel de Rothschild is not here, I should be very unwilling to made a speech now in his absence. (Cheers, and "Co on.') Still, gentlemen, as we have a pretty good guess what the result of the polling has been, let sue repeat to yon wbat has been remarked to me in the course of the struggle to-day, that this really is a " soldiers' victory" (cheers)-tbat it is the people's battle; for the people have won it and no one else. (Lobd cheers.)
Sir J. DuxE next came forward and said,-Gentlemen, at present my heart is too full to thank you, but I shall endeavouron Monday to express to you my gratitude for the distinguished position in which you have placed me. (Loud c'heers.
Mr. &AwFToD then said,-Gentlemen, it only remains for me-the last, but not the least, of the successful candidates present (laughter)-to thank you very heartily for the kindness you have done me. (Cheers.)
A brief pause ensued, after which thero was a cry for "Rothschild," followed by another of "He is uot here," and still another of 1' Then send for him." Atlen&th,
Mr. Deputy HOLT said that by some accident his friend the Baron was tot there inproprid persond4 but ho trested they would receive from him, as the Baron's deputy (laughter and cheers), hits grateful acknowledgments for the honour they had conferred upon him, an-d which he took aq t proof of their unswerving fidelity to the great cause which the noble lord who had just addressed them would carry through-viL, that of civil and religious liberty. (Cheers, and a derisive cry of " Currie," in answer to which the worthy deputy interpolated a pithy parenthesis.) After , few more words, which elicited a similar interruption. followed by the same abrupt comment, the speaker -withdrew, amid roars of laughter and cheers.
The assemblage then dispersed, and on leaving the hall Lord and Lady J. Russell were greeted with enthusiastic shouts by the concourse outside.
FILNSBURY.
The poll cominenced with great spirit on Saturday morn. Ing, and until 11 o'clock Mr. Duncombe cad Mr. Serjeant 2arry were at the head of the poll; but from that time Mr. Cox began to gain upon the latter gentleman, and by the decisive and final hour of 4 o'clock he triumphed over Mr. 8erieant Parry by 234 votes. hMajor Reed starteD lauguidly, and was last in the race throughout the wvhole of the day by a long distance. The final state of the poll was as follows:-

After the close of the poll Mr Cox briefly returned thanke to a large body of the electors assembled in front of his central comnittee-rooms, at the Angel Inn, Is2ington, and promised to fulfil faithfully and fearlessly all the pledges which be had given at the hustings.
Tbe final state of the po21 will be officialy declared at the hustings in Clerkenwell-green, at 1 o'clock to-day.

SOlUTHWARK.
The nomination for this borough took place on Saturday, under the presidency of Mr. Pritchard, the High Bailiff, to whose excellent arrangements it is dae that, notwithstand. ing the enormous crowd, no practical inconvenience was ecperienced by any one who had duties to discharge at the
454tion _hseaocommodation afforded tetie pXOsawsna.- exceptionable.
The sal preliminaries havlng been gone through,
The HoGss BAFFyr briefly addressed the electors. He *ated that they had aTwaii eUla d itli 4nt blio sphit upon these ocoasons, and he asked them to consider well before exero "i hieir Choice of A persontto represent them. He urged upon them that they should give * patient hearing to every one who had-to sddress tbem, and, having done so, that they should exercise -feely and independently the suffrage which the constitution place intheiT hands.
Mfr. PocoCK nominated, and Pr. fAR=rxeconded, 3fr. Pellatt as a fit and ptdper person to represent the borough; Mr. Onus goG pZOpoed, and Mr. VIoRZRS secon ed, Sir C. Napier; and Mr. LocKE was proposed by Dr. CzsrA.rre, and seconded by Mr. WALKzm.
Mr. Pm.z TT theTpresebted hinself, but'he experienoed a very rough reception from the crowd, who refused to listen to a syllaoble that he had to say. Constantl interrupted by such exclamatirns as"How about the British Bank ?' "Who was laughed at in the House of Commons ?" "Who putbut tbe gas rand so on, he was understood to say, as nearly as we could gather his remarks, that he appeared before the electors, as their late representative in Parliament, to ask them for a eewal of their confidence. (Uproar.) eo reherred them to his acts and his votes in Parliamaent, which were matters of hisBtory, to prove that the pledges which he had itade in 1852 were genuine, ond that those pledges hid been fully realized in Parliament by his speeches and votes. (Cheers and uproar.) His conduct was before them, and during the hsetfve yearshe hadreceived such frequent testimonials of approbation at their hands that he could not believe that tet qwould desert him now. They were aware that his principles extended to Radical reform; that he was an advocate-for the ballot, for household suffrage, for abolition of church-rat;e, and for a general system, of religious education. ITot only were theso his opinions, but he ha4blso criginated many acts of reform in Parhlament. He had always been an advocate for placing the poor-rate on a fairer and more equitable basis, by an euiation and by enlarging the area of rating, so as to aMter the obnoxious system of the- present Poor-Lw settlement. Should he have the bonour of again being returned for that borough he should be prepared to press these matters upoD the Government, as well as meares for reform in the army and navy. He had always been the advocate of measurea which he believed had tended to the proeress of civilization. He wasin every sense, he believed, the ?riendof the people; and he had ever mnade it his great object and aim to endeavour -by every means poesible to reduce crime by the power of education:-- He held it to be the duty of the, electors to choose as their representatives men who had these objects atheart -and he -would take the liberty of askng whether past services were to go for nothing ? (Cheers.) He had been before them many years, his character was known, he had represented them in Parliament for five years, and he felt that he had served them honestly, faithfull, and consistently. (Cheers and uproar,) He was quite willing to retire into private life if bis friends wvould have allowd him to do so; but, after the requisions which he had received, so numerously sigraed, urging him again to take his position as their representative in Parliament, he had felt ite-his duty to respond to the request of his former constituents, e trusted that the principles of civil and religious liberty had not suffered under his advocacy; Rebelievedth he had the sympathies of the working classes. (Cheers and "Nol Nol") After he had succeeded in removng some obnoxious clauses from the NuiancesRemoval Bill nearlv 3,000 of the worldng men of that borough presented him with a-written testimonial of their approbation, and he was not aware that he had done anything since to forfeit their confidence. (Cheers. H e stood before them asthe chazmpion of civil and re"ygious liberty, anxious at al tines to advance the best interest of our great and-glorioc t couotry, and to strengthen and conolidate the seay of our excellient and belored Queen. (Cheers.) After expressing his confident assurance that he should again be returned as their representative tr. Pehatt retred, amid the cheer of his friends and counteor demon strahions from hs opponents.
Sir of Nt"rrn, who wore the riband and ollar of the Bath and numeroxpforeignh decorations, was received with much ppLause, and.wae patientAydlistened to throughout.
eHo commenced by stating that from the oatset be had formed the determination not to say a diseourteous word of either of the other candidatee, a o that he had requeled a
his supporters to foelow his example e then explained the affair of the "marriage of the cards," asreportedin coutimes of Saturdayn and expressed the anoyance which the circus
stance had occasioned him. Adverting to the recen t vote in the House of Commons, lie statea thati the fame of god Palmerston had spread to the very uttermnost corners of the 'world, and that even the Emperor of Chna hiniseli uapported Lord Palmerston,- for he bad sent despatches to Commissioner Yelrentiretv disapproving his conduct, and vindicating the proceedings of our offlcers on the spot. (Cheers.) He wondered whsat the coaliti-nists thought of themselves now. The honour of the British nation had been maintained, and he thought it very likely that in the course of a week or so we shoudd receive despatches from China a-nouncing either thbat the -war -was at an end, or that Admiral Seymour was.putting an end to it with cannon baUsas fast as he poesibly could. (Cheers.) The vote which he had given upon- this subject-was in his opinion the only honest vote which he could have given; at the same time he was neither a party map, nor a thick and thin supporter of Lord Palmer3tons. When he.thougbt that his Lordship was wrong-and he was sorry to say that he was very often wrong-he gave him his earty opposition, just s he gave him his hearty support when he-thought that he was right. (Cheers.) Thore was no 4oubt that Lord Palmerston would be greatly supported by the country; but when he came back to Parliament it would be the duty of the Liberal members to press measures of reform upon him, and to demand that
e hould da full -justice-to the people. He regrettedvarv muchthatLord Falmerstonhad voted waist Er,ocke; as motion for asimlating the county and borough franchises, but that measure, at all events, maust be extorted from bimn at the next election. The ballot also must be granted; there mnust be an -increaeo of the suffrage, at least to the extent of household suffrage, and with these points gained, reform mst rapidly- advance. (Chees) Church-rates must be abolished and religious freedom must become such a reality that Jeows,hould. be admitted into Parliament. (Cheers.) In conclusion, he tendered his warmest thanks to the electors and non-electors for the support which they had given him. He had- canvaed other places before, but never in his life had he received 8uch kindness, cvility, and attention as he bad met with from the men of Southwirk. His canvaeshad been mostguccessfl], and be could not dotbt for a maoment that if all those who had promised him support went to the poll he -should be triumaphantly returned as their representative. (Loud cheers.)
Mr. LOCBe said that he appeared before ther for the first time as a candidate, in c6isequbnce of a vote of the House of Commons, which had made it imperative on Her Majesty's -Ministers to dissolve Parliament. Agreeing as he did awith the foreign policy of Lord Palmerston, because.he believed it to be a peace policy, ho thought the electors of Sonthwark should nave an opportunity of expressing their opinion on the subject, At the same time he was not an indiscriminate supporter of Lord Palmerston. He was for a much greater extensiosi of the stffrage than anything that had hitherto been proposed by the noble lord, but Lord Palmerston had declared himself in favour of progressive improvement, and Lord Granville had stated that the Government would have supported lr. Locke Kinp's Bill had it been a practicable measure. (Cheers.) He (Mr Locke was, therefore, in favourof alge extension of the suffrage-every man -who had a house should have a vote. (Cheers.) Thus conferring the vote-upon-the humbler classes, he was, as a natural sequence, for the rotection of the ballot, and for a shorter duration of ParCiamenta-three years instead of seven-which was not a principle of destructiveness, but a simple reversion to the ancient constitution of the realm. Scarcely a sentiment had been expressed by Sir C. Napier in which he did not perfectly coincdde. The libeal views which the gallant- admiral had uttered were precisely these which he himself entertained, and that which, of all others, recomamended itself most to kis consideration was that which tended to abolish all distiactions between persons of different religious creeds, and enabled every man to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience. Reverting to the question of the suffrage, he stated that he would, while conferring that privilege upon the working classes, remove the trammels which at present surrounded the exercise of it, and he would therefore dispense with the rate-paying clauses of the Reform Act. (Cheers.) He was opposed to the income-tax, because he was persuaded that it could never be fairly levied, and be. cause, being a war tax, he thonght that it should be got rid of as speedily as possible. Altbough he came before theru as a candidato for the first time, he was connected with the borough both by social position and property. His father had long carried on business within it, and he bad there obtainedthat competency which had made him, in every sense of the term, " independent," and capable of becoming their representative. A subject which had been renresnted to him by thousands of the industrious classes haa relation to free_emigration. He had long considered that in an
empire like ours, on which the sun never set, it was desirable if a mAn could not obtain his living in his own immediate neighbourhood that he should be enabled to travel to those
distant regions under the sway of Her Majesty where he might obtain for himself a competency and a fortune.
(Chleers.) On the subject of educations ho expressed his regret at the numerous failures which had been experienced in the House of Commons, owimg to the sectarian views of
its different promoters. In order to advance education it was necessary to commence at the right end; whereas or pseudo-philanthropists lavished all their care and attention
upon persons who had committed crime, and neglected
gother the industrious pOOr. He wished that there were a universal plan of education adoPted throughout the* country which would infuse happiness among the people, and would the better Jit them for the exercise of the franchise. In conclusion he stated that he had been received with the utmost cordiality by the working men of that large borough, and he was satisfied that he had their confidence, because they believed him to be an honest man. (Cheers.) He hadmopurpose of his own to serve in Parliament. He should go there unfettered and independent both in property and in thought, and the only ambition which he had was to represent iii the great chamber of - the --nation that constituencxy whose opinions he believed that he faithfully reflected. (Q(hers.) He should appeal- to the-poll oh Monday with the mof* perfect confidence, and he reiterated the expression of WizWntir freedom and independence.
In.answer to Mr. Haynes, an elector,
MIr. Losc stated that-he wouldopen the British Museum and National Gallery on Sunday, but not the Crystal Palace, or any ordinary place of4amusement.
A show of hands was then taken, whon an immense majority was exhibited ia favour of Sir C. Napier and Mr.1 Locke, and the election was accordingly declaredoti have
fallen upon them. A poll, however, was demanded on behalf of MIr. Pdllptt, anld it wvas appointed to take place
A vote of thanks to the High Bailiff and to Mfr. H. D.
pl.edged to gneral support of Lord Paberston, with whomn theJ oted in opposition to the Cobdea -4ina motion which caused the diasolution. Tho threo candidates are all Liverpool merchants.
1KiIHURST.
The cleciion for this borough took plac on Saturday.
Mr. JOIN STOVEXD proposed, and 3Ir. P. DN2iTrr seconded, Mr. Samnucl Warren.
No other candidate being proposed,
The RVEU5NING OFrICER declared Mr. Warren duly elected.
MIr. WARREN addressed the electors, and, after thanking them for the honour t hey had just conferred upon hire, proceeded to refer to the China questlon, and vindicated the vote he had given in favour of Hz. Cobden's motion. Alluding to general politics, he expressed himself ready to snpport any measures tending to a reduction of expenditure which would leave the safety and honour of the country unimpaired. He would also support any national scheme of education which was based on the principle of religious instruction, thou2h he would fetter none in professing any mode of faith. He was not in favour of either Parliamentary reform or general extension of the suffrage, both of which measures he con. sidered would destroy the balance of power in the constitutlon, though he would not object to a temperate and wellconsidered extension of the franchise to en r of integdty, independence, and intelliRence. He would vote against the grant to Maynooth, which he considered was altogether at variance with the Protestant principles of the State, and he would vote against the admission of Jews to Parliament.
DOVER.

Osborne ... ... ... ... ... 989 Russell. ... ... ... ... 95
Clerk... ... ... ... ... 695 Hope .. .. .. .. .. ..57 The official declaration having been made,
Mr. B. OSBORNE said that, after victory, nothing so much became a man as moderation in his triumph, He was, in thefirstplace, boundto return his sincereandlheartfelt thanks to those freemen and electors who, uninvited, and also un. Battered by him, had placed him in the proud position which he then occupied, and then, perhaps, he might be allowed to address a few words to his late opponents, and that was to say that for the candidates vho had been opposedto him he had long felt nothing but respect, and, in one instance, friendship. (Hear, hear.) He hoped that during the contest he had made no enemies. If he had it would be odd, for if it was the part of Joe hillIer to raise a smile the arrows that shot from that bow had no barb. ( " Hear," and laughter.) Those gentlemen who had been so constant from first to last in opposing him-be meant the melodious gentlemen below (a laugh)-would find tbat he had an ear to listen even to their complaints, and a heart not deaf to any claim that might be made, and as long as he possessed the energy and spirit he at present did possess he should nevor tire in Speaking of their cause.
Sir w. RuessLL also returned thanks.
After some observations from Sir G. CLXRK and Mr. Hos'E,
A vote of thanks to the Mayor, moved and seconded by the unsuccessful candidates, vas carried by acclamation ad, his worship having acknowledged the compliment, the proceedings terminated.

cation, revision of the church-rates, and the eclesiastical courts. He held that, before it was proved that the British authorities in China had done what was intentionally wrong, it was the duty of the country to uphold their public servants, and to suppose they had acted from pure motives. Re hoped, therefore, the nation would not condemn. unheard, those in a distant part of the world. When he understood what the real question was-not the Chinese war, but the overthrow of a Liberal Government, to be replaced by the retrograde party, the Tories-he had voted against Mr. Cobden's motion. He would support Lord Palmerston upon the understanding that he proved himself to be the faithful leader of the Iaberal party.

Mr. W. B. Hughes, of Plas-coch, Conservative in principles, was returned on Friday, unopposed, for the Carnarvonshire boroughs.
OLDHAM.
The nomination of candidates for this borough took place on Saturday.
Mr. CoBBETr said, that he had done his utmost ever since his election in 1852 to promote efficient legislation with regard to factory labour, and for the education and ad. vancement of the working classes generally. The news of the collision with China took the Government completely
by surprise, and he could not help admiring, as well as supporting, Lord Palmerston's resolution to stand by Sir J Bowring, and he hoped that the result of this election would be a demonstration to despots that the British flag was not to be trifled with. (Loud cbeers.)
Mr. W. J. Fox said, that the elections had been repre. sented as turning on a single vote, being for the purpose merely of sanctioning or rebuking Mr. Cobden's motion,
So great was the embarassment thus produced that 1%e Tinma did not know how to classify the elections, for the
old terms of Whig, Tory, Conservative, or Liberal, wonld no longer answer, and the journalist was driven to use the terms " Ministerlallat" or " Oppositionist," as the
case might be. (" Hear, hear " and laughter.) What vwas a Ministerialist, and what an Oppositionist? It wonld be difficult for the shrewdest elector to make up his mind on that question. (Applause,) Now, Lord Palmerston ought to be made to feel that it was the House of Commons he mnst consult even when his oper-
tions related to peace or var-a thing which he was not much prone to do. He admired Lord Palmerston as a war Minister; but he should like to know a little more what he ws as a peace Minister, and see a programme of his home policy. AN regarded the China question, Lord Palmerston spoke of Commissioner Yeh as "an insolent barbarian,"
but if there was barbarism on one side there was Billingsgate on the otber. (Cheers.) As to the conduct of the Vhinese Commissoner, Lord Palmerston put the ca-t before the horse, because Yeh's atrocities at Canton were committed after the bombardment; his measures did not accord with our notions of warfare, oertainly, but they were the defence of the cowardly and weak against the mighty and overbear. ing. This election was peculiar In being confined to one pomt, and it was the business of the electors not to confine it, but to extend it, If returned to Parliament again, he should continue to advocate Parliamentary reform, for from it we should get administrative reform, andin the same way we should get both army and navy reform. He should con-
tinue to advocate full and equal religious liberty, the hboli. tion of church-rates, and the general disendowment of all ecclesiastical institutions In Ireland; and he should assist every reasonable effort to revlse and reduce our taxation.
3Mr. J. PLATT declAred himself a suPPOrter of the great princple of local self-government. He WAS anxious for
popular education, and was in favour of the widest extension of the franchise, vote by bahllot, shorter Parliaments, and equitable redistribution of electoral power.
The show of hands was in favour of Mr. Cobbett bv a large majority; there was SO a large number for M fr. Fe;x and a small show for Mr. Platt.
A poll was demanded for M r. Platt, which will take place on Monday.

pseatest sational bleing, but as to the node there was a very gioat difference of opinion. Government was lfaclined to raise the qualifications of the teachers by establishing a umore uniform system tbroughoutthe country. Withregardto the extension of the francese, it 'was sated that the head of the Goyernment was the kead of finality. He stood there to give explicit deoial to that, and he referred to the part he took In regard to Mr. Locke King's motions and to the opinion that the Premier had expressed, that a snan who "was willing and capable of servig as a juror might safely
uitrusted with the privileges of the franchise. Mr. Locke Sing's Bill havingbeen broughtin,itouldonlyhbe amended by striksing out its preamble and substituting for it a new Bill. Ee concluded by-hoping that the new Parliament *,'asl;} discharge itsduties to the satisfaction of the country.
A vote of thanks was then given to the Mayor, and the' proceedin,gs termpinated.
- ' OXFORD CITY.
The nomination took place on Saturday.
Wr. Alderman SADLER proposed Mr. James lisaughton Lamgston as a fit and proper person to renresent the city.
The nomination vwas seconded by Mr. Alderman
L3fr. J. PnKs, late mayor, proposed, and Mr. Alderman R. J. Srrms seconded, the Right Hon. Edward Cardwell.
. Mr. Sheriff SPIEBs proposed, and Mr. DoBBE, towncouncillor, seconded, Mr. C. Neate, M.A., Fellow of Oriel College.
Mr. T. NORTH, gentleman, proposed, and Mr. J. HIGoNs, jun., publican, seconded, Mr. Serjeant Gaseleo.
. Idr. LACisTON, after expressing his approval of the conduct of-Lord Palmuerston on the China question, said with regard to Mr. Locke King's motion for the extension to counties of the 101. franchis he had given it his support. 'With regard to church-rates, he had ever given his support to thir abolition whenever that subject was brought before Parliament. Respectiog the ballot, he had always supported, and would continue to support, that measure. (Loud cheers.) It vas a very necessary measure, for instances of intimidation had often come to his knowledge. Had the ballot been in operation years before he should have been retured for the borough of Woodstock, where he first commenced his political caree. It was a fortunate circumstance for him that the ballot was not then in operation, or he would not have had the honour of representing for so many years thfity of Oxford. Hlewaa entirel7 opposed to universal 4suge, hut w a an advocite forrationalprogress.
Mr. CARDWXLL then came forwardto explain his views. 'With Mbr. Locke EKing )te had voted in favour of reform. With the Government he voted on the Budget for the reroission of the taxes. With regard to the Cha question he defended his vote against the Government, and said that if bur foreign plenipotentiaries 'were to take into their own hands the Queen's prerogative of peace and war, and embark in hostilities it would notbe possible to diminish those taxes which prsased so heavily ucon the people. He did not condemn Sir J. Bowring, and dd not scek to cast censure upon him, and had that course of proceedings hich Was subsequently adopted been announced before that voto was talken it would have been neither his intention nor desiDe to cast ny censuro upon him. Tkerighthon. gentleman then proceeded to declare himself opposed to the ballot, 'which he believed was rendered quite unnecessary by the Bribery and Corruption Bill, and also to triennial Parlianents. He had twice voted in favour of the Bill for the abolition of church-rates. In conclusion he stated that he had been a party to no combination, express or implied. He had given a general support to the Ministry, and adhered to and intended to adhere to, the three watchwords of the Liberal party, non-intervention, economy, and reform. (Cheera)
Mr. N}XTR said that Mr. Cardwell supported Lord Palnmerston on the Tory side, while he himself did so on the popular eide. What he wished was to impose on Lord Palmerston a sense of popular obligation, to bind him to the psople,to makehin interest himself moredeeplyin thecause of the people and the popular progress. Forhisownpart, he had been converted to the principle of the ballot, and, as regarded free trade, he had been a free trade 'before Sir B. Peel. The contest was one between Mr. Cardwell and himself, and if he should be returned against an opponent so distinguished, and in sight of difaculties so unuan and unexpected, he should hold a posttion proud and influential, not by reason of his own ability, but because he should be as much as any other member in that House the representative of the popular choice-a position fairly and honestly obtained. (Cheers.)
Mr. Serjeant GASELE expressed his approval of the conduct of the Government with respect to the Chinese question, and contended that on the occasion which had led to the dissolution Mr. Cardwelr's vote was a factious one. With respect to the extension of the suffrage, he was not only a supporter of Mr. Locke King's proposition for a 101. fran. chipe in the counties, hut he would also propose an extension of the city and borough franchise. He was not prepared to vote for uitverssl safrage, but he was in favour of an extension of the borough franchise, and he saw no reason why they should not adopt the municipal franchise. (Cheers.) He would also extend the suffrage to lodgers under certain limited restrictions. He did not view the Corrupt Practices at Elections Bill with the same favour as Mr. Cardwell did, and was in favour of triennial Parliaments. With regard to the abolition of cburch-rates he agreed with MrT. CardwelL He was a friend of civil and religious liberty; he 'was in favour of the admission of the Jews into Parliament, and for the extension offreedom to all religions, and, whether as regarded the Churchman or Dissenter, he should always be found to .vote in favour of the moral, religiour, and social improvement of the people. (Cheers.) After advocating law reform and condemning the game laws, the learned Serjeant said that he wished to go to ]?arliament as an independent member. He would give no vote v'hich Ie was not prepared to justify, and he should be 'willing to visit them, if they desired it, at the end of every session for the purpose of giving them an account of his stewardship. He should - g ve a conscientious support to L,ord Palmerston, unless he took a much less libe-ral course than he had hitherto done. ln conclusion, r. Gaselee said ho should ebe an unflinching supporter of the rights and privileges of the city against the encrcacbments of the University, he would share in their festivities, contribute to their charities, and advance the education of the poor, believing that by so doing ho should be best promoting the social, moral, and political condition of the people. (Loud cheers.)
The Mayor then took a show of hands, which he declared was in favour of Mfr. Langeton and My. Neato. A poll was therefore demanded by the other candidates, which was fixed for Monday next.
RADNOR BOROUGHS
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER,
The election for the Radnor boroughs took place on Saturday at New Radnor. The only candidate was the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Right Hon. Sir G. C. Lwis. The right hon. gentleman, who was accompanied by the Lady T eresa Lewis, was drawn into the town in his carriage by. the populace, and was enthusiaicaly applauded.
M. R. Gaixa, of Knighton, proposed, and Mr. J. A.
PIaLLiPs, of Presteign, seconded the nomination of the; ringthon. baronet, who was declared duly elected by the returning ooffier.
Sir G. C. Lwrns then addressed the electors, and, aiter touching upon some topics of a local rather than genotral {interest, said :-It has been imputed to Lord Palmerston'a Government, or rather to Lord Palmerston specoially, that he is a lover of war, and that he is favourable to a turbulent and aggressive foreign policy. Nevertheless, Lord Paltnerston being called to the helm at a moment when the war was raging, in no long time, by the success of our arms and by the suocess of our diplomatio negotiations, we were enabled to bring that war to an honourable and safe conclusion Now, if you consider the length of time which former wars of that magnitude have lasted, you must, I think, admit that it required no ordinary effort on the part of the Government whether in the condact of the war or of the negotiations, to bring it to an honourable issue within so short a time(Hear, hoar.) Upon the return of peace we were caUed aupon as soon as we could to retrench the expenditure which the war had occasioned, and to adapt our position to our altered circumstances. Now, can it be said that the Go'vernment has been slow to recognize that change? (Hear, hear.) Mfr. Disraeli, the leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons, in his late election address-which may, I suppose, be considered as one of thu principal manifestoes of his party-remarks upon the policy of the pre3ent Government with respect to the change of expenditure and taxation resulting on the transition from war to peace, and he sys,-"Lord Palmerston is an eminent man, who has deserved woll of the country." Well, that may be considered as a staterent of some importance, coming from such a quarter (laughter); but then the praise Mr.Disraeli bestows is somewhat quaified in the remainder of the sentence, for he goes onthas -"But as Prime Minister, he occupies a false position; he is the'Tory chief of a Radical Cabinet." (" Oh, oh" 1) These flowers of eloctioneering eloquence aro not, I su pse, to be subjected to any severe eoiticism; but, prbaps, lsmay h peruitted to remark that, in the event of
.Disraeli hiraf forming an Administration, he would probably prefer to be the Radical chief of a Taory Cabinet. ILaughter.) Well, then MIr. Disraeli proceeds,-
'With no domestic polcy, he (Lord Palmerston) is obliged to divert the attention of the people from the consideration of their own affairs to the distraction of foreign politics. His external system isturbulent andag-
gresAsve toat his rule ae bome may be tranquil and un
sailed. Hence arise excessive expenditure, heavy taxation, aDd the stoppage of all social improvement." (" Oh, oh l" andlaughter.) ThisisMr. Disraeli's description of the pre. sent ptate of public aTairs. He then adds, "The general policy which I 'would enforce at this juncture may be con. tained-in these words-honourable peace, reduced taxation, ,and social improvement." Now, with regard to the
"honourable peae," I have already offered some remarks apon the subject, and need not return to it. But the right hon. gentleman says that the result of Lord Palmerston's Goverment is, *'excessive expenditue and heavy taxation," and the substitute which he proposes is "reduced taxation and social improvement." Nowv 'whateI 'would
tmdertake to show is that excewsaive expenditure and heavy
expenditure have not been the policy of Lord Palmer. ston's Government, but, on the contrary, that it has been diminished expenditure and redued taxation. (Appause.) The only way to acertain the facts of the case is to compare our'present expenditure and taxation with what they 'ere during war, . The estimates for the army and nav for
d all purpt.ye of war, which were presented at the begin.
ning oflast sesion (1856-57), 'were 56,865,0001. Tose * estimates were made upon the ssunmption that the war ' would continue, hut happily we signed a peace about Easter. The Government loet no time in revising the war *stimates, and In producing reduced estimates, adapted, as fa as possible to the nOw state of pee. Itecarcelnees sey that Irsbould remind you that the enormou establish.

once a considerable reduction. NTow, these were estimates for a year not actually of war, but- a year in which many of the expenses incident to the war had to be borne,. and as3 compared withx the preceding yearc a saaing of 17,000.0o01
was effected. (Hear, hear.) But then, you will say,.. -%hat iyour calculation for the year commencicor th s f April niext? Exclusive of the Coastgaara antd packetis, which are. not- for military purposes, the estimates for t'he year 1857-8 have been re. ducea to 18,870,0001. as compared with. 38,000,0001. In the preceding year. Now, these are -positive facts, abouxt which nq doubt canx exist, because they ret on papers preE-ented to Parliament. I asik, therefore, whether it cau be said that excesive expenditure, tried by the test Df a great reduoction of expenditure, has been the policy of the present Government? (Hear, hear.) But, then we are told that " reduction of taxation!' is the policy which Mr. Disraeli recommends, as contrasted with the policy of Lord Palmerston's Government, whichl one must pregume is that of increased taxation. Well, now, what are thLe facts? The incomne.ax-no small part of our resourcesbas been reduced from 16d. to 7d. in the pound. and other reductions of taxation have takcen place, partly -in consaquenes of propositions of the Government, and partly by the operation of prospective provisions in statutes; and for the year 1857-58, as compared with the year 1855.56, there has been a reduction of niearly 11,500,0001. (Cheers.) I think, tberefore, I have proved by figures, which admit of nao doubt, that "1excessive expenditure and increased taxation" are niot the policy of the present Governmnent. (Esear, hear.) I may perhaps mention, as showing the extent to which the expenditure has been reduced in the present year, since the charges attendant upon the transition topewc were defrayed, thait the actual diminution in the present nuerter (fromn January to the first of April) is about 6,0,01 as compared with the correspondi:ng guarter of theprevioas year, -which was not a period of active war,-that is to say, snore than 2,000,0001. in each month-ra+her maore than 500,0001. a-week, and very niearly 100.600. per day. (Cheers.) These facts must, I think, convince you that Government have reslutely put their shoulders to the wheel for the purpose of effecting reductions in the military and naval expenditure of the country. (Hear, hear.) The 'right bon. gentlemaan proceeded to show the practical difficulty of at once reducing establishment-s framed on a war basis, contrating it with the easy work of writing on paprs reduction from .30,000,0001. to 20,00,00. o 1,00,001. ad then continued :-With re~rd o te crcustacethat led immedilately to thi unxpeteddisoluionof Parliament-the vote upon theChies quston-t s popr tatI shouid make some remalisupo it asit i h usino which the appeal has eenmad tothe ounry.Thehon. gentleman who did me the honour of prpsng e very clearly pointed out the peculiar position of our agents in China, separated by imany thousands of mniles and many weeks of posta communiication from England,-a few Englishmen surroundedl by an enormous and, it may be, a hostile people, and he has shown that under such circumstances it is not wise, It is -not pruadent, it is -not fair, it is hardlv decent, I may, say,
for the Government to scrutinize with' la ealous and hostile, criticism all the acts of their subordinates, if they act with perfect goodl faith, and when there is no imputation upon their honesty, or upon their desire to serve their country. Now, our agenits in -China have not been charged with rapacity, withi any desire to enirich themselves at the expenise of foreig cutries no f seeking to aggrandize their country by taking trrtoyrm foreigners. No, the most that can be s&ai is that, from an excess of zeal, Sir J. Bowring somnewhat erredl in asserting the rights of his country, believIn
that a treaty, had been -violated ; and I say that the. Government whichi should be over-hast,y and over-disposedl to censure their subordinates would justly excite the dis-approbation of the country. (Cheers.) I am net call'ed upon to maintain that Sir John Bowring's conduct was faultlests and' immaculate ; it is not necessary for me to show that his judgmnent and that of M1r. Consu lParkes was the most perfect and the wisest that could have been exercised under.theceireumstances. What the Government, bave toconsider in such a case is, whether their agents acted to the beet of their judgmnent and with a-reasonable discretion. Well, now let us see the ground upon which the Government actedlinthcase of Sir John Bowrng, 'When the news first arrived it -was impossiblie for us to know that the niext packet- might not bring intelligence that the whole moatter had been settled ; but when that packiet arrived we found that the-breachi had been- widene rather than narrowed, that fresh grounds of difference were added, that the Governor of Cantona showed a most unconciliatory s.pirit, and that the quarrel, which was Original,ly of small dimensions, threatened to assume an extensive and even an alarming character.- Under' these-circumsrtances what was the resoltutioni-of the Government? They thought it expedient to send out a person possessing ampler powers of negotiation than had been -given to Sir J. Bow. ring, -who was put -in possessi.u~of their views, and who could go out with the authority belo-ng. lug to a person proceeding directly fromn the central Government, and wbo might, by his authority and by his superior knowledge of the views of the Government, be able to direct operations on the spot, and to negotiate with the Chinese Government. Well, now it does not follow that a course not at first thought necessary should not afterwards become advisable; andI wish to show, according to the admissions of those who have taken thle most hostile view of and passedlboh severest censure upon.tbe acts bf Sir J. Bowrisg, and, of those who takce his Nart the very narrow difference hetween-those who censurean thlose upon -whom cenisure is bestowed. I hold in my hand aprinted spiech of Lord Derby, delivered in the Ilm of LoMsn the second reading of the Income-tax Bill. It. was a, speech quite as miuch addressedl to. the "1-hustinge" &an to mneetings-of this sort as to tbo.peers.and bishops-who had the honour of hear'. ing it. It was understood as a& sort of. political maanifesto addressed to the country-previous to .the electioniaud I think, therefore, in quoting froinwbat seems to be an authori7.ed version of the speech, I am onlY treating it In the manner in which it was intended to ho-used. (Hear, hear.) You Wilireniember -that the House ofXlords.aandti6fied the conduct Of the Government, anid therefore the - two Houses of Parliament came to an opposite conclusion, and that, in mhy . opinion -was a.- strong ground for apeain
totegeneral sense of the cutry. (Hear, hea.)The House i of Commons, diffring fro tbe Lords, passed a vote -a qualified and indisect vote, it is true'-hut still a, vote of censure upon the Government. And now, let -na hear what Lord Derby says upon the question.:- .
"I will venture-to say that, if instead of lHer .Mnest_*MaGeemment vindicating to Sho uttermoet the, conduct ot their agents, they bad COMe fOrward and expressed 'What I snt sur is their own honest and ulacere conviction, that, withL the best intentions, a, hrAtr- and 4111. judged step taken by the Plenipotentiary had involTed consequeuees whiab he would be thefiw &s treavt, tedc had been the atoc contemPlate ; that they could meb altogether 'wiudjiate the coars he hali pursued, but that allowance Ought to be .m ads for the-idffilculty of the parties In whichhe wee Plaoed and concludedwithauntichatlon, of their intention to do that which they havea done subsequently-to send out anothLer Pleulpotentiary, with fell tower. it not to suapereede, to oTenride the authority of that official,, and to brieag the affair to the
esi-et conlvAuio Po1sible; Iwill venture to say that that declarallou on the part cLtIre Golrmes'nt.weuldliu this and the other Hobuse hava PutaucLI td. if.,nnt to.sll disqeseon and debate, undoubtedly to an7 chance of an adverse division."
You maxy see, therefore. (continued Sir George) from Lord Derby's own words,. that the whole difference reduces itself to thig-if-the Government hod 'amiounced two days earlier the course they took. with respect to the appointment.of Lord Elgin, there wouldi not. isave been sany vote of censure. But they do not say that any Other course could have been taken thana was taken-ouly that if the arnnouncernent, bad- been mado a little earlier the diviamon wouldlbaselbeengspared. ithink, therefore, that under these circumistances.,. as the mattr ls-.uow explained, any sensible weight of censure caninot be said to rest upon Her Majesty's Governmnent. (Hear, hear.) There is one other point in. U,r. Disraeli's manifesto to which I wish to call your attention, that.in which he-.saya Lord Palmersion has diverted the attention of the people from. the considleration of their own.affairs-bhy the. distraction-.of foreir' politics Now, is it correct to say that Lord Iamest-i dverted the attention of the people from social improvement to foreign warfare ? Was it not the existhrnce of the Russian, war
which he found raging whenL he accepted the office of Prime! Minister, ana.which.in two.years-lIe brought toan honourable close-was it nLot the, existence of. that war, the un-
certainty as-. to -,its reslts,.. and..,the sufferigs of' our army, which diverted the attention of the I People froma social improverment and fixed it upon the Crimean campaign? (" Hear, hesis," and cheers.) The right hon. baronet, after allndinig.to some measures of social insprovemeut,whiol.-the GoDvernmient .had been obliaed to albandon in censequence of-the attention-of Parlia-ment being concentrated on the war-, proceedied to touch uipon the oxtension Of thle county franchise que-stion. It must not (he said) be forgottenL that the 40s. franchise gives votes to a large numberaof persons inAcountime while nlo suich franchise. exists in boroughsr. He exprmsedJrimsrelfdecidedly in favour of very considerably reducing the pressnt 501.. county franchise, hut would niot pledge himself to the exact amount of the reduction, whether to the full length of 101. or not. He thought it would not be wise to put the same restriction upon county *otersas upon borough-voters (freemen), and thus pre. venta man from voting unless hereside4lwithmdiRtance of "evem,miles. .Mr. Lockle King's, notion^ssimiated the right Of voting in counties and boroughs, the policy of whicha he doubted, and which, he observed would be introducing into counties an entirely new element,~ The law of voting could
its introduction. t (Hear, hear.) The right. hon. obaronet next alluded to the church-rate quesVion, remarking that the recent decision of the House -of Lords had'pliced the law om this subject in a position which rendered the- present state of things intolerable. While contending that the church-rate was a charge upon rent, and that its abolition wonld have the effect of at, once putting pome 30O,0001 or 400,0001. a-year into the pockets of the owners of'the soil he showed the feeling of ininstice with which it wasregarded by DiRssenterr5 and expressed his opinion that, unless those friends of the church who at present would listen to no proposal for an alteration of1the law, should assent to a reasonable settlement that would relieve the Dissenters, not many years wouldelapse before the rate would be abolisheaand the church establishment be maintained by voluntary effort. He
ad no fear that such efforb would be adequate to maintain our churches; but the burden would be likely to fall mnore beavly -upon the present and 'the liberal than upon the absent and the illiberaL. :(Resar, heaLr.) The ri;ht hon. gentleman, after a few further expressions of his thanks to the eletoprs for the honour 'xgain conterred upon him, resumed his ~4at very loudly applauded.
A vote of thanks to the retmuing offioer closed the proecedings.

excitement in the town was Intense, o`nugh 'ie ielley, there niever was an electiou in Carlise oonducted with more order and good humour on th prat of 'the electors, From the steady way in which Mr. odgsonxs 'upporters camae up to
be poll hour by hour it soon bec*me a settled conviction that Mr. Hodgson would ultimately not only bo retumned, but would be at the head of the poll, contrary to the pre. dictions of the opposite pa
The sequel proved that the strength of the Conservative element in Carlisle had not been milculated.
At 4 o'clock a large number of Mr.. Hogson's supporters drew up at his committee, room in the Royal Hotel, and a¢(.ompanied him down to the bustings, where his appearance was bailed with great enthunasm.
Sir James Graham arrived a little later than Mr. Hodgson and his party; and tho right hon. baronet was also received him much cheering, though it lacked that heartiness which distinguished it frotn the morning before.
The MAYOR claimed silence while he read the official return of the poL, And then declared Mr. William Nicholson Hodgson and Sir Jamea Grahan to be duly elected.
Mr. HODGSON then came forward amid enthusiastic cheering, and thanked the electors for the great honour they had conferred upon him.
Sir JTA.rzs GsAH wrho was received with loud And protracted cheering, said-Gentlemen, I have no cold (a laugh), my heart is warm within me,-and I only regret that my voice will not reach to the utmost bounds of this assembly, to return my thanks in that candid manner which your kindness deserves at my hands. Cheers.) Gentlemen, I did not* venturo yesterday to beast; and to-day, therefore, I shall not crow with respect to my place upon the polL But this I will say, gentlemen, that having learnt by long experience to moderate my desires, I could bear disappointment even if I had been rejected, and I find it more difficult adequately to exaress myv gratitude to you for my return on this occasion Cheers.. I have had difficulties to contend with. I regret extremely if anything I have said or done shall for one moment have created dissension among the narty with which I have long acted. But I feel that the fault has not been mine. (Hear,
hear and a voice "Qaite right.") I sincerely hope that any breach that may have been made, in that narty will henceforth be headed and for ever closed. (Loud cheers.) Though I am grateful I am somewhat sorrowful, I confeas. For, notwithstanding differences which may have arisen between me and Mr Ferguson, my late colleague, I cannot in terms sufficiently strong express my respect for his
nal character. I am certain that when we. have ciffeed he has been actuated bymotives as pure as my own (oud cheers), and for his honour, for his independence, for
his fidelity, for his generosity, and for the many excellent quslities wfhich adorn him I can answer from long experi. once. (Loud and continued cheering.) Nowr, gentlemen,
I ventured to state on a former occasion that I did not
presume for ono moment to dictate who should be my colleague in the new Parliament. Your choice in the
strongest manner, by a marked jreference, has filen upon the hon. gentleman on the other side of the hustings.
In manyr of the assurances which hehasgivenyonlcanmost cordiallyjoin. I shall certainly act writh him 'uith reference to the reduction of expDenditure, and wvith reference to the abolition of needless offices. And allow me, just in passing, to obeerve that these contests-these popular contests-re not altogether unproductive of popular benefit. When last we met here in 1852 the question was with reference to pro. tection to native industry. ("No, no," from Mr. Hodgson.) By dint of fighting protection was thrown aside, and we
all became freetraders. (A laugh.) So also, on this occa-
sion, I am happy to obaerve that wo are become Parliamentary reformers. (Loud cheers and laughter.) It .is only a question of time and of degree, and I hope that the hon. gentleman on the other aide of the hustings will be found, when the oiportunity arrives, giving effectto the extension of the franchise-that he and Ish be found inthe sanolobby giving effect to the opiniona Wthich you have unequivocaUy expressed. (Hear, hear.) With respect to yourlocal interests, without distinction of party, I shall be most happy to join
with Mr. Hodgson in doing everything in my power to promote those interests and to consult the prosperity of this city. (Loud cheers.) And before we part I must also cordially join in the wish expressed by Mr. Hodgson, that if
any angry feelings should have arisen out of this contestthey may be buried in oblivion. (Cheers,) On my part, I can truly say I have no feeling but that of gratitude-not one particle of resentment towards any gentleman in this
vast assemblage. It is perfctly right that the utmost freedom of comment should prevai on the conduct of public men. It is salutary to the utmost extreme. I can only' look forward to some future opportunity when I shall come to render an accoant of the mode in which I have dis-
charged my duties towards you, when I hope and trust, in full confidence, you will find no reason to withdraw the
conaidence you have placed in me, Gentlemen, I beg leave to ret-urn you my mnost sincere thanks for the honour which yo have conferred uponme. (Loud and prolonged cheer'
NIDDER3NSTER.
M R. LOWE.
This election terminated in a very discreditable manner as far as respects the conduct of the non-electors. The poing booths were smroundod all day by a large number of non-electors, who behaved themselves in a very unseenmly
manner, mobbing the voters as they came to the poll. Mr. Lowe Nas at the principal polling booth at Blakebrook during the greater part of the day, and took the lead on the poll from the first hour in the morning up to the close, when the numbers were-
-Right Won. . Lowe ... ... ... 234 Mr. Boycott . ... ... ... --- 146
M ajority ... ... .. ... -88
Shortly before 4 o'clock, and before the poll was finally closed, although no elector had voted in the last half-hour,
an attack was made upon Mr. Lowe and his friends by the
mob, which now consisted of between 3,000 and 4,000 persons, who, with hootings.and imprecations, threw stones and brickbats into the booth, evidently directed against Mr. Lowe and Mr. Pardoe, his proposer. The Mayor and other gentlemen made repeated efforts to calm the
mob, but ineffectually, and, the disturbance increasing, the Mayor was requested by several magistrates to read the RiotAct, which, however,lae,perhapwisely, rehfained from doing, as it would probably only have further exssoerated
the crowd, which it would have been impossible to disperse, the only force at the command of the 3Mayor being the local
police, and some 70 or 80 special constables sworn in on the previous day.
The attack becoming more serious, several persons having received severe cuts and wounds from the missiles, and it being evident that in a few minutes the mob would burst into the booth, a general rush was made out of It into the crowd, and Mr. Lowe and the MAyor were conducted towards
the town (the booth being situated in the outskirts). The
mob followed with hootings and yells, and continued their attack, throwing stones and brickbats as before, until Mr. Lowe's friends carried him into a house in Bewdley-atreet, 'which was immeiaitely surrounded by the mob and the windows smished fromntop to bottom.
It is stated that Mr. Lowe is hurt, and also his proposer,
M[r. Pardee. Several persons had their head& cut, but we have-heard of no casualty likely to be fataL When the report was despatched, however, the town was in a Most
excited state. Al'th th hops were closed between 4 and 5 o'clock, and it is stated thata telegraphic depeth had been veent off requesting the aid of'the military.
SHEFFIEMD.
The poll commenced with great energy at 8 o'clock on Saturday mornging. In the afternoon a dense crowa occupied the front of the Angel Inn (Mr. Overend's committee room), so As to maak the street ippasasble. All the shops in the street were closed, and 1a number of policemen guarded th gateway of the inn. Whenever one of the carriages of the Conservatives passed it was hooted, but when a Liberal carnrage came the crowd opened to let it psss, ahid cheered lustily; There was, however, no small danger'of mischief. Tw o carts loaded with furnace. coke and anotherwith turinps passed, and thecrowdpossessed themselves of turnips aifd coke, which they used to pelt the pooiemen. Seteral of the men were struck, but, under the
prudent direction of Inspector ,inley, they bore it quietly The space in front of the Roy2l Hott1 (Messs. Roebuck and Iadfield's committee room), extending up the Hay-
market to Dixon-lane, was crowded with a dense mmas of
people thronghout the afteroon, and- until after the los os of tha poll, when they were addressed by the successful

Remember that you, the British peoplo, are the politcal leaders of the old world, and that the fame of your victories in the cause of freedom will be responded to by your American brethren on the Transatlantic shores of the United Sates, and may even find an echo in the breast of the poor enslaved African negro, who pines away his miserable existence amid the dismal swamps. (Cheers.) Gentleonen, my pleasing duty haa terminated. I will not detain you by any further observations, beyond returning to yoU my sincerest and most hearty thanks for the honour you have done me this day.

The borough is notonously corrupt, and at the last general election Mr. Dodd was petitioned gainst on the ground of bribery and trting, and declined to defend his seat lest an adverse decsion upon the part of a committee might have' induced Parliament to send down a commission of Inquiry. On Saturday many of the publichouses were - 'open" throughout the day, and in consequence there was a great amount of drunkenness and numerous personsl collisions.

The erowd -assembiled was large in numbers and powerfol in lung but It was a*good-humoured crowdenough, and the proceedings passod off withost m.ore n61ose and Interruption than might under tbe cir tanstces hive been iooked for. Mr. Roupell, the popular and "resident" candidate, was followed to the gound by s train of-some dozen private carriageI. Among the occupanbs of these were several ladies, whoEe kerchiefs wa,vd 'kin approvt &t tfie proper moment, and who displayed greal interest in the proceedings. Mr. RoupeU Is a bachelor, and rich. -Jr. Wilkinson and his friends made their appearance onthe hustings quietly and without parade. The supporte±% of ifr: Will&ias formed a solemn procession, in the midst of *hiclE walked the hon. gen3leman fankedl)y attendant bannermen.

Wilkinson s friends, they poured in a deadly fire of "chaff." Scattered volleys in zeply told witT some eiet, and the war of words becoming generat" dire Discord" began to raise her horrid head and stalk among the crowd. "Iix'd wa the murmur and confused the sound." haid the groaus of the wounded and the shouts of thevictorsuponthiselectorsl field ofbattle,
The RxrTuR.6 Osuct (Air. IL Onslow) introduced more or less of I lovely peace" by reading the writ and bespeaking attention.
Mr. . ILLiNGTOR proposed Mr. Wliams, a gentlemxn who, notwithstanding the unworthy attempt of Tqq Ti7me to turn the electors from the real issue before them, would certaly be electedi who, though not a pliant ecurtier, was wlat to them was far better-an honest, upright, straightforward, consciesitious, true Briton; who was tobe honoured for his defence of public rights and his opposition to Governmeiit johi and"Govensment extravaganoe; and who stood before thb consftituency, not as a man who promised, but as onae who had.really don work for the people. (Cheers.) elydn
Mr. BSLvxcgs.Tz seconded the nomination not of "Viscount" Williams. (&amiring Elector.-' He is 'sweet Williams ' to us r", but of a gentleman unconnected with the aristocracy, w6 had risen from the-ranks by his o industiy, integrity;and perseverance. What was a title compared with the honours chowered upoon a ma 'by his felldw-count2jtmen? Mr.Williams had been returned for Lambeth at two contested elections, and thst was En honow which no monarch could bestow upon a subject. Cheers.)
3br. RsoDi s nonifi-ated Mr. Wilnson, who ha practically carried out the prinbiples upon which he had befor, been returned to Parliament, and had been ever ready to sustain his opinions'before the electors by manly argauent. (Cheers and interruption.)
3fr. GRAY seconded the nomination.
Mr. P. DouLroxproposedMr.W.RoupellUz aitnduroper person to represent' the borough in Farliament. Ue sup. ported that gentleman, first because he was one of thein. selves, and secondly because of his attachment to the great principRes of"refozzh. (Cheers.) He knew that at an election time it was easy to get up professions of attach, ment to a borough,'as well as an attachment to popular principles, but M\r. Roupell had, during the past l0 yoas,
ventau earnest of that interest which he would ULad in
in beh if etcitwd sib its 1preseutative.
*Mr. Gno'vs secdnlled the nomination.
Mr. WILLTmS said the electors of TAmbeth were called upon to perform the most important duty which devolved upon f&ee men, and to exercise wright which belonged to no people ih Europe but free-born Engiishmen-naniely, that of sending into the House of Commons members who would make just laws and'stand by the interestg of the people regardless of the interests of any profligte Governnent. He sled. had the honour of representing them in Parliament during ziearly seven tears; and havmne discharged his dut
likea faithful; honest man ("Oh,oh?' andochers) he felt confident they -would place him in the distinguished position of their representative in the next Parliament. There was not a man in the last Hlouse of Commons who took so much care of their pockets as he did. ("Come, thatQ pretty atrong I") He devoted more time than pretty nearly all the Hous "of Comnmons put together in exposing the profligacy of the Governaent' under which the country was now p1aced. ("Oh !") It would hardly be believed that this
Liberal" mistry required 6,000,0401. sterling more to carry on the Goveratnent than was required in the last year of peace, precedingthe Russian war, by the Governments of Lord Derby and Lord Aberdeen. J"Clap.tra 1") This was maeidence of "liberality" quite unp""4ented, and he ked the electors whether it was not necessa for them to send to Parliament a man who would op7pos such extr&vagoce, and not one who would bsak it un. Smncohe had had the honour of bein their representative not a manlin the House of Commons ad devoted more of his time, or had employed it more industriouas, in the discharge of his daties. Days and very frequently) nights had he sacrified in the protection o their interests and the Interests of the country at large and he had accomplished two financial reforms of more importance than had been accomplished by any one in tho House of Commons durin the memory o man. ("Oh!") Between 6,000,0001. ana 7,000,0001. of taxes used to be intercepted between the pockets of the taxpayer and the Treasury without any ac. count of thir uan being rendered to Parliament. For several years he had dinned this iniquity into tbe ears of Goven. ment, charging them with gross and disgraceful neglect of the public money, and little more than 12 months ago be accomplished, a6 the representative of Lambeth, this great land important object. In consequence al the txes were now paid into the Exchequer, ana not a fasthing was talken oun of the Excheqter unles by a vote of the Houseof Coin. mons. Then, for between 10 and 12 years he brought fot. ward the infNuitous injustice of imposing the legacy duty upon all descnptions of property except lands. The
ture, being landowners, took care of their own pe and for 60 gears they had acted with the gross injustife of imposing that tax upon every class in the cotamunity but themselves. He, however got the tax extended to land a short time ago, and tiis would save the pockets of other classes to the extent of 2;I000,00O a-year, which else must have been raised by duties levied on the necessaries of life, or by the income-tax. (Cheers.) With reference to this last-mentioned subject he had denounced over and over again for svveral years past the iniquity of imposing the income-tax upon tradesmen and professonal men to the same extent was imposed upon landed proprietors and upon fundholders, and if he were sent to the next House of"Comtuons he would tell the electors whathe would do-he wouldendeavourto obtain stieo for tradesmen and professional men by raaing the tax they bore one-half that which was paid by the rich classe just alluded to. (Cheers.) During the lIat session ke had tried to wipe away from the statute-book that harsh, nunjust, and oppressive portoir uf the tax imposed on incomes under
l01. a-year. HTe had been charged with bringing this forward in order to obtain votes, but he had given notice that he would submit a motion-to abolish that portionl of the tav immediately after 'the Chancellor of the Exche qer announced his intention to continue its imposition, w'fich was a considerable time before the' division on Xr. Cobdei's motion, and when; therefore, members had no expectation of a general election-_t any rats, in the course of this year, He could brixig forward a vast And long list of the servlees he had rendered, and of others which he had endeavoured to render,' for'--the good of his constituents and of the country. He would, however, only detain them by some few observations respecting the Chins q,uestion. The hon. candidate proceeded to state the circunistances Attending the recent rupture with China amid cries of "Be concise, 31r. Wlliams." "Cut it short. Having defended his vote agaitst the Ministry, he describedthe origin of the Persian war, not daunted by several interlocutors, who observed " It's been In print."' "We know all about it." Having denounced the conduct of the Government inadkng war without the consent of Parliament, 3r. Williams concluded by appealing to the electors for their support, and by declaring that what be had been in the past they would find him in the futurenamely, an honest and a faithful representative of this great borough. (Cheersm)
lfr. WIMNSONca came forwarxd, hut did not receive a very patient hearmg Five yersr ago, he said, the electors of Ubeth h easd him to the post he had until lately occupied, and had ther iolaced him atthe head of theoll. Since that time he had given above 700 votes in the Mouse of Commons. It was possible out of such a number that he might have given some-which were laot agreeable to his constitnents. On the other hand, he believed he could honestly and consneitltiesly explain every one of those votes as having been given to the best of his judgment and accoxrding to-thu dictates-of his-conscience. (Cheers.). fe
was not going to tell the electors that the Governament of I this country was a '"profligate" Government, or that there were no honest men in the House of Cown mona except himself.-- (Heat, hear.) Hi late celleague had endeavoured to explain his vote aginst the Govermnent On the China question, and told th eleotor~s that the Government of-Lord Derby would be a much more economical one than that o£ Lord Palmerstonl. He (M,.
wukjison) couML therefore understand why Mr. Wiliams had voted upon Mr. Cobden's raotion against Lord Palmerston's Administration. tLaaughter and interorption.) With respect to China, be msight inform the electors of the news just arrived, that the Chinese had come to their senses, and that the Emperor disowised the acts of his Cormmissioner. They had a right to assume, therefore, that the course taken by Sir John Bowring and Admiral Seymour was a justifiable one. FHean;) It seemed to be the wish to throw upon him the odlium of having imposed the income-tax upon them, but he need hardly tell them that he had hadno more to do with imnposing the tax than his late colleague. During the five years he had represented them he had striven to do his duty faithfully. He had given more votes and been absent fewer times than Mr. Williams, so that whatever credit was claimed by that gentleman for- assiduity and attention to Parliamentary duties belonged also tohim. (Confusio,) He saw that they weredisinclined to hearhim, and he would conclude, therefore, by appealing to them to take an unprejudiced-view of his polstical'conduct, to give him their suffrages, and to send htn back to Parliament, as he believed they would do, as their representative, (Cheers,)
Mr. ROUJPELL was enthusiastically received. He said he had no desire to thrust himself forward, had he not been loudly called upon to stand as a -local and independent can-
didate. In'tbat character accordingly he presented himself -an independent candidate seeking the anfflages of !ndependent electorsg- (Cheers.)--- He had addressed neaTly 30,000Inhabitants-of this borough with the lat few days jmdfeltgreatlyhonouredbythe enthuiasm shown in bis behalf, which he took both as a complinent to himself and as a homage to tho great princles le nrofessed. He ow'ed a deep debt of gratitude-to the borough of Imbetlh, for he could not help reeolecting that- it was hero that the exertions of those who had gone before him, and'to whom he owed.everything,-were-fast successful. He felt therefore tbat le could not devote the means he poseed to -a etter purppse than to the advancement of -the local interests :of the borough; and-that was his intention. (Cheers.) He was no place-man, no taft-hunter ; he had no' h; ambitiop than to represent his native borough inthe,Comonhs'

Mr. EWART congratulated the country on the peaoeful condition of the world. Peace was the time for increasing intercoursse between nations by the reduction of Customs duties, in which America had taken a step. From the war had come the opening up of the East to our commeroe and army refoTm. Our barracks would no longer be castfee of indolence, and we should have a small, but the best army in the world. He was in Parliament when Sir Robert Peel altered the character of the Maynooth grant, in which he howed that he did not understand the tomper of the times, which was in favour of the voluntary principle. He was opposed to the opening of the Sydenham Palace on Sunday. He would not support a Maine Itquor Law, but he would vote for inquiry into the subject The subject of education was in a state of chaos, sndhe would suggest a plan which would not interfere with the conflict between the religious and secular systems-that Government should require every child to be able to read and write before It was taken into employment, leaving its religious education to Sunday schools. He alinded to the social reforms which he had carried in Parliament. and expressed his confidence that capital punishments would yet be abolshed. He would support the Government on all well-considored social, political, and legal reforms.
lIr. HANAY sad he asked for the suffrages of the electors as a member of a family long connected with the district, He was in favour of administrative reform, but against the Administrativ1 Beform Association, which merely proposed to transfer Government from the hands of great noblemen to great merchants. lIe wished for nonitervention in foreign affairs; he did not hate war; but In an age of such commercial production and intellectual activity, peace was the natural condition; but stiU tbey mnst maintain an efficient army and navy. Ho advocated army reform, We must avoid propagating British institutions in soils unfitf for them, ana keep our sympathy for the labourers of Gloestershire in place of Italian peasants. More attention ought to be paid to home affairs: there were plenty of debates on continental revolutions, but none on strikes. He would reduce our system of ambaosadors, and devote attention to emigration, education, and simplification of the transfer of land, 1e observed from the last number of Tie 2'imes newspaper that a great many unattached men would go to Parliament-men not pledged to a name, but a policy oHe saw signs that Lord Palmerston was prepared to withdraw from foreign politics, and bead the movement for social reform, and if so ho would follow his Lordship.

The last Parliament was dead sod gone, and itmight be un'L necessary to say anything either bad or good of it, but to his opinion, before the dissolutina, it was ratber old andl worn ont-it had become deaf and blind to tbe commonestO events, and it did not fully repesent the feelngs of the people of this coumtry. However old, it wouizd be admitted, notwitbstanding, that it had dono good servioe its day. Ile begged to be allowed to enumerate some things which they had done in the cause of improvement. And first, in reference to tho taxesof this country. One great injustic was that property derived trade and oommerces hould be subjected to atax frcs Ewhich landed property was exempted. The kst Parliament had passed a measure xaDing the sucoession duty in botk case3 alike. In 1852 the taxes on new perand advertissments were in existence, impeding the progress of inteUigenee and education among the people. These two taxes had been got rid of. Wit regard to Scotland, two or three thing d been done. The tests in Univerities had boen abolisbe.
These, although apheld by a great body in the State, were felt to be a great grievance, and that was oo other good act which the late Parliament had done. Thero was a mear
which had excited some discussion in Scotland, but he was of opinion that It had. done good. He alluded to the Bill called Forbes Mackenzie!s BilL ("Oh, oh l" ana laughter.) After referring to the Administrations which had immediately preceded that of Lord Palmerston, the outbreak of the Russin war, and the energy and courage displayed by the noble viscount in bringing that struggle to a g orious and successtxl issue, the hon. memberproceeded to say thati under ali the circumstances there was nothing left to them but to ee what they could make of the present Government, and he bolieved that upon the wholo they were disposed to advance in the cause of progress ad improvement. One word, in conclusion, in reference to himself. He did not think that since ho first came among them any. body could accuse him of having concealed his opinions, and he tooktbis opportunity of again saying that he looked upon the unanimity which prevailed at this election, not oni! as an approval of his p1st conduct, but as an approbation of the principles which he professed. He could assure them that so long as he had the honourto represent them in the House of Commons he would persevere in the furtherance of those measures of reform to which he believed +he prosperity of the country was so rnuch indebted. He concluded by thanking the electorsfortheir attendance.
A vote of thanks, on the motion of the hon. member, having boen given to the sheriff, the meeting broke up.
The election of Mr. William Stirling, of Keir, for the county of Perth, took place on Saturday. The atendance at the hustings was pretty large.

PENDING ELEECTIONS.
MIDDLESEX.
Vicount CHELSEA, who has announced his intentiosof contesting this county in the Conservative interest, addressed a meeting of his supporters at Fuiham on Saturday night. Lord Ranelagh took the chair. His Lordship, vhu was very cordia31y received, addressed the meeting at sme length, defending the vote of the House of Commons on the Chinese question. Government, he considered, was mot justified in treating the decision cd the House sa a voteof censure. The dissoltiolon was a foregone conclusion to sobe the first opportunity of making an a ppeal to the conubr
wrhen they could go with a good cry to the hustings A the close of his Lordship's addres a resolution was carre
irnilmously, pnledging the meeting to give their cordial ep. port to the noble visount at the approaching election.
HERTPORDSum.-Sir H. Meux has been requestedisan address presented to him by some of the leading noblemen and gentlemen connected with the county of Hertford to withdraw from the contest. They say they cannot doulbt that his address was published under a misapprehension of the engagements entered into by himself and his two colleagues, and they earnestly hope that he will withdraw his 2adress, and that the county may not be divided upon a questiona et good faith rather than of politics, and that by one whom they have always had so much causetoesteema and respect. A mong the sinatares are those of the EArl of Ctarendon, the Eart of Rosehery, Earl Verulam, Marquis Townahend, Mr. Abel Smith, ML-. R. Hanbuxy, I&o.
LANCASHIE (SOUTPrr).-Captain Egerton, a brother of the Earl of Ellesmere, has comeforward a a candidate at the eleventh hour, and is to meet his friends at Newton-leWiUows this nmornin. Mr. W. Brown and Mr. John Cheetham offer themselves for re-election.
LixcozssExRsr (SOUTH).-The nomination is fixed for Wednesday, April 1, and not for April4, as previously stated.

MER1oNyr=ssIRE.-.No opposition to Mr. W. W. E. Wynne.
IRELAND.
CARLOw (BOROUGII).-Mr. R. Welch, rather than split the Liberal itterest, has resigned, and the only candidates now are Captain Arthur Ponsonby and Mr. J. Alexander, the late Derbyite member.
CARLOW (COUNrTY).-The two Tories Mr. Bunbury and MIr. Henry Bruen, are not to be permitted to walk over. The Hon. Frederick Poneonby has announced his intention of contesting the county on Liberal principles, and hasresolved to go to a poU.
CAVAtir (COUy'rY).-The Hon. Colonel Maxwell's return is considered quite safe. The struggle, it is thoughbt, wil lie betwveen the Hon. Cauin Ainneslev, of the Fusileer cGuards, Conservative, and Mr. O¶eifly Deane, Roman
CLoN-.EL.-TIe nomination takes place on Monday (this day). The candidates are Mr. Bagwell, Mr. Murray, and hr. Barton, but rumour to-day speaks of the retirement of the last and the substitution, in his stead, of the Hon. Richard Hely Hutchinson. uncle to Lord Donoughmore. At present it would be difficult indeed to speculate upon the result, but, in all probability, there w1il be a sharp contest.
Durinzt (CITy).-By some extraordinary legal blunder a wrong day ws named for the poling, which wan fixed by the Zigh Sheriff for Tuesday instead of Monday. The mistake was discovered on Friday forenoon, and counter notices were immediately published. The contest promises to be a desperate one, but speculation as to the result would be worse than profitless.
DUNGARVAN (BORouG)-I al reports stte that Mr. Beresford Hope is to be a candidate. 14r. Maguire will he says, poU to the last man; but up to the present tlere appear to be nothing more than threats of opposition. Tne election takes place on Tuesday.
GALWVAY (BoRouGnI).-Mr. P. Blake, Q.C., having retired there will be no contest, and Mr. O'Flaherty and Lord Dunkellin (the latter in succesion to Mr. M. J. Blake, re. signed) will be the new members.
KILDAItZ (COUNTY).-The sheriff han appointed Taesday, the 7th of Aprl, as the day of nomination. There wiU be no contest; the effort to induce Lord Otho Fitzgerald to come forward failed.
RInLxENY (CoUtNTY.)-Mr. Greene the late member, is actively prosecuting his canvass. Tie other late sitting member, Mr. Serjeant Shee, has been detainod at Kingston. on-Thames by important business at the assizes, but he purposes, the moment he has fulfiled his engagements, to be at his post, and declares his determination to " fight it to the last." The Hon. Mr. Mostyn hamnot yet come to KU. kenny, but is hourly expected; while his father, Lord Vaux of Barrowden, bhs been there for the past few days, acting on his behalf. CeptsLin Ellis has been engaged in his canvass for a considerable period, and, having personally solicited the CufUNTges of almost every voter in the county, hat
scarcely received a single denial to his application. The nomnination of can,didates in the county takes place on Mfonday, the 6th of April, and the polling on Thursday, the 9th and Saturday, the 11th, as GoodFriday interrenes.
Xnf 's COIJXTY.-MeRSsrS. Bland and F. O'Brien, the late members, will be re-elected without opposition,
QvENS COUNTY.- There is to beha contest, the issueof which will probably be the defeat of Mr. Michael Dunne the late Roman Catholic member, who has fallen under the displeasure of the Ultramontanists. Responding to two
rnqiusxitions soliciting him to become %,mInY'dte, ~t'he-R '-
Hon. J. W. Fitzpatrick, the former Whig moember, hLs consentkd to stand for the county, and from bis great local influence, coupled with the recovery of his lost popularity, at is likely that he will win the seat. Mr. Fitzpatrick, in 1852, finding it impossible to reconcile many of his former aupporters to his vote on the EDcclsiastical Titles' Bill, and wshing to prevent the violence likey to eventuate in a cont teat, retired on the mnerssiug of the election, when Mr. Michael Dutnue wV^s returned wiithout oppesition, as the colleague of Sir Charles C'oote.
TIPPErAtRy (CorwrY).-Mr. Francis Scully, the late eolleague of Jaenes Sadleir, has isued his farewel address. The leading and obvious reason for his retirement from public hfe is thus fairl) st:ted:-
" Muosh an I ylue tti hbi6h distluatlon oA representing so gret a constituency In Parliamoent I hae .a oonscIentious feeling that, under 'he unfortunate ciroumsta,seek in whcoh I am innocen, placed with esept to my liabilitiev to thC creditos ot the Tipperry Ilank by the nefarious actet otber . xod a contest impending, any expenditure of mousy, on my part. would be unlustifiable. I have, therefore, determined not to soict your umfr.geson this ocasIou."
WESTMEATnl.-Tho contest for this countypromiseto be a strong ono. It is quite true that Sitr RichbIi_ Levinge, the bigh Tory of l1-2. has sincO had reason to the errors of his past ways, anti is niow not abaumne to cmoue forward an the nominee of M r. George Henry Moore for the representation of Westweath. In the oourse of his penitentia address to tbh electors Sir Rieliard bays-

(Cheerm) Another subject in which he took grt interest ws that of admInistrtive reform. 'AlL had experienced the neceuity of this during the -last war. 'Why, this counxtry was very nearly shipwrecked, our national Veatness nearly suffered colapse, smply throug the grmsmncapacity of the Govenment. The war had brought these two facts into decided -prominence-first, the scnildalous Incompetency of our Govermuent offioils, and secondly, the tirly Euglish and noble character of our common soldiers. (Cheers.) The mloodand tresure lavished doning the last war were sacrificed
thon e altar of inoompetenoe. And what was the remedy t Wi, they must select men who were capable of representis.g them in Parliamont-men who felt as the electors felt, and who were inibued with their sentiments-men of business habits who knew what they wera about. He took a peculiar interest in. accial questions. 'e was anxioas to seeethe working-classes cared for-to have their hours of toil lessened, without at the same time lessening their wages-to aboolish that horribletrock system-to provide for therpr zoerrecreationand toseethemproperlyrepresened.

While he was prepar.4 to support Lord,Palmerston, to a certainextent, admired his thoroughly EngIseh haracter, andgv 'im dne credit for the firmtnes an energy he haa displayed'in times of ;reat difficulty ad danger, yet he oould not help 2eollecting that LordPal mersio was not a Liberal, and therefore bis support of the noblo lord would ''e only a'qualified one. (Hear, bear.) He (IFr.

(Cheers and aughter.) On this score he must offer lis hearty yrpathY to the cafdidates who came forward on these hustifigs with hiih; he was sorry to see them so called over the coals. The only objections raised against him appeared to be, first, regarding his age, and, secondly, on ucont of'the &oge , toportlon of means 'ith which Providence had been pleased to bless himi. Now, as to his se be did not offer theih'the last years of a used-up poli. tiia; he offered to the electors , his years when they. were of value to him and to his friends, and when, as he believed they miaRt be of value to the 'constituendy Aithough, too, he did not 'wnt to go to the House of Coammons fettered by too many Eroises, he wouldclake this solemn rouaise-nimely, that

He was quite smre that in a borough like Lambeth, with its 250,000inhabitants, there 'would be ample opportunities for him to devote the wealth hepoesse, to the assistance of his poorer brethre. Anbther promise he would make. He would ever hold up his hand against the oppressor, and would go to the House of Commons the pledged friend of the workdngmAn. (loud cheers.)
The show of hands was then taken, and was unmistakeably In fa,ur ot Mr. Roupell and fMr. Williams
A poll 'was' thereupon' lemaended on the part of Mr. Wilkinson, and the proceedings terminated with a deserved vote of thaniks to the returning offioer.
The polling takes place this morning.
GREEMWICH.
The pollng for th'd'borough of *Greenwich took place on Saturday, and ws conducte with great order and without many outward signs of excitement, In Greenwich itself there were bht few flags flying and no colours were shown, except by tho frletds of Mr. Townsend, many of whom wIre blue scarfs or blue rosettes; and these observations will equally apply to Woolwich and Deptford. What eiqltement thereowas was prinipally caused and maintained by the mounted messengers engaged by the different committces, who dashed about upon their ruged steeds, as though the election wus to be won not by votes, but by the tatc at which they plied their spurs. Cabs were engaged by both sides, and towards the close of the day Mrr. Townsend's friends brought up everal omnibus loads of voters. The plI opened *rt8 o'cloc, and at 9 Mr. Townsend was first,
neralCodrington.second; and Mr. Chambers last. The numbers then were:-
Towse4d ,...
Codrington ,.4U Chambers ... 3... ... 38
At 10 o'clock the candidates occupied similar positions, but t 1. o'clock Genpral Codrlngton and Mr. Townsend had changed places The numb&s then stood:-
Codrington... ... . .1,426 Townsend ... ... .. . 1,334 Chambers .., ... ... ... .. 072
From that time the btourl returns of the poll showed simiar results, and at 4 o'ock the numbers were:-
Codrington. ... ... 2.993 Townsend ... ... ... ... ... 2,761 Chamer ... ... ... ... ... 2,075
General Coarington anda r.Townsnd 'were therefore returned by large n;jorities. Towards the close of the day large Aumbers of persons assembrd in front of the hustin
at Greenwich, and as the time for terminating the poWl droe. near the police experienced great difficulty in keepind
clear tbe appoaches to the polling places, which were nder the platform. As soon as the poll was closed, Mr. F. Chap. man, the returning officer, 'went upon the hustings, accompanied by Gexteral Codrington, Mr. Townsend, and a large number of their friends. The appearance of the suessfu candidate3 'was greeted with loud cheers.
Mr. CEayAZX announoed that the declaration of the poll would take place on Mondaymorning at llo'clock.
General CODasJrTOr, 'who was loudly called for, sid-
Gentlemen I.eg to return znybest thanks for your attend- I ance to-day, pd for the exertlons by -which you have placed me at the head of the polL; (Cheers.)
Mr. ToWpmniw thanked the electors for the honour
'which they n hadonme him, and congratulated themtupon I haing in fie days atertedllse indepenldence of the borogth, andthus dedroyed the work of 25 years. (Lond cheers)'
The meeting was afterwards addressed by two or three lcad oratots, who conrtiulited the constituency upon the return of the local and resldent candidate.
General COPRIrouTON afterwards addressed a meeting of
his own and Mr. Chamberss' committee. The galant . General thanked them most cordialy for the exertions I 'which theyhad made to wecure his own retun, and expressed deep regret that 3fr, Chainlers,'who well deserved the confidenco of the borough, was not aain to sit beside him.
Some dissatisfaction"was expressed that Mr. Mhambers was not present, but this 'was removed when Mm. Noble, the chairman ofithe coMmitt0, st-lea that Mr. Chambers had conniissioned him to thank thae committee for their services, and wZinld, no doubt, be present on londay to thank them himself.
Air. Chamntere' _dfeatis attrbuted by his supporters grncipallyto the fact of his having sapported the Sunday lrding Bill Antroduced by Lord Robert Grosvenor. This measure excited much opposition in Greenwich, especiaUly among those classes who derive considerable profits from the inulux of visitors fro.m lonion on a Sunday. During the canvass gea' exerslons wer made to convince the electors belonging to these classes that Lord Robert Grosvenor's Bill 'would not hs,ve miintated against their interests, but it was only in afewv instasiyes that these efforts were successul.
Seine hostility 'waa also excited against Mfr. Chambers b;~ ' the fact that hethsd not been p resent at so many divisions as the' people of 7leenwiche uh eouh ohv voted in. . s-ogtbouhtoae

LORD .?ALMERSTON.

Lord PArm5TsOz, on rising to respond to the toast, wa5 greeted with loud cheers. lis Lordship SaId,-Mr. aole and Gentlteuen,-I beg f9y myself and for my colleages to return yon our most heartfelt thanks for the honour you have done us in drinking our healths, and for the entliusiastic mant6r in which lt'has been teceived. For my eolleagues Ireturn thanks 'for the way' in which they, as publicmen, re thaDked..by communties 'with which they are not personallyacquainted, but who are pleased to ap. prove the -public conduct 'we have jointly puIrsued. (Cheers.) For myself, gentThinen, Treally, withlout any affectation, muSt say that it is impossible for me adequately to expres the thanknessr. te... gratification, and the pride 'whichIfeelat the-reception 'which I have met with at your hands. (Cheers.) I have had the honour now for, I
believe, rather m ore than 20 years to represent this to-wn
in ParliameAt, and, in that priod I may justly hope and flatter myself that I have made not only acquaintances ad friends, but that there are many of those whom I have the
honour of addressing on the present occasion who entertain for me those feelings of friendship and regard which I
sra proud to say I feel for them, (Cheers.) At all time., therefore, it must be highly gratifying to me to visit the tow. from 'which I have received so many marks of good.
will, and to returrn to it teceiving renewed proofs of confidence in thq pub4m course 'which it has been my fortune to
pursue; but, gentlemenle.this is d most peculiar moment, an appeal having been made to the coontry on a question of great national importance. I look upon the reception you
have been kind enough to give me, 'rnot only as a proof of your personi) feehigg towirdS myself and colleagues, but as
yourappreciation.of that, expression of national feeling (cheers) which has passed over the vwhole surface of the land from north to south and from east to West, upon the ques.
'tion on 'which the'Jeopleo'6f tbin eountry have felt tbat the
natiO&'aintires, ilia ,ronal rights, and the national dig. nity were concerned. (Cheers.). There are many peopleFomt few at-home0'end a great many abroad-who totally misonder6tand the chacter of the Bitish nation. (Hear.)

grest numbers from many of the largest cities and commer. cial communities-addreeses which I have not the vanity to take to myself, but which were the expression of tho
inational feeling upon subjects in which theyfyeitthe national interest and the nationsl honour were concerned; but the other day, gentlemen, I had the honouir to receive a doe. putation from Bristol, a nimilar one from Liverpool,a and from MAnchester, expressing regret and sur prims at what had happened in the House oi Commons to the Government, and of their deter mination to support it One of these gentlemen said I am a iberal, but my friend who comes with me is a Con. servative, and this addrssfrom Bristol has received 2,000 signatures, and includes every class of society- and every shade of political opinions. (Cheers.) Tho same happened in Liverpool, and thoeo who were hind enough to bnng me an address said it was exhibited only fortwo or three hours, but it contained 940 signatures, including all those largely concerned In the commercial and trading interests of the town, and who have the greatest interest in avoiding what is calculated to interrupt the peaeful relations of the country. I say these things make one more proud than ever of the country in which it is our lot to be born, and these things teach an instmetive lesson to public men, because they show that where there is a rightful cause, and where the nation is called spoii to vindicato its rights and assert its dignity, the Go. vernment is sure to have the support of the people; but also it is a warning that these feelings and this enthu.
iasm and noble spirit are not to be trifled with; and that if the Government were to involve the country needlessly in hostiliti*s the Government would undoubtedly suffer the penaltyjbf its folly. (Cheers.) It was my good or ill for. tune, while I held the department of the Foreign-offEce, to have many difficult things to deal with. I have been accased of being the firebrand of Europe, and one atesman of Europe even said that I was a European calamity. (Taughterandcheers) Iwas accused of exciting revolution everywhere, and disturbing the peaceful state of Europe. Now gentlemen what I did, and what the Government of which I was the organ did, was to encourage and support, as far as we could with propriety, those nations who endeavoured Ito improve tfieir Institutions cheers) and to obtain for themselves the blessings of that Parliamentary government which we in England have so long enjoyed Ididn't indcie the people or encourage the nations to seek for internal changes whioh could not be reasonably accomplished; but when theywere possible of accomplMsnment then we said, "Hlere is our hand; we will lead you on, and trust you may reach the goal which you are honourably strivmg to obtain." We had a great deal to do with the independence of Belgium, in which we were opposed by a ditingniahed maniber of the Rouse of Commons, who was adverse to what we were about, and who characterized it as an experiment of the "noble lord"-meaning ue. (Laughter.) But, gentlemen, this independent monarchy, unlke many experimental farms which we witness (laughter) turned out a ver,r succesful undertaking, and that peoplo have now a King of their own cholce, and enjoy a degree of Political liberty and happiness wEhch few of the nations on the continent have ad an oppoxtunity to share. Well, then again in Spain we took part with the people against the pretender, who had inscribed despotism on his bannert and supported the Queen, wiho had freedomn and the constitution inscribed on her flag, and though we succeeded, and though Spain has not carried into practice those great principles, yet still she
a a Parliament, and where the forms of freedom exist depend upon it, gentlemen, sooner or later the subsance will follow. (Cheers) Well, then, in Portugal we supported the QQeen against her usurping uncle, who had the support ofinanyiu this country who ought not to have supported his catse, and Portugal, I am happy to say, is in a greater degree enjoying the practical application of Parliamentary governmenit. (Chers.) Well,thnen, gentlemen, All these things being accomplished withouten ging this country in war, yet those lwo contributedinthis countrr to these happy results or by somo gentlemen caled the Srebrands -the great calamities of Europe (Hear, hear.) And therefore, when I un told my policy is turbulent-and agres sive, why then, gentlemen,I appeatothepast andevidence is not wanted in regard to these accusations when applied to the future. (Cheers.) The present dispute is One of far freater importancein principle than persons may imagine.
Sa misake to suppose Utat we are at war with ChinU
As yet the collsion has been purely local, and the Emperor of China may yet disavowv the barbain who has been the cuse of it, but at the same time I don't espect tht vwhen Lord El*i4 reaches China that willthave actnally hap pened. 1 am inclined to think he wll find thinges muh in the same state as when the last accounts left, and that the Emperor has trusted to the chapter of accidents to see what will arse out of the collision. The Emperor of China is now ln a vay singular And critical position. There is a rebelion going on, which having begun to the south of Canton has now quitted the south of the ernpire-which hla now reached its centre-which has now reached Xankin, the ancient capitAl of the Chinese empire, and that circumstance adds to the doubt as to what will be the decision of the Imperial Government But, gentlemen, we have chosen a man of high rank and great expetience, who distinguished himself by his government of Canada (cheers); who successfully ne%oti4ted a tteate vwith the United States; a man of great abilit and concuiatoryr disposition, with a full knowledgeof the Intentions of the Government at home; whose mission is intended as no disparagement to Sir John Bowring; whose mission Is founded onthe established practice of the country in difficult cases ; tud I trust that Lord Elgin, backed as hewil be by an overwhelmi naval force, double that which Sir Wiliam Parker had in the late China warwad backed also by a large military force-that he will be able to effect the objects sought; and if fair means fil he will also be able to make his demoands felt and known by means which the Chinese Government will not, I think, he disposed to feel without amendment. (Cheers.) Therefore it is a most gratifying thing to find tho feelitgs of the country so uaninmousy expressed on this question, and yoU ;may depend upon it the very remoteness of the sceae of action and the limited nature of the contest
hich' gong on 'wll make it more striking to foreign countros-'I more strikingly manifest the patriotic feel. ings of the Britlsh nation-and be productive of the best results with reLard to our future relations with other countries who might otherwise be tempted to encrosch and trespass upon your representative with impunity and moet vith no resistance, for it is an bonourable policy for a country to showitself watchful of its rightsandd to seo early beginnings. You may stop be innings with ease, but if you wait ntil they bave arrived at difficulties of magnitude our exertions must be commensuate with the grievance; and wars 'which may be stopped in the commencement involve the country iu exertions and expense which may be avoided by timely action and more prudenrt conduct. ( iCheers) And therefore, gentlemen, it is 9uite a mistake o say that those public offlcers who take timely measures to stop early begihnings are fond of war; they are the
bet ,arinso : ae foritis onlywhEen the nnstter is known, and as advane itsellE, and our representative has been vatchful to prevent encroachment, it is only thon that we can expect that respect and abstinence from those encroachmnents upon its right,sand fromofferingitinsults. (Cheers.) We are often told to look to our consins in the United States as models of conduct, and there ire some things in vhich they might just as well look to ns (a laughi, but if we beg of the advocates of peace to address themselves with "eyes right" to the United States, pray whiat dlid their commander do in this very difficulty in China in comparison with onr offcers civil and naval ? Whby. thercvag
a boat belonging to one of their ships of war fired at. Well, that was a great insult, but there mnight have been an excuse made for it that wo were engaged in these hos-
tilities with China, and it might have been said that this American was taken for an English boat. It is true the officers in that boat waved the American flag, but the Chinese might have said that is s ell known strategy of
ar, and you wave the Anerican flag to deeeivo us; we beieved it was an English boat, and therefore fired at it. But did the American com mander, like Sir 3ichacl Seymnour and Sir John Bowring, demand an apology and dermand that a similar thing should not occur again? Not the least in the world. He inverted the usnal course which is said to be characteristic of energy-a word nd a blow; he put it thus,-a blow and a worg- (Cheers and laughter.) He began to knock down the tort, and after destroying that fort he sent to the Commissioner to say An insult had been offered to his flag, and he hoped for an apology (cheerr) and an assurance to the effect that It would not happen again (cheers); and he gave 24 honrs for this Apoloyr and expla.
nation to be sent to him; but before these 24 hours had expired the ship which-as lying near this fort saw something or other go on wbich the officers shrewdly i v
for renedved efence, if not for renewed sttak. W el this American officer, without waiting and writing tothe United States to know what to do-without waiting for orders from Washington-he did not wait even for the 24 hours to expire, but hesaid, "No, no, Mr.Chinamana, this won't do you are throwingupfreshbatteries andputtinginfreshgans and he commenced the demolition of the fort and took possession
of these guns before the tine had expiredwhich he hadgiven the Chinese Commissioner in order to make his apology and explanation. (Cheers.) Well, then, we are told our officers were precipitate ; but gentlomen, they went step by step
there was an interval of time in order to enable the Chinese Comnissioner if hechose to make san pology nd DPromise of amendment in the future, which at that timo had been
deLwanaed. 5Hea. But then It was said that Sir John Bowing 2 a Sir bcael Sevmour made a soeond deeand which tho offioers in China had been forbidden to make In deptches sent oat some,eightor 10 years aeo * and aiobe friend of mine, with whom I w tking bette thae divldozI in the House of Lord, said he should vote aginst thio G-

had written in 1847. I maid don't attach imortanoe to what *,ny gentleman wrote in 1847, but look to the i m - stances of the present cao. NoW the case it the pzeV6'tf 15 different. We said, in 18I7, don't yo& be en unfr,iendly terms with the Chinese Government at Canton, but trade in the sual course; don't you eoohmenoo hostilties to obtain the fulfilment of our A hle aocordingto the tres.t ot Ms;kiln, whIch getli"ePnfi
subjects a right to trade in every one of the five town, ef which Canton was one. True, we think there, would Ibe advantpge in it--a manifest advantage there would be' If the British merchant out of the town and the ChIne
merchant in the town could hold a. direct commun1dation instead of through agents, brokers, and peoo! of ,that Port, for the British merchant at Canton is at the mercyof this clas-s of people; he cannot cairy on his business advantageously as in the other four towns; therefore thern Is a real value in the thine. Beides, in order to keen the English out of Canton the Cbinese Commissioner oraered the people to insult them, while the people outside treat the En ish respectfauy. Sir John Bowfing himself, acooipanied by two or three gentlemen and two Englis lsdieit
walked round the suburbs of Canton, and ho ays tbit he found the Chinese themselves a trading people; that they are not a cruel or- insulting race as the mndarins are, and if left to thomslves would trett our people with. the ame civllity and good wiJ a ottidde
tO1, or * they are treated at Shanghai ; and that evywhere else where the Chineae and Enlish tre umolated everythi went on on the mwot friendly and somnfortable footing. erefoe, 1 say, the obstacle was artfully created, and its removal would be attended with oommercial advautage to the merchants at Hongkcong aLnd Canton. But we said don't interrupt peaoefts yelations for the xake.Bf this advantage, but it was interrupted on othner grounds, and then it was obvious the personal intercourse betweenL our officers andl Chinese offiers would aid mht prob bly tend to settle difficulties on the occasion, an .d f contine
In the future to prevent future misunderstanding also. Well, that which Sir John Bowring told Sir Michael Seymour to ask for was not for permis6ion which I ana my colleagnes had desired the Superintendent ind Plenipotentiary not to acquire by force of arms-it was not to enter Canton-it %is the right to have personal intercourse between our authorities at Canton and the authoritleawitbin the town-it was for a freer com =nnnication,A4 .fr the indiscriminate entrance of all British subjects. IXyjt was proper demand, properly demanded, and ther*eould be no 'pretence to refuse, and the obvious effect of it wouild have been to prevent future mitAes and to heal the present differences; and, supposing Commimsioner Yeh didn't mean to bring abont aruopure, Iwill undertake to say if we had had direct comamumcation at the time the Arrow was boarded and her crew carried away-I may it kaa been possible for SirJohn Bowring or Sir Micheal Seynour to explain the nature of the question, and to argue the question inafriendly mannerwiti the Chinese authorittithe wel ch has since taken place would have been pr
vented. Well, gentleman, great injustice has been done -to Sir John Bowring. (Hear, hear.) Sir John Bowring was chosen by me to go as consul to Canton, and when a vancy in the govarmment at CAnton occurred he was transferred to it ly Lord Clarendon. But what is Sir John B°own sd what was he.? It has been said to be tbe fashion to %Pl in responsible situatin nsnone but members of the ariseocrayitawsbceenthe fasson to say these appointmentg go by favour, and not by merit. He. was mot amember of the aristocracy ;hehadnotapowerful iMfulence to protoct ana aupporthiim;hewasamanlIk* manyothers inthiseotmtry andas any oters wil, I hope, coniinue to be-erie

Whyhze was forarznercare. tary of the Peac Society (cheers)_-a man of tie qaletest, most kindly, and benevolent diposition-a , I beI eve, who never had a quarrl with morta mnan, who lovea pesee, wrhose life had been devoted to questiong connected with theo l intercour of nations with comm e with trade, with the removal of all impediments wuhicnhhecked and confined the intercour6e of nations-he had been em.
i Ded ir, con tcwtoz with Lord Clarendon to arrnge a cttea or dutes between England and PrAnce, and by hirn also employed to induce the Gvernment of Austria to liberalize their tariff with ao view of increasing the comierclal relations between Austria and England, and he was therefore peculiatly adspted to the office, which oonsisted mainly in guarding the commercal interests of thig country h our commercial relations withanationlike Chins, and le was therefore one of the last men to mau6e his power or to plunge his country into difficulties :aud war. (Hear, hear.) And therefore it would have been the greatest baseness for the ske of a few votes to try to reverse the adverse verdict of the Hotae of Conmons by throwing over an agent who performed his duty to the best of his ability, and whoso conduct in our hearts we approved. We felt that every Englishman with a Briti6h hieart ia his bosom would have done exactly the same thing under similar circumstances. (Cheersm) I will venture to eay I could name some gentlemen who are the oras of the peace party who would not have been less vigorous than Sir John Bowring. It was no diement to Sir John Bowmng in ppointing ord Eigin to go out; to settle this dfficulty. When special diffliculties arise special men are sent out to settle them. Lord BgiC has thus gone out without superseding Sir John Bowring, who will contue to be what he is trusted and conSded in by the English Government. Lord El' '
mission is for a special purpose, and when it is fLnished, as I hope it WilM oo in a twelvemonIth or a kttle more, he wil return and leave Sir John Bowsing In exactly the same position in which he is now. Well, gentlmen, r have taken advantage of your kindness (Cries of "Go on I I have made what is a great deal more than an afterdinner speech ought to be, but I am sure you feel a great interest in the events passing, and I felt it my duty to give these explanations, such as they are, for I am sma ed -the more these matters are looked into, the more they are -a. derstood, and the more the details are looked into by the people of this country, the more the nation will be confirmed in the choice of representative; the more we shall feel that we stand upon sure ground, and that this week, and the next week-, and the week after will give opportunity of sho ig us the sentnieorts of the electors of everypt of the country.

The MV Os declared that Sir George Grey had been elected on a show of hands.
Sir G. Gntz expressed his thanks for the honour conferredupon him, and, in the coutse of his observations said that Her M.jesty had dissolved Parliament by the advice of her Ministers in order toascertain whether the country would annul the recent decision of the House of Commons with respect to transactions which had occurred in another part of the globe, and in which Government had felt it to be its duty to give support to their officers, civil and miltary. Wit regard to the im1ediate ouestion which had led to the dissolution of Parliament, an upon which the appeal had been madotothe country he bad no anolog to make for the cousth oemetadakn r

With regard to this question, he thought it would hve been unjust if the Gorernmenthad scrificed the offlcerz engaged In the war to save themselves; thereforo two courses were open-one of which was to advise Her Majesty to appeal to the people, after sutch a vote had been passed, whether they were satisfied with the conduct of the Government; or wvether they would ratify the vote of the Vouse of Commons. He believed the appealto tho oountry would be answered satisfactorily. There wereothermat. ters on which the Govermnent had a right to appeal to tbe support and confidence of the country, and one of them was that in which the country took the deepest intercst, from the conviction of the justice of the cause in which it was undertaken, and that was the late war. When eircumstances took plce which caused distress to the country, and the House of Commons felt it to be its dutv that mneaue
sbould be taken for the due prosecution of the war, and when- it was felt that t,hiS dut should be pace
in the bands of those best fitted to bring that 'War to a successful termination, Lord Palmerston, being called upon, assumed the reins of Governwent at the call of his countrymen. His colleagues rallied round him, and he (Sir Cl. Grey) need only appeal to the success of our arms in the East, to the efficient state of orarraies,whichwere never in abetter position to carry on. operations with a prospect of success, and in consequence of whieh their opponents bad suffered such a degree of exbaus. tion that peace became necessary to themn. He thought their Ambassadors, Lords Clarendon aud Cowley, hbad acted in a satisfctory maanner in obtaining that which it was the duty of the country to agree to-the traty of peace- concluded at Paris. Peace baving been obtained, they could not be too thankful for the blessinR; andhe hoped that the govermnent would now be occupied in reduacing the burdens of the people and on the improvement of their moral and social welfare. With regard to the incomen-tax being kept up at 7d. instead of 5d., they Vere now at peace, anZ were paymg the debts incurred by the war, and this was in order that these debts should be paid within a atipulted timc

LONDON, MONDAY, MARC 30, 1857.
The appeal to the people has been answered with a force and distinctness beyond our anticipations -we may even say our wishes. A mild rebuke and moderate discouragement were the utmost that we hoped or desired for a policy which was rather factious and mischievous than wholly unprincipled, and we certainly did not expect the signal retribution which has fallen on the heads of its' authors. The Ieague has disappeared from Parlianment. COBDEN has been beaten by 246 votes at Huddersfield; BniGHuT and MiNEB GIBsox by from 2,000 to 3,000 votes at Manchester ; AnTAGe is beaten,at Salford by a Ministerial stranger only two or three days in the field; WAIxsSLEY is thrown out at Leicester, and, nearer home, at the Tower Hamlets,we lose the familiar name of Sir W. CLAY. LAYARD loses his seat at Aylesbury, and Sir F. BARING has scarcely saved his at Portsmouth, -which he has represented for twenty-five years. Mr. GLADSTOSE losesB the noisy support of Mr. R. PHILLIMORE, vwho has been paired out vith his brother, and, for the present at least, the quieter vote of Sir S. NoRTHooTE. On the other side are two remarkable casualties. Mr. F. PzBL has been beaten at Bury, and Admiral BERKELEY, First Naval.Lord, has been turned out of his seat at Glocester by Sir R. W. C'ABDEN. Among the new members, the return of CONINGHAsu for Brighton counts at least one against the loss of some strong Liberals elsewhere, and Kn-OGKE at Bridgewater is compensation for the loss of LAYAnD. The results of two severe struggles may be set off one against the other. Lord JoN TussEu has come in third on the poll in the City, throwing out his antagonist, Mr. RAiXES CuRRix; and Mr. BBnsAn Os:o"m brought in his colleague vith himself against a powerful opposition at Dover. Lord JoHN RIussma owes his return partly to the Tories and partly to the grateful exertions of the community whose political rights he has advocated with so much perseverance and so little success, but whose claims cannot be again postponed after the reiterated decision of the constituency in their favour. Such are some of the incidents of only half the General Election. The Ministerial gain already is over 20, and more may confidently be expected from the counties and other constituencies yet to declare themselves.
The moral of all this is very plain. The British people do not like dictation. They wil not be deliberately negotiated and sold by a coalition. They will not be tripped up by a sudden and unforeseen combination. They will not be snugly disposed of by Associations, or made the vulgar bondsmen of a League. It is against tyrannies of the latter sort that the constituencies both of London and Manchester have suCcessfully revolted. You have only to prove to an Englishman that he has been superseded in the exercise of his conscience, his judgment, or his political rights, by some people who think themselves wiser and better than hp is, and he is sure to rise in insurrection. But whatIhe hates the most is hypocrisy, organized or not. HE will not sell his conscience at a momenes warning to any set of gentlemen who may want a better warranty than their own for a convenient opinion, an extempore principle, or a factious censure. In this instance the whole British people were suddenly called on to censure, not only the conduct of a British Plenipotentiary under most difficult circumstances and in a course utterly impossible to be retraced, but, what was more absurd still, the conduct of HER MASTYs Govemrmeit, for not condemning and repudiating what it is admitted on all sides they must, good or bad, follow up. These self-constituted gutardians of public morality, finding England involved, through her agents as they chose to think, in a national sin, of which they fully intended not only to share, but, if possible, to monopolize the fruits, conceived the splendid idea of making the Government the scapegoat, and then stepping in themselves, to reap with a clean conscience the harvest of crime. Nobody at home could prevent, or even remedy, what had been done. Nobody even suggested the idea of making amends. The most obstreperous conscience-mongers did not dare to whisper restitution. It was assumed on all sides, by the most sanctimonious as well as by the least pretending, that, be the beginning bad or good, we must go on with it. But these traffickers in conscience, these buyers and sellers of public morality, and hucksters of national reputation, thought it would be a profitable day's work if they could stigmatize what they bad not the least thought of revoking, and so blast the character of their own country before all the world, for the sake of damaging the position of their political rivals. Now, this is precisely what the English do not choose to do, or to have done for them. They will not hold their consciences at the bidding of political speculators. They admit themselves to be fallible; they may be seduced into erroneous judgments; they are addicted to various fanaticisms of a religious and self-damaging character, but they wrill not be the ready slaves of a gainful hypocrisy; they wMll not suddenly present themselves like a stage troop of -devotees, to shriek, in the words of a master, some
morbid sentiment or some frantic objurgation. They will think and feel for themselves. They will, too, be bath just and conistent. They wiml not mate themselves by heaping criminality on others not less innocent; nor do they think so lightly and conveniently of a grave moral cenure as to pronounce it'and set it at nought at one and the same time.
* The most decisive replies to this grana appeal come from the more commercial part of the empire. It is in its own birthplace that the League has been extinguished. How is this I If we might venture to interpret the voice of the people, they feel very much about this Ohinese affair as one of our highest commercial authorities, and a man of undoubted honour, has expressed himself. The opinion of Baron oTarscHinD is entitled to all the more weight as it is given freely, and not extorted by political pressure. " He had been asked," he said in Guildhall on Friday, " how he would have voted " on the China question. Now, as a commercial Cc man, he would state, without entering into the "merits or the details of the question, that he should "unhesitatingly have voted with the Government. "The Government ought to avoid every occasion "for plunging the country unnecessarily into the "miseries of war; but as a commercial man he
"thought it well for the principal to confir= the "acts and contracts which his agents were em"powered to enter into and had. a right to "make. He knew the disadvantage that agents "laboured under when the confirmation of their " acts was doubted, and the effect which that doubt "C and uncertainty would have in the negQtation " of other great questions." This is a commonsense, and, as we believe, an mnanswerable, view of the case. It is necessary that we should have Plenipotentiaries with the fullest powers, and naval and military officers to co-operate with them, for the preservation of our great interests and rigixts in those distant regions. Of course for the selection of these Plenipotentiaries the Governments at home are seriously responsible; but, unless the case be very strong indeed against them, we must adopt their acts, or otherwise we shall never get men of real honour and competent ability to accept such a position or do their duty in it. , In this instance all sides are agreed to adopt the acts of our Plenipotentiary; nor is there any other possible course. The only difference is one which, if it is no difference as regards the present question, is a most tremendous difference as regards tbe national character and the future position of British Plenipotentiaries in distant regions, surrounded by difficulties, and in the face of cruel and treacherous foes. The difference we allude to is simply this -While Lord PAisToN's Government takes the regular course of simply backing without censure proceedings which it sees no reason to censure, the Opposition were for censuring by word, but backing up in deed; for disclaimingo the author, but assuming his work; denouncing the seed, but gathering in the crop. Hypocrisy of this sort is not only meanness. In the East it -would be well understood; for it is the way of the worst plotters and suborners to accept the deed and disown the doer. The attempt now defeated by the people of England is a notable improvemen's on this very stale hypocrisy. It aimed to procure not the commission of a crime but the imputation of one; and so obtain not only the spoils of the alleged victim, but also the place of the aUeged criminal.
Sir DE LACY EVANS is the first-born of the new
Sir DE IiCY EvANs is the first-born of the new Parliament. His election was the first declared, and he is consequently entitled to act as Speaker until the regular functionary be appointed. A better representative for Westmiunster than the gallant old General could scarcely be found, and his former colleague, Sir J. V. SmY, is returned -with him. The representation of Marylebone also remains undisturbed, notwithstanding the feeble effort made by the ultra-Puitans to displace Sir B. HALL in consequence of the Sunday Bands. The other metropolitan returns of which it will be necessary to make mention are those for the City, for the borough of Finsbury, and the Tower Hamlets. In the first, Mr. CK&wronD is the new arrival, Baron RoTnsc=nrD, Lord JoHN RuSSELJ, and Sir JArEs Duxz remaining as before; in the second, Air. Cox is the fresh addition to the new Parliament; and in the third Mr. AimTON, a new Liberal, ousts an old one, Sir W. C"-Y. Westminster, Marylebone, the City of London, the Tower Hamlets, and Finsbury have thus completed their respective tasks; the result of the contests in Lambeth and Southwark we shall know this day. We cannot, however, pass over without especial remark the entire and complete smash of the Rump of the Corn Law League. The constituency of Manchester have rejected Mr. BrioHT and Mr. MmINqR GiBsoN. Mr. CoBDxx has shared the same fate at Huddersfield. Even Sir E. AnsuTAGE has been defeated by Mr.MAss, the Treasury candidate. The sense to discern the signs of the times has been denied them, anathey have paid the penalty of their blindness. Surely the country has not been ungrateful to them, nor unmindful of their past services. But for the recollection of what they had done-of the great -things they had accomplished in their time, they would long since have been dismLsed to the limbo of all useless and impracticable politicians. Still, with it all, we regret the fate which has overtaken Mr. BxIGHT and Mr. CoBDrN. NWothing can be more alien to our feeling than to insuit these gentlemen with an expression of commiseration when the battle of life hwa for the moment turned against them. Save in so far as for personaland domesticaffliction theyneed not thepity of any man. Howmanyamong public men nowliving have done what they have accomplished I What we now say with regard to Mr. BnYGRT we said when the contest was as yeb undecided, and when the constituency of Manchester had not as yet passed upon him a vote of ostracism. We can well understand that Manchester should have desiredto free itself from the dictation of the League; perhaps the object might have been obtained, and yet the resolution haye been more gracefully carried out. With rAgard to Mr. CoBDEw, we can only repeat that i our opinion, while he is living and in the full possession of his faculties, no English House of Commons will be complete without him. Let the conrtituencies think, not upon what he has done since 1846, but upon the energy, the singleness of purpose, the zeal with which he fought the Fight for Food for many a long year, when that fight was no easy one. He is not a man to be cast aside like a chipped brick. Unless we much mistake the signs of the tines, there is a little cloud upon the horizon-as yet no bigger than a man's hand-which denotes a time when his services may again be called into requisition. For ten years we have opposed these two gentlemen in well nigh every act of their public lives, and yet now we most honestly say that we deeply regret to see erased from the rollcall of the House of Commons the names of Jom0I BmRinT
and RIWHAID COBDEN.
It may be of help to our readers if we proceed brieflyto note the chief changes which have taken place so far in the English representation. We may first notice the change which has occurred in the representation of Plymouth. Mr. J. WILsoN, the. Secretary to the Treasury, has taken the place of Mr. lPO".DELL PAIxn, who voted with the majority on the Chinese question,
but who wisely did not offer himself for re-election at all. Mr. SAxsow RIcARDo has been ousteElfrom Windsor by MIr. VA.NsIT T. Sir STAFFORD NoRTucoTz is about to offer himself as a candidate fer one of the divisions of Devonshire; and Mr. EL B. SBRERIDN, by an act of happy audacity, has leaped into his seat at Dudley. Mr. Jomr EVEILYN DRNIsox has abandoned lIalton, in Yorkshire, for North Nottinghamshire, and Mr. J. BRowx has taken his place. Mr. W. ADAsS is a subBtitute for Mr. B. BoNz CABBEL at Boston, in Lincolnshire. Mr. GzoBGE SANDAnS, a Conservative, loses his seat forWakefield, and is replaced byMr. CHARLtESWORTH Mr. J. H. M.aRswill represent Salisbury in the new -Parliamsent in the place of Mr. W. J. CEAP-LI, the Chairman of the South-Western Railway. Sir JoHn DUCRwORTH has retired from Exeter, and Mr. GIAi takes his place without a contest. Lord WrraAn POWL.ETT has disappeared from Ludlow, and Mr. BOTFxELD fills his place. At Leominster Mr. Jonx GEORGE PnrrmonE has given way to Mr. H. WILLOUGHBY. Mr. ARTHUR Gou:owr, son of Lord ABEPRDEEI, has also failed in securing a seat. He had resigned Beverley, and has been defeated in a strange attempt to supplant Mr. W. GRAYr by professing Chartist opinions at liskeard. Mr. H. M. CIaIToBD is the substitute for Sir ROBERT PnRIc at Hereford. At Cardiff Mr. WALTER Co?rN has been set aside, and Colonel STuART reigns in his stead. At Newark there is a change of both members. The Earl of IarcoLN and Mr. HAsunY have displaced Messrs. HARcOURT VERNON and MAI.-Rs SuTToN. The Duke of NwcAsrTigs influence is supreme in the borough, so the change to a certain extent is aI matter of course. Mr. HoRNBY has replaced. M. FzimDEN at Blackburn. General PERRoNET Toaomrsow has at length succeeded in securing a seat for Bradford, tice Mr. RoBERT MLL,IGAM. Mr. FOLJANmF. has taken the place of the Hon. W. E. DUNco=MB for East PRetford. There will thus be one Nottinghamshire magnate in place of another in the new Parliament. Lord Wors.Y, the son of the Earl of YARBOROUGH, naturally falls into Grimsby, and Lord. AxsExy retires. At Aylesbury Mr. BERN2ARD, a local Conservative, has displaced Mr. LAYAnD. At Bury a more serious loss has been iucurred,-bIr. PaLrPS has taken the place of Mr. F. Psxa. Admiral BERxHELY, the Senior Naval, Lord, has been signally defeated at Glocester by Alderman Sir ROBERT W. CARDEN. AMr. W. CONIvGoAZ, an " advanced" Radical, has ousted Lord AR1vu HERVEY from the representation of Brighton. At Buckingham Sir HARRY VERm-bE succeeds Lord CnicNDOS; and at Newport Mr. CHARLES BUcnsToNB takes the place of Mr. KmiwARD. Sir JoHN TnaAwwny, at Tavistock, has been returned in the place of Mr. ROBERPT PmLIxoRE. The only serious act of riot which has sullied the progress of the present election has occurred at Kidderminster. Mr. Lowr, in that town, has received considerable injury from the violence of a mob of ruffilans, but not, as we trust, of so serious a nature as to alarm his friends. Thus far the changes which have taken place afford strong evidence of the real feeling of the constituencies upon the question on which the Minister has appealed to the country. We doubt not that ere sunset to-day this evidence wil have become yet more conclusive. The chief gain was always looked for in the counties, but from these the returns cannot, of course, be received until next week. There is little reason, then, to suppose that the national policy, which now appears to be that of the Emperor of CHIN as well as of Lord PAnRmSToN, will not be endorsed by the new House of Commons.
Sir JAMES GRAHAM is the very man for a public
Sir JAESM GR&sA is the very man for a pubEc speaker. No wonder the electors of Carlisle were charmed with such lucid arguments and such seductive delivery-with an oration conveying the most plausible case possible in the most agreeable manner imaginable. It is hard to say, indeed, wha' the speech loolk most like-whether its first purpose is a censure of Lord, PAUNISTONr and his policy, or a panegyric upon Carlisle and its inhabitants. First comes a string of compliments to the constituency, and not only to the constituency, but to everything connected with it-to the town, the Mayor and Corporation, and the market-place-to the sobriety of the audience (though the, speaker was a good deal interrupted), and to his " old blue flag' (though banners were not allowed). T'hen came the charge against Government, and certainly, if any candidate during the last three days has connposed a case for an Opposition, it must be Sir JA=ES GPr.H. Lord PiAsiRsTox's Administration engaged in the Chinese war unjustly, without necessity, and, what is more, doliberately, and not by accident. They conducted the Persian war in a fashion disrespectful to the representatives of the people and the people themselves. The consequences are to be found in heavy taxation-a burden which is further increased by all kinds of needless salaries and offices. Finally, Lord P,,mrmsTox was a Tory-a regular Tory-in fact, "a n old Tory of the deepest dye so that the present state of affairs was delusive, unsatisfactory, and not to be acquiesced in. Havingthus shown that his opponents were entirely wrong, his friends entirely right, and the electors of Carlisle the most exemplary and enlightened umpires in the world, Sir J. GEAHiM dropped the Orator for a minute, and delivered his last sentiment in the character of a man of businems. "Let ccme advise you," said he, "to go to the poll 5"early to-morrow. Early polling is safety " after which wholesome maxim and a neat allusion to the tricks of Cumbrian wrestling he retired, amid loud cheers.
It is really a pity that the best part of so telling an address should be upset by the intelligence published in the very coluramns which reported it, and Sir J 'AMMS must now wish that he had adhered more strimtly to his own proposition of not saying much about the Chinese war. That war; according to the information just received, is now over, the justice of our proceedings against YEH and his populace having been recognized by the best of all judges-YEx's own master. The Chinese Government has confessed the British authorities to be right. In fact, as regards the admission to Canton, it could hardly do otherwise, for the Imperial Court had assented to the desired conditions long ago. If there is, in reality, an end of the Chinese topio, we might, with much truth, describe Lord PAL-maTOx rather as a peace Minister than a war Minister, for this pacific arrangement, if carried out, will actually be the third by which his Administration has been distinguished. In plain truth, however, as the Government were not to be charged with the rupture at Canton, so neither can they be credited with its adjustment. The transaccions from first to last have been conducted by our authonties on the spot, and when to all the previous arguments on their behalf is added the testimony of the Chinese Court itself, we think their justification is pretty complete.
As to the "taxation" point-that is always, and we fear always will be, a safe point for a Popular speaker. Neither we nor Sir JAsizs Will ever ee the day when there will not be more taxes than people like, and what people don't like they are always glad to hear may be got tid of. But why complain of "Prison Inspectors, Factory "Inspectors, Inspectors of the Poor Law, Lunacy 2C Inspectors, Inspectors of Education, anr Coal." mine Inspectors T' Surely there is not a single -'officialin th whole list whose directfunction is knot One of- popular U5efUIeaSS Or eharity. Could
Ia manufacturing -or a-miling- populatiolt vn-
tertain any objection to officers whose agV was to preserve themn as far as posible frm the accidents or injuries contingent upon their calling? Should gaols or madhouses be exempted from public control I Should that education Which Sir JAMES in this very speech lays so much stress upon 'oe deprived of the advantages which sys tematic direction impart T Or, if all these things are right in themselves, and yet wrong when ordered by Government, does Sir JA;AS mean to say that they ought to be paid for more directly by those getting the, benefit of them, and that nobody, for instance, should help the north-country miners except the miners them2selves? As to the question of the Estimates, reproduced for the occasion, the military and naval expenditure may still be higher than it was before the war; but, if the difficulties of a transition period are fairly considered, we think a reduction of 17,000,0001. upon these figures in a single year ought to be looked upon as a good earnest of retrenchment.
But what is to be said of the last charge of all -the "clincher" of the speech-that Lord PA&n 3MERSTON is nothing less than a genuine Tory Minister? Sir JIMEs not only asserted this in remarkably plain and uncompromising terms, but told a little anecdote to show that the Tories themselves were exactly of this opinion. In the House of Commons one evening a certain Tory member-" an old friend," as Sir J±iexs described him-happened to be in conversation with him, when he observed that if three baUotboxes were put upon the table of the House, one for Lord DsnBY, one for Lord Jo- Rus!mn, and one for. Lord PAr.MxRSTOW, and Tories alone were to ballot, the last-named of the three statesmen would have " an immense majority." The " old friend" laughed at Sir JAmES and his speculation, but " did not deny it-not in the " least." But what follows, we should like to knowv, from this assumption ? Suppose we take it for granted, on the authority of Sir JAMES and his old Tory friend, that Lord PArMERSTON is the man for the Tories-what then? We can only say that he is beyond all doubt the man for the Liberals, for the Liberals acknowledged him as their heada and acted under his lead in the House of Commons against the opposite party under the lead of Mr. DissxxI. If he is, then, the man for all parties, we hardly see what better character need be given him. Nobody presumes that tho Liberals, if they were to go to this imaginary ballot, would choose Lord DERBY; so, if tho Tories like tho Liberal leader, and the Liberals like their own, Lord Ph.nSTOrro appears in a very enviable position.
Objections of this kind, as we have before remarked, should be made, not to the constituencies, bat to the Liberals themselves. We muat needs asppose that Parliamentary parties know what they are about, and that if Lord PAnLNxSToN heads one of them it is because he is thought the best man to do so bj those who are the best judges ofthe case. Sir J&TxEs tells us that his Lordship, if maintained in his present office, will give us just as little reform as he can, and that the Tories will give him all the support they can furnish with decency. If we were disposed to blink such a point, we might very readily remark that measures of reform on which all parties agree are pretty nearly as likely to be safe measures as those on which only one party is of accord; but we prefer to speak plainly, and to say that if this is the prospect before us the best course is evidently to supply Lord PAnUMRSTON with plenty of Liberal support. If his Lordship needs an impulse in this direction let him have it in the most effective shape. If, as Sir JArzs intimates, his policy will take a colour from that of the House, let the House itself be of a good Liberal constitution. There is now An excellent -chance bafoie {he country. With the Russian war ended, the Persian war ended, and the Chinese war. ended, there is ample room for domestic improvements and for vigilant manage. ment of the finances. Both parties just now seem to carry the same inscriptions on their banners. All alike, Sir JAMEs included, are for "peace, retrench" ment, and reform." The first of these blessings, we trust, we have obtained, and we devoutly hope we may preserve. The others are brought to a great extent under our command by this very fact, and in the efforts to realize them with security to the honour and institutions of the nation we shall soon see who best deserve the character of Liberals.

(CmOi OUR OWN 0ORUPONDIMT-1
(A portlon of the followilng appeared in our ftom.d dition of Saturday:-1
PARiS, x&nm 27, 6 P.M. The Moniteuv contains the following:-
"Several foreign journals, led awAy by party feeling, or deceived by rmalevolent correspondents, have represented the proceedings instituted against the Bishop of Moulins before the Council of State wa tho effect of political ranoour. It would be unworthy of the Government of gis Majesty t. iscuss sach insinuations, which are so contrary to its sentimients of moderation and good faith. The trath, w the whole of France knows, is that the prelate against whomn the proceedings have been directed for abuse of power has ex. cited in his dioeess by his impradent conduct the deepest antipathy, and has thus compromised both the interests of feligon and those of public order. The inhabitants of the department of the Allier have remonstrated against sach coadurt, and their representativos, the highest and the most honourable, have not hesitated to unite with them. The Emperor has himself received two petitions, silned by inorethaa 3,000 inhabitants of Moulins alone, and these documents attest the serious differences which exist between the bishop and his flock. The Government, in presence of sach serious complaints and such reprehensible acts, had to lulfil a duty of surveillance and protection. It has, therefore, made use of the only means of protesting which is sanctioned by the organic laws of France, at the *ame time that it has represented the state of things before the Holy See. It has acted without passion as well as without weaknoss."
I cannot say to what journals or to what correspondents the above alludes. For my own part, in noticing the matter in my letter of Sunday Last, I stated the grounds of complaint against the bishop, the alleged illegality of his acts, the certainty of his haying the great majority of the Council of State against him, and the probability of his being superseded. I do not think the vmperor has been in this affair actuated by any political feeling whatever towards M. de Dreux- Brez6. There are other prelates who are quite as Legitimist as he is, and who are not persecuted by the Government. The personal merits, the learning, the purity of morals, and the general benevolence of M. de Dreux-Brez6 are, I believe, admitted, but his temper is a difficult one to deal with, and his notions of church government are very high. Others could be pointed out, far inferior in professional sad nodal rank, in acquirements, in intellect as in worth, Who would play the tyrant if they dared. What these want in courage they make up for in intrigue. Mlt M. de Dreux-Brez6 has not the art to wear a frigidly placid smile on his lips while the gall of mortified vanity is at his heart. Others practise a system of mean and timid tyranny within their limited circle. M. de Dreux-Brezd is a despot, but he is a frank and open one. I think the Goverament has no alternative; the case has had every attention, and, I believe, much indulgence from the Government; but the monstrous pretensions of the Bishop to debar a man, because he is an ecclesiastic, from appealing against injustice, or to punish him for refusing to submit to it, with the system of forced resignation of benefices, even at the moment of appointment, could not be tolerated. There is little doubt of the Pope complying with the denand of the Emperor. I have already mentioned that His Majesty wrote to his Holiness to suggest that M. de Dreux-Breze should be caUed on to resign his see, as several other bishops have done, and among others the Bishops of Lucon and Amiens.
The Presse has received a warning (aver4issement) this afternoon for afeuiUeo published in its number of Wednesday last, caUed Daniella, written by the Well-known George Sand (Madame Dudevant), containing a " violent attack against the Sovereign Pontiff and his Government." On the other hand, the same writer has received a sharp reprimand from several Italian patriots on account of the insulting manner in which she has spoken of Italy and of Italians.
A letter from Rome of the 19th hist. informs us that a measure adopted by the Papal Government with respect to the college directed by the brothers of the Christian doctrine has created consideranble anxiety among the fathers of families in that city. By that measure, vhich withdraws the youth of the Roman States from their former teachers and commits them to the charge of the Jesuits, the rising generation is completely handed over to the members of that society, under the pretence that the brothers of the Christian doctrine are too liberal. It is expected, howrever, that as the interests of several Frenchl subjects are engaged and comprised by the measure, which deprives the college of its scholars, the French authorities will interfere to persuade the Government to retract its resolution. It is hoped likewise that General Guyon, the commander of the French garrison at Rome, will exert his great interest to prevent the resolution of the Roman, Government from being carried into effect. The Roman Council, it is said, is not at all satisfied with the news it has received from the provinces with respect to the effect produced everywhere by the publication of the diplomatic documents relative to the difference between the Austrian and Sardinian Governments. The ancent feelings of the inhabitants of the Roman States for Piedmont burst forth with new force on this occasion, and it is only natural that Cardinal Antonelli and his colleagues should be both indignant and alarmed
A letter from Venice of the 20th of March announces that the Austrian Government has commanded the municipal council to address a circular to the parish priest of each church in that city, informing him that the Govermnent, in order to preserve the paintings in the churches from damp, will remove them to the Imperial and Royal Academy, and that a copy of each painting shall be executed by skilful artists, and given to the churches in place of the originals. This circular, and the idea that their churches should be stripped of the chefs cZ'crwve of Titian and Paul Veronese, had created an immrnese sensation among the clergy. It is said that a refusal had been given to the circular, and that the demand will not be enforced.
A letter from Jassy of the 14th inst. announces that detachments of Moldavian troops marched on the 13th, with bands of music at their head, to take po&ession of the territory ceded by Russia to Moldavia. The passage of the Pruth commenced at 3 o'clock, and at 4 the troops were established on the new territory. This operation was performed in the presence of Russian functionaries in grand uniform. The Russian troops on the frontier had been withdrawn at 10 o'clock. The clergy chanted a Te Deam in the Rounian language on the great square of Reni.
The receipts of the Paris and Orleans Railway Company for the week ending the 18th of March amount to 1,182,497f. 74c., being an increase of 261,8856 31c. as compared with the corresponding week of last year.

Lord John Russell And The City Election.
ZORD JOHN BUSSELr ANrD THE CIlTY
ELECIzrON.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-A letter just received (Saturday, 9 p.m.) from Lord John Rsusell induces 'me again to trespass on your columns.
His Lordship says, in reply to an inquiry of mine, "Cer. tainly I told you ihat I was satisfied with your explana. tion " meaing, ua he says in another part of his letter, "that you had not shown my letter, or stated the substanco of it, to others?' and he adds, ' Am I omitted to make that statement in public, yon are at liberty to use this letter as You please."
Almost tho only comment I need make on this letter is that, being written, or sent, after the close of the poll, i: comes somewhat late as to its usefulness, but I accept it nevertheless; the rather as it has boen followed by another letter, in which his Lordship says, " I have not made, nor do I make, any charge against you of having actod treacherously towards me."
It may appear to some that too much importance has been attached to this question of the letter, and to the dharge of treachery as attaching to aa humble individual like myself.
I submit that it Is not so. A certain party deenly versed in the tricks and arts of electionoering succeeded in raising at the bustings " another issue," and in thus diverting the meeting altogethez from the important subject which really was at issue-namely, the merits and demerits of Lord John Russell as a statesman and representative.
Itwwasunderstood that,as the former proposr of LordJ-ohn RusseLL-when, as it hs beer said, feeble as my voicoe may be, I had made the stone walls of Guildhall ocho again with his merits and his praises, and had in the conclusion, amid a silence and attention suited to the cause and the occasion (rashly, perhaps, but certainly with sincerity), told him that, by our votes that day we were placing in hi hands "the destinies of a confiding people ;" so it was expected anu known that I should now venture to state, in his pre. senoe, why we, or some of us, had withdrawn from that favourable opinion of him, and doubted whether he had justified or fulfilled the "' confidence" we had formerly reposd in him.
It was, therefore, I cn well understand, deemed worth the while to rais a cry-it mattered not what-to prevent such n exposure, and the "cry". raised was that I, who was expected thus to speak, had " treacherously" revealed the existence of a oertain letter written to me by Lord John Russell, which I had "p promised not to show."
A more trumpery pretence, or one ioss suite or less equal to the gravity of the occasion, could scarcely have been raised; but it was raisod, and raised successfally, for the purposo intended; and the consequence was that of what I said on both, or either of the two subjects-(namely, the smaller subject of my own conduct as to the letter, or the larger and only important subject, of the merits or demerits of Lord John Russell's political conduct, not one single word was heard beyond the hustings, and not by many persons there.
Now, Sir, a few words, and only a few, filstly, as to Lord John Russell himself, and secondly, as to his adherents on the subject of this " cry" thus raised.
As to the first, I do not entertain for one moment the idea that Lord John Russell was privy to the raising this false charge of treachery on my part, but I must romark a, follows :-That on the day of nomination, turning from the noisy crowd, who were shouting their charge of " traitor," &c., I addressed myself, not merely, as has been said, to the reporters, but also to Lord John Russell himself, who stood near the reporters on that side of the hustings, and refuted the calumny by calmly and fully showing that not I, but his Lordship's ownmemsenger, had stated to parties con. nected with the election that he did not mean to stand, and had written to say so; that this explanation not only re. .eived, as I proceeded, nods of assent from his Lordship, but that, when I had finished, leaning over to me, he had said that "he was satisfied with my explana. tion," but that when almost immediately afterwards he ad. dressed the electors, while taking, as he did, the earliest opportinity of expressing " his great respect for Mr. Dillon," and although noticing at some length what on Other parts of the subject I had said and done, he did not say in publc one single word of that " satiwaction with my explanations" which he had a few minutes before expressed to me in private; that the storm of indignation against me, as guilty of "treachery" towards him, he allowed to rage on; and that not then only, but he left it to operate all the next day, the day of polling; and that he only admitted the falsehood of the charge, and sought to do do me justice by a letter written, or sent, after the closing of the poll; giving me, it is true, the liberty of "using that letter," thus tardily sent, " as I pleased" in my justification.
I now, Sir, in this my address to you, beg leavo so to use it and I do not purpose doing so in any other form.
The second part, the conduct of his Lordship's adherents, is alighter matter, and may be more briefly despatched.
They apparently took it for granted that I had shown the letters in question. With Lady Booby, they probably doubted the existence of virtue in man. They best knew the " plague of their own hearts," or the integrity of their own conduct; and

Nothing could have been more simple, or, as it seems to me, more natural than my course of conduct. It consisted of two parts-firstly, in making a promise; secondly, in keeping it.
According to their moral mathematics the demonstration asumed rather this form-
1. He has made a promise.
2. It is to the interests of his party not to keep that promise. Their conclusion, therefore, &c.-
It is, I believe, Rocbefoucault who says that we re as often oistaken in thinling men worse than they are than in thinidng them better.
A lady, to whom in the evening of the election day I briefly stated the case, exclaimed, characteristically enough, "Why, that conduct is not nice 1" A iman would have probably shted the same position in an affirmative instead of a negative form. I would have said what that conduct was, ratherthan what it was not.

The Saxon Church At Dover.
THE SAXON CHURCH AT DOVBBE
TO TE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Deeply sympathizing with the remonstrance of Mr. R. Snmth, which appeared in 2ie Tim, against the proposed demolition of one of our most ancient structures, allow me to occupy your valuable space with a few remarks on the subject. t seems certainly strango at the present day, when architecture and art are so generally encouraged and Government and other schools are being daily estabhshed for that purpose, that many of our. national antiquities are not only nearly entirely neglected, but in many cases apparently destroyed wit ont any ufficient reason whatever. It is, indeed, painful to think that the Saxon Church at Dover-a baiUding belonging to that eriod of which so few examples zemain, and which cannot fail to excite interest and pleasure in all intelligent Persons who visit it-should owe its preservation (should if be spared) entirely to the exertions of individutalzoealand right feelin ; and the publio willbe indebted. to Mr. R. Siht,shouledto have succeeded in awakening sufficient interest in the matter to induce the Government to abandon their design. I could say much more on this subject, but, hoping the attention of these who are in a positioni to interest themselves will be directed to it,
I am, Sir, your obedient servant.

The news from China and Persia this morning caused the funds to open firmly at an advatee of an eighth, at wlhich they were maintained withoat variation throughout the day, although the extent of business was unimportant. The comparatively favourable character of the Bank return likewise tended to give stability to the market, but there was no alteration in the rates for money. Bank Stock closed at 220 to 222 with dividend; India Stock, 222 to 224; Exchequer-bonds, 981 to i; India Bonds, 5s. discount to par; and Exchequerbills (March), par to &. prenuum.
Foreign stocks were dealt in only to a moderate extent. Turksh was fairly maintained, but did not close at the highest prices. IntheSixperCents. the transactions for money were at 981 and 1, and for the account at 99ik i, and 98g. The Four pr Cents. Guaranteed were negotiated at 101. I'he other business comprised-Braziian Five per Cents., 102; Mexican Three per Cents., 22k, ;, and I; Portuguese Three per Cents., 456 an 45k; Rusian Four-and*a-Ralf per Cents., 96; Belgian Two-anda-Half per Cents, 55; the Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 98X; andDatchFourper Cent. Certificates, 99i and 99.
The final prices of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 70f. 45c. for money and 70f. 60c. for the account, showing in the former case an advance of an eighth. At Vienna, owing to the recent rupture of diplomatic relations with Sardinia, the market manifests heaviness.
About 40,0001. in bar gold was taken from the Bank to-day. During the next week, owing to the p reparations for the India Mail, the demand is likely to increase, but several vessels from Australia are now fully due, and La Plata, from the West Indies and Mexico, may be expected on Wednesday.
The tea market was disturbed to-day by the telegraphic intelligence, and it would have been difficult to transact any extensive business. A few small Wales were effected of common Congou at Is. per lb., being a; decline of Id.
Thehalf-yearly meetigs of railways may now be considered to have terminated, and those during the past week have included few of importance. The Portsmouth Railway meeting waa adjourned through an insufficient attendance of shareholders. The report of the Scottish North-Eastern Company has been adopted, together with the dividend. The position and prospects of the line are con. sidered satisfactory. At the meeting of the Limerick and Foynes Company it was stated that the traffic on the route opened between Limerick and Ratlkeale shows favourable results, aud that a further portion to Askeaton will be opened in a few weeks. The shareholders of the Chester and Holyhead CompaDy have agreed to the report, and have sanctioned a dividend at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum on the first preference shares. It has also been determined to make a distribution at therate of 5 per cent. on the second preference shares for 12 months, on account of arrears of interest due prior to October, 1856. The directors of the Scottish Central recommend a dividend at the 'rate of 5E per cent., less income-tax, leaving a balance of 1,4M88. to be carried forward. According to the report of the Dublin and ingstown Railway, the dividend will be 4 per cent. for the half-year, free of income-tax. The alteration of the gauge is being rapidly proceeded with, and when uniformity is established throughout an increase in the traffic i
anticipated. The dividend of the Midland Great Western Railway will be at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum, leaving 2,6781. to the cmedit of the next six months. The report of the Edinburgh, Perth, and Dundee Company has been confiemed; the Einros and Leslie working agreements have been approved}, and the directors have been authorized to convert debenture loans into debenture stock.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-The object of your correspndent " B.A.,' in yes. terday's journal, touching " witchcraft' and the Bible, Is I think, not wise. However, as the writer asks for a "plain answer" to his-remarks, MAY I Tenture to attempt to give one? The power wizards did poses "BA.' Bayg, is seen ini the ease of the " Witch of Edo.r." Surely be has not carefull1v read the chapter - if he had how could he fall. Into seci an error? For, instead of slowing the power, it elearly shows the want of it; for she did not know the king when he applied& to her, hence she exclaims, in her fright when she saw Samuxel (12th verse) "1Why hast thoux deceived me? for thou art Saul." This witch had so much 11pm;"or rather so little, sbe was deceived. Then, as to her "rfaising the spirit of Samuisl"-.it is very evident that the woman only intendlecl to deceive Saul by her "1enchant. ments," for the Almighty suffered Samuel himself to ap. peadrtotega alarm of the wizard. "1She cried with a
ou vooe~-thatit was in alarm is clear, for the King said, 611ontafraid." That Samuel himself appeare and was sent. by the Lordl may also be proved by~ t;he three prophecies delivered by hu and so completel fufle 17th vers) :-L1. "The Lord bath rent the ldDgdonm out of thina hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to David *` a second, that the Lord would deliver Saul and the Israeit-es into the bautd of the Philistines (v. 19) ; and a third, that the very next day Saul and his sons would be dead ; this sad and solemn event is recorded in chi. 31, v. 6-"1 So Saul died and his three sons, and his armour bearer, and all his men that same day together." And it ismost important to observe a-s declared in 1st Chron. ch. 10, v. 13, that asking coi~nsel of this witch of Endor is given as one of the reasons why he was killed. " So Saul died for, &c.; asfo snicounsel of one tha had a familiar spirit to jWroof. it. I rcannot suppose "1B. A." in stating the "ible recognizes" means to intimaate the Bible approves of witchcraft and such like; the Bible states truly what occurred, buLt everywhere declares the Almighty's anger against witches~, wizards, and such like.

Sir,-About a week ago I was called to see a healthy. looking, well-fed boy, five years of age, hbonring under ulceration of the tongue and soft palate, fetid breath, intense salivation, colicky pains of the abdomen, and other unmistakeable symptomg ot poisoning by apreparation of mercury. I was aIso strongly impressed with the white appearance of the gums, so distingishing tom in mercurial poisoning. The parents could give no explanation of the circumstances, and would not believe that the isptoms were produced by any other than natural cause. R have sin,e learned that the insides of the indiaYabber balloons sold in the streets are coloared by various mineral preparations, and that for two or tbreo days before the child's symptoms appeared ho was endenvotring to inflate nenof these collapsed toys; hence, doubtless, the source of ghepoison.

This was an action for breach of promise of marriage.
Mr. dawin James, Q.C., and Mr. Brett appeared for the plaintiff; Mr. Attorney-General Knowlea and Mr. R-afles for the defendant.
Yr. JAS, in opening the case for the plaintiff, said, the plainti Kiss Maria Hutchinson, a young lady 28 or 29 years of age, was the daughter of a late supervisor of excise, residing at Bromborough, in the county of Chester. At her A6her's death, in 1853, she went to reside with Mrs. Jone4 landlady of tlo Sportsman's Axms publichouse at Brosn-borough. The defendant was a rope manufacturer, but .retired from bsxiness, residing at New Ferry, and being in
the habit of calling at the Sportsman's Arms he had been sEmitteu with tho charms of the plaintig, to *9hom he comn. maenced paying his addresses in March last year, often :walking out with her, and showing her the general attention of a lover, ibis being approveda of by her brother and frieuds. Affairs proceeded in such a satisfactory manner with the lovers that inx the mosth of May he bought the wedding ring, and in the presence of her brother and several friends announcedthe forthcoming marriage, which was fixed to take place on the 31st of July. The dresses were bought, the nrxriage license was procured, a houe was examined in order to be repaired as the future abode of the happy couple, the wedding breakfast was ordered, and every preparation ,made for the auspicious event, when, just at the last moment, the defendant alteredhis mind. On the evening of theS3oth of July-the night before the intended marriage-he sent his solicitor, Mr. Conway, to the plaintiff, to inform her s tbathe had changed his miad. The w/edding being thus so
ulddenly and etrangely prevented, the brother called upon the defendent to inquire the reasons for such unaccountable conduc, hut the or,ly answer he cou]d get was that, though he loved his sister MEria very dearly, be had heard that of herchuarater which iduced binito break it off, for hevwas sU"e they could never be happy after what he had heard. Be would not further explam himself, nor give u the authors of his information; but from thistine, saidthe lexrned counsel, he continued to promlgate the most atrooiota-landers respecting the lady, until, on the 14th of NovemBr)ast, the plaintiff's attorney sent him a letter, threatening that if he did not retract the calumnies an action would be conmenced against him for slander, in addition to the present action for breach of promise. These calumnies were without the slightest fourndation whatever, and he (Mr. James) dared him to come into court and repeat the asper sions he had cast upon her. The learned counsel concluded his address by an eloquent appeal to the jury to give such ample damages as would, ina some measure, compensate the plaintiff for the wanton injuries inflicted upon her.
Thomas James Hutchinson, examined.-Re was the brother of the plaintiff, and an architect, residing at Birkenhead. He knew the defendant, who was living at Bromborough, retired from business. On the 3d of March, 1856, the defendant came to witneWss bouse at IBirkenhead in company with his sister. ie often sawy them together after that. On the 15th of May they were at tea at his house, and the defendant said, " Well, Tom, l've made sure of your sister Maria." Witnes; said, "In what way 92" Defendant said to his sister, " Show Tom what I've been purchasing," and she produced the wedding ring, he saying, "Now, if she should run in, I shall bave an action for breach of promise." ,Laughter.) Another day witness went to Bebington with the defendant to look at some property-a
farmhouse and land, the value of which he should estimate, at about 2,0001. Defendant asked his opinionresmecting the. value of the land, s he intended turning it inato building land, by which he thought he could make it worth 4,0001. Witness afterwards visited Bebington churchyard, where
defendant pointed out his daughter's grave, saying if, after I their mroriage, his wife shoudd die first, he should bury' her there. (A laugh.) At another time, when they came to take tea at witnesss boisse, defendant said, "Come, take off your bonnet, Mrs. Conroy." She answered, "1 as not Mrs. Conroy." le then said, " Well if you are not now, you will very icon be so, Mrs. Conroy, or there will be an action for breach." (Laughter.) On the 27th of June the wife of witness asked him when the marriage was to take place, and he said, 1 I have told Maria, and I daxe say she has told you," afterwards mentioning the 31st of July as the bappy day. On the 28th, three days before the intended marriage, defendant came to witness with two wedding waistepats to be made up forthwith. In the evening of the same day he went to LIve,rool with him, to the surrogate's to procure the marriaue license, and afterwards to his house at New Ferry. At 10 eoclock, when 'witness 'wasttig his leave, the defendant said, " Give my love to Mria; tell her I shall be sure to be there on Wednesday, but if not, then on Thursday, in time for the wedding.' Witness did not again see the defendant until the 2d of August, when he went to his house at New Perry to ask the reason of his conduct. He said, " I love Maria dearly, but I've heard that of her oharscter that if I.bad been married I should never have been happy." Witbess then asked him to explain what it was, and at first he said he would. Witness then asked him to go to the arties who had told him, butlie said, "No, I won't go. Witness then said he would know what it was, and defendant made answer, "I know I am in your power for wbat I have done, and if it is money you want youn shall have aU I am worth." On the afternoon of the same day he went to Mrm Joness, at Bromnborough, where he again met the defendant, who rnade use of the same expressions as be had done in the mnorning, stiUl refusing to give the nautes of his informants unless compelled. The plainti bad lived with Ms. Jones since her father's death. Mfrs. Jones was a widow, and had no daughter of ler own.
Cross-examined by Mr. EKuoNvTxS.-Is that handsome waistcoat thatIseo you have on the wedding waistcoat spoken so mauch of ?
Witness.-I believe it is, Sir. iLsughter.)
Mr. Kxowixs.-Oh, it's come in at last, then.
Witness, in continuation.-The defendar,t was about S0 years of age. He was a widower, retired from the pursuit of making ropes. His sister was 3iving at the Sportsman's Arm, not exactly as barmaid. Did Dot think it the fact that when defendant caled for his glass of gin-and-water she stirred it pretty strong, so that from being warm be got fuddled, and got from bad to worse, till at last he fell in love. Could not say whether rbe had ever been engaged before; knew sbe was not now. (Laughter.) It was lz months ago since she was courted by a mr. E.llis, It vw on the 30th of March that he first heard of the enga,gement. When defendant said "Tom, rve mnade sure of your sister," his sister did not reply " Sartin sUre" (laughter), but he (witness) thought they might have got marred unknown to bim, and therefore said "In what 'way ?" (Rears of laughter.) It was in May that defendant began to talk about "breaches of promise." Was not aware that he had a mania for "breaches." The land at Bebington was about nine acres; defendant said he could make
,0001. of it by building upon it. Had nvcxer seen him the worse fordrink. 'When they vi4ited the churchyard defendant said " I have not got y first wife there, but I hope to have my second with ne." ULaughter.) TMr. X-Nowms-Then, contrary to the poet, who says "From zato t y, &e.," he went from gay to the grave ? (Laugghter).] wiltuess was a married man, and was not to be the groomsman; he was to give his sister away. He thought the defendant could, but would not, tell who the parties were that circulated the rumours abouat his sister.
Mlrs. Sarah Jane Hutchinson, wife of the last witness, said, she had heard the evidence her husband had given, and she could corroborate it in nearly every particular. She often saw the plaintiff and defendant together, and they aprazed very loving and affectionate. EHe was not in the
abut of getig drunk, at least when she .ai him. Rocollected Mr. Conway, the defendant's solicitor, calling on the 30th of July-the night before the weddiug.day. Soe said to the plaintiff that the defendant would not come, as he bad altered his mind; that she liad better go and see him, and try to compromise the matter.
By Mr. XNOWLiis.-The plaintiff had told her recently that she had heard that the defendant was dangerously ill She (witness) haa once said she thought it was a good thing that her sister-in-lavm had escaped the marriage; but it was after this action was commlenced. (Laughter,)
bIrs. MIary Jones said, she hved at Bromrborough, and kept a publichouse there, called the Sportsman's Arms. llad knovn the plaintiffall her life. Se hal beenrwith her nearly 14 years, and had lived wiD' her since her father's death, in 1853. She left in July mn order to be rmarried. Had often seen the defendant in company with the plaintiff at her house, and he seemed very fond of her, Plaintiff stopped with her as a companion, not as a barmaid, and was not paid wages like a barmaid.
Cross-examined by Mnr.KNowLEs-She o0casionallyasmisted ithe bar, and witness often made her presents. Had known fr. Conroy about two years. le often came in to have a drop at the bar. Plaintiff did not alays him his gin-and-water, nor did the plaintiff "stir it up s gfor him." (LAughter.) She was a widow herself, and ocourse knew all about love affairs. (Continued laughter.)
Re-examined by Mr. JA,sss.-There is no foundation for the supposition that all the love-making took place when he was in drink. Very seldoun sa'w hirm the worse for liquor.
Mr. Ellis, fanner, of Bromborough, bad known the plaintiff for the last 20 years, and the defendant for the last our years. In June, 1854, witness attended a sale in Chester, where the defendant purchased several lots of land, situate at Bebiagton. Thought he paid about 1,5001. or 1,6001. for them. Believed the defendant to be in good circunistances, and he was apparently well off,
Cross-examined by Mr.- A owLE.-He keeps one servant. Did not know that the land at Bebington was mortgaged.
MIark Lowe said he was a servant of the defendatt who r.ented asbop inILond0n-road, at 401. a-year,
Cross-exalnined by Mr. XiowLxS.-Di& not Inow that the Shop was mortgaged.
Mr. JEshaving summed up,
Mr. Attorney-General XKYowrzs addressed the jury for the defence. He said, his learned friend had appealed to their feelings with regard to the alleged scandalous reports about the young lady, but he must remind them that it was not the defendant whobroughttheseslanders into that court -it was the plaintiff's own friends, and it was themselves alone they had to thank for the publicity then given to them. But to dispose of this romancing case as well as he could. Who 'were the parties? The plaintiff was iling the very respectable situation of barmaid at the Sportsman's Arms, and although his learned friend had tried to conceal that fact, ho (Mr. Knowles) did not think that a reproach. The defendant was a retired roperaaker-it would be much4l better if he never had retired, apparently-and feeling lonely in his house at New Ferry had been induced to drop in at Mrs. Jones's for tho comfort of a glass, and there he had becoie charmed with the oarmaid, who mnixed him his drop of *-and-'water, sweetening it with the fascination of. her eanner, till at last, poor fello, he fell in love, and then be begun to be uder a "breaching" mania-though it ould hsavo beeut well for him never to have talked asout "b broaches" at all ; for it had como to pass in his individual case. It is really not wonderful tt:at while the handsome barmaid was stirring up his glass be should have hecome fuddled, and bo a little ax'rous, ard so he felt into the temptation-tbough he had better bave made a rope fur himself. (Laughter.) The learned counsel drew atten.

LIVERPOOL, MARACH 28.
CROWN COURT.-Before Mr. Baron MARTIN.)
Henry Cabling, John Lewis, and John Caawell (notin custody) were indicted for the manslaughter of a man named. George. A second count charged the prisoners with the manslaughter of a person unknown.
Tne circumstances of this case were not only of a very melancholv character, but were also remarkable, inasmuch as they raised a nice question as to the jurisdiction of thd Court. The deceased, who was a foreigner, had died two da-. after the vessel reahed the port of Liverpool, bht tho blows and iltreatment which bad caused his death had been inflicted by the prisoners (two of whom were Americans) on board of an American vessel carying an American flag, and upon,the high seas. A cese, similar in some xespects, was tried here before the same learned judge at the spring a'sfe of 186, upon a verdict of manslaughter which had been returned Dy a coroner's jury against an American named Conolly, for killing a seaman (a subject of Great Britain) on board an American ship, ai, in consequence of some doubt expressed by his Lordehip at the trial as to the 'uia' diction, au orrespondenee which had taken place with beth Secretary of State and the law offlcers of the CrownnI read, the subsance of which was that they were of opithe on that Conolly was liable to be tied in this country on a charge of manslaughter, and that he ought not to be delivered up to the Aomerican CODnsU for the fol'sowing reasons-

The tril of Conolly ultimately proceeded, and the prisoner was found guilty; but, owing to some unusually miitigating circumstances, the prisoner, after undergoing a very alght sentence, was dischareed
Mr. Aspinwall andlr. Preston appeared for the proseontion, and Mr. Monk defended Catlig ; the other prisoner Lewis was unidefended.
The learned CoUsrsx, in opening the case, stated tat the prisoners were indicted in that court under the authority of the 8th section of the 9th of George IV., cha 31, and it appearedthat the deceasedha shipped at ITew ork on the 21st of Decomberlastas anordinry seamanonboardtheIny Mannering, of which John COswell was second mate. Henry Catling third mate, and John Lewis boatswain. The GUV blannering wasanAnerica nvessel, and bound for Liverpool5 and within a day or two after the vestel had uiled the two prisoners at the bar and the second mate comenced a system of continued asults and ill troatment tordr&s 'the nfortunate deceased, particularly Lewis. Sometimes the poor lad was beaten over the head and body with ropes and belaying pins, at other times he was kicked upon the hLad and face, and dragged out of his berth, and upon one occasion his legs and feet had become so swollen that it became necessary to cut off his boots. This state of thinTs lated until the arrival of the vessel, when the deceased wag sO helplems and ill that he could scarcely see or walJ, and two days after his arrival in Liverpool he was taken to the hospital, where le died three hours -afer his admission. Hee was a healthy young man about 18 years old, at the tiine he shipped. It a
peared that Caswell, the second mate, had been mainly instrumental in promoting the death of the deceased, the other two, particularly the boatswain, having acted under his express directions; and upon Mr. Monk submitting that the evidence was insufficient to support the charge agains his client,
His LORDSHIP directed an Acquital.
Some further evidence was then offered, ending with that of the surgeon to the hospital, who described the dying state of the deceased man at the time he wras brought in. His bead and face were greatly swollen, the parts about the nose livid and in a state of mortification, various contusions on the scalp, and the brain mnch congested; the legs and thighs were contused and wounded in several places. The head, body, and legs presented one mass of contused wounds and bruises; the organs of the chest and abdomen being
The learned JIUDGE, in summing up, said,-This case involves rather a serious question of law. The acts which form the subject of this indictment were done by the pni. soner onboard anAmerican ship on the high seas andagainst a person who was not a British subject; the prisoner, aso, though a Frenchman by birth, is a citizen of the United States. I consider it very important that the law should be settled, and, as I have considerable doubt on my mind as to the jurisdiction of this Court, I shall take the opinion of the Criminal Court of AppeaL I had a somewhat smilar case before me here last year. In that case the prisoner was a'lou
American, but the deceased was a,British subject. It is' necessary that I should do this, for I am bound to' see that thelawIs properly administered. N-ow, manslaughter is nn unlawful M-ng of another, and the question for you Is whether the acts of thepersons accused caused the decesd'
death. If the acts of the prisoner,though even he were forced by others, caused the death, he is guilty of manslaghter; and I need not say-even assuming that the deceased man did refuse to obey the orders of the second mate-it was no excuse for iss corduct in point of law. The command being unlawful, no directions frioa a superior ofricer would justif
the prisoner, though it would undoubtedly make a difference as to the punishment whether the prisoner did these acts of his own free will, arising from violence aud ill-blood, or under the direction of another.
The ury immediately found the prisoner 0sflt.
His =osias', addressing the prisoner, «aid,-The jury have found you guilty of manslaughter, and I quite concur in that verdict. It is quite clear that your acts contributed partly towards the death of the deceased bov, but it is right that I should tell you that I have great donut whether you can be indicted ned tried by an English Court I wi uwon the firt opportunity take the opinion of a Court, consst= of at least five judges, upon the construction of the Act o Parliament, and you shall have the benefit of it. I can enter into the difficulty in which a man is placed who is acting under the orders of a superior offiecer, and, If the second mate had been here and found guiltv, I should haae felt it my duty to inflict the severest punishment uponhimn which the law allows, and I wish all persons in this court to hear mne.

rehorted to the coroner t_ab they ba discovered extenrive hn3uriesin the person of te deceased, q which, i their oninion, accounted for death; but they did not exctendt heir
Oamination beyond the parts oE generationt when edhined today, they stated that under the circomstances of the c rso tne use of instr unents was nnadvissble, and that in their opinton the prisoner had used themin grosl;unskslfut way, or he never could haveprouce thesnjiie inquestion.
On the paft of the prisoner it was contended that this charg had originated in profesrdonal jealous, crested by his having absorbed almost all the practice of the vicinity; that he had, as was admitted by the friends of the deceased, been tender and attentive Sn his treatment of her; that there were great difculties in the confinement,which rendered the use of the instruments an absolute necessity; and that the injuries spoken to, if they existed to the extent detailed by the prejudiced witne6ses, were 'attributable to accident for which the prisoner ought, not to be held rensile. 3tuoh stress was alsq aid on the fact tbat the examination was not extended to the whole body, and that the prisoner had not been called upon to be present in person or by a friend at tho post morten eamination, so as to explain the case to the witnesses; and the jary were calledu on to infer that he had discharged his duty to the decea edwith great sldll nd care rom the fact tbat'he bh
attenaed upwards of 200 women In their confinement during is residence at Lowestoft And lsewhere, and had never before met with one fatal case. The learned counsel proposed to prove the latter fact by calling many of his client's patients, but
The CBns BARox refused to allow such evidence to be gone into under the head of ' witnesses to character," atd the case then went to thb juiy on the evidence adduoed for the prosecution. In the courseof hisobservationsthe learned judge stated that, though the prisoner was not quaified by any Engish diplom le appeared to hxve had a considerable practoe, and, according to his own statcment, possess a diploma from Now York; but whether that were so or not he ws entitled to be present at the examination of the body, and heconceived that it was the duty of the gentlemen who conducted it to give hirn the opprtunity of witnessitn thlt operation, on wbich so much depended. In his opinion, great itjury would ensue both to tho public and to the medical profession if, when a medical muan entered sick roor and met with a diffcult case, he was to exercise his art under the apprehension of a charge of manslaughter if tho case should take a fatal tur. However, the law was clear that no maan, whether qualified or mo, ought to undertake the responsible tAsk of a medical practitioner without brn' to its discharge competent skil and ability, and if he displayed growe ignorance, or exercised his profession with gross.want of skill, and death ensued from such, he would be liable to the charge of manslaughter. The question, therefore, was whether thejury thought the psoner had so undifully conducted himsef
as to cause the inju to the extent deposed tobr tho medical witnesses *and, if o, whether that injury ha producedihe death t ththen they ought to fnd hnmguity; but, if they doubted the partial observafions made under the circomstacesad the opinions founded on them, or thought that the injuriesmight oe attributable to accdent, or had not, however caused, produced death, tbe prisoner wsu enfftled io an acq~uittsl.
mhe jury>, after a, brief deliberation, returned a verdict of i'fGuit~ w-r,vhich wvas received withl evident satisfaction by a crowded court, the inqursy having created a great sensatSuin in the county.

This was an indictment preferred by the Corporation of the City of London against the defendant, Mr. Hawhin, who is the cbsirman, and other responsible oficers, oL the London Gas CornPsny, for a nuisance
Mr. E. James, Q.C., Mr. Bodin, EMr. Lush, and Mr. Sharpe appeared on behalf of the corporatio4 to conduct the prosecutioni M. Sereant Ballantine and Mr. Bushby appeared for tne defendants.
Mr. }D. xs, iao o ning the case, said that the Corporation of the City of Lndon had felt it their duty as conEervatOrs of the river Thawnes to instituto the present proceedings against the defendants in order to put a atop to a nisance of the moot serious character, and one that was calculated most materially to affect the lives and health of the pubhc. The defendants represented the London Gasworks, and thbey bad a large establishmentst Vauxhall- said, what was complained of them was, tbat theyv caus -the refuse matter from the gas to be thrown nto the river opposite their works. He need hardly inform the ixry tb gat s refuso was of the most digusting description It was known by persons connected with the trade by the o ogomen of 'blue billy," and it appeared that it evolvea a gas known among aientil persons as "sulphuretted hydrogen," which, he..beieved, was the most deleterious to human Iffe, ald of the most offensive character. The defendants aspeared to be perfectly well aware that they bad no right to dispoe of the refuso from the works in this manner, as they adopted a very ingenions proceeding with a 'iew to prevent it from being known that the oufensive matter came from their works, and instead of casting it into theriver openly, they contrived bynmeans of a six-inch iron pipe to cozsuay the refuse matter into the middle of the river, where it WscaSt out by means of a steam engme and fiied with the water. The city authorities, ho,wever, were not to bo so easily dJeceived, and, snseDting that there was something wrong bout theuse of thspipe, they sent a barge wifh hose and ttached the hose to the pipo; the bargewasmoored near the lpot, and the persons employed for the purpose quietly awraited the result. They had not remained long, however, before the operation commenced, and the refse, of conrse, insteadi of going into the river, came into the br6e; and It was then directly seenwhat had been going on, and the present prosecution was the result; the object of the corporation being, of course, only to bate what they considered to be a very dangerous nuisance.
Mr. Serieant BALLA2ni, when Mr. James had concluded, addressedatheCot, nd said that there was no desire on the of the co;mpany whomhe had the hononr to repreeent to oppose the present proceeding, which he admitted was a very proper one, with a view to prevent the pollution of the river; and the company were remAy to do al in their power to effect the object. He begged at the same tinae to state that, although the defendant, Mr.
fawkins, was no doubt legally responsible in his podtion as chairman of the company, yet that he was known a6 a gentleman of high respectability and a member of their profession, and he knew nothing whatever of the iroceeding com. plairned of, and the moment it was bronghti his kaowledge h e ordered it to be discontinned. The companywere now making arrangements to remove an their efnuse matter to a distance, and had incurred great expense with that object and were ready to do everythng tat wa necessary to efeci it. A plea of " guilty" might erefore, be takenaa to some oDf the defendants and they would etrit n recog.
izances that migit be required as a securtity thatthe nuisace complained of should be discontinued.
Mr. Jozs consented to this course on the part of the corporation, ad a plea of "Guilty" 'was accordingly taken against the chairman and the engineer of the comnany, and recogmzanss wvere entered into by them for the carrying out the object of the prosecution.
This case concluded the business of the assizes.

At Yolbrook, near Ipswich, t ere lives a gentleman named laker, who, having been surcharged in respect of .:is income-tax, had appealed to the commissionert, and was in tpe month of August ast in daily expectation of re:eiTin1g An offical commu1nicAtion on the subject. It being his hiolt to send to the Holbrook Post-offce, which was keptby the prisoner, his servant on the day nsmed in the inuictment iwvt in as usual and received from thei prisoner one letter adaressed to a ldy residing with her 2naster. On her as] ng -whether that was all, the prisoner satd that there was nO other letter, and she went away. In the house of the prisoner, who had recently lost his wife lived a woman named lAvin, who acted As his friend and companion, as well as eook and housekeeper, having been a odgerduring his wife's lifetime. On this morning Mrs. mvin aso expected a letter, and As she was abost to open the door which communicsted between the parlour and shop in which the post-olice was, in order to ask for her lettcr, she thought phe heard some one in the thop, and, peep.ing through a hole in the door, saw hEr. Laker's servAnt receive her letter. Not likingto intrade, Mrs. Elvinreired, and after a few moments returned to the door, which, ss she .zaid, "to make saue no one was there," she Again peeped through. She then saw the prisoner alone with a large letter in his hand, which, after examining, he breathed' upon, and then attempted to open by app1ying his finger ,and next an old rasorto the wafer. After this operation he
iut the letter aide Into an opn box on , shelf, And immefiately atterhe went out to delivcr the letterstoanch persons s did not send for their lettcrs from whom he would be entitled to receive Id. per letter for delivery, As soon as the prisoner left the shop Mrs. Elvin went to the box, hoping, as the sid, that he had taken the letter to be delivered, but she was disappointed in her charitable construction, as there was the letter nearly but not quite opened. Alarmed at this fact, mrs. Elvin replaced the letter, andin sn hour the prisoner returned, changed his dress, and shortly after went out again on his private business as usual. At this time the letter was gone from, the box, but Mrs. Elvin, on going into the prisoners bedroom to clean it, saw the cat he had takeno on a chair, nd the letterpeeping outof its pocket. Having examined it Again, and Aseertained that it was then quite torn opcn at the wafer, she replaced it, and being much disturbed in her mnind made known the above factsto a friend named Block, who came in. The two ladies then proceeded to the bedroom and opened the letter, vhich was a printed- form, announcing that the sum of 51. Os. 5d. would oe paid to Mr. LAker by the incorae-tax col lector at Ipewich on the presentation of that letter. The secret thus divuald to Mrs. Block soon found its wsy alU over the village, and ultimately reached the ears of 3r. Laker's servant, who sent for a policeman. Accordingly About an hour ftier the returnof the risoner he was visited by the offcer with s demand 'for er. Laker's letter, which bid corae that day from Somerset-house. The prisoner Aenied having any such letter, ancd going to a shelf took something from it, with which lie nitted the shop and went up a ladder to his lailors' vorkroom. The policeman kept close at his heels, and when they had both fasended the officer discovered in the prisoner's haid a box of lucifer matches, upon which he said, You have the letter about you now, And were going toburnit. Giveitte atono'ndproceeded to seah him. The reslt of this step was that the missing letter was found in the prisoner's coat pocket; and on i't production all he saigi-as, "Itfcame asit is. Iintended to seal and deliver it." The only other circuwmstanceworth recordingin this remarkable case was, thatthe poor old man, who was tried on his birthday, had kept the post-office for 17 rears, at a salary of 41. per annumu, and that during all that IOng p todber bad never been made any com plaint whatever of she slightest Iregrity in the dischwarg of that
Thejury having found the prisoner Guriy of secreting the letter,
Mr. Justice ERVIs said that, in.cousideration of the prisoners a and character, he felt justified in departingfrom the usual rule in. sch Ces. The law advitted of a sen. tence of transportasion for life, but he thought the ends of justice would be met bya lighter punishment.
The prisoner was thereupon sentenced to 18 mnonth? imaprisonment.

William Ward and Edward Mortimer were indicted for ighipoaching In the " Great Wood" at aindlesbam.
Vr. Dasent conducted the case for the prosectution; Mr. Iillsapearedfor the prisoners.
The history of this trial is a not a little singular. The ase was taken on Thursday at the close of the day, when it wasad4journed. On Friday morninz a surgeon deposed that On"Of the JMmen was 3xd4eilyt4 en ill and would not be able, in al probabllity, to attend again during the asizes. The case was, however, adjourned again, in the hope that the absent juror might attend, and in the meantime it wa propos that, the ease having been pToved with suffident certainty against both the prisoners, a path out of the dilemma should be opened by the prisoners pleading guilty and the prosecator forbearing frompressing for punishment. A difficty, hover, existed, inasuiuch as the solicitor for the prosecution in the absence of his client would not take upon himself to esaction this arxangement, seo matters stood until the business of the assires was approaching an end to-
TXheC BArolO, referring to the case, inquired whether the prisoners were desirous of withdrawing their plea?
Mr. IlEl).-Yes, my Lord; they are.

Mr. flsrtXr hopd It was quite understood that his cient did not give hs assent to this eentence. For himself lr. Dasent), appeing for the prosecution, it was enough, mn his opinion, that the prisoners should plead guilty. With regardt,o the sentence, that must of course rest in the discretion of the Court.
The CH= BARto.-No doubt. ladopt this course, under thepeculir circumstances of the case, as the best which can he taken, and that which is most likely to attain the obect of the ,arosecation. I think the prisoners are far less skely to engeagcaiu in powhing when they may be called upon to receive wsenoec Zor tthis conviction thsm they would be if I were to send them to prison for a short time on the expiration of that sentenCe. That sentence ought under any circumstances to' be light, I am of opinion, as there was not any violence whatever offered to the keepers. His Lordship then admonished the prisoners to be cautious in future, and not to emabarlk in. any poaching again, and they were therupon discharged on their own recogsiance of Iuot, each.

The prisoner was the captain of a vessel called the Mas, which sailed from Dundee on the 5th of April. She put into Lowestoft on the 30th of May, when some of her men deserted. The captain then took in other men and the deceased, who was cabin boy. The crew consisted of the captain and six men and the boy, who was about 14 yeas of age, The vessel ailed frora Lowestoft aDd went to a post on the coast of Cuba, 'where she took ina a cargo of rum, and after that time the captain commenoed beatinm and ill-nsing the boy until the 27th of October, when he beat the 'boy several times. He had been getting weaker and weaker, and on that day he was asisted into his berth, and the next morning he was found dead, cold, andstiff. The body then presented s mostshocking and dreadful appearance; it was aush discoloared, and there were the marks of atripes and blowa. The captain, when informed of the death, manifested great indifference but the feelings of the crew were so excited that immediAtely on the arrival of the versel in Penzance biarbour, into wbich she put from stress of weather, they gave information of the conduct of the captain, which led to an inquiry and to the committal of tho prisoner to take his trial for the murder of the bo. The following evidence was adduced:-

Mr. COLXRIDGE then addressed the Jury with great force and with hisxaccustomed eloquence in liebsI of the pri. soner. He would ask them what p art of the evidenc e in ani way approached thedefiaition of the offence of murder, as laid down by the greatest writers on the aubject who ha
ever lived. The question, was this, whether the death of tbe poor boy was cauedhby the acts'and by the beatinzr uf the prisoner, unlawfully performed, or if t'he 'boy dlied of a disease the production of which the prisner had nothing to do -with. The learned counsel then contended that the boy ha the seurty, anid that the acts of the prIsoner had not in any 'way conduced to the death of the deceased.
Mr. Tustice WmuIAw)s, in his saminxnin up, told the jury that if the acts of the prsner, bIn nilwel ase h death of the boy one KayMo one hour earlier than it would otherwise have taken place, the prisoner was responsible.

On the arrival of the train at London-bridge the prisonerwas found in a second-class carTiage, and, answering the description forwarded by telegraph, he was banded over to police-constable 276 X, who brought him to the stationhouse. Witness bemig in the inspector's room at the timn, in conjunction with inspector Mackenzie, he took a key from the prisoner's pocket, which unlocked the travelling bag; and on opening it he discovered the property mentioned n the charge-sheet, which was -valqea in English morney at 3831. 4s. ld. As soon as M.

The earnest and gracious desire expressed by Her Majesty to preserve and -dvanoe upon all occasions the interest and bappiness of England and America, snd the heaty good wishes 'vhich Her Majesty cherishes for the prosperity of the United Stater, are cordially reciproeated on my part, and will elicit an enthusiastic response from the hearts of the American people. No independent Powers have ever been bound together by material interests of sucx magnF tude as those whvich unite Great Britain and the United States. Indeed, the prosperity of the one is nearily involved in that of tho other; but mutual interests, however vas, without mutual regard, are not always suffi. cient to preserve friendship betwoen nations. How happy, then, am I to receive the assurances that your Sovereign, lier Ministers, and every order of her subjects are animated by sentiments of benevolence towards the Government and lseople of the United States. During my Administration it shall be my agreeable duty, as well as my earnest desire, to increase the friendship and mutual goodwIll now so happily Snbsisting between the two oountries, and to render these zentiments strong and enduring. With such sincere and heartfelt dispositons on both sides, should difficulties ever arise between the two Governments, these will be easily adjusted, in a spirit of mutual forbearance and concession. I return your Lordship my thanks for your kind expressions and wishes in referenoe to myself, and feel confident that in Our future intercourse we shall proceed harmoniously and satisfaotorily in discharging our respective duties."

The Colliery Explosion Near Barnsley.-
T1E COLLIEY EXPI,OSION NE BARNSLZY.- Operations havo at length commenced for emptying the colliery at LundhiUl of the water poured into it for the purpose of extinguishing the fire. From the information obtained from the men who explored the pit directly after the explo. sion as to the extent of the fire to the rise, and judging also from the tomporature of the water in the pit, the engineers who have the management came to the opinion a short time ago that if water were poured into the pit until it reached the height of 60 feet up the downcast shaft it would extinguish the fire. The water reached this height on Tuesday, and on the evening of that day operations were commenced for drawing it out by means of large iron buckets. After operations had fairly commenced it was found that the buckets discharged from 500 to 600 gaUons per minute. It is feared that several weeks mnst elapse before the pit can be emptied and any attempt made to recovor the bodies. Lime is mixed with the water drawn out of the pit as a disinfectant, to prevent any injurious consequences to the residents of the neighbourhood. Much anxiety stiU exists among the friends of the deceased as to the recovery of the bodies, and many assembled to witness the commencoment of operations for emptying the pit A waggon load of coffins sent from Barnsley to Lundhill a few davs ago, to be ready when the bodies shall be recovered, coreated a verv painful sensation in the intervening villages. The re-ventilation of the pit when empty will be promoted by two large fans which are being erected for the purpose, and it is understood that the bazardous task of exploration and recovering the bodies will be intrusted to a number of the most ,experienced miners who can be found in the district. The temjperature of the water in the pit not being yet quite nniform, it is said that some doubt still exists in well informed quarterS as to whether the fire is yet extinguished.

Disgraceful Riot at Kidderminster.
DI,SGRBAfEFUZ RIOT ad KIDDRBMINESTE&
(BY EL . AN-D INTEzNATIONAL T=LEGRArH.)
The contest in Kidderminater has been a severe one between the Right Hon. Robert Lowe, the late member, and the Conservative candidate, Mr. WiHiam Boycott, a local soicitor. On Saturday last-the polling-day-the electors were allowed to exercie their privilege in a comparatively quiet manner up to 2 o'clock in the afternoon, nothing beyond a little senseless groaning occurring st either of the polling booths. The various carpet mills closed on Saturday at 2 o'clock, and shortly after that hour the liberated workmen hastened towards the south polling booth, situated on Blakewaygreen, and by about 3 oclock there could not have been les than 5,000 or 6,000 men and women of the lower orders assembled upon this large open apae. This vast congregation of Boycott's supporters soon dispersed the respectable persons who had attended at the booth during the morning, and a scene ensued of the most abominable and barbarous character. Every one who was thought to be in favour of Mr. Lowe was hissed, groaned, and vilely treated. Forty special constables, and one ot two regular policemen, under the superintendence of the chief constable, Mr. Merrifield, contrived to preserve a space for voters to pass through the crowd to the booth, butwheuever an elector gave in his vote for r. Lowe the mob assailedhimwithgroans and execrations, spat upon him, kicked'and cuffed him, and subjected him to the most dastardly iUusage.
The canr in the service of the unpopular candidate were stoned and broken, but those of Mr. Boycott were allowed to pan along unharmed. Mr. Lowe remained in the south booth from 1 o'clock in the day until after the closing of the poll, and Mr. Boycott visited the plae occasionally, amid the uproarious cheers of his adniirers. Between 3 and 4 o'clock, when the mob ascertained that their man was likely to lose, stones were hurled into the booth at intervals. Mr. James Holmes, Mr. James Pardoe, and Mr. George Hooman, friends.of Mr. Lowe, were wounded by the missiles. On the close of the poll, at 4 o'clock, 3fr. Joseph Kiteley, the mayor, announced the numbers of votes recorded. This assurance of Mr. Boycotts defeat seemed greatly to exnsperate the mob, and several senseless and malicious individuals were observed inciting the people to attack the right hon. gentleman and his friends, who had triumphed. Stones were thrown into the booth. Loud imprecations were uttered gainst Mr. Lowe and Mr. James Pardoe, nud numerous Tory adherents prepared themselves with manifest premeditation to attack Mr. Lowe and his supporters. Loud calls were made for Mr. Boycott to " come out, and let us kill the -," and with a desire to queU the rising fury of the multitude Mr. Boycott and one of his friends, Mr. Best, mounted the hustings and requested the people quietly to disperse. The rafiians did not heed the advice given, and threw a volley of stones into the booth, injuring most of those inside it ; upon which Mr. Boycottand his friends retired sndproesedeA toiwards the town, the mob making Wyfor them and cheering them as they passed. Thefr-'dd ture was a signal to the cowards surrounding the booth, and instantly missiles of every description, stones, brickbats, palings, and even penny. pieces, were thrown at Mr. Lowe and his friends, accompanied. by oaths of the most feaxful character. Mr. Superintendent Merrifield, by the-direction of the Mayor, then prd d ito ls licesen and Mr. Loowe, wit1; Wr -.Jaames Pardoe and Mr. Holmes and others, walked up the lane, preserved here by the special constables. By this means the right hon. member got in front of the mob, although stoned all the way, and waited with the Mayor for a few moments while the constables formed themselves into an escort. Before, however, Mr. Merrifield's men could arrange themselves in order, showers of missiles literally rained upon Mr. Lowe, his supporters, and the officers. Mr. Lowe was bleeding copiously from a wound in the head, and nearly every person around him was cut on the face and head. Under these circumstances a retreat became necessary, and the right hon. member and his friends retired towards Mr. Shepherd's school, some 300 yards distant, hotly pusued by the infuriated mob, who stoned them with revolting brutality. Lucldly the pursued gentlemen gained refuge in Mr. Shepherd's house, which stands back from the road, and is protected by high iron gates and a seven-feet wall. The mob endeavoured to force an entrance into the place, and tried to wrench the locks off the gates; the attempts were unsuccessful, but they did considerable damage. Hundreds prowled about the spot for several hours, swearing that they would ki both Mr. Lowe and Mr. Pardoe, and it is pretty certain that they would have carried out their murderous intent had an opportunity offered, Mr. Lowe was so seriously injured and weakened from loss of blood that it waS found necessary to secure the services of Mr. Stretton, surgeon, forthwith. The mob allowed the medical man to pass through them into the house, and directed him toinform his patient that they were determined "to do for him" before he left Kidderminster. Mr. Stretton dis. covered that Mr. Lowe had sustained a fracture of the right parietal bone of the skull, in addition to a lacerated scalp wound and two severe contusions on the side of the head. Mr. Pardoe had suffered contusions on the head and body. Mr. Holmes received anincised wound on the scalp, from which blood flowed freely. Before the surgeon had attended to the gentlemen named Police-constable Jukes was carried into the house in a state of insensibility, covered with blood. The poor fellow had been struck nearly all over with istones. One missile had fractured two bones of his nose in a frightful manner, and another had caused a large lacerated wound of the skulU. It appears that part of the mob, on being foiled from further injuring their higher victims, commenced stoning, beating, and kicking the policemen.
they very soon scattered the specials, every one of whom exhibits marks of the fray, and it is almost miraculous that Mr. Merrifield and his nine regular officers (all there are in the town) escaped comparatively unhurt, notwithstanding that they were struck repeatedly on their heads and bodies with stones. Having lpelted the police as long as they pleased, and imagining that Mr. Lowe had escaped from 3fr. Shepherd's by the back way to the Albert Inn, in Bewdley-street, kept by Mr. Potter, the mob smashed every window in front of the building. Mr. Merrifield and what few of his men were not yet disabled made a bold stand against the crowd while they were committing this outrage, but of course seven or eight persons were powerless against hundreds. The crowd then defled into the town, amusing themselves by the way with occasionally smashing windovws, insulting every well-dressed person they met, and lustily yelling "Boycott for ever." For several hours hundreds of the populace paraded the thoroughfares, shouting and screaming. In order to vary the entertainment, the throng also engaged tlhemselves in puling down the shutters of establishments kept by unpopular persons, and in bonneting aU who dared to remonstrate with them. About 12 o'clock symptoms of a row were manifested by the mob colected in High-street, the preparatory tokens of hostilities being the breakage of windows in the Lion Hotel. At this juncture, however, the clatter of arms and horses' hoofs announced the arrival of a troop of 50 Hussars from Birmingham, which had been telegraphed for shortly after 4 o'clock, and the fear of cold steel had quickly a quieting effect upon the rioters.
The Mayor and magistracy, who had been sitting en perm4nence, made their appearance under the protection of the military, and his worship at once read the Riot Act, orders were given to clear the streets, and the soldiers and the police effected this operation in the course of two hours, The lussars remained on duty until 4 o'clock in the morning, and will stay in the town for one or two days, as it is feared another outbreak may occur on Monday. When our reporter left Kidderminster last evening the town was quiet and peaceable.
The police managed to apprehend four of the ruffians engaged in the riot, and wil summon before the magistrates a number of the local mobocracv who are known to have taken an active part in the md&ie.
Mr. Lowe was removed fromKidderminster betweenlOjad 11 o'clock at night. In addition to the gentlemen we have named Mr. Green, tax-collector, Dr. Ronald, and Mr.
Stockdale, of the Swan Inm, have been wounded. Hundreds of the people were cut and bruised about the head and face, for when the riot was at its height the mob attacked botl friend and foe.

The Bishopric Of Norwich.
I i TRE BISHOPRIC OP NORWICH.
The Bishop h&s issued thefollowingaddresa tothe clergy of the diocess of Norwich:-
"F'end, Brethren, and FellowMlfninkers,-Although it must be already known to meet of you that my connexion with you as your bishop is faxt drawing to a close, I cannot refrain from making the communlcaion to you myself, if only for tho purpose of bidding you a kindlyfareweU. I Ln the more anxious to do ao because my present position in respect to ou is somewhat different from that in which a parochiu psator usually finds himself when about to be rewoved from his flocl, or a chief pastor when quitting his diocees. In the latter eae, especially, the separation, whether caused by death or translation to another see, is more or less abrupt. To the last, or nearly so, he has been living among his clergy and as one of them. Confirmations, and all that portion of his workl rhich Is carried on out of his home and in public, have been keeping him in constant personal Intercourse with them, often in their several ocalities, and under circumstances that niake the relation in which they stand to one another a bond of intimate acquaintance and friendship. He has been, at one timne occupying their pulpits- at another, presiding over rmeetings which gather them about him, and associate them with him; he has been welooming them as his guests, or becoming their guest. When at length he is taken awa,y fram them, whether to another sphere of ervice or to his last dread amount, it is a severance of actual and close companionship, and he carries iLway with him sympathies and remembrances that need no refreshing. Such, unhappily, is not my oondition. Out of. the period during whichI have presided over the diocess of Norwich-a period of between seven and eight years-for the last three, and longer, the state of my health has prevented me from receiving you in my home, except on visits of business, and from undertaking that portion of my duty -to which I have been referring. Circumstanced as I have thus been, it is no slight consolation to me at this moment to know that none of this duty, comprehending all the episcopal ministrations for the diocess, has been neglected. Ordinations, indeed, I have still been able to take myself, except on two occasions, when I obtained the friendly assistance of brother bishops; while, through the like friendly assistance, the usual confirmations have been held, and all occasional services, such as the consecration of churches and bunalgrounds, duly performed. Still although all this portion of my duty has been done, and done as well and opportunely as if I had officiated myself, the result has been to estrange me, in a manner, from you and the diocew
and to make it appoar as though the tie that has connected us is not now to be broken, but has been long and gradually giving way. It is on this account that I am tho moro anxious at parting from you to assure you that I have not been the less alive to the sacred obligations imposed on me by that tie, nor le,s sedulously attentive to whatever his occurred affecting you, colectively and individually. Of this I may, I hope, have given some proof in the discharge of that other portion of my duty which I have continued to do myself-that, namely, which a bishop does in his home by means of correspondence and business interviews.
"It is in this department, as I need hardly remind you, that a bishop exercises what are most strictly the functions of episcopacy, embracing as it does a general superintendene of the affairs of his diocess ; and it is in this depart ment, I may add, that his work, although withdrawn from public observation, is most arduous and anxious It is in this that he has to deal with his diocess, and specially with his clergy, conformably to the expressive title that is conferred on him of 'Father' in the church, to use paternal authority and paternal kindness in counselling those who have reconrse to him for advice in their doubts and difficulties, adjudicating on complaints made to him, reconcieing differences, commending or reproving, encouraging or correcting, as need maybc, and assuming an aggregate of responsibility for all that is the ministerial duty of his clergy in their separate cures, to take oversight of that duty, and see that it is fuly and rightly performed. Who is sufficient for these things ? That I have been enabled, often under the trying pressure of bodily ailment, to apply myself unremittingly to this portion of my work is a mercy for which I cannot be too thankfaL That I have so used that mercy as to have done all herein wisely and weU I dare not affirm. If, at this crisis, I feel, as feel I must, that there has been much for which I have to ask a hInd construction from you, how much more must there be for which I have need to ask forgiveness of Him who seeg not as man sees, and judges not as man judge
"Better had it been for the diocese, and for yoU, I am painfully sensible of it, had the step which I am now taldng
en taken long ago; and this would have been the case had I acted in adherence to my own views and wishes. It is now three years since, despairing of ever being again stronenough for the requirements of a diocess such as this is. I contemplated resigning. Friends, however, with whom I took counsel, were more hopeful of my restoration to health and energy- and I permitted my own judgment to be overruled by tUeirs. At length, in June last, time having wrought no such change as had been anticipated, I determine to make no longer delay; and the then Bishops of London and Durham having applied for permission to resign, although under different circumstances from mine, I thought to have availed myself of the occasion and applied lkewis. For reasons into which I need not go the occasion was represented tome as inopportune; those reasons no longer applying, I renewed my request at a later period of the year, aund, the necessarystepshaving now beentakenfor enabling me to fulfil my purpose, I am preparing to make room for my successor at the end of the present month,
"God grant that he, whoever he maybe, may prove equal to the work tbat lies before him Such must, am sure, be your prayer as well as mine. That he will long continue to be so, unless he brings to it more than ordinary physical strength, my experience disnooes me to doubt. The work of this, and, I apprehend, of every diocess, is on the increase. It S a hoprf sign; it indicates an awakening vitaltyin
e ohurcn; but it caUs for some measure to enable the episcopate to koep pace in its exertions with the increasing demands on it. Whether the appropriate measure be the appointment of suffragan or coadjutor bishops, t which I, for one, see grave objections, or a division of, at all events, our larger diocesses, something must be done if the bishop is to be efficient for all the purposes of his office and position, not only in respect of the clergy, but of the laity, and especialy in the development of that principle now more and more claiming to be recognized, that laymen and clergymen must be fellow-workers in the church, if it is to accompliah all that is required of it at home and abroad.
" For whatever approach I may have made, in health or In sickness, towards fulfilling the demands on my office while I have been your bishop, I am in no smaU measure beholden, under Heaven, to you my friends and brother ministers. I cannot take my leave of you without gratefuUy acknowledging how little ot vexatious duty has been my portion, considering that this diocess compfises a far greater number of clergymen and cures of souls than anv other in England, and how much assistance and supportlI have received. To all I desire to dxprss my thanks; specially to those who, in their official connexion with me, have rendered services to me and to the diocess which I can never forget. The future bishop may and will, I trust, avail himself of that assistance for accomplishing more than I have accomplished, no future bishop wil value it more highly, or more gratefully remember it than I do.
" A few words more and I shall have unburdened my heart to you. The position which I have occupied among you has, as I have observed, made me responsible for the ministerial dxties of you all. That responsibilty wilU now pass fram me to another. But there are some concerning whom I have incurred a responsibility of which the resignation of my see cannot divest me. Of this number are thoeo on whom I have bestowed the preferment which, from time to time, has been at my disposaL Of all the duties of a bishop there is no one more calculated to fillhimwithfearandtremblingin the discharge of it than that of exercising his patronage; selecting those into whoso charge men's souls are to be consigned at his bidding. It is a privilege which some, who have it not, may unthinkingly covet, and which some, who have it, may think of as lawfuUy to be used in subserviency to their interests or their personal feelings; it may even, in the estimate of some, have only a marketable value: but to those who are once awakenedto a sense of all thatis impliecd in it it must ever be an awful privilege. If, in my use of it, I have in any instance failed to make the best provision which circumstances admitted for a vacant cure, I have in every instance honestly endeavoured to do so. To you whom I have selected I look to justify my conduct herein. Thus far, I may say, and I say it thankfully, I have never had reason to regret the appointments which I have made. I have good hope, therefore, that when Iam gone, and my acts, as bishop of this diocess, shall be canvassea anad judged, your ministry wil vindicate me from reproach in respect of the distribution of my patronage. If any of you desire to testify your sense of benefit derived from my selection of you, testify it by your minitry. If, recognizing the tie which has been thus formed between us, any of you ever wish to convey to
teo an acknowledgmeat of it, do it by your ministry. I ask of you no other remembrance of me, and my the Lord incline and enable you to fulfil this my heart's desire.
" Others there are, too, for whom I have made myself responsible, and mast stiU and for ever continue to be so. They are those who have received ordination from me; those whom, in the exercise of a momentous trust, I have acceuted, in the name of the lord, for his holiest service on eart , and invested with the church's authority for performing It. Of me it will be required if, through any negunqualifie d for mit. You, indeed,arenot the less accountable to your Lord and Mfaster in Hieaven for taking that of fice on you, end for your mauner ffliigi,bewcIa
oXAt A^_T_-ncoig_yo°u; hu,t neither shall I have the
lestoaser for becanie you aea com fvn own to render. Part from you I must not without reminding you of the relation in whicli we stand to one another, and asking from you some recognition of it; and this not for the gratification of personal feelings, but for edification. Something there is that you may do to this end; what I would suggest is, that you should set apart a day, or some portion of a day, and employ it in going over the ordination ervices, and impressing their import on you Call to mind the honr when you sought and received, throngh those services, your sacred ofrice; the workings of spirit which led you to seek it; the resoluxtions which you brought to it; and your subsequent course, its progress or its failures. Do this and then, at the Throne ot Grace, ask for grace to fulfi your ordination vows. Think not lightly of this suggestion. Besidesthe claim which I have to make it, on the ground of mine being the hands that were laid on you, I mnay prefer a claim also on the ground of much ministerial experience. It is now between 30 and 40 years, nearer the latter than the former, since I was what the youngest and last ordained among you now are. In that period many have been the vicissitudes of my lot, many and various the spheres of ministerial duty whicht I have occupied, in England, in Ireland, and in the colonies. Trust one who tells you, as the result of this experience, that it is good for all, and not the least for a minister of God, to have seasons pro. vided for him in the ordering of Providenco for sitting in solitude and communimg with God and his conscience. Neglect not this your present season,
"And if there be any of you-I do ant mean to imply imputation or snpicion agamst any; but if, as ma occur among large numbors, there be any of you who became Christ's ministers from unhallowed motives, or without due consideration, and if your calling has been to you since little more than one of tho world's callings, of you I mako

The Riots At Kidderminster.
THE RIOTS AT KIDDBRAfINSTlR.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES.
Sir,-Having returned from a business journey in time to record my vote in favour of Mr. Lowe, I entered the hustings at about half-past 2 this afternoon.
On my way from the station I overtook a number of illlooking men walking up to the hustings, 'with bludgeons in their hands, and large labels of " Boycott for ever" on their hats; but, as the elections in this town had of late years gone off peaceably, I had no suspicion at the time of the murderous assault so soon to be attempted, and which, as is since discovered, was already deliberately planned.
Both candidates w ere then absent from the hustings,4snd as the polling was well nigh exhausted there was little or nothing to excite the passions of the mob.
But the arrival of Mfr. Lowe about 3 o'clock was the first dgnal for an outbreak, and on his approach the windows of his carriage were struck by several stones and sticks.
Presently after Mr. Boycott arrived, v'hen his rafiins commenced pelting with rotten eggs, thrown from the crowd in front among the gentlemen on the hustings. The eggs, however, were closely foUowed by large showers of stones, which inflicted severe braises on those in tho front ranks. The stones were all a imed at Mr. Lowe's supporters, but one very severe blow in the face was received by a Mr. Green, assessor of taxes, and a very warm partisan of Mr. Boycott.
At this point one of Mr. Boycott's friends requested the crowd to stop, but those who were close to him considered his tone was ironical, and that he only wished them to go on; at least this was the way they understood him, and accordingly the showers became thicker and thicker.
About a quarter to 4 Mr. Boycott left the hustings, though requested to remain, as the mob was becoming every minate more furious, but he coolly said Mr. Lowe and his friends might take care of themselres, and one of his most prominent supporters added that " indeed he was not going to turn special constable."
After Mr. Boycott's departure the riot rapidly gained ground, insomuch that the mayor could not possibly declare theresuiltintheusual manner, but merely addressed the electors present on the hustings. It hadnowbecomeno secret that threats were rife among the crowd that if Mr. Lowe were elected he should not leave the hustings alive.
It became then a most serious question how Mr. Lowe and his friends were to escape from their dangerous position. The few police present were a mere nothing, anda band of special constables, though about 100 in number, behaved vith a disgraceful cowardice that showed their sympathies lay more with the mob than the canseofordertheywere sworn in to uphold. At length it was deterbpintid to brave the mob and to waik arm-in-arm from tlie -hsistings. The Mayor and fr. W. B. Best, a justice of thbjpeace, and father of Mr. Lowe's late opponent, walked first, followed close behind by Mr. Lowe and his principal supporters. Their presence, however, was no protection, for now the facts proved how deeply the plan to murder M1r. Lowe had been Jaid.
Immediately on their descent 'from the h^ustingsthick volleys of stones and brickbats flew from both aidres of the rosd, every minute seeming to -make the assailants more numerous and more violent. I
In about 100 yards we came under a bank 8 or 1O feet high, lined with the mob, evidently planted there by a akilful marshal and acting under orders, who rained down a perfect storm of bricken ds and large stones, which they had collected from the adjoining field. Mr. Lowe wag, of course, the principal-mark, and, next to him, Mr. James Pardoe. They both received an immense number of bruises, and Mr. Lowe had his skull fractured, though it is hoped not dangerously.
- Many gentlemen were streaming with blood from gashes ontheir heads, necks, or faces. Several were knocked down and nearly trampled on while stunned by the blows they received; two lost their hats. I myself, with some others, was lsaved by my hat from having my skaull fractured. Others again were fearfully bruised in the less exposed parts of the body, and without doubt a large number of lives must have been sacrificed but for the providontial refuge afforded by Woodfield-house, the residence of the Rev. J. G. Sheppard, who had heard the threats of murder |made an hour or two before, and with great wisdom had locked bis front gate andastood by it, calling to the victirms of the mob to hurry to the side gate, which admitted of a Eafer entrance.
Mr. Sheppard, with two friends, stoutly resisted the entrance of the mob, who pressetl savagely on the heels of the persecuted refugees, aad as this mode of escape had fortu. nately been overlookeda y' the concoctors of the riot the mob were thrown aback adid abstained from further violence.
Too much praise cannot be given to Mr. and Mrs. Shep. pard for the prompt and thoughtful kindness with which they at once set themselves to remedy as far as possible the injuries irflicted by the mob.
I have known Kidderminster above 30 years, but never was there such a malignant spirit displayed as to-day. It was fiercer than the fiercest violence of the old disnutaq

Vandalism In The Temple.
V4NDAISA IN TEE TBMPLB.
TO THE EDITOBP OF TEB TIMES.
Sir,-The spirit of destructiveness is not less active and daring in London than at Dover, and the offenoe against good taste and good feeling wi here also be perpetrated by a corporation which, like the Government, has neither a body to be kicked nor a soul to be damned.
Most of your London readers have no doubt soon EAson. court and the garden with the fountain in the Middle Temple-one of the quaintest and moast channing relics of old London-and will surely be horrified to hear that the benchers of the Middle Te-nple have determined to destroy the old garden and build upon the gite.
The design ws kept quiet till very lately, but as soon as it became known a petition was prepared in haste, and has been igned of course by nearly every Templar now in town, imploring the benchers not to perptrate a earrism which is against the feeling of every one who has no direct nterest in the new building.
_ : . Isam. sir.
