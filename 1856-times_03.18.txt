FOROGR INWTMLlGECE. I * . .~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ACCOUCHIJEMENT= - . OF TIE EMPRESS OF THE FRENCH. (IROM oUR oWN COR=PUNDENT.) I poAIVO- of, the: following appeared inL our smoad etion of ysteraiy:-] - PARIS, SATUPtDAY, HAxCE 15, 6 P. The Emprmss was taken with the pains of childbirthat about 5 o'clock this morning. As soon as it became known that the accouchement was at hand due notice was sent round to the Princes of the Imperial Family by the Princess of FEsing, Grand Ms of the Empress Household. The attendance was prompt. Among ttose of the family who were summaoned to the Tuilerie. was Prince Lucien Louis Bonaparte, who only arived from London on Tueaday evening last. His Highness had met with a severe accident in his own house before leaving; a piece of marble fell where he happened to be standing, and broke the great toe of his left foot. Aware of the approaching accouchement of the Empress the Prince was anxious to come to Panis at all risks, but the pain lie has suffered since the journey is intense. When he received notice this morning from the Palace he exprebsed his desire to be present, but the pain and inflammation in the foot were such that the Emperor desired he should remain quiet, and that he should be represented on the qccasion by another Prince of the family, the son of Prince Charles of Canino. The summons was sent of State, and the high functionaries of the Government. The Senate soon after assembled at the Luxembourg and the Deputies in their Chamber. The Presidents of those bodies and the high functionaries of State proceeded to the Palace of the Taileries, to be in attendance. TheEmperor, the Princess of Essling, and Madame Montijo, the Empress's mother, have remained the whole of the day in the Empress's apartment. The dignitaries of the empire are assombled in the green drawing-room, close to the Empress's chamber. Iu the apartments further off are the Emperor's aideTsde-camp and the offlicers of the household. The first pains, it is said, were severe, but were less so some hours after, and, so far as couladbe known up to 4 o'clock, the Empress was going on as wellas could be expected. Thefollowingis the official notice posted up at the Bourse at a quarter-past 2 o'clock p.m. - " Her Majesty the Empress felt the first pains of labour about 5 o'clock this morning. You shallbe inforued immen diately of the birth of the Imperial infant." The Municipal Council of Paris is assembled en permanenwe at the Hotel de Ville. Numerous groups were stationed from an early hourinthePlacadu Carrousel, and in the gardens and ,erracesof theTuileries. Preparations aremade at all 'the public buildings for illuminations, the first sound of the cannon of the Invalides is awaited -with anxiety, and the artillerymen have been standing at their guns with matches lighted the whole of the d3y, e expecting every moment the signal from the Tuileries. It was reported this morning that at 2 'cloc0k the. delivery might be expected, and again at 4; but no signal has up to the moment I write announced the event, and no fresh despatch haa been published. Independently of the political importance attached to an event which makes people forget for the moment even the conferences, it cannot be denied that great interest is very generally felt and good wishes breathed for the safe delivery of the Empress.

SUuDAY, wIfAU 16, 6 m You will have received, I trust, long, before the hour I am now writing, the despatch which announoes the event so important to the Bonaparte dynawty-the safe delivery of the Empress and the birth of a Prince. I informed you in my letter of yesterday that Her Majesty began seriously to feel -the pains of childbirth about 5 o'clock yesterday morning, when notice,was sent round to the Ministers and great functionaries of State to be in attendance. She felt indisposed as early as 1 o'clock. Her labour, which, in the beginning, and at subsequent intervals, was very severe-so much so, I am assured, as to have required the appliances of artcontinued with some periods of tranquillity for 22 hours and at a quarter past 3 this morning al anxiety and danger were over, and the Empress gave birth to a male child. The infant is described as robust, and with every appearance of health; and the mother, though necessarily weak, is, to use the formula on such occasions, ias well as can be expected under the circumstances." -At 6 o'clock the cannon of the InvaZides announced tothe city, which wasbuthalf awakened, the tidings that the Imperial Throne had an heir, but the fact was not generally known till about 8 o'clock. In an hour or two after the birth telegraphic despatches were sent from the Foreign-office to the various diplomatic agents of France on the continent; and the one transmitted to Dresden was received and an answer returned, withthe usual congratulations, in about an hour and a-half. Notice was, of course, at once sent to the representatives of foroign Powers in Paris, who, in the course of the morning, proceeded to the Tuileries and left their names. Inquiries were made as to the propriety of the plenipotentiaries presenting in form their respects to-day at the palace, but it *ai intimated that it wouldbe better to do so to-miorrow at the _aame time-as the members of the resident diplomatic corps. Preparations were already made at all the public eatablishments for illuminations and the display of drApery. Many of the houses on the Boulevards are decorated with streamers. The theastres are profusely hung with them, and the flags of .England, France, Turkey, and Sardinia float united at this moment of rejoicing, as they did in the long and dreary hours of suffering and danger. The various embassies have stands before them ready for -lamps; and, not last or least among them, is the well known 33, Faubourg St. Honord, so long! vacant, but which, Ipresume, will soon be no longer so; it is occupied by Count Orloffuntil Me Kiseleff, or xome other representative of the Czar, returns to his quarters. Satisfaction is generally expressd, and I believe it is sincore-exp9s exdcpiendia-at the Empress's delivery; and this satisfaction is in nowise diminished by the improvement in the health . of the Emperor's uncle, Prince Jerome, wiro, it was feared, wias about to quit the world at the moment, his little nephe' was entering it. 5he interest Inoticed yesterday, when it was known that the Empras' labour had commenced, increaed as the day wore away, and as night came on, while no sound was heara from the Invalides, numerous groups of people thronged the approaches to the Palace and the public thoroughfares, partcularly the Boulevards, and when 10 o'clock came and still the guns were silent, and no supplement to the Monitcur apweared, people began to feel real anxety as to the result. The official announcement of the conclusion of peace is now only wanting to complete the public satisfaction. We read in the Pahrie:- - "At 1 o'clock on Saturday morning the Empress felt the first pains, and from that moment until the hour of her delivery, on Sunday, at a-quarter past 3, Her Majesty expe. rienceod at intervias acute sufferings, interrupted bymomentY relief During the whole of Saturday and the folowing night tho physicians in attendance, seeing Her Majesty a prey to such sufferings, believed that her delivery wr-'at hand, when a mitigation of her pains intervened and retaided the event so impatiently dem;red. The Empress then either enjoyed a little xepose or walked in her room, looldng with delight at the multitude assembled in the garden in front of her windows. The Emperor encouraged and consoled her by the most tender and affectionate expressions. He told her that all the churches were crowded with the faithful praying the Almighty forher delivery, and that allU aris vas offering to Heaven the most ardent wishes in her behalf. 'The Empress then felt her courage redouble at the Idea that she was the object of such universal sympathy. Finally, this morning, a fewr minutes before 3 o'clock, the suffering6 of Her Majesty assumed so decided a character that it va& deemed advisable to call in the princes and granI digpitaries of the empire to witness the birth of the T-- infant. It appears that the sight_ -, produced an effectw' ,.-N So ini persons -~.wraEmnress. ewbic -a teauspFbilsended for a ------_ Hhaturi. Her )Xgesty then experienoed the most excruciating agony, -which the sidii Qf the physicean succeeded at last in allaying; and at a quarter past 3 o'clock the Imperial infant came into the 'world. The young Prince is of so robust a constitution that he is nearly asbigas the child of his nurse, who is two months old. The infant remained in' tle apartment of his mother until the hour of mass, and after being baptized CondoyO) was removed to his own apartmient. Palms were distributea to all the persons present at the Tuileries." Tne ceremony of the o2tdoime2t was performed with much pomp in the chapel of the Tuileries. Near the altar, on the Gospel side, stood Cardinals Dupont, Gousset, Donnet, and Marlot, and M. Legrand, curm of St. Germain rAunerrois, the Impe-' rial parish. Opposite, on the Epistle side, were the Bishop of Nancy, first chaplain of the Emperor, and his clergy. In the centre of the Sanctuary, in front of the Emperor's armchair, was a table, covered with white drapery, bearing a splendid silver-gilt baptistery. Next to it were the Admirals and Marshals of France and otherhigh dignitaries, the GrandMasters of theImperialHouse. hold, andthe MIasters of theCeremonies; the Princess Mathilde and the ladies of Honour of the Empres5. At half-past 12 o'clock the Emperor entered the chapel, accompanied bythe members of the Imperial I family, the Ministers, the Presidents of the Senate and Legislative body, and the Grand Master of the Ceremonies. The Bizhop of Adras havig celebrated ! mass, the Abb6 Deplace rose, and, taldng for his text those words of the Gospel, IIBenedictus qui jtenit in nomnile Domini," called down the blessings of the Almighty on the newborn Prince, and thus concluded his invocation.- "Bestow on him ihe genius and magnanimity of his father, the Idndness and inexhaustible charity of his mother, the sincere fith and devotion of both; and, to sum upthose wishes in one word, bestow on him aheart worthy of his destiny and of his name." After mass the Imperial infant 'was brought in by his governesses, when the Bishop of Nancy, assisted by the parish priest of St. Germain rAuxerrois, proceeded to christen him. A Te Detum was afterwards chanted, and the baptistery having been removed, the parish priest placed on the table the two registriesinwhichthebaptisnmal act of Napoeleon Eug ne Louis .Jean Josepl, -Sjs de France, -waa inscribed. The Emperor signed iton both registers, after which the same formality was gone through by P?rince Murat, the Duke of Albm, Marshal Vailiant, Minister of WYar; M. Troplong, President of the -+a-umand, Count de. Morny, President of the Legislative body. TleDttne - quently chanted, and, the bishop having bestowed ihis benediction on all present, H Mlajesty left the chapel, and was condueted backl to his apartments by the same personages who attended him on his arrivaL The Senate and the Legislative body met this morning at 8 o'clock, and receiveed a message from the Minister of State, announcing to them the birth of the Imperil Prince. M. de MIorny communi-1 cated the event in the following terms to the Legis. lative body: - " Gentlemen,-last night, at 4 o'clock, the Emperor sent one of his aides-de-camp to apprise the legislative body of the safe delivery of the Empress. Her M1ajesty gave birth at a-quarter past 3 o'clock thls morning to an Imperial Prince." (M. de Morny was here interrupted by cries of " Vive L'Empereur I") "I perceive, gentlemen," continued the President, "that you share the joy of all France." (Unanimous acolamations.) "7iViveZnpereu-! Vi.se Urnyeratrice! Vive le Prince IrpriaiP' These cries were enthusiastically repeated by the Assembly, and when silence was restored the President informed the deputies thar they would be received on Mfonday (to-morrow), at the Tuileries, by the Emperor. The Chamber then adjourned. The birth of a son-the heir to his name, and the inheritor of his crown-seems to complete the measure of the marvellous prosperity which has lately marked the eventful life of the Emperor. It wants but four days to the anniver. sary of another birth that was encircled with a yet more briliant halo of glory. Onthe 20th of arch, 1811, 45 years ago, the guns of the Invalides proclaimed to this same city'of Paris that the first Imperial Throne had an heir. We are told by eye-witnesses not much advanced in years of the joy displayed on that occasion; how the irst discharge on the, morning of the 20th roued, as if with an electric shock, the population of the capital; how each sounding report was counted with breathless anxiety ti the twenty-first peal was heard; how, when 21 guns had been fired, which were to indicate the birth of a Princess, the anxiety of all grow to an intolerable pitch; how, when the gunners paused some minutes before the next piece was fired, hundreds of thouands held their breath; and how, when the 22d, 23d, and 24th-for then there could be no misreckoning-pealed, double charged, the people sprang up and gave vent to their joy in. shouts of enthusiasm! It would, perhaps, be too much to report such an outburst of exultation now. People have become so blase in TevoIntion, so accustomed to-overthrowr of dynasties and to changes of' government, that ;whatever fuiicdof enthusiam they might have once possessed has been pretty well exhausted. They feel, it is true, they are governed by a firm hand, and that, so long as life and energy are spared to the present occupant of the throne, if there is not much hope of the liberty which has been so much and so often misused, there iill less chance of anarchy. .The birth of the heir to the second empire, it will be admitted, occurs under circumstances not less favourable than the. first. It is true that the first Napoleon was then in the zenith of his power-from the 20th of March, 18 , to the fist dissterswhich awaitedhimbeyond the Niemen. The empire, with the States poasep-ed by the Imperial family, then counted not les than 57,000,000 souls. But it is no less true that the moment was fast approaching when his power, unexampled in modern times, began to deline, until it fell to ruin. The clouds were already beginning to darken the horizon. -The seeds of the conflict with Russia, whiceh -was 'to end in the stupendous catastrophe of MoBscow,I had already been sown. The father of the p*ieent ralerof Fance, wearied with the exigencies o, hi imperious brother, had abdicated in despar, the throne of Rojand, which he could -noc loige hope to fill as an independent Sovereign. rTh, incorporation with the French empir3' of thet Valois, the annexation of the Hai*e 'Towns Iand the Grand Duchy of Oldtenbuig, the ruler of which was the brother-in-law of Alexander, ancl ,,which brought the French empire toLtbelk, within eight of the Rusian frontier, awakened t4ejealousy of Rnus-ia, and justified the pciontat the restoration of Polandwas at :h TIie refusal of Napoleon to ratify the Conveation of Ch3pny, the uke of the Czar relaxing his decrees against English commerea, the resumption of the kingdom of H3:anover from Jerome,were among the precuors of the storm that -wa to follow. Yet all these symptoms oI approaching decline were, in the mind of Napoleonx, rmore than compensated by the birth of the King of Rome on the 20th of March, 181:1. The state of Europe at this moment is so famiiar to all that it is hardly neoe!sar _f-iudeHto e%e difference of cireuanrceiis under which the event annouuc-this morning talkes place.

A private letter from Mldrid of the 10th mentions that the publc and the press (which, whatever be its faults otherwie, ig in commercial matters _Ihbersl} were exceedingly surprised by tne appearance in the official organ of the, - Government of & long decree, promulgating a new tarif; which not only does not realize the- general expectation, .bat whiclh is, in pDit of fact, as restrictive as it well can be. It is essentially retrograde as compared with the work of Senor Bruil, which, in fact, it undoes; which was based on a5und principles, and did much, if it did not do all it might and ought; while the present one especially touches those parts in which English commerce is concerned. This new tarif; wrhich Senor Santa Cuxu no doubt regards as a masterpiece, is said to have been planned in silenca and in solitude. It is evident, too, that it must have been put together -with an industry and haste by no means characteristic of the labours of Spanish Ministers in general, -as the gentlema who now fills the post of Finance Minister has been in office hardly a fortnight. - The sudden production of a tariff, so rapidly concocted, can be attributed to nothing else than a desire to take people mnawares and to prevent any serous opposition, or even discussion, on its articles. Indeed, it appears every one at Lfiadrid wvas taken by surprise; and the delicate plant, the early productof the financial hothouse, wil be attempted to be forced through the Cortesunder the protecting influence of the Duke de la Victoria, who, so far as can be judged, is determined to support Senor Banta Qruz. Senor Bruil's tariff was a deliberate work, openly constructed by a commission of the Cortes; while the hasty fabric of his successor is the result of a decree, and is put together in weakness and ignorance. Hoslity to foreign countries is evident throughout, and by competentjudgesit has beenpronounced as, to all intents and purposes, a commercial retrograde Coup cdgtat. The more enlightened among Spanisi statesmen cannot but regret this return to the past. Certainly more was expected from the men who now govern Spain. They cannot be na,cquainted with the condition of the country, nor. with the remedies which it requires; and the heitation to adopt them, if not evidence of hostility to the liberal commercial system which elsewhere has been followed by such good results, evinces degree of weakness incompatible with a popular Administration. The excuse probably is the old apprehension of exciting discontent in Catalonia, and the fear that, if a movement in favour, of an odioui monopoly broke out there, the niational guards of Barcelona and of other manufacturing'towns would rather side with insurgents in such a cause than -wit the G*overnment. A private letter, from that troublesome city says that there are many more republicans in the north than is generally suppoed, and that French emigrants of .that party: take a legd among them. If, - however, such. am. excse be alleged as justifying the perpetuation of a system which oppresses the finances of the couni[t and causes immense. moral injury-if all Spain is still to be sacrificed to class interest-thenx there is little hope for the future. In other times it was easy to getup an insurrection in Catalonia, because it found sympathy and support- among foreign agents. That danger, however, is diminishsed, and a movement on such grouds against. the Government would now have lest chance of success. T.he .Catalan manufacturers will never relinquish their monopoly voluntarily, and if they can -thus menace the central Governmentwhenever a.measurefraught with benefit to the public at large .is- brought.forward the Government that yields to the threat haa hardly a right to call itself strong or popular..

At an extraordinary meeting of the Australian iflinmg Company held to-day, MIr. R. F. Davis in the c1air, the report, after a leng-thened discussion, was received. It was at the &ame time stipulated that 'the directors shall restrict the current expen-diture to the amount of the last call, ancd that they -are not to incur any additional liabilities without -consulting the shareholders as to the desirableness of continuing operations. The directors appear xicus to test the capabilities of the Carlton Mline, resp:cting which favourable accounts have been re.ceived, and, under these circumstances, it was uagree1 that the experiment should be carried out. The following is an e:tract from the report, together with a stvatement of liabilities and assets to the 8th -inst. :- c; 'When the present board came into office in 1851, they found the financial position of the companyat its lowest ebb. The then ascertained debts were above 20,0001., and the bankers declined to mia-e further advances or to cash the bills of the company's agents in the colony; and hence, for all transactions of this nature since 1851, the directors .have been obliged to render themselves personaUy liable. It w-as onlyby a large issue-of loan notes, joined to great exerLions cn the part of the board, that the affairs of tEe cornpany were kept in order. The amount of loan-notes was . rdu3ly reduced till, in July, i854, it steoid at only 3,9201. '¶Lie amount now due on loan notes is 1,1107. The caUof11.- per slhare made by the old board in 1851 discharged a portion of ther liabilities; the remainder of their liabilities wasliquidated by a call of 17. made in August, 1853; and.thetwo las,t calls, each of 10s., have been appropriated to,payi -off the balance of loan-notes and carrying on the resle workligs at Tungkillo. The purchase of the Carlton mineJ: and the provision of a sufcient sun to test it, has also been obtained from the same source. The shareholders must li&aware that, however economical maybe the intentions of the Iboard and the course pursued by their agents, it is impossible to commence and continue operations upon anZ property without a supply of the sinews of war. The board trust, that if the last call be fully and promptly paid up, there-sil be in hand an ade9uate supply of funds to test the value of the Carlton Mine; .and the board adhere to their oft expressed determination to enter upon no further i=atttr without consulting the shareholders.

Gordon and Gregory, civil engineers, and Lieutenant Aitcheson, R.N., all of which are in your possession. i" In these exmeriments this-patent fuel was composed of the Trinidad pit-ch and ligneous fibre, in the proportion of 7A per cent. of the latter, thoroughly incorporated in a melted state, and moulded into blocks, being then consumed in ordmnary furnaces with 50 per cent. of Mferthyr coaL " The small proportion of ligneous fibre which has thus been proved tolbe sufficient for the purpose is due to the perfect amalgamation of the constituents, obviating at once the expense and inconvenience of using that large proportion of wood which the writer refers to. "Theuse of the raw material with coal will be found practically useless, as in most cases the bitumen, in melting, runs through the bars or extinguishes the fires by choking the furnace. " I would also remark, that this patent fuel may be, and has been, repeatedly burnt er se, when it could be supplied with a sufficient quantity o air, as was amplyverified during the course of the experiments made under my superin tendence, though not with equal efficiency, or so great an economy as with coal.

RXNTox, Civil Engineer, " 3, Hanover-chambers, Buckingham-street, Adelphi, Marchl4"' "To T=E DIREcTois OF THE TBrIDAD BITUOUS FUEL COMPAN.R "Gentlemen.-A letter in the money article of lTue Timet of yesterday, signed 'An Ex-Planter,' has mentioned my name in conjunction with your enterprise in amanner calcu. lated to throw doubt upon the advantages of my new system. { of manufacturing fuel from the pitch of the great lake of Trinidad.- i "It has therefore become incumbent on me to addrbss you on the subject. Leaving aside 'Em-Planter's' regret to see money invested in a patent plan which is already iu common use, and which has not sufficient merit to induce planters to use it without paying any Royalty or other charge, his object is to show that, because bitumen has been used in small quantities in river steamers, and by persons in the immediate vicinity of the lake, and required ive times the weight. of the bitumen in wood to burn it, or 50 per cent. of coal, therefore my method, by wrhich not merely the planters in the vicinity of the lake may be enabled to consume the bitumen, but those of the adjacent islands as well as ocean steamers, cannot. be adopted with advantage. "WVith reference to the statement that the bitumen carL be burnt vwith 50 per cent. of coal, I furnish you with the report of a series of exceriments made in the West Indies.in 1849, at which his Excellency the Governor of Trinidad and several gentlemen of the colony were oiresent; every 'method was adopted that could be devised to insure a desirable result, and some further experiments in England were made, but without any success. Certainly, ocean steamers could not carry five times the weight of woodto pitch, and I think any one will do the owners of ocean steamers the justice to suppose them possessed of common sense enough to burn a fuel composed of 50 per cent. of coal and 50 per cent. of pitch, the first being aout 3. or 40s. per ton, the second Ss. or 4s. per ton, were it practicable to do sot; the best answer to this is, that it has never been done. Now, with reference as to whether I have succeeded in making a fuel which, being about the same bulk, possesses certainly equal neat-giving properties as coal, . refer you to the numerous trials on the fuel when burnt with coal and made in the presence of. an engineer fromn Woolwich dockyard, who vwas-by the Lords of the Admiralty obligingly ordered to - attend on board of the steamer Lady of- the Lake. Mr. Renton, civil engineer, also verified the trials, and the official report exactly -coinbided lwith his tabulated statement which you have published. Other scientific gentlemen subsequently made experiments, of whose very favourable reports you ire in possession. I wiUl not trouble you with any further remarks, save to say that my grant for manufacturing fuel will not interfere with the utilzation of the crude material by those who are fortunate enough to do so with those happy advantages that the " Ex-Planter' enumerates, 'that there is no dAemand for the pitch as fuel, it being found that coals alone are both cheaper and more convenient than the pitch burnt as before described.' " In corroboration of the novelty and advantages of my invention, I annex the opinion of the press of the island. at the time of my application for the ordinance.

The -principal of these annuitants are, at present, the Duke of Cambridge, who holds 1 share; the, Duke of Devonshire, I; Sir John Angemteimn, JL L ]Ady Ileanchmp, 1; Sir George Caroll, 3; the T ofDanouth ; Sir.John Dodson, 3; Captsin Forbes3,, ; Lady Hinricl, 4- Mr. Loftus Lowndes, 2; Mr. MIorgan, 2'; Sir Join Btuszove, 1; executors of the Duchess of ft.

BdirBjd 1; Mr. Hird, 3; Mr. HAwkins, l 3. &c. - The proprietors were re,presented by .r. Surman, Cti Willett, and Captain Forbea, jun. Dr. Smethurst was requested to occupy the chair. Mr. SurxAs, solicitor, of Lincoln's-inn-fields, inaddres. ing the meeting, said,-I attend on the part vf the pro. prietors of the late Covent-garden Thestre, to give you a short statement of the position of that theatre, in order that, by. a knowledge of its position, you may hava some gudanceforyourfature conduct. The theatre w;as held upon sx leases from the Duke of Bedfr.L Mhere were 38 years unexpired of the tenn, and the rent payable to the' duke was 2,051. perannum. Intheyearl803 the theatre was burnt doWn3, and was rebuilt in 1809. Upon that occasion 150 shares of 500!. each were issued, which realized a sus fo 75,0D00. Of these.150 aresof 5001- the-gentlemen-who now attend represent the original holders, who were entitled to an annuity of 251. on ach share for the whole termn of the lease, which had 38 years to run and also a free trans. ferrable admission. In the year 1832 the theatre was in. difficulties. The sareholders had received no annuityfor the last seven years, aud the proprietors had incurred a losao of from 70,0001L to 80,0001.; therentvasin arrear, executions. were in the house, and the property appeared tDbe ruined, Various meetings took place in that year, especiAlly aMong the shareholders, who hadsolarge aninterest iri the property. U,timately, in the month of '3Mrch, 1832, the shareholdeis: came to a resolution to give up entirely the arrears of the annuity for the last three years, and to acoept1Os. in the pound for the four years prior to these; and they also agreed that, instead of havmgg25L. a-yea;r, ins,. f*ethr1iJay would takehaif that sum, or 12Z. lOs., until the theatre, was free from debt. That arrangement had been carried. outsuocessfully froml132 to-thepreserqtj,ime. I believec tbkre has only been one year in which gertlemnen have not; r `,4,their annuity with almost as great rngularity a.; cleare odI' er-In that 'year-though I aw. not quite, A Shareholder.-It was fbe-.. a r43 Mr. SURZ,IA2.-For 22 ouat of the Z paid with extreme regulrity. I believe, too, tbab . thu arrers which were due in 183Z upon which lOs. in the, pound were payable, have been paid ofME At the time wher the haxreholdors agreed tD assist tho proprietors by thu reduction of their annutiee, a saving was effected of 1,875!.' The total amount of the fall anumity of 25!. upon 15ci shares was equal to 3.7501. and the half of that, or.1 0.. in-the pound, was 1,8775! That chage o f 1,8705!. forreed s second charge upon the property, the first charg beinP thc, Duke of Bedford's rent, amounting to 2,085. The De d' Bedford, in 1832, with equal liberality, consented to'rsduco his rent by 50W1. &-year. By that means the rent becamn reducedtol,5K4 There is also let with he theatre th Piazza Coffee-houise, which produces a ntal of 315L, anda i sniali house in Princes-lace, which ikliat at 40. If, there.. fore, from the 1585! of rent we deuct'th eums of 3151 and 40M.; derived from the other propery, it'wilI leave the total rent chargeable upon the theatre 1,230o In addition to this, in all our dealingswith the property, we-have found it necessary to pay the rates and tAxes ourselves, ind to let the theatre for an annual sum, we paying these rates and. taxes. Last year these items of expense amounted to 1,020!.; it has been as xuch as 1,200!., and as low as 8D. These constitute a third charge onthe property. Tho neri items of expense are salaries. We have been bound to pay the four firemen, whom we have kept upon the property, a the theatre was not insured - in fact, the premuins of insurance amount to a sum which it worald be impossible to pay.' The salaries of the firemen were 3751L The salary of r. lRobertson Was 250g. a-year. There are further items of expense. We are bound by our covenants'to Jee.p the-outer walls in repair, and to paint it outside. There as a charge for stationery, and for insurances of the Piazza Coffee-house, and the small house in Princes-place. These, Which may be classed under the head "mi'scellaneous,comprise altogetherabout2501. a-year. Thesesaresixitems of the charg upon the property, and, if added to-ether, they wil be found to amount to a total of about 5,0001. a-year. For three yers we were unable to get any tenant at all except theAnti-Corn-lavw Lue, but stll rwe managed to pay our debts. Thenwe got hL Persiani as a tenant, nho cornverted the theatre into an oper--house. Ouragree_ sient with him was at a reat of 6,0001. per annum. Afer him we made an arr=gement with Mr. Gye for a term of 10 years, the rent for the first three yers to be 6,500!, and, for the remainder of the term, 7,O00. a-year. Assuming these figures of liabilities to bo correctly stated at 5,000C. a-year, there wouid he an aunnalprofit of 1,000!. a-year 6-the rental of 6,WO0;:anad of 1,5001o on that. of 6(,500 But ifr we take the working of the theatre from the years 3.S9oio s^ ieee, *.r oO p,.jflrlug th, whole or that term would not be more than 600. a-year, and this upon a property which, I am told, in 1809 cost 300,CO0lD. Wvithx respect to the property, it is held in twelfth shales, and they are dliviaed ni the following manner --The executors of thee late Charles Kemble hold two-twelfths. - At the death of Charles Kemble those ahares were left tohischildrentwo daughters and a son-and 'at the_ present time all his affairs are in the Court of' Chc:ucery. The r maining seven-twelfths of the 'property belong to the 'Harris family, and that is representad by myself * the executor and trustee of the family. My- friencfd'r. Harri died in l839, and Iam sorry to say that he owed at that time 50,0001. of private debts, wrhich were secured by mortgages on his shares inthis theatre, not one shiling of which. hasyet been paid, or is kely' ever to be paid. You see, therefore, theposition in wbich the proprietors are placedthe representatives of the largest one of them owing debt to the amo-ut of 50,000!., and the two shares of Charles Xemble in Chanoery, and valued at 5001. But, looldng to the worling of the theatre since 1S32. At that periodithere was a general debt on the property of 70,O00., besides the arrears of the annuities, for which 1Os. in the pounnd were agreed to be taken, which came to somethilg like 4,0D0. ; money was borrowed, the creditors behaved with extrenme liberality, and eventually the whole debt, by tie exercions of lfr. Moore and Captain Eorbes, was reduced to about 24,0D00. Vhat vwe have been worheag for ever since 1832 has been this average profit of G00I. a-yes which has-gone to liquidate the general debt of 24,000. which now stands at about 9,O000. Were the theatre standig at this moment, it would be encumbered with 5,000. a- year, and were you to build it tomorrovw you would put another 5,000! a-year. upon it, and the propertt is not worth 10,000!., nor 8,000!., nor even 7,000. -ayear. The Duke of Bedford's allowance of 500!. a-year is not likely to be deviated from, and the renters' deduction of 1,75,'. is also, perhaps, notlikely to be departed from. But assoon as we have paid off the remainder of the debt of 24,000!., now amounnting to 9,000!., the renters will be entitled to. their full annuity, and when that takes place the theatre will be unproductive for any purposes at alL I may sta,te to you, for parties representing a sum of 75,000!. charged upon this property, that if you. can in any way convince yourselves of the -advantages of dealing with the Duke of Bedfordfor v renewal of the lease-for -with the present 'ulexpired term. of the lease you could do nothing-and can see your way to raising 70,00SL or 100,0001. for the rebuilding of the theatre, the proprietors will be happyto renderyouany assistance in their power. I may also add, that incur agreerment with Persiani we had to allow 1,000!. one year for repairs, 2,0001. in another, and 1,000!. in a third year. This will tend to explain why the annual profit has not been so large as it would otherwise appear. In the year 1855 our profit was 1,5001., but mri: Gye is in our debt 1,700!., which is2001. more than ourprofit for that year- I A Shareholder.-I cannot see how it is that Mr. Gya should be in debt; he-received 4,0001. for JWullien's concert,s, and 2,000!. from Mr. Anderson. Mr. Suna z.-Mr. Gye promised that he wvould sendine 800I. before the house,was burned down.. The arrears of Mfr. Gye have extended over everal years. '-We did rot, like to press a good tenant such as Ir. Gye was llr. SarFx.-ltbin the parties who let the theatrohavg been very remiss in their duties. We ought to have been called togother before the bluing of the bouse, a'u&not aft;r the event. If we hadthen been toldthat itwas propod1dto let the theatre to Mr. Anderson, knowing that two theat'e- in the occupation of that gentleman had previonsly been burnt to the ground, we should certainly have ob3ected to lethnm'occupy the building. IthMink the best courtse we can adopt as to' appoint 'a' comnmittee ~to wxatdh over 1he interests of the renters, and to' investigate in a seahing manner into the origin-of the zire. The CsLaInM~.-I 'think the site of the theatre' may be used for the enlargement of Covent-garden-narket,'whitli ix much required. M3r.

'After this day we shall see what it is to be done-see if the Duko will take0 his proprty back before the expily of the present lease.

t ffiOAfDO2Z, TUESDAY, JABCH 18, 1858. * With all deference to the ex-First Lorde of the Admiralty, who thought. it necessary to warn the -ommander of. the Baltic Fleet so emphatically ginst yielding to the public impatience for re--ults, we are bound to admit that the British public ae now suffering some excuable anxiety. We did not plunge into war on light grounds or 4ter short provocation. For a century we have .d warnings, and for half that period the whole -race- of politicians who devote themselves to what .xre caled European quetions have prophesied -4hD tisic we shoild one day fnd on our hands. .Of course, therefore, now that the occasion has .Arrived, and the task is said to be done, it in lut natural and proper that people should -wish to mnow whether it is well done,, whether it is done to last and hold together, or -whether it is only botched and bungled, to deceive the eye. But, while we respect this . uriosity, and cannot enter into the humour with swhich ome who are behind the scenes affect to rile with it, we very much question whether people in general have considered, not what they .re to expct, but what basis they are to take for their expectations. No doubt, there are those -who expect a great deal, and who have cut and - arved their expectations into very definite forms. With the aid, of maps and treaties they have. formed anticipations which would relieve the Conference at Paris of an immensity of trouble, could it only be brought to agree upon them. We have seen lists of concessions to be extorted -from Russia tas long as that -which our Barons presented ta King JoTmf in the meadow of - Runnymnede, or that which WITLIx IML ac- -cepted as the conditions of his throne. There is -6thing so easy to sumn up, nothing on which 4!ie memor, is so exact, the imagination so inven- and pen or tongue so fluent, as grievances, 13gainst whomsoever or whatsoever they can posv,)lTbe urged. The t;ruth i½ most people labour e*r that- species of egotism Fwhich makes them ;lihe centre of their own system, and supposes it ha duty of all the world -besides to be perpetually -nidesing an unconscious homage to their own xuperior claims. In order, therefore, to bring ihem to reason, it is neesary to move the pre-i4~m- e.ion----'5 Area hey the- centres of the uierse-2 Has nobody else an individuality X and position, a heart and soul, a reputation and "ps cause, a past and a future, to be respected besides themselves t" For our own part, we have always deprecated s ny attempt to define too particularly what have leen c1ed the objects of the war; and, whether au. 4iounOing hasty concession or in cherishing the hopes of peace, we have uniformly abstained fonm committing ourselves to this or that precise zHpWation. We did this for the simple and avowed reason that the basis of the peace, when iil should come at last, must be the existing condition of the belligerent parties. We have rep2atedly urged that we might justly and righteously demand more from Russia, in the event of her complete prostration, than we could this time last year, when the actual events of the war were not so greatly against her, and when our own misforbtnes were the very grounds OIl which we were told to.make peace on any terms. We also warned Russia that, in the event of her persisting in the war, she would prdolbly have to submit to harder terms; implying thereby a premium, if we may so call it, on - prompt and generous confidence in the pacific ,itections. of the'allies. That is the doctrine which we still maintain on the eve of that day waien the actual results of this terrible episode wlu be declared to. the world. The only fair, endurable, and abiding basis for a treaty is the actual condition of the belligerents, as far as it can be appreciated and reduced to a common measure. aX course, a treaty of peace is something more thaa a perpetual arnistice, and. there must be a grext deal of give and take before an actual positicn of affairs can be represented in the' language of fixed relations and permanent insti- tutions. If Russia has no fleet in either sea, on the other hand she still retains more than. half her navy; if the allies hold the southern side of Sebastopol, she still bids us stern defiance ~across the narrow harbour; if we have levelled one fortress and burnt the arsenal. of another, Russia in thne Baltic still baffles our .ruis,er'watches :th6'departure of our fleets to prepare operations for her future defence, nd, by the aid of Prussia, outwits all our attempts at blockade. If we have destroyed a whole chain of fortresses on the eastern shore of the Black Sbea, Russia' -has -advanced her armies ;nto Asia M1inor, "and won - a signal success in the capture of an important position. As for exhaustion, it is true that Russia is probably more :drained, of! men and of money than she was even after the terrible efforts with which she repelled the invasion' of 1812. No doubt peace is very welcome to her; but, on the other hand, the war has not been without cost to the allies. Never before did France draw so largely on the pecuniary resources of her thrifty and industrious people, and it is not to be supposed the drain has- failed to tell. For ourselves, it may be said, and said with entire truth, that never were we so well prepared for war as we are at this moment.. Never were our army and navy in such complete armament, or in such fighting condition. Our own pecuniary resources are almost untouched, and there is scarcely any reasonable sum of money we might not borrow on fair terms to-morrow. But canwecarry.on thewar alone? And will it bewisae to break with France and thus range all Europe against us ? Though it may seem a paradox, the allies hav3 certainly done less than might have een rteasonably .expected, and the Rjuaians have suffered more. Russia hag preserved her character for imramunity from Invasion, but she has done so at a cost which could not be long continued without being fatal to the existence not only of the empire, but of the very race. She has learnt, that in grasping at a shadow she endangers not only her possessions, but her being. We also know by this time that she will admit with the best grace what in justice and reason she could never quite deny,-the independence of her weaker neighbours, and their claim to guarantees against further encroachments. If the Conference gives us that which, irrespective of our owvn preconceived opinions, we are satisfied is a durable and honourable peace, then we may congratulate ourselves that we have not fought in vain. If we are to form our expectations on the basis of the present position, it is not unreasonable to expect that the Black Sea shall be open to the commerce of all nations; that Sebastopol shall never again be a standing menace, continually directed against the heart of Turkey; that Russia shall no -longer obstruct [the greatest artery of European trade for the benefit of her own ports; and that in the Baltic, as well as in the Black Sea, she shaU not make preparations which mean either nothing at all or the conquest of some weak and terror-stricken neighbour. Up to this point we have established our ground, and the Plenipotentiaries charged with strildng the balance of the war will hardly venture to undo what is actually done. Of course, there are those who would press for a good deal more, without considering, perhaps, where they are prepared to stop. If we once begin to insist that Russia shall have nonaval armament, no arsenal, no fortified port anywhere, on any sea, or on any river communicating with any sea, that is only to raise the cry " Deemda est Carthago," which can hardly be said to be required, now that we have proved that Russia, is not the invincible and impregnable Power -she has so Iong affected to be. r, theru c, conceive, be no difficulty in seeing what has been thus far found necesary for the. peace of the world, and as little difficulty need there be in malkng the work already done the basis of pacification.
The dream of poets-the theme of demagogues -the opprobrium of statesmen-Poland, that is, the name of' Poland, remains as a distinctive title on the maps of Europe. Could we discern any reasonable probabilities of restoring this famous country to her ancient privileges and her 'ancient duties, we shouldbe the first to join the. eager band a)ho clamour for her regeneration. Who would not rejoice at suCt a conclusion ? Poland, reconstituted upon the eastern frontier of Europe, would form an- effectivo bulwark against the advancing tide from Holy Russia. If at a futuro day fresh misunderstandings and differences should break out between Russia and Turkey, the SULTAN in the hour of his emergency might reckon upon the assistance of his natural a4-Poland. If the two great military Governments of Germany should at any time meditate further aggression upon the shreds of liberty which their subjects stil retain, Poland would be there-the friend of the opptessed, the avenger of sufferings which she herself had so long endured. We are willing to take the proposition in its full extent as it is propoundeed to Us. We put out of the question all dangers which might arise from the turbulent and aggressive instincts of a military republic dovetailed in among despotisms. We wil suppose that no general conflict would arie from theactionof regenerate Poland upon Hungary or upon the Principalities. We will assmne, in a word, that nothing but good would arise from the reconstitution of this famous Power, and consider only the possibility of its restoration. If it can be done without involving Europe in a general war, or-which amounts to the same thing-prolonging and developing the present conflict, we would say at once, let Poland live again, with her old boundaries,, her old traditiona. of.chivalry without her traditions of imsle, and with the sympathies of Europe at her back. The question is-can it be done?, A deputation from the Literary Association of the Friends of Poland had an interview with Lord PALMERSTON on Saturday last for the pumpose of pressing, upon his notice the overpowering claims of Poland to the notice of Europe at the present moment. They were introduced by the Marquis of BR sAD A, who read to the First Minister a memorial embodying the grounds upon which the application was made. England, according to their view of the case, waa bound to advocate the Polish cause in the Conferences at Paris at the present moment because that cause was advocated. by the British Pleniipotentiaries at Vienna in 1815, and because ithe ruler who has now been called to account by the Western Powers has scandalously violated the treaty made at that city 40 years ago. The signaturea of the British Plenipotentiaries, affixedto that docume,t in 1815 in the capital of the Austrian dominions, imply and necemitate the action of Great Britain in favour of Poland in 1856 at the Conferences in the capital of France. Be it so, we 'will not argue the question of principle or obligation, although it is a little hard to say that, because Great Britain on one occaiion advocated she cause of an oppressed people, she is therefore bound through all time to defend their cause by force of arm3. Had it been our province to offer suggestions to the framer of the memorial, we 'would rathor have supported the claim of Poland upon our sympathy and assistance by pointing to the time when England did not advocate her cause than by insisting upon the occasion when she did earnestly solicit the consideration of the Great Powers of Europe for unhappy Poland. Let4this, however, be as it may, we will not inquire too curiously into the 'force of the 'argument of obligation, nor, on the other hand, dispute the grounds of policy upon which the First Minister of England is- urged to be active in the cause of Poland at the present conjuncture of affairs. We consider only the question of possibility. Truth, Itl en, compels us to say that the great crime has been consummated. The scourging, the banishment, the hanging, the shooting, thesystemof organizedmaurder which has prevailed in Poland for upwards of a quarter of a century, have done their work If by Poland be meant a country inhabited by Poles, with the old feelings in their hearts and with the old ideas in their heads, then Poland has ceased to be. The nobles of the old school inhabit Poland no more. What remains of them must be. sought in Siberia or the grave, and, it may be, in the sparse and dispirited coteries of afew foreign capitals. The middle classes were never at any time in Poland of much account, and certainly, if there be any family among them tainted with Polish ideas exiting in Warsaw or: elsewhere at the present moment, -the Russian police must have done their work more negligently than Russian police are wont to do. The town population of Poland is not, however, at present of much account, and, where it is to be found, the tovwns are swarming with Russian soldiery and bristling withRussian cannon. As for the peasantry, it' is an entire mistake to suppose that they have any material knowledge of the former history or recent oppressions of their country. The generation of hardy countrymen who ralied rouud.the defenders of Warsaw, and .wha- met' and conqvered the Russia.ns.ine'efield after the event of 1830, nas passed away. ITowever displeasing the statement may appear in the eyes of those who have been accustomed to consider this point under the influence of a heated imagination, we state it as our deliberate conviction, that the present population of Russian Polaid in the year 1856 cares little and knows nothing about the former position of their country. They have been born under Russian rule-have been educated by Russians as Russians are educated-have been workedby Russian taskmasters-have been watched and punished by the Russian police, until they are reduced pretty much to the condition of serfs in the other districts of that vast prison-house. In a word, the Polish nobles are dead, are in Siberia, or in exile; the rmiddle classes are reduced to non-entity; the peasantry are as completely Russians as a thoroughly Russian Adminisration-the only one they have ever known-can make them. The Poland which actually exisis is not the Poland of history, but a Poland which has been - constituted by Russia for her own purposes. Now, what are the possibilities of restoring this county to her former condition? -Where are the men-where the arns of former days? On the other hand, we must remember that if the regeneration of Poland be made an inevitable condition of the peace, and if Russia should refuse the requisition of the allies, we must be prepared to undertake hostilities of far greater moment than any in which we have been yet' engaged. Austria and Prussia would instantly make common cause with Russia upon such a point, for neither will they disgorge their portion of the spoil. It would in such a case be perfectly reasonable, perfectly in, accordance with good faith, if our ally, the French EMXrRROP, were to say that, if an extension is to be given to the war, he must be entitled to name the conditions upon which he would feel himself justified in involving in it the fate of his dynasty and the fortunes of. his country. Thi is a very grave matter-so gr've, indeed, that we doubt if any French or English statesman would seriously entertain it at the present moment. On 40-o1 g CohiA tIfii, ncd upon those stated above as to the actual condition of Poland, -we think it would have been wiser had Lord PAr;BSxnTox given a more decisive 'answer to the' Polish- deputak tion, and informed them at once that the regeneration or reconstitution of Poland is not to be made one of the conditions of peace.
In a few days the Military Commission which is to hear the defence of the impliiated orimean officers will meet at Chelsea. We shaU thwrefore leave it to decide on the professional reputation of Comnissary-General FDPBRB. One thing is clear from the statement we published yesterday,that this gentleman is no timid antagonist. He boldly denies facts, and is not content with shifting responsibility. He brings forward the late Commnander-in-Chief as authority for much that was done or left undone. He gives his opinion openly against even the recommendations of the Commissioner., and thinks that they have claimed for their practical Suggestions an importance which was not due. The right on most of these pointsTmust remain with those who bring forward the best evidence; as far, however, as we can soe, Mr. FaIzFR's defence, if sustained, leads to this conclusion,-that there were others more in fault than hinself, that he did his best with insuflicient means, and SuCceeded better than ought reasonably to have been hoped. If things were bad, runs the apology in effect, they would have been much worse had not an incomplete and hastily-organized department laboured assiduously, with littile help from those in the highest authority. It is difficult to give by details a just notion of Mr. Fxnm; s answer. We must be content with recounting one or two of the charges made against his department, with his replies to them. The chief accusation brought against the Commissary-General was a want of forethought, a defect which in his position must entail the deepest calamities. This very grave charge he is naturally anxious to repel, and as a proof of his solicitude for the future he quotes several documents. The question of fuel, respecig which his conduct had been impugned, is not the first in oider, but maiy, from its importance, be at once noticed. It will be remembered that the Commissary-General was said to have denied his liability to find fual at all. *" The Commissariat maintained," say the Commissioners, "that it was not the practice of the "service to issue fuelto troopB in the field ; that a "soldier was not entitled to a ration of fuel except "in barracks." They then say that on the 11th of November Lord RAGLAi had instructed the Commissary-General to prepare a supply of fuel for the ensuing winter, and on the 4th of December directed the issue of rations of it to the troops. Delay occurred, it is said, in the issue of this necessary. NoW, Mr. FnDIR, to prove his foresight, gives us in an appendix his memoranda on the subject. He proves that as early as August 1, when at Varna,, he called the attention of Lord RAiGoL to this point, among many others. Supposing that the army,. or a part of it, were to winter in Bulgia, he advised that "arrangements for lodging and "provisioning the troops should be commenced "without delay." " It would," says he, " be neces"sary- to construct ovens capable of baldng bread "for the probable number of troops to be cantoned "at each station." " The provision of fuel is a "matter of great importance ;" and, as there might bea difficulty in laying in an adequate supply of wood, he suggests "whether coals obtained from "the mines of - Heraclea might not be made avail"able? ] HEl even points out that in one case barrack roomas "w ould have to be fitted ip 'with "stoves, anda in the other with chinmeys." The answer of Lord RAGLA2, is simply, "II will speak "with MIr. FnDLR." It may be that, as orders had been given for the invasion of the Crimea; the Commander of the Forces did not think it neces- sary even to discuss matters connected -with passing the winter in Bulgaria. Six weels elapsed, and great events had taken place. The armament of the aJlies had embarlked, and after a week of fortunate navigation was about to descend on the hostile soil. On the 13th of September, the day before the ianding at Old Fort, Mr. FrLDER again addresses Lord RAGLAx. His letter is dated,i "At Sea, steamship Hope." The letter shows forethought, if no very prophetic intelligence. He reminds the General of the memorandum of the lat of August, and again calls his attention- to the arrangements necessary for provisioning and lodging the troops, and "particularlyfor " laying in a store of wood, the construction of "ovens, and the necessary preparations for execut"ing the niore important contracts." Mr. FnnDx'S reason for being thus importunate is, that there will be scarcely time " before the termination of "the present expeditionary service!' to get things ready for a comfortable- -winter at. Scutari However, if the Commissry-General was, like tthe rest of the world, too sanguine, he was by no means defici6nt in proper solicitude. Lodging, provisions, and fiaing he brought under the -notice of -lIord RAGM at a suffilciently early season, and askded for authority to make arrangements. Lord RBAGeg' answer in September is brief, like that of the monuth -before,-" I cannot give these oirders .a the present "moment." At last, on the 12th of QO;'er Ir. FDEPw , being calued upon j;,mItborinate Mr. 12th *nsk. a ilnai representation and on the * v 2th of October Lord R.E&Giz answers, " I think I " it -will be better at once to make arrangements c for a sipply of firewood for 20,000 or 25,000 | men.". Into the question of how far each divimion was supplied, and to what degree men near Balalilava fared better- than thosel further off, we shall not enter. -We have given this episode in detail, because Mr. FnDZn. justly relies on it to prove that he took early -thought about matters even beyond his own department, and that, so ! far from declining to supply fuel,: he had reiterated Ihis demands for authority to purchase and store sufficient quantities. On some points MIr. FLDp}t intrenches himself behind the regulations, and, if he does not claim merit, at any rate defies the world to prove him blameable. Limejuice had never been supplied by the Co6nmissariat, and therefore it was not sup-. plied in the Crimea. Some arrived fromEngland, and the medical department was apprised of the fact; but, as none was asked foi, none was issued. 'When an order appeared directing the issue it was obeyed, and thenceforth the Commissariat did its best to keep up the supply. With respect to rice, the Commisswy-General could not take on himself to issue it regularly when he had not horses to carry it up, but when there were the means it was duly supplied. As to the expediency of issuing, any food on sanitary groundcs Mr. Fnmix is explicit --" The Commissariat has no knowledge o"f the particular articles of diet which are best "suited to the troops. This is within thepeculiar province of the military and medical officers." The Commissary-General therefore declines all responsibility for the omission to issue any unusual ; food that was not asked for. Something similar is the defence of the green coffee. It was issued in pursuance of the judgment of a Board, which so decidedly preferred coffee to tea that "Sir G. "BROWx who was President, and who objected I" to coffee, felt hiMself constrainec to give up his . "opinion." "In deciding upon coffee," says r. Finnxn, " the Board well knew that it was sold "to the troops in a green state." ! So goes on Mr. Fimxi.u, at times victorious in his arguments, at times by no means convincing, but always self-confident. We can wel fancy that the Government and the Commission will i find him somewhat-diflicultc to. aOl. *it_ Our own opmion has been before expiessed. That Mr. Fnnn -is a genius, or even a! -man of much power of organization, no -one can believe; but that he or his department wras solely or even chiefly to blame is certaily not proved; indeed, the more the characters of the chief officers in last year-s army are understood, the more wonderfui does it appear that so much was done by the unhappy department which every one abused, and on which every one threw as much as possible of his own duties. At any rate, the British army was fed; if the food wras not of the best, and was sometimes short in quantity, there was some excuse for the hastily organized body of rmen who laboured hard to supply even what was consumed. . "I had," says :NI. FRmaxa, from the first, an insufficient establishment "both of officers and subordinate ernplay&s, "further weakened by the great amount of sick"ness and mortality which prevailed." "The "officers had to be collected from the most distant "parts of the empire-from Sierra Leone, the "Cape of Good -Hope, and New South WIales "-and, of course, by slow degrees." The wonder seems to be that this hasty levy, and the Treasury clerks who were sent out to assist them, were able to achieve so much. Whatever shortcomings Mr. FILDER may have been guilty of will, no doubt, receive the censure of the Chelsea Commision, but the world in general will - think that there were others whose offences have been far greater, while the treatment they have received has been widely different from his.

! SECOND EDITION. !~ I!THE TZMEX OFFICE, Ti&ady MuigW. I. EXPRESS FROM PARIS. IThe following is the letter of our Paris correspondent, dated yesterday, 6 p.m.- The foUowing bulletin was issued to-day at the Tuilerie3: I AC 7 ON "The health of the Empress is exceedingly satisdtory.

The reports of Prince Jerome's health are also favourable, and the bulletin of this morning announces that the Prince had some sleep, and that his state was satisfactory. One of the chamnberlains of the Emperor will remain every day, from 9 o'clock in the morming to 6 in the evening, in the apartment on the ground floor in the Pavillon de Flore, in order to Tzke' , such persons as may present - thlerves to have news of the Empress. .a to communicate to them the bulletinB *- the phys.icianLs of the household ^v ~the Emperor williasue twice a day. It is. certain thatiK many years past nothing like the illuminations of last night, in honour of the infantPrince, hasbeen witnessedin Paris.- I donot allude to the mere nmagnificence of the decorations, or to the art with -which the brilliant display was arranged, but rather to the universality of the manifestation; neither do I so much notice the illuminations in the great thoroughfares, such as the Champs Elya6es, the Boulevards, the rae Royale, rue de la Pain, sc., but the Iess frequented streets, the byways as it were, which stand apart, if not remote, from the great centre of movement. I pased through several of these back streets and lanes in more than one quarter of the capital, where, I believe, no lights were ever hung out before, aud i found that there 'were few indeed without their illumination-some of the most modest idnd, it is true, but all evincing goodwill on the part of the occupants. In some streets off the Boulevards, ordinarily not much frequented, several houses were lighted up in all their storeys.- The blaze of gas from the Ministry of Marine and the Garde-Meuble lighted up the whole of the Place de la Concorde, and the Legislative Chamber was beautifuly designed in flame. Coloured lamps were suspended along the railings of the garden of the Tuileries, and the rue de Rivoli looked an endleEs avenue of light. The Hotel de 'Vile was magnificently decorated; its fapa3e, covered with fags and escocheons, displaying the Imperial arms. The oriflammes that floated in the wind were marked with the date " 16th MIarch, 1856." Perhaps the most tasteful as well as most brilliant decoration was the triumphal arch erected in front of the 33ourse. At the top in coloured lamps were the words "Au Prince Imperial l" and at either side " Vive rEmpereur 1" and " 'ive I rIMp6ratrice!" At the opening of the arch wera suspended coloured lamps. At the sides were 'Venetian masts with streamers, on which were inscribed the words " Vive rEmpereur, Vive rImpdratrice. Confiance, Skcurit6,Crdit, Prosperitd r' in gold letters. The effect was so admirable, that during the whole of the evening crowds of persons thronged the place to gaze upon it. The Boulevard was one line of light from the Madeleine to near the Bastille. Crowds of foot passengers were constantly on the move, notwithstanding the rain, which, though not very violent, fell incessant ly from an early hour in the evening. The domes of the Pantheon,Val-de-Grace, the Invalides, and the ancient towers of Notre Dame, and the spires of St. Jacques stood out in bright relief from the -sombre sky; and, wherever the eye could reach, coloured lights, disposed in capricious forms and of varied tints, presented an enserle the most picturesque. Prom the Faubourg St. Honord the illuminations extended a long way beyond the Barrimre du Roule to the 7illages of the Thertaes and Champeny, Neuilly,j Courbevoie, Asnieres, Suresnes, as far asthe eye could penetrate. Among the public edifices the Palais Royal, the residence of the Princes Jerome and Napoleon, was not the* least remarkable for the richness and taste of the- decorations. A cordon of light marked the-architectural proportions of the fafade, and immediately over the entrance the Imperial escocheon wras displayed, the ninutest lines ana details of which were accurately desEgnated inflame. To the right and left two eagles with wings outstretehed were encircled by flags and shields. The buildings of the New Louvre were lighted up with gas, and the effect produced by the reflection of the white stone of which they are composed was very fine. About 10, however, the rain came down so thiclly as to thin the crowd, and byhalf-past U o'clock thsa dense masses had disappeared. The illuminations too were a good deal damaged by wet. The news of the birth of the l?rince was received in the departments at ' o'clock yesterday morning, and, according to aL accounts, was -very well received. Letters from Havre state that the ships were dressed out in all their flags, and the theatre and public edifices illuminated. At 9 o'clock the guns of the citadel of Lille announcedthe fact to the citizens, who received it with every demonstration of joy. At Beauvais great satisfaction was manifested; and at Lyons, yesterday, after vespers, the Te Deum was chanted in the cathedral in thanksgiving for the event. The Moniteur announces that the Emperor and Empress will be the sponsors of all the legitimate children born yesterday in France; On the occasion of the birthof theImperialPrince the foirowing theatres were opened to the public, free, this day, at -2 o'clock;.-The Opira, Th6itre Erancais, Op6ra Comique, Odeon, Theatre Lyrique, Vaudeville, Variftis, Gymnase, Palais Royal, Porte St. Martin, GaitM, Ambiga Conique, Cirque Imprial, and Cirque Napoleon. Long before the hour appointed for the opening an immense number of people had assembled outside the different houses. The cost of these entertainments was at-the expense of the Civil List, and at all the theatres the first artistes performed. The following, in additiontotheirordinary'performances, gave something appropriate to the occasion:-At the Grand Opera, a) cantata was executed; at the ThAtre Frauas, an ode on the birth of the' princehnperial; OpDra Conique, a cantata; Odeon, Le 16 Mars; Th6atre Lyrique, a cantata; Vaude" ville, L-Espoir de a .Fraace; 'Varijt6s, Le Bereatt Imperial; Palais Royal, 101 Cotsps de Carnon; Porte St. Martin, Dire issement AlUlgoripte ; GaYtt,L,'Enfalt de la France; Ambiga Comique, A la Voix dil Canon; and at the Cirque Imperial, a cantata. Every theatre was crowded, generally with persons in the lower classes of society, and better conductedl audiences it was impossible to find anywhere. On the occasion of the happy delivery of the Empress a Tc Dez m was sung, and prayers of thanksgiving offered up yesterday in all the j churches of the Reformed Church in Paris and the' banlieue. Thesame wi take place on Sunday next in the other parts of the Consistorial circuniscrip. tion. On Sunday next a Te Dertm will be sung at Notra Dame and in all the churchea of France.

A slight inaprovement has manifested itself in the commercial situation of Paris, which wi necessaxily assume a greater development -when peace is pro. claimed. Orders are daily rc3eived from raussia, both in Paris -a-nd at tyonf, and- -,a- -jroac coronation of the Emperor Alexander II. prot raises to afford the. manufacturers of both cities employment during the whole spring.

In. portant orders reached from the Thnited States by the last packets. 3Money had become more abundant at New York-, and the merchandize lately im. ported from Europe had found ready sale and on advantageou-s temns The rapid decline -which took place the week before in the price of cereals had been suldenly checked in Paris, by mere locl canses. The best sorts of faour had fallen at one maoment as low af 88f. per sack of 159 k-ilogmmnes. O Monday, however, some bakers having made laige purchases, and the accountsfrom the departments showing an improve. ment, the Parisian millers took advantage of thee circumstances to raise the price to 95f. and even 9Sf. M This ise, however, did not rnsinti itself, and at the close of the week the same quality of flour could be had at 92f. The stock remaining in the halle on Satu=aay was 32,416 metrical quintals. Wheat scarcely de. clined If. per hectolitre and a half. At the Iat market of Poissy, calves alone maintined their high price. The Paris butchers continue rebellious to the Prefect's ordinance relative to the sale of meat, notwithstanding the strict surveillance exercised by the authorities. On Saturday as many as 52 were cited before the Tribunal of Police for violat. ing that ordinance, by adding bones to the meat, selling one category for another, or mixing them, refusing to give bills, &c. All were - convicted and fined from 3f. to 15f. 10 of them, whc, had been already condemned once or twice were sentenced to one, two, and five days' imprison. raent. The wine trade, which had been rather dull at Bercy, in consequence of uniavourable accounts from the south, has recoveredsome activity. Numerous tranFactions were concluded during the week at the high rates of last autumn. Little or no business is doing in spirits. Languedoc brandy sells in Paris at 160f. per hectolitre, and spirits extracted from beet at 97f. and 98f. At Bordeaux the former only fetches 146f., and the latter 102f.

THE CITY PO:XICE. TO TE EDITOiROF THE TlIES. Sir,-The Ist of April beingthe day feLxd for the Gover. ment onslaught on the abuses of the Corporation of the city of London, Ipray your assistance for a body of men, the highest praised, but wrorst used of al, who serve under itS hield9. I am a city police-constable, and aure you the members of that body are looldng anxiously for an amalgamation with the metropolitan police, for zeasons that will, I hope, gain yoqr. advocac, and thus spur the Governent on in their good intentons; but I will briefy submit theier.es ance for your consideration, which Ithink will make even you exclaim "Can suchtbinsber' The City Police Act states, m clause No. 12, "that itshal .be lawful for theCommons in Council assembled to order that any of the said constables hang served with diligenos i;d-lQa;i0ar n 7 = uon the cerificate of the com missoner thatsZ ei F incapable from i ury or d body to discharge the duties of his office, be superannuated and receir'ethereupnon out of the City Police Superannuation Fund a yearly allowance of not more tfian half his pay." :But nowr, Sir, for the treatment the memubers of the force receive at the hands of the Polce Cmmittee, who unfortunately have the distribution of the said fund. After 15 years'service, and being returned unfit for furtherdutiesb thosurgeon of the force, hehas "to humbly. petition their hon. Court" to ldndly consider his distressed circumstsnces, having a wife and four children (as the case maybe) wholly depending upon him for support. UDO presenting his petition tho fo(owing scene literally ikes place.- Member of Court, addressing applicaut.-" How old are You" AppEcnt.-" I47."

Yoa look 'well enough, and could soon get work. Well, all 'we can do for youis to allowr you 7s. per wresk for 12 months, at the end of which time you can apply to the Court again.' At the expiration of 12 months applicant again applies. Applicant.-"I hope, gentlemen, you won't drive me and my family to the workhouse, for may affliction entirely inc'pecitates me from any employment." MTember.-" Ah 'weil, 'we can't help that - we shall lloow you Ss. per week for three months, and you must not come-here agamn." Yes, Sir, this is the closing scene of a man who for 15 years has honourably and faithfully served in protecting the lives and property of the citizens of London ! Should this be doubted, the City Police Commissioner (who should have the distribution of the fund, the same as the 3Ietroritan Commissioner, and then the men would be justly dealt with) could furnish a list of similar instances.' Suppose the poor applicant should in the course of his diutise. have summoned either the "butcher, the baker, or candlesticimaker," of whom "the hon.

What c6uld the man do butsteal?e :eestablished a regular tariff of bribery, where-everything' had its price. Andthis is not a solitary instance, it is a system. The old feudal and hereditary. chiefs in the provinces certainly practised exiction,. and were alt6gether beyond the control of the Central Government; but as they were, -with rare eiception3s, -ei of their position,it w- a vs in-their-interest to see thei inhabitants prospetous, whereas moderm Turkish officials must try to mak-e money as quickly as possible, for next day-they may be recalled. -; People usually think that thing3 are going on0 I badly in the provinces because the central Govern- I inent has no authority there. On the contrary,' it is because the central - Government Ia -too much of it; and -fils all posts wiih its creatu'res, as corrupt asit is itself. As all violent changes are liable to lead to extremes, so it hagle-b6n. the case with the new reformers in Tuakey. Formerly, when the military and civil power were unted m the hands of the governors, the empirea was brought to the brink of perdition by the'independent position which the provincial governoras am ed. The main tendencv of the new .reforms was therefore directed against this power. The separation of the civil - and miltary power' of the governors was the fist step in this. respec t,-the gradual removal of all the native families vrho had occupied posts in the provinces from father, Xo 'sonwas another, and thus by degrees the central Government in Constantinople fettered so entikely the hands of its instruments in the provincejthat even the most salutary. movement becomes imposiible. Ais longas-this centralization is kept up the provinces will always remnain a prey to the goldthirsty officials sent from StambouL Even. the most judicious exercise:of Conmilarpowerisi:nlyr a very feeble check,, and the occasional dismissal of: a Pasha is a warning laughed at by his more * Not to be confounded with the Commander-in-Ohie. .: --,, .

The Padisbah, is great, and so are the Western Powers, but Stamboul is far off, and the Ambassadors too; the roads are badj and so is likewise the official world of Constantinople. Thea conseguence is, that whether we look to Asia or Europe, we find everywhere-the sane-Pashas who t!xve the troop; Pashas who ruin the inhabitants Vby their exactions, Pashas who sell justice and offices,. Pashas who wink at brigandage ; in a word, Pashas who fill their bottomless pockets under various plea3 ,and in different ways. J- the face of all thes abusa the repremnta;veg of. the Westein Bawers, who feel bound to interfere whenever any of these abuses come to their knowledge; ought to possess the power of ubiquity, for tr elaims on their help are as many as those on the sorvimce of Beaumarchais' Figaro in the goodly 'towvnof "geyille, T here is 'ust now a rather interesting case of this kind taken u both by the, English and FTench Ei-. .bhmies.

Sir,-rIn a -recent debate -in the HEouse of Comnotu serious -charges were made against Government for the bad .qualities of their supphes; for the irregulaity with which their contracts were :fulfilled; and for the frauds which were'- sometimes committed.; -and hence was founded an argument for Government becoming their own manu. facturers. These charges are,-inzgreat measure, true. It is right, however, .the public -should know with whom the blame rests; and whether the fact is really that the honesty -of ;British traders-and the ability to produce articles of fi*rA rafe quality have departed from this commercial country; or, rather, -whether the fault lies with those who now wish to cover their own blunders by making these sweeping chargds against the manufacturers of England. If the fact. were correctlystated byMr. Monsell, England would, indeed, have reason to blush for the honour of her commercial popu. lation; but I think the following remarks will prove that the fault istobe traced to a-cause carefullykept out of the public sight. : ;UThe system of contfrats adopted: by the Government irn genera' and by -the War, Department in particular, is vi6ious in the extreme, costly boyond all comparicon, and domoralizing to the trading communaity. tord Palmerston justly observed;in tho debate in questi?n, that every article of warlike stores ought to be of the ;very,best quality that cQuld be produced,andthat any other was useless. Nothing can be more true than-this. Bat howv does the War Department endeavourto procure tbeae uAexceptionable articles? ' Their contracts aregiven to Oe lowest tenderer, whoever-he 'nay be. No nsmtte.- how long andliow well a manufactuanr has served thsm; no mattelhow high the quality of his goods stands in te estimatiofr ,of the trade at large; no maioer how great the expense he hs incurred to produce a maerWial suited to ihe class of gbods required by the Goveraaent-if any ether person e-a be found wrilling to undert2e a contractfIor one per reent. less tlm their. long-tried uedapprovyd manulfacturer, 'there'eapermanhaathe contract gi7entohim, nomatter what :lis character maj be, or whetlcr -he has any character at all. The comequence is that manufacturers; run one a*anst another in brace for cheapness. Whatever; there. foroe is gcod enoegla just to pass tie examinaticnpand no xere, is al they carn give, is all tha_ are boundto give, and i*al9they.conreallyaffordtogive.

U-t1erly disclaiming being influenced by any such .feelings, Isaubinit the following facts:- -, In November, 184'4 an anonym6us letter was forwvarded to the Commander-in-Chief containing -cherges of a very grave nature against me; then commanding theist Regi,ment of Life (uardm ana to those charges I was ofidically ordered to rpl;y. I did so. In an interview which I had with the AdjutantGeneral I stated to him that I felt sure I knew the writer of the anonymousl letter in question, and that I should retain it to test the accuracy- of my belief. I acoidin-gly lost no time in showiing the anonymous letter to the senior officers of the regiment, separately, and yithout giving them the 1ightest intimation of my own- uapicion as to the writer. They one and all declared their belief that the handwriting was that of Lieutenant-General Cavendish. 'I iieit handed the anonymnous letter to the ore4ly-rooits clerk, who -had been appointed to that situation by Lieutenant-General Cavendish, and hat served in that capacity- under him for three yers and a-ha.1f, saying to Ahim, "ILook at that " helsaid, "1-aM sorTy Xtsee it; hadInot seen it mnyself, I could not have believed it."

About noon a chimney took din fi the farmhouse of Mr. Pilcher, wlwn a flake of bura'. soot fell upon a hayrick and sot fiat on fire. It 'bou spread so rapidly that the house, outbuildings, and stacks and ricks were very speedily burmt to tle grouid. The fire haying been seen by a sentinel sat the eaup of the British-German Legion at Shorniliffe, it waa inimediMtelv reported, when a large body of cavalry and iwantry, wi three engines, proceeded with great haste to the spot, and, the place having been surrounded by the infantry, the other troopa went to work in geod style, but from want of water theycouldnotarresttheprogress of theflames.

The German troops were soon preseut, and-rendered most valuable and effective, service in savjingProperty, although the mill was completely gutted. One o the German cavalry brought out on his back more thau 20 acks from amid the fie, and the greatest praiso is due. to the Le on zorzueir prompt asistance.

NATIONAL INSTITUTION OFFINE ARTS. *Oii the principle that ever ain's a Aright t-i I official nme5-ve gi:veto tEieSociety of Painters, I whose nintlhannual exhibition was opened yesterday 1 -toS the-pulic, thetitle th at'pears on thq first page of th6 catalog\ue, although4we shrieiadly suspect that: *boide&the.,members them.ieves -few -of our-readera. will. exactly k-now what or whereabouts -isn the -fine .old-: or .fieliew -ifiititiltioni th'at stands' before- the world as,the "ational - Istitution of: Fine -Arts.' The :fiit.-rush, of ,iconjectulre will. probably -be towards -the-Society of iArts, in Jocbh-street; Adelphi,. famed for its patronage -of d66orative genius andits-series of -pictures by Barry.. However, directly we.drop the -official designation, and use the popular name O" Portland- Gallery," everybody will- begin toi exercise his imagination in ,the right direction. - 'They have not been. very happy in the selection of their title,-those authorities of Northern-Regent-street. At the iirst glance there really appoears nothing "national" about them,- beyond the m ere fact that the artists whose works they exhibit are for the most part British subjects. Generally this sane imposing adjective, ".national" implies something distinguished from the me'rely individual,something, as it were, representative of the nation ea, masse. The most grandiloquent man -would scarcely venture to-term his tailor's bill, a portion of, the National Debt. - Now, the so-called "iNational Institntion of Fine Arts is the very perfection of individuslity, the exhibition directly representing nothing-but the artists whose works are exhibited. He who formed a graduated scale of institutions, distinguished fror each othw by the deeper or less deep submersion of the individual in the general body, might' put Plato's Republic at one end and the "National Institution of Fi-ie Arts" at the other.- There seems tobe-no stern body -of adjudicators in the background, supposed mythically to represent or Pygtl4ally to express the -taste ofi the 3nation at - large. The artists rent a certAin- number of iquare feet, and hang up their ;ownn pictures accordigly, under the inil& 'control of' a ruling power that just prevents thae worst works from getting into the best places, and thlus upholds in some degree the dignity of the right line, That this isthe iinut to which the executive action of the Portland government extends one might conclade from the works that find their way into the gallery. The visitor who, not content to look at what isboldly set before him, must needs pry into obscure nooks andc corners will see strange sights. Nevertheless, the annals of the society prove that there is a power of absolute rejection, however dormant it may have become, and that occasionaLly it has been exercised. Surely the works rejected by the Portland Gallery, andconsequentlydeemedunworthy of hanging themselves at their owvn expense, might be collected into a museum of curiosities. The free constitution of the Portland Gallery contributes to endow it with a peculiar interest. When every mani may do just as he pleases, one has, at any rate, a chance of finding out general predilections; and if we duly reflect upon this truth we may perchance arrive at the conclusion that the title "National Instit'tious" is not without some sort of significance, after all. The artist, in the absence of an adjudicating committee, has but two parties to think about-himself and the public; and therefore he freely follows either his own inclination or what he conceives to be the inclination of the masses. - The general tendency to the small in art cannot be more clearly exemplified than in the present exhibition. Landscapes, for the most part not on a grand scale, largely predominant; sketches of domestic life fondly chosen; studies of anrials, usually of the tame kind; and all tiis unrelieved byany striking reminiscence of history or poetry-such a collection cannot surely be an index altogether valueless. Moreover, the Portland Gallery has an aristocracy of its own. Those "stats" who dazzle atthe Royal Academv exhibition, sparkle at the British Institution, or twinkle at the Suffolk-street Gallery, do not care to shed their rays in this fourth heaven, and hence we find that the chiefs- of Regent-street are composed partly of those who are less prominent elsewhere, partly-of those for whom no " elsewhere" exsts. On this account a visit to the exhibition of the -" National Institution of Fiiie Arts' is not - altogether uninstructive. The atmosphere is alto- gether different from that of every other gallery, -and as the spectator will scarcely be gujided by the names in his catalogue, he will the -more independently direct his attention to the works themselves. *When a number of humanities are allowed to move about with-perfect freedom, like will gene-rally congregate with like.- Hence the Portland Galery will sometimes more or less represent certain schools of art. Inthe early days of pre-Raphaelitism, when that theory did not show itself in the softened form which it now assumes, but promised (or threatened) to convert every square foot of canvass into the semblance of an illuminated MS., this partidular gallery was the scene of its most eccentric manifestations. Here saints figured with halos really gilt in the true medizeval style, and gallants disported themselves after the angular fashion preEcribedinStrutes Games. This phasehas passed away, and if we now look for the prevailing feature in the Portland Gallery, we shall find it consist of a certain solid kind of landscape, of which the chief master is Mr. S. R. Percy. IHis " Storm gathering on Cader Idris" is a tyDical specimen of the style. The sky looks heavy with water, the mossy foreground is heavy with its own substantiality; a deepened hne, produced partly by the natural colour of the objects, partly by the shade into which they are cast, is spread broadly over the larger portion of the picture, and the eye is almost surfeited .by the accumlation of richness. To the dark mass the light break of the sky comes as a sudden contrast, though even the bright clouds partake of thesolid character of the whole. Another reprez sentative of the class is Mr. Alfred W. Williams whose " Approaching Storm" is similar 'in almost every particular to the picture just described, with more varied means for the distribution of sudden light. One might almost imagine that the force of Mademoiselle Rosa Bonheur's colouring had inspired these artists, to -whom maybe added Mr. Walter Williams (" Moel Siabed," 147, with a feeling of emulation. The "Forest of Stone iPines on iFire at the Zuyspitz," by Mfr. Bridell, with the fantastic crags opposing their various surfaces to the red light, and the pool of water in the foreground, cool and m-ilumined amid the general glow, and the "'Summer Eve by Haunted; Stream," by Mr. A. W. H. Hunt, in which the- smudgy character of the trees and reflected clouds somewhat carry out the notion of a preternatural gloom, are likewise above the general level. The moonlight scene "In the Highlands," by Mr. A. Gilbert, "darkly. deeply, beautifully iblue" 'over its entire surface, may arrest the eye as a pictorial eccentricity. Of landscapes of theordinarykind-s<nrenirs of English by-waysand what not-there is a large quantity; and we may say that, on the whole, the Portland Gallery body docs itself credit in this department. Numerous, too, are those smuall picturesof modern and medieeval life which, now The- historic and epic sre gradually dwindling away, always exclusively maintain the connex:ion between painting and the fortunes of humanity. Shakspeare is an inemhaiistible source for the painiers of brief episodes, who, -though they will- not* venture on a complicated scene,- Iove to embody their thought of some individual character in some partic-llar situation. Among these Mr. H. S. M1arks makes himself rmore -than usually con- spicuous. His mind seems to take him naturally to the more grotesque- personages of the great poet, and he always embodies them in an original manner. No stage performance could have Suggested his composition of the " Gravedigger's Riddle' from Hanlet, with the First Gravedigger, a pert young, man, seated carelesaly on the tombstone, and the second, his senior by many years, leaning puziled on his -spade. The " Ancient and Quiet Watchman"slumbering athispost, the smooth-faced, 3oyous "Autolyous," are equally original-the woris of a man who has an mterpretation of his own, and can express it by unmistakable signs. Almost identical in subject, in manner, even to the hardness of the outline, and the peculiar way of folding the drapery, is DI~r. Rossiter, whose "Fluellen compelling Pistol. -to eat the Leek'" is one of the notabilities of this present exhibition. ML-. Provis's B13xeton Cardplayers," Mr. Hodgson's "Going Out" (a young lady putitg on her bonnet before a mirror), the "Attendant" (with a somewhat awkward arm) in the " daintily-furnished old hall" by Mr. Pasmore, and the smiling "Orange Girl' of Ar. Collinson may be picked out-rather arbitrarily, perIaps-as agreeable specimens of their kind. As to panters of anmllfe, there are Mr. H. B.

TO THE ED2TOR OF TH-E -TMS. Sir,-Captain the Hon. Augustus Henry Archibald Anson first entered the British army, if Hares Atmy Li-st is to be depended upon, oi the 27th of May, .1853, as an ensign, by purchase, in the Rifle Brigade. The first nineteen months of his career appear to have been spent at the regimental dep6t, dunng which period of service he pbtained his lieutenancy' without purchase; aid on the 8th of January, 1855, 'he is stated to have joined the service companies of the Rifles before Sebastotopol. He served with them duringthe campaign of that summer; but shortly after the capture of Sebastopol(havingin theinterim also obtainedhis captaincy without purchase), Captain Anson appeared in the Gazet as exclhanging from a corps on active service before the enemy in the Crimea into the 84th Regiment, which was pacifically melting awav under the hot suns and unhealthy climate of Burmah ! The Unitied Srvice Gazet of Saturday last explains the cause of this extraordinary proceeding. Captain Anson has no idea,of going to Burinah; his obect is merely to get on the staff of his uncle, the gon. General Anson, Commander-in-Chief in the East Indies, to obtain double pay and double promotion, and to escape all further regimentalduty. The captains in the 84t Reg,iment average 16 years' service each. The lieutenants in, the 84th average nearly eight years' service each. Surely among those gentlemen there must be some meritorious soldier who deserves the advantages of the Staff, and who would discharge its duties at least as well as General Anson's nephew, whom he has thus taken from his duties .in the Crimea to place over their heads. I do not blame Captain Anson for this act, nor do I blame General Anson for it. They have but acted according to the customs sanctioned by the Horse-Guards at home. The real culprits are Lords Hardingae and Panmure. r The latter nobleman made his debut as Mfinister of War in the, character of a military reformer, Which I fear he will scarcely be able to sustain after the Dowbiggiii exposure. 'We havej seen him at the very moment when England was mourning Lord Raglan's loss-when hundreds of British parentswere weeping for their children whose lives 'had been uselessly wasted on the glacis of' the' Redan-when our statesmen, perplexed where to look for military talent, had at last doubtfully decided on General Simpson as a temporary stopgap-we have seen Lord Panmure, I say, at 'such- a moment, in the midst of England's perplexity anid sorrow, availing himself of the very despatch in which he had announced to the overtasked old General the high position which had been forced upon hin in order to obtain for his nephew promotion which he feared he could not obtain on his own mnerits; and, I am sorry to say_ we have heard the -PTemier of Englald declare in Parliament that he thought the content of that despatch redounded to Lord Pamnure's honour ! I am, Sir, your obedient servant, _A:TA-Lk'AX.
GEZM3RAL THEATRICAL FUArD. Yesterday evening the llth anniversary of the "Royal General Theatrical Fund" was celebrated at the London Tavern by the usual banquet. The chair was occupied by Lord Tenterden, and among the more prominent of the guests were Viscount Rlainham, gr B..Webster, hlr. Buckstone, MWr. Wigan, Mr. E. T. Srnith, Mr. Creswick, Mr. Charles Dickens, Mr. Charles Tavlor, Mr. Mark Lemon, hfr. Eobert BelL Captain Chappe ,B.N., Captain Tbbet son, and MIr. T. P. Cooke. T-wo separate galleries were appropriated to the ladies, whowere assembledi mgreat force. Afteranexcellentdinner, distingnishedalike bythe quality of the viands and of the wines, Lord Tenterden commenced the business of the eveningbyproposing "The health of Her Majesty," as an illustrious patroness of the ir.titution and of the drama generally. The subjects of the next toast from the chair were " Prince Albert and the Royal fanily," and Lord Tenterden took occasion to express a hope that the rmince of Wales might some day visit the city, not after the fashion of Harry of Monmouth, but with the intention of taking the chair at some charitable festivity similar to the present. " The Army and Navy," responded to by Cap. tai Ibbetson, Captn appeU, and Mr. T. P. Cooke, and " The two Houses of Parliament," responded to by Viscount Rainham, being next dispoeed of, the chairman cmine to the toast of the evening, " Prosperity to the Royal General Theatrical Fund." He briefly sketched the eariy historyof the drama from the Elizabethan days, when it advanced simultaneously with the nation, to the period of Puritanical oppression, when actors were a proscribed class. The' disadvantage peculiar to the professors of histrionic art, that their obvious excellence passed away with themselves, while that of the sculptor end painter was of long duration, was dwelt upon with the view of showing howespecilyactors were entitled to charitable consideration; and particular stress was laid apon the pantomimic artists, who might so easily be ruined byan accident inthe course of their perilous exploits. The prosperity of the " Fund" being connected with the health of- Mr. BUCESTONE, the treasurer, that gentleman returned thanks accordingly. le explained. the obligations of the society towards Lord Tenterden,whe, though he had accepted tlhe chair at the shortest possible notice, had perforned its duties with so much ability. The old funds attached to the large houses had a Royal Duke as a perpetual president, but the younger institution had to provide novelty and variety-that is to say, to look out. for a new chairman every year. Of the prosperity .of the society he spoke in the most satisfactory terms, recording among other benefits the transfer to its treasury of- the old Coburg fund, to which there were no claimants, and which, through the exertions and integrity of Mr. T. P. Cooke, had been obtained for the general good of the profession. To Mr. Webster, his old friend and schoolfelIfw, he said the thanks of the actors generally were due for his recent exertions to obtain a portion of the Dulwich College property for the education of their children. After a few jokes at the expense of Exeter-hall and its frequenters, Mr. Buckstone honourably mentioned-Mr. CharlesDickensas the best friend to the Fund. The hopea of the French empire hadnot beendisappointed, and he now trusted that the FBnd would find a " thumping boy" namedil" Liberdl Donation." The health of Mdr. Charles Dickens, as a trustee of the 'und, was now formally proposed from the chair. In returning thanks, that gentleman represented that the office of trustee was little more than a sinecure, but, at the same time, avowed that he took a deep interest in the Fund, as a " plain, unpretending reality-," established by actors for the benefit of their class. The recent fire at Covent-garden had seemed to indicate a time when the old separate funds would become extinct, and all contributions for the benefit of the pTofession would find their way into the common stock About this period of the evening the secretary, Mr. Cullenford, read the list of donations,. at the head of which appeared Her Majests annual subscription of 1001. The chairman had presented 10. 10s.; the Duke of Devonshire 101. lOs. annually; Earl Fitzhardinge, 51. annually; Mr. C. Manby, 51.; Mr. B. Webster, 51. ; Mr. C. Kean, 5. 5S. ; Mr.W. Cooke, of Astley's, 51. annually; Mr. W. G. Robson, 101. 10s., and 51. 5s. annually; Mr. E. T. Smith, 151. 15E.; Mr. A. Wigan, 51.; Mfr. Albert Smith. 51. 5s., &c. I-Viscount RAr.'xa having proposed " The health of the noble chairman," Ltord- to"aThT , in reply; stated how he had been attached to the. drama from ihis youth, having been first taken to tho theatre by his father, a man of severe classical taste, who, moreover, on one oceasion had called his attention to the sufferings of the poorer members of the profession. - - ' - MIr. C.-TAYLORs in a -remarkably humorous speech, now proposed "fMr. J. Oxenford, and the dri6natic authors," and Mr. Oxenford, who replied, gave "M r. B. Smith, and the London managers." This was responded to by Mr. -:mith and Mr. Webster, the latter of whomn once more brought before the company the importantasubject of Dulwich College. ".The Iadiese'?proposed by the chairman, was the concluding tout of the aasemblage, which -broke up shortly after 11 o'Cdock. - - . - Among the musical perforanera wo benlivened the eveniig were Miss Lucy Esoott- Miss, oole, Miss R. Isaacs, the Wisses Mascall, Mr. Rans&4, MfasterI;sa theiolinist, and Mr. Rihardson, thc celobratedproformeron tJn flute.

Mr. Nunneley.-Very well, as you please; but we thought it necessary to pteprae this report. The Coroner.-These are Mr. Nnnneley's reasons for aking this course. I have nottaken them down. Mr. Nunmeley.-We thought-this necessary in 'consequence of what. Mr. Barret itated last time as to his desire to have the tests. - ' Mr. Barret.-I want the facts, and not the preface to the facts. The Coroner.-It is well enough to give areason why you did this, but I think -you are now exceeding thc bounds of evidence arid of discretion, and I thinrc,the bestpbn: would be to strike out what you have stated 'and -take: the report whichhasbeenagreedu pn by Mr.:3f6rley and yourself, and which I take it willbe the best. ' mm Nunneley.-Very well, if that is'.your opinion, we will, if yon will give us a little time, strike out what you think is unnecessary; but I must say these are facts which cannot be understood unless we give the reasons. Mxr. Barret.-If Mr. Nunneley will give us the results and the particular tests which gave those results, it ivill Save my cross-exmining. Mfr. Nunneley.-It was really to save the tedious cross-exanination we were.previously,sbjectedtobyMfr. Barret, that we thought it necessary. to go mto th'ese phrticulars. This would be much the shortest course, but'anything you require, Mr. Coroner, we wiMl comply with. The Coroner-I think a report confined to facts is what should be put in evidenoe. Mr. Barret.-And the tests used to produce that result. The Coroner.-There are no tests. There has been no further analysis, but merely the results of an application of a portion of the irituous extract of the contents, of the stomach which had been previously analysed, but not exhausted in the tests. Mr. Barret.-Were the tests the same as were used before ? Mr. Nunneley.-No, there have been no tests used. We have dealt with the remaining portion of the contents of the stomach, but not in the way of an analysis. Our proceeding has been of an entirely different character, and it was to explain that proceeding that we prepared the report I am now reading. The Coroner said he thought it was not necessary to go into those details, and after consulting with the coroner Mfr. Nunneley resumed his seat. Mr. Morley was then recalled, and presented the following report, which heread:- AD DITIONAL REPORT OF THE ANALYSIS OF THE CON- TENTS OF TH}E STOMACH. "As a further test of the presence of poison in -the stomach, and one which as nearlyas possible would'amount to demonstration,-we determined to try whether the spirituou- extract obtained from the contents of the stomach, already shown bychymical tests to contain strychnine, possessed really the poisonous properties of that substance. " We selected for experiment two rabbits, two mice, and a guineapig, and as the most exact method of acting lnpon such animals with small ouantities of poison, we applied it by inoculation through smnall openings, either into the cellular tissue beneaththe-sk-in,orinto one of the serous cavities of the body; alsoin one of the mice, givng a portion by the mouth. " In each of these fiveanimals thus. -submitted to experiment the characteristic effects of poisoning by strychnine were produced. IEthlee efthem'(the two-mice and a vigorous rabbit) death ensued axespqetively in 2 minutes, 12 minutes, and 0r minutes, froi-the' first introduction of pison. The symptoms preced;ng' death were, disturbed respiation, general distress, convlsive twitchings or jerkings, tetanic spasms,:a peculiar outstretching of the legs, and general rigidity of the body-symptoms which are exactly those commonly prewented by strychnine. "Inthe fourth-animal, a rabbit, the symptoms were equally well marked and decisive, bat although the animal lay for a time nearly dead it afterwards revived and eventually recovered. xIL the guinea pig the effects were at first muchmore slight,- the spasms were not so strong as to throw it down or entirely disable it, but on the following day it was found dead,- with the muscles rigid and the hind legs extended, asif from the effects of the poison. "FBor the purpose -of comparison we conducted at the same mime a parallel U Oerz servsrvw: - _.n a with ordinary strychnine. In these animals the symptomswere exactly similar to-those p reduced in.the five acted on by the poison extracted from the bodv of Mrs. Dove. irney were, as a series, nos more severe alac not more rapidly fatal. These animal experiments, which add the test of physiological effect to that of the chymical reagents, decisively confinm our analysis, and, taking-theminconnexion with the analysis a'nd with the symptoms observed duringlife, and with the appearancesnoted in thebody after death, they afford, in our opinion, the most complete proof that the death of rs. Dove -s from the poisonous effects of strychliine, and from no other cause. "< GEORGE MfOIcaEY., "THOAs NuNNNELEY, F.RC.S.E." The Coroner.-Your opinion, Mr. Niunneley, is the same? Mlr. Nunneley.-The report presented by.Mrr; Morley is the joint report of Mr. Morley and myself, and-'is is much the report of one asthe other. The Coroner.-Do you, Mr. Barret% wish to ask any questions? Mr. Barret.-No. The Coroner.-I believe there is no further evidence. The Coroners officer replied that there was not, and the prisoner was then ordered to stand up. T'she Coroner.-William Dove, do you wish to say any. thing to the jury? The Prisoner (in a firm voice).-Nothing at alL The Coroner then proceeded to sum up at half-past 10, and, exclusive of the extracts from the evidence which he read, spoke as foUlows :-Ifear a veryerroneous impression prevails relative to the nature of -an inquiry like this, and mod'ern practice havig sanctioned the appearance of advocates the impression has thereby gained ground. It seems to be thought that this is a court where an accused person is on his'tria that acharge is made, andthat there must of necessity be a defence. Now, nothingis more incorrect or further from the real nature of a coroner's inquest. This is not a court of accusation, but on;e of inquiry. Our puncipal duty is to inquire into and ascertain the causeof death, and if, in the progress of the investigation, it shall appear that it has arisen from violence offered by another, then the law says you shall find, such a verdict as will send the party ciausing the death before another tribunal to answer the charge to he made againSt him. Your duty, therefore, in this case is to determine the cause of the death of Mfrs. Dove. If the circaumstances attending her death, and the results of the examination of her body after her death, satisfy you that she died from poison, it will be for you to say, upon- the evidence before you, .whether she took it herself to destroy life, or whether it was taken -or adrmnistered by accident or mistaLe, or whether it was administered to her designedly by some other person. Now, so far as the evidence goes, there seems tobe nothing from which you can, for a single moment, believe that Mrs.-Dove destroyed herself. It has, however, been suggested (by the evidence) that it might have been the result of accident-that some of the poison which was known to have been in the house rnight have been spilt and got among the food taken by the deceased. The suggestion was. made by Mr. Morley, as an inducement to the prisoner and his mother,to consent to an examination of the body; and we may fairly infer that Mr. Morley's suspicions were aroused soon after death, but that being unwilling, and properly so, to believe there had been aniy foul play, he ventured u,con this suggestion in order to arrive at a solution of the difficultywhic presenteditselftobis i'lnd-namely, thecause of death. Besides, it appears the poison was kept intheprisoner'srazor-case; thatiiponMrs.Wsthainexpressingsomealarn lest her little boy should get to it, the deceased assured her there was nocause foralarm-mueaning, no doubt, that it was carefully tak-encare of byMr. Dove. besides there is no suggestion that it was laid carelessly about inthelkitchen, where the food was prepared, or that it was laid exposed in the bedroom, so that I think you will be of opinion that the poison could not have been administered or taken by accident. or mistake. Then comes the third proposition 1 have submitted to you-namely, was the poison administered designedly by some other person, and if so, by w.hom? If the evidence irresistibly and conclusively point out the person, it will be your duty to find against that person A -verdict of wilful murder.- If you entertain any unreasonable doubt you will find -a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons ,unniiown. We will now further-consider the cause of death, and, in doing so, it will be advisable to turn at once to that part of M1r. Morley's evidence which describes the complaint under which Mrs. Dove was - labouring before Monday, the 25th day of Februa, last. 'The Coroner here read the evidence of Mr. Morley.] Up to 3fonday, the 26th of February, then, the complaint under which mrs. Dove laboured was functional disorder of the stomach and slight disorder of the nervous sybtem, and'there was no organic or serious disease; nothing from which fatal consequences could be expected. I need not referlaoreparticularly to aUjthe medicines prescribed -they were such as are usualy given. On Saturday, the 23d ofFebruary,thewitness, Am-i-Fisher (tlie imother ot Elizabeth Fisher, the servant 1iH vho had left on the pre vious Tuesday), arrived at ILtr.

From the evidence of - these three witnesses-Mrs -Witham, Mrs. - Fisher, and Mrs. Wood-we find that;there -were four know.n lic attaks. - The first which .Mrs.D ove had was on Moncai morning,.the 25th of pebxuary;soonafter brealfast; . the second -on Thursday night, at 7 'clock'; -the third on Fiday night, between 10 and U o'clock; and,the fourthndlast andmost violehat attack, was soon after S o'clock on Saturday night, the 1st of-March; and that she died at 2 nminutes ton1 o'clock the same night.

Upon the symptoms before death, upon the appearances on dissection, upon the anatysis,-andas to the cause of death the inecicalmenentirelysgree. AsI -observed to you atithe colmmencement of myremiarks, it is upon the evidence adducead before you that you are to form your opinion as to the cause and manner of death.- You are not to supply the -ant. of evidence by any hlypothesis of your own, and you amr not to set- -ap the,opinuins of other men of science against the- positive evidence of .Mr. Morley and Mr. INunneley. For the purposes of the present inquiwy, you are bound to receive and act updn.this testimony. It may be that other men of scieiceentertaisl differentopinLons. It may be that in other cases whiere strychnine has been -taken no trace -of it could be found afterl death. - In this case the medical- men have been -morefortunate, and they. tell us that the:tests they have applied satify them beyond any reasonable doubt of the presence fstrychnie. But, if anything was zwanting to conflan' opiions carefully, delberately, and imnpsrtialy formed by fnen of competentekii, and who hzv7eIhad previous experience in suchike cases, it is the further evidence they have giveh this morning. [le read this evidence;as given above.] Mis evidence is most valuable in determining the presence; of -strychnine in the body of the deceased after deatb. I do not think it necessary to read -or'refer you-to- the cross-exa*ination of the medical men upon the tests applied; because-their evidence is in no degrec altered by it;- nor could any- of us, either with satisfaction' br profit,- attempt to criticise or- controvert it. From the symptoms, then, before death' the appearances on the exiinination of the body after- death, and the analysis and its results, you will, I think,le constrained to say that the caus'e of death was strychnine! I alluded to the possibility of men of-scienocediffering upon the -results of analysis, and' wheje -they-do so, -havng 'had -eqtiilop ortunities of forming a correct judgment, sdrions dificulties will be- create& - -It -is, -however, sery satisfactory to find that, as regard poisoning by strichnine, there-ate some - mistakable and distinguishin-g features ulioii which all men of sciencearehgreed,-andthese arethe syniptocs duringlife. It may be difficult to say how little strye'niue will cause death, *hal ropportion will cause a qefiied amount of spasmodics ction, -and how vsoon:;after takiig it the spas- I modic action ill come on, and howlon-' it will contmue; but its' efects during life are ;we3. marked and settled. The -yrniptoms-coninence genera}ly froma 5 to 20 -minutes. after the strychnine bad h"en' swallowed. Thb patient is' suddeiily seized with tetanic symptoms, producing spasmodic contraction of the whole muscular system-the intell&ct -is-clear--the b6dy beoomes rigid, the limbs are stretched -out, and the jaws so 4-ed that considerable difficulty is experienced in introducing anything into the mouth-the muscles-of the chest are ffxedby spasmodic contraction-the -bodyg assumes the state of bein- bent backwards-thc lower extremities are extended ana stiff, and the soles -of the feet are concave-±-the skin becomes livid-the eyeballsprominent, and the jpupils dilated and insehsible. After several attacks, increasing in severity, death ensues from spasm of the n-iscles -of -the chest, produring suffocation.- -That these are the'symptoms duringlife produced-by stryhnine all men of science are agreed. Mrs. Fisher, and- Mrs. Woocal1,we shall-fLf,d lehie appearauces well marked and fully 'and clearly defined on the night of Mrs. Dove's death. Mrs. Witham said that, soon after ' taking the medicine, -Mrs. Dove complained of its being very hot, and a lozenge was given to her; and in about a quarter of an hour after her husband had given her the medicine, Mrs. Dove said she was going to have another attack, and immediately she was stretched out and her hands quite clenched. -She -threw her head back-'eie grasped the hands of those about her tightlyher eyes were staring and drawn aside-her breathing -was hard and difficult. A little before de'ath her face was discoloured. There was a heaving of the chest. This, no doubt, arose from the spasms rendering respiretion difficult. The spasms got more violent, and the one in which she died was the most violent of alL Mrs. Fisher said, she stretched her feet out, and her feet bent from her; they were slightly arched. Eer whole body 'was stiff, and her hands wrere grasped very tight. Her breathing w as violenlt (difficult, she meant), -and she could not :.allow anything. An attempt -was made to give ;her some wine or cocoa, hut she made xo effort to swallow it Mirs. Witam said that she swallowed it, but Mrs. Wood, who held the teaspoon, said she didnot swalow it-that it never got into her month, but ran dowrn her chin; and this was also Ms. Fisher's opinion. So that we must come to the conclusion that she was unable to swallow. Mrs. Fisher also said, here face was drawn and discoloured-her eyes were staring and fixed, and did not move-her eyes seemed full, and to start out a little. Mrs.Wood said, "Mrs. Dove graspedmy hand so tightly that I could not getit away. She stretched herself out, and threw herself back, and began to mutter loudl and with difficulty. ' Her body was arched as if sherested on her shoulders and her heels. She was stretched, and stiffasmuchas she could be. Her teeth were -clasped together. She could not swallow. I tried to open her mouth, but I could not." low, all these symptoms are precisely the sasbe as all men of science agree are p roduced from strychnine, and from no other cause. Without, - therefore, relying upon the results of the analysis as infallible proof of the presence of strychnine, have-we not much safer evidence of -its presence in the unrmistakable symptoms before death?9 It is manifest that Mrs. Dove was not labouring under any disease known to .her medical man which was likely to end fataly.. The examination of the body affords no clue to the death from any other cause 'than poison. And the symptoms immediately preceding death were sech as could not be produced from natural causes or from-natural disease. I think, therefore, that Iam not going too far when I say that, independent of the analysis, but without by any means discarding its results or doubting its correctness, or weakening its effect in the scale of evidence, you may safely come to the conclusion that stritchnine was the cause of death, from the symptoms during life. Mr. Morley says, all the symptoms during life, takenasaswhole,arereferrible onlyto strychnine. They are the -sual symptoms known - to be produced from strychnine. -None were Fanting. And he says he knows of no other, cause that will produce the same symptoms occuring inthe same mode and of the same violence. And Mr. Tunneley said the symptoms were' not referrible to any other cause than strychnine. There is no other Eubstance with which he is acquainted that will produce the same effects during life, the same reslts upon examination of the body, and anSwer to the same tests on analysis. You cannot, therefore, have any reasonable doubt as to the cause of death; and if you come to the conclusion that it was produced by strychmne designedlyadministered to the deceased, then you will have to determine -whether the evidence makes out satisfactorily to your minds the party who administered it. Now, the persons about Mrs. Dove during the week of her death, and at the-commencement of the Last fatal attaclk, were her husband, Mrs. Fisher, Mrs. Witham, and Mrs. Wood. Mrs. Fisher appears to have been an old neighbour of Mrs. Dove; MIrs. Wood had been long connected with Mrs. Dove's family; and Mrs. Witham was the friend and constant visitor of Mrs. Dove, and particularly at those times when her husband was absent. It cannot be suggested that any of these parties had any hand in the death; and I hope I am not pressing too hard upon the prisoner, William Dove, when I say that suspicion rests upon him - but suspicion is not guilt. It is admitted that he was in the possession of strychnine shortly before his wife's death, and he was near her and in a position to administer it to her at the time it was administered; but these facts 'alone will not be sufficient to justify you in coming to the conclusion that he did administer it, although they are most important features in the case. With suspicion -we naturally couple motive; but it is'not a part of your duty to consider or discover whether there be -any adequate motive to induce the comnmission of so foul a crime as that of maurder, because it is inpossible, amid the numberless motives which- act upon the minds of men, to say what would be a sufficient or probable inducement- In considering and deciding upon the band that administered the fatal ison, it is most important to consider when it was given, - because if that can be fixed upon with. anything like certainty it will not be difficult to determine who the paries were who were 'present when it was administered. We may, with' propriety, I think,; assume that if sufficient strchnine as given in one doe to-cae death, the effet will begin'to show the elves within half an hour. -Now,. up to the time -of- s Dove taking tea on the night of her death, she-had- no spasmodic attack. -Tbie tea ind the chop-and-the - teast -which sihe-took on that -oecsio~idnot isar&fithi~r;-an no oncse t - soDn after. It was nearly 6 O'clock when the tea was over. Nothing more was given to her, thatwe are aware of;uindiA her xmedcine at 8 o'clock. M.rs. Wit-ham, left the room about halfpa3t 6 o'clock, and retured about half-past 7, in about lIminutes Mrs. Wood came in, and that witness sad( M~r& Dove, -to all a~pperance, was then, very well, andI that she was sitting up inbed; -nd it is Perfectly clear that between hill-past 7 and 8 o'clock Mnr. Dove did not take anVth whatever. -This is clearly proved by the evidence 'Mta,- anid as regards the tune, frora 24zuinuteg to s up'-to 8o'clock" it is confirnedhby 3mr. W-ood. Then. at 8 o'clock Mr. ove gave his 3ife her medicine, and in aboat.a quarter -of aLn hour the fatal spasmodic attack began.-: xJpon these facts the- medical men be. -lieve that strycbnine.hid been put into the medicine ministered at 8 'clock; and, looking at all the circunstances of the case, this seemns the irresistible concluEion to anrive at. The prisoner, then, waLs-presetwhen thepoisonwvasgivenL. If it wrere put into the mbdicine, wvhat hand could have done it but that of Mr. Dove?9 The same medicine, out ofthe. same. bottle,had been given to Mrs. Dove by Mrs.. WVitaam - in the same afternoon, and that produced no bad effect. If Mfr. Dove had the strychnine about him, could it possibly have been accidentally spilt into the medicine? He poured out the smedieine and administred- it hi mself, and he washed out the glas. He had done so on former occxsions, however, and the circumstance of his doing so on the night she died ought not, I think, to be treated wit4. much imnortance. Mrs. Withan and Mr Wood- did not actually se Mr. Dove pour out the maedieine, but he did so, myond ali doubt, and hle stayed A sufficient, time at the washstand to enable him to. add the strychnine. StiU, no one saw him place strychnine in the. glass; and you aust judge, after earing all the evidence, whethgr he did so or not. It will be important to referto ;nd gravely cc.sider all that Mr. Dove did and said about the strychnine of -which he was so possessed. -The first time we hear of it is at the Union Cross Inn, in a conversation with Harrison, about two months ago. [He here' read Harrison's evidence.]- Mrs. Walker, t e landlady,- confirmasthis conversation; This is merely evidence of the fact of the prisoner's -deire to become possessed of strychnine, and proves notldig more. What he wanted it for:did not then Appear. We next find the prisoner at thxdsukgery 'of 'r. Morley, and it is very importaxit to see what took place upon, that and on a subsequent occasion. It-seems from -the evidence of the pupil Elletion, that,rabout a month before the day he was examined at this inquaet,- Dove- and .he ttked abo-at strychnmien,d,ttnponthLt occeion ho ,gave Dove about 10 grains. This would be about the 10th of lebruary, and it 1S rather a remLarkable coincidence that that was the first day the servant girl, Elizabeth Fisher, knew that poison wasin'thehosise- and onthe same dayMrs. Withanwas in Mis.- - Doves -bedroom in the afternoon after dinner when Dove caiie in- .and brought a small packet, and said he had brought some strychnine to poison some cats with. On that occasion Mrs. Witbam expressed a -hope that he would take care "where he put it in the yard, as she 'was afraid that her dog might get- to it. The avowed object of MSr. Dove in obtaining possession of strychnine was to Idl cats; and that he usedit for the purpose of killing a cat there-cank be no doubt. So far his- statement to Mr. 1Elletson vas perfectly true. But it would anpear that the -prisoner was interested aebout strychnine beyond the mere fact of kil&sg cats. 4 -After talldng to Elletson about Palmer's case,- he said he thought strychnine could not be detected after death. He - also- asked its effects on mian, and-he was told, spasms andacontraction of the muscles. Pereira's MateriaAfedicawas shown tohim, and he appeared to read the part under the head "Strychnine." After this conversation, he said he was-infeited with- cats, and that he thought of laying some poison for them, and asked X lletson to let him have some,: He gave him lOgrains in apaper, upon which he wrote the-word "'poison." On the same occasion the prisoner took a bottle fromn a shelf in the surgery whichI had antimony in it, and said something to the effect that that was thepoison Palmer used. Nothing further traspired between hiin and Elletson on that occasion. [He read Elizabeth Fisher's evidence.l Now, tics evidenem is quite consistent with the object for which Mr. Dove got the 10 grains of strychnine from Mr. Elletson. The gray-andwhlte cat was poisoned on the 15th of Febraary, five days after the strychniine was obtained; and we have no evidence of any further attempt to poison- the yellow cat or any other eat., It was after - the gray-and-white cat was killed that Dove obtained five grains more of strychnine. (He read -the evidence of Elletson, and continued :]-The evidence of Elletson is confirmed by the surgery-boy Peacock. -After the last five grains of strychnine were obtained there is no evidence to show what became of it, aud none of the witnesses appear to have seen it. In the absence -of any evidence one way or the other, it is by no means conclusive that part of it may not have been used by the prisoner -in attempting to kill the other eat. On-the other hand, seeing that the hole in the kitchen might have been blocked up so as to prevent eats getting into the house; and, seeingthat if they were troublesometheymight have been destroyed in numerots other waysthan by srycinine, it may be that the lllingof the cat in quesHion was a-mere excuse for obtaining possession of the poison. After obtaining strychnine the second time, which would be about the 17th or 18th of February,-asIhave before remarked, there isno evidence to show whatbecame of it. Some circumstances of a sls-picious character occurred on Saturday, the 23d of Febrawy,-relative to the bitter taste of some jelly which Mrs. Dove took 6n that day.. [He here&read the'evidence of Mrs. lFiher and -rs. Witham bearing upon this point.] I do not thinlk you can attach any imortance to this brauch of the evidence. The witne3s, Ilizabeth Fisher,- left Mr. Dove's house- and went home on the 19th of February. It appears from her evidence tlaat, -for some time before she left, Mr. and Mrs. Dove had lived -very unhappily together, and that Dove's conduct torwards his wife was on -some occasions of a brutal and disgusting character. I need nrt, - unless you -'wish it, read over this disagreeable part of the evidence, as it does not really affect, except in a remote degree, -the question you. have to determine. Besides, some of the threats- and epressions may have been used hastily and in passion, and 'when he was in liquor. There is one thing, however, in Elizabeth Fisher's evia direct contradiction to a subsequent statement made by Dove to Mr. Morlev. I allude to the expressed wish of -Mrs. Dove to bIe examined after death. On the night of his wife's death he went for 1Mr. Morley about 10 o'clock, and while they were waiting for Dr. Hobson a most remarkable conversation too place between them. [Having read this portion of Mr. Morley's evidence, the coroner continued :-This conversation took place -with Mr. Morley after the fatal dose had been given, and you can scarcely say that the reference to the expected death of his wife, and the great anxiety to avoid an examination of the body, emanated from- a mind wholly free from participation in some guilty act. If Elizabeth Fisher is to be believed, and there is nothing to impeach her general evidence, Mrs. Dove, fearing foul play, was most anxious that her body should be examined. You-will attach such inportance to this part of the evidence as it deserves. It seems that, sooriafter the doctor went away on the night of Mrs Dove's death, her hnsband left the house, and returned home at a late hour, much the worse for liquor, and was put to bed, drunk at 3 o'clock in the morning. On the other hand, we must not omit to notice that on the same night, and shortly before he gave her the medicine, he appeared affectionately disnosed towaras her. Yon will remember that the prisoner declined to accede to Mr. Morley's wish for a consultation with some other medical man, and you will also bear in mind his greatobjection to a post maorteu esxamination. On the 5th of Mfarch, the Wednesday after his wife's death, a farther conversation took place between him and Mr. Morley [which he read]. Now, -putting the most charitable construction upon the acts and language of the prisoner, it seems to me impossible to reconcile them-andparticularly his anxiety about knowing the result of the analysis-wvith entire innocence on his part. On Thursday, the 6th of March, the day after this intercourse with MIr. Morley, the prisoner again aiet Harrison, at the Union Cross, and on that ocmasion betrayed anxiety to know "whether strychnine could Ledetected after death." He said, "Can the detect a grain anda half of strychnine, or a grain's pcon which Iarrison said, "Have you given your wife any and he said, " No; but I got some of Mr. Morley's man to poison a cat with, and some might have been spilt, and the (meaning his wife) might have got some This is substantialy confirmed by the evidence of the witness Storey. - 1'art of what he said to Harrison wtas, no doubt, trute aboutt poisoning the cat; but, considering that the prisoner had s,trychnne in his possession-that he knew itseffects both on man and thelower animals- that he knew it was a deadly poison- he, of all others, mnst have known beyond a doubt (having the custody of it) whether any portion of it could by possibility have beenspilt, and spilt in such a way as to bacidentaUy mixed up with his wife's food or medicine. The suggestion of such a thing by the prisoner, inder the circumstances of this case, raises a strong-presumption of his guilt, but it is by no means conclusive evidence of it. I have now, gentlemen, veryimperfectly gone through all thematerial evidence broughtbefore us. If you are satisfied thatstrychnine was the cause of death, it will be your duty to say-that it was designedIy administered to her by some one, and, considering the fact of the prisoner being in possession of the poison, and the further fact that he nust have been present when the ison was gven, youv will have to determine whether, tunder al the circumstances of the case, you can have any reasonable doubtthathe admiistered it to hiswife on thenight of her death. If he did not administer it, can any other person be suggesteda If not, if all the world be excluded except [the prisoner, you must find a 'verdict of wilful murder against him. If, after the fullest deliberation, you see reason to doubt, then you must "ive the prisoner the benefit of the doubt, and find a verdict of wilul murder aainst some person or ersons unknown. The Coroner concluded his summing up at 5 minutes past 1 o'clock, and then added that if there was any point remrn eplanation, or an evidence which either ir. ar t or the jury thought he had improperly omitted, he should be glad to again refer to his notes. The jury and Mr. Barret intimated that there was not, and the jury retired to consider their verdict at 10 minutes ipast 1 o'clock. They returned into court at a-quarter to 2, when. The Foreman, in reply to the Coroner, said-"We find that Harriet Dove has died from the effects of strychnine, wlfully administered by her husband, William Dove." (sensation.) The Coroner.-Then, that is a verdict of wilful murder against WilliamDove, the prisoner. The Foreman.-Yes. The prisoner, who did not appear to be affected by the verdict, was then removed. The Coroner immediately afterwards made out his order for the committal of the prisoner to York Castle, to await his trial at the ne.xt assies, and he was removed there during the morning. _Advertisement.]}Extraordinary Disclosures of Russian Folicy in Reference to the Concdusion of Peace.
