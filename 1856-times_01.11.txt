The As.luma was erected for the accommodation of a matson. a Insater. one mdatress, too bons and 50 girls, The Socety ha sto far Iddto the nmany prereing claim as to inces th ubr fci rtt 3,and the number of masters and mistresseu roportionatelyr. Whi'-lst. tioenrthe fundsof the Soietybhaveenable the Committee s0 largely to extend the blessings of its institution, they have entirely Called to supplY the necessari meanis for the due enlargment of its EAm3lum; andi the building, Originally intended to receivea only 11D chil L-en has been mande to contain 2118. Hence the school rooms, dining looms, and variolus Offices had become quite inadequate, the bed rooms cad become over-crowded, and no accommodation for the additioWa aaters and mistresses was afforded. It seas therefore necesuary either greatly to reduce the numnbcrof Cbildretn tthe Asylum, or to enlarg and imnproye the building. The Committee decided on the latter course fealing sur that the triendisof this Qiarity woold liberall contribute to liqnldate the debt go incurred, rather than add to the numbler of those heartrending gases which even now of neessity appeal in vain fornts beniefits, The cost of the buildings recenitly erected (intended to supply Cermntoeie-, lavatorsrs store rooms,. _e.), exceeds X4,ffO. towards Which object only --],tOO of the presen tfunds of the Society are avail. zbie. The enlargement of the school rooms, &o., has no.t yet, been Commrencal. The Committee, therefore. earnestly solicit the liberal -ad of all who ,njoy the blessings which thin Society seeks to bestow upon those WOm misfortune or orphanhood has deprived of them. Of those now in theAsyltum nmanyare thechitldr;n of parets once In affluent independence-of officer-s in thle toyal Navy, of ofEcers in the armyr, of clergymen, phycinans, surgeons, end solicitors Others Iare the chifldren or once pross,erota merchants, farmers, and tradesmen.

MONBY-APAREBTand CITYINTBILLIGENCEB. _ This has been settling day_intlie ngilfds,1 and-the fluctuations, which- have been considerable, have resulted in establinhin. a recovery-from the;fal of yesterday. Cousos for money leit off laWt evening at 86k to i, and were first quoted this morning 86} In the arrangement of the account it became manifest that the market was over supplied with stock, and a renewed decline took place to 851; a tone of extreme dulneus being generally observable. Towards the latter part of the daythere was a better feeling, and, the disposition being in favour of a rise, a-few influential purchased caused an improvement -to 864.. From this there was only a temporary and slight reaction, and the final prices were 86 to i for money, and 861 to J for the 7th of February. The heaviness which prevailed in the morning was in'creaged by anxiety with respect to the probability of a further advance in the Bank rate of discount, and the breaking up of the . Court without anything having been done contributed to the ultimate restoration of confidence. The question as to the progress of the peace negotiations remained without any additional light, but there was less tendency to -assume their certain failure. Bank Stock closed at 206 to 207; Reduced, 86 to 4; New Three per Cents., 87; Long A-n muties, 8 ; Annuities, 1885, 164; India Stock, 217 to 220; Exchequer-bonds, 97 to 4; and India Bonds andExchequer-blfls, 8s. to 3s. discoumt. The rate for money in the Stock-Exchange to day onshortloans was 5 percent., but in thearrangement of the account there was at one time some pressure, and in occasional instances dealers were obliged to pay as much as 7 per cent. to carry on their operations til February. The general charge, however, up to that period was at the rate of 5a percent. In foreign securities there has been increased activity. The market opened with heaviness, and prices temporarily showed a further tendency to deeline. Subsequently the favourable reaction in Consols brought forward buyers, and then a general recovery took place. The difference between the highest and lowest quotations ranged frointo -i per cent. In Turkish Six per Cents. the transactions for the account were at 864, i,&, i, and i. Bargains in the Guaranteed Four per Cent. Scrip occurred at 4g and 4 for money, and 48 and 4 for the account. The final quotation was 4i to 4 discount. The other overations comprised-Brazilian Five per Cents., 98i and 991; the Small, 984; Buenos Ayres, for account, 523 ; Chilian Three per Cents., 64; Mexican, for account, 19*; Peruvian Four-and-a-Half per Cents., 75; Portuguese Five per Cents., 50; the Four per Cents., 45J; Saudi=an Five per Cents., 81, 814, and 82; Spanish Three per Cents., 39 for money, and '38, i, -4, i, and i for account; the New Deferred, for account, 21M,si, and 4; Passive 6Q; Venezuela, 2O4; Dutch wo-and-a-Half per &nts., 634 and i; and the Four per Cent. Certificates, 944 and a The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 62f. 75c. for money, and 62f. 90e. for the end of the month, showing no alteration in the g,eneral state of business beyond a slight increase of money purchases and a decrease in those for the account. The Paris letters describe continued firmness in the rate of exchange consequent upon the demand for bills on London to pay for the recent large purchase of Mexican silver for the Bank of France. The transactions on the Bourse are limited, owing t3 the principal bank-ing firms being unilling tooperate during the present state of suspense, and the speculators, therefore, it is said, have command of the market. Letters from Riga to-day reach to the 3d inst., and describe a continuance of the Baltic navigation in consequence of the unusual state of the weather. Altogether seven vessels had arrived at that port laden with salt, and several more were expected. The temperature, however, had just become colder, and there were now five degrees of frost. A special meeting of the General Screw Steam Company took place to-day, at which a resolution was passed authorzing the directors to apply for a supplemental or additional charter to confirn the payment of 21. per share made to the proprietors, andto convert the shares of the companyinto shares of 181. each. It was also agreed to allow the introduction of a clause authorizing the reduction of the shares from time to time by repayments, if the same be necessary, provided the operation shall not bring them below St. each. The discussion generally related tothefuture prospects of theundertaking, but, as it was a special meeting, no information could be afforded. Inquiries made respecting the opening of negotiations with the Government for the recharterMg of steamers were consequently not replied to. The advices from Canada brought by the New -York steamer yesterday furnish another illustration of the reckless course of trading which was pursued by many houses in that colony until the facilities for credit were arrested by the war. Messrs. Cuvillier and Co., of Montreal, who suspended some months back for 116,9181., have issued a circular stating that the first estimate of their assets was much too favourable, and that they now do not show a dividend of 3s. in the pound. They add that, with the assistance of friends, they are able to make an offer of 3s. in three half-yearly instalments of Is. each. A dispute is pending at Liverpool of some importance to the shipping interest. The lawful exercise of the powers of Receivers of the Droits of the Admiralty has on many occasions been doubted, and a question has arisen with that functionary at Liverpool under the following circumstances, the point to be solved being the perplexing one of what is a wreck within the meaning of the 17th and 18th of Victoria inthe Merchant M[arie Act:-A vessel named the Pied-ner was dropping her anchor, to wait the tide for docking, when the chain parted. Boatmen from shore were working at the tume on board, and the master contracted with them to lift and restore the chain and anchor for lGI. Upon their being raised and brought alongside the Receiver of Droits prohibited their delivery except upon an order s.gned by him, and a deposit of 161. with ll. 1Os. fees. The deposit and fees were paid, and the chain and cable restored, but no order, it is said, 'was ever signed by the Receiver. The ownership was never disputed, and thequestionscontestedare,- was this a wreck, and was the Receiver entitled to any fees? Mr. MFCulloch says a wreck is usually understood to mean any ship or goods driven ashore or found floating at sea in an unmanageable condition; but that, according to the legal sense of the word in England, it is assumed a "wreck" must have come to land, since when at sea it is distinguished by the barbarous appellations of flotsam, jetsam, and lagan. In the present case it is insisted none of these terms are applicable, as the cable parted in the river, and not at sea or in a roadstead, and may be said never for a moment to have been out of cognizance. The Board of Trade have considered the matter of sufficient consequence Jo send down an officer to inquire specially into the circumstances, and the decision is looked for with interest both by merchants and underwriters. Many complaints are made of the Marine Act in consequence of the vexatious exactions for which it is used a%a pretext. The Government, however, are adated to have shown everdisosiiontoivestgat anreiedythese evils. At a meeting just held of the committee of the silk trade at the London Silk Conditioning-house, it was stated that the accounts to the close of the year showed the quantity conditioned to have amounted to 1,656 bales, weighing 327,6281b., being an increase of more that 90 per cent. on the total of 1854. The larger propoortion WaS for exportation, the value of the practice being fully appreciated by foreign buyers. The amount conditioned in Lyons during the past year-was the largest ever known, being 392219 baes, weighing 6,7L2,1131b. At St. Etienne it was 8,577 bales, weighing 1,563,485alb. Among the several banking frni; who have presentedto their lerksl,000.for distibution since the ommencement of the new year are-Messrs. Heywood and Co., London ; Messrs. Heywood and Co., Manchester; Messrs. Prescott and Co., Messrs. Hankey and-Co.,.and thle London and Westminster Bank. In addition to these gifts, it is understood advanced salaries lave in some cases been granted. - Another new edition of 'CuUodi's Comniercial DitiounliJ has jiit been isnued,j although the previous ono -was published less than .tiio years back.* It was rendered necessay by the extent and importance of the reforms in our system, which, notwith- standingathe war, have been effected in the intervaL Thus, the present edition contains under the proper heads all the provisions of the Mrcantile 3aine At, IJie new Passenger Acts both of Great Britain and the IJnited States, and the Limited Liability Act.

AILWAY IrNTELLIGENCE. I SHREWSBURY. HANWOOD. AIM WVTS1TmnT. A large and influential meeting of the inhabitants of Shrewsbury was held there on Monday to take into consideration the best means of promoting the construction of a railway from Shrewsbury, vid Hanwood, to Welshpool with a branch to Minsterley. Mr. J. Hazledine, the mayor, presided. Mr. B. PIERcy explainel that the scheme now proposed would accomplish everytbing that could be desired. It would not only supply the requisite accommodation to the Rea Valley anid to Central Wales, but it included Welshpool and the various districts converging thereon. The proposed line would start from the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway at Coleham, and terminate by a junction with the Oswestry and Newtown Railway near Weishpool, vwith a branch from Crack Meole by Pontesford, up the Bea Valley to Minsterley. The total cost ofjithe line-21 miles in length-would be 150,0001.;* the workss would be light and the traffic large. The line was much wanted An the district. InWelhpool 15,0001. had been raised by small subscriptions, and in MWontgomesy and Newtown about 20,0001. had been subscribed, lIfthe people of Shrewobury were to subscribe in the same pro,POrtion a. large sum might be raised to carey out the underStaking. After some observations from Mr. Ho vxr Mr. fuiCEr,. Resolutions were passed in favour ofthe proposed railway, and a vote of thanks to the chairman concluded the proceedings.

STATE OP TBADE. MANCRESTER, J". 10. A moderate business only was done in the cloth-market. this morning, and buyers appeared disipsed to operate quite as cautionaly ason Tuesday. Yet a quiet demand frorthnet to time, and sometimes on other than market days, dears of what accumulations of stock may have begun to take place, and prices are mostly steady. Yesterday it is understOO& that a considerable quantity of cloth was purchaed for export. The low stocks with which we have commenced thea year give sellers a great advantage. "The past year will bat a remarlable one in the history of the cotton trade (remark: Messrs. John Ponder and Co. in their Overland Circular vid Marseilles, published yesterday), as, notwithstanding th;r war in which we are engaged, the consequent dear and stringent state of the money-m3rketj the high urice of grain andL aimost every article of produce (a combination rarelycontinuinglog), stocks of cottongoodhave been keptdo This has been cansed by the deterdmation of producers not. to accumulate, and the consequenceahas been to thems amost unremunerative trade. They may possiblysoon derive some~ benefit from the losses thus sustained, as the low psicesn which have been carrent have no doubt forced goods into new channels, and developed a trade that is likely to goe increasing." fn sbirtings the demand of the vlst month has beengoodforthebetter 9uaities of 40-inch,ande f4fanc f 54-inch loths, all of winch are realizing full prices.

ACAAULAY'S HISTORY OF EBNGLAND. TD= 1roTIC:. rConcluded from Dlie Timea of Tuesday, Dec. 18, 18X.) In mny a household, since we greeted the reeppearance of Mr. Macaulay, the holyday horns have 7een absorbed by his narrative. The most readaNe of our grave writers has been 'so eagerly read that ,we may now venture to state - our own conclusions on his performance, for we assume that we can do soby thistime with unimpeachable fainess. We do not then partake the opinion which some have expressed, that the present volumes are inferior to their predecessors. They have the same b3eauties if they have the same defects. Had any one else described the same epoch, could he have made it as pleasant as a novel and as exciting as a drama,I Who of us all could marshal the same extent of information, the same minute, varied, and abundant details in the same perspicuous order to the attainment of one object?- The transparency of 3Sr. Macaulay's exposition may leave the reader little stimulus in the way of suggestiveness. His laboriousartsof luminous expansion may defeat his previously avowed intention. The multitude of his details may obscure his perspective, and his diffuseiness may seem to render parts of his work independent which are really inter-connected and closely sequential. But with every abatement, what choice qualifications have converged to the production of xsuch an imposing piece of workloiapship. What 3mnowledge, what ap5,,ib, what experience in his art, what industry, combined with brilliancy, 'and 'what clear common sense dispensed in a fine state of t~hetorical' effervescence. That we were already familiar writh these qualities is no reason for our slighting their present repetition. They delighted as heretofore, and once they were net. They are siew no longer, but the most ungracious or fickle aof critics viill not venture to maintainl that they are in the least degree impaired. If Mr. Macaulay is not only what he was in his strength, he is quite as conspiculously consistent in 7 zis weakness.- This time he has been more cautious, <and yet not sufEiciently so. HIe has apparently citedb bisa authorities, and so far enabled the otherwvise ur.- proteeted reader to test his assertions. Bu' there is rio denying that his faults are still considerable, and -that as proofs accumulate the public begin to per.ceive them. It strikes us that they are capable of a 2simple explanation, and that we shall best exhibit them by following them to their sources. The first imupulse to go astray is generally of a very early ~growth, and the impulse in this instance was manifested long ago, though it was w ithout the pale of parental correction, being simply a precocious avowal of a, perverse theory of history.. It will be seen that this theory wvas M.r. Mlacaulay's -entry into temptation, though it is remarkable that hie seems te be utterly unconscious of its tendency. In the midst of his memorable description of the Thghlanders, he admonishes, for example, writers of the school of Scott. These, he suggests, as contrsed with the Ossianic impostors, moulded their fabrications on a more truthful basis. They saw "show strikingt an effect might be produced by 'ekilful pictures of the old Highland life. W.hatever -,vas repulsive was softened down; whatever was graceful and noble wvas brought prominently forward. Some of these wrorks were executed vwith such admirable skill that, like the historical plays of 'Shakapeare, they superseded history." It may be 'easy by such means to supersede history, but there 'will be little occasion for the inventive substitution if we adhere to the theory of blr. bIacaulay. Our readers should w.atech closely the ideal we are about to cite, and observe w.hether in any material respect it difl'era from the meteier of Sir Walter and hisa imitators. Mr. Macaulay was required in early life to review no less an historian than MIachiavelli. En that occasion he laid dowFn a principle wvhich he lass since adhered to, to the exctent of republishing it without comment or qualification. LXet our aseaders mark it carefully, and especially the expressions we have printed in italics, and w.hich we sahall have frequent occasion to quote. "¢The classical histories may almnost be called romances founded in fact. The relation is, no doubt, in all its prin-cpal points strictly true. But the numerous little inqcidenta which heighten the interest, the words, the ;gestures, the looks, are evidently fornished by the imnagization of the author. The fashion of later times is different. A more exact rmrative is given by the 'writer. It may be doubted whether more esact notions are conveyed to the 'reader. The best portrsits are perhaps those in 'which there 1s a aUgtSA cdrnzixiure of caricatulre; and wre are not certain that the best histories are not those in wrhich a hiUt'e of the arcggcrotion of fictitious3 arrative is judiciously employed. Sosaething is lost in acculracy, but much is gained in effect. S~he fainter lines are neglected, but the great characterislic fieaturer are imprinted on the maind for ever." Mr. 31acaulay may or mnay not have abandoned tshius theory, but we have ample demonstration that he has persisted in the corresponding practice. Hlis "characteristic feature" on this. occasion is 'the progress of the Revolution, and he is rigoht in the scope of his narrative. In his. principal aim we all coincide. The 3Revolution was necessaqr. If it was. necessary, it was equally neces-sary that the Revolution should be strenuously maintained. The Stuarts, it is. perfectly clear, 'were intructable. They were pedantic or unreliable, 'dissolute or refractory. The r esumi of their four recignsr was an olio repulsive to the English -atomach4'aud clearly repuguant to English common sense. A deliverance was indispensable, and William asDeliverer was. inevitably accepted. Having :grasped the crown, it was in the interest of the Engo,lsh people that he should firmly retain it. He saved them from the proscriptions and the yen- ace of an ousted dynasty. Hfe stood in the -breach with a Thutch valour and a Dutch tenacity. He was equal to the wvhole emergency. He had -not the personal qualities, which could render him popular with Englishmen. But he was the only 'candidate who could disentangle a precedent of revolution from a precedent of restoration, and he 'was therefore declared King; and with the wise concurrence of the nation was retained in that gbtth ood fortue which befell himn mig'ht 'equally have befallen Monmouth, had the latter potponed for a few years his rnl-fated enterprise. William, by judicious management, stepped into a vacant place-into a plaoe whEich the Lords and Commons of England, in their extreme perplexity, 'were compelled to declare "vacant." He stepped 'there, and he filled it fairly. B3ut it is one thing to zecognize him as a necessity of the hour, and another 'to worship him with unpatriotic incense. A!S the saver of England and chastiser of France he is 'worthy of honour, but not at the expense of every E3nglitfi or other reputation which appears in any way to compete with his. Set him on a pedestal, but in proportion to surrounding objects. Paint him, obut not with paint of such a hue that it -darkens everybody else and outglares truth and pro-. -priety. Mr. !vlacaullay has preferred to work out his .ihoyon behalf of his "characteristic feature"-the PRevolution. With this object he has delineated Wil1iam, to sy the least, wvith " a little of the exzaggeration of fictitious narrative," and he has presented as .a foil as great a man, Mlarlborough, wvith not merely ";a sight admixture of caricature." We observe, first, the exaggeration of William's merits assisted 'by a careful reduction of his principal failings. Of alil the politicians of that fickle age no one was more 'clearly tainted with duplicity. He promised to be *James's son-in-law to the last breath of his life with -zeal and fidelity, and we 'wll assume that he fulfilled -that obligation. We 'illnot renew the question Mfr. MIacaulay dismisses so lightly as to his secret furtherance of the enterprise of Monmouth. But -we cannot forget the series of his deceptions on the 'subject of the infant Prince of Wales. At the first maewr of his birth he sent Zulestein to congratulate his father-in-law, and the Prince was3prayed for baynameat theHague. lThen when the bassinoire5tory gained 'currency the prayers were discontinued?. Again they were resumed when it was apprehended that a rupture with England might thus be precipitated. In the Fagel-Burnet Declaration the calumny; was touched up anewa. Thedeclariti6n promised, for William, "to cause inquiry to be made by Pat1iament into the birth of a supposed Prince of Wales." andto acquiesce in its decision-; ahd if that.inquiry W terwards refused, who can doubt, even with Burnets explantions in the foreground, that it was suppressed, notin the interest of James, but inthat of Willism ? The whole course of this intrigue is discreditable to the Orange interest, and to William limself, but it is kept in the bakground, almost iji,isiy, by Mr. Macaulay. Again, William took- God to witnesa he went to Eugland with no other intentions than those he had set out in his declaration; on which tide Swifts CommnentarynponBarnet. He protestedtothe Courts of Europe, and epeciall -to e Emperor, that he Ijadno design on the trone of England; on'the sincerity of wrhich protest take again tho verdict of $wsift5 or rather of Common eacne, It wrou.14 be superfluous to iark such examples of personal honour yielding to public necessities if they were fairly admitted, if they were not sedulously secreted in the ease of William, while they are strenuously pressed against all his adversaries. Include thenmthis is all we care to advance-in the elements for forming an estimate of William's character, and don't strike a too favourable balance by simply excluding them. Still less set all probabilities at defiance to exculpate William of muich greater criminality. The suggestion that he signed a warrant without reading it for the extirpation of a wh'ole clan of Highladers is transuarent in BDurnet, but it is not tolerable in Ifr. 3Iacaulay, even in his capacity of a " sl7ght" exaggerator. The "ofictitiols narrative" here has not the charmof novelty- - The table spread with tex and toast, a 'Death warrants, and the Momina Post," is an old picture, and will not bear. repetition. *We have already shown in what respects it does not taly with the inference inevitable from the ensuing circumstances of the transaction.. MIr. Mac3ulay has accounted for Williamn's unpopularity with Englishmen by the coldness and inflexibility of his deportment. *But how tenderly he has toned down the coarser traits of William's naturalbooriliness and occasionalbrutality. Burnet, whose descriptions are understood to have been modified, admits that he spoke with "a disgusting dryness;" he "hated talking and house ames;" and he was ol that Later timea may addto the signi;ficance of Burnetfs concise epithet, "slIow. But he was worse than slow, and worse in a sense which is inconsistent with slowvness if in many instances he evinced a brutiil disrega3rd of the feelings of those about him. That he horsewhipped an EnElishman for riding before him on the race-ground-that he wore his hat in English churches-that he ate up the whole of the first dish of peas of the season, under the eyes of a longing, princess in a delicate condition, without offering her a spoonful-are inconclusive traits. But what shall we say to Dartnouth's description of his malicious enjoyment of the annoyance he caused to his companions, or of his unfeeling conduct to his submissive wife? That he treated her harshly for her adhesion to the church of England, and that he outraged her natural regard for the memory of her grandfather in the roughest fashion, are proofs of a perverse nature which are not to be mistaken for phlegm or indifference. Yet to this harmless level Mr. Macaulay has subdued the most direct proofs of William's unamiability. Even at this level William is treated with a pictorial licence which is not always consistent nor invariably correct. " He never once," says Mr. Macaulay, in one of his present volumes, " during his whole reign, showed himself at the theatre." In his previous descriptionhe hadembellishedacontraryrepresentation as follows :-" Dramatic performances tired him; and he was glad to turn away from the stage and to talk about public afiairs while Orestes was ravin', or while Tartuffe was pressing Elmira's hand." W'e observe the loophole by which the former picture may be reconciled with the present assertion, but a further ingredient in the same idealized portrait is obtained by a forgetfulness of the most notorious facts.. Mr. Macaulay is justifying William's neglect of the English poets by the reflection that " those who are acquainted with the panegyrical odes of that age will, perhaps, be of opinion that he did not lose much by his ignorance." The point is not very material, but it is worth mentioning, for those who are acquainted with the panegyrical odes of all ages would find a difficulty in mating them with a cou2le of Dryden's, published, one three or four yearsearlier and one a few years later than the date inMr Macaulay's margin. To either of those odes-one to the memory of Mistress Anne Killegrew, and the other not exactly a panegyrical ode, except that it was in honour of St. Cecilia's Day-we will venture to say there is no parallel in the English language throughout the whole interval from Lycidas to "In. AIenmriam.'" Are we mentioning these circumstances with any desire to disparage the character of william? unquestionably not. We entertain too profound a respect for "the immortal memory of his great services to exaggerate his faults on the one hand, or on the other to attempt to soften them 'without occasion. MIr. Macaulay, it appears, is otherwise inclined. He dr'aws his characters in the spirit of a tastefuLI artist. As MIendelssohn composed songs without words, Mr. Macaulay composes a picture without pigments. As he sketches it on the canvas, and the features glare out grimly, he subdues their effect by the most delicate of backgrounds. The gay gardens, the extended avenues, the painted villas, the canals, andeven the storks of theUnited Provircesare broughtiritotakeofftheasperityofWilliam'sfeatures. He is surrounded with objects in which he took little interest, and invested with domestic virtues which hesparingly exhibited. He is painted, not in the style of Rembrandt or Van Der HeIst, but in the brighter hues of Wouvermans or Mieris; and the effect is somewhat analogous to his treatment by an inferior artist, Schalken, who insisted on painting His Majesty as seen by candlelight, and posed him with a candle in his hand till the tallow ran over his fingers. Some such uncovenanted effect, we say, is produced by Mr. Macaulay's interference with the natural light-~anid shade of William's lineaments. The sterner features of the hero are diffused awaydrowned in what Commodore Trunuion calls" unnecessarygum." Thesombretenacity, sograndlydogged, is smothered in the flower-beds and summer-houses of Loo. We miss the gloomy patriot on the brink of a last reverse, yet threatening that, if all failed, he would take his country on board- his ships, and find for it a new capital in the savage islands of the East. William was too great a man to require such tender handling, stil less exhibition at the cost of as great a man-Marlborough. Williamliberally rewardedhis coumtrymen with English gold, but it is too much that he should thrive upon English reputations. That Willam might appeara model, Marlborough is made. a monster-to use Mr. Macaulay's phrase, " a prodigy of turpitude." We resist this upon valid grounds, and, in the meantime, mark his ownresemblance to an historical character of Marlboroug,h's age,- "So over violent or over civil, "That every man with him is God or deviL" Yet it is clear, on Mr. Macaulay's showing, that Marlborough was not by any means as black as he is painted, and it is equally clear that among the men of his time he was not in any sense " a prodigy of turpitude." Marlborough rose from obscurity to great eminence, and from extreme need to abundant wealLh. His love of money was confirmed into a vice by the double pressure of poverty and affluence. But his love of lucre was not his mater passion, norhislove of power his only principle. -His love 'of Sarah " prevailed over his avarice," and MIr. Macaulay is certainly aware that he wrould not sacrifice his religious convictions to his advancement. With these facts admitted with a grave ast6nishment, what does Mr. Macaulay's first inculpation amount to f " Marlborough," he says, "'was one of the few who have, in the bloom- sf youth, loved lucre more than wine or 7comen." HEe preferred, that is, of three customary vices the most common and the least geniaL Hedidnotlovelucremore than he loved his wife. He did notlove lucre more than he loved his creed. He exhibited in his youth a vice of age, whereas other men in their age more frequently exhibit, though with less prudence, the vices of youth. But Marlborough was not of. the common mould, and prudence was his vice or his virtue according to his circumstances. It is mentioned by Warton that a certain peraon tunamed thought to please Lord Bolingbroke by ridiculing the avarice of Marlborough, but he was stopped by Bolingbroke, who said, "He was so very great a man that I forgot he had that vice." Mr. | 31acaulay does not forget' it; he remembeir it before al else. He recalls even the rumours, true or false, of the manner in which it is said to have been manifested. If they had all of them been reliable, if Marlborough made mnoneyo'ut of his public table and ,out of.the pay of his.troops,,wss he wo*se on-Mr. Macaulay's showing than all who were at that day conected with the administration of the a'rmy? " The :courtiers," he says, "took bnrbes from the colonels; the colonels cheated the soldiers; the comrmissares sent in long bills for what'had never been furnished; the keepers of the arsenaIs sold the public stores and pocketed the price." Would some participatron in -a system' so universal, if it was clearly brought homie to Marlborough's charge, dishnguish him as "a meie Euclio," or- "a'mere Harpagon," and mark him as a prodigy of basenessonly o be paralleled in fiction7 -But then he secretly corresponded wvith St.' -Germhs!-.and so did his colleagues, with avery few ixceptins. Eetalked of brigover the army to James; but "the hlypoes-t., when. the time camue, " evaded the demand7" WMs he worse in hi respect, was he more of a hypocrite than RUs1, who Wide -similar overtures, and in like maDner evaded them? Will MIr. Macaulay remember he wasahypocrite when the presumption would tell in' Marlborough's favour? If, indeedi he sent information 'of the design against Brest with a view to defeat it, and it was defeated by -his ageney, then is Mr. Macaulay entitled -to enjoy the full licence of hisown language andto callhim "amurderer." But the circumstances of this trannsction have been discussed minutely eisewhere,* and they do not appear to- warrant either imputation. Marlborough -may not have intended to defeat--Marlborough may not have been the means of defeating-the Brest expedition, ind yet he-may have tiied to convey that inpression to James. ME. Macaulay lays incessant stresson-" the credulityof exiles" whenhewishes to exculpate more favoured double dealers Marlborough had mostreasontopractise onthatcredulity, for if James was restored without his being securely, pardoned MDarlborough would have been the frstto appear upon the scold. - And here to all the time;servers of jthe Revolution in common with Marlborough let us do simple justice. They were not examples of political virtue, but they lived in an age when party was infinn, when its ases were shifting, and wheni it was almost impossible to be at the same time virtuous and safe. In the whole range of English history no men wero more sorely tem.pted. They were-sincere in-their desire to' sustain the Revolution, but 'thebalance was trembling between revolution and reaction-between the life of a childless, asthmatic Sovereign and the imminent prospeet of a renewed successon. To usit isthe turning point of two centuries of ourhistory; tothe actors it was barely a prevision for the morrow. Wiliam might die, James might return, or the son of Jamues be preferred to his daughter Anne. Uncertiaint,y kept the politicians of the age in a state of chromse terror. They felt the edge of the axe continuallyat their throats, or timagined the gripe of the hangman on their shoulders. M>r. Mlacaulay makes sport of themoody Jacobites when William obtained a success in the field. But the Shrewsburys and Godolphins were equally to be pitied. That success might be the last, and then what wasto beome of them? In the contemplation of their future they felt a stimulus, and found an excuse for aets of political perfidy. At that time, moreover, the Revolution was not the " chara-derisic feadtre" which (to return to his theory of history) it now appears to Mr. Macaulay. Its spectators had not the advantage which we possess of seeing it through the medium of " exaggeration" and "caricature." In the absence of the latter element many, perhaps a majority, were not disposed to regard the King at St. Gernains as a fatuous, inhuman, unbearable monster. All thought him possible, and many thought him preferable to the king whom they actually had on the thzrone. But "caricature' has shown his pretensions so clearly that we can condemn at our ease all his enemies who were not consistent,, all who wavered from foolish scruples or mistaken affection, all who doubted or desponded of the CWA- seqltences of his deposition. i As tothe Kng himself, at this day we give him up,! in virtue of our better knowledge, as an impossible! Sovereign. But we may remnark, in doing so, the; " caricature" which assists us. AM1 James's. better. qualities are kept out of sight, though these we shall not dwell on, not being in his interest. We shall not either notice the imputation that he abetted the assassination of Wiliami, though it rests on the single testimony of the would-be assassin. There are, if we had time to cite them, some remarkable proofs that James was incapable of descending to that degree of baseness, but we pass these over. We take only those specimens of caricature which are discernible on the very surface of the volumes before us. There is no instance in which MIr. Macaulay has used his pictorial talents with greater effect than in marking what he considers the inclination of James to cruelty. He treats it as an exceptional trait; he dwells on his callousness as compared with the men of his time-on his enjoyment-even of inflictions which they would have shrunk from. - "Lauderdale," he- says in his first volume, speaking of the Duke of York in Scotland, "was now outdone." The Scottish Privy Council had power to put State prisoners to the question. " But the sight was so dreadful that, as soon as the boots appeared, even the most servile and hardhearted courtiers hastened out of the chamber." It was requisite to order that men should keep their seats. But the Duke of York "seemed to take a pleasure in the spectacle." He "watched the agonies of the sufferers with that sort of interest and complacency with which men observe a curious experiment in science." He " amused hirself with hearing Covenanters shriek and seeing them writhe while their knees were beaten flat in the boots." This is caricature after the manner of Gilmy or the F'rench Diablerists, without the advantage of personalobservation. Mr. aEcaulay had never seen James at his diversions, playing the part of an imaginary fiend of the pit, and he had no warrant for describing his presence at such scenes as extraordinary or, according to the prevailingnotions, improper; still less had he reason for representing it as diabolical. The fact is that torture was at that time re,garded in Scotland as a common process in criminal cases, and Mr. Macaulay only records his " astonishment" and not his error when he finds this was the case even in the reign of William. In 1689 the ScottishEstates, left to themselves, declare, to his admitted surprise, "by the plainest implication 'torture' to be according to law." They even direct the magistrates of Edinburgh to strike the murderer of Lockhart in the boots, and name 4" a committee to superintend the operation." Nothing astonishes an BEnglishman " more than this," especially an Englishman who has made a point of exonerating "the mostservile and hardhearted courtiers" of complicity in the process, and of fixin it upon James after the fashion of his imnaginative eloquence. A certain Payne, a Jacobite traitor of 1690, excites no repugnance in "the most servile and hardhearted courtiers." When this person was brought before the Privy Council " thepies Crawford," who pre*sided, "was not much troubled with the weakness of compassion where an Anialekite was concerned, and forced- the executioner to hammer in wedge after wedge between the knees of the I prisoner, till the pain was as great as the human trame can sustain without dissolution." -So- obviously were the boots by no means an unpopular instrument, or an exclusive source of amusement to James. - Scotland, as described by Mr. Macaulay, is, indeed, a region of fable; a land of uncleanly vices and unwelcome valour. - It is also a region in which he has the nidest latitude for his opposing traits of "caricature" and "exaggeration." Dundee, of whom we know so little that is accurate or reliable, evinces an " excess of wickedness-" On o the other hand, the MIaster of Stair, on whom Mr. Macaulay casts the chief responsibility of the most atrocious act ever perpetratedin a Christian country, is simplyan instance of " ill-regulated public spirit." The " first murderer" in the tragedy of Glencoe was " a very good-natured man." He "seems to have proposedto himself a truly great and good end-the I pacification and civilization of the Hightvnds." His I "disgust and indignation" at Highland disorders were "naturally excited," and Mr. Macaulay sus- tains him with all the horrible precedents of his ex- I tensive reading as one who contemplated "a great act of justice-nay of charity." What is this but to lend the aid of tender "1 exaggeration" to a fanaticism onlyworthy of Sf. Just and his accomplices? Mr. Macaulay's narrative happily redeems the inap propriateness of his epithets. He marks the malig- nant joy of the geat delinquent when he learnt that,Jin.consequenco.of an informality, Me Ianhad nbtnsbnmitted within-the appointed time, and the news that -was, " soe - comfore" to his implacble spirit.; He allows that "by a dark intrigue," probably directed by the samne: delinquent, the eidence of -Mac a's . submission waa supprssed. He quotes the letter charging the.suders to " let it be secret and sudden," and "!not -to trouble the Government with zrisoners;" and-he describesi in language which will live for ver, the hoipitable -reception, and the treacherous reprisals; with the shrieks of the midnight massacre, awakening -the echoes of the lonelyglen. Yet for all this the Master of Stair is " an enlid htened and politic gownsma," and his dastardly cr,mc is a proof of " ll-regulated public spirit." It is a kindred exaggeration to'asseii roundlythat had the Episcopal Church of Scotland been upheld "New Lanaex would still have been a sheepwalkand Greenock i fishing hamlet." - The -exaggeration isdivided with discriminative tact in the terms appliei to the further apprehended. comequenoer. " ffiucces. sive Mitchells woucld"imply t havefirca at uccea :1 IRYe8harpes-,"but" five generaons of Cigaer- houses would have bucNarec firvs generationx of Camerons." Claierh6use, in the hour of his triuin- phant agony, is not disriiissed with a single tolerant' epithet. Mr. Macaulay is irflexibly coo at the morment when" Glad Dundeein faint huzzas expired." The chivalrous soldier is simply " the dying man". and " the body,'"whileM$ickay, defeated and ranning away with his troops, who are elsewhere described as runnung "like hares," is "-sustained by a firm faith in-God and a high sense of daty to the State." He " stil held his head nobly erect," and M. acaulay, unwilling to lose the favourable attitude, leaves " the body" in its plaid and runs after, him to take his portrait. When we return to England the exaggeration and the caricature are more subdued, but they are not less discernible. There is a slight tendency to the former in the description of the reversal of the attainder of Lord William RusseLl. The " spotless integrity," or, as Macintosh had calledit before, the "unspotted virtue" of that unhappy nobleman was at'all events sullied by a rancorous patronage of the Popish plot; said when re find him compred to "the upright and benevolent AIthorpe" as being "I as honest and kind-hearted a gentlemnan as any in England" we ask what is the meaning of a sentence in Mr. Macaulay's first volume:-" Whigs were disposed to murmur because Stafford wis suf- 2 fered to die without seeing his bowels burnt before his face ?" Was or was not Lord William ituasell the chief protester in that vindictive remonstrance e and if, as Echard declares, he was, 'and as Lord-! John his biographer allovs it probable he may have: been, is it not again a specimen of exaggeration to, Mal him " as kind-hearted a gentleman as any in England T' It is rarely that the exaggerative or caricaturing propensity betrays Mr. Macaulay into an actual misstatement of fact ; but, if we wished to bring himto historical grief, the chosen lure would be the name of Jeifreys. The brutal, roaring, bloated judge is represented in his dungeon with remorseless force, and is soaked in the wretchedness which was properly his due. Mr. Mfacaulay, however, not conteht with his sufferings, reverts to the time when he rode the Bloody Assize. He conjurs up the butcheries of the 'wicked judge upon the partisan of Momnouth. and, comparing his rapid elevation with his terrible fall, obtains a further artistic contrast from the circumestances of his burial. " The emaciated corpse," he says, "was laid with all privacy next to the corpse of Monmouth in the Tower." Jefireys was buried at St. Mary's, Aldermanbury, as may be seen in Mr. Peter Cuningham's Hawdbook; of Iondon. As Mr. Macaulay has remarked elsewhere, his " insolence and cruelty excite, even at the distance of so many years, an indignation which makes it difficult to be just to him." But we may, nevertheless, let him rest undisturbed in his grave, and not disinter him for a coup de thedtre. It is amusing to find the ladies of the Revolution, according as they are connected with William or with James, coming in for the same discriminative treatment. The personal appearance of MIary is the theme of excessive praise, especially as we have been. reminded of "thcoarsc featuresof Anne Hyde." James, we were told, "was not nice." He was " drawn away from his plain consort by a plainer klistrm,"n meaning thereby Arabella Churchill. The plaier mistress had, nevertheless, according to Grammont-whose opinion on such a point we should prefer to Mr. Macaulay's-certain qualifications of "exquisite beauty." Catherine Sedley, her successor, is ruthlessly described as " lean, haggard, ugly, plastered, and painted ;" but Catherine Sedley had a mordant wvit. On the other hand, Elizabeth Villiers, the lady who nominally held the same position by the side of William, is said by Swift, who admiredher talents, tohave "squinted like a dragon." BIr. ]acaulay had noticedthevisualobliquity before, and now he prefers to paint her in profile. His courtesy to the ugly concubine is worthy of Versailles. " 7ltis lady had, when a girl, inspired William with a passion which had caused much scandal and much unhappiness in the little Court of the Hague. HEer influence over him she owed not to her personal charms," &c., but to her powers of mind, and so she contrived to iival the attractions of Mary. William, though described as a devoted husband, " still, in diflicult conjunctures, fre- quently applied to Elizaisbeth Villiers for advice and! assistance." He also was " not nice," and Mary is i better treated by her historian than she was by her consort. the little indications of her internal deficiency- remarked by the Duchess of MIarlborough have been loyally disrevarded. We conclude, then, thiat Mr. MIacaulay has freely employed the license he allows the historian wvho has conceived a " characteristic feature ;" and so far we have not raised any cogent objection to its exercise. But the question remains, is this the right mode of writing history? We will not affect in a paragraph to extemporize an answer which really requires a volume, but we can freely say this,-it is a dangerous privilege in any hands; it is dangerous in proportion as the writer is a man of genius, and it is incalculablydangerous when, as now, the writer. is a consistent partsan, and when every step in his narrative implicates in some way his party sympa- thies, sentiments, or convictions. Mr. Grote would! not allow such a privilege to Thucydides. We hy u should we render it to Mr. i Macaulay w t Per- i culosiz pleutm opus alee," especially as it involves the "ignes supposiaos." Of those heatsMr. Macaulay has been all his life a zealous partaker, and he now volunteers to record their orign He is pantig from the fray, and he asks to decide the issue with sumniary powers of incalculable latitude. We must peremptorily decline to grant them in this instance. or wemustancel them, ifassumed, when there is a: tendency to abuse them. We may cite an examnple of this tendency in a purely Whig sense in MIr. MIacaulay's treatment! of the lonjurors, an obstructive class whom we are happily rid of, but whose scruples and whose sacrifices deserved a better mention. Mr. MIacaulay loses no opportunity of disparaging their principles, their practices, and theirtalents. ! He cites a conversational dictum of Dr. John- Eons that in their whole body "there was one I (meaning Lenlie), and one otly, who could reason; " but he withholds the context, that "he was ac i reasoner who could not be reasoned ag,ainst." He forgets that Johnson, in a more deliberate shape, his Life of (YonreZre, says that Collier also " was formed for a controvertist," and indicates with what effect he employed his qualifications. He himself has given Law the redit of dialectical sklel. Batm Sherlock,-Een, Hiclies, EettleweDl and the rest, are briesy allowed to swell the tale, while Mr. acaulay. cites thetestimony of Jonlison, though at variancevi with his own Judgment, to throw dust in the eyes of the jury. -.t - It is, however, twhen we ome to the great names of our. literature that' Mr. Mlacaulay's lang,uage isE most imbued with all the keen resentinent of the.! partisan.--* From, the English to -the Erench -RevoIn.- tion there were four Eng,lish men of letters so pre-j eminent that it is superfluous to name themn. All four were antagonistic to Mr. Iacaulay's views and stand in the way of his summary conclusions. Of that stately quatrain Swift and Dryden are the only two he has encountered as yet, and what is the 1 temper in which he hasgreeted them ? Alas for the ' Republicof Letters-forthetrustinessofitssyssiUia.

Mr. Bel, in 'his 'Iife of lbMnm prefixed to his penis, cites a wranamt dated 168 'for apayent of a portion of thiirefsibur which had fallen due in 1680. Itr.

Thepaymeta, may have falen into arrears, and thec have, ben in`abeyanee but it was recognizedi by letters pstent -of James, dated -the 4th of Mfarli, 1685-6. Solittleground,therefore, hadMr.wcaulay for insinnating doubts of Dryden's sincerity, and so clearly did he owe him;a more charitable contruction for the future. - -evertheleas he has not thought fit to albtin fromsimlar insinuations, -and on-an occasion which less warranted them. 'In 1690, in the apprehenmion of a descent bvthe French, politicians of both sides sunk their differences, and Dryden amongthemparti- ipated in the patriotic -feeling. " There was one case" said he, addire6sing Hlalifax, " in whiclh the PRoman veteran, - even after his discharge, wras re'quired to resumnehis shield and his pihim; and that one case was an invasion ' of the G s At this natural andnoble language Mr. Xacaulay insinutes a douabt whether it was used " sincerely or inincerely," and, with especial reference to'Dryden, he sendsthis petty shaft in the direction of tuo arrow which had previously missed him. ' "So strong," says Mr. Iacaulay, "was the national entiment thatNonjurors andPapists shared, or affecto to shar it," and-he -goes onto speak of a writer "who hadf jn&rdzised the smiles' (whyno ongerthe pension,)f James by his servile apostacy. Mr. Muacalay should remember that Dryden in his lifetime gave some painful and costy proofs of his sincerity. Perhaps he does remember that in anage of dedications, and when dedications paid handsomely; there was one wvhich Dryden- sturdily declined-thtat proposed to him by Tonson for his translation of Virgil, and in whichall the pictures of aoneas had beendstudiously altered and furnished accordingly with the hooknose of William. Another topic occasions some amusement to Mr. Mhaulay-the distress entailed -on Dryden by the loss of his pension and taureateship. That the Governmenthrwhich went out of its way to pensiorn Oa.es, if he was" abhorred and despised by etery respectable WlVhig," should think it necessary to dismis Dryden, is reasonable enough; but if, in his distress, lhe gave vent to his feelings, we are told that he complaned- of losses "which he had not suffered," because "the magnificent q hamberlain gave him a pension equal to the salary which had been withdrawn." Did the magniaicent Chamberlain liquidate the whole deficiency 9 We arhe i]ined tosay "tNo ;" because Prior's dedication to Dorset's son and successor, on which alone Mr. Miacaulay reles, says, guhy Lord allowed him an equivalent out of his own estate" for "fc King's hewas"ic." iere is nothing about the 100!. a-year he received as lanreate, or the other 1001. a-year hi e received as istoriographer ; and the deprivation of these, which cast him back upon his literary labours, may well have evoked some eypressions of bitterness. But what ground has Mr. Mraca-ulay to describe him as being " as poor in spirit" as he was "rich in intelBeagifts9s" "Why does he aver that "lie comthathe,piompusla One "aifectino remonstrance"the expression is Sir Walter Scott's-we knowhe did utter on a different occasion. "Some small employment," lie said, "would render my condition easy. ....' 'Tis enough for one age to have neglected Mr. Cowley and starved Mr. Butler." And we know, also, that he died, as Mr. Bell says, "so poor that the expenses of bis funeral were undertaken by subscription." But that lie complained piteouly, in a mIean sense, -eunder any circumstances, we doubt lf he did so complain, he had plentiful occasion; anld Mr. Macaulay was the last person who should have expressed what he terms a "merited contempt" for the misfortunes of a man of letters. But Dryden, in Mr. Macaulay's phrase, was "an apostate," a guiltZy apostate; whereas, if he had been a Whig, he wFoud simnply haive " taken refuge in the bosom of a church which pretends to infallibility." Swift again "ratted." If a less eminent Tory had turned%Whig,he wouldhave "modifiedhis views," or "transferred his-party attachments." The animus of Mr. Macaulay diffuses itself even into his mos3t cursory epithets. Pens. was "wandering and lurking," and Bishop Turner " slvulling' where a WhigV would siraplyhave "~remained in concealment." Dundee " scrambled" down the Castle-hill, w.here a Whig would, perhaps, have descended more majestically; and soon. If apersonsimilarly gifted wfere called upon to describe this tendency,he would parhlaps say something which would resemble this:"Int the days of wihich the historian is witing there were two descriptions of men, of unlikce motives and passions. The one wasto be found principally in the camp of the Whigs, the other was to be found principally in the camp of the Tories. Occasionally the occapants of the Whig camp acted the part of Tories, wAhilo the occupants of the Tory camp acted the part of Whigs. But that which in a Tory was ' excess of wickedness,' was simply in a Whig 'ill-regulated conduct ;' and that wluch in a Whig was ' ill-reaulated conduct,' amounted in a Tory to 'excess of wickedness.' So inconsistent is hun nature, and so discerning was its eloquent historian." We have so far insisted upon one fault, and one only, but that the parent of faults innumerable. The tendency to " caricature" and " exaggerate" on behalf of a "characteristic feature" is seen in action; s6 also is its progeny. We have so far observed their family likeness, and we wMil not pursue their genealogy further. But there is yet an error so extraordinary that, without. undertaking to mark its parentage, we will simply note it and then conclude. Again, under the head of "xfunerals neatlyperformed,"we have the following obsequiestotheDukeofSchomiberg. "Tohis corpse," says Mr. Macaulay, ore rotutndissinwo," every honour teas paid. Tlhe only cemetery in which so illustrious a warrior, slain in arms for the liberties and religion of England, could properly be laid, was that venerable Abbey halloweed by the dust of many generations of princes, heroes, and poets. It was announced that the brave veteran should have a public funeral at Washrinster. In the meantimeu his orpsewas ernbalmedwith such skill as couldbe found inthe camp, and wras deposited in a leaden coffin" At this announcement we dry our eyos, hang up our liatbands, and gro about oulr ordinary business, consoled to reflect that the Revolution was so far 31ot forgetful of " the +irst captain in Europe." The " newr and peifect Journal" is quoted for this inform.nation; and therefore it is wth considerable surprse. that we read this eiahi > ars Dablin:epitaph-in St. Patrick' Eic infrasitum est corpus TFederlcil )lds de Sc0oml,er- Ad Budindam occisL A.D. 1&0.

To such an extent is this carried that in America.table,cutlery maybe purchased at lSs. per gross.

What is the quality of.the mnaterialwhat the claracter of the workmanship! NXo . wonder. th3 knives "won't iut." Theblades cannot he.grpund to cut at the price paid for them; and the material is not of;a quality to "'hold an edge." The wiole character. of.. such. goods is a "mockery, a delusion, and asnare." Indeed. there is nothing honest about them, but thet disreputable name-" shams ;" a name given in derision, adopted for its brevity and expressiveness, and retaineduntiLits odiousness is lost in its fahmilarity. The above illustrates one branch of manufacture. The second cause of cheapness of production is the facilit_ for manufacturing in the Sheffield trades.without capital.

LONYDON, FBrDAY, JEIAYuARY 11, 186. - ---- 6 We have at last received the exact text of the conditions of peace tendered by the allied Powers to Russia. The definite answer cannot, we are informed, be received before the 15th of this present month. Are these terms destined to form a memorable epoch in the history of Europe,an civilization, or are they destined to be consigned to the limbo of abortive projects wvith the treaty of 'Uxbridge or- the armistice of Chatillon? Is the present war destined hereto Come to an end, while it yet retains somewhat of the dispassionate and almost judicial calmness and reIuctance with which it was commenced; or is it to take henceforth a new beginning, with the avoweed object no longer of merely protecting the Ottoman rdominions from the immediate attac;s of Russia, but of -depriving her of the power of repeating a sinilar. outrage? That will depend on the result of the conflict between, the war and peace parties in the Cabinet of the CzAR-on the natural struggle between the wish to relieve an exhausted people, a ruined trade, and a bonikrnpt exchequer, and the stuibborn determination to carry out the plan of universal monarchy, and rather to 'rid; the subversion of the whpole framework of ocicty thin to recede from a single pretension or fosegoDee drm' f co4ueftt oryXortion that-PszTz, CATHE1U?,E, AnnLFXAID, or NICHOLAs may have entertained, Regarded fromn ourlpoint of view, the-terms =. -afinciently reaa6nable and moderate, and| 6duched in langiiage -sdi6ouuslr nieAired, go a to give the least poBiAe odence -to tle susceptibility of our antagonists. When we consider the objects for which we most unwillingly took up anw, we can hardly imagine that Russia herself can expect that-we should be content with a less extensive basis of negotiation; unless, indeed, the fortune of war had declared decidedly against us. .'It, is difficult to put ourrelves in the position of our enemies, and cIearlyto represent to our minds with what feelings a patriotic Russian must regard such an offer, though even he, we should suppose, must feel that in the demand of such terms there is nothing either arrogant or presumptuous. . No one can suppose, we should think, that after what has occurred the allied Sovereigns could leave th3 Danubian Prineipalities in their present disjointed and disorganized condition. They must be governed, and governed by a Power in no respeet subject to Russian influence, if they are not to become again in a few years once more the Begium of the East of Europe, the battle-field on which the advanice of 'Russia is to be checked, as that of Louts xIV. was on the plains of Flanders. Neither can it be expected that the allies should leave it in the power of Russia again to place a ligature- on the main artery of* Germany by blocking up the Sulina mouth of the Danube, and thus cutting off the principal line of commlnication between the East and the West. Nor is it conceivable how thin is to happen without requiring the surrender of those fortresses and that territory which gave Russia the command of the river from the embouchure of the Pruth co the sea. The complete neutralimztion of the Black Sea would also seem the easiest and least offensive mode of putting an end to Russian domination in those aters. Limitation carries with it the notion of the continua: pressure of a superior force, and counterpoise is but a thin veil thrown over a continued state of hostility; but the mutual agreement to emancipate the Blaek Sea for ever from the presence of hostile fleets, to forbear from the crection of fortifications, and to admit the Consuls of the allied Powers into Russian ports is, we slhould imagine, les offensive and lems galling to the pride of our enemy than any other manner in which the inevitable curtailment of her aggressive powers can be effected. While the matter is yetuncertain we challenge the advocates of Russia or of peace to show that we ask anything to which we are not well entitled, or abuse the powers which a series of brilliant successes has I placed in our hands. The very moderation of these terms makes them the fairest test of the real dispositions of Russia. If she be content to live, as other Powers live, in peace and goodwill with all mankind, improving her vast territory, and seeking in the pursuita of peace and commerce I an' indemnification 'for a century and a half of endless war and conflict, she wil accept the opportunity to escape from a struggle from which the calm judgment of her statesmen and warriors must assure her she has nothing to expect of glory or success, while, if she still cherishes the wild dreams of her traditionary ambition, she will yet tempt once more the fortune of arms. We could not desire matters to be brought to a fairer issue. Peace must not be made while Russia possesses both the will and the power to injure us. We are content to make peace if she possess the power without the will, or else forced to continue the war until she no longer possesses the' power. We are unwilling at such a moment to assume a vaunting or a threatening tone in speaking of what we have achieved ana what may be looked for In the ifxt campaign. We hardly venture to expect that Russia will give her unqualified acquiescence to the terms proposed, but anticipate a counter-proposition- dexterously framed, so as, if possible, to disunite the allies, fling Austria back into her former inaction, and introduce discord into the counsels of France and England. We have said that the terms are moderate, and in no respect to go beyondthat which, in the most modest view of our own position, we have a right to demand. Should, then, the answer of Russia amount to a direct repudiation of any substantial part of the tenns offered by the allies, the course of honour and interest is clear. They are bound to proceed vigorously with the war, and to try what effect another years operations may have in changing the counsels of the enemy. Should, on the other hand, the answer amount substantially to "Yes," we are convinced that no idle punctilio, no adhesion to a formal and verbal consistency, will stand in the way of muLtual agreement. The settlement, if settlement there is to be, must be prompt alnd definite. We cannot afford- to repeat in this year the diplomatic, any more than the military and naval mistaes, of the last, and do not intend to be tricked in council out of terms which we believe ourselves able to win in the field. For the event, notwithstanding Mfr. COB]MT, we have no fear. We may not indeed be able to penetrate to Moscow, or even to St. Petersburg. We may not feel ourselves in a position to plunge armies into the vast wilderness, like CHARLES. XIL or NA&oLzos, but the process of exhaustion is surey and steadily going on. Men, money, commerce, means of transport, arms, ammunition, manufactures, and agriculture are being gradually exhausted-an exhaustion which can hardly be pressed beyond a certain point without bursting the bonds of military subectiQn whiVh hold the mighty mass of Russianl domination together. If the fear of the sword be once removed the manumission of the serfs must follow, and, with it, the destruction of the territorial arktocracy, and a disintegration and disruption of the mighty mass which the sword alone has held together. If Russia has yet a destiny, if she is to be a principal agent in the annals of the times that are yet to come, she will seize the present moment of making peace ; if she be destined to expiate her ambition and aggression by premature revolution and decay, she will doggedly adhere to the course to which she is at present cmmitted.
"'Here}y is the differing from me. ' Im"'morality' is the disoledience of my pre"cepts. ' Sacred,' ' venerable' are terms "that apply to all that I uphold; the oppo"sition to them is scandalous and deplorable." Such is the language of priestly authority in all ages and churches. But the Apostolic Roman See has its own peculiar diction. A rescript, allocution, or circular usually commences with a proposition which is either a truism or an unobjectionable platitude. Having taken this for granted, the writer proceeds to unfold his suibject with endless repetition and verbosity. M1uch mawldsh sentiment pervades the, .diff se and tamid document, and only 'towards its close is the real gist of the matter approached. With many assumptions of benevolence and care for the ffithful, the affectionate pastor announces a decision which he knows will move the anger or disgust of every high-minded man who reads it. He mildly uggests obedience, and hints at the penalties which will fall on evasion. With a general bleming or the repetition of some moral text he concludes his lengthy uke. The Archbishop of lIxw has entered on the eereise of the powers conferred by the da. he newspwper pre wag the 0rst oXbject of his spiritual. censure. This penig of the campaign is'd aito have bo-n . far, fiom r successful, for - the . Government showed no alacrity for prosecutions at such a moment. .While the fate of Europe was in question the Cabinet of Vienna . had no desire to give to the world the spectacle of. domestic discontent repressed by new and obnoxious tribunals. The Lombard prelates, headed by their Metropolitan, have therefore resolved to put forth their full powers. The Archbishop of MIft-, has addressed a circular letter to all printers, bookellers, and vendors of engravings rosident in his diocess. He is, to a certain extent, " master " of the aituation.' He. confines himself stricty to the terms of the Concordat, but all the power that it gives. him he declares his resolve to exercise. ln that astounding, treity, which bas just spread dismay through the Austrian empire, and has raised the wonder of Europe, two passages occur. The 9th article says, that " The "Archbishops, Bishops, and all local priests are to "exercise freely their own authority to condemn "with censure books detrimental to religion and "to good morals, and to keep the- faithful. from "reading the same." It is afterwards added, "The Government' also will provide every neces"saxy remedy to prevent the diffiusion of such "books in the empire." These sentences- will fully explain to our readers the scope' of the Achbishop's circular, and the support which he fancies he can command to enforce his orders. The ink of the Concordat is scarcely dry, it has been signed after months of debate, it has been proclaimed as the comnmencement of a. new era, both by the Church and State. The suppregsion of obnoxious writings was practically its most important article-that for Which the clergy had longest clamoured, and which had -been most angrily oppo,ed. The decision was final, and must naiurally be acted upon. If it be not enforced there is an end of the Concordat, for the PoPr may well suspect that a treaty broken on a chief point within two months of its promulgation will hardly remain Imperial law for many years to come. The EMPERon may repent, his Cabinet may be timid, but they must acquiesce and assist. We cannot, therefore, wonder that Monsignor CARLo should take courage. He has law on his side, and the words which hr 7 ^ lean, be explained away. Relying, then, on the civil arm, he announces to the printing and publishing world the terms on which they shall for the future pursue their calling. " As it is," says he, " of "the last importance to our Catholic faith and "-to good morals that no errors of any description "whatever should be propagated in whatsoever "manner by means of Wooks or periodicals," he states his resolve to suppres 4 any transgres" sion of the sacred regulations of the Index "as regards prints and the publishing trade." These, then, are his orders,-that it be incunbent on all publshers or editors, as sons of the Church, to submit to eelesiastical revision all writings or books, of whatsoever kind, which they may intend to print or reprint. If by the disobedience of this command any objectionable book be published it will be at once suppressed, and the publisher must bear the loss, in addition to civil penalties and spiritual anathemas. All booksellers must furthermore obtain permission to sell any work coming from abroad. After these injunctions it is perhaps an anti-climax to entreat the trade affectionately not to damn their souls and those of their brethren by disobedkneo to tha regNIaton. "I >1I9 t4q eet " hope of our words being hearkened to," concludes the Archbishop, "we give our pastoral "blessing to all the above indieated." For any man who observes what is passing in Europe and sees how, in spite of many obstacles, the nations are emerging to a higher and happier state, it is undignified to utter lamentations on the events we have related. The old comparison of an advancing tide holds good with respect to continental progress. A treaty between bigotry and despotism is the momentary recession of the advancing flood. The very fact tltat there should be books to cenue, booksellers to warn, and a people to intiraidate, shows that Italians of the present day do not sleep content with the usages"of their forefathers, the dogmas of their priests, and the institutions by which they are ruled. Where there exists a national feeling, a desire for a better and more intellectual culture, there is no reason to fear that a race can be kept in ignorance by the censorship of a narrow-minded clergy. With the usual craft of his profession, the Bishop in his denunciations mixes up scandalous and immoral prints with works dangerous to the Catholic dogma. But this artifice can impose on no one, though it may, perhaps, give the Government a loophole of escape. A razzia on a few shop windows may be an excuse to the Milanese Government for abstaining from a proscription of the standard European classics. Whatever may be the immrediate results, however, we feel sure that this impudent attempt at mental tyranny will come to nothing. The clergy are going too far even for Austria. Whatever the Government of Lombardy may be, it is impossible that it can enforce the degradation of its people to the level of Naples or Rtome. The prohibition of nearly every English author, of all living Frenchmen, with the exception of romance- writers, dramatists, and the editors. of the Univers-of three-fourths of the -orks issuing fron the German press-c*nnot; be maintained, except among people who _havefr6i mtheii birth known nothing better than the lowest intellectual culture. But not only fom -the native energies of the human mind and the progress - of Europe is there reason to look for the failure of this censorship. . We believe that the - Austrian Goverment will have no wish to assist the priesthood in its renewed efforts for supremacy. The terms of the Concordat are, no doubt, explicit, but it was probably expected by Austrian statesmen that these powers were to lie in abeyance until necessity called for their use. The Austrian Sovereign has long aimed at the centralization of his States, the fusion of Hungary and the Slavic races into something like one nationality. He is known to have held, rightly or wrongly, that ecelesiastical power would greatly aid his efforts. A strict union with the Church of Rome and a theoretical theocracy which should apply to his whole dominions were the basis of his system. Since this Concordat was resolved upon men of more liberal views have entered offiee. Still further have great events wrought a change in the views of Monarchs and their Ministers. The alliane with France and England, to which Austria-ii slowly tending, must modify the old dreary type of despotism. If the Imperial Cabinet -has for its own views established the Papacy in neiv privileges, we believe that it is far from any statesman,s thoughts that these, newly acquired powers should be abused - in such a manner' as to expose the EsrERop and his Govermment to the reproaches of the w'orld.
There are two old friends to whom schoolboys are generaUly introduced in their first year of Greek, and whose fame depends upon two remarkable experiments which they made in reference to the laws of mortality. One attempted to ascertain upon how little his horse could live, and just when he had succeeded in reducing its con- tmuption to one straw a-day had the mortification to find the poor animal, through ome unexplained acci4ent, dead i the. stall. The other, haling heard that crows live a hundred and more years, purchased a jouug one, in order to see whether it was the case. 1rhaps the old Greeks who luclhed at such experiments would be as much surplised. at the extraordinary results which we obtain from our tables of mortality as we are amused with the stories which ridicule vain attempts at a science of this kind. Take one simpleT fact-the diminution of mortality in this. great 'metropolisand see how much it involves. At present about one in forty of the inhabitants of London dies annually. Two centuries ago about double that number, or nearly one in twenty, died annually. What an immense increase of numberless, nameless, little material blessings, called comforts-an idea for which no foreign nation has as yet-discovered a title,-is implied in such a diminished rate of mortality I It iiuplies a wonderful subjugation of disease. We have maladies 'enough. among us not to boast too much of the progress of medical skill, and it would even seem as if the annihilation of one disease were the signal for the outbreak of another just as baid; but the virulence and the ubiquity of disease among our ancestors were something fearful, and the remedies of the physicians were still worse. Whoever is even slightly acquainted with the dramatic literature of the seventeenth century, and from that we get the clearest insight into the life of the period, must have been amazed at the familiarity which the poets display with disease in its most hideous forms, and how they extract a terrible poetical interest from ailments which, if we were now familiarly acquainted with them, would only awak-en the extreme of disgust and horror. idke the Greeks, who, in the most celebrated of all thoir tragic themes,-the frightful story of Thebes,-find a strange pleasure in the horrible details of the plague, our English dramatists dwell with a gloomy fascination on the long catalogue of those iUs' which flesh is heir to; their allusions to sickness and pain are even more freq-sent than to daily food; their characters have an especial meaning in wishing " stitches, aches, " catarrhs, and rheums" to seize upon their enemies; the most severe of imprecations was to wish one of the common loathsome diseases upon the accursed; and, over and above the peculiar exigencies of tragedy, which it is necessary.to bear in mind as in part accounting for the fact, there is a mournful familiarity with imAgeg e- 9.7Y and death, of sick beds and graveyards, a tendency to unfold a tale or unravel a plot by a mysterious pining, a galloping consumption, or a speedy death, which has an air of improbability now. If the diseases were bad, the doctors srere worse. If a disease was then the damnation to which a man consigned his foe, the doctor might have been imprecated as a more potent personage is now. The patient was bled till he swooned, roasted with hot irons till he awoke to misery, dosed with hideous compoinds extracted from cofns till he got worse, then starved till he found a little relief in sleep, once more blistered into convulsions, finally beaten, shaved, skinned, slashed, gashed, boiled, peppered, and stuffed with nauseous herbs, like a foredoomed mummy, till he died. Apart from the superior knowledge of modern physicians, the fact that they have learnt to leave their patients alone has done more, perhaps, than anything else in physic to alleviate suffering and lengthen life. And, while the medical faculty may fairly claim no small portion of the praise which is involved in the decreased rate of mortality, the advancing wealth and wellbeing of the communitymustprincipallyaccount for thisimprovemeni. Oui people ate better fed} better elothed, better housed; otur cities are better drained; our iarshlands have almost ceased to exist. Travelling, too, is infinitely safer than it used to be inthe days when it took months to cross the Atlantic, weeks to travel from Edinburgh to London, and the seas were infested with corsairs, the roads with highwaymen, the ports and the inns in continual terror of contagion. It is impossible to enumerate all the little contrivances that have helped to bring about the increased longevity-such, for example, as the umbrella, which was so much ridiculed on its first introduction, and is now such a universal friend. It is true that we are not all right, and that we run our own peculiar risks. Of the adulterations of food we are not now going to speak. There is one thing, at least, which we ought to get pure, and that is water. From the mortality returns of 1849 and 1854 it appeared that a great excess in the deaths from cholera oceurred wherever the districts were s upplied with unwholesome water. Since then an act was passed through Parliament to enable, and if need be compel, the water companies to supply London with pure water, somewhat different fiom that which the Thames usually affords; and the people of London wil be gratified to learn from the report of theREoisRA-GEuniL, which appeared in our impression of yesterday, that they are either now or are about to be supplied with a much purer water than that of the cholera years. TheSouthwark,theWestAMiddlesex, and the Grand Junction Companies now obtain their water from parts of the Thames far beyond the range of the tide and the reach of the sewers, and supply the west and south districts and MIarylebone with it. The East London Company, in like manner, has gone further up the Lea, and takes the water from near Chingford, in Essex. Chelsea, Westminster, and Belgravia, however, are. still compelled to' drink the 'slow poison of TFather Thaines ; but the RE=TeRsR-dM sE s XCports thatthe' first of the'se'.districts is ere long to be supplied with a more innocent liquid, from which we may conclude that the two latter are still to be condemned to their present highly seasoned beverage. The wonder is that, under such penalties, water should be drunk at aiL When the water has a bad taste and a noxious influence, is there any room for surprise that the lower classes take to guzzling beer and gin-preferring of two adulterations that which is more pleasant to the taste ? As a general rule, the richer classes have become remarkably temperate in the use of stimulating liquors. They do not drink much, and they drink light wines, and many would abstain even from these, if it were possible to get drinkable water. It is greatly to .the credit of the water companies that they have achieved so much. Let them go on in their good work, it will be for their own benefit, and, when the effect of this improvement in the health of London is investigated, we join in the confident expectation of the REGWnUR-GNMUAL, that " the results " wilibe as gatifying as the results of former in" quiries were painful."

FOREIaN INTELMGENCE. AUSTRIA. kFROM Oo0 OWN CORRPONiDENT.) [Aportion of the following appeared in our second edition Of yesterdaV :-I VENA, JA?r. 6. In order that your readers may be able to form a correct idea of the change which the successful campaign of 1855 has produced in the policy of Austria, the language which the Imperial Cabinet used last spring will be contrasted with that which it now employs. On the 20th of May, 1855, Count Buol addressed to the Earl of Clarendon a despatch containing two propositions, which wvill be given it enteisso, as they clearly show that fully seven months ago,-wvhen Aulstria believed thatc Sebast9pol was impregnable,-she was wiling to demaand far more from Russia than is nowv offered by Count Nesselrode in his circular of the 22d of last month: . nsr Prorosmos. "Art 1. The higgh contracting parties, being desirous that the Sublime Porte should participate in the advantages of the good understanding -established by the law of nations among the various Statesof Eiurope, severally engago to respect the independence and territorial integrity of the Ottoman epiire, garuantee in co;nmon the strict obserrance of this engagement, aud will, inconsequence, consider every act and every event of a nature to endanger it as a question of European interest. If a difference should arise between the Porte and one of the contracting Powers, those two States, before resorting to arms, should place the other Powers in a position to obviate this contingency by pacific means. " Art. 2. The Russian Plenipotentiaries and those of the Sublime Porte will propose in common to the Conference the equal effective force of the naval arTmaments which the two sea-bordering Powers will maintain in the Black Sea, and which must not exceed the amount of Russian vessels at present afloat in that sea. "The arrangement which they shall have made in this respeet shall form an integral part of the general treaty. "There shall also be inserted in the treaty the measures which the said Plenipotentiaries shall have agreed to with a view to enforce the precise and constant observance of the stipulations of the present article. "Art. 3. The regalation respecting the closing of the Straits of the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles, established by the treaty of the 13th of July, 14I1, shall remain in force, with the exceptions specified in the following articles.

" Art. 6. In the eveint (which God forbid !) of the Sultan being menaced with aggression, he reserves to himself the right of opening the Straits to all the naval forces of the allies. "After the readirng of the six articles, the Russian Plenipotentaries would be confidentially informed that. considering the reservatiori made by them inthe interpretation of the first article, which declines the engagement to enforce the observance of the independence and territorial integrity df the' Ottoman empire,-considering, moreover, their refusal to agree to any Mmitation of the Russian forces in the Black Ses,-Austria, France, and. Great Britain whilerespectingthe sovereign rightsof Russia, wm lavail themselves of the same rights, by agreeing among them. selves by a formal document- "1L To enforce the observance of the principle established in the first article, in the event of the violation of the independenceandterritorial integrityof the OttoMan empire by Russia. " 2. To consider as a csus elli any inwease of the amaount or strength of the Russian naval fore in the Black Sea beyond its effective force at the beginning of the war. "If Russia should herself engage not to exceed that number the three Powers would consent-not to give publicity to the convention., In the despatch to which the foregoing propositions were attached is the following passages - " If Russia, being placed in a position to agree to the one or the other of these propositions of the ultimetum, should reject both of them, we shall then have proof that she is resolved not to give her assistance to the complete realization of the third guarantee, in as far as its object is to put an end to Russian preponderance in the Black Sea. 'Under such circumustances it would be impossible to do otherwise than consider as exhausted all conciliatory means for bringing about such a peace as the interests of Europe-and our own in particular-require, and the Emperor, our august master, would have recourse to arms as a means of obtaining that peace the want of which is so generally felt." The Austrian Minister then proceeds to say that if the propositions should not mieet vith the approval of the Western Powers, Austria would continue earnestly to desire that the chances of war might put an end to the Russian preponderanee in the Black Sea, "in a way which to England and France might appear mnore on a par with their aerificesthan the rolution proposed" The despatch concludes with the observation that, if her propositions should be rejected, and a favourable opportunity for renewing negotiations for peace subsequently present itself, Austria would not, under any circurnstances, interfere, " except with the fir determination of giving to the four guarantees a positive and efficacious solution." When Sebastopol was taken by the Western Powers, and the Russian fleet had ceased to be, the Imperial Government acknowledged that the victors had a right to dictate more onerOus terms to Russia than those which had been proposed by Austria in the month of May, 1855, and there is reason to believe that this Government first communicated Its impressions on the subject to Count Walewski Aoout two months ago hL de Bourqueney went for a few days to Paris, and before he left this city he had one, if not two audiences, of' the Emperor. If the information given mebe correct,and it probably is so, the French Msnister at this Court wasthe person who first communicated to the Emperor Niapoleon the terms which, in the opinion of Austria, might reasonably be made to Russia. The Austrian propositions underwent a slight modification in France and England, but the terms of peace which, on the 27th of December, 1855, were communicated to Count Nesselrode, were de facto dictated by Austria. A Brussels paper a day or two since insinuated that ny telegraphic despatch of the 30th of December was a mere invention, but the sequel will prove that the information it contained was perfectly correct. The proposition, that that part of Bessarabia lying between the Pruth in the west, Chotym in the north, and the Sasik or Salt Lake in the south, should in future form part of the M0oldavian territory, emanated directly from Austria, and this you may believe, whatever may be said or written to the contrary. PRUSSA (FROM OUR OWN CosEVsPosNDNTr.) BERLIN, Jks. 8. As regards Prassia's support of the Austrian proposals in St. Petersburg, 1 have ascertained to-day that we may wait long enough for a formal note to be sent off from here for that purpose. None has as yet been sent, and apparently none will be. But it seems that very shortly after Count Esterhazy's audience with the King instructions -were sent per telegraph to Baron Werther to renew at the Court of St. Petersburg the representations and remonstrances that his master had alreadysofrequentlyput forward in the interest of peace, but theseinstructions contained nothing about adopting orbackingthe Austrian proposals. This excessively curt and slighting manner of treating them appears, however, to be no more than the correlative of the manner in which they were communicated to this Court with the request that Prussia would back them. The King and his Minister, naturaly enough, felt little inducement to assist Austria in the execution of her schemes on the mere communication of an outline of the result of long negotiations which had scrLilpulously been kept a secret from them. In the manner in which Prussia has conveyed to St. Petersburg the intimation of her wishes I have been at fault,. in so far as I looked for a diplomatic note, while a telegraphic despatch had been used in preference; in the matter composing the subject of the communication I find, however, that I was quite correct in my expectations. The mission of Colonel von Manteuffel to Vienna is assumed by various persons to have different objects in addition to the mere formal delivery of the Kins letter. According to some he is to agree with Austria as to the terms of a jointmotion to be made shortly at the Diet on the subject of an altered position to be assumed by Germany on the Russian question; according to others Prussia, being alaried at the prospect of widely extended operations in the Baltic this sutmmer, is applying to Austria through huni for an assurance of the same support, i case she should be attacked there, as Prussia had guaranteed to Austria in case she should be attacked in the Principalities. As regards this latter version, it is overlooked that this suppot is already guaranteed to Prussia by Austria in the original treaty of April 20, 185%,to which Prussia's promised support to Austria's position in the Danubian Principalities formedi an additional article, concluded November. 26, 1854. The entire Confederation joined in this Aril treaty on July 24, and in the additional article of December 9, so that on this point Prussia can hardly. be under any particular anxiety. As reand the preparation of new motions to be ld -before the Bund, it is also improbable that Prussia should be particularly busy, seeing that she'desires nothing better than to pre3erve the present datuhs qltO; it is not impossible that Atstria herself will soon attempt something of the sort, when the present attempts at peace in St-Betersburghaveattamed a definite result; and suefi;t : 4fact, said to be the object of Count O'Donne's.present visit to Diesden. I asn informed that the lnission of Colonel Manteuffel to Vienna baa no other object than the official presentation of the King's lettero t the Emperor; there may be some other, but at present I have not been able to ascertain if there is any, and what. On the 28th of last month the aniish Government, which had previously fixed the 2d of January for the opening of the conferences, addressed a circular to the representatives of the Powers interested, proposing a further delay tiU fe 4th inst. The plan that seems to be nowr in proess of elaboration s a -newrepartition of the amount.of the Sound dues, ahowinnghow iasueh each Sitet or'group of ,dsem S^ ode$e a thoe.tb ae in the new plan to be brought inder contribution are the-States of the- Zollverein. It appears as if the Danish Goveimahent had not yet come* to the perception of the necessity of an extensive reductioil, if it is to reconcile its many antagonists. The .Amorican Government, which repudiates the right claimed by Denmark to levy Sound dues, recognizes at the same time the equity of Dennuarles being indemnified for the expense she has been at in buoyingand lighting the Sound, and is wlling to payaquotatowards tis and a fair share thwaids the future maintenance of the necessary establishment. For the first purpose the American Goverment seems to be wiling to pay 40,000 thalers, or .6,000L' Quite atthe end of the yearthe Sound wasvisited by such mild weather that the straits were open in every direction, and no trace of ice was visible anywhere. The American cipper Wolga, which has been so long lying thee biding her time, at last, in the full persuasion of meeting no British cruiser in the Bay of Finland, put to sea on Christmaseve. It sems certain that tis vessel had a valuable cargo, chiefIy of arms, on board, and had leen-waiting so long in those waters for an opportunity of bringing them in safety to the Iussian coast. The vessel was built in Boston, and is navigated by a Dane named Holm, perfectly intimate with the Danish waters and the Russian coast. She has been seen since off Bornholm, sailing, with every stitch of canvass strained, towards the Bay of Finland. A Russian merchantnan also, with the Russian flag flying, left Elsinore on the 29th of December, homeward bound, after lying thereperdie for about two years, and it is presumsed that the numerousRussian vessels that.have been so long ice and enemy bound in the Scandinlavian harbours wrill have profited by the extraordinary mild we'ather prevailing theme to return home u3nscathed. RUSSIA. The Invalide Busse, of the 1st of January, tubIishes an extract from Prince Gortschakoffs diary of operations from the 5th to the 16th of December. It says- " In this space of time nothing particular has occurredcin the Crimea, except some reconnaissances and outpost skinmishes. "*Thus, to ascertain as far as possible the position and works of the enemy on the south side of Sebastopol, a sloop and three boats, under the command of Lieutenant DolgoFf, were sent on the night between the ith and 6th December towards the South Bay.* "That bold officer, leaving the boats which brought him between the Paul Batteryana the Woronzoff-roads and quay, landed near the crane, accompanied by Ensign Oskolkofi; Quartermaster Stepanoff, and the pilot Mixhaldof Thence he advanced as far as the docks; but at a short distance frtm the wood-yard he came upon a cor,ps de gaym* | of the enemy sitting round a fire, whereupon he retuned to the sloop. Another attempt to land at the centreof the bridge of South Bay also failed. "After these two attempts, our men took the direction of the lNew Admiralty, and landed near the Matson Carenage. They came upon a sentinel, whom Quartermaster Stepanoff felled to the ground, bat a general alarm was spread among the enemy, and they were compelled to beat a retreat. They limited themselves to a reconnaissance of the side of the bay. Despite the darkness, they wer enabled to ascertain that the allies occupy the Old Admiralty with considerable forces, as also the houses and contiguous magazines. From the shouts of the sentinels it was ascertained that the shore of South Bay is guarded by the English." The InvaZide also publishes a short version of the cavalry affair near Kertch.

A RATIONAL VIEW OF THE WAR (From the .Neo York Jouriorae of Cos-inercc, Dec. 24.) The importnt question presented in the papers brought lay the Asia regarcis the probability of an imnmediate peace_ The point upon w.hich, in our view, the questi6n turns is this,-whether Russia has been, and wiLl be, more benefitted. than damaged by a continuation of the war! It is very evident, from the results of this year's campaign, that tho power of Russia in war has been greatly eaggeated. The alled forces landed in the Crimea on t'a 1fitb of Sepeinber, 1E54. They have occupied it now for more than a eyear, and, instead of beirg expelled by a startling c-lhibition of force, t.e a. ed Iowers, after a tedious and sin- inary struggle, have obtained command over tlhe port of Sebastepol,-a fortress built up by Rnsiia to enable her to carry out her vast schemes of southern territozial aggraridizement,-have destroyed not onlv its buildings, docks, arsenals, and fortifications, but also the fleet which i.sued from it to strike terror into every seaport in the Black Sea. The destruction has been so comuplete, that it is stated that not a piece of wood six inches in length can now be found vithin its limits. linburn, whieh coTamanded the nouth of the Dnieper-of the utmost. consequence to South-Western Russia-vas assaulted by the aliedforcesinthe middle of October, was taken, and is quietly held, greatly to the annoyance of tne trade of the emnpire. Omar Pasha is now engaging the Russian forces within her Transcaucasian ossessons is ende^vou bythe stridtestobsrmnce oF}everv p"'ate "'igt,ito v.in over the variable inhbitants to his cause; aa es aircady accomplished such important rlts by force of arms as seriously to threaten the power of Russa in that important theatre of her operations. Parsof Georgia and Circ have throughout refnscd lo declare alegiance tothe Czar, and other portions vwhich yielded from a inL4aen belif in the o pattne of Russia, more than from desire, may be indu t-o quit tLe army of the empire, and ally themselves to thosewsose policy must necessarily give them the benefits of freedom and intercourse with manlind. Odessa, the great port of Southern Russia, is darnmged and further threatened; the Don,which, after connecting itself by ncans of a canal with the Inighty Volga and the Casli.a, discharges itself into the Sea of Azoff, is also conanuaded by the alles; and the Baltic has been shut up from the very commencement of the war. To a Power xvhich sent its.armies into the Danubian provinces for purposes of conquestthisisa mortifving exhibition. It shows-that Puesia, -withdrawn into her vast shell, relies more on her capacity for endurance and resistance than upon her active ane manly displays of cour-ge and power outside of her dornimions. he pride and spirit of thepeo le, without -whr' no nation can be invinciole, must sinklow under this display. Their ssailants, animated withsuccess, andfecling the justice of their cause, are strengthened and encouraged in the Tatio in which Russia is depressed. Bet what does the next year forebode to the fortunes of the Czar, if peace shouild not be rched 7 The alliance with Sweden as.ures Alexander that the idea of Russian omnninotence-that valuable inheritance of a nation-is fast duindling awayand it intimates that Austria and other States, wihch ilhave hitherto wavered between their wishes ana their fears, ra aid in crippling a Powier which hitherto has advanced witia sure steps around the Erxine, under a prestige of mnanifest destiny that none could dispute. If Sw-eden should join. the allies, ihe fall of St. Petersburg mill be ahulost certain, and the loss of Swedish Finland probable. Riussia, has been a bold and unscruiulous robber on every sidhe of her dominions. Sweden, Polaud, Turkey, and Persia haive each been despoiledof valuable possessions to extend the limits of Ru3ssan empire, andthey Inow firM well the policy as to the future which the past proclaims. The p r the interest of the Czar (tEere are nane ot'hers letn its limits) tell us that preparations are going forward on an immense scale, and that ihe war will be prosecuted with vigour. A new levy of 10 men out of every 1,000 has been ordered, caused, the telegraph from Berlia states, by the dread that Sweden and Denmark'are about to join the WVestmrn alliance. The lery, it says, "has already begwis; but the seson and the exhaustion of the provinces will, it is thought, prevent its prodcLirg the force calculated on." If there had been a force vitlia,the lmliterof Mussia competent to give adequate protection to St. Petersburg it ivoulddhave been sent to Sebastopol, that one of the ancient objects of Russian diplomacy and arms might not be frustrated by its capture-the extension of 3Rusia along thc DardLanelles and Bosphoru7 to the idediterranean, and perhaps by the E}nmhrates'to the Grlf of Peernia. Thefailure to grotect Sebastopol is a confession of wveakness, ehichlthe boasts of Russia through her journals cannot efface. Tie future must be announced to ussia in the pas. She has to choose either the disgrace of pesces or the disrace and the damage of successive defeats. Tne papers tell us that there are no propositions for peace fromnRmssia. There are suggestions, however, from As'tiia, and an omiunous change in the tone of the press in France,. which nusthave an aimortant orig Canrobert arrived at Paris on the 3d of December. There vere intimations that his mission had been successhfL Hi visit to Stockholm bad for its object the most vigorous prosecutioa. of the war. He vass received by the hing with every demonstraticn of espect, and th.e probability ot an alliance having been formed is very great. 'h'be threats to Russia with such an alliance would inv-lve, in connenionss with the disastes to her which have marked t;he yCasl' campaign, are calelated to produ1ce iuggestions tothe allies, or at least to France, of a peacinfi haracter, such as 'wolld lead the Emperor to prepare the naton for their acceptance. Those paperwhich hitherto have been warlike have suddenly urgedthe imnortance of peace to the naticnal interests of the French. If the mi-iohu to Stockholm hba failed it would scarcely have been pm-u. dent, flushed although lisance is with the oronosre of the recent and great victones, to urge the necessity- of peaeo imediatelyYon the ret-un of the French Ambassador, inisMuch as the failure of Canrombert woild have prouceda a necessty for extendirg the warlike feeling in Frince to a still higer pitch. The chances of peace would seem therefore to be strengtLened by recent events; but, such is the hereditary obstinacy Of uassia-such the danier to thfe GovetDment of abandoning a favourite policy to which the mind of the nation has been directed by aU her Sovcreigns -sachtheimnpracticability of her rnlers, and so powerrfut the influence of passion, actig under die-ppo'ointnent and mortified pride-that it rould not be safe to predictb a speedy ictirn ef peace.

L LAST EXJEDTIOV IN S EAH0 OF sMB JORlY FRAN.KLIN.W The following is a copy of a letter from Chief Factor James Anderson to Sir George Simpson, Governor-in-Chief of Ilupert's Iand, dated Fort Resolution, September 17, 1855 - `Fort Resolution, Sept. 17, 1855. 'Sir,-I beg to state for your inforination that the expedition you were pler.Fed to intrust to my command returned here last night. "After lhaving descended Bac es Great Fish River, and explored the mlnl:m..nd -,d islands as -far as Macooebie's Island, undoubted troces of the missing party were fourd at Montreal Lland, but I regret to say that neither the reniailas of our unfortunate countrymen, mor any perscns were discovered.. My previous despatches would have infomned you that I arrived at Fort Resolution late on the 2Cth of June. The three canioe luilt under the superintendence of Messrs. Stewart andRoss were already; they were of an excellent model, the woodwork very strong, but the bark, though the best that could be procured at so5 bort a notice, vws very inferior. They were, of course, very heavy, their ladings amounted to 24 pseces of 901b. each, and consisted chiefy of provisions, with a good supply of ironwcorks, kc.. for the Ejsquimaux, anununitiOsi. nets, Halkett boat, and tho luggage of the party. Daouble aets of poles, p.addles, and lines were also provided. Fifteen men and an Indian guideto Sue ILake composed tbe cress; but I found wo werer too weakly manned, and added three Yellov.-knife Indi3ns w;ho wvished to go to tbeir lands. The only thing wantingwas an Esquimaus interpreter. 1' Late on the evening of the 22d of June the epedition made a move to an isand about a uile from the ForL Heavy gales from the north-east detained us between there and RookyPoint, where the traverse is taken till the 27th ; these, hawever, cleared our road of ice. On the 28th we encamped at the upper end of Tal-thel-lelh Strait; we then fell-in with the ice, it was about two feet thick. We were employed till the morning of the 2d of July in, making our way through it, by cutting, pushinz the pieces apart, and mnaking portages over the points of liad; young ice formed every night, and the further we advanced the sounder it got; the canoes too, unavoidably, received some injury. 'At that date we had reached the place called 'the Mountain' in Back's map, snd mnentioned in his narrative, as he' a route to the barren grounds, but onlypracticable for lndian canoes. The guide engaged by Mfr. Stewart was unacqulainted vith this route;* he proposed takinguls by a river falling into Great Slave Lake on its eastern shore, nearly opposite to Fort Reliance. By means of this river, oe lakes, and ten portages, he intended to round thhead of Great Slave Lak;e and fall eventually at the Bearerlodge in Artillery Lake. "H Hoar-frost River, which Sir GeormeBackascended with dificulty in a halfIsized light canoe ma the autumn, would have beeu at this season impraoticable. To get through the ice to either of th^se rivers would have occupied a long time, and then Artillery, Clinton, Colden, and Aylmer lakes were still before us - it was clear that, if some other route were not adopted, die expedition would faiL Here was our only chance. One of the Indians had passed by this route as far as the river, falling into the upper end of Aylmer Iake; he gave a disheartening description of the difficulties to be sunnounted, and the high range of mountains before me was anything but encouraging. I, however, determined en making the attempt, as the route was so much shorter, and we might also expect to have a long stretch of open water on lAke Aylmer at the rnouth of the river. "Imnmediately after breakfast the portage wras begun, and, though four trips were made before we encamped, the canoes and ladigs were carried over 3. miles of mountains and across a sl lake. At 1.30 p. our fine fellowswere des-ending a steep mountai nwiththe canoes, singng -La Violette.' The nextday'swork,wassomethingsimilar;the third was a little better, after which the mountains subsided to gentle hills, and the lakes were larger, some of them from 20 to 40 miles in length. In short, after passing through 24 lakes and 25 portages, we reachedthe river falting into Lake Aylmer (which I bare catled Outram rinver after a gallant relative late on the 7th of July. Two esy rapids and about 12 miles of river brought us to Laice Aylsuer. "I had now to trust to myown guidance. As I bad anticipated, we found the lake at its mouth free from ice, and had fine paddling for about 30 railes. When we fell in vdth the ice, the whole Lake appeared solid snd unbroken; the ice ws abcout three feet thick and perfectly sound. "ThSEe north side of the lake whics we followed is indented with deep bays, separated from each other by narrow necks of land; round these and close to the shore we had to work our way by cutting, poling, and numerous portages across points, with occasional pieces of open water at the bottom of the bays. There were also some crevasses throeghwhicht we pssed at a great risk of being nipped we had sevenl hair-breadth escapes; indeed, one of the canoes was once only saved by pushing poles under her I bottom and Allowing her to De lifted on the ice. We finaUy arrived, with our canoes much injured, at Sandhill -Ba on the 11th of July. 6' We had now the advantage of Sir C. Back's map an(d narrative; the former, the one attached to his booe was oa far too small scale for our purpose, but the latter was of greatsevice. "It is needless for me to describe the descent of this dan-i gerous river after the minute and correct description of our1 gallant predecessor, notwithstanding the exquisite skill of our Iroquois Boutes; the canoes were repeatededly broken and much strained in the whirlpools and eddies. The river to the small lake falling into ask-oxLake was nearly dry, and the portage worlc was most severe. "On the 13th of July Mfusk-Ox Rapid was reached; here we found a few Yellow-knife Indins. " Our four Indians and onemanwereleft here; the latter, -with one of the Indians was to return to Great Slave Lake to join 3r. Lockhart, and the expedition now consisted of thte following persons.- "James A.nderson, first command; J. G- Str-.wart, second command; B. Assniyonton, Ignace Montour, and Joseph Anarize, Iroquois boutes; Thomas Misteagun and Paulette Papanaldes, Mstuskegon steersmen; John Fidler, halfbreed steersnan; Henry Fidler, Edw,ard Kipling, George Daniel, and Donald 'Leod, halfbreed midmen; Jerry Johnston, Muskegoni midman; Joseph Boucher, Canadian midinanMfurdo MLellan, Highlander midman; and William Reid: Orkneyman midman. " On the 15th, the worst canoe, vwich was completely worn out, was left, and we now proceeded with heavier ladings, but better crews. On the 20th the first Esquimaux were seen at the mouth of and below Mackinley's River. There were five lodges, and we visited two of them. We here found the want of an interpreter. We had two of Dr. Xaes mnen, who understood a few words and phrases, and with the aid of signs they made us understand that they came down Mackinley's River. They were not much alarmed, and we soou got excellent friends. "They had evidently seen whites, or had communication with others of their countrymen (most probably those whol resort to Churchill), who had intercorse withthem, as they possessed a few of our daggers, beads, files, and tin kettles - and ore old man brought down some wolf skins to barter, They were clothed entirely in deer and music-ox skins Their canoes were made of deer parchment, and not a piece of sealakin was seen among them. " Aiother smahlparty was seen at the rapid between Lakes: Pely and Garry. The men appeared to be all absent, and the women and children fled on seeing us. Some small presents were left in the lodgaes to show our kindly intentions. " In Lake Garry we had to work throughi about 15 miles of ice; but, although ice was observed in some of the other lakes, we met with no further obstruction from this cause. " On the 30th, at the rapids below Lake Franldin, three Esquimaux lodges were seen on the opposite shore, and ahortly after an elderly man crossed to us. After the portage was made we crossed over, and immediately perceiv-ed various articles belonging to a boat, such as tentpoles and kayack paddles made out of ash oars, pieces of anabogany, elm, oak, and pine; also copper and sheet-iron boiler, tin soup tareens, pieces of instruments, a letter nip with the date 1843, a broken handsaw, chisels, he. Only ome man was at the lodges, but the women, who were very intelligent, made us understand by words and signs, that these articles came from a boat, and the white men belonging to it had died of starvation. "We, of course, by showing them bools and written papers, endeavoured to ascertain if theypossessed any papers, oferig to give them plenty of the goods we bad with us for them; but, though they' evidently understood us, thley said they had none, hney did not scruple to show us all their hidden treasures. Besides the man, there were threewomen and -eight-children. The remainder of the party, two men and three lads, were seen towards evening. " Point Besufort was reached on the Islt. *We were detained there the next day till half-past 2 p.m. by a S.l. gale. We then took the traverse to hontreal Island. To seaward the ice appeared perfectly firm and unbroken. " When about three miles from the island, a large streamn of ice was observed coming at a great ratebefore the wind and tide out of Elliott's Bay and the other deep bays to the westward. Every sinew was strained to reach the land; but we were soon surrounded by ice, and for some time were in xnost imminent dAnger. The iee was from six to seven feet thick, perfectly sound, and drifting at the rate of five or six miles an hour. In 15 minutes after we had passed thewhole channel to Point Beaufort vws choked with ice. Had we not succeeded in crossing on this day, we should have been detained on the eastern shore till the 10t - "We had thus arrived at the first spot indicated by my-in. structions onprecisely the samae day as our gallant predecessor, Sir P. Back. "The next two days were devoted by the entire party to the examination of the island, and tho small islands in its vicinity. On a high ridge of rocks at the south-east point of the islnd a number of Euimaux caches were found, and, besides sel oil, various articles were found belonging to a boat or ship- such as chain hooks, chisels, blacksmith's abovel anddcod chisel, tin ova boeler, a bar of ltwroufth iro about three feet long, one and a-half inch broad, an a quter of an inch thick - small pieces of rope, buntin, and a number of aticks strung together, on- one of which wsW cut ' Mr. Stanley' (surgeon of Erebus). A little lower down wa a lage quanti of chipr, shavings, and ends of pknk of pine, elm, ash, el, and mabogany, endently sawed b uskilful hands; every chip was turned over, and on oneof theni was found the word 'Terror' carved. It was evidentthatthis was the spot where theboat was cat up by the uimaux. Not even a scrap of paper could be dis- wered, and though rewards were ofered, and the most m£nute serh made over the wholU islad, not a vestige of the rmain of our unfortuate countrymen couldbediscovered- "OntheSthwesuccededincrcesingovertothewestern mai;n7and, opposite to hfontreal Iland, and the whole party Was eqn ed in mang a most mindtei,earch as far as the zt, olIott-'s Bay, and ao to the northward.

Shortly after leaving the encanapment a river was forded- thismustbe a large stream at a high stage of water. It was balled Iemisieurier River, after a relative of hr. Stewart's. Nio fuel was found in our encampments, and in two hours ile left l signs of vegetation behind. The remainder of'the peninsas compsed of high sandhills intersected bydeep valley4 evidently overflowed at spring tides and 4urig gales. We encamped late opposita Maconochie's Island, and. the only vestige of the missing party found vas a small piece of cod-line, and a strip of striped cotton about twro n2ches long and an inch broAdL These were found at Point Ogle, ian arEsquimaux encampment of perhaps the or four years of. age. "$Next morning a piece of open waterenabled.us to launch the Halkett boat , and explore aconochie's Idland, but nothing woas found. It was impossible to cross over to Point Richardson, as I 'wsed, the ice drising through the strait betaeen it and laconoclde's Island at a fearful rate. About 3 o'clockintheafternoon we began to retrace our steps through a tremendous storm of wind and rain. The last 4f the party did not reach the tncampment til past :10 o'clock at mght, and, as there was no fuel, wre were': obliged to creep under our blxankets thoroughly wet, and with no other supper but a piece of od and rather ancient pemmican. It 'was now evident that all that could be done with our means had'beenuaccomplished, and that, with our frail craft, any delay in returnmg Lwould compromise the safety of the whole party.: It may be thought strauge that the remamis of so lage a party could not be discovered. It is my opinion that a party in a starving condition would have chosen a low spot, where they could haul their boat up and have had some shelter * and that, if they 'erished there, their bones have beeu long since covered by sand or gravel forced upby the ice. Any books or papers left open would be destroyed by the perpetual winds and rain in this quarter inavery shortspace of time; for instance, alarge book, IP 9S Na cigebo fws left open on a cloak at Montreal Island; it ras bown open; and the leaves werepattering about insuchaway that had' it not been instantly dlosed it would soon have been torn in pieces. "iNo party coudi winter on this coast. In the first place there is not enough fuel- and, secondly, no dieer pass. About 100 deer, mostly bucica were seen on AdeLaide Peninsula on our way to Point Og'le, but not one on cur way-hack. Their tracls were all seen going to the south. On the eastern coast only five deer were seen. It would also be a matter of immense difficulty to get sufEleient supplies down Fish River for even a small party. " Oin the lOth of August a shift of wi3nd enabled us to cross over to Point Beaufort without injury, and a gale brought us to Point-Backhouse at half-past 10 p.m. " The Esquimaux were still at the rapids of Lake Franklin. Another attemnpt was made to see if they possessed papers of any description; the contents of our trading cases were offered or any. They showed us all theircaches, but nothingof interest was discovered. "The fishery of fresh water herrbig an) trout appeared to be over, as those we saw hanging to dry on our way down were all stowed away securely in aches, and the party were on the ei-e of departure to hunt deer. H Handsome presents were made to them, for which we got boots for most of the nen. The Upper Esquimaux were also seen and treated in a similar manner. "The weather durinn the whole trip up was dreadful, bloming continually with rain, snow, and hail, and it froze. sharply below and above Lake Beechy. Our canoes also were very frail and leaky. There was still less waterin the upper part of the river than on our way down. From the lake above Musk Ox Lake to ILke Ayhner was almost one continuous portage. That Lake was reached early on the 31st of August " Our progress through the lakes was much retarded by strong headwinds and fogs. Some time was also lost in finding the very narrow and hidden outlets of Lake Aylmer and Chi'ton Colden; at the latter I was disappointed at not finding Indians. " Early on the 9th we reached a bay at the end of Artillery Iake, on the east shore, nearthohead of thelAheldesy. It wag impossible to descend that river, and we were enlployed the reniainderof the day in discovering an Indian road to Great Slave Lake through a series of small lakes and a smsll river. After passing through eight snall lakes, and making as many portages, we reached the river, and soon after got sight of Slave Lake. A portage of five miles was mnide with the pieces; the canoes were partly brought down by wter. Mr. Stewart and I reached old Fort Relianccwhere the new establishment was alse erected, about 3 p.m. of the 1lth, and the canoes arrived at 10 the nezt morr.ng. "A as there was no prospect of discovering anjthing more from this quarter, I couceived that I was not-justified in incurri-ig further expense or risk, and, according to your instructions, determined on sending out the people this falL "I Ir. Lockhart had left the day previous to iny arrival with two small boats, which, with their ladings, were to have been put en cache at Sussex Lake, in the event of the expedition having been continued another seaso. I sent off tw-o men immediately to recall him. Mr. Stevart remn2ined to pack up everything at the fort, while I left on the 12th awt 2 p.n. to stop the boat coming from Resolution wth supplies. "lXo privation was sustained by the party for want of provisions. We brought three pemlnican back. Sir George Back saw immense numbers of deer and musk oxen on his way down. We only saw a few scattered deer with their fawns, the bucks haigall passed to the north, and a few herds of musk oxen. On our way down no time was lost in hunting these, aBs w,-e got as many Canada geese asvre wished by running them down, they were moulting, and were all ganders. on our way up many tracky s weac seen going south, but no deer until we arrived at ysiDoulls Lake and then only- a few does. At the head of the river, and in Lake Aylmer and Clinton Colden, they passre pretty numerous, and anig them nany buckss i in fie coneition. The followng is our game listc:-289 geese, s5 deer, 1 musk "The conduct of the men was beyond all praise; -thes sustained hardships ad rsiks of no ordiarydescription, not only with cheerfulness, but with gaiety. The weather 6n the vroyage up wmas very severe. Not a day passed without ran, sleet, and hail falling betwveen Point Eackhouse and Mlusk Oxc Like, afir which w1e had occasionaL SIns das Sone of the party were provided with waterproof clothes or bags ; the canoes also were very leaky.

PBrZCBSS'g THEATRE. AlU over thd world it will be fonrid, we believe, thit each -tivc country, COMMminty, and fanmy has some -highday or holydayto itself, the importance of which is not egulated by the calendar. Bretagne has saints of its own totally ignored by the rest of the Catholi. world;, Priw revres Shrove Thesday as the festival of the" k uf -Itaz London has its Lord Mayor's-day; Coventry rejoices in the memory of the Lady Godiva; and England generally hEs a sort of baa saint in tho person of Guy Fawkes; wbo ii far more renovned than many a good one. - So in families. In one a birthday, in another a wedding-day is the occasion of periodical co stUlakLous, wiAth mo-oher holyday is allowed to supersede. Just such a festivity is the night on which Hamkl is periodically revived at the Princess's Theatre. A long series of dramus,-outvying each other itth 'their successive splendour, has been produced at this establishment since the- present manager first played the Danish Prince on boards subject to his own dominion, 'ut Hamlet mnore modestly put uponi tho stage is never cast into the shade. Its -revival is the signal for a house more than, usually crowvded, and for plaudits more than usualy vociferous, in houo,= of tFe tragedian. It is repeated atsomewhatlongintervals-say, of a week-and thusit has a freshness, vwhich :endttes, till it is withdrawn for the-year, to be revived- with similar solemnities in the course of the following seasoi. - For this peculiazity it is,. by nb means, difficult-to &ccount. After his. career as an actor of what is cdaled "juvenle trazt&d' hra. termruted, l&r. Chailes Sean commenced in 1837 thatcourse, which has continued- with light intermission down tn the present time, -by playing HamleC at Drury-lane. Hence, rhen he revives this W. .icular tragedy, he maybe considered to celebrate his professional birthday, varying the date to suit, his convenience, just as some people will, at their good will and pleasure, eat TwelUthcale on the 7th inead of the bth of JaLnuary. Bnt there is a more hestetical reason for reckoning the revival of Bamtet at the Princess's a sort of festivity. In the erlydays of Mr. Charles Kean.(w&e nct allide tothe ",juvenile" period), his Hamlet had a celebrity tptally distinct from that of any other character on his then short Est, being the part above all the rest that indicated the - qualities he displays at the present day. Persons who do notoften frequent the theatre are apt to talk of .Ur. Charles Kean as if he were precisely in the same histrionic condition as in the year 1837), wlheraa hiz- prsent style is not only different from that vith which he bega'x his career, but is founded on a tota.ly opposite principle. Then he rather sought to Etartle by isolated points than. to elaborate a chaTacter from beginning to end; now he is the sedulous, conscientious artist, with whom every line is equaly worth reflection, and who, far from being satisfied with flashes of effect, first grasps a conception, and then pursues it down to its minutest details. It was this finished elaboration that gave so much effect to his melodramatic characters, and raised them i5so far above the level on which the author seemed to bave jplaed them, that his former detractors began to pause mn their censures, and admit that he was excellent in melodrama even before his Louis XM. came as a crowning effort, and convinced the most unwillin- that his talents could give effect to the highest order of dr-ais without any aia from scenic decoration. Some, indeed, endeavoured to account for the phenomenon by the hypothesis that he had carefully studied Ligier at Paris, and brought back all bis "business." No theory could be moere absurd. As well might it be supposed that an engraver could stand for about a quarter of an hour at some exceddingly complicated picture in a public galery, and then, retuming home, execute a perfect copper-plate from memory. Now, it issworthy oD remarX' that lanilet-biis very first character-showed that desire for consummate finish which belongs to his present style of acting, and coinpletely separates it from the manner of his other early impersonatious. (If late ears his comae baa been rapidly and tmnistakediy upwards, and, if the successive melodramatic characters1were so many preparations to the Louis, the fall of Wolsey, with all its complexity of emotion, came as a convincing proof thaLt the - tion c¶ ol BelagipEs conception was not a mere happy accident,-the result of a transient inspiration, but the manifestation of a mind that could really probe a character to its depths, and reveal thle discoveries it had made. The revival of Hamlet this year is marked by sll the wel known finish of the actor-by all the wonted enthusiasm of the audience. __
THE COMIf SSIOEERS OP LIErTEXANCY FOR THE CITY Of LONDON. TO THE EDnrOP. OY T5M TM&Z. Sir,-You published in your valuable journal of the 7th inst,, a letter signed "A Commissioner, 'who, in discharge of his dnty, has made himself, acquainted with the facts,' containing such a violent attaclk uponme, in consequence of some observations I felt called upon to make at the recent Corribill wardmote, with respect to the proposed buildingsfor the `brracls ` nM ead-quaers oi the City o london MsiLtia, that I feel you wil in justice insert a few wvords from me in self-defence. I am quite content to leave any question as to my motives to the judgnent of those who have known me during a long course of pablic life, and will deal only with the facts. I deny that I am, or ever have been, averse from the niilitary exercises in the Arllery-ground, nor have I ever been opposed to providing suitable head-quarters for the regiment. I also deny that I got up an opposition to the. bill in tlie House ef Lords,- but, on. the contray, I asseit tQd the opposition to the bill was determined upon by the Court of Common Council on a recommendation of the City Lands Com. mittee, of which comnmittee I was not a member, and knew nothing of their proceedings until their report came under consideration on the 24th of May, 1855,* wvhen the Court ,greed to their recommendation, and ordered the opposition a; foUows ---"%We are of opinlon that the erection of barracks and a hospital for the Royal London Mfilitia, 3; proposed by the said bill, will not only entail a large annual expense upon the citizens of London, but ill also be a great inconvenience and a nuisance to the inhabitants of the city and the neighbourhood of Finsbury-square, and that the said biUl ought to be opposed." I certainly did move, as a member of the Court of Lieiitenancy, on the 16th of November, 1855,-" That the report from the Head-quarters Committee be received, and that it be referred hack to themn to reDort to tl)s Clvvtfer its approval wlhat plan they would recommend for the building of the proposed head-quarters, and in the meantime they take no further steps in respect of the purchase of the property scheduled." But my object, as is evident from the resolution itself, was first to determine how much ground would be requiredfor the purpose of building suitable head-quarters, ixfore pmrchasing more thzn might be necessary, and it has since been proved that my suggestion was not without reason. Having thus disposed of the a-alle "f adts, I wil leave the reader to determine as to the justness of the epithets applied to me. I now proceed to the next series of charges, the first of which is, that I well knew it never was intended to erect barracks for the City of London Militia. In reply to this bold assertion, relying upon the accuracy of the report from the City Lands Committee before referrea to, I say distinctly that it was intended to build barracks, including a hospital and general head-quarters; and, farther, that the plans and elevation for which burildings were produmcd by Mfr. Jennings, the architect to the Court of Lieutenancy, before the commnittee of the House of Lords in my presence. The total expenditure for the proposed building cannot be ascertained until t'he accounts are made upafter theworks are completed, and the estimate is stil quite a matter of opinion; the szum -of 60,000b. which I mentioned as the probable amount had been named by others during, the dicassion on the subject in the Court of Common Council in the nionth of May last. Byreference to the mrinutes of the Court of Lientenancy, dated the 16th of November last, I find it reported by the Hlead-quarters Committee that they had taken land and houses for head-quarters for a term of 99 years, at 500M. per annum, and a premium of 9,000L1; consequently, the statemert I mvade to the wardmote was perEectly correct. The report, I admit, does also state that the committee had agreed to underlet some part of the property at a rent of 1831. 6s. 8d. per annum, and a premium of 3,001. -; b1tr on the other hand, it is quite silent as to the large pay. ment which would have to be made to the corporation as a compensation for their not having a renewal of their present lease of th PTroperty, nois a word said of the compensations to be paid to the various tenants, the aggregate amount of which payments, I believe, will very much exceed the amount which will be recouped by the s,eletng. I am, however, happy to notice it stated by your corre- spondent that. there is a plan of the intended building now. under the consideration of the committeo. Very probably I ma.ylhae no objection to offer to that plan - bumy observations were directed against a plan prepred in May last of so expensive a character that (represenrt, the rapayers of thiswnrd) Ifelt bound to opposc its adoption, na Ila* grAtifiedto find Xth the oppoefilon hs been thus far sue- Ihave the honour to remaiu, Sir, Your obedient servant. _- YDWAD HAMMSDI. .

With from 201b. to 211b. of pressure uporL the sqne inch she easily made 18X. statute iles an Ihour,-hile th Paddles gare 17i to 18 rev6lutions in the S -minute. Tis di. however, was reserved -for the forshal trial or pleasure trip, and at the smne.time for the final dep ar ure of the shipftom the C:lyde fot theMIersey,whence she aparts for New York on the 26th current. The M3fessrs. Burns of this city, the resident and *principal sharaholders in- the Cunard Company, had invite distinguished party to enjoy the occasion, and at half-past 8 they lefthy specl. train for Greenock, whence they were carried to the tersi in a tender, where they met with a cordial reception from Captain Judkins, the fnture commander of the suhip. The .-partyon board mustered220 ladiesandgentlemen, including peers,- Glasgow- merchants, countrt gentlemen, Crimean heroes, &c. The dayw surpassingly lovely. The-stm - speedily brushed away the morning frost, and shone outwith unclouded splendour,- while there vas scarcely a ripple on the sex. The ship speedily proceededon her way, and stretched down under easy steam- a few miles past the - umbrae Iighthouse.. With only 15 pounds of pressure and 16J revolutions she made the - distance between Cloch and gnumbrae; the usual testing ground onthe Clyde, in 58 minutes, -a -distance of- 15-2-3d miles. But this day's trip was not by anymeans intended for atrial of speed, being in every sense of the word a- pleasure sail; and an epportusrity for testing the real- powsers of the shipbeing reserved for the passage to Liverpool, for which -she wras te sail on returning wvith the part. It is enough to say that the ~perforanttces of the Persia onuthe Clyde excited the adnmtion of all. - : The Persia, as we have said, is built of iron, and her ngines are constructed by Messrs. Robert Napier and Sons, She was launched in the Clyde on the 3d of July last, and the interveing pod has been fully occupied inlaying her machinery, and hittinB her out as the moet magnificent 'doating hotel and goods transport that has ever breasted the waters - - This, as we have said, is the largest steamship afloat in the world-far exceeding in -length, strength, tonnage, and steam power the Great Briain or the EIimalaya, andexceedlag also by no less than 1,200 tons the internal capacity of the larges;t-of the present splendid Cunard linEers. Her chief proportionsmflay be stummed up as follov,s- Length from figurehead to-taifrail .. 390 feet. -Length in the water . . ,. 360 ,, Breadth of the hull ... ... ... 45 Breadth over all ... ... ... 7 , : Depth ... ... ... ... 32, Burden ... ... ... ... ... 3,600 tons. )iameter-of paddlewheels ... ... 40 feet. - Mcerding to thse tstict Governmentrule of admeasurernent, her powrer is equal to that of 900 horses; according to the plan laid dowfn in the Earl of HXardwvicke's bill, her power is equal to that of 1,200 horses; and according to Wasne5 Watt's old established rule of 33,0001b. to the horse, she is expected to work up to the pitch of between 4,000 and 5,000 horses. - Stupendous as the Persia is, the lines of beattty have been so wel weorked out in the pieparation of her model that her appearance is singularly graceful and lightsome. Yet this miighty fabric, so beautiful as a whole, is made up of innumerable pieces of ponderous metal, welded, jointed, and rivetted into each other 'with exceeding deftness. The framing of the ship is very heavy. The space between each frame is only 10 inches, and the powerful frames or nbs are themselves 10 inches deep, with double angle irons at the outer and inner edges. Tbe bow is constructed in a manner at once peculiar and affording the test possible strength to this impOrtant part of the ship. The framfing is so placed to the stern, that tbe effect is that, in the case of colision with otr d or with roks, or icetergs, the strain would fal upon the very strongest mdaterial within the structure, and the Persia would have a good chance of safety and successful resistance wdhile orTe vessells would indeed be in great periLi She is not clinker-built, as some ships lave been constructed of late. The plates or outer planking of the ship, so to speak. are laidalternntely, so that one adds strength to the other, and they form a wnole of w.onderful compactness and solidity. The keel plates are 11-16ths o ah in thickne t the b of atthe ship theaplates are 11-6ths of an inch in thickness; from this -section to t'ae load water-line they are g of an inc'h; and above this they are 11-16ths of an inch in thic};ness. - The p1ates round the gumvnale are aths of an inch in thickness. The Persia has seven water-tight compartments. The goods are to be stowed in two of these divisions, each about 90 feet long, by 16 in breadth, and 20 feet in height. These gooD& stores, orrather tanks, aroplaced in the centreline of the ship, with the coal cellars or bunklers on each side of them. At the same time, the vessel is so constructed as to have in readity adoublebottoni under these goodB' chambers, so that it the euter -were beat in orinjured, the inner won1d, in all likelihood, protect the eargo dry and intact. The chambers are perfectly water-tight; and in tlle event of accident to the hul these tanks would of thenmselves float the ship. The liner has two enines, and eight large tubular boilers and two -funnels; and, we need only speak of her machinery in general, wihch is all ready, as being first-class. The firing pace for the boilers is placed in the fore and aft lin, intead of across the ship, as is usually the case with smaller vessels. She- has separate sleeping accommodation for 260 passengers, disposed along what maay be called the main deck, lying immediately above the goods and coal stores. These cabins have each 8 feet 6 inches of head room, and, coupled with the excellentsystemof ventilation introduced into allthe Cunardliners, we needscarcelysaythattbeywillbeahke pleasant, airy, and healthfuL Exclusive of the wholesome accommodation for the officers and engineers, there are in the forward part of the ship about 120 berths for the sailing crew, firemen, and stokers. The total number of persons employed in worlnng the ship, froin the captain downwards, is 150. Above the main- deck there is a deck-house covered in, the roof of which affords apromenade from stem to stern. It contains the main dining saloon, about 60 feet in length, by 20 feet in wvidth, and 8 feet in height. it is copiously lighted, from the sides by plates of glass placed in the alternate panels. In front is that important adjunct, the pantry, which has about 300 square feet of area ; and before the funnels is the kitchen, of equal size, 'with its cookig ranes, exceeding most and equaling any of the culinary esabliEsments of the most extensive an noted hotels in the kingdom. Buxt we have not space to enter farther into detail than to say that on this deck and below it wre also to be founithe bakery, the butchef s shambles, the escullery, the cowhouse, the carpenter's workshop, the lamphouse, the doctor's shop, the icehouses, the bathrooms, and no fewe- than 20 waterclosets. The weight of theironin therersia, whenlawanched, was 2,200 tons. When the engines are on board, and fully loaded, the weight of the immense mass will be 5,400 tons, at which time she will draw 23 feet of weter. Her coal cellars are constructedto receive 1,400 tons of coal-an ample supply to carry her on her voyage across the Atlantic as fast as she can burn them. She has also accommodation 'for about 1,200 tons' measurement of goods. This may be considered small when the extraordinary capacity of the Persia is considered; but it must be remembered that her man design is that of a floating hotel, and that the goods of the liners of Messrs. Burns are principally those by which the manufacturing ingenuity and refinement of the East i minister to the comfort and luxury of the West. LIVERPOOL, JAN. 10. The large new iron paddle-wheel steamer Persia, recently built at the yard of Messrs.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES Sir,-In this mornin's paper I noticed some account of a letter written by the Bishop of Exeter on Dr. Lushington's recent jud"ment about the fittings of Protestautchurches. Mis Lords%ip, itappear% is at a loss to Imow what " credencetable' exactly means-he cannot tell whence it is derived, and evidentlylabours unaer some mystery about it. Ilight Istate, for the information of such of your readers as bare not lived in Italy and mixed with the reople, that the word is of Italian derivation, and is used in ordinary tonversation? La asedena means nothing more than a small cupboard or shelf in any handy situation, serving to stow avay any odd matters that may be wanted at a moinent's notice. La.credenza is not necessarily a piece of religious fwnitore, nor has it any connexion wvith religiouls rites per se. There is Zas credenza deU (da tr4 la credenza deZ ktatdsterio, I:a credenza dcl' oZio santo, and there is a credtenza in everybodv's chamber. So the wcord is not so very Popish as the bi op seemed to fea.r. Younrs rpsnnctfnltv T. A T. C1bWTFR. Priest of the Eremito Order of bt. Augmstine. Chatham, JT. 9.
Tn STATrU OFCRAIrL , At CH&RM-G-OROSS. -For some time past it had been noticed that the statue of Ring Charles L, at Chnring-cross, was evlidently becoming very insecure npon tho pedestal, and, in consequence, it was examined by several competent persons, wvho at once pronounced it to be so; but not untitho repairs were commnenced wvas the danger in wvhich this ancient monumuent stood fully discovercd.

'There lisa been mnuch discontent, and many complaints have been made lately by seamen of having been compelled.- by the lo'cal magistrates in tho seaports to go to sea inship3 which were unseaworthy and il-manned, after egning ar. .ticfes; or be fitreated ts deserters and commi o prison.

The enactments bearing upon the subject are l7th and 18th of Victoria, chap. 104, ses. 243, 246, 247, and -248, which provide for the apprehension aud punishment. of deserters; and xec. 149, which -provides for the proper signatureof articlesin a form sacioned by the Board of Trade, and whih requires the t one ef the terms-in the articles shall be the number and descriptLon of the wrel, saec amyingho msanyare engaged as osilors. A copy of the form of aticles sanctioned by th of Trade also aecoinpined'te case. The opinionof the Quoeen's Advocate, the Attorny and Solicitor General, was reqrested upon the following points:- 1 Whether, when a seaman is engaged, there is or is not an implied condithon on the part of the shipowner that the cap shall be sehworthy? 2. Whether, if the ship isnDt seaworthyo and the seafathe efused to go to sea in her onthat ground, hie can be treated as adeserter, orpiishedunder the enactments above re- I forred to, or otherwise? 3. Whether, if a seamban is apprehended on the ground to desertiono, and alleges in his defenoe that the stp iso unseaworthy,it istheduv es t e Cort iwhich hears the I easeto ex a ine into the qstion, and to receive such evideuce as it may he possible to procure of the trath of the allegation?I 4. Whether, if the ship is not seaworthy, and the seaany refuses to go to sea in her on that ground, and the master and owner refuse to deliver any clothes or effects which the seanan has on board, the seaman can bring an action to recover them, or to recover damaes for their detentions 5. Whether, if a seaman serves in a sip aneich is sent to Sea in antnseaworthy state, and the suhp is lost in coniequence, and the samanptherebynsuffers dtmage by lhos of his clothes, or by injury to his person or otherwise, he has any remedy against the osnerw- 6. Whether, when a searaan is esiaed,there is or is not an iinplied condition on the part of the owner that the ship shall be adequately manned (i. c*. manned in such a manrner nawould, under ordinaxycircumstances, be sufficient for the safetysnd propernanhgationof the ship on the voyage on which she is to be employed); and, if so, whether or not the non-performance of this condition is attended by eonseqensenes simnilar to those which would attend the non-performnance of the imnplied condition that the ship shall ho seaworthy, assuming such last-mentioned conditionl to exist?. , "Orrimrox. " We are of opinion that there is an implied condition ou the part of the shipowner that the ship shall be seaworthy. "'2. And that if the ship is not seaworthy, andthe seaman refusestogoto sea in heron thatground, he cannot be. treated as a deserter, or punished under the enactmnent referred to. But the burden of proof will lie on the seaman; he must establish the tnseaworthiness of the vesseL " 3. If theseamanapprehendedfordesertion allegesthe imseaworthiness of the ship inhisdefence, it will be tYieduty of the Court which hears the case to examine into the question, asitwouldso onanyotherdisputedquestionoffactthatmight arise cefore it; and it must dispose of the question on such evidence as may be laid before it, bearing in mmnd, as we have before said, that the burden of proof is on the seamnan. "4. We think that the searuanis justifiedin refusing to go to sea in the ship onthe grounld of her unseaworthiness, and may maintain an action to recover his effects if detained. "5. On theanthority of the case 'Psiestly v. Fowles' (3 11. and W., p. 1), we are of opinion that a seaman proceeding to sea in aa unseaorthy ship, and sustaining injury in consequence, could not maintain an action, and wouald be without a remedy against the owner. 6. We are of opinion that there is an implied condition on the part of the owner that the ship shall be manned by a crew sufficient to navigate her with reasonable safoty, and that if she be not so maanned tlhe consequences will be the same as though the ship was unseaworthy. ,," JD.

"To THO Mosr GiAcIous MAsEsry T1es QuEaj, ",May it please Your Mjesty to receive the humble cowplaints of as loyal a body of subjects as there is to be found within your realms, and to listen to the prayerof the seamen of Great Bitamn. " Your memorialists have to complain, that of late years the course of legislation has been the indirect means of lessening security of life at sea. L By the excessive co-n petition of British with foreign shipping. 2. By cormpeling owners of ships to employ masters or mates, in whom-although they may have certificates of competency -they have no faith as good seamen. 3. By destroying the nationality of a ship's crewv, and thus permitting an unlimited erniloyment of enfeebled Lascars and foreigners under the British fage, speaking vaions languages, and rendering discipline not easy of accomplishment, and the word of command more difficult to be understood. Your memxorialists, in part confinnation of what is here advanced, would direct your Majesty's attention to the ' Register of Wrecks published by 'the lords Commissioners of the A^dmiraltv, by which it wil be seen that the wrecks and casualties on the shores of the united kingdom wvere, in Wrecks. Loss of Life. 1853 ... 832 ... 639 154 ... 9S7 ... 1,549 showing an increase in the loss of ships, 155; and in the sacrifice of life, of 832 persons. " Your memDrialists, from the dangers always attending the navigation of the seas, from tenpests and those unforeseen calamities over which man has no control, do not expect from the hands of legislators any impossibilities - they pursue a danerous calling, and bow with submission to the acts of GorL, ut they humbly ask the intercession of Your Majesty ag-ainst their beng compelled to sail in an unrs worthy vesseL The law holds them to their agreement after havimg signed articles to serve in a ship, and in several recent instances crews of ships have been taken before a magistrate for refusing to go to sea in vessels in an unfit state to encounter the perils of the ocean, and sent to prison for periods from a month to three months, with hard labour, under the plea of disobedience of orders or desertion. The attempt to lay their grievances before one of Your MajesWs justices of peace has been construed into desertion; and several of the class to which your memorialists belong have, as we conceive, been most unjustly punished. "' Your memorialists, therefore, humbly pray that Your Most Gracious lajesty will use your high preropative, and shield then from the eMal-admistration o the'aw. That the law is unjust or corruptly administered your memorialists can prove by many reports of trials; but they will only cite one. In the latter end of Aril the brig Rachel was loaded for sea in the River Tyne. The vessel vas leaky, and. according to the judgment of the crewv, unfit to proceed on her voyage. The crew protested against going to sea in the vessel; but, under threat of 12 weeks' impniimsonent, they consented to leave port. Four days after the said brig foundered at sea from leakage, and the crew were saved with difficulty, having lost all their clothes and beddin. They applied to the Lords Committee of Privy C-o-nc' for Trade, to ascertain whether the Merchant Seanmen's Act gave them any remedy for the loss of their property. MIy Lords referred them to a conrt of common law. They carried their case to the Newcastle Assizes, and were non-suited on the 3d of Augast, thus establishing the fact that British seamen are compelled to sail in an unseaworthy vessel; and they have no redress at common law for any injury they may in consequence sustain. I' Your memoria3ists would further direct Your Majwes attention to a comparison of the law in iEngland and the Urnited States. William Robertson, a seaman, sumnmoned the master of the brig Active before the magistrates at Martlepool on the 15th of July. The master knoceld the said seaman down several times, shooLk him violently, dashed his head repeatedly against the windlass,-then ldcked him down the hatch, and it was onlyfromthe cry of 'Mrurder,' and the interference of the mate that in all probability his life was saved. After this brutal treatment, Robertson was landed at Christiansand for medical advice. Under bodily fear of the master he was frightened to make a complaint, lest he should be sent on board the ve_sel again. No questions were put to him by the British Consul, and the eonversation between 'the master and the consul -,as earried on in the Norwegian langange, not understood by the seaman. The wages due up to the period of discharge were paid, and the seaman left to find his way to England at his own expense. This case was dismissed b the justice of the peace, 3. P. Denton, Esq. (a shipowner),nfter consultation with the cerk of the court, also a shipowner. Had this case hap pened on board a vessel of the United States, the following consular laws would have been enforced - " Section 15. And be it 'further enacted, that no con. sul or commercial agent of the United States shall discharge any mariner, being a citizen of the United States, in a foreign port, wthout requi-ing the payment of the two nmontha' wages to which said mariner is entitled under the provons of the act of February 28, 1803, unless upon due investigation into the circumstances uder which the master and mariner have jointly-ppliedfor such discharge, and on a private examination of such mrainer by'the consul or. cormnercial agent, separate and apart from al offigers of the vessel, the consul or conmercil agent shall be satisfied thatit isforethe interestand welfareof such mariner tobe so discharged; nor shall any consul or commercial t dischargOe any marinier as aforesaid without requiring the full amount of *three mzonths' ages, as provided by the abovenamned act, unless under auch circumstances aswill, in lisa judgmnent, secure the United States from alll libility So expense on account of such mariner.

After recapitulating the facts of the ci the memorial runs as followvs:-"That your niemorialit are of opimonthat unaue baste wasusedin thetrialof JaI son, and that he had not suffieient time allowed bim fort purPOseofhisdefene,%24hoursonyinterveningfrombisbet crderedintocustodyandsentencee.ig p usseduponhiuLThat in all criminal cases the lawhas wisely, and withadue re. gara tD the rights adhet ftesbet rnddta depositions or a copy of the evidence wall be taken befo commitment, in order that prisoners may have a ful oppar tunity of meeting thecharge agaist them, and of hem properly defended.

Your memorialists Therefore pray that you will be pleased to directaninquiry into the circumnstances of the c5sej,nd recomnend lier jesty to rennt the sentence passed upon Jackson." Mr. Harvey, in moving the memorial, adverted to the great interest tbiju case had excited in tho rinds of the public, and said thi great organ cf the day, lte Time., had thought the matter: of sufficient importance to devote some space to it. It didt, seem to him that the treatment of Mr. Jackson had beerd most barbarous. Mr. Gatley said he believed that the man who had been thrust into prison .eith such undue haste and precitancy was not a guilty man 3Mr. Sissous said he would tell Mr. Overend (the presiding magistrate) that it was a disgrace -to any man to show such determined, such resolute, such grind injustice as he bad displayed in this matter. Aldern Dunn expressed his belief that Mr. Jackson was not morally, as he was sure he was not legally, guilty of the offence inmputed to him. He thought the only remedy for such cases asthis was tho appointment of a stipendiary-magistrate. (Cheers.) Mr. Beal sid Sheffield had obtained an unenviable noteriety in reference to this casc, the general belief being that Mr. Jackson was innocent, and that great inustice had been, done. He charged 3Ir. Overend with showsingaoias aainst the prisoner. Ho thought it was one of the most harsh and disraceful cases that had ever been brought before the town of Sheffielo; and- he was prepared to go with any one in a movement to remove Mr. ()verend fromn the commiss,ion of the peace. Mlr. Alcock said the town was disgraced b the decision in this case, and that the libertyof tle subject was jeopardized The conduct of Mr. Overend anderedit mperativeoupon them to takeimmediatestepsto put an end to such a state of things, and he fully concurred in the propriety of appointirng a stipeadiaryzuagistrate as a remedy for the p resent eviL. Mlr. Alderanm Hoole said that suchproceedmngs asthes cast a slur upon the adminstration of justice in quarter seasions, and if they were tolerated the public would lose all confidencein such courts. Mr. Brcadbent and3Ir. H Vicirers supportedithe motion in similar termns Mr. Alderman . . Hoole sait that at the next meeting he should bring forward a mnotion for the a pintment of a stipendiary magistrate for Sheffield. Mr. Alderman Tarton supnorted the magistrates, and said he had come prepared to introduce an amendment to Ms. Harqe's motion ; but, under al the circumstances. he would not subnmit it. The. motion for the adoption of the memorial was then put and carried with one dissentient Tnrton). A large meeting vas held at Leeds a few day o subect, being a convention of the paw3xbrokers of Yorkshire, when remolutions expressing the greatest indignation at the proceedings in this case and sYmpathy for Mr. Jackson and?hi family wero -I.nously passed.

MADAME JENNY LIND GOLDSCHMIDTS CONCERTS. Madame Goldschmidt gave her flist concert of miscellaneous secular music last night in the Hanover-square Rooms, which were crammed rather than crowded, although more than two-thirds of the seats were marked off as "reserved," at high prices. It is evident that this lady's attraction has not in the least abated; and on the whole, considering the indefinable charm attached to her performances, it is not to bewonderedat. Withoutbeing absolutely superior to other great singers, Madame Goldschmidt is unZike any other. This was felt when, as plain Jenny Lind, she first laid siege to the affections of the British public and carried them by storm; and, as it is quite as manifest now, it would seem she can no more be imitatedthan she can condescend to imitate. With its faults and beauties combined (and fanlts there are-of voice and style, of method and of mechauism), the idiosyncracy of JennyLind constitutes one of the most purely original and fasciatinginthehistoryofthevocalart. Thereisaromething engaging in whatever she does; the very defects of her voice have nothing unlovely in them, and even when, on the one hand, she exaggeratespoints, andon the otherfalls shortofthe expression suggested (both of which happen now and then), we feel more inclined to forgive than to chide-to sympathize than condemn. That an organization so peculiar, united to gifts so rare, should at times, even in defiance of reason, make its way to the hearts of audiences, no matter how cultivated, is not smrprising to those who have heard Jenny Lind often, although the fact, when recorded, may in some measure perplex future readers of her biography. The programme of last might's concert was varied iu such a manner as to display the talent of Madame Goldschmidt under several phases. She has, perhaps, not sung so uniformly well, and with such ustined effect, since her arrival here this winter. She nearly always begins quietly, not to say tamely, and is often nervous at the outset. On the present occasion, however, the piece selected for her first effort was one calculated to place her entirely at her ease-viz., the tranquil and beautifl prayer of Agatha, from the last act of Der Freisdztz, which shee delivered (in the original German) with a calmness and devotional serenity that were in admirable keepmng. Her next essay (in Italian)-the great scena from Beatrice di Tenda-recalled those exciting evenings at Hfer MajestWs Theatre when Mr. Lumley first iutroduced the Swedish songstressto thepublic, and the " Jenny Lind fever" was at its height. This was a brilliant and animated performance; and we thought we recognized, at the close of the first movement, just previous to the calaie# (M la sola"), a certain chromatic cadenzaa which, on more than one occasion, had captivatedthe ears of connoisseurs in 1847 and 1848, and which now, as then, without intending to detract anything from its cleverness, we considered at variance ith the character of Bellinis music. The third essay of Madame Goldschmidt was perhaps the most artisticaly finished, and certainly the most novel and extraordinary, of the whole concert. It was a selection of four mazurkas, y hopn, arranged for voice and pianoforte (to Italian words) y Herr Otto Goldschmidt, and developed in such a manner as to form a single morceaw. Of the vocal difficulties presented by these quaint effusions, which were written exclusively for the pianoforte, we shall say nothing, except that they were surmonnted with consummate ease. But in Chaopm's music, and more particularly in the mazurkas, there is a sort of dreamy restlessness (if we may so express ourselves) wedded to a vague sentiment of melanholy, difficult to describewhich consfitutestheircharand stam their individuality. Thiswasfeltandadmirabl- - rted bD Madame Goldschinidt, who kept the audience V by her singing until the last note, when their delght found vent in the loudest demonstrations, Nothingcoud be more delicate, or in better taste, than Herr Goldachmidt's accompaniment; the pianoforte was so sldlfully subdued that it was always weicome, and never obtrusive. The last two songs, however, created the most unfeigned enthusiasm. The fine old ballad of "John Anderson my Jo" was given with such simplicity and expression, and with so genuine a feeling of the poetry, that not to have been touched by it, and deeplytoucbed, would have argued something worse than insensibility. It was, indeed,, perfect. After anythmg so exquisite we could not take very great interest in the well-known Swedish "Echo song," which, though marveDous as a vocal display is, to our thinling, rather ventriloqusm than singing. ihe audience, nevertheless, were hardly of our opinion, since they applauded this more boisterously than anyhirg else in the concert. We have said so much of Madame Goldschmidt's singing that we can bestow but small space on the rest of the pro. Mamme, a large share of which was allotted to Herr Otto Idschxaidt's performances on the pianoforte. He played Beethoven's concerto in G, and Mendelssohn's Andante Tondo in B minor (with orchestral accompaniments), besides two movements (8olus) from J. S. Bach's Suite de .pieces in A minor. In the last (a samrtasade and allegro) he was eminently successful, and proved himself a dis' he of the right school. Of the rondo and concerto it would take too long to speak just now, though had we time we might find something to criticize in the first, and a great deal more in the last. It would not be fair, however, to decided upon the merits of so conscientious a player after a single hearing. Herr Reichardt contributed a chrming air from Mozart's Sraglio, and Raoul's first cavatina in the Huuenots (accompanied by Mr. H. Hill o'n the viola), both of which he sang with great refinement; and, to conclude, an excellent and numierous orchestr, led by Mr. Willy andAdmirably directed by Mr. Benedict, performed the overturberto Cherubini's Me6ea and-7fozsvrts Figaro - .the first aUl cleverness, the second all genius. fAvertisemuen~j ht everebodysa,Y must be true." -5ay c aPPUcia~ to books.

His Lordsbip a>- ived at Glocester at 11 o'lock, from his at near Stroud, and, accompanied by the BRev. . Emeris, the secretary of the schools, M, Pric, .P., Mx. Holn ., and othe gentlemen, visited the Ragged. Schools in a back street of the dty, where 160 children went through an examination before his Lordship. The pWy afterwards visited the Ragged School Faxra, on wlaich the ildren of t'he school are employed. At I oclockhis lordhp took his seat in the chair at the meeting atthse Shire-hall Among those present were-Mr. Price, MLP., Mr. Holland, M.P.; Mr. S. Bowly, Mr. J; Symons, Her Majests Inspector of Schools, The Secretaryhaving read a report on the subject of the school, showing that an increase of funds was greatly to be desired, to increaso itsusefulness, Lord J. RussE. addressed the meeting, and was listened to with the deepest attention. He said, he proposed to address a few observations to the meeting before they proceeded to the zeal business of the day. They had heard from the rev. secretary the state of the ragged school, and they knew that the general object of the school was to prov.de some education for those children whose parents were unable to send them to school, who could not afford the means of doing so, and who, if they, were not thus assisted wouldremain in the most laientable state of ignorance: The only danger which he saw-with regard to these schools ,was-not, certainly, that they would give too much education-the only danger which he could- see was that- classes would be admitted to the benefit of this gratuitous education who had the means of sending their children to schooL Now, he thought most of them would agree, aadexperienceshowed it, that where parents were enabled to send their children to school it was a duty incumbent upon them which they ought not to:neglect, and which they should have noexcuse for neglecting; and he would observe, too, that in this country men weres apt t value much more that which they paid for, and were thereby entitled to, than that which waS gratuitously afforded to them. (Cheers.) But he believed evrery care wras taken in these ragged schools-so called because those who receivred the benefit of them were not able to wear the ulsual dress of the community-thawt noneshould have the benefit of them but those who were otherwise unable to obtain education. If this were so, he thought there could be no further doubt on the subject that it must be a great benefit to the community that such schools should be established. Of late years more attention had been paid than formerly to these subjects as social qeuestions on which, first the happinmess of any locality; next, that of a large community; next, that of a whole nation ; and nex that of all mankind must depend. While they found that for centuries, from the period which they called thedark ages, through that period which they called the revival of letters, and now in the age which they called the age of civilization, on the one hand arts and sciences were very much improved, that manufactories had been establshed everywhere, that those who had command of a little money were enabled to obtain clotblng and furniture which mighthave been envied by the richest of the country three or four centuries ago, they found that by means of trade and commerce produce and manufactures were now carried from one country to another, and from the most remote parts of the globe, and articles of food and clothing were introduced, which furnished to the inhabitants of this country the means of comfort and enjoyment; they found science promoted, the arts encouraged and flourishing; they found besdes that, owing i the first place, to that revival of letters to which hehad alluded, and next to the great light of the Reformation, that the great traths of religon were circulated throughout the country. But in the midst of this age of civilization, and in a community which boasted of what it had attained, and wichwasproud, andjustlyproud, of what the labour, and the skill, and the ingenuity,, and the science of man had done-we found, in the midst of that community, in London, close by the dwellings of the noblest and the highest of the. land-in the cities where our great manufacturesfiourished, and in thetownssupUiedwithevery convenienceof life-thattherewerepersonsathelowestclass of society knowing nothing with regard to the commonest of these arts; in a country which traded with all the countries of the world, knowing nothing of geography, in a country boasting of its history and its constitution, kowig nothing of that history or that constitution ; but, more than all, in a country where the light of the Gospel was spread around, knowing nothing of the truths of religion (hear, hear), and to whom the name of God and of Christ was almost entirely unknown. If he wereto take up their time there would e no want of proof for the purpose of showing these things. Those who read the reports of the chaplains of gaols, of the inspectors of education, and of the various chasitable societies of the country must be painfully aware that what he said was abundantly proved by those documents. (Hear, bear.) The question, then, naturally arose, " oow does this come about ?" and there were and must be some in every populous community such as all the nations of Europe furnished who, owing to the competition of labour, sold the work of their limbs at so cheap a price, at so low a rate, that they could only affosd just sufficient food for their daily susteance. This muat be unfortunately the condition of a great portion of the community; but yhat can we do to eemedythisstateof thingr wy eould not prevent this competition; they could not say that if oneperson sold his labour for so much, another person, being on the brink of. starvation, should not offer his labour for something lower. Neither could society pretend to keep in z state of comfort all those classes, because such an attempt would only involve in one common ruin theprosperous and the industrious with the poor and needy. X~ot.ongago it was attempted by the Government of France to prvAde by laws, to be passed by every.nation on the earththat every class of commerce should produce a certain quantity of produce, and no more; that sO much of cotton goods, so much of woollengzod and so much of other manufactures should be produced, and that every country should enterintoaleague withlthosewbo called themselves the regenerators of mankind, in order to fix this arbitrary rule. There could be nothing more absurd, nothing more extravagant than this, and, benevolent as the intentions of those persons might have been, the absurdity and extravagance of the proposition were such that they ,were obliged to renounce their project. But if they were unable to do anything by which these classes could obtain greater means ind live m more comfort, they could take care to furnish the means by which their children could be instructed, bywhich theyshouldlearnthecommonthings of life, and obtain a fair elementary knowledge, and by which the influence of the truths of religion might reach their hearts (hear, hear) ; and when this was done, if the childrencouldstaylong enough at theschool, there would be reason to hope that they would be safficiently instructed to earn at least a laiger remuneration for their labour than, they could otherwise do; they would learn to have greatei foresight, not to spend their money extravagantly or intemperately, but, by the use of their faculties, to consider how they could improve their mental and bodily pwers, and that having learnt some trade, they would erin a better position than their parents before them. If they could accomplish these things, they would not have to lament that there existeda class of esons among them who were as barbarons, so far as knowledge was concerned, as those who lived in the dark ages, to whom Christianity was neverpreached, and to whom the arts were never imparted. (Cheers) Thiswas the means by which, among othermstitutions, this institution of ragged schools might improve society-not by any vague speculation-not by holding out any theory of the regeneration of mankind, but by plain, practical, patient, daily work-by that patient dally work which God had ordained to be our lot, and by which alone they might hope improvement would be effected. Cheer) His Lordship concuded by expressing a hope that the Glocester Industrial Ragged School would not be allowed to languish for want of support, and that, the seed having been sown, the public would so foster it that it might grow up inb a oodly plant. (Applause.) Mr. . P. PP;lCE, hI;P., moved the flrst resolution," That it is at once good public policy as rwell as a Christian duty to provide gratuitous instruction for those children who, from the poverty or demoralization of their parents, are precluded admnission into schools where payment is demanded." Mfr. HoAND, M.P., seconded the resolution, which was carried unanimously. Mr. SvaoNss, one of Her Maestys inspectors schools, then addressed the meeting, and produced some valuable statistics, showing the great neglect of education among the labou cLs. He moved the second resolution as follows:-That in the education of those children whose future support must depend upon manual labour it is essential to combine industrial sith intellectul training."' This was seconded by Mr. SAxuEL BowLi, and carried. The Rev. W. E. COGnsA- moved the next resolution"That this meeting, being assured of the success of the Glocester Industrial Rt=ged School during the three years of its existence, and of its rt capacity for further usefulness, heartily recommend it and similar institutions to public supprt;"t Mr. T. BL BAXR, of the Hardwicke Reformatory School, seconded this resolution, and, in supporting it, said he had had but little personal mnowledge of the school, having beenengaged in another work of a similar kind (the Hardwicke Reformatory), tos-which he had given himself up entirely, and to which he had devoted every hour he could spare, and pretty well as much money as he could spare Slso.(t Hear, hear," and cheers.)

Mfr. Bodkin and Mr. Clerk conducted the prosecution, and Mr. Parry and Mfr. Metcalfe were counaelfor the de-. fendant. Mr. BODE3N, in his address to the jury, said it devolved upon him to state the circumtances tinder which the preo. sent inquiiy was instituted, and when they saw that the defendaun;wore the uniform of the metropolitan police force, he. vwas sure they would agree with him that it was one ofvery. considerable pub]ic importance. It was hardly DeCessary for hiuna to remid them that during the summer of last year year very serious disturbances. took placF in Hyde Park and that vicnity in consequence of a bMl that ws introduced into Parliament -by Lord Robert Grosvenor, one of the members for that couty, having for its object the regulation of Sunday tading, and an alteration of the mode in which it had been carried on upon that day. -With respect to the wsdom or necessity of this measure they had nothing whatever to do, and that subject was wholly foreign to the present inquiry. There was no doubt, however, that it created a very great feeling of excitement, and that for several- Sundays there were large and tunmultuous assemblages of people in the Parlk, and that eventually the bil*as-withd aw3n It was, of course, the duty of the po7ice to but a sto _proceedis of the knd to which he referred, but, at the same time, they were bound to exercise- that duty with mildness and forbearance. He believed there could be no doubt that the meetings which took place latterly were of a very different character form the onginal ones, and that they degenerated into assemblages of persons whose object was undoubtedly to do mischief. This, of course, rendered the task of the Police more difficult, but in consequence of representations that were made that some members of the force had greatly exceeded their duty, and had exercised unnecessary.viulence in a et many instances, the Govern ment appointed a commisson, cornd of three most eminent persons-the Recorders of London, Manchester, and Liverpcol-to investigate the whole matter. That comnission sat forseveral days and examined witnesses, and they ultimately made a report; and, in consequence of thst report, the Secretary o State felt it his duty to order a pro. secution to be instituted against the defendant and two other persons. The learned counsel then stated briefly the facts he proposed to put in evidence, and he observed that there was no doubt that, as a body, the police force atpresent enjoyed the entire confidence of the public, but if any wanton violence or excess of duty were allowed to pass without notice, he said it would have a natural tendency to destroy that feelng. The following evidence was then adduced:- Mr. W. Stevens, the prosecutor, said,-I am a hairdresser and reside in Marylebone-street. - On Sunday, the 1st of July, a relative of my wife had come toour house totea, and I accompanied her to her residence in Park-street about 6 o'clock in the evening. After I had left her at home I went up Park-street in the direction of Oxford-street, and as I was going along I saw a cro*vd of persons near Grosvenor-street. here were about 300. They were near Lord Robert Grosvenor's house. I walked through the crowd, and all at once there was an outcry and a sort of a rush. I stood on one side to allow persons to pass, and I.observed 50Dor 50 policemen go by after the mob. I was standing at the edge of the kerbstone near Lord Robert Grosvenor's, and after thepeople had passed I was about. to move on, when I received a tremendous blow on the back. I tured round as well asI could, and said I was only a casual passer by, when I was struck in the mout±h-byu.policemanWs fist. I do not know who the man was that first struck me. There were several Policemen about. After Ireceivedtheblows on the mouth I had a succession o-bloas-from fists and truncheons, and I was at length struck down to the ground. Policeman 84 C was one of themen who struck me. I was struck with truncheons three times on the head, several times between the shoulders, and received blows at the bottom of the back and the lower part of the stomach. I believe that while I was on the ground I was kicked, and I was also beaten severely with truncheons, and the people about called " Shame ii I have no hesitation in saying the defendant is one of the men who assaulted me. (The witness said he was short-sighted, aud went close to the defendant to look at him before he spoke to his identity). I cannot say how many blows the defeDdant struclk, but 1 know that he hit me once mn the eye. I got up as well as I could, and went to some persons who were in a doorway for protection, but I was dragged back into the road by the police. I cannot recognize the persons who dragged me back. When I was in the road I was beaten again, and I became almost insensible, and all I can recollect is being placed in a cab and some persons accompanying me. Mfy coat was torn nearly topieces. Thebackwascompletelytornout. (Thecoat was produced and shown to the jury.) No one attempted to take me into custody, and no charge was made against me As soon as I recovered my sensesit littleI order the cabto be driven to Marylebonepolice-station,to mako a complaint I had a stickwith me, but I never used it or attempted-to do so. -I was- attended by a surgeon for ten weeks, in consequence of the injuries I receivedL My teeth were loosened y the first blowl received in the mouth. I stiUl suffer from ttle injuries inmy 3bl he Crossemxeline.-Park-street was not full, and there was room for the crowd topass without jostling me. The polce were following the people, and things wrere in that position when I was struck. I au say positively that the defendant strack me on the eye, but beEieve he struck me other blows. I was examined before the commission, and I-there spoko of having been assaulted by 84 C. I did also say that 1 had been assaulted by 80 C. I swear positively that I mentioned both the numbers. Mr. PARRY here proposed to ask the witness to look over the minutesof theevidencehegavebeforetheCommissioners, but the Court ruled that he was not at liberty to do so. Cross-examination continued.-I was asked whether I took down the number of any policeman, and I may have said that I believed I recognized 80 C, but I would not 3peak positively. To the best of my belief I never said that rdidnot thmk Icouldrecognize the man again. In all probability I may have said that I could not swear to either of the numbers, but from the first I made a charge against 80 and 84 C. Re-examined.-At the time of the examination I reconized 84 C, but I did not recognize 80 C. The defendant is 84 C, and I have no hesitation in saying that he is the man who assaulted me. William Hmphrey examined.-I am a boot-loser. I was in Hyde Park on the 1st of July and left about 10 minuts past 6 o'clock. I was going along Park. street and saw M.r. Stevens standing at the op osite side of the street, and I observed him move on one side to let the police pass him. I then saw a policeman rash at him and strike him with his staff on the lower part of the shoulders. I then saw the defendant strike the prosecutor on the eyes. He was then knocked down by other polcemen, and while he was on the ground he was struck by the police wth their truncheons, The policemen then seized him and dragged him up, and the back of his coat was torn out. I then took the numbers of the police, andI took one correctly, but was mistaken in the other. i am sure I am correct mn oe number, 84 C, and that the defendant is the man. I stopped near him while he ,wAs strikig the pr-ecutor and I am suroe he is the zma. I saw him dis. tinctly kick the prosecutor while he waslving on the ground. Mr. Stevens is an entire stranger to me. I first saw the defendant again when he appeared before the Commissioners I also saw 8O C, and I said directly that he'- s not the mian. Cross-examined.-I took the number (80) at '.-, time e.f the occurrence, and Ibeievo I was right in the r", ber, bDt notintheletter. Iput down "800," and I i; dthat i- was mistaklen. The moment I saw SOC I was satisfied hei was not one of the men, as I had seen him a great many times before. By the jury.-The defendant had the staff in one hand at the time le struck the prosecutor with his fist. William Nightingale, a carpenter, deposed that he was in Park-street at the time in question, and he saw a crowd near Lord Robert Grosvenor's house. He then detailed the partieulars connected with the assault upon the prosecutor in nearly the same terms as the former 'vitness. He also stated Positively that the defendant was one of the persons who assaulted the prosecutor. Some other evidence was adduced of a simiLar charcter, and this closed the case forthe prosecution. Mr. PARRY then proceeded to address the jury for the defendant. He said that, after the evidence that had been adduced, he should not attempt to deny that there had been an untustifiable excess of violence used towards the prose. cuter y some of the constables employed uPon the occasion, but he was instructed that he sho a b eto show that the witnesses were mistaken as to the identity of the defend. ant, and that he was not one of the menwhoassaultedthoproseutor, and that, in point of fact, he had nothing whatever to do with the transction. While he admitted that there. hiadbeen some unnecessaryviolenoe madeuseof bytbepoiice he could not help observing that, in 1848 when riot of a, murch more serious and alarming character took place in the metropolis, a goo delnore violence wsusdtowads many indiidal in the endeavour to repress them, and that the persons who sustainaed the injuries were afterward indicted and punished, and the 3olice were lauded to the skies for their sea-vices.

About S o'clock the reserre was sent-for. There were about 50 onsble. When they arived near I -1rd lobert Grosvenores boue yfoundt xarge crowd of :people, about Z%0O or 3,100. They were rhouting and ,throwInstones at the polioe. Witness was at the extreme ear of e by of resee, and Medgett, the defendant, was 5 his left side. Vitness was suck on the hat by a stone, and stones were lying zubut, -and some order was given and the men "broke out." At this time there was a, czy from the mob of "Down with the crushers! 'AJUaTI) A " cruher" was a nickame for a policemam The policemen broke out for the purpose of apprehending the people who were thro stones, and they proceededtoclear awLythe mnob. In about 10 minutes they were ordered bck to Stanhopegate. Xedgett was with him all the time, andlhe did not lose sight of him except for an instant, while they were tiulhmng round to go back. The defendant coold. not have een the man who amsulted the prosecutor. He Lad known the defendant for some time, and he alwaysoonsidered hint a quiet and inoffensive manL Cross-examined.-Witness had been two yrs in the force. He was in attendance at the Comnissioners', but was not examined. Witness's nunber was 30. The reserve of police ws close tolord lRobert G..svenor's house -Some persons might have been struck by the police, but he-did not see it. He saw nothing of Mr. Stevens. Ten or a dozen policemen, of whom witness was one, remained behind the main body. Heardno cries of "Shamer' anddid not seeany one onthe graond, or eee anyone taken awy m a cab. Was sure witness did not strike any one on that day either with his truncheonorhis fist. Re-exained-He was eight days in attendance before the Commnisioners, and was ready to give his evidenceif he had been called uipon to do so. There was no ehas.e 'aist Medgett at this thne, and he believed that he was ied as a witness. Richard James Holliday, another police-constable, 167 C, who w Also one of the body of reserve, said that he went with the other constables to Park-shteet, and they succeeded in clearing that street- during the whole time the defendant was close to hima, and he was sure that he did not commit any violence. If Le had done so he mnst have seen it, and he would swear positively that he did not cros the road and go up to a man and strike him. He had kno the defendant 12 months, and always consideredhima quiet, inoffensive man. There was no occaion to use any violence towards the mob, because they retreated before the police. Cross.examined.-Ue was quite sure that the whole body of the reserve kept together, and that one portion did not separate from the other. Abrluiun Hawkes; l44 C, another of the men Wo to the reserve, gave similar evidence, and he also ateit psitivelythathehad an f geeinethe defenKnt all the tiime he was mn Park-street, and that he oomuittedlno act of violence upon any one. Cross-examined-the mob were very violent, but they had not much trouble to clear the street. He did not draw his truncheon, but some of the other men did, and be saw no act of violence comitted by any one. He ws not cxamined before the Commissioners. By Mr. PARLny.-He acted according to the orders of his superior officers tbroughout the transaction. Elizabeth Bloxam said, shelived with heruncle in Georgestreet, Grosvenor.sQuare. She remembered the day in tcrowd had assembled in Park-stret, and sa w an act of violence committed upon Mir. Stevens by a policeman. - The defendant was nut the man who com:nutted the violence. She took the man's numberas 8O. She was examined before the Commissioners, and gave the ssme evidence she had to-day. It was a much older man than the defendant who assaulted the prosecutor. Dhe heard a gentleman on a balcony call out, "Take the numbers of those men," and she followed the men who had committed the assault, andsaw that he had large bushywbiskers, and was about 45 yoars old. By Mr. BonXiN.-She had never seen this man SinCe. Mr. Stevens was struck first by one poEceman, and then four or five others went up to hbu, and they all struck him with their truncheons, and after he was knocked down they continued to strike him with their truncheons. He tried to get ulp, bat appeared unble to do so. The prosecutor tried to get away, hrut the policemen follow ed him and kcnocked him down. A cab came u the street, andeveryonewbowas there must have reen it. A great many people cied " Shame I" She could not swvear to any of the man who were engaged in beating the prosecutor. tRe-eam ed.-She tol.d the polceman she had referred to that he ought to be hamed of himself for knockdng the man down as be had, and she bad got his number. Inspector Webb proved that he was on duty in Parkstreet, and in consequence of the violence of the mob he sent for the reserve from Stanhope-gate. The reserve was followed by a great crowd, The crowd retreated before the police. He saw the defendant standing opposite Lord Robert Grosvenor's house, and he did not see him strike any one. The defendant was a man of good temper, and mgdl and inoffensive In his habits. The mob was very exeited, and, in witness's opinion, if the reserve bad not come up at the time they did, all Lord Robert Grosvenor's windows would have been broken. There were a great many thieves in the crowd. Croa-extmined.-Ue saw no act of violence committed, but he saw one man with his head bleeding. It was not Mr. Stevens. The3manappeared tohimtobe aforeigner, andbe considered that he was exciting the mob, and ordered him to be removed. He s&w truncheons drawn, and saw them lifted up, but did noteeanyblows struck. He-would net swear that no blows were strauck but he did not see any. 31r. BOnDrs then replied. He said, it appeared to him that the ease for the prosecution had not been answered, and he could not help expressing his opinion that some of the witnesses that hadbeen called for the defence hadstated things whichttheymusthave known were not true. Time only witness whose evidence he considered was of the least importance was the girl Bloxam, and he reminded the jury that she confirmed the prosecutor in every respect as to tei brutal nature of the assault that was committed upon him, She did not profess to be able to identify all the parties, but, he said, the fact of her speaking positivel.y to one m;m, and to that man not being the prisoner, did not at all show that he was not one of the persons by whora the prosecutor was asaulted. 3r. Baron A31ARn, in his summing up, iai he had anticipated that it was possible some question As to the law upon the subject of riotQus and tumultuous assemblages would have arisen in the course of this inquhy, and be was quite prepared to have givn hs oinin pon tht point if it had occiured. appeared, howlever, to be admitted by the counsel forthe defendant that,, notwithstanding the charcer of the ase. blage of pceople which the police wrere called npon to die. perse, the assault tohat had been committed uponctprosecutor vs unjstifiable in poit of la, ndthe only question was as to the identity of the defendant, and whether he was one of the. ersons concerned in the act. The poEce were undoubtedly 3ustified in endeavouring to disperse the persons 'who were assembled on this occasion, but the law did not; authorize them to use any violence, unlessit was absolutely necessary; still less to make use of violence of such a dmarater as w as proved to have been made use of on this occasion; and he had no hesitation in telling them that every one of the policemen concerned in that violence was guilty of an offence against the law. The learned judge then re2ad over the whole of the evidence, and concluded by stating that it was for the jury to say whether, upon the facts before them, it was made out to their satisfaction that the defendant s guiltyof the offence charged aganst him. The jury, after deliberating a short time, said they were not satisfied with the evidence as to the defendant having actually commited any prticular asult upon the prosecutor, out they believed he was one of the constables who were eoncerned in the attack upon him. Mr. Baron MART3x said that this amounted to a verdiEct of Gauft, and that verdict was recorded, and the defendant was taken into custody. WTilim Gearin, another constable, was thenr3ma¶ea with assaulting and falsely imprisoning John James White. This case appeared to be a very different one indeed from the one just disposed of. The occurrence took place on the same day in Hyde Park, at the period when the crowd was very violenrt, and booting at the carriage Stones were flying in all directions, and it appeared that the defendant, who was on duty, vws struck by one, which appeared to come in a direction where the prosecutor was standing, and, he supposng it ws thrown by him, laidhold of him with the intention of taking him into custody. It -."'p1mcrd that the mob interfered and attempted to rescue ' ntor, and the policeman was knocked down anm j- 2w~~4Yinon, and he at length struck the prosecutor on ::n.xaination it appeared that the prosecutor was Z a potN i-the city, and there appeared to be very little doubt t tthe ad gone to theparkon thisday, not actuated by the most quet intentions, nd he admitted having hooted atthepolice. It appeared that he was eventuall tak;en into culstody, and charged at Marlborough-street writh having thrown a stoneat the constable, but the charg wa dimssed. Mr. PARMv was about to address the jury for the defence, but they intimated their opinion that it vwas -mneessyr he should do so, and they at once returnedaverdi*t of Afvo guilty. ' WilliamBewley, the third constble, wvs then ebaea ulpon an indictment, which contained twro cor ntk allegmn that he had assault ed-lliam Floyd and James Vassey. Inthis case, when aportion of the evidence hadbeengivenr> the trial was adojourned.
ADAUIffS2TPTIfE REFORM ASSOCIATION. I --A public, meeting, convened by the ianragers anid prin- alli suptarsof this cseoiationc, took place last night in th litarge %±of the 13ieV ltouse HoteL. The x~cedinp appeared to excite con.si rable interest. On it platform we observec4 Sir C. Napier. M.P., 21r. A. Pellatt, hi.lP., Mr. Morle;, the chairmanl of the ASsoeoiation; Messrs. J.

Mr. oerEitO haingtaken the chair,, opened the' x-occeedinigs by observing that the association assumtied that -it wvas the political and mnoral eighit of a tax-paying people to watchi the expenditure of the public monecy, and that these whio controlled that expenditure phould be men fitted bly ch'racer and ability for theo puiblic sen-ice. That do-, ..an was put forth by the A1dmninistrative Reform MAsoelation OnL behalf of the people of England, andl few wouldl dissent from its justice. Thin wars no caere party or class mnovemientb. They attacked no existing right, no peculiar -orer,andhadno ere political end to serve. If the larger porton f teirmemershappned to he what were termed 'Lier'.," ha ws n fault of the association. Every pa3rtouh to be interested in the purity of the public servicean the.maint-enance of a good systen of government, 3mel a,s fa s osble to endeavour to secuire that the public s;ervice shudb onducted with a capability commensurate witle th liopeur and interest of a great nation. (Hear.) lit his opinion, there were not many political questionsworth fighting for At the present mnoment lint there werencany social, mnoral; educational, econtoneica'l, and sanitary measuires of refereesi to' secure, and if by a concentration of eneg thecy could accomplishi suich reformis they wvould arrive ut the enid Prjo pred by tlat as~sociation. Their platform was slot keitendd for the mere display of personal grievance, although, isoecses, a personal grievance mnight swell to tedmnIons of a national injury; it was niot erected for the exhibition of anyvs r buit for the speial purpose of malking it imposbi thatL theore should ho any political mlartyr~domi at all in future. (Cheers) Their efforts were directed to the sweeping away of impediments to fair and openpcomptition betweewn rserit and demerit, ability and dulnes~s, experience anti ignorance-to put an end to a system of ecuiveness which pressed down administrative talent andpermitted incapacity, through thie patronag o part -, to torr public ofices. (Hear, hear.) Instead of makilng situations for men, why did they not put the very best nieeu into them wihen thley becane vacant? Because of Ule existence of prty governmient and Parliamentary cornhlition. (Hear, hear.) When tlie Prince Minister wished to secure the most efficient man for the public service hce was obliged to hiamper himself w~ith the inefficiency of twvo others, for lie wa%s freqaoently comipelled t-o find some minor offices to pla~ce at theo disposa of Inis Parliamentary supporters, in order that their conniexions mih fill them. If those offices were filled 'with einen of talent the systemi, thoughi had, would be bearable; buit the test of public appointments was not Etness, huit jinfiuence,-not mierit, hut patronage, and the results had be-en most disastrous; Why wNas it tint nio complaints we-re made of theo appointment *of our judges, but that on thee contrary such general satisfaction was always gsiven? Because theo Government couit make no mistake? Heese mieni, in the first p lace, were rot' chosen on account of faimily influaence or Ministerial *patronage. Neither the one nior the other could make a succe-ssful lawyer, and, in thee niext place, theo public, whose initerests were concerned, would niot entruist their cases to an inecomupetent pleader at the bar. Jiust so in other matters; if it weLre k-nowin that fitness alone wvas to ho thee test for the putblic sen-ice, multitudes would always be labouring to prepare themselves for s-ucb appointmuents. The Adnunistr-ative Refora Association lead striven to inculcate the idea that thiis natibn coeeld afford to liension any aneiount of ineSpacity, buit could not aford to maintain heeiptenCY in 'office, and thzat it was the best economay to have ethirlworkdone by good.men at a fair rate of remunerattion.

For much of this the peop)le were themselves to blame; thieywereconxtimeayly writing o their miembers; for appointments for members of' tHecir owni families, andl the case of the Association would bee all the stronger if the people were willing to get into time public sex-vice by front, and net by back doors.

Among other things that the attention of the AdminListrative ReformiAssociation~ hiad been turned to was the reeit fall of KEars, and he had m o hesitation in saying that if the statemnents wrere proved whiiclhad been made in thee inquiry that had taken place, med theneglect which had led to the sufferingand finLal eapi- ticatien ot the garrison were traced to our Governmnent,I inepeaclinent would be too mild a treatment of the -guiltypar- tis The atrocitylhad been enormous.

That principle hiad been conceded to a certain e-xtent ; but still nomnination eremained, and therefore the same family influence and patronage. The mere knowledge tbat anybody could obtain a publie appointmnent who had fitted himself for it would promcote education more than all the acts of Parliament that could be passed.

Few,'he said, were so old administrative reformers as himself, for he had noted the necessity for reform in the army when amere boy, and as he had grown up he became more and more strengthened in the conviction that reform in most of our departments was required. After refer,Sirg to some of the errors of former wars, especially of the Coreznissariat Department, he observed that at the present - ment a smell sream divided the allied army and that of their enemy, and it was by no means probable either that we should cross over to tem or that they woild attack us. 'he only tming we could do vould be to embark and land at another pLace in order to attack them. It w-as impossible for that army to remain idle, but it was more than probable that if they attempted to make such a ma?iesvre the Russians would olve them a two mouth'? trot.

They 'had laid down a bar at the entrance to Cronstadt vwithout tlo range of hostile shot; this had been dono during the preent year. There was then only four feet of water onit, and helhad no doubt that by the time the campaign was opened it would be much stronger, so that. there is everi probability that our vessels would pay anotlier visit to the alt ic and come back again vithout doing anything. Then the admirals would get blamed like ho was but he would not take the blame. (Cheers.) He wanted it put on the right shoulders. Saddle the right horse vth it- He said that tle country were bound to make an'inestigation into the naval campaipns of 1854 and 1835 in the Baltic, and if the admirals had not done their duty let them cither be shot or disgraced..

THE MBETEOR. The Courrier dci Havre of the 8tll in3t. has the following " Yesterday, at a fev iinutes before 5 o'clock, a long train of fire, taking, by its undulations, the form of a serpent, wrs visible mn the heavens, which it lit up the more vividly as daylight was5 on the wane. This track of fire took a direction from north-vest to soulth-east, and at the monment its head, which had the appearanco of a ball of fire of the diameter of a shell of about 10 inches, appeared to approach the ground, a loud explosion was heard, and for nearly 23 minutes a pale light spread over the atmosphere, accompanied by a transparent and light smoke, which gradually disappeared without any sulphurous smell reachinig the persons best placed to observe this beautiful meteorological phenomenon. * "We have questioned a namber of peroons'who, like ourselves, witnessed this apparition, and all of them fancied they .saw theglobe of fire fall at a short distance from the spot wfhere they stood. One of our friends w-ho was retm-ning from Cape do la Heve assures us that the explosion took place far out at sea, and this version is corroborated by other testimony from persons whose occupation had led them to the seashore. "If an asrolite fell from the meteor after its explosion, it will be very difficult, we think-, to ascertain where it fell. Some idea may be formed of the elevation at w-hich it appeared from the fact that it was seen at Ronen at the same hour as at our town.''J The Jour-nal de RoBucn of the 8th of January thus describes the apparition:- " A most rare meteorological phenomenon appeared in the atmosphere of onr town about 5 o'clock yesterday evening. At that hour a globe of fire about the size of a man's head appeared darting along at great speed in a direetion from north-rwest to south-east, when it was seen to fall. It wsm especially observed that in its passage through the heavens thle globe in 9nestion shot out sp. rks of fire w>hich formed a luminous tall, wfhich did not disappear for at least 20 minutes after the principal body of the meteor. The curious electrical phenomenon which we have just described aswitnessed oncebefore, it will be remembered, at Ronen, some years since, on a suammer's evenine."
THE EXTRAORDINARY Al,11OSPHERIC PHENIO- MENON AT SOUTHAMPTON. I 'V TUTE JEDITOR OF TEIE TIMES.

It may be interesting to some of yotur readers to know the same thing was seen here. On Monday atfternoon some friendts and myself were retunig on horseback towards Neath froni a northerly direction, when, at seven minutes to 5 (I think- may watch was rauter fast), our attention was directed to a ball of fire which seemed descendling towards the earth in the vall1ey close b?y. The sky was quite cloudless; the fire ball appeared to increase in size as it neared the earth, and to change its colour to a greenishi hue; after its descent a beautiful cloud of light floated in the air towards the north for a considerable time. One of my workmen and the turnpike-man at the SNwansea-gate, who saw this also, felt convinced the ball of fire fell in the valley close by. The distance betwveen this and Southampton, in a directlie, 'is about 12 miiles. I am. Sir. vonrt ie.. W. BULLOCK WEBSTER. k-uvu--asue, x, earil, oouLa ky nies, )an. LU.
LORD ADoSnrus FnzoCrnEscE.-We regret to learn that the favourable change which gave hopes of Lord Adolphus Fitzclarence recoverng from his very serious illness has not continued. On Wednesday the noble and gallant invalid was pronounced to be not so well as on the preceding day. Yesterday Dr. Bright and the otTier maedical gentlemen in attendance on his Lordship had a consultation after seeing their patient, and at the close of their deliberation the following buUetin was issued for the information of the numerous inquiring friends of his Lordship:-"Lord Adolphus Fitzclarenee has passed a restless night, but has had several hours' refreshing sleep this morning, and was in all respects as weU as yeaterday-2 o'clock, p.m., Jan. 10." Her Majesty and his Royal Highness Pince Albert sent by telegraph yesterday morning from Windsor Castle to learn the stateof his tordship. At halfpast 10 last night Dr. Bright and his Lordship's other mnedical advisers met at Lord Adolphns's residence at St. James's Palace, and another consultation was held. The result of the conference is conveyed in the annexed buUetin :-" Lord Adolphus Fitzelarence has passed a more comfortable day, and,is better this evening than he was at the same hour yesterday.-10 30 p.m., Jan. 10." TaE Nx PREsiDsNmA QunrE oN.-The great question to be decided by the people at the next Presidential election is not simply who of many candidates shaU be the chief magistrate of this nation the next four years, but shaU the Union longer exist ? This of courso wiUl not be voted on " Yea" and "Nay" directly, buttthe determination of a large and powerful party to bring the slavery question into thecanvass,andmaketheissuedirect betweenthefriends and enemies of that institution, involves the great and momentous question of the existence of the federal llnion. The enemies of the South and its institutions have fully resolved to bring the people to a position where they wiU be compelled to say, by their votes,- whether they are in favour of restricting slavery to its present limits, and by so doing crush it out and destroy it ; or leave it to go wherever the people choose to take it. In other words, whether they are in favour of the British or American policy for the tropics. The question will be presented in this form-of opposition to the extension; and is slavery an evil? and the people will be compelled to say, by their votes, whether or not they believe slavery wrong, unjust, and craeL To this point it must come, and the sooner it is brought to it the better. Here we are willing to meet it, and here the Democratic party have resolved to meet it. There mnust be no more halfway stopping places-no more acknowledgments that it is an evil-but the South isresponsible for it, and we of of the North may shut up our eyes and fold our arms and say we have nothing to do with it. But we must come square up to the line, and declare openly and boldly and frankly that slavery is not only not an evil, but a necessity to the advancement of progress and civilization in the tropical regions; that it is the natural or normal, and, therefore, the best condition for the African race, and must be continued and spread over the now uncultivated'and semi-barbarian regions of the South. Formore than 50 years good men of the North and South have been in the constant habit of acknowleding that slavery is an evil and a curse, and have sought and wished and prayed for its extinguishment. Various plans have been devised and pursued to rid the conntry of this long acknowledged evil, yet every one has proved futile and the more the wise, and good and learned men of the land have examined the subject, the more obstacles and difficulties do they diseover in the way of its abolishment. It is so interwoven with the business of the whole country, so interlocked with the trade and commerce of the- States, and so closely connected and inocuLated wvith all the domestic and family relations of the entire South, that its abolishment is as imposible as to sever, by legislateenactment, the parental tes of parents and children, or the affection of kin and kired. This utter impossibility of abolishimg slavery in the States has ledmen to reflect and ask themselves-" How is this? Howisit that this great, happy, and pro rous nation cannot remove from itsmidst so great an evil as slavery! How happens it tlatarpeople, blessedof Heaven,andenjoyingmoreof thebounties of theearth, of freedom, andcof equal rights, than anyotler that ever existed, can exist and progress with this evil-this great, this momentous eviL gnawng at its very heart? There must be some mistake here- itis either not the evil we have been in the habit of thinking it, or this country is not happy and prosperous, The two things cannot go together." But the country is happy and prosperons, though interested and wickced partisans have long misrepresented that portion of it where slavery exists. Being poperous and happy and powerful, it can~ remove every evil institution writhin its borders;* but to remove slavery wou!d ne the destruction of half the Union. What, then, is to be done? Why, either prove that slavery is not an evil, or destroy half the Union at once. The fact that it would be necesiary to destroy half this Union to abolish slavery is of itself evidence that slavery is not an eviL-New York WTte6eky Day-Book. TarE- CASE OF.

bAVIYAUXW IF UAGMES BY THE ANASTATIC ZPOCESS. rAdvreisemtA1 TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES. Sir,-In your widely circulated journal several letters nave lately appeared, bearing upon the assumned applicaoility of the Anastatic process to tho purposes of the forger. We tlinmk it much to be regretted that the subject has acquired such prominence, for two reasons-fist, because the Patent green paper, which is said to be the only security against such frauds, is quite unfit for banknotes, as its colour and want of durability sufficiently testify; and, secondly, because the paper itself may be subjected to a process, after printing, which randers its assumed security iUusory. Our object in troubling you, however, is to state that at the time (some years since) when the lectures at the Polytechnic Institution attracted so much attention to the subject, and the lecturer (Mr. Appel) publicly asserted his powers to imitate aU copxrrplate as weU as surface engraving, we made four sevrsil applications to him to imitate our notes and other work, and on the last two occasions we offered to employ himn professionally, and to pay him any smm, not actually exoibitant, if he wvould do his best to imitate it, whether he succeeded or not. Mr. A pel aclnowledged the fairness of the offer, and professed his willingness to undertake it if his partner (Captain Glynn) woul(dconsent; but, aftervarions excuses and delays, we failed in procuring any attention from him, and were comneUed to institute experiments for ourselves, the result of which vras, a conviction that any banknote, with a reasonable amount of good engine-turned and other work upon it, was secure from forgery by Anastatic mcans, and that any note might be made so by a simple process. Mr. Rogers asscrt that the n unerous mnethodiwhich,xave been adopted since the invention of the anti-Ahastatic paper merely occasion, in some cases, difficult;es in, buit'do not stop reproduction. In reply to this, and for the assurance of the banking Public, who have been most unnecessarilv alarmed in thisEmatter, we again offerto furnish MIr. Appel, oranyone clse he may name, with a specimein of abanker's note, and of a check, such .s are in constant circulation, and if be wil snccessfully imitate ther.o, within anv reasonrble time, in the presenceof some zertieman of undonbted resiectaNility, whsbhall be entirelv unconnected with any of the partids, and shall ptut his name, as we will ours, t-o thei bettomn of the award. we ill pav all the expenses, ijucludirat his ewn services, if he suceceds, anid all but those, if he fals. We have avoided the luestion of the Bank et F.nglayid note, not because we doubt Mr. Arpel's statement that he has imitated it, but because it is the result of sarface praint ing, and not coperplate; and under the Patent for AI:zstatie printing, Which was taken out in 1844, andl fully describod and illustrated in the numbers of the A -,- j'io7n for January and February, 1845, the same would eaily lhove been done shad the note then. been in existence; hut it icc a very recent act of the Bank to reduce what little secinity they had for the Protection of tie public in order to ccono mire in their expenditure.
