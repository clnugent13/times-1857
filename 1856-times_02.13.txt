The :UoD CRINTMLLo laving quitted the woosa6c, Lord RZDESfA!rS as Chairman of Committeesi took his seit at the tabte. Lord LYNDHMtST then rose and said,-My lords, I ws wked lasi eveningl my noble and lemedtiend, and by a nableOrl, wh ttmurso I intendedi to.Tmse in moving for thisc emittee. t declined thentto eArs those ques. tions, V*muse I thorgit it might k*i -to 'necessary dis£uwsiors, and, -,ls, because I dswrgt it quite obvious to alUeparsons wlse had paid amy 4tezitioa to the precedtats ef tinlar proceedigs, that ere was only ene 'course 'C.ch could osMy ;be pursued.

The course, therefore, -which I am now about to pur-sue is to Iprove and establish the facts widE I 'then stated, and to call to your lordshipse bar witmesses to produce the records referred to in support of that *xgament; and I ihsll further request that the records, or thocenecessary,forthe elucidation of the subject, 'be laid eon the t-able of the house, and that they be transated and priSted for thte se of members of this cosmnittee -and of The ethertiHousoof'arlinent. Myhlords, I have further o state,asfar as 'relatespersonallytomyself, it is a lite hard 'upon 'me, sitting for many years in your lordshis bousS that the tbour of searchiag into detuls sould fal 2uen moyself (hear}; I think it is particularly hard 'Shen I consider-that tbe nohle and learned lord opposite has a host of- ens-I do not like to give them the dedgna. tion'whictihey usually bear in the profession (a laugh, 'but I will call them myrmidons-employed for the purpose of thiskiad,whocould have saved me alithe labourof detail necessary for the elucidation of the subject. Havinz saidthisI, I shill call a gentleman from the Tower, who wih l psoduce soaei of the records. Lord'CAVPBELL, before his noble and Iearned friend called any witness, submitted.to their lordshipe, tit, according to principle and custom, notice should be given to his niht hou:friend the claimant under this patent, who had oa nndouibted right to be heard. According to precedent in the BraAdoen case, notice should be given to his right hon. friend,'that he might appear by his counseL He was anxious their lor-dships should not suppose that they were to proceed iithout giving to that right hon. person the right to be Lieasd, but upon inquiry he found that a motion that his rght hon. friend should he heard must she made in the Hroue, and not in committee. When their lordships resumed.t¢erefore, he would make that motion, that the right hon. cLaimant might appear by himself or by his counseL LordLYNDELURST.-I ought'tohave added, that I shall produce extracts from the journals to satisfv your lordships that the course which I am no w about to pursue is the correct' one-a course quite consistent and in accordance with Parliamentary usage from the earliest time. Earl GRANVILE wished to know to what tition cf the right hon. claimant the noble and learned lord referred? lord CAPBEIL explained that he had not noticed any Ietition in this instance. He had said that his noble and learned friend ought undoubtedly to be communicated -with. He had sat for 30 years, with the judges, as a judge i2on the woolsack, and he ought to be permitted to sit on the woolsack, and speak from thewoolsackwhen he appeared kere to assrt his claSmL I=od St. LEONARDYS said, it ws quite right that his noble and learned friend should be heard. He did not riseto objecto o the motion which his noble and learned friend (LorCampbell)proposed to make, but he wished to call attentito o what had tZken pLace in the Brandon cae. In that case counsel were heard at the bar for three parties-namely, 78r the claimant, for the Crown, and for the House. The Crown, in this instance, was furtheing the clam of the claimant, and the House was resting it, so that the cLaim was not watched in the ordin3ry way,on-the part of the Crown, by theAttorney-Ceneral, to see thsat~no improper person obtained a seat in their lordaias' house. Lord CAIPBELL said, that would be matter for ftur consideration; but, on the fairest principle, the claimant tught to be-heard. Lord R}EDESDALE then put the q=estion, that the Keep,er of the Records of theTower be called to the bar; wMiCh lVaS agreed to. On the motion of the Earl of DERY, it was ordered that lord Lyndhurst do examine the witnesses, sitting. (Cheers.) Mr. EL G. Sharpe, assistant-keeper Rolls' Chapel, then appeared at their lordships' bar. Lord £IYlND EUST.-Do you produce the patent of Guichard d'Agle, ho was created Earl of Huntfigdon in the 1st of Mlichard II. Witness.-I do. Lord LZNHURST.-Will you have the goodness to read it-I mean that portion of it which relates to the limitation of the title ? The.witness then began to read from the original record, but, finding some diliclty in doing so, he observed that the parchment was stained and that the light was very bad. Lord LYNDHURST.'-Has not this been printed? Witness.--It hasm Iord LY} EPHURST.-WiU you read it from the print? I The witness then proceeded to read the Latin record, wlhch recited the style and dignity of the Earl of Huntingdon, and deelared that it was conferred upon him totd trit eud dur-ante. Lord BROUGHA3.-When was it dated ? Witness.-In the 1st of the reign of Richard II. ILord St. LEOKNADRS presaumed that the whole of the documents and.extracts would be printed for the ymse of both Houses of Parliament? Witness-The whole of the documents have been printed. Lord St. IEGNAR'YS was aware of -what the witness hMa 6tted ; but, -unless they were printed expressly for the mseof the two Wouses, noble lords would have to go and zansack the lihbrary for them. Lord LYDIHUEST.-I now cal1 upon the witness to produce a xecord dxted the 9th of December, in the reign of 1cichard U., oreatipg Robert De Vere, Earl of Oxford, M%rqnis of Dublin,andDuke of Ireland. Mr. Shiareproduced the patent and proceeded to read it, but with ich rpidity-and in so indistinct a tone of voice TMe Earl of ELLEITBOROUGH observed, that if the vitnes -were reading English their lordships could not understand him, but, as he was reading latin he should read rlowlyhnd clearly, that their lordships might be able to Leax and sndexstand.himr too. The LfORD HAUNCELLOR said, that those noble lords who were in the habit of attending Committees of FriviI¶ knew that -amilness -Ofo produced records was never he ed upon oreadethemo, butm erely tob and them in. In this Instan a hitwes a waste of time, as they were already aicearible -W otheirIordships. %He did trast the committee would feel that this WaS3, OxItter which ought to be pro. ceeded with wih. ,he -utmost rapadity.

Afterz'he esidcune which had bee taken, he was as much at a Ic s to know what ourse was to be taken as he vvwas when the c. te,e fist met, At the same time he had no wish to opl,'We th4 adjourniaent. The Ead of EIdENEOROTOR mnderstood that *. Iif evidence which had been given-a the bir was for the p- pose of placing before theLr lordshs'S facts on which theT wvere to proceed; and it was impossb6 to Co on until they' had read those facts. I - * EarI GREY said that evidence hadbeen called to prove.} facts which were admitted on both xides, and which no man had ever doubted or disputed. HaYing occupied themselves for an hour in proving that which every one knew. they were now to adjorn for a week, to prove additional facts with which every one was eq1iL' fmilar. What they wanted was some clear and iedmte issue brought before themn. -If their lordahips wre prepared to vote th' t the atent tws illegal let thera give notice to that effect but et them not continue the prreit form of proceeding, which te ws som ,to saJ pad degememd iato sopetbing not very tive should remain in albuyance 41 the times-R might be for the whole session. Lord CAMPBELL had crainaWy Unbrstood the -noble earl to say that no attem-i would be tiade to procure the admission of the noble ,,on until tie Committee of Privileges had come to a dcSAn. Lord ST. IEO~pra,DS ;ot not help rising to speak upon the very im 'btVestion raised by his noble and learned frieivj tlsthe ird ancellor). His noble and learned fried insiLi eduprehamt if the Crown issued a patent, as is this case, tonfized.toiafkje dignity, and acoompanied by tlhe usua wiit Ag <unmmts,-upon that patent (however invalid it iflIgt be) bel.g brought to the table of the House a^ndread, their T'lhhiEMs could not refuse to reoeive the noblepersan.produding it, because he hsd reoeived- wTit of sumons *4rornlie Crown, and had a riRht to aseat ia virtue of ebatW tof smons. NSow, let their lordehips consider eYr 'a 'tnoment the difference between .n o2dinary writ of -siamyis unaccorapanied by x patent, and a writ of su, nons fo'nded upon a patent. If the wit of smmons weregenerdi, their lordships knew, fromn what was the case intkceaaiiert periods of our history, what ttie effect was - [ namely, thr.tthenobloperson whobroughtit came here and !sat byviHae of it, without a single word about descendible qualities: and that it at once gwave him a seat in the senate, [ st the.ie time ennobling his bloodtotbeextent ofhis lineal heirs. iBnt. how w as this consistent withthe case of theuresent clcunant, who camne here with a patent conferring oalya life,estate? The noble baron would tell -them that the ast thiaO he would wish for wiould be to claim an hereditary dignty. But in the way in which his noble and learned . friend put it, the writ would imply in itself an hereditary dignity conferred by the Crowvn, and the result wouldi bethat after the learned baronhad taken hia seat the dignity, in case of his death, would descend to his daughters. Bnt the Crzown in these davs was not in the habit of grautinga patent' extending to females. So much did the practice incline the other way that, in point of fact, atl Patents were now confined to heirs male. Nothing could be more clear to his rniindthan the distinction he had drawn, and he apprehended that there never was a greater fallacy than that uttered by his noble and learned friend when heconfounned the one case with the other. He was perfectly certain that if the noble baron came there with any otherpatent than one I making the dignity descendible to his heirs male the opi- nion of the House musb be taken upon the subject. Independently of the principle involved, there was the Brandon case to guide their lordships, in which the House, after a long debate, conducted in the presence of the Queen, decided in the negative upon the right of the claimant to sit as a British peer upon the patent granted to him. That noble person did not take his seat, and he apprehended, therefore, that precedent was directly opposed to the right now claimed. Earl GREY thought their lordsbips' course of proceeding was becoming very ireular and very inconvenient. The noble and learned lord (Lyndhurst) had moved that a witness should be examined, and in the middle of his evidence there bad aisen a debate upon the most difficult points on which they were ultimately to decide, while at the same time they were in possession of no information, and had no questionbefore them. He was sure it had been the object of their lordsbips to expedite this business az far as possible, and therefore, instead of bringing the committee together to hear a quantity of law Latin, with which persons must be more f-amiliar than he was if they could follow it, he would su gest whether, as the documents now being read at the bar had all been prnted by pubEc authority, and were formally in possesssion of the House, their lordships would not do well to appoint some learned person to assist the noble and learned lIrd (Lyndhurst) in examining these documents. Such extracts as he nmght consider desirable would then be printed and laid before the House, and then let the noble and leaned lord move some distinct resolution upon them, and call upon the committee to decide the question. (Hear, hear.) He had never (as their lordships knew) Ieen very sanguine of the success of the course of proceeding now being adopted, but if the suggestion he made were acted upon they might possibly arrive at some conclusion. Lord BROUGUAI joined the noble earl in regretting that they had been drawn into this irregular argument-an argument very important, but altogether premature. He a p proved the, sugUestion made by the noble earl that for the purpose of facilitating their proceedings, as well as makingthem more useful and more speedy, his noble and learned friend should have the assistance of competent imersons in selecting and presenting these documents. Itwvas perfectly well known that there were several individuals who were expert in inquiriesrelative to what was called peerage law, and their aid might be conveniently and profitably called in on the present occasion. Lord LYNDIHURST said, the document in the hands of the witness might have been read 20 times over while this discussion had been going on. He wished to know whether the Lord Chancellor approved the suggestion just made ? The LORD CEANCELLOR said that it was for the committee to sanction the course proposed, but he, on his' part, would not offer any objection to it. Iord BROUGIA31 wouldsuggestto his noble and learnedI friend to move that Mr. Eleming be associated with him to assst him in the performance of the task which he had undertaken. Lord LYNDHURST said that, having undertaken the duty which he had, he was wiling to carry it out, but he thought that some of his noble and learned friends in that house ought to be associated with him. After some further conversation, it was agreed that the documents from the Tower, referring to the patents of life peerages, should be handed in by the witness without being read, in order that they ;night afterwards be printed, translated, and exctended for the information of their lordsu,adthe following documents were banded in accord- " igot.

VI., creating Sir Johin Cornwall Baron Eannhope and Baron Milbroke."g In reply to Lord BROUGSUA, The witness stated that he bad not been directed to institute any further search than into the period to which the documents which he had handed in referred; but he believed that by Mlonday next it would be possible to inquire into the documents at the Rolls Chapel, which referred to peerage patents for life since the time of Edward IV. The LORD CHANCELLOR did not see the necessity of the documents being translated, but he wished to know how soon the papers would be prepared? The witness said, he believed by Monday next. Lord LYNDEURST said that he wished to have some of his noble and learned friends associated with him in conducting the inquiry, and also to have the assistance of some learned gentleman who was acquainted with the detail of mquines of that character. ILords BROUGHAM and CAMfPBELL expressed their wMillmgness to render every assistance to their noble and learned friend, and more especially with the view of expe. diting the progress of the inquiry. The Earl of DERBY said that the noble and learned Lord Chancellor relied upon certain precedents in support of his view of the case, andit would, he thought, tend to expedite the inquiry if that noble and learned lord would move for the production of those papers upon which he relied. The LORD CHALTCELLOR had no papers to move for, inasmuch as therecedents upon vhich he relied were in the volume yled printed. Lord LYNDHURST admitted the desirability of expeditimg the inquirg as much as possible but said that, in a question of this importance, their lordfil s were bound to take every step that was necessary to euable them to arrive at a right conclusion. They were not to put in comparison with an important constitutional question of this kind the personal convenience of a particular individual, however respectable. He was sure that their lordships would concur with hm that, whatever time might be necessary to thoroughly investgate the subject. would be properly employed in commig to a right conclusion upon it. Lord BRIOIJGHA3f agreed in wishing to expedite the inquiry; hut warned their lordships against showing " more baste than isood s;neeji" Lord LyNTDURST.-I think that the best thing we can do now is to adjourn to Monday next, at 2 o'clock. Lord CAMPB=LL gave notice that he should move in the House that his right hon. friend should be heard before the conmittee byhiniseif or counseL The LORD CHACELLOR.-If such a motion be made and carried, my noble and learned friend wvll respectfully decline totake any art in the proceedigs. He considers, as I coasider, tlat the whole queeion is eoram rnor judie Without intendlng anydisrespect to this ouse, he means to claim hIs sightof admission by virtue of his patent, or by his wvrit alone. As he intends to take that course, so does he intend, rsspectfull!, to decline jurisdiction of this comnittee. eU asi mever had any intih=ton that the matter has been referred by Hxr Majesty to the House, and until he shaU receive such intiation he will ao recognize the right of the House to interf£e. Lord CA3PBELL.-That may be a veruomerdeclaxationfor the noble and leamned lord to make -ti 'b is no reason why we should act irregulasy-* and I dalt hierefore make the motion of which I have givez notice. far from ridiculous. He vsubiitted, if the committee were to be of any use, that t ose who had asked the House to go into it were bound t,o advise the House as to the course which it ought to adopt; and the ordinary plan 'would ba to iovc a resoluslon on the subject. The Earl of DERBY observed that the estion before the committee was perfectly clear; it W the validity of a pwtent purcortirng t convey to a commoner the right of stig int ei rdahips' house, that patent being only for life. ite remoinded the noble earl (Grey) that the house was now called won to proceed in a judicial capacity, and that they were wsot at lhberty to take notice of matters of notoriety, but were bound to have the endence legally before them. EI it should result from that enidence that there was ino recedent in existence for the step which had been taken in tepresentcase he thought that it would go far to leadate committee to come to the conclusion that the reoast exercise of prerogative was, to say the least of it, unconstitutionaL The Earl of ABERDEEN, although entertaining opinions *ery similar to those of the noble and learned lord (Lyndhturst) with respect to the patent in question, felt strongly the inconvenience of appointing a Committee of Privileges, being convinced that it would lead to the difficultyin which it appeared aiready to have involved them. He had thought from the iir.st that the a<ppointment of a select committee for the purpose of exammning the particular question was the orly course likely to lead to a satisfactory conclusion; and it now appeared that their lordships had resolved to sppoint what was equivalent to a select comniitteeto inquire into it. Tord LYNDHURST thought the direction of the com.mittee was to examine, consider, and report upon the patent granted to Baron Parke. They were now examining;after they had examined they would consider; and then tSe result of that consideration vrould be reported to the Hloue To say they were not to investigate was absurd. How could they examnine without hearing evidence W hen it was said thattheyhad brought this difliculty upon themselves by referring the patent to a Cormittee of Privileges, his reply wras thatif 'ne hdnot moved for a Committee of Privileges precisely the same inquiry would have taken placeatthe barof the House. He did not believe a single instance could be found in which the validity of a patent had not been discussed, either in the house itself or before a Committee of Privileges. The Marquis of CLANICAIDB did not think that any inconvenience would result from the present mode of in. quir. HIf the House had taken the matter into its own han it would have been necessary to collate the precedents bearing on the case, and to ascertain what they were worth. That was exactly the course which the colmmittee was advised to pursue, and he realy could not see what objections could be taken to it, especially when he recollected that in the debate on Thursday night the organs of the Government stated that one of their objects in granting a life peerage to Baron Parke wa:s to raise the question. Earl GRANVILLE denied having stated that a life peerage was gsnnted to Baron Parke with a view to raise the oluestion. In answer to the argument urged on the other side, that this was a wanton exercise of the prerogative, he stated that a similar offer having been made to a learned and very distinguished judge, and he having declined it on the ground that he knew such a creation to be unpopular, the Government thought it a decided advantage that so eminent a man as Baron Parke should be the first to accept the dignity. The Earl of CARNARVON regretted that the question had ever been raised, but, a Committee of Privileges having been appointed, they were bound to proceed with the inquiry in the manner proposed. The LORD CHANCELLOR.-It has been twice stated that Lord Wensleydale was selected in order to try the validity of a life peerage. It is impossible that I could have used such an expression, when I protest solemnly that until the evening before the meeting of Parliament I never heard a whisper as to the illegality of the proceeding. (Hear, hear.) What I stated was, that if there were doubts in the mind of any gentleman as to the propriety of accepting such an honour, if it were supposed to be conferred either on account of his poverty, or because, having a large family, he might entail a poor posterity upon the House, the Government might congratulate itself on the sdection of Lord Wensleydale, who was neither poor nor lkeyto entail any posterity at al upon the House When my noble friend the Lord Chief Justice first spoke to me on this subject, which he did in a very friendly way on the first day of term, he expressed extreme doubt as to the policy of the measure, but, as toits legali ty, he said he bad not the least doubt on earth about it. (A laugh.) Lord CAMPBELL (with some warmth).-No, no ! (Laughter.) The LORD CHANCELLOR.-I am sure that if my noble friend says so I mnisunderstood him, but I protest most solemnly that he did say something which I understood in that sense. Lord CAblPBELL-AUllow me to state what took place between my noble friend and mysel£ When I had the honour to attend hislevee on the first day of term I toldhim that I had heard, but did not beieve, that Baron Parke was to be caDed up to this house as a peer for life. He replied that itwas quite true. "Well, then," said I, "I am sorry I shall be obliged to make a row aboutit as soon as Parliament meets." (Laughter.~) Earl GRANVILLE.-Admitting that the noble and learned lord has accurately described the conversation whieh he had with my noble and learned friend near me, and that he then thought the patent illegal, perhaps he wil explain bow he came to change his opinion. (A laugh.) Lord CABPBELL.-I am not aware that I have ever expressed any decided opinion ono way or the other. In the debate the other night I frankly acknowledged that the impression upon my mind was, that peerages ror life might legaUy be created. My authority for that was Lord Coke; but I was not aware upon what the doctrine rested, nor was I acquainted with a single precedent upon one side or the other. When I found, however, that there had been no such creation for 400 years, and that even beyond those 400 years no instance had been produced in which a commoner had sat in this house as a peer for life, the impression upon my mind was certainly weakened; and I have no hesitation i saying that, unless some such instance can be produced, I shal come to the opinion that it is beyond the prerogative of the Crown to create a peerage for life only. (gear, hear.) The Marquis of CLANRICARDE, after what had been stated by the President of the Council, must admit that he had misapprehended bins h ut, at the same time, it was a misapprehension which had been shared in by several other noble lords. Lord LYNDHURST then moved, that any additional evidencehe should prepare for being laid before the House should be printed, and ready to be laid on the table on Monday, in connexion with the evidence which he had already produced. Lord DUNGANNON expressed his belief that the creation which now occupied the attention of their lordships would pave the way to a complete annihilation of the dignity, consequence, and independence of their lordships' house. (Hear.) The committee then adjourned tiU Monday, at 2 o'clock. The House resumed, the IORD CHAiNCELLOR on the woolsack. Lord CAMPBELL said, he would now make the motion of which he had iven notice, vi., that their lordsh make an order, giving tn his right hon. friend Baron Paree the opportunity to appear before the Committee of Privileges, if he sothought fit, either by himself or by counseL Is hisright hon. friend should appear, he could take his seat on the woolsack and speak from thence. The LORD CHANCELLOR objected to the terms in which his noble and learned friend appeared disposed to issue the order, viz-to his right hon. friend, BaronParke. Lord CAMPBELL did not mean to insinuate any opinion by this mode of expression. The LORD CANCELLOR said, the order, if issued by the House, must be addressed to the right hon. James Baion Wensleydale. (Hear, hear.) Nobody had called in question the right of Her Majesty to create him a baron for some purposes-the only question was whether that gave him a right to sit in that house. (Hear, hear.) The Earl of DERBY had been struck with surprise to see the name of Baron Wensleydale on the Roll of their Lordships' House. Their lordships not having admitted the claim or right of that persontositimthe house, hecalledin question the proprety Of his name being placed on the rolL He called their lordships' attention to the fact, in order that the title of Baron Wensleydale being on the roll of the House shlould not be held as a precedent, or be of any weight in this or any other case. IHear hear.) Lord REDESDALE said, the roll was prepared by the clerk, andby no other authority. lord BROUGHAM suggested that, under all the circumstances, t wouldbe better for his noble and learned friend (Lord Campbell) not to press his motion now, but to give notice of it for another d'ay. Lord CPBELI, maid, he would accept tthis suggestion, and named Thursday for themnotion. The Marquis of LANSDOWNE said, it was impossible to admit any motion that would imply a doubt as to the title of Baron Wensleydale. It was the undoubted prerogative of the Crown to confer such a title. (Hear, ear.) His noble and learned friend (Lord Campbell) had progressed very much en this subject. HE admitted that he had hinion-that in former years he believed He Maesty had~ the title, privilege, and authority to make such peerages aS the present, hut that, on looking into the authorities, he had altered the opinions he then held. lTeither his noble and learned friend howeve,r, nor any other noble and learned lord had, u to that moment, ventured to intimate a doubt as to whether Her Majesty had or had not the right to confer any title and give right of precedence. (Hear, hear.) He would be surprised, indeed, if his noble and learned friend should state that he- had any doubt on the subject (hear, hear), but it could only be with a doubt on this subject that the House should bo at all called to entertain the qaestion. By all the anthorities hu had read, and in al the speeches he had lstened to, it was admitted that Her Majesty had the right-a right supported by a cloud of witnesses-to confer titles of precedence. (Hear, hear.) The question arose only when the person upon whom Her Majesty had thought fit to confer a title presented himself to be admitted into their lordship? house. Baron Parke swouldappear in that house as Lord Wensleydale ; made ]itord Wensleydale by Her Majety; entitled to precedence as lord Weasleyae-a predence of which their lordsbips, ,wI* all their commlittees and all their reports,' could not 3lewy deprive him. (Hear, hear.) Xqxo REDESDALE hoped his noble and learned friend w'ould -Mt persevere in his motion that Lord Wenslevdale ,add iv hinnelf heard before their lordships" fonse. j,eer wAse precedent in the case of the Duke of Hamilton, whL'n he Ecandon peerage was claimed, and when the X Houseo ' e.hvdto hearthe clamant byhiscounsel. He (Lord Rede*) togght it impossble that Lord Wensleydnle should h,iew b hieard, for he could not conceive i what no longer ajudg ndhe dnorightto address their lordsbOg , A pet n.+ >ShStibi3eat lord WcnBey. dale could not act as apeer withoat abjectium fmlf to heavypetalties, and he (Lord Redesdale) di4 nob thin o it decorous that he should appear at the tai. In his ILord Redesdale's) opinion, the better courst would be to hero to the precedent he had mentioned_. The Earl of ABERDEE tho',oght the case of the Duke of Hamilton did not aPPlY to' f~atrnEder discussion, for as the Duke of -amilton was t'ne of the 16 peers of Scotland, he was entitled to appear in his place and address their lordsbips. Lord CA3PBELt raid, bhe was ready to amend his motion, and he propcsed " that the right hon. Baron Wensleydalo may be heard by his counsel lfore the committee of thiiHouse." tHear, hear.) The LORD CHANCELLOR put the motion in these terms- -^- That at the Committee of Privileges on M£ondav next the right hon. Baron Wensleydale be alowed to attend by his counsel, if he shall think fit." The motion was agreed to, and the committee adjournel at a few minutes before 4 o'cloclk The House resuned at 5 o'clock. Tord ELLENBOROUGH presented a petition from the seamen of two ports, complaining of what they beEeved to be the state of the law, compelinig sailors to go to sea in ships which they believed to be unseaworthy. The noble lora asked whether there was any intention on the part of the Government to introduce any measure on the sabject? lord STANIEY of A TDERLEY was not aware of any distinct measure in which the subject mentioned would be dealt with. Their lordships then adjourned at 20 minutes after 5 o'clock.
HOUSE OF COMONS, TUESDAY, FEE.. 12. The House met at 4 o'clock. NEW hEMhIERS. Nr. WALPOLE took the oaths and his seat for the University of Cambridge, and Nr. RIDLL, for Newcastle. NBW WRIT. On the motion of Colonel TAYLOR, anew writ was ordered to issue for the borough of Leominster, in consequence of the death of Mr. Arkwright. PRIVATE BUSINESS. The folowing bills were read a second time and ordered to be committed :-Bagenalstown and Wexford Railway; Bardney, &c., Drainage; Bawtry and Tinsley-road- Crowland and Eye-road; Dewsbury, Batley, and Hecknondwike Water; Forest of Dean Central Railway Hampstead .Juncton Rsilway; London, Tilbury, and So;thendm ail- ayZAdditional (apstal, &c.; London, Tilbury, andSouthend Rcailway (Extension and BranchesJ; Perth, Almondvalley, and tIethven Railway; Perth Burgh and Harbcour;Poole and Bourne-va31ey Railway; Uttoxeter and Blythe. mnarsh-road, and Wem and Bronygarth-roads. The following petitions were presented, by Mr. At cowx, from Brockham, against opening the British Museum on the Lord's-day; by Mr. HoLFonD, from the Dissenters of Chedworth, Glocestershire, against opening the public museums or the Crystal Palace on the Lord's-day; and by MIr.

DAvIEs relative to the HIarbcour of Refuge andDefence, &o. BROADSTAIRS HARBOUR, PIER, AND LANDING- PLACE BTl: Upon the second reading of this biU being moved, hIr. DEEDES moved, as an amendment, that it be read a second time that day six months, upon the ground that the commissioners promoting the bill sought power, by the 14th clause, to levy a compulsory rate on the whole parish of St. Peter's, of which the population was 3,000, and the assesESment 14,0001. a-year, while the hamlet of Broadstiris, included in it, was assessed only at 3,0001. a-year. The parishioners of Broadstairs bad petitioned against the bill, and among the 109 subscribers were 9 of the combuissiouers, who must be considered the promoters of the hilL Mr. BROTHERTON was authorized to withdraw the 14th clause. Mr. DEEDES then withdrew the amendment, and the bill was read a secolid time, and ordered to be committedL COLNBROOK, DATCHET, AND SLOUGH ROAD On the motion for the second reading of this bill, Mr. GRENFELL moved that the bill be read a second time that day six months. Mfr. DU PRE supported, and Mr. S. RrcARDo opposed, the bill. The House divided, when the numbers were- For the second reading ... ... ... 101 Against it ... ... ... ... ... 66 Mfajority. ... .. 35 The bill was then read a second time. CONWAY AND LLANDUDNO ROAD BILTL On the motion that this bill be read a second time, Colonel NOX. opposed the second reading on the ground that a line of railway about to be completed rendered a new road unnecessary. Mr. MACARTNEY offered to postpone the second reading untUl Monday. Mr. FITZROY hoped the bil would be allowed to go 'efore a select committee. The House divided, when the numbers were- For the second reading ... 179 Against it ... ... ... ... ... 40 ajorty ... . --139 The bill was therefore read a second time. MIDLAND GRE-tT WESTERN RAILWAY OF IRELAND. Mr. FRENCH moved the second reading of this bill. Sir T. BURKE moved that it be read a second time that day six months. He said that in 1845 this Midland Railway was began, and the county he represented, along with two baronies of Rosconmmon, guaranteed the interest in the event of its not reaching a certain amount, and had paid a considerable sum on that account. Afterwards the chairman of the company agreed to make a line in a certain direction, but since thenthe company had joined with another line and had diverted the traffic. Mr. BELLEW seconded the motion in opposition to the bil, colnplaining of the absence of good faith, which had characterized the company. They were too poor to carry out their original pledges, but at the same time they were rich enough to undertake a new scheme which appeared to them to be more advantageous. Mr. G. H. MOORE and Mr. F. FR&Nmcw supported the seeond reading. Mr. LOWE thought the matter would be more fitly discussed in committee than on the second reading. The amendment was then withdrawn and the bill read a second time. The Prisoner4 Discharge Society Bill was read a second tine. SPECLILTY AND CONTRACT DEBTS. Mr. MALINS gave notice that he should on that day fortnight ask leave to introduce a biU to abolish the distinction between specialty and simple contract debts; EVICTIONS IN IRELAND. MYr. MIMAHON gave notice that he should on that day fortnight move the appointment of a select committee to consider and devise some means of restraining the wholesale depopulation of the rural districts of Ireland, as an evil tending to endanger the peace in those districts, and to increase pauperism in the cities and towns of the united kingdom. THE SALARIES OF COUNTY COURT JUDGES. Mr. ROEBUCK said that he should on that day fortnight move for leave to introduce a biU for the regulation of the salaries of County Court judges. PXUBLIC PROSECUTOR. M1r. J. PH1LLIMORE gave notice that he should on Tuesday next move for a committee to consider the pro. priety of appointing a public prosecutor. T1E REVERSIONARY INTERESTS OF MARRIED WOMEN. Mr. MLINS stated that he should on that day fortnight ask leave to introduce a bill to enable married women to dispose of reversionary interests in personal estate. THE ADMISSION OF ORPHAN CADETS TO SAND. HURST COLLEGE. Colonel NORTH recalled to the recollection of the House that a committee which sat last year recommended the admission of 10 additional cadets of the orphan class to the Royal Mlitary College of Sandhurst, which suggestion the Govermuent promised to carry into effect; and begged to ask the Under-Secretary for War what steps had been taken to carry out that recommendation ? Mr. PEEL replied that no steps had yet been taken to fil up the roposed cadetships. When the Government reconsidered tne course which it was stated they intended to pursue it was thought better that the matter should stand over for a time, in order that it might be seen whether any measure to be proposed in regard to this subject might not include other suggestious made by the cormmittee, and whether a general p for the education of the orphans of officers and soldiers might not be devise(L Colonel NORTH inquired whether the relations of cadets in the existing orphan class would be relieved from the expense of maintaining them at Sandhurst e Mr. PEEL said that the recommendation of the committee was that new cadetships should be constituted, the holders of which should contribute nothing towards 'their maintenance. No steps had as yet been taken to carry out thiat recommendation. RAILWAY ACCIDENTS. Mr. S. FITZGERALD begged to ask the Vice-President of the Board of Trade whether it was his intention to propose, during the present session, any measure for the prevention of accidents on railways; and also, as it appe3red from the proceedings in reference to the report of the officer appointed to inquire into the condition of the Eastern Counties Railw/ay that, though the Board of Trade had the power to direct inquiries into the condition of any line of railway, it had no power to compel the repaihS that m.ight be absolutely necessary for the security of the public, whether-itwaslhis intention to introduce any measure for the purpese of investiung the Board of Trade with the authority necesary for the purpose? Mr. LOWE replied that his noble friend the Preident of the Board of Trade proposed to introduce into another place the sarme biU with regard to railway acidents M e h. pieposed last sescion. The matter referred to in th secwndpar of his hon. fAend's question was xtill under consde:. tion. THE GRAND T)UY SYSTEM AND MEE WASTE LAND9 OF IREMND. Xr. M"MAHON rose to kc the Chief Secrear for Ire la^d whether it was his intention to introduce Wrng the prent,esessdon meiiures for facilitating the rclama. tion of waste lands in Ireland, and for the amendment of the Iish grand jury system? Mr. HOERs N said that it was not the intention of the Govermnent to introduce measures on either of tho5e subjects. - - POSTAL COMIUNICATION BETWEEN IRELAND AND SCOTLAND. Sir J. FERGtSSON inquired of the Chief Secretary for Ireland what stops the Government intended to take to bring under the notice of the Treasury the various memorials presented to the Lord-Lieutenant on the subject of an improved postal conununication between Belfast and the north o£ Ireland on the one aide, and Scotland and the north of England on the other?r Mr. HORSMAN replied that it was the intention of the Lord-Lieutenanttoforwardthese memorials to theTreasury, and to recommend the subject to the consideration of the Lords Coynmissioners. COMERCIAL TREATY WITH MOROCCO. Colonel W. PATTEN asked whether the joint commission agreed to in the mouth of August last by the Emperor of Morocco and Her Majestys Mlinister Plenipotentiary to arrange a commercial treaty had yet met) and, if not, what was the cause of the delay? Lord PALMERSTON was sorry to say that the commission had not yet "met. The renresentative of Morocco teTangierswasto have received flnpowers in the early part oT January. Those powers were not received by him and Mr. Hay gave him notice-andi desired that he WOullA eommunicate it toLisGovernment-that, unless such powrers werereceivedbyhim within4 days from the f of January hepowr. Hay) should feel it to be his duty to enter a protest agamst the dBlatory proceedings of the Government of Morocco, and should hold that Govemnment responsible for any darnage to British interests which might arise from the delay thus oeasioned by their defatit. That wrotethe should communicate to the consuls of foreign Powers at Tangiers. The 40i days had not yet pired, and he (Lord Palmeraten) hoped that by the end of that time the full powers wouldbhave arrived. THE 1JNLFOR OF NAVAL OFFICERS. . IMfr. BRIY asked the First Lord of the Admiralty wvhether he ntended TO alter the regulations by which the following oficers in Her Majesty's navy-vein, inspectors ad deputy-inspectors of tospitals, staff surgeons, surgeons and assistant-surgeons, paymasters and assistant-paymasters -were not allowed to have the distingemehint mark of gold lace on the cuffs of their undress coats, by which they were reduced to a level with the inferior grades of offiecrsa? Sir is WOOD was afraid he must confess some ignorance of what might be a part of his duty. he did not know whether the offcers referred to had or had not gold lace on thelr cuffs. (A laugh.) The whole question of the uniform of the navy, both of the miltary and cvil branches of the service, was under the consideration of the Admradnlty, and he honsd the result would be to remove all just cas of complait. THE CONFE3RENCES AT CONSTANTJOPLE. lfr. LAYAiD.-I wVish to ask a question of the noble lord at the head of Her Majests Government, but if it be inconvenient to him to answver it at once I will repeat it on Thursday. There is a report that conferences are being held at Constantinople for the arran,gement of certain questions referring to the rights of the Christian subjects of Turkey, and also for the settlement of the principalities. It is also reported that from these conferences the representative of the Sardinian Government has been eccluded, and that he has in consequence protested. Iwish tonask the noble lord whether the Sardinian Minister hasbeentexcluded from these conferences; and, if so, on what account ? Leord Pina ERSTOa g.-It was arranged between. the Govermnents of France, England, Austria, and Trrkey that the represeutatives of the three first named Powers at Constantinople should meot for the purpose of considering, in contnction with the Turksish Government, the measures referred to in the fourth and first points-that is, the arrangement to be made by the Sultan inrfavoureof his Christian subjects, and those to be made in regardtothe principalities. The Sardinis Government has not been communicated vdth upon these matters. They werenotconnectedwith the treatg of peace,butwereintendedif possible to besettledby the authorityofEthe Sultanindependently, and not as part of thae arrangements resitinlg from that treaty. The Sardimnan charg6 d'affajres applied to be admnitted to the conferences. Thy e ambassadors of England and France had no instructions upon the subject. They wrote for such instruetions, and meanwhile the Sardinian Minister was not preseat at the meetings. The proceedings of the conferences have hitherto been confuned to matters arising out of the fonrth point-Vi2., the arrangements to be e for the protection of the rights and privileges of the non-fussulman subjects of the Port&e MINICIPAL; REFORM.-sCOTLA2qD. Mr. EWVART moved for leave to bringin a bill to extend the provisions of the Scottish Municipal Reform Actrto certain Royal burghs in Scotland, now excluded fron the benefits of that act. It had been originally intended that the nine Royal burghs of Scotland should be reforued like allother mnheicipal bodies in the same country, but for some reason or another, of hich he had never heard a satisfactory erplanation, this intention had not been carried into effect. The Royal bgrghs, withdratin from the operation of the general measure for the reorganization of similar corporations, had been left to endure all the evils of a magistracy which, being self-elected, was, to a great degree, irresponsible. The object of the bill wvhich he nowe equestednthe permission of the reouse to introduce woas to hint an end to this exceptional awdanomlobus state of thSi7gs, by extending to certa3n Royal burhs in Scotland that same pbniliple of popular control which had been ahleady applted with such advantage to the other burghs of Scotland. (Hear, hear.) It would be difficult to exaggerate the inouryfthat had been inflicted on the Royal burghs by abandoning them to an oldand vicious 5ystem which in other places had been long since consigned to oblivion. There r;as no recprocal confidence between the ratepayers and theirmunicipal representatives; nosmaterial tmgrovemen weas permitted to be effected, nor was it possib?e to bring the burgh within the operation of the Borough Police Bill of Scotland. e nother great evil was, that the magistrates, whio, being, as already observed, self-eleted, were not amenable to populr control, resided at a distance from the town. All these anomalies would be aboelshed by the present bill, to the introduction of which he had learnt with much satisfaction that it was not the intention of the Lord-Advocate to offer any oppositon. Some of the urghs, he wtas well aware, woere too smal to be intrusted with the privilege of self-government; but others of them, whether viewewith reference to population, pubc spirit, or-intelligence, were fully competent to elect their own magistrates, instead of having them forced upon them, nn& it was for their benefit that the bill for which he now solicited the attentive consideraton of the lHouse as especially intended. (Hear, hear.) L ord DUNCAN, having intimated that there was no intention on the part of the Lord-Advocate to oppose the introduction of the bill, explained that the reason why the ncie Royal hurghs referred to had been nomuinally excluded from the operation of the Scottish Municipal Reform Act was simply that in some cases their population was so insignificant that it was altogether out of the question to think of extendmng the principle of self-government to them. (Hear, hear.) There was one ~burgh in particular the constituency of which did not, when thle Scottish Municipal Reform Act w;as passed, exceed 28, and even though the principle of self-government had been applied to it, the magistracy would, to all intents and purposes, be still self-elected. He would not resist the introductionof the bill, but, in the absence of the Lord-Advocate, who had no such sanguine expectations of it as were entertaineil by tho hon. member who had brought it forward, h. could not hold out any promise that the Government would support the measure in its subsequent stages. The bill was then brought in and read a first time. A3-METI OF THE LAWS. 1r. NAPIER then rose to propose the following resolution:-" That, in the opinion of this House, as a measure of administrative reform, provision should be made for an efficient and responsible department of public justice, with a viewto secure the skdlful preparation and proper structure of Parliamentary bils, and promote the progressive amendment of the laws of the united kingdom.' The right hon gentleman observed that it was in redemption of a promise he had given last session that he now proceeded to bring under the consideration of the House a subject which, though domestic in its nature, was not inferior either in interest or importance to any of those more exciting foreign questions which had of late engaged so much of their attention. It was manifestly a matter of great moment, since it related to the amendment and consolidation of the laws, and to the condition and character of our current legislation. (Hear, hear.) It had been well and truly remarked that, while they were continully improving arts and manufactures, that which was of the greatest possible importance toa people-the framing of the laws under which they lived-was by us left without improvement, and could scarcely be said to attract any large amount of public notice. (Hear, hear.) This was no isolated or departmental question. (Hear, hear.) it was one in which the whole community had an interest. The House could not but acknowledge its maganitude, nor fail to be sensible that it was their duty to talke the subject zealously in hand, and to do everything in their power to improve as far as possible the existing theory and practice of current legislation in this country. (Elear, hear.) He proposed to divide the question into three branches, and to call attention, first, to theactul state of things; then, to the remedies which had already been tried without success ; and, finally, to the course which he would respectfully venture to recommend for the adoption of the House. This matterhadbeen mooted last session, and the public had a right to expect that Parliament would now be prepared to come to some conclusion upon it. The present state of the law was, he said it advisedly, disgraceful to a civiised country. (Hear, hear.) To say nothing at present of the written and the unwritten law-of the comnmon law and of the customs scattered through a,vast number of volumes-there were three distinct systems of kegislation in progress for England, Scotland, and Ireland, snd to there systems PArliament was every day malingaddions. As far as Scotlai was concred, that eountry, trmth to' say, gve them iry little tron,ble; Scotland was veiy much of a self-spiortimn counr7. The Seotch did not in2terfere with others, sd though Yhey took, ad conm=esidably go, very gpod gar of their own affairs, they did not tresp much. c tho attention of that House. With Ireland the case was diss. rent. No part of J.e united kingdom sufered more aeverelyfrom the present state of the laws and the currt system oE legislation than Ireland. (Hear, hear.) Parliament wa not endeavouring to give to that country the full benefit of the Act of Union; for, instead of trying to make identityco legisltion the rule and dissimilarity the exeptiozs. they had set on foot for Ireand a very iteffective system of law-making-a system which wa of pecial and distinctive character, and which, bing ;et innotion for the most part after midnight, did not tend( to promote the interests of that kingdom or to draw cloetr she bonds of amity between the two countrier Putting aside private and local acts there werebetweenEnglandani Ireland no fewer than 18,24 statutes. Thisenormos addi. tion had been nade to the common aw of both conmtrie&' and waswhollyindependentoftheScotshlaw, which restel on a different basis, and one whichhe didnotseektodistrb. Of English statutesthere were 3SOvolumes, and of Irish 19 but in the case of Ireland there were additional elements of complication No fewer than 2,2G3 statutes passed befora the Union were peculiar to lreland, and 1,300 other statute5 of the Imperial Parliament enacted since that period also applied to that country. The confusion of Irish lawvas, nowvever, still worse confounded by the fact that in addition to the foregoingmassof statutes Iieand was subject,under what; was called Poyning's law, to all the acts passed in England down to the reign of Henry VIIL Lord Bacon, writing at aperiod when ourpublicstatutes were only 2,171 in num ber, remarked that "so great was theaccumulation of statutes, so often did those statntes cross each other, and so intricate were they, that thecertaintyof the law was entirely lost in the heap." Yet during the reign of Her present Majesty alone more public acts bad be passed than were contained in the entire statute-book as it stood at the death of Queen Elirbeth. Some of the acts still suffered to encumber the statute-book were so absurd and even ludicrous in their nature as only to requir tobe named in order to be universallycouteiL For examyle, o,e of those las imposed a penaity ou Irisfh prelate3 for collating an Irishman to a benefice in England, or for bringing an Irishman to Parliament to discover the counrels of Englishmen to rebels; another defined what classes of lifihmen might come to dwell in England, declaring that none should he permitted to do so who had not procured a testimonial from the Lord-Lieutenant; another related to the carrying of coals to Newcastle (laughter); another prohibited a man, under a pecuniary penalty, from keeping more than 2,000 shee; and another was intended to regulate abstimence from esh in Lent and other usual times. At the close of Queen Anne's reign the number of public statutes in existence was 3,277, of which no fewer than 2,074 had been either wholly or partially repealed, had become obsolete, or had expired; and the recent expurgate list included 10,047 statutes for England alone, Last year a resolution was passeed in that house ordering a bil forthawith to be introduced for the sweeping away of this huge heap of dead legislation, but that most desirable object had not yet been accomplished, Indeed, the noble Premier told them the other night that the task was one which far exceeded the powers of the present Government, or any other that was likely to succeed it. That was certainly a very discouraging intimation to the friends of law reform, and yet it ought toinducethem to grantafavourablo corsideration to the remedy which he (Mr. *Napier) nowbum. bly suggested. (Hear.) I the course of the last session of Par. liamnent 134 public acts were passed, comnrisig 1,00 po es of which 92 pages onl yapplied to the united kUgdom, 10 to Great Britain, 22 to England and Ireland, and 102 to England; the remainder, or neatly 800 pages, having no connexion whatever with inperial interests. Yet all this mass of miscellaneous legislationwas huddled together without, the least classification, and went to aggravate the already too formidable difficulties which beset the task of tha revision of the statute-book whenever that task might be seriously undertaken. The question, therefore, was, "Should we, with all the wisdomn and learnin, e vps. sessed, in this enlightened age, continue to rem an supie and inert without taking any step to clear away this he incubus and dead weight which bestrode and crushed the legal system of the empire like a nightmare?" let them take an example from the Justlnian Code, which Vwa3 perfected in less than four years, 14 months of which were spent in expurgating and selecting amicd an accumulation of laws ranging over a period of 10 centuries. The Pandects and Institutes were also completed im three years; 3,000,000 of sentences being reduced to 150,000 by Trebonian and 17 lawyers, who directed theirundivided energies and their exclusive attention to a work which they regarded it as an honour and an ambition to execute, and which they achieved with a marvellous success. that rendered their conjoint labours a monument of wisdom. for the admnirtion and instruction of after times. .Ag n, there was the Code Napoleon, for the framing of which a. commission of jurists was appointed on the 12th of Augast, 180D. The commission reported in four months; theirreport was submitted to the press and the courts for their criticism and opinions; on the 17th of July, 1801, the discussions upon it commenced in the Council of State-those, discussions were interrupted, from political causes, fron, January to September, 102; they were afterwards resumed andacontinueduntilthe 17th of March, 1804; and they wereentirely concluded in 102 sittings. A more modern instance was that of the New York code, which was com- 'ried in three octvo volumes It consisted of a complete, digast of the statute law, with which was also incoiporated' as much of the common law as was not properly separable from it Speaking of this code, Mr. ParLer, a judge of thae Supreme Court of New York, in July, 1853, said:- "The 'revised statutes' only profess to be a codifieatioen of the statute law; such parts of the common law as theycomprise are only what could not be separated from statutory enactments. Practically no inconvenience is felt from the circumstance that part of the lawv is in the form of a code, and the remainder not; nor is the want of precise definitions of theterins used in the code found to create dif-- ficulty. On the whole, the revision is considered entirly successful and is popular with the profession." (Hear.) We knew that Lord Baconinade proposalsto Jamesl for the consolidation and reform of our law, and when the King made that eminent man Attorney-Gentral and a. Privy Votunclor, Lord Bacon drew up a paper in which he said that he should best show his gratitude for the Royal favours bestowed on him by sstimg in the work of reducing and recompiling the laws of England, and he pro- posedcto expurgateall repealed, obsolete, and unsuitabler statutes, especially the penal acts which he thought wereunit to be continued in force after they were at variancewith the spirit and temper of the times. Some persons. said that these obsolete statutes should be alowed to remain as they were, because they couldinjure nobody. On this point, however, LordlBaconpithilyobserved tlhat "these laws weakened the authority of the rest, and tlhat " the. livig died in the arms of the dead," (Hear.) le also recommended that the work of remodelling the laws should; proceed in accordance with the wisdom and enlightenmenti of the age; and (what was more importantthan th-e mere technical improvement Of the language of acts of Parliamnent) that they should not seek to Push the functiour of legislation beyond their legitimate booundarie, by i-.- trndig into the province of religion, education, and other moral idnfuences. Lord Bacon also referred to the Justinian Code and the Sex Viri at Athens, and suggested that. commissioners should be 'appointed to be named by both Houses of Parliameiit, not with a precedent power to conclude, but only to prepare and propound. In ln. quaint speech to Parliament, in answer to these proposals, King: Jaes1 said : "There be in the common law divers contrary reportsand precedents; and this corruption doth likevise concern the statutes and acts of Parliament, in respect. that there are divers cross and cuffing statutes, antd some so penned as they may be taken in divers, yea contrary senses; and therefore would I wish both those statutes and reports, as weU in the Parliament as common law, to be once maturely reviewed and reconciled, and that not only aU contrarieties should be scraped out of our books, but even that such penal statutes as were made. but forthe use of the time (from breach whereof no man can be free), which do not now agree with the condition of this our time, ought likewise to be left out of our books, which, under a tyrannous or avaritious king, could not ble endored; and this reformationmight, methinirs, be made a. worthy work, and well deserves a Parliament to be sat oE purpose for it " AIthough at that time the statutes did not actually unmber so many as those passed in the reign of her present Majesty alone, yet such was then the state of things that the proosition he bad read wvas recommended byBlacon, and proposed to Parliament by King James. In 17t87, Mr. Hargreave. well known as an eminent juris4, -adverting to the increasd. evils then to beremedied, raid:- WouldBacon and Hale have remained unconcerned spectators of the most dangerous of all juridical diseases' Would they not have earnestly supplicated the Sovereign, or, perhaps, tlle Parliament, to save the country from that run whica must ensue the moment the science of law ana the administration of justiceshaU ceaseto bepracticableT' Since the time this was penned the statutes had doubled in number, and in 1816 the evil was felt so much that a resolution was passed in the Lords for classifying thi statutes. A similar resolution was agreed to in that house, and after an address to the Crown upon the subject a partial. consolidation was effected. Since 1816 we had aided toour code 49585 pubic statutes. About that time there existed some eminent law reformers, among -whom were Mfacintosb, Romilly, and Brougham; and in 1823 we hadthat great work of Sir IL Peel-one of the greatest monuments of his practical statesmnanship and ability which. perhaps he had left behind him,-namely, the consolidation. of our criminal code. He might ideed, say of this that- it stood monumentum orue perennits. Sir r Peel aailed. hiAmself of the very best advice in bringing about this consolidation; the Chancellor acknowledged that when heapplied to the lawyers and the judges for theiraisistance, they. Mae it in the most hearty m anner, and accorodingly his attempt was eminently suecessfaL B t this step in adTance only arplied to our criminal law. In 1&,3 Lord. Brougham, when Chancellor, appointeda conmmission, which reported in 1835, and they came to this conclusion:- -'We also think that a complete and systematic consolidation, accompanied with an adjustment of the enactments to precedent and judicial decision, is practicable and desirable; but so extensive a reform, however beneficial corld not, we are aware, be safely acomplished withott great psin, nor ought it to be attempted without cautiously weighing the means of performing so arduous a task, and steadily contemp lating the difficulties to be encountered in its execution. Nothing came of this, however. A great deal of advice had been offered, m any nersons had pointed out what ought to be done, but what they wanted was that something shoujld be done.. (Hea.)In.) 3.843 10rd Broughan addressed a letter to the right .on. baronet the m ember for Carlisle, who when in office took a deep interest in these rmatters, and at last, in February, 1853, tho present Lord Chancellor laid before Parliament a plan for consolidatingthe statute.- Lav .His lordship sulggested that they sihould at once set to wrork, and his plan ws certainly an adirble one, IRe pbeposed to begin with thevwork of cxliurgation;* then, whaen that was done, they were to classiFy; afterthiu to e did«te; arid he preoed also (which was a moa i.

THE CASE OF TBS IHON. AIss MTIusiAY-Several statements have appeared in our Contemporariesinreference to the Hon. Miss 2Murray and her American work, in which some mnisapprehen;ions appear to prevail reclardin the position of that lidv in the Royal bousehol . ;e facts are these .-Miss Murra had been, up to about a year since, maid of honour (not Lady in waiting) to the Queen. She filed that office since tbe period of Her Majdesty's acces sion for about 18 years, anu therefore, vwithout being ver ungallant, we may say wa. not in that bloom of youth which one is wont to associate with the title of mdid of bonour. Miss Murray had, in fact, reached a period of service beyond what is customaty. Her Mtajesty, however, with that delicate consideration which she so eminently poisesses, made Miss Murray an extra maid of honour,which waa equivalent to permission to retire upon full salasi. Since her appointment as extra maid of honour Miss Murray has done no duty at Court, and she doubtless would have no difficulty in obtaining unlinmited leave of absence from the Lord Chamberlain. Her position i3 therefore merey nominal, and, whatever opinion Her Majesty may have respecting Miss Murray's pro-slavery predilections, it has not been evinced in any way to affect tbat lady's nmaterial in- rests.-CUort Jburnal,
LONDON, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 156. The House of Lords met yesterday at 2 o'clock. On the motion of the LoRD CaiAxELIOt, the House resolved itself into a Committee of Privileges on the patent of the Wensleydale Peerage. Lord Lmmnusr stated what would be the imme. diate course of proceeding. Various precedents would be produced in evidence; he shonld then propose that those documents from the records be trans]ated and printed, so as to be regularly before the House. Mr. HL G. SHAnPE, Assistant-Keeper of the Polls, was called to the bar,- and produced the original patents of creation of two peerage3 of thereign of RICIARD II.-GISCRD D'A o-a, created Earl of HvNrGDozx; and Dr. ViYE, Earl of OxFonD, created :Marquis, and then Duke of DummN. He gave in a list of several others, which have been printed in the series of national records containing the patents of peerage. The patent of the Earl of HuT.LNGDox was abjiost illegible from age and discoloration andthe witness read the contents of the parchment roll from the printed volume of the records. The creation oEthis Peer was for life. The patent of the Earl of OxronD was also a creation for life onily. Mr. SuAitE.-wa3 reading the latter patent when Le was interrupted by Lord ELLxNBoRorcan who.requcsted him to read clearly and slowly, as the flomse could not follor the old law Latin when read rapidly;- The interruption gave rise to an irregular conrersation of some length. The LonD CHAxCEoRmOaid it was not the practice to read such doctnents at length; all that was necessary was to give themi in. It would be convenient to accelerate the proceedings as mruh Ma possible, as he knew it wa the intee.
The discussion on the right of the ChowM to create a peerage for life has now reached a point at which we may do wisely to resume the whole question, to see whence it arose aud whitlhir it tends, and to examine it from the point of view of each of the disputonts who have been so fully heard before the public. What, then, has been the cause of this contreversy Clearly and undeniably this,-that the appellate jurisdiction of the House of Lords has become a scandal and a reproach to that noble body and an intolerable oppression and grievance to the public. Of oir two appellate courts the Judicial Committee of the-Privy Council has been continually rising while the Howse of Lords has been as constanxtly falling in thie opinion of lawyers and litigants, till.its high appellate finctions lhave become a source of weakness to the vcry body of which they were oncw considered the strength and honour. The neglect of all judici propriety, thO smalhieam 0;.the numbers, the diversity of the opinions, have with astonishment aud dismay lawyers trair.ed ip jn the raore seemly and laboriosarens o co,uts the decisions of which it is the high .privilege of t+ e House of Lords to overrule. The grievance has beo`me intolerable, and, irrespective of any question Of p,erogative, irrespective of the pre.- judices of the Peer> for hereditary nobility of the anxiety of the lavwyem to mxaintain the dignit- of their craft, of the wish #f the Government to reniedy without legislativ6 awtion this canker, which eats into; the very heart of justice, this, poison, which adulterates its sweet waT,J at-their very fountaln head, wil -be and must be remadied. From this point the discussion sets out, to this 't must return, and by this test maust we assay everythling that is offered, if we wouild really comprehend the difficulty aud realy appreciate tlie possibility of a solution. On the question of law we cannot doubt that the Government has been well advised. - The, authorities establish the legality of peerages for life; and, on the other hand, there is nothing whatever to be urged, except a note of doubtfuI authorship and not very powerful reasoning, attributed, perhaps unjustly, to .- Mr. RABoRkvi; who, if one of the most learned, was also one of the most pedantic of men. The .rgumaent " from desuetude" is of the greatest force in. any case where the prerogatives of the Cuowi are brought into contact with popular rights; but in the matter of the peerage,T the creature and child of the prerogative, 3noulded and fashioned by the will of the Sov:Eror, which gives pre-emineube to some without taking away from the equal rights of the rest, these doctiines seem to have neither place nor application. It is beyond aispute that originally a peerage was considered susceptible of all the limitations incidental to a freehold estate, and, if the policy of one age had suggested one form, that is no reason why another should be illegal, any more than those forms of settlement which conveyancers have thrown aside as ill-adapted to] the wants of the present day. If, however, we tarn to the majority of the House of Lords we find in them a surprising neglect of the real interests of the public, and a strange m3isun derstandinv of the real bearings of the question. They cling to hereditary peerage, and argue against the law which is their safeguard, the prerogative of which they are the creatures, and the constitution which is their palladium, because they belove the power of tranmitig their dignities to their sons confers lustre and importance on their Order. They do not seem to observe that hereditary dignity is neither honourable to the peerage nor the individual, unless it be attended by hereditary wealth, anLd that nothing so infallibly rtuins a privileged class as that any large portion of its members should faR into poverty or social disrepute. They are offered the support of a class of men who -would adorn the debates and maintain the intellectual position of the House, without transmitting their position to descendants less useful and less influentidal than themselves, without coming in any degree into competition with the territorial and hereditary nobility. From their talents the hereditary nobles would derive lustre, and their merits would sustain the repute of a Chamber the energies of whose hereditary occupants wealth and ease are so continually undermining; and, worse than all, while intent on this peculiarly selfish view of the subject, the Peers tell the public, who care much less for dignity than for justice, that they must be content with the intolerable abuses of the appellate jurisdiction of the House of Lords as they stand, and that they will not lighten them with one of their fingers. Still more marvellous is the infatuation of the lawyers. Nothing is more melancholy in genersl than the history of the zuecession to law peerages -a topic siuceptible of ample illustration, were we to accept Lord LyimHutnsr's challenge, and enumuerate the melancholy instances of the degenerate, impoverislhed, and disreputable descendants of great lawyers whose names encumber the hereditary peerage. The family of a great lawyer is most frequently ill brought up; the father is immersed in business, the mother seldom equal to the position to which she is raised. 'When a great lawyer is offered a peerage, he has to consider whether his eldest son is worthy to succeed him, and whether, if he be, he will starve bis younger children to provide him with an estate suitable to the dignity. To such a man one would have supposed a peerage for life a most welcome refuge, but vanity carries it against prudence and modesty, and lawyers must transmit their titles to their posterity even while they are well assured that that posterity will disgrace them. We earnestLy hope, then, that Government wil not recede from the position it has taken up, will not allow the prerogative of the Cnoww to be -cut down and destroyed by the Chamber that is. its' creature and its offspring, nor permit the Peers to apply for the elevation and isolation of their Order those doctrines of prescription which have hithero only been used as the defence of therights andliberties of the gommons. Any one who considers how lage a portion of the busmess of the House of Lords is transacted by the first founders of peerag,es wil seethe necessity of infusing more of this element into that assembly. Life peerages may or may not render the House of Lords an efficient court of appeal, but they will, at any; rate, give to its debates weight and consideration' which the House can only otherwise purchabe atthe risk of impoverished descendants. As for. the judicial powers of the House of Lords, since| that House itself has so resolutely declared, against any attempt to palliate their inefficiency, and since, nevertheless, some speedy and. effcient cure must be applied, we would humbly. suggest that, while their Lordships are wrangling. over their dig-ty and privileges, a bill should. at onc be introduced, transferring the :ap_pellate jurisdiction of the House of Lord& to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,. thus relieving the peerage frora a duty which it cannot discharge and which it Wi not resign, the lawyers. from the dread of ernancipation from pauper peerages, and the suitors of our 'courts from a jurisdiction the scandal and disgrace of the judicial system of the country over which it presides.
The House of Commnons was employed last night in an elaborate and painful process of self-contemplation. It is the most industrious and the most multifarious law-making machine in thqg;-'!4 and that was the particular aspect p , t wasLi invited to consider itself. MI'r. N,,,PLu i*sexxtedL for the occasion, the Goddess of -1g,th holdmig the mirror to our 656 lawgivers; andtlt picture of ou' laws that he shows in that ,,ror is as multitudinous, discordant, contadi'ry, and chaotic as the veriest anarch would ire to see. L No doubt, with our three dng4oms, our three, or rather half-dozen kinds of Itaw, our host of lawgivers, and oar immenseeeumber of particular interests and instit tionslthat think themselves entitled to have laws niae at their own dictation, the result is a medley. A collection of all the unrepealed statutes w4ald ,ae a largepibrary, while a selection of wh2 is actually in force would only occupy a few shelVs But the evil advahce3 in an increasing r4g- Ir. NAPtr last night enumerated all tt °omplaints and proposals for reform tince the reigi°d Queen Ez/i; and it appears that at e,ri renewal -Q tO.l eomplaiat the grievance had become imneasely agg... Even last session added more than its share tb heap of confusion, and this session will probably-do the same. Legislation grows like a hideous nightnare which we. attempt to grasp and confine, but which only grows bigger and bigger still. It is the accumulated deposit of ages,. like the successive atrata of lava- or a guano island. -There are people who are too idle or too thrifty ever to take off thelr elothes, and when they get a new garmaent they put it on oteri the rest. Our Parliament puts- on new laws ove& the' old. Acts are thrust into the statute-book lid e- cursionists into a' railway carriage, to fina sitting room if they can. They are tola to "gort thenmselves," like the fifty pair of brides anJl bridegrooms who found themselves being i marri6j to the wrong person -in the church of some overgroW3n panih. That is exactly what-vre wish to be done. We want our laws sorted, but they will not sort themselves. They all stsnd or lie anyhow, as they were passed, Just as one sees dwellings standingihiggledy-piggledy in an oriental city, or like the famous stores at Thaladava. To paraphrase the fint line of Ponis epitaph on NEwToN, " England and England's la* lie hid, in "night." Till lately every lad who matriculated at Oxford had to swear that he wrould not play at marbles in the streets, sit ion Penniless Bench, or - wear . long hair, topboots, or a red coat. It is fortumnte that HER bJATEsY's subjects are not compelled to swear obedience to all the laws of the land, or they would find themselves lavishing their loyalty on similar absurdities, and it would be necessary to relieve the conscience with a salvo limiting obedience to the bounds of opportunity and knowledge. But what is to be done ? The failure of so many projects of amendment- seems to show that the evil is an inevitable result of national circnmstances. It i2 our boast that everybody is represented, and thvt all grievances are preveated from rising into insurrection or sinking into slaverg by being heard and legislated for. -It is the ambition of almost every one of our representatives to make a law, or to liave some hand in maling a law; indeed, the wish, of all others, that one hears most frequently expressed whereever one goes is that one could make a law for such. and such a purpose. Ladies, for examnple, ari always suggesting laws, and thiikldng it very hard that they have not the opportunity of getting them made. Every year there is a large crop of pampblets, resolutions at public meetings, and papers in one periodical or other, expressly for the suggestion of new laws. In fact, we are a law-making country. We don't make constitutions, and we are proud of leaving that to more theoretical. nations; bht we have a great addiction for particular laws and a great idea that it is a part of the noble British instinct to come out in this line. If our laws are redundant and conflicting, if we cannot stuff ali we want into the national portmanteau without some little damage, we are rather patient under a difficultywvhich proves at least the fertilityof our genius. It is only when our laws come to be viewed in the aggregate, to be used, and to be harmonized if possible, that they are found a vast mass of confusion. IHow is this state of things to be met ? Mr. NAPa talks of a code, without, however, recommending one. He looks writh fond regret to the Code of JiusTnuun ancd that of NRoox FOK; but both these men were despotic rulers, who could mak-e laws; and also compel them to proceed from one common centre, When we have a JUsTi" or a NAProLEo we may expect to have a code, though a long one, we should expect. The State of New York has a code in three octavo volumes ; but even a republic is a simpler affair than our own delightfully complex and well-balanced Constitiution. Anyhow,j 3Mr. NAPrIR does not venture to propose a code. His remedy is to begin with the Legislature itself,- and provide some internal regulation to its legislative action. In newly constructed machines it is often found that the several parts will not work well together,-that the movexnents counteract one another, and that force is lost, while the wok 'is not done. No doubt, it is just so in this case. Parliament is always making work for the lawyers, and the lawyers for Parliament. Now, there is a well-known story of a boy in a nill who, being rather idle, discovered a dodge which did his work for hiim, and gave hiim leisure to sleep safely. By the judicious application of a piece of cord he I made one part of the machine he had to watch do his work upon the other. It appears to us that is what Mr. NArPa has in view. He wishes to open a correspondence and establish a better understandingbetweenlawyers and legislators, sothat the forner may applytheir criticism on the action of Parliament before it becomes law. What the lawyers will say to the project we do not venture to guess. They may consider the House of Commons made to find them vwork and the House of Lords to give thenm a goal for their ambition; and any attempt to get their opinion beforehand they may possibly regard as aninfraution of craft law. Mfr. NAriim did, indeed, propose a Department of Justice, to initiate, compare, and correct bills for Parliament. But even this was too much for the popular prejudice. There are few thiDgs so disagreeable to an Englishman as the abstract idea of a Department and a Minister. We have, it is true, our A1nister of War, and now a Mlinister of the Poor Laws; but the proposal of a 'inister of Public Justice met with scant favour last night,-possibly because it seemed to: lead to other Ministries. Government rep>sented as much the sentiment of the peat unthinking mass as it did its own c'ifort in stipulating for the omission of the word.' " for " an efficient and responsible .departI.ei of "justice " for such -a department it might not be able to form in a hurry. .So all the debate came to was the confession that sometILflg or other ought to be done; that provision should be made to secure the sklfl pyrepa.locn and proper structure of bills, and promo4e the- progressive amendment of the laws. Wulses of this sort have been espressed by p"rIhament a thousand times without comingto ar3ything, and we doubt whether we are nearer a BTpplification and digest of our laws than we were-Yesterday- The question of the means Ias yet t,-be answeted. In this country there 'will alwqYs be a jealousy of any board that pretends te anticipate the decisions of Parliament, and teX it its duty. It was but a few years ago that ..jr RonsT Puns himself instigated, the 1zouse of Commons to rebel against the Railway Board, created -to provide some kind of rules and data for the House to go upon. - With afew words of scorn he demolished the.labours of an able and meritorious body of men, and, left t'he House of Commons at the mercy of gamblers, jobbers, and every class that preys on the public. Will anybody say that the House of Commons would not soon be in arms against a -lIinister of Justice or any functionary who told it how to ma3ke bills, and what bils should or should not be made ? Then, what " provision" is possible ? Unless the House can be brought to the point, and this question be answered, Mr. NArxms's move is lost, a debate thrown away, and another layer of bills, like one more layer of bodies in a London churchyard, will be deposited upon our mountain of heigislation. _,.
A few nights since Iorc PTmRosToN. aadaessei the rIouse on the differences that have arien vith America. lu answer to Mr CoLDmN'a urgLuneats =ie gave to the world a statement of the rise and i nit state of the aispute, Una appealed to his *!2 ts j,,r ajistifjcation which will hardly :be F I "1e1d. . t;li rospect to the affairs of- Central Z. -v 'vhat is well known to be the America Q hatel .. se treaty concluded -was to fact, that the spirit of . of territory by either prevent further acquisitiont * Eng-land has long of the contracting Powers. -A. -rtance on this possessed a colony of more orless im,lv to refer to coast, her Ministers understooathetreat ' further settlements, and not to those alrea z The lUnited States took a differeni vie ws an demnanded the immediate evacuation oI the territory we' liad fancied secured to u*s. .cr wa a .umcuity somewhat hard to be overcorme "but," sa&y Lord PA!XFnsrTD, " we have offered "to refer the natter to arbitration." Whatever may be the generAl opinion as to the merits of this mode of decision, it at least shows good faith ii the party that proposes it, and the declaration of Lord PArrnsroN was received wvith applause by an assembly which, while jelous for its own country's dignity, is not unmindfdl of what is due to the spirit of peace. With. equal frankness did the British Puumnn point out the incidents of the second dispute. We: are Threatened with a suspension of international relations. Theotwobranches of the Anglo-saxot race will only correspond officially by means of a consul, or, at most, a secretary. Possibly no great harm may arise from a short ceation of diplo. mnatic activity, but the cause of this imutual interdict, and not the thing itself, is of grave importance. Such an interruptiOn is generaly looked upon as approaching nearly to a state of hostilit-r. In fact, in such a case everything las been done which usually precedes the first irrevocable blowthe great letting out of the waters of strife. The House then listened -with attention to the words of the First Minister. He stated that in the directions for the enlistment in Canada strict orders were given that nothing should be done to infringe the municipal regulations of the States or violate the laws of the Union. He added, moreover, that when it was found this enlistment might cause offence to the American Government and people, orders were given for its cessation, and this before any remonstrance was received. When official representations were made complaining of an alleged infringement of American law, theBritish Goverment expressed its regret at once and without reserve. Lord P?sianissoh thus explicitly stated that his Government first did all that it could to avoid giving offence, and when charged with discourtesy promptly apologized. This declaration -was received with cheers by the British House of Commons. The temper of the Government and the national representatives was fully evinced at this sitting. The feelingr of the public we believe we have expressed, and it fally coincides with that of the 1inistry and the Commons. A sincere desire for peace, a wish to make any honourable concession, a regret that any alleged act of ours should have caused a difficulty between the two countries, animates all classes and will determine their futute conduct. Turn now to America. From the Five Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico we believe no thinking American fails to perceive that, if his country be brought into hostilities vwith our own, the Central American affair and the Recruitingoffice are not motives but pretexts. To the few, principally immigrants, or children of immigrants, who detest England and look forward to a struggle I with satisfaction, we shall not speak. But of the mass of Americans we wouid ask, whether their Government can disturb the peace of the world in these disputes without incurring the just reprobation of every free nation? Caa it be denied that these matters migt be settled at once if it were the wish of one or two men at Washington to settle them ? Can it be denied that even in. the Pnxsrnmrs Cabinet some moderate politicians are overborne by the recklessness of colleagues who wish to gain popularity at the expense of the nationas peace? We believe that the Ministers of President PRceM are divided in their convictions ancd their motives of action. The following is said to be the state of parties. The AttorneyGeneral, Mr. CAig:Cusimw, has been the leading spirit in these differences. He is said not to object to war, or at least to such an approach to it as may give him popularity and a reputation for high spirit throughout the States. As a law officer of the Government his language should have been cautious and his conduct moaerate; howv far both have fallen short of such an ideal we may judge from the letters bearing his signature that have appeared in print. EL:. Cusniw has much influence with the PIsnEmmsar, and they are probably bound together by an identity of political objects. It is stated that Mr. !ithxcy, the Secretary of 3?e is opposed to the warlike demonstrations of his colleague and his chief. If the settle- ment of these disputes depende.4< dii lhim and| the B3ritish Minister, mattci:- vould not long remain unarranged. T} I - prolonged stay of Mr. CnA&srrox in Was: .'gton is said to be due to his moderation. Yv,;"the present state of affairs seems to be, t M&Ucyr. 3fruc has so far yielded as to join in the i1.spatch of a positive demand for Mr. Ca_a, -.-u's recall. The Dtrsnursr and ATTorNE'x5hL -wished the demand to be categ, l and so to necessitate a rupture, bit lJlr. ZkAcy is said to have prevailed so far as to fmine it in a manner which will allow of further rorrespondence. We have thus a proof of the temper which riles the men on whom the destinies of the two nations for the time depend. From this description of affairs, whichl we believe to be correct, it is impossible not to draw a conclusion in favour of our own Government. We are the less reserved in doing so, because the worst that can be said against their own politicians always comes from the lips, of Americans. It is no invention of the British press that Senators and Secretaries of State are ready to bring their nation to the brink of war in order to prolong their own power or embarrass their successors. Even the phrase "political capital," which so well expresses what is gained by such courses, is not of English origin. The debate in the Senate, Mwhich was in progress when the last steamer left, will probably be full of the usual invectives against England. The antipathies of the old and the enthusiasm of the younger speal-ers will both find vent in defiance to this country. The American public, we learn, is pretty well awvare of what each speaker will say, and we are happy to believe that some of the most acrimonious will have but little vweight.. Yet it cannot be doubtecl that the accusations will be many, and thc, apologies few. We pannot, however, but think that such an exixbition will lessen the character of the American Senate by its strong coutrast to. the mnoderation and good sense of our own represeutatives. Even in the opinion of Americans those mca must sink who talk of war only thlue&h a belief that their words wfi be without eIct, anh wvho, perhaps, are only suffered so to deelaimi by the indifference of their countrmuen.; feethat schli paltry dispuEtes should involve two suc3 wationsin a stungglevhich wvould be fou;ght out uevery S03, w cannot believe. Although it dot lessen-the demerit of those.>who tamper with -international goodwill, yet we, in conunni with alumost all Englishmen, think that the bonds of a common language and civilizatioz. are too strong-to be broken by a dis-nsion. to which uine-teiftls on boti sides of the Atlnntic are totally indifferent. Not through any fear of war, for Eigland was never SD strong, or so well prepared as -now, but from sincere love of peace ana its i4estimable benefits, we-tra that American sthtesmen will be actuated. by the same Spirit which our owi' rulers have slown.

We have received the following teleg,raphic deSpatch from our Paris correspondent:- " PARIS, WIDN-SDAY, FM. 13, 8.30 A.U._ "Baron Brunow arrived here last night, at halfpsSt 10 o'clock, at the Russian Embassy." EXPRESS FROM PARIS. The following is the letter of our Paris corre. spondent, dated yesterday, 6 p.m. - There are two private telegraphic despatches in Snis afternoon; one states that Baron Brunow w11 arrive in Paris the day after to-morrow: Lord Clsrendon, M. de Buol, and M. de Cavour, on the 25th; and Count Orloff on the 19th. The other .affirms that Baron Brunow actually left Strasburg - this morning, and will arrive here to-night. We Ahall soon see which is the correct one. "Peace" is still the word in most people's mouths; but I doubt whether everybody is so sanguine as a week or tw-o since, that the peace about to be made will be as solid and as durable as is desired. On this point there is a difference of opinion among men whose opinion is nevertheless entitled to re* pect. I have repeatedly recorded the sentiments of the confident and the sanguine; I may now say a vword about the feelings of the diffident. The Emperor is vcry anrxous to be enabled to announce to his Senate aud Legislative Corps on the 3d of next nonth that peace is made. That grand solution, and another event which is hoped to follow happily oorn after, will fill the measure of his joy. Yet there are some who say it is a pity. that She good work is not carried farther; and that the 300 and odd war ships of every size and power, which, without diminishing our 31ack Sea squadron, we could let loose into the 33altic,-that these 300 and odd ships, and the enormous expense incurred in makinog them -what they are, should go for nothing so far as Bussia is concerned. They maintain that the war was begun not merely to wrest Turkey from the clutches of Russia, but to render it impossible tat the tranquillity and independence of the rest *of Europe shall for a long timc be disturbedand taey doubt whether more than half our task is accomDlished. It will perhaps be considered .iceitisnm, but it is certain that not a few think that the peace of the Paris Conferences will be a peace 'rithout repose-the most unsatisfactory, the most ainhealthy condition, by the way, into which a people can fall. They fear that there are too many evil passions floating darldy in the air, and which, like the curse which has once issued from human lips, maust fall sooner or later somewhere, on the innocent or on the guilty; that there is too much rancour, too tauch international distrust, too keen a remeniJrance of bad words, which a Spanish proverbtells us are even worse than evil actions, to allow Europe to eonfide in the future, or enjoy the delight of the repose which is proniised us. You must know better than I can whether it be true or not, that it is with ;ullen assent rather than with heartfelt joy that this result of the war is received in England. France is indeed content with her military glory, and the feeling is not perhaps di:minished by the share we have had of it; biut we are painfully reminded that there are some great social qunstions remaining which are not yet resolved. We are told that the war has itirred up a great deal without having settled anything ; that, whatever some of your statesmen mnz.y say to the contrary, the allies have given Murkey (as a nation of Turks) her death-blow; sund that we shall yet have to invent some process of metempsychosis by which the soul of the " sick mnan" ia to pass into some new body, composed of more healthy and homogeneous materials. Baron de Bourqueney, the French Ambassador at Vienna, left that capital on the 7th for Paris. On his arrival at Dresden on Friday evening AIL. de Bourqueney waited on the Minister, Dr. de Beust, ,who immediateTy returned his visit. The French Ambassador took his departure from Dresden in the _afernoon of Saturday. The French frigate Virginie, bearing the flag of 'Iear-Admiral Guerin, was at Mfacao on the 12th December LIast. The Admiral was to mail in that rigate for the Philippine Islands in the flrstdy of January. The frigate Sibylle was undergoing repairs at Hongkong on the 6th December, anDd waa afterwards to join Rear-Admiral Guerin at 31anilla. The steam aviso Marceau left the island of Reunon on the 15th of November for Pondicherry, whence she was to sail for Manilla.. The 'war corvette Constantine was expected at 31acao early in December; that corvette was at Hokadadi, ln Japan, on the 4th of December last. The steam corvette Colbert was to leave the China Seas towards the close of December, on her way home to 3France. The health of the crews of all those mhips was excellent, notwithstanding the rigour3 of it long cruise. , General de Martimprey has left Paris for the Crimea, to resume his post of Chief of the Staff of 3Narshal Pelissier's army.

There are few facts of political importance to be conununicated, but authentic information, this morning received, wMl enable me to give you a tolerably correct idea of what is likely to be done at Paris a fortnight hence. It is very generaLly believed that the preliminaries of peace will be signed as soon as the Peace Conferences begin, but there is good reason for supposing that such will not be the case. The 'Western Powers and Austria desire that the fundamental conditions of peaeo should be as precise as possible, and few persons who have attentively read the propositions recently accepted by Russia can have failed to remark that the sense of certain passages in them is somewhat obscure. England wil naturally wish to give greater precision to the fifth proposition, and this Govermunent may desire to make some slight changes in the others. In short, it is highly probable that the five points will be subjected to a very strict revision before they are accepted by the various members of the Conference as the irreversible bases of the futLre negotiations for peace. The armistice, which wil not be concluded until the preliminaries of peace are signed, will hardly be for a longer tern than a month or five weeks. What the future will bring forth is naturally aslittleknowntomeas to the restof the world, buit my sources of information are so various that it is not difficult for me to foretell what kindof interpretation will ultimately be given to the fifth point. Austria, who wvas formerlyat the feet of Russia, has now thrown herself into the arms of France, and. therefore the representatives of England would be likely to find themselves in a minority should they I ittempt to make a sine Ted non of the disarmIng of the eastern coast of the Black Sea. It is my conviction that Count Buol and Ml de Bourqueney have come to a perfect understanding wvith each other in respect to the interpretation to be given to the fifth point, and the sequel will, loubtless, show that my judgment is not greatly at Fault. France and Austria are Ekely to go with England in the matter of the non-fortification of tho Aland Isles, and they will positively insist on Rnssia's admitting Consuls to all her ports in the BLack Sea*, but neither the one nor the other considers the razing of the Russian forts on the east coast of the Black Sea " a measare re. quired by the interests of Europe." The maintenance of the status gtuo on the Circassian coast may meet with the approval of our aUies, but more is hardUy to be obtained from them. The foregoing opinions, which are based on perfectly reliable information, have been given in order that the British public may be aware of the difficulties with which the Earl of Clarendon and Lord Cowley wiU have to contend when they eiter the diplomatic arena on or about the 21st inst. When it is remembered that Count Buol and Baron Bourqueney were not only the authors of the first four gmarantee points, bat of the second, it will not appear strange that they should look with an unpropitious eye on the fifth condition, which first saw the light of day in Downing-street. When one sees how much Austria has gained by her demonstrations, and how very little real profit England and France will derive from their lavish expenditure of blood and money, one is greatly inclined to fancy that the two Powers last mentioned are much more formidable opponents in the field than in the council-chamber. The diplomatic victory which Austria has gained is so - that it is no wonder she is inclined to over-es?.. ate herself, and look with pity on her " disinter&t-" friends in the West. At the very beginning of ->,Ioar you were told that Austria could not compiutad how England and France could be so Quixotic a 'o declare beforehand that they renounced all claim to --y material advantage at the expense of Russia. :e t£,,n understood thing that no indemnification is to &eglaid by Russia, as Austria feels sure that such a demlk4 would lead to a prolongation of the war. It iF ' ispered here that Austria has agreed to give her4t (-<irt to the Emperor Napoleon should hedemand "J 7lment of that convention of 1815 which ei ,1 the family of Napoleon L from the throne , ->. Count Leo Thun, the MIinister for Eciesiastica Affairs, still carries on a wordy war with the Italian. Bishops, but those independent dignitaries do not, deign to take any notice of the complaints of their former benefactor. A Professor Stein has published a series of articles " On the Bases of the Future Peace," and the tenth of them contains a piece of interesting and useful information. Trebizond, from its geographical position, cannot but become a place of great importance to the mercantile world, and a safe harbour may be formed there at a comparatively trifling expense. The Greeks and Romans, who were fully aware of the advantages of the position of. Trebizond, constructed enormous moles in its roads behind which their ships rode at anchor in safety. The Turks allowed the upperpart of these moles or piers. tofallto decay, but the foundations are so firm that a superstructure might be raised on them with equal ease and safety. The ten articles by x. Stein may possibly contain a great deal more desirable information, but they are so heavy as to be indigestible for any one who has not been accustomed to listen to the lectures of long-winded German professors. The Ost-Dutsdhe Post make3merry at the expense of the ilustrious members of the German Diet. It is announced to the world " that the committees of the late German Empire will take into serious consideration the preliminaries of peace, while the Power3 assembled at Paris are settling the affairs of Europe." The Vienna organ of the press counsels the "patres Con5scipt' to dothebusiness thoroughly while they are about it, as by so acting they will prove themselves true Germans. As 3L de Bourqueney dismissed some of his servantsbeforehe left for Paris, areport isin circulation that he wi in future be employed in that city, but it is certainly devoid of all foundation. CountBuol gives his last diplomatic soiree to-morrow evening. * By Austrian statesmen Nicolaieff is not considered a Black Sea port. Colonel Manteuffel returns to Berlin next week. On the 4th, the Austrian General von Parrot, who was accompanied by two Colonels, two Majors, and two Captains, arrived at Warsaw, "in order, as the representative of the Austrian army," to be present at the funeral of Field-Marshal Prince Paskswitsch. The Militar Zeiung learns from Eakshiserai that the news of the coming armistice had produced a great sensation in the Russian army, as preparations were being made for " alarming" the advanced posts of General Autemarre's division. The attack, which was to have been made by way of Janisale andKoluluz was naturally countermanded. On the 23d January the order which had been given to reinforce Lieutenant-General Vagner,nearKertch, was countermanded. The fire from the northern forts has entirely ceased, and the troops beforo Eupatoria have fallen back on Tulatt. The Patriarch of Venice has ordained that, " in order to avoid unpleasantness (scandal), all those persons who do not fast on the appointed fast days are to be served in a private room." RUSSIA. We have received the St. Petersburg journals of the 5th inst. The Joumnal de St. Pde,r,1ourq has the following official announcement of the appointment of Prince Gortschalkoff to the post left vacant by the death of Prince Paskewitsch - "In consequence of the demise of the Marshal Prince of Warsaw, Count Paskiwitsch of Erivan, Aide-de-Camp General Prince Gortschakoff IL, member of the Council of tho Empire, is appointed Conmmander-in-Chief of the armies of the West and Centre, and lieutenant of the Kingdom of Poland, with all the attaibutes and prerogatives belonging to that office." INDIA. We have received our private correspondence and files of papers from Calcutta of the 8th January, and from Bombay to the 16th January. Our Bombay correspondent, writing on the 16th, says,- " The insurrection among the Santals is at length completely quelled, and the force employed in its suppression has been broken up. A proclamation has been issued by the Government announcing these facts, and conveying the thanks of the civil authorities to the officers employed on the service. " With regard to the future destiny of the kingdom of Oude, and its annexation to the territories, or administration 'by the authorities, of the British Empire, nothing certain is as yet known. It is, however, reported that, as has been previously asserted with confidence, the latter alternative is the one about to be adopted, and that a letter of the Governor-General to that effect has been already presented to the King by the officer who had been officiating as Resident during the absence of General Outram. The Sovereign, it is said, received the miission that announced his coming degradation with womanish tears and lamentations, and the usual expressions of Oriental fatalism. The same report further states, that among the people of Lucknow the universal feeling was one of satisfaction at the prospect of a change from the existing regime, and that even the troops, though aware that they would be disbanded and reorganized under a sterner discipline, were well content, as certain of receiving their arrears of pay. It may be doubted, however, whether all is likely to go off as quietly as these accounts would lead us to expect. At any rate, it would appear that the Government, if not seriouslyl apprehensive of resistance, is determined to be upon its guard. " A telegraphic message from Calcutta, received yesterday, notifies the prevalence of a report that aU furloughs were about to be stopped, and that officers on leave were to be ordered to rejoin at once, and the general belief that the adoption of these measures was referable to designs upon Oude. MIoreover, the latest number of the D'lhi Gazefte that has reached us-the paper of the 8th-announces that the 12th Native Infantry had received orders by electric telegraph to march at once from Delhi to Cawnpore, and that Her Majesty's 52d and the 36th Native Infantry had in like manner been ordered from Meerut to the same destination. Al these corps had either actually started by the 8th, or were on the point of doing so. The movements of regiments on the annual relief will be so arranged as further to increase the force which will be ready to act in the event of its services being required. "While the plains of Bengal are no longer wasted by lawless savages, or traversed by an avenging soldiery, and in Oude intestine warfare is stiled, and the approach of the British power awaited in silence at least, if not with joy-while indeed all India is profoundly tranquil-in the little State of Oodeypore alone does there appear cause to apprehend disturbances. " The award of Sir Henry Lawrence, who, as I have before mentioned, was constituted arbitrator by Lord Dalhousie, when requested by the unanimous application of the Maha Rana on one side, and the recusant chiefs on the other, to mediate between them, has been made publc, and has given rise to much discussion of the kind I alluded to in a former letter. It is asserted that by the provisions of the document the Maha Rana is coerced and virtually deprived of his sovereignty, in favour of the British. This, however, is not apparent upon the faceof the award, nordoesit seem likely toresult from its operation. That we are bound by treaty to interfereforthesettlementof suchdisputeswhencalled upontodo so is certain; that, during thepasthalf. century our interference has been frequently asked for is no less so. The rights of each of the contending parties appear on this, as on previous occasions, :,o have been carefully looked after. If the award ~?esses heavily upon either, it is upon the chiefs, :,ier than upon their sovereign; and such would see.' S, be the opinion of some of that body, from wh'- Rsfusa to affix their signature to the document it 5 that an outbreak of civil war is thought not to K improbable. In support of the Maha Rana, and ss ameasure of prevention, or, if necessary, of supP, qion, the brigade of Bombay troops at Nusserabadlis about to receive an accession of strength by the dcle ,th from Deesa of a wing of the 83d and some a rsk with native cavalry and infantry.I "By the latest accounts ?rom Peshawur, all was quiet on the frontier. "From Cabal itself we' ve nothing further than an assertion, professing i be made on good authority, that the Dlost has no ir: sTtion whatever of takng possession of Candahar-,st, on the contrary, he has most earnestly urged of.; brothers and nephews, the Sovereigns of Southern Affgt.@ tan, the advisability of joining him in resisting th1i, move made by the Persians on Herat, and that the Candahar chiefs are disposed to agree to the propositions of the Ameer. This is confirmatory of what I have written to you in previous letters, and is credible as being obviously the best policy the Dost could adopt at the present juncture. His plans on Candahar may bide their time, but there is danger imminent on the frontier, which may call for the employment ofthe united forces of the kingdom. E" Of Burmese intelligence the principal item is a disastrous fire at Rangoon on the 10th December, resulting in so great a destruction of property as to amount to absolute ruin of the native trade of that rising town. With few exceptions it is said that the whole body of Mogul merchants are reduced to a state of bankruptcy. The origin of the fire is not known. It broke out in the neighbourhood of the jail, and the exertions of the Europeans proving fnitless in consequenfice of a want of water (the Bnrmese stood by idly), it soon destroyed 14 brick warehouses and a great number of buildings and houses of lighter construction. The. whole amount of damage done is variously estimated at from 30,0001. to 150,000. "AtCalicut, the Sub-Collector, Mr. Collett, has well nigh completed his investigation regarding Mr. Conoley's murder. No fewer than 300 Moplas, ineluding men, women, and children, have, we are told, been placed in confinement, as more or less implicated in the recent tragedy. Among them are two chiefs of the tribe, to whom, or to. one of whom, tho crime of having harboured the murderers and otherwise aided theni has it is said been fully brought home. This man, and any others against whom sufficient evidence is lkely tobeforthcomning, will be committed to the Session Court for trial, and with regard (says the .3adras Spectator) to the others, in whose cases there is not.ample legal proof, the magistracy will, we are informed, be empowered to take such steps as may be deemed requisite to ensure a certain prevention of the misdeeds which there is no moral doubt these men have been guilty of. " By the last mail steamer. from Aden intelligence was received of a serious insurrection having taken place at Judda and Mocha, the well-known ports on the Red Sea. The Arab tribes of the interior had risen and forced the Turkish soldiery to take refuge in the towns. The English Consul at Judda sent offadespatch to the political agent at Aden, informing him of the occurrence and requesting any aid that it might be in his power to give to our Turkish allies. The requisition was forwarded to Bombay and the war steamer Queen has sailed for the Red Sea. She carries no other troops than a small detail for. Aden, it being thought probable that ner appearance would be sufficient to bring the reiractory Arabs to their senses. " The contractor for the portion of the Bombay and Poonah Railway that lies between the latter town and the top of the Bore Ghaut has arrived in this country and begins operations immediately. Some of his staff are already posted at different points of the line. The engineering difficulties, as compared with those below the Ghaut, will be insignificant, and it has often been matter of surprise why the works were not sooner commenced in the Deccan, while the line has been slowly struggling throughthe Concan. The portion undertaken by the new contractor is to be completed by April, 1858. " Lord Elphinstone is expected to-day on his return from his toiur in Guzerat and Kattiware. During his short visit to Ahmedabad scarcely a day passed without bringing to the notice of the Governor some fresh instance of the liberality of the wealthy native families in the cauise of social improvement and education. A new building was to be erected at the expense of arich trader for the Native Library and Museum. Of this Lord Elphinstone laid the first stone. So with a hospital munificently endowed by the bequest of another merchant prince. Then there were prizes to be distributed to two girls' schools similarly founded, and complimentary visits to be paid to their founder and to the other leading benefactors of the place, who, in honour of their guest, poured forth their rupees afresh in support of existing or contemplated charitable schemes. " Lord Canning is expected here about the 26th, the Feroze having been ordered to be in readiness at Suez on the 12th, and it is expected will spend a week with Lord Elphinstone before proceeding to Calcutta. Sir Wiliam Gomm, the Commander-inChief of India, is also coming down to Bombay by way of the Indus and Kurrachee, and was by the last accounts in the Lahore districts. He will be succeeded by General Anson early next month, upon which he will at once leave the Upper Provinces. " Little or no change has taken place in the state of the markets, and the sales, though moderately numerous, have been at very low prices. Money has become tighter, and further raising of the rate of discount by the Banks is anticipated. xchange on England has continued to advance, and pubici securities have experienced a further decline, the Five per Cent. Public Works Loan being at 1 discount, and the Four per Cents. at S3." Our Calcutta correspondent, writing on the 8th of January, says,- " We have received details of the great fire which broke out on the 10th December in Rangoon. Its origin is unknown, but in a few hours it had spread over all the Mohammedan quarter, and swept down about 150 houses and 18 large warehouses. The property destroyed amounts to about 200,0001. sterling. It belonged chiefly to the Mogul mer chants, most of whom are ruined, but the loss will fall with the greatest severity on the European merchants, who cannot hope to realize their outstanding accounts from the foguls. The people, it is said, showed the greatest possible apathy. WVater could not be procured in sufficient quantities, and no practical effort was made to check the flames. So say my letters, but I have seen these Burmese towns, and I can readily imagine that human effort was whollyunavailing. The houses are of old dry wood. The floors are laid on upright posts five or six feet from the ground. There is a free current of air underneath, and when the flames had once got hold nothing short of pulling down whole streets could check them. For this desperate expedient there was no time. The Commissioner of the province was present and worked hard, but without result. " The Bank of Bengal has declared a dividend of 20 per cent. You could have no better indication of the state of the money market in Calcutta. The Bank is prohibited from dealing in exchanges. Its profits, therefore, depend almost entirely upon its loans and discounting business. It demands always a high rate of interest. It leaves always a very broad margin on the securities placed in its hands. It is consequently by no means the most popular resource for obtaining accommodation. So enormous a dividend therefore indicates a tightness of the market almost unprecedented. One of the most practical merchants in Calcutta told me yesterday he saw little chance of any diminution of the current rate of interest. The usury laws also ceased to be operative on the 1st inst., and the fact has not tended to lower the market price of money." COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. CALCUTTA MARKETS.

Yesterday, at 8 in the evening, M. de Bourqueney, who during the two preceding days had Eeveta times conferred with Count Buol, left Vienna for Paris. Count Buol starts for the French capital on Tuesday, the 12th, and purposes passing a day with some members of his faraily who reside at Mannheim, in the Grand Duchy of Baden. The members of the AustrianMinister's suite are-Baron MIeysenbug, M. de Kletzl, 3I de Werner (a nephew of the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs), and Count Kalman Szechenyi. As you were led to expect would be the case, Count Rechberg, as the representative of Austria, yesterday invited the Bund to give its adhesion to the conditions which form the basis of the approaching negotiations for peace. Being feeble and dastardly, the German Diet is fond of evasion and subterfuge, and therefore, instead of entering at once into the proposal of the representative of Austria, it referred it tothe political and military committees of the Bund. Ats has already been stated,there islittloornochanceofAustriaandPrussia going hand-in-hand in the Eastern question, but it is evident that the Berlin Cabinet has some object which it is particularly desirous to attain, for Colonel Manteuffel, whose mission istothe Sovereign, hasrecently been a daily visitor at the Foreign-office. Perfectly authentic information relativetotheactualstate of things in Russia is of such great importance at the present moment that it may be woll here to state that Russia is far more exhausted by the prodiglous exertions which she has made during the hst two years than is generally supposed. The person from whom the information was received expressly stated,. "that if Russia had risked a third campaign, her internal weakness would have become so evident, that the allios wouild certainly have made very different conditions of peace." RUSSIA. (FROiM OtR BERLIN CORIRESPONDENT.) BERLIK, FEB. 10. The I7uralide has published in detail the re- port drawn up by Admiral Glasenapp as to the i construction of the row gunboats now building in Russia. In the course of this description we are made acquainted with the new weapons which the Russians have had made for the purpose of repelling boarding attacks. They are represented as consisting of an iron lance, about seven feet long, and a mace of cast iron, the massive head of which resembles a pineapple, and like it is beset with a number of obtuse but pointed projections. Each boat is provided with from 30 tD 40 lances and from 1i to 20 maces, in the management of which the Fins are said to possess great skL From this description these maces would appear to resemble the niorgenstecr7, still in use with the watchmen in Sweden, andw with one of which the Mfarquis of Waterford some 15 years back came inconveniently into close contact. The Minister of War, Prince Dolgorouki, announced the same day as Prince Pasliewitsch died 'shat the Emperor had ordered the obsequies of the deceased to be observed with appropriate honours. These latter appear to have been, in conformity with the intentions of the late Emperor, almost the honours due to a member of the ImperialFamily, as, for instance, mourning to be worn for him by the whole army, and also a general mourningthroughout Poland. On the 4th inst. the remains of the do- 'eased were conveyed from .the saloon to the chapel of the palace, on which occasion the clergy, the military, and the civil emvl&y&s of the State were very numerous in their attendance. The coffin itself was csried by the persons of highest rank then present, and the pall was borne by officers of the Cossack regiment that had formed the Prince's body guard in his lifetime. After the body had been placed in the chapel, the Archbishop of Warsaw, Arsenins, performed a service for the dead. According to the wish of the deceased, his mortal remains will be interred in the family vault in the village Ivanouka, which lies in the immediate neighbourhood of the fortress of Ivangorod, and they will be escorted thither by 'the entire Cossack regiment mentioned above; previous to which, however, the body will be deposited with all pomp in the church of the Holy Trinity on the 8th instant. The procession from the palace to the church will be divided into 10 separate divisions and proceed through a double line of mlilitary, and be accompanied by the booming of artillery. On the part of the Prussian army, Colonel von Bosse, Captain von} der Golts, anzd Lieutenant von Berken had arrived in Warsaw for the purpose of being present at the ceremonies, on the part of Austria, General von Parrot and a deputation of officers. The death of Prince Pasldewitsch is stated to remove the last obstacle that stood in the way of great changes in the administration of the kingdom of Poland; one chief feature of this plan, on which the present Emperor is said to lay great stress, is, that his favourite brother, Nicholas, should assume the post of Viceroy, from the duties nnd responsibilities of which, however, the young rand Duke is said to draw backawith diffidenceand apprehension. It is understood here (Berlin) that the persoi-sd of the Russian Embassy in this capital is soon to be inereased by the addition of a member well versed in the mechanical arts, whose office it shall be to make himself acquainted with every improvement in mechanism and the useful arts as fast as it appears, and report upon it to his Government. For some time past the endeavours of the Russian Government to improve the manufacturing arts at home have been made very evident here by the numerous purchases of models that have been made from prussian mechanicians; and. one hears the very confident expectation expressed on many sides, that as soon as a peace is concluded this place will be very richly favoured with Russian orders for engines and machlinery; the mere sgning of preliminaries has given rise to a great numbor of preparatory inquiries, wvhich are looked on as the sure forer.unners of orders.

'he English funds show continued buoyancy; and have closed at a further considerable advance. Consols for money, which left off yesterday at 91g, were first quoted 9l0 to , and, a general disposition having been manifested to effect purchases, a rie took place to 91~ to J, which, after some fluctuations, was the pnce at the offical termninati6n of business. For the account the last regular quota-. tion was 92i to i,but there were subsequently buyers at 921. The money-market was without alteration, and there was no foreign news to exercisc influence, except that the letters from New-York are of a satisfactory and conciliatory character.

The final quotations of the French Three per Cents. on the Paris Bourse this evening were 73f. for money and 73f. 75c. for the end of the month, showing a fresh advance of three-quarters p)er cent. in consequence of a renewal of speculafive purchases. At Vienna there has been a rise of nearly one and a-half percent., but at Amsterdam the stock-market remains without animation. A new Bank has been announced, to be foundedat Constantinople, and to be called the Ottoman Bank, with a capital of 500,0001. in 207. shares. The board includes members of leading London banking establishments, and the chairman is Mr. Layard, M.P. The continental advices continue to describe a very favourable tendency in all the rates of exchange. At the same time, the general demand for money is unabated, the charge for discount atTaitbrg having advanced to 5& per cent., while at Paris nothig can be obtained below the B;Ank termns. The draughts of the Tipperary Joint-Stock Bank have been returned by their London agents, Messr. Glyn. This company wias established in 1838, with a head office at Clonmel, and branches at Athy, Carlow, Carrick-on-Suir, Kenagh, Poscr_a, Thurles, Thomastown,. and Tipperary, and has been paying dividends at the rate of 6 per cent. The commercial aCmunts from the United States to-day describe an easier condition of the moneymarket and a great increase of confidence with regard to political relations with England. Securities of most kinds, however, were dull, owing to the decline reported from this side, the news of the submission of Russia not having yet arrived out. A week previously the aspect of foreign affairs had been considered bad, but it had become evident that the attempt to create a war feeling had not been responded to by the public; and the satisfactory effect thus caused had been greatly strengthened by a semi-official statement in the Wifash:gtomb VLiOn, that the whole of the reports lately in circulation as to the intention of the President to adopt an offensive course were wholly vithout foundation and highly injurious to the commercial iterests of the nation. The rate of discount for the best paper had declined to e8 per cent., and there was a tendency to an advance in the rate of exchang"e, which holds out the prospect that a moderate resumption of specie remaittances to this side may take place in the course of a few weeks. Erie RaUroad Stock was at 5SMr; Panama, 1001; Reading, 851; and Ilinols Central Bmds, 811. A long period of severe weather had retardled business, but the importation of British goods had been comparatively large, and the transactions generaly were of a healthycharacter. Wheat andflour had experienced a rise equal to about Is. 8d. per quarter. The Governor of MIississippi had issued his message to the Legislature of that State, recommending the appropriation oI $200,000 annually for the encouragement of railroads, but saying nothing about its debts either as regards the amount repudiated or the amount acknowledged but not paid. He is accordingly reminded by the NZew York Tribune that, although M1ississippi greatly needs railroads, she needs common honesty still more. From California later advices had been received, but they contain no intelligence beyondthe fact of a continued increase in the gold production. The MIexican accounts are likewise without anything of much moment; but from Hayti a full confirmation had been received of the utter rout of the Emperor Soulouque and his army of 30,000 men in their attempt to subjugate the Dominican part of the island. The portion of the expedition headed by the Emperor in person consisted of 18,000 men, a large number of whom turned against him. In his flight he is said to have wandered through woods, and at length to have reached a place about 6) miles from Cape Haytien with only 1,000 followers, having lost arms, ammunition, and provisions of all kinds, as well as 40,0001. in money. It was doubted whether he would ever regain his power, as intrigues were previously on foot for his deposition. A meeting of the creditors of Messrs.

STATE OP TRADE. MANCHESTE1, FExB. 12. The renewed activity in the Liverpoolcotton-market, consequent to some e.xtent on the advices brought yesterday from the United States by the packet-ship America, hashad a slight reaction upon this market, and there has been more busness in both yarn and cloth than could have been foreseen a fewv days back, when everything was labouring under depression cansed by the unfavourable news from India. Buyers herewere holding back,nunder an impression that has prevailed more or less for some time past, that the price of cotton must come down more thlan it has yet done, in consequence of a more plentiful supply, and manufacturers fresh from their annual stocic-taking, with its disclosures of heavy losses on thetransactions of the pact year, were anxiously cautious to keep their hands as free as possible for a favourable change in the raw I materiaL The advices from the United States, fixing lower estimates than had been hitherto given of the crop of cotton, coupled witi the results of recent observation that the speculative tone of the Liverpool market was encouraged by larger quantities of cotton being taken one way or other by consumers than had been expected, have for the present changed the course which both merchants and manufacturers were disposed to pursue here, and hence a renewal of businessthismorninginmanufactured goods on a larger scale, though not unaccompanied with much uneasiness and doubt as to the policy they are driven to pursue. The advance on cotton is about 1-16&d per lb., and spiners here have been in a position to ask id. pr lb. over the rates of last week, so that manufacturers ave been driven to seek a corresponding advance. In long cloths and T cloths for the Levant there has been a good demand, and business has been done in some cases at a small advance, and in most instances at the extreme rates of last Tuesday. Shirtings madapollam., and jacconots, which were depressed and scarcely saleable last week, have to-day found ready purchasers at rates which were declined last Tuesday, and in some cases at an advance. But for a more considerable advance asked by manufacturers in anticipation of a yet dearer raw material we should probably have had a sll larger busiess. Inyarns, as already stated, an advance of id.. per lb. is asked, and with a feeling that prices may yetbe hher there has been a rather active demand from ome manufacturers and also from the Germans. The des.and for other markets has been pretty general, but on a much less scale. hIessrs. John Slagg and Co. report this evening:- " There is a better feeling in the market, and a more general demand to-day than we have had for the last few weeks. Jacconots, maddapolams, and shirtings, which were so much depressed last week, are now readily saleable at the extreme rates then asked, and in some instances at a slight advance. Long-cloths, T-cloths, and low printers continue in good request, at full prices. lany producers, however, owing to the growig impression that prices oF cotton will at least be maintained, are asking a considerable advance, and the business of the day is in consequence much curtailed.'' Messrs. GeorgeFraser, Son, and Co. say:-"The demand for goods to-day has been steady, with the exception of that perhlaps for India fabrics, wihich are in IeSS inquiry, and inconsequence of the state of the cotton-market many sellers ask a little advance in prices. Yarns are very finm an prices, with a tendency to some advance." Tthe attedance in the cloth-hall this morning was of about an average character, and a fair amount of cloth ch-aged hands. Where any disposition was shown to abate from the bighest range of prices for good woollens, both white and dyed, there wvs not much diffculty in effecting sales. Clothiers did not appearanxious to make reductions, thegeneral opiaion being that wools will soon advance above their present rates A good attendance at the forthcoming sales m the metropolis, which commence on Thursday next, i anticipated. The following is the report of the Huddersfield market of this day:- "There has been a good attendance of buyers, who have been principally on the lookout for job lots cheap. The demand for regular market goods is slightly improved, and sales, on the whole, have be en pretty brisk. The spring pattrs are in fair request. No change in the wool.
RAILWAY INTBLLIGENCE. 4W1VAm IVP-wV'RV The report of the special committee on the affairs of this company, adopted by the board of directors on the 31st uIt., has just been issued. It states that, in consequence of a request which was made by the present chairman of the company, a special committee was appointed by the board of directors on the 3th of August, 185, to inquire into the state and condition of the company, and to devote themselves, in co-operation with him, to a thorough investigation of al its affairs. In the seection of that committee it was thought desirable to request the assistance of the former chairman and the present deputy-chsirman, and also to appoint two other directors who had been nominated to that office by the proprietors in September, 1849, together with one director more recently elected by each of the two Shrewsbury companies, whose connexion therewvith woulad b likely to give material aid in the prosecution of the inquiry. The report compares the capital expendituroof the company on the 30th of June, 1855, with the amount of the outlay estimated bythe committce of consultation in the year 1849, which was fixed by them at about 17,500,0001., provided that certain arrangements could be entered into with the London and NorthWestern Company, for the purpose of saving an ouLtlay of capital to both companies, upon terms of mutual advantage. The consultation committee, with a view to effect a saving, proposed that the Great Western and London and NorthWestern lines at Leamington should ran over one viaduct through that town; that a junction of the respective railways in Binningham should be formed, so as to avoid tho intersection of the centre of that town by two separatc lines, with expensive through stations for each, and by dispensing with the mixed gauge over a portion of the lines north of Oxford. It was further proposed to arrange for a jointlesse or common user of the StourValley line to Wolverhampton. Negotiations were entered ino for that purpose, but all attempts at an arrangement to that ffect failed altogether. The london and North-Western in 1851opposed themeasure inParliament, and it was rejected. Under these circumstances the original design of the years 1845 and 1846 for the Birmingha nd Oxford and Birmingham, Wolverhampton, and Dudley Railways passing through the centre of Birmingham, in direct continuation of each other, and altogether independent of the London and North-Western system, with the central through station on Snow-hill, have been necessarily completed. In addition nlso to such expenditure, a very considerable joint station for the Oxford, Worcester, and Wolverhanipton and Shrewsoury and Birmingham Companies has been required and constructed in the town of Wolverhampton, together with a new junction railway beyond it, to counect the Great Western lInes with the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railwa, near to their Stafford-road station. The committee fEd, after carefully analyzing the details of all the expenditure of capital in respect of those undertkimgs, upon the plans thus unavoidably altered, comprising al that remains still to be paid for their completion, as well as the past expenditure for them, that the cost will exceed the former estimates by 1,950,0001. The consultation committee in 1849 estimated the cost of the Oxford and Rugby, Bir- iniham and Oxford, and Birmingham, Wolverhampton, ana DudDey Railways,with interest to the 1st of Ifay, 1851, at 4,88,0001., but the total expenditure, including all uanfi3haok,ihibliisaditrs,i be 6,638,13Gl., being an increase of 1,9560,136!. Theintcrest alone during theiractuaiconstruction,fromM ay,1851,up to theirrespective periods of opening have added 3G8,000L. to the estimates of the consultation committee. The execess in the purchases of land and compensation upon both of the northern lines through the centre of Birmingham, and through the mineral districts beyond it, have cos 560,0001. more than the estimates of 1849. Excess in cost of works, 385.0001.; mixed gauge and stations, 261,0001. more; 198,0001. for additional stations and goods premises; and 121,0001. extra cost at Wolverhampton joint station. These, with 57,000Z. for legal, Parliamentary, and other general expenses which occurred during the very prolonged period of constraction, make up the excess of 1,950,0001. for the three northerm lines up to their final completion, and including all liabilities. The next Large item of expenditure is that of the Wilts, Somerset, and WVeymoutlh Railway, of which 31V miles aro at present open-viz., from Thinglby Junction fo Frome 19 miles, from Westbury to Warminster 4A miles, and the Radstock branch 8 miles. The portions tiU to be opened are from Frome to Weymouth, 54 miles; fromWarminster to Salisbury, 20& miles; from Bradford to Bathampton, 10 miles; together 93 miles, mking the total length 124. miles. The ascertaincd cost of the whole ndertaLcg, iiicludiag all further expenditure and every liability, will be 3,000,000!. Although only 311 niles of this line have been yet productive of income, the revenue account has been charged ever since 1849 with al the interest on a capitl of 1,370,0001., then expended; and, since the opening of the Radstock branch, in 1854, on a capital of 1,433,0001. ; out of which sum 750,0001., at least, had been actually applied to the land, works, and other expenses for portions of the railway which were for some tine suspended, and are now about to be finished; so that the furthesj interest against the revenue account, when al the 93 additional miles shall have been successively opened, wiU only become payable on the remainder of that capital-viz, on 1,567,000E The special committee state that the board of directors had done their utmost to carry out the recommendations of the consultation committee of 1849, and to complete the Wilts, Somerset, and Weymouth undertaking at the expense of other parties ; but the partaes in question were uable to raise the funds, and proceedings having ensued in the courts of law against the oompany by 7nindamus, and in Parliament by landowners, the company were comnpelled by the act of 1854 to finish and open those lines in the summer of 1S56. Among other items of productive expenditure they state that the 59,500!. expended on the Paddington Hotel yields a return of 2,0001. a-year, and will eventualy realize 3,5001. a-year, or 6 per cent. per annum ; and that the hotel has proved an inducement to the public to select the line for travelling to London, and in that way it becomes indirectly a great benefit to the company. The committee advert to various items in the accounts of the company up to the 30th of June last, but they are more fully given up to the 31st of December last in the statement of the company's accounts which appeaned in The Times of Monday. The committee bear testimony to the just principles upon which the aecounts are made out, and the accurate manner in which they are checked. The stores' accounts are made out strictly on the principle that nothing but that which is really additional new stock, :such as carages, waggons, locomotives, &e., should be charged to capital, whil all renewals and repairs of every description, and however extensive, are charged to revenue. The auditors have regularly checked these accounts every half-year, and they appointed persons whoUy independent of the storekeeper himself to take the stock at different periods. The last occasion for taking stock was in June, 1854, when the difference between the auditors and storekeeper was quite immateriaL With regard to the capital account, the committee state that the borrowed money on various securities would eventually amount to 10,365,000L. These loans represent the first charge on the aggregate revenues of the Great Western lines, alrcady amounting to 1,385,000!. per annum (exclusive always of the two Shrewsbury railways), and producing a net income of 800,000., after paying all the working expenses of the company. Debentures to the amount of 4,365,0001., included above, may be paid off at any time Iy the issue of stock of the company, or in part by the sale o the shares held by the company in other undertakings, so soon as those shares improve in value. The remider (6,000,000!.) may be converted into a mortgage stock or perpetual annuities, not exceeding 4 per cent. per annum. he share capital of the company amounts to 13,174,302!., ineluding 4,825,0001. preference stock, of which 3,417,500L. is at present redeemable, while only 1,407,500., at 4 per cent., is irredeemable. A reduction of interest to 4 per cent, per snysem, whether payable on debentures or on preference stock, after the whole expenditure shall be completed, would alone rePresent a dividend of nearly 1 per cent. per anuum tothe ordinary shareholders. The committee believe that the board have takcen every practicable precaution for obviating the suconvemiences which might attend the renewal of loans, even in the most diflicult times. The committee estimate the total amount that will be required to complete the arrangements of the company for unfinished lines or works, together with the payment of all outstanding and prospective liabilities, will be 1,076,0001., in addition to the expenditure at the end of Decemnber, 1855. Tlhey state that as soon as thait expenditure is completed the capital account of all exYisting engagc ments on Great Western lines may bce considered closed. With regard to the legal and Parlamentary expenses f or Great Western account, including claims in respect of all bills which have not yet b een revised and adjusted, froml1S50 to 1855, both inclusive, the amount is 188,421l., of which 51,0001.was charged to capital before the 30th of June, and 8,.5001. to revenue, leaving an apparent balance against the company of 128,9211. A dvances on account of f d,S s um to the a mount of 79, 0001. have been made, so that the liabilities under that head do not execeed 50,0001., w}~ ' * is comprised in the calculations of expenditure to bA ' raided for. The committee consider Banger's suit at end, and they are not apprehensive as to the result of 1,iIntosb's. The sur plus capital of the company over and above all expenditure and estimated liabilities, as far as it is now possible to foresee, may be stated at 130,000'1. This m,nount is exiclusive of a further suns of 140,0001., which may be amp lied to the general purposes of the two Shrewsbus-y lines. The total authorized capital of these lines amounts to 3,321,033! The com . .ttee then enter at some length into the revenue and ex -iaditure account. E.ith regard to the charge for mainte Ance of permanent way, the plan pursued by the Great .i esterm Company has hitherto been to charge the whole cost of maintenance against revenue, as and when incurred; but that of the other companies compared .th it by the auditors has been to debit the cost of a' aterials used for renewals to a suspense account, charg- .certain annual sums to .revenue for the credit of that account. The consequence has been that, through the system pursued by this company, the whole cost of materZls, as well as of labour, mcurred in the maintenance, has been regularly clarged to and borne by revenue, without any reserve or suspended claim; whereas, by the system pursued by the other companies, the sums charged have often been less than the actual expenditure, and the deficiency has to be provided for at a future period. Ntot only is the cost of maintenance charged against revenue as and when incurred, but the works done are of the most permanent character. During the las five years upwards of 10 miles of clay cuttings have been permanently drained and ballasted, several of the embanlenents have been considerably raised and rebalasted, and, besides the ordinary repairs of statios, permanent improvemens and per ent addtions have boen made at Bristol, Bath, Shrivenham, and other parts of the lie. 'The committee satiisfied that the stock of engines, wggons, vans, and carriases snot only large, but- in good order, and that a sum f 250,000. will beaample torrovide additional plan XW work the )Vilts, &mer*et, a a Weymouth line when open throughout, and that smm is included in the estimated labilities. From the 3Dth of June, 1853, to the 30th of Junc, 1855, there had been an increase of 75 in the number of clerks employed, of 13 in the guards, 37 policemen, and 158 porters. Of this increase 31 clerls, 7 guards, 16 police. men, and 44 porters were required at Paddington. The additionalchargeuponrevenuesicel853 onthataccomuntainounts to 21,0001., owhich the increase at Paddingtonisabout 9,00W. The main cause of the increase in the expense is owing to the extension of lines and increase in the number of stations. Since the 30th of June, 1853, 52? miles of railway worked by the company and 28 staions have been opened for traffic-namely, 5 miles from Grange-court to ksopebrook, 11th of July, 1853 - 9 miles to Wycombe, 1st of August, 1854; L22 miles, Birunghain, Wolverhampton, and Dudley, 14th ofNiovember, 18541 8 miles to Radstock, same day: and 17t miles, 1st of June, 1855, Hereford, Ross, and Glocester Railway. These additions made to the establishment could not have been dispensed with. After adverting to the means adopted by the company to secure efficient clerks and servants, an a recommendation that Mr. Brunel's allowance of 3,500!. for engineering servicesbe continued for another year, they state they havemnuch. pleasureinrecording their opinion of the able, efficient, and zealous manner in which the company has been served by its officers, and, regarding them as a body, that it is impossible to speak too highly of them. The committee advert to the satisfactory increase in the traffic duringthe past three yeas, and think it but easonable to expect that the time as come when the goods and miineral traffic ri he reatl increased, andbg salutary arrangements the wholo of Ywit i be developed with advantage to tho propritor The goods trafficisatpresent managed byMr. Newcombe inthenorth, Mr. Forbes in the west, and Mr. Drewo in the south. The comnitteewpropose that in future Mr. Newcombe should be the headSotIthegoods decartinent, and that a thoroughly competent person under him be placed in the north. With regard tothe development of the coal trade, the committee make various suggestions, and show from the increase of %raffic on the Shrewsbury lines that loss on the guarantee to those conpanies wil soon be reduced to a very small amount. Since 1850the increased receipts on the line between London and Bristol amount to 200,000. a-year, some portion of which is attributed to the new lines. In concsusion, the report, which is signedby the chairman of the company, states that:- "- In the next half-year most of the remaining liabilities will fall upon the current revenue, because by that time the Wilts, Somerset, and Weymouth line, as well as the lUxbridge and Henley branches, will be opened. The extent of new revenue to be derived from these sources will depend upon the condition of the country, the activity of trade, and the influenceswhich a state of peace or war may bring to bear upon the amonut of traffic,; but, looking to the fact that the whole outlay of the undertaking will then be coinplete; that the expenses incident to a portion of these lines is nOow borne by revenue, wvith scarcely any return for it; that a considetable traffic may le reasonably expected from the opening up of a new line of country which has not yet the benefit of railway accommodation; that the general receiptsofthewholeGreat Western systemare improving not merely byfits and starts,but stedly and continuously, and that the proposed arrangements with reference to coal traffic will alone yield anadditional income of from 60,0001. to 80,0001. a year, itis fairto conclude that there is much reason for confidence and hope, and that the proprietors will ultimately find, when the causes of the present depression have been removed, that they possess an investment which is permanently v.aluable candintrinsically secure." The directors of this com p any have just issued their report, which is to be submitted to the half-yearlyineeting on Friday next. It states that the traffic of the past half-year, as compared with the same period in 1854, has increased upon the Great Western railways to the extent of 80,0921., and upon the two Shrewsbury railways in the amount of 23,7771. The eyense of earning those additional receipts amounted to 31,6921. on Great Westem account, and 8,617! on Shrewsbury account, shovwing an increase in the net earnings of 54,400! on the Great Western, and of 15,160!. on the Shrewsbury lines-together, 69,560!. The results of this improving traffic uponI all portions of their raUways, at a moderate cost, had enabled the directors to propose a dividend at the rate of 2A per cent. per aunum, leaving a balance of 16,1601., but,-if a charge of 7,700!. against the receipts had not been mnade in respect of the mail service, anav which had nothing to do with the past half-year, there would have been more than sufficient for a 3 pmer cent, dividend. In addition to this a considerable claim still exLsts against tlhe Postmaster-General for very expensve night services between tho 1st of Febraarv- and the st of December, 1855, the remuneration for which has not yet been ascertained. The report adverts to general increase of traffic over the company's lines, the prospect of increased business from the conveyance of coaLs, and the early completion of all the company's lines now in course of constrection. The statement oa accounts appeared in Tlhe Timas of Monday. Major Court has given notice of his intention to move a formal resolution at the half-yearly meeting of this company on Friday next, in reference to the bylawvs of the company, with a view to provide for the more perfect administration of the affairs of the comnpTany, and to protect the property of the shareholders; and for that purpose he intends to propose the formation of a committee, consisting of 13 shareholders, each holding not less than a certain amount of consolidated stock of the company. The members of the proposed committee are to be elected at an adjourned meeting of the company not later than the Ist of May next, and their duties will be to recommend such bylaws for adoption by the company as the cominjttee may deem necessary. He also proposes that the directora should supply an alphabetical list of the shareholders in the cotmpany who hold an amount of stock sufficient to qualify hem to become members of the committee of bylaws, and that such list be printed and circulated among the shareholders before the 21st of March next, in order that they may have the means of selecting such members as they may approve to constitute the committee. MONKLAND. The directors of this company intend to declare a dividend at the rate of 6A per cent. per annum for the halfyear ending the 31st ofDecember last on the consolidated stock of the company, leaving a balance (,f 2,9001. SEREWSBURY AND HREFORD. The half-yearly meeting of this company was held at Shrewssbury on Monday. Mx. Ormsby Gore, the chairman of the company, presided. The CfniURamA said there were at present 7,830 shares in the hands of the company, but rather than dispose of these at the present discount the directors thought it better to borrow money on temrprary loans for present pm poses. The report stated that a bill for raLsing additional capital would be brought before Parliament. The rent had beenpaid by Mr. Brassey for the half-year ending 31st of December last, and the directors recommend a dividend at the rate of 4 per cent, per annum, less incometax. The gross receipts from traffic show an increase of 61, per cent. over those of the corresponding period of 1854: The directors expect a further improvement in the traffic. The capital account showed that 549,592!. had been received, and 539,1171. expended, leaving a balance of 10,274f. On the motion of the CnAir.',ffaw the report was adopted. The CsAsRsAN regretted to say that hitherto Mr. Brassey (the contractor of the line) had been a loser, but he hoped for better things in future. RAILWAY PROPREITORS' ASSOCIATION. A deputation from this recently-formed association 1-M. lengthened interview yesterday with the Chancellor ,. Exchequer for the purpose of asldng him to reduce th;5ty upon railway proxies. Mr. W. Mumnss, the chairman of the ass-- :on, urged upon the righthon. gentleman the evils whi ' .ulted from the present high duty of 2s. 6d. upon eve., railway proxy that was issued. The consequenee was, he said, that paid railway chairmen, or others-who had-- directobjee to serve, sent out proxies at their own expense, and carried their views in opposition to the wi" of a vast number of the shareholders, who, not havi- buch direct interests at stake, could not go to the expense of sending out many hundreds of proxies. In some casp, directors even sent proxies to their own friends only, -sd charged the CWA of the stamps to the company. TheCANxcELLr 'the ExerEQusR expressed himself surprised at sune .ceeding, and said that it was anything but a f' r of eliciting the opinions of the shareholders. D' -isociationsuppose, however, thatrailway proprietors lethargic thatwhen their interests were mvolveeothey w. d not goto the expense of 2s. 6d. for a stamp ai their own accord ? X- I&uass said that experience had proved that they weo i not. Proxy stamps, accomnpared by ez pae.C cirncula were profusely scattered blv the directors, and the cons uence was that country shareholders, having only one -e of the qur -tion before them, were constantly mdsed, and voted in ignorance of the real facts of the case. Mr. GA;SxxLL said that the association pressed the question rather on moral grounds than as a matter of revenue. If the Government would yield this duty, he should have no objection, as a railway shareholder, to be taxed in another form. M1r. McEH L said he calculated that, if the stamp was reduced to Id., at least 16 proxies would be used where one was used at present. This would yield Is. 4d. for stamps, ls. 4d. for pastage in sending the proxies to the individuals, and ls. 4d. returning them, or 4s. in place of 2s. 8d., as at present. The CsrAcNcELLo of the ExcnxquEn attributed much of the present depreciation of railway property to the course of legislation which had permaitted competition; but stillI he could readily conceive tnat so large a stamp as Zs. 6dL did interfere somewha twith the freecexpression of voting. He asked what they thought would be the effect of reducing the stamp to 1Is. The deputation were unsnirus in urging that, unless it were reduced to 6d. at the highest, no very tangible result wouldbe obtained. With asixpenny stamp, however, they believed that a great moral influence might be brought to bearby independent shareholders upon directors. After some remarks from Mr. HoDnsois, Mr. Fox, and others, Sir C. LEwis stated that he quite understood the object -which the deputation hadin view, and that he would give the subject his best consideration. RAILWAY BELLS IN PARLIAMENT.

.S,VE MiE FROir MrY BRiE-xDSi (From the Bosto. Daily Tinzc.) Mr. Bright, the English " peace-at-any-price" man, recently made a vcry long speech before an English mechanics' institute, in which he spoke vcry highly of theUnited Statec, though we think Armericans would be none the less pleased f he had not spoken so depreciatingly of his own country. it'seems as if his object had been not so much to praise us as to make England appear little in the comparison. He talks as if he thou.-ht we were the most peaceably-disposed people on earth, v-hereas there is as strong a fihting element among us as ever there was in France. He alUrdes to our navy, and says that wve have but two or three frigates. From this it should seem that he never had heard that the last Congress voted several milions of doUlars to build six of the most powerful steam frigates in the world, which are now on the eve of completion. It is proposed that the present Congress shaU add as many more steamships to the navy, and make other additions to it. lAr Bright may rest assured that few Ahmericans look upon the comparative small-ness of their country's navy as something to be proud of and to rejoice over. It is seen wvith regret, and Government ca. do no more popular act than to add to the navy's strength and efficiency. Not a few of our countrymen are of opinon that the navy ought to be so constituted as to be able to command aIl the Anerican seas, and there is reason in their view of what should be our policy. Grant that we should be able to defeat any army that might be landed here, woould it not be a viser thing to prevent an army from landing? This could best be done by our being so strong at sea as to mak-e it a matter of -very grave doubt whether any force could assail us ith success. The best negotiators, after all, are heavy fleets, for a maritime nation. The very fact that you are powerful on the ocean may be the reason why the eatent of your power shall never be tested. Mir. Bright's ideas on navral matters would meet with no response in this country out of the class of the Burrittites, or some other eqully harmless class of madmen. The Government here has never kept pace vith public opinion on the subject of the navy, ad it done five times as much for it, te demimands of that opinion would hardly have been complied with-certainly not exceeded. Mr. Bright alludes to our small army, and does so in terns complimentary to us. It is true that our army is small, but then our population is warlke in its character, and four-fifths of the men of miltary age are more or less familiar with the use of anus. In some of the States thousands of young men have a very respectable Inmowledge of the details of a military life. From these men vould the better portion of our armies, in the event of waar, be recruited. They would afford sflendid material for soldiers. Yet even those who think Eighest of the valour and military sp,irit of the mass of the people are of opinion that the smallness of our army is a grave evil, and that we could not do a better or a cheaper thin- than to treble its numbers. Had we had 5,000 or $,000 additional regular troops in 1846 the Mexican war -would have been brought to a close that year, or have been far advanced. Al the valour in the world ean't make young and inexperienced troops as effective as old ones. 'Tley suffer so much in health that that alone is a serious imnpediment to military operations. The Indian wars in which we have been engaged have been promoted by the smallness of our regular force. We have never been able to keep the aborigines down, or to fight them from the first with effect when once they have risen. Our trained forces have been frittered away in the early part of such contests, and then have come militia, who have done half the wor at twice the cost of regular soldiers. The milions mponnmilionsthat were sunk in the Florida war would mostly have been saved, and the war itself have been ended in half.as many mouths as it lasted years, if we had had experienced troops in numbers sufficient to have crushed the .Idians when they first showed symptoms of a determina- tion to rise. The Indian wars that -e are now carrying on, L-ndin wvhich we arelosingnot afewmen, wouldneverhave occurred, or would have been quielvy concluded, if our standin" army bore any proportion either to our means, to thewor, required of it, or to the position of the nation. Xhe victories won in the Mlexican war were, in several instances, due to the excellence of our artilery, and that is an arm of the service that is not to be improvized. It can be brought to the point of great Narlike effiienCY only by long and diligent training. Buena Vista would hUve been a lost day, and Taylor never would have been 1resident, but for.tbe admiirable practice of the American atillery.

THE UNYI TD STATES. fvr.omr o OWN COUcov.SREOsmNENT.) WASIIIZGTON, J,. 27. Thbe snowv Avliich is fallkig and drifting as I write thte-ttens to RA1ck up the railways between here and Boston, adn make the passage of a letter to the steamer wuruertain #fter to-day. I therefore write a day in netance eE the usual mail, trusting to the te1egru'h to Iaiag the news to the latest date. ThC fortiiLt that has passed away hias Drongnus about no orginization of the House. The Administration supreorters have abandoned their old canT.1 date, in fiavour of aSoith Carolinian, without sCfurinG any additional support from the native mericans. The RepubLlans stick by their c>didate, steadllr voting him within five or six of -najority. Severt efforts have been made to Wing about an organization by throwing questions of publc interest into the House for discussion. Among these ire the President's Message upon t?io Kansas ques4ies .and resolutionis and outside talk about the rela4ions -with Great Britain. The Xessage was read std laid aside withiout discssion, and the resolniions voted dovn by lar-e m'jor Biies. Te House is not dlisposed to meddie with any of these matters until it settles the question of its own organization; and then, with the temper that prevails, I judge that it will be more disposed to discuss Kansas and slavery than Cential America and the Neutrality Laws. Yesterday a decided move was taken towards organization. At tle opening the Republicans hada majority, if they could have united. Yesterday the Hosee passed a series of resolutions, one of which affirmed the inexpediency of agitating the slavery questionx either in or out of Congress. It now seems to be thouight possible to choose a Speaker to-morrow. The Senate, meanwhile, are joging on quietly, holding two sessions a-wcek. The promised debate on Central America has not yet taken place, having been adjourned from last Thursday for the convenience of General Cass, who has the floor. It is understood that he will speak to-morrowv. Senator Clayton made the production of Lord John Russcll's despatch of January, 1853, on Thursday the occasion of a strong expression of his own views upon this question. Hc was the Minister who negotiated the treaty with Sir Henry Builwer, and he says that it was intended to be retrospective as well as prospective. He also claimed that Lord John Russell's construction of the treaty was the same as his own. When he sat down the discussion wvas adjourned until to-morrow, and the Senate proceeded to other matters. In the coiirse of the morning the Kansas Mlessage came in and was read. As soon as the reading was finished Senator Seward, of New York, the head of the Republican Opposition, rose and said that the foreign relations of this country were in a delicate situation; that an important discussion was to be resumed in the Senate on the followving Mlonday on which the coLntry ought to present an undivided front; and that, strongly as he objected to the principles of the Message, he was disposed for the present to waive all discussion and let it go at once to the committee. Ho was followed by other members in the same strain, and a colloquial debate ensued as to the proper committee of reference. In this Unreported discussion I observed that several Administration senators, while talking bravely, manifested a wvillingness to postpone this discussion. MIr. Mlason, of Vnirginia, chairman of the conmnittee on foreign relations, in particular, was decided in his opinion that it was impolitic to discuss the question before the organization of the House. These straws arc slight, but serve to confirn may opinion, frequently expressed, that the Administration do not wish to press matters to a rupture. I shall not be surprised if the debate shows a wiLlingness in the Senate to listen to a proposition for arbitration, if a satisfietory scheme can - be de-iscd. At the same time I think it will shbw a disposition not to make sulch a propsiton from this side. The Mashington Union publishes the followin official paragraDh - "It ought not to be expected that we should give a for. mal contradiction to the various rmnours which are originated here and transmitted by telegraph, either with the view of affecting the administration or of promoting the pecuniary interests of the papers to which they are sent. Occasionally, however, these ramours assume a character or are repeated with a degree of persistency which renders a contradictitin necessary. Of this kind aro the 1ate reports as to the withdrawal of Mr. Buchanan from England and as to the intention of the President to send to the Senate a special message in regard to pending difficulties with that Governmnent. For example, a correspondent of the Journal of Commerce says on the 15th inst. that 'the President will, as he stated yesterday, senda special message to the Senate in its executive character next Monday, or some day soon, in relation to our controversy with Great Britain.' And aigain, the same correspondent, on the next day, said:-' The President has assured several senators that he will, after some further consultation With the Cabinet, send to that body a message, informing them concerning the condition of our difficulties wvith England, .and submitting the same for their advice and consideration.' The effect, if not the design, of all rumours of this kind is to excite apprehensions as to a rupture between our Government and that of Great Britain. To avoid any such consequences it is only necessary for us to say that the whole batch of reports of the character alluded to are entirely w;ithout foundation, and deserve no sort of attention from the readers of the journals to which tney are sent. They not only do grossinjustice to the President, but theyare calculated to affect the interest of commercial men, who are kept in a state of suspense bythe repetition of these mischievous inventions." The Administration is now awaiting the reply of the British Cabinet to its demands concerning MIr. Crampton. This is expected to arrive in about a fortnight, when we shall know whether this question is to drag itself further along. MIr. IBuchanan has intimated his purpose of leaving London on or about the 20th- of February, from which it is supposed here that the matter w ill be brought to a crisis. The negotiations on this questionhaving been entirely conducted at Iondon,we are igtnorantliere of their presentposition. The selection of a successor to Mr Buchanan has not yet been made, or, at least, not made public. Slhouild Mr. Crampton receive his passports from this Govermnent for acts which his own Government avow and assume the responsibility of, and should the British representation consequentlybe suspended here, wonld it not be difficult for the American Government to continue a representative in London? The Kansas MIessage will probably excite an animated debate when taken up. The President, after reviewving the facts, takes ground 'with the lissouri pro-slavery Government and ag,ainst the Free State c onstitution, which he calls revolutionary and treasonabe. He announces his purpose of enforcing his views with the federal troops, if necessary, and recom-ends the passage of a law to organize a new convention under the direction of Cono_ress to frame a constitution for the admission of 1nsas as a State. He also asks theappropriation of money to enable him to enforce the law. From what I have hitherto written of the temper of the Northern States on this question you may judge that these propositions will not be passed quietly over. The House passed a resolution yesterday against the policy of the Kansas Nebraska Act, and in favour of the restoration of the lissouri Compromise. There is a plan before the Legislature of MIaryland for transferring the management of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal from the State to persons for the benefit of the bondholders; and another project for disposingof the States' interest in the canal ($8,000,000, with some 20 years' interest) for the same purpose. The amual statement of the Illinois Central Pailroad shows total receipts of over $1,500,000, of which $693,000 were from passengers and $630,000 from freight. 1 am told that the transportation charges were about 60 per cent. of this gross amount. The total sales of lands are returned at528,863 acres for -5,007,190, for which t;he comnpany hold notes for $3,894,285 on account of construction bonds, and for $959,509 on account of free land bonlds.

By the Royal Aail Company's stearoshipAvon, Captain Revett, %ith no BrazUian and River Plate mails, in charge of Iseuteiw,nt Charlton, R.N., Admiralty agent, we have dates fr"An Buenos Ayres, January 2; Montevideo, 5; -Rio Janeiy ,, 15; Bahia, 19; Pernambuco, 22; St.Vincent's, 30; Te;weriffe, February 3; Madeira, 5; Lisbon, 8. * TheAvon brings 82 passengers and the crew of the condemned vessds Constitntion and Dido from Madeira. On freight there is specie from Buenos Ayres, 4,936!.; Pernambuco, MI91.; from Rio Janeiro, 472 ez. of gold, say, value, 1,400!. ; total, 7,0251.; diamonds, valued at 22,258!.; and P cargo consisting of 723 serons of cochineal, 33 boxes of. orangeS, 71 bales of tapioca, 48 serons of ipecacaanhut, 10 bales of tobacco, 10 cases of wine, and 130 packages of samples, &c. Fiom Buenos Ayres our dates are to the 2d ult. It .as generally believed that the negotiations at the Paranawould end in nothing. Everything was dull and gloomy. Tho British Paeclt of December 29 publishes the following:- " The new invasion of Flores must be held the event of the week. He disembarked at Las Piedras with some three or four companions, and on the 24th we find him about the sources of the Arroyo del 1edio, some 10 leagues inland, at the head of a party numbering upwards of 100, inclnding Bustos, LImela, Clavero, Luzurriaga, &c. "On thisoccasion, judging from their published correspondence, the Santafecino authorities on the frontier appear to have acted with spirit and in good faith, which we hail as a welcomo symptom of returning confraternity. Colonels Orono and Cardoso, advised of the .asemblage, imunediatelystarted in pursuit; and to their effective co-operation the easy discomfiture of the enterpriso must be mainlyascribed. "On the 24th a convoy of arms and ammunition, evidently intended for the invaders, was intercepted by Commandant Cardoso, and the escort, consisting of an officer and eight mein, made prisoners. This probably disconcerted the pln in a vital poit * stil, on the following morning, Christmasday, theycrossod the Rubicon-that is, the Arroyodel Medio, the boundary line betweern this State and Santa Fc, thereby consummating the invasion. " Having arrived at the Canada del trbolito, apparently vithout Pursuit or molestation, they there halted; and on the afternoon of the same day the p-arty, from some cause or other, broko up and dispersed. Of the dispersed part must have recrossed the Arroyo del Medio, for we hear of 20 being captured by the autlorities of Santa Fe. Meanwhile, Fiores, with his staff and some 60 followers, shaped a co-rse southwvard, apparently in the direction of Pergamino. These are the essential facts, extracted from the series of communications that form the official bulletin published by the Cronica; in which, to be candid, rwe finid some things wve do neOt coemprehend, and consequently cannot explain. "aer; ltingfrher is known of the movements of the invaders; but by thle latest accounts they wer still in the territory of the State; and, so far from being routed, had not even been attacked." In the southern frontier Colonels Gonzalez and OcaTmpo, with a force of 1,000 men, had assumed the offensive, and penetrated into the desert to attack the Indians. Of thle movements of General lornos very little was said or known. The monthly retrospect of affairs in Buenos Ayres for Deconiber, 1&-5, shlow-s a dedded languor in the local demand for manufactured goods. Little progress had been made in securing thle frontiers against the Indians, although frequent invasions which had taken place showed the actual dangers which were to be apprehended. iThe Britis,t Packd, after illustrating many of the commercial and other difficulties under which the Buenos Ayreans are labouring, says,- " In short, the evils are become complicated and chronic, and it is not in one or two months that we must expect to cease from them. The demand for the interior provinces and the Republic of Paraguay has also fallen off during the past month. The rurnoured collisions and the warlike preparations being made may have had a share in bringing about this sorry resullt. In military equipments they were exhausting, perhaps forestalling, the resources that should lave been devoted to immigration, internanl improvements, and the development of the productive industries that could alone sustain a healthy and profitable foreign commerce." In articles of daily consumption abundant supplieshad been received during the month, and in many articles the stocks in hand were very heavy. Combinations of dealers had monopolized the wholesale market by buying up entire cargoes on joint account, which were resold to the retail dealers at their own price. Thse operations for a time maintained an artificially high figure, but, the market becoming glutted, wholesale prices declined, and even at considerably reduced rates it was very difficult to effect sales. -In, export produce, large contracts for hides had taken place, but, nevertheless, it was expected that, in consequence of so many vessels being in port, a Large namber would be compelled to leave in balastSince the new,s by the Panapero, which arrived on the 23d of December, wool had sho*n a slight downward tendency; bat the bulk of the clip had previously been contracted for. Shearing operations were considerably delayed from the unsettled state of the weather. The wool, however, came in rapidly, and all parties agreed that it was by far the best conditioned clip ever remitted from that quarter. The cause assigued is that sheep had acquired an intrinsic value, and were attended to accordingly. The oscilations in the money-market had been generally great. Ounmcesclosed on the 31st of December at 3341. The Last published quotations in exchange for bills on London are 70, highest; OS to 66 lowest. The following British merchant vessels were at Buenos Ayres at the latest advices:-Golden Eagle, Gaucho, Eliza Jenkins, Abbot, Bosphorus, Jane Anna, livonia, Blossom, Neptune, Claudia, Marion Macintire, 7 de Marzo, Jane Lakey, Anne and John, Manuelita, Daring, Usk Ipswich, Britannia, Cynthia, Cornucopia, Isis, Acorn, L O., Elizabeth Wood, Ferris, Heath, Gauntlet, Arethusa, Earl of. Carlisle, William James, Sir HI Parnell, Virago, Crusader, and Partisan. A barbarous murder is stated to have taken place at Buenos Ayres on the morning of the 1st of January, but no particulars are given. From Monte,ideo our advices state that disunion, anarchy, and prostration appear to have reached a climax. Senor Vergeshad arrived on hiswaytoRio Janeiroasminister Plenipotentiary of Paraguay; and a similar mission had been confided to General Guido, near the Government of Paraguay, as a representative of the Confederate Provinces. Intelligence from Rio is to the 14th ult. The cholera had disappeared from that capital, but had broken out in other portions of the Brazilian empire. A statement has been published which shows the amount of business transacted during the year 1855, and, although the mischief produced throughout the country by the cholera and the political position of Europe are considerable of increase trade is perceivable. In imports more activity prevailed during the first six months than in the three preceding seasons, though with little improvement in prices, eox cepting flour, provisions generally, and a few other articles, sonie of which reahzed high rates, subsequently causing heavy arrivals to takeplace and a material decline in value. Woven manufactures participated in the improvement in the early part of the year, but this important branch of the import trade, notwithstanding the absence of excessive receipts as in previous years, became dull during the last four or five months owing to the cholera, which tended to paralyze the demand and intercourse with the interior of the country, whence remittances had fallen off so materially as to be seriously felt by the shopkeepers and importers. The epidemic in the city and province, fortu nately, being comparatively mild and subsiding, gives hope for a better business in the present year, which commences with a lighter stock of goods than of- late years. The progressing means of conveyance by rail and otherwise will, in time, prove great auxiliaries to the general improvement of the country and its commerce, though one serious drawback still exists-the want of suffiient immigration-which the present Government is using every cffort to encourage, and which is now the more imperative since forced labour is dininishing, partly by the cholera among the slave population, partly on account of the very stringent and severe measures adopted by the public authorities for the entire suppression of the slave trade. Early in the past year the money-market was easy; however, towards the close of March and during the m6nth of April the Nsational Bank materially restricted their discounts, raising at the same time the rate of interest to S per cent.; and, although later money was more easily obtained, yet this rate remained unaltered to the close of the year. Ouxt of the bank the ruling rate for firstclass- paper had been from 8] to 9 per cent. The total amount of bills of exchange is estimated during tle past year at 6,185,0001. on London, 14,580,000f. on France, and8,140,O00marksbanco on Hamburg. Theextreme rates have been 27d. to 28id. on London (very little above 28d.), 340rs. to 360rs. on France, and 640r to 662rs. on Ham. |burg. The expectations of a better rate of exchange, based on the very heavy exports of coffee in the past year, have not been realized, which in some measuro is to be attributed to the large remittances by the Government and by the National Bank for returns in bullion, as also to other unusual demands for remittances to Europe. The total importg during the year 1855 amounted to about 2,000,000l., and exxots to about 490,000l. Thecoffee exported is estimated at 2,392.007 bags against 1,994,575 in 154. The iinportations of sugar were 1,393,429 arrobas. The rum imported was 15,60 pipes; exported,.; 1,o60 lpes,- !The iommercial amvals were 1,196 vessels of 348,678 tons regis against 991 in 1854.

Exchange for bills on London was firm at 27id. The market opened at 28d., and the total amount negotiated was 380,000!.; France, 342 to 34S, negotiated 1,000,000f.; Hamburg, 645 to 650, negotiated 1,080,000 marks bando. The following of Her tajesty's ships were at Rio :-Madagascar, Rifleman, Sharpshooter, and Indefatigable. French -Poursuivante and Giraffe. American-Savannah and Germanstown. There were a large number of merchant ships in port. Dates from Bahia furnish inteuligence to the 19th ult. The Christmas holydays wvere hardly over, and businss had scarcely been resumed. The market was superabundantly supplied wvith drygoods, flour, and fish.. The stock of flour amounted to 19,000 barrels, the latest sales of New Orleans realizing $18, and Richniond $27. The stock of fish, which reached 11,700 barrels, was realizing $15. Sugar from the interior arrived freely, but from the outports only a few hundred cases had come in. The crop it was expected would be one-third below the average. The stock in hand when the Avon left was 6,564 cases, 292 boxes, 671 barrels, and 26,000 bags. Superior, for Sweden, was fetching 25s. 2d. to 30s. ad. per cwt. free on board ex freight and commission; good browns, for Channel, 23s. 6d. per cwt. free on board ex freight and commission; ordinaTy brovms, 22s. 5a., free on board cx freight and commission. A reduction was expected in the more ordinary qualities. Coffee was in good demand, 40s. 3d. being the current rate, free on board ex freight and commission. Cocoa was eagerly purchased at 38s. 7d. per ewt. free on board, cx freight, anu commission. The following is a return of the crop exported for the years ending September 30th, 1854 and 185:1-54--Sugar, 35,1S9 cases, 890 boxes, 148,095 bags; coffee. 23,653 bags. 1S55-Sngar, 44,845 casas, 1,018 boxes, 226,367 b gs; coffee, 56,476 bas. The intelligence from Fernambuco to the 21st ult. is thus summed up :-The past month, although interrupted by holydays, has been an important one, and imports and sales have been heavy. The business in dry goods has been but limited, and few sales have taken place. In codfish arrivals and sales have been considerable ; in the absence of arrivals of jerked beef (of which there was received almost nothing) as high as 16,000 reis per drum was obtained by retaiL No material change in the flour markets, and stocks were heavy and moved off slowly. In sugarsentries were heavy, and quite equalled by shipments, the tendency of the market being somewhat on the rise. Iimnediately after the arrival of the last steamer heavy purchases were made at 2,100 to 2,150 rcis, while on the 21st 2,300 reis per arroba was paid for Channel browns. This was owing to the decline in freights. Shipping was heavy, and but little doing in the way of charters excepting for ballast to LiverpooL Several vessels were being partly loaded for that port at 20/. per. ton. Exchanges fluctuated from 234d. to 29d., and a large amount was transacted. - Cotton was bought up at 5,200 to 5,400 reis, but the entries were trifling.
.PORTUGAL. SOUTHIULPTON, FEB. 12. By the Royal mail steamship Avon, vvhich arrived this morning, we have datesfromLiisbon to the 5th inst. The Minho steamer left for Liverpool on the 7th, and the Peninsular packet Madrid was to leave, as usual, on the Oth with the uails for Southampton, calling at Oporto and Vigo. The Milan steamer, from Marseilles for Liverpool, put into Lisbon for coals a few hours before the Avon left. Her Majesty's ship St. George was the only foreign vessel of war in port. Tho A-von does not bruig any political newvs of importance from Lisbon. The debate upon the reply to the Throne had commenced in the Deputies, where the Minister of Finance had presented the budget for 1S56-57, shoNving 10939 contos of revenue, and 12-584 contos of e-xpenditure; but by adding to the tevenue the usual abatements from the Royal allowances aud from public salaries the calculated deficit is reduced from 1,655 contos to 355 contos, or about 80,000. The Minister of Finance had also brought forward his arranigement with the foreign bondholders, and a bill to regulate the trade in grain, allowing free exportation and importations upon a sliding scale of duties.
31AlIE SUGoAs.-The maple sunar crop of the year 1355 is estimated by the officials int`Vashington in the agricultural bureaut at $2,720,000. Maple sugar, being a product of the forest, is chiefly confined to those regions of the interior where it is a cheap and ready substitute for the more costly and less accessible product of the cane. The large production of the present year may be regarded as an effort of the rural populatioa to remedy a deficiency in the supply of this necessary article. How far the maple can be looked to as a permanent resource we caa only conjecture, but the subject is worthy of consideration. Cane grows only in the extreme southern latitudes of the United States. The sugar maple, however, flourishes in the greater part of the inhabited sections, and, though the article produced by it is inferior to the other, yet, as it requires but little care, it is much cheaper. Now,the question is whether it is capable of regular cultivation for this purpose. Were the proper attention bestowed it is possible that it might, since there is no reason why a forest of sugar maples might not be reared as well as a forest of sugar cane. A mueh better expedient, however, would be the cultivation of the sugar beet, which is so successfully practised in France. About two year. since it was announced that the Mormons in Utah had gone extensively into the reari?g of this crop, and had erected sugar-mills and refineries, m order to supply themselves with sugar. The introduction of this culture into the United States might afford a profitable occupation for many of our farmers, since the price of sugaris SUch asto insure a very handsome return to the producer. With such immense territorial possessions we have it in our power to become in a great measure a self-sustaining nation, rearing nearly all the crops required for our own nse.-rhil1ed4,afc KVO3I Amernican. TvIPmu TRusTs.-The general report made by order of the Secretary of State was published on Saturday. It shows that the financial condition of the turnpike trosts generally continues to imp rove under the regulations and arrangements made by Parliament during the last few years, notwithstanding the gradual decrease of the revenue from tolls. Thus, the total receipts in 1853 were 1,135,2811., against 1,142,5921. in 1852 and 1,138,7541. in 1851, while the enpenditure was 1,161,7S71. in 1853 against 1126,3841. in 1852 and 1,115,4241. in 1850. The amount of bonded debt in 1853 was 5,663,271L., and the unpaid interest 942,5251. Comparing the several items of 1853 with those of 1852 it is observable that the toll income in 1853 was further re- luced by 6,0441., but, looking at the total amount of the toll revenue (1,068,782.), tns reduction is onlyequal to Ujs. 3d. per cent., and cannot be deemed unsatisfactory. The reduction, moreover, is Partly accounted for. The amount of cash borrowed in 185& was 16,010Z., being nearly equal to that borrowed in 1852. The total sums expended in repairing the roads in 1853 was 611,1201., being an increase of 36,4641. as compared with the preceding year. Of the toll income alone 586,6331. was expanded on re I pairs, 108,3811. on salaries and law charges, and 357,036r. on payment of the debt and interest. Between 1837 and 1853 the toll incomne has fallen from 1,509,9851. to 1,06%,7821., or to the amount of 441,2031., bnt within the same period the annual expenditure for repairs has been reduced by 327,3551., the ependiture on law chares, to., 17,43!., andt the expense of the debt and interest by 55,95 1* 41,953b vas expended for "improvements " in 1853.. The debt hasbeen gradually reduced upwards of 1,000,000!., and the average rate of interest payable on the existing debts has' also been reduced., as wellas the bonded or mortgage debt.' The total expenditure in 1853 exceeded the income by 26,506t.-an unusual circumstance, arising from the payacent of larger sums forzrepairs and improvements. The e-- sult was a reduction of the balance in handfrom 336,4041. to 209,898!.

At the top of the town a Lamge range of dwellinghouses and the theatre have heea pulled down to create lnore room for military acormmodaLion, while at the bottom a heavy battery of 16 68-pounder pivot guns is in courS of completion, having taken the place 6f the old platform of 6-pounder saluting guns. In the rear of these has been erected a large shelU magazin, flanked by a high earti nound to protect it from the shot of an enemy seaward; newembrasures for heavy3? pounders have been cut in the curtain of the ramparts at various points commanding Southsea, where a mad fort has been built near the 6od stone fortress, Southsea Castle, to strengthen that defence. A new double drawbridge is in course of erection in lieu of the old single one at St. Jamesgate "Point," where abatteryandRoyalAxrtneryquarters in rear have for some time been built to protect tho mouth of the harbour on the right of the entrance. The Government are also endeavouring to negotiate for a large extent of house property in Green-row and the rear for further enlarging the barrack accoenmodation, and this to the extent (says military rumour) of 30,0DD mnenX If so, Portsmoath and its adjacent dependencies must become almost exclusively a citadeL The new steam gun and despatch boat Lapwing, 4, was put in commission on Monday by Commander Thomas Saumarez, and the new class 0-gun screw despatch boat Pioneer was put in commission yesterday by Commander Mends. Her Majesty's ship Blenheim, 60, Captain W. H. Hall, was undocked at Portsmonth yesterday after refit. R. H. Pearson, assistant engineer, Ist class, R.N., has been appointed to Her Majesty's despatch gun vessel Sparrowhawk, in charge of the engines. Her Majesty's screw steamship Algiers, Captain Talbot, from the Mlediterranean, was off Plymouth yesterday after. noon, and, in consequence of orders from the Port Admiral SirWillians Parker, proceeded up C1hanne, steaming slowly. The screw steam transport Black Diamond, No. 2, was off Plymouth on Monday at noon, from the Crimea, for the eastward. The paddlowheel steam transport Cumberland, Captain Rivers, No. 151, from Woolwich, for the Crimea, put into Plymouth Sound, wind-bound, on Monday. Assistant-Adjutzant-GeneralYorke, commanding the Royal Sappers and Mfiners, with htis official department, having been retained at Woolwich until the present moment in consequence of an insufficiency of room for their accommotion at Chatham, yesterday removed thence. Captain TiUey's 5th company is now the only portion of that corps stationed at Woolwich. The gunboat Forward, 2, Lieutenant Conimander Nelson, has arrived off Woolwich Arsenal from Deptford, to-receive her ammunition, &c., preparatory to joining the squadron. iThe pontoon mortar raft has returned to woolwich from Shoeburyncss, having gone through the second series of e$periments with Colonel Chalmer's 10-inch howitzer gun. Since the pontoon metal has been strengthened all tho experiments have turned out satisfactorily. consequently the raft has been pronounced in perfect service condition. A curious experiment was on Monday tried in the Arsenal marshes at Woolvich with a new description of shell, being the invention of a Mr. Stevens. A piece of wood fitting the bore of the gan was attached to a shell, according to the inventor's contrivance, to accelerate its flight, which he expected would be avery long one. Several of tho sheUs were then fired from a G0pounder gun, ane in elch instanee the wood was shattered inpieces, and the sheU rolled to a distance of about 200 yards. In fact, the experi-ment completely failed. The following promotions and appointments were made yesterday at the Admiralty: - The Rev. W. W. Campbell, Chaplain to the Dragon ; -John G. Barnes, Paymaster to the Archer,; A Rowe, C._. IarIs T. J. Ley, T. C. H. Shears, HenryGilpin, A. Ovey, AT T. M. Roberts, and B.

The colonel, Viscount Hinton, has promulgated an order to the regiment, in which he siates that Major-General Eden, the Commander of the Western District, has expressed himself in kind and flattering terms as to the efficiency of the regiment, and regretting its departure from his district. The Royal Conwall Rangers' 3Iilitia'Regiment, not being able to recrUit its strength up to 400 men by the time appointed, has been dissolved, but many of the men have entered regiments of the line. On Monday the South Mayo Rifles, numbering above 700 men, were drawvn up in the barrack-yard, Dublin, and, an order for volunteering into the reginents of the line having been read, more than 300 men at once stepped to the front. This number m.ay be considerably reduced on the usual inspection prior to passing, but serves to show the spirit by which the men are animated.
THE PUBLIC HRALTHI. (From the Reistrar-Genera1rs weeklv iet,nm. 1,151 deaths were registered in London during the week that ended on Saturday the 9th of February. The nunubex is below the averag, but it is 202 above the number in the previous week. 19 persons-namely, 9 children and 10 adults of 20 to 60 years of age, died of smallpox, 31 died of scarlatina, 42 of hoopingcough, and 65 of typhus, which is now the reigning epidemic. Of 137 persons who died of consumption 77 were of the age of 20-40, and 36 were of the age of 40-60. 40 persons died of apoplexy, 28 of paralysis, during the week, or 68 in the aggregate; whereas the deaths from these diseases in the week preceding were 20 fromn apople_y acd 13 from paralysis. These and other sudden deaths have been frequent, and account for a part of the increase in the mnortality. Bronchitis, pneumonia, and asthma were fatal in 236 eases, many of them probalbly terminations or modifications of influenza. 23 deaths from violent causes are recorded; 12: by burns and scalds, 2 by hangine, &c., I by suffocation, 2 by drowning, 3 bY fractures, 1 by wounds, and 2 by other causes. 570 males and 581 females died inthe week; 480 were children and young persons under 20 years of age; 189 were of the age 20-40; 206 were 4-60-; 224 were 60--O; and 42 were of the age of 80 and upwards. The oldest person who died in the week was of the age of 93 years. The births of 895 boys and 893 girls, in all 1,788 children, were registered in London. In the 10 corresponding weeks 'of the Years 1846-5 the average number was 1,596. At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the man height ,of the barometer in the week ending February the 9th was 29-840 in. The reading of the barometer increased from .2986 in. at the begining of the week to 29-95 in. by 10 h. :a.m. on the 3d; decreased to 29 85 in. by 3 h. p.m on the 4th; increased to 30-06 in. by 3 h. p.m. on the 3bh ; decreased to 29-54 in. by noon on the 7th; increased to ,29'90 in. by noon on the 8th; decreased slightly by j3h. p.m., and increased to 29-93 in. by 9h. p.m. on the same day then decreased to 29 80 in. by the end of the 'week.

The wind blew briskly firom the south-west, and rain fell on MWonday, Tuesday, and riday ; on Weduesday there was a new moon, accompaniedwitn a bard wind and driving misty rain. The mean temperature 'of the air was 44 0°, which is 5 9° above the average of the same week in 38 years. The entire range of temperature *duringthe week was 29-1°, the highest was oS 0° on Satur'day, and the lowest 2S-9° on Xonday.

UNIVERSITY INTELLWE2?'C?. OXFORD. Yrk 12. .ll -onviocation held tiUS day, a.t 3 'clolck, a deree wans kead), authorizing the addition of an Italian Teacher to that; staiff of teachers at the Taylor Institution. Mr. Xaael oE Eagdzlen (having requested leave of the Vice-Chancellor to. peaik in English). called the attention of Convocation to the faet thst the aetual amount of lecture days intrench andt German at the Taylor Instion was much less than thal; wrhich the statement in the Unimr'y Ciendhr woul afser,! toinimply. He believed this arose fronathe smalldemand formodera languages which had hitherto existed in the University, hot he thought that the openling of the Indian andtI ceivil sevices would lead to an increraedemonsd, and that oldstaptutes rshould we taken tonxieetoit. c e ,onclude& ty barmgtestimiony to the ability and diligene of thl ' preseut teachers in French and. Geran. The decree wat. then passed without onpomition. In a Congregation,whiels was held innnesditely aftev, several stauties were promulgated. On the Trstd, whie&a consisted chiefly of mere formal ilterations in somne of theL old statutes, and from which the obnoxiouzs clause, assigningg the organ-loltin the theatreto snusicaldoctors andbacheloiws at the time of the Commemoration, had been withdrawn bythe Coancil, no speaking took place. On the readinz o£ thet second-the statute dcDotationibts, the object of w h ir. to regulate the Craven Scholarships and the duties, stipends, modeof election, &c., of a number oftheprofesaors, theProfessor of Latin (3Ir. Conington) rose, and expretsed his. regret that he could not yet approve the Cravenregulations. W hile in many respects a fair compromise had been made, ire one the statute was more unsatisfactosythan before. It bad. formerly been proposed to assignthree-fourths of the Cavere funds to the new or open foundation, and one-fouith tothe old or close foundation. Kowr the proporton w.as: ehanged, aDd it ws nly proposed to assgnt fifths t the new foundation. The difference between threetoone,and'three to two was considerable. The proportion might. easily be restored by electing one scholar on thc old foundation each r-ear instea3 jof two. Mr. Chase, of Oriel, opposed. the clause by which the Savilian Professor of Astronomy is. proposea to be attached as a FeUow to Balliol College. H;e did not know -where the funds were to come from, and he feared the spoliation of Tiverton SchooL PerhapM some of the menbers of BaUiol present could exIlain. He thought the discussion of the subject was premature, as it was not known yet what the connissoners would determine in the matte.. Itwasobjectionable tohave the great question of the professoriat brought beforethe University piecemeal. There oughtto bea genermi scheme, and, if professors were to he attaced to colleges all collges ought to bave an even chance. He should object toa Balliol escaping a professor-rate on account of this endowmnent. The Master of Balliol (Dr. Scott) rose, ashehad. been almost called upon by the last "-er for explanation, but conceived that the points alluded to were such as it belongedratherto the college than to Congregation to consider_ Hle might mentionl, however, as Congregation had been ad.- vised to wait, and see what the commissioners would do., that the commi.ssioners were at nresent waiting to see what. Congregation and Convocation would do in the matter. Mr. Palmer, of Balliol College, pat in an amendment. to restore the original Proportion in the apportionmaent of the Cmven funds between the scholars of theold and new foundations. The statute concerning thev duties, stipends, &c., of the University Bedels vas then. read by the Registrar. The Principal -of St. Mary-halt (Dr. Bliss) opposed the statute. He objected to the meddlesameness of the Council, who sought to change everything. After sketching historically the fortunes of the office for, thelast 50 years, and showing that it had been held by mnen of learning and by gentlemen in every instance except onethat of a retired coachman-he concluded with moving that. the titles of Esquire Bedel and Yeoman Bedel be retained and that the stipend of the latter be 1501., instead of 1004 per annum. The Master of University (Dr. Plumptre) also> opposed the statute. He thought the existing number of Bedels (six) not at all too great. He did not wish to see thestipends diminished. Hethought it important that the posts should bc filled by gentlemen. Xe coneluded by moving: two amendments, the purport of-which we did not catch. Mr_ G. V. Cox, of New College (Esquire Bedel in Aits). thenm rose, and proposed a long series of amendments. He wva. thankfolto Dr. Bliss for his speech, andaviewed the Counci as a wFoman who, having obtained powere, was intoxicated. with it. Ho should suggest the ominssion of two entire, clauses in section 3, containing a r-enactment of the cereImony of laying dowrn and resumig the maces. If it werere thought important to preserve the ceremony, he would substitute fcr "every year," "atthe commencement of eack Vice-Chancellorship." He would also earnestly press the. restitultion of a clause omitted from the old statute, wherebythe office was held "during good behaviour." He would. that the existin Bedels should be called "Esqrire in the statutc. iinally, he would suggest a provision for supplying tbe place of the regular Bedelsim case of sickness, and for remunerating such Bedels as. should be required by the Vice-Chancellor to undertake, the office of his secretary. 3Mr. Neate, of Oriel, agreed vitl most of the objections which had been taken to the statute. He thought gradations of rank in the University very important, and regarded the office of Bedel as one which srved to give a competence to deservingpersons, who otherwise might bave remained in an inferior station. Ire particularly ridiculed the clause allowing the hiring of additional Bedels for occasions of greater ceremony. Mr.. Rawlinson, of Rxeter, would propose the omission ot that; clause altogether; it could not, b thought, be defended. If persons were wanted occasionally to do extra work, they might he hired, but he would not have them dressed n forshow. With regard to the reduction of number, it should be remembered by these who accused the Council of love ofchange, that the alteration had been suggested by the comiinittee ajppointed by the old Hebdomadal Board. Xec fur. ther proposed that the exemption secured to the SupariorBedel rn Arts in section 3 should be extended to all the, existing Bedels, and that some remuneration should hegiven to those caDled npon to perform extra duties. Dr, Punsey replied generally to the objections urged. Xe thought. It was not desirable to.havc gentlemen in sulch offices;* theBedcls were UIJIversity servants. High salariesinsuchaposi.. tion wrere no advantsge, bult -adisadvantage tothosepersonEs.i The duties of the Bedels had been greatly diminished byrecent statutes, and the newr duties wrere imposed in orderto give the Bedels something to do. With regard to theproposition to increase the number on state occasions, he -- must leave its defence to those who had obtained its insertion in the statute. He concluded by replying to some mis.- 1 statements which had hemn made in a printed paper circu.- lated in Commlon Eoomos. The debate then closed, and thegreater number of memboers left the house, while a short. shtatte making certain trifling alterations in the form ofappointing moderators was re.ad and promulgated. No. speaking took place on this promulgation, and the Congregation was dissolved at nearly 5 o'clock. -CA3IHIIUDGE, FZx. 12 liATVRAKI SctEB CES Ts'.re'OSJ 1856.
